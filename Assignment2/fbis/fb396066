<F P=106> [Article signed KV/PL: "European Union Protest Against </F>
Foreign Bank Discrimination in United States"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, in a joint letter addressed to the U.S. 
Government and Congress, the twelve European Union (EU) member 
states and the European Commission (EC) protested against a bill 
proposed by Congress to levy an extra tax on foreign banks. 
They express their concern over this threatened discrimination. 
  A November 1991 law gives the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) 
the option of auditing foreign banks and charging costs 
associated with these audits on to the financial institutions in 
question. U.S. banks are exempt from any charge resulting from 
Fed audits. 
  The law is the U.S. answer to the BCCI [Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International] scandal. There are an increasing number 
of votes in Congress that favor the implementation of this law. 
To date, the Fed has resisted pressure from Congress. A final 
decision will be made in April. 
  But the Twelve do not want to wait for this. The charge are 
additional to the costs which the banks have to pay in their 
home country for prudential auditing. This extra charge also 
affects only foreign banks and not U.S. banks. This is why the 
EU believes it to be discriminatory. It argues that the bill is 
an infringement of the principle of equal treatment and the 
"national treatment" which foreign banks have enjoyed so far in 
the United States. 
  The new initiative also goes against the principle of a 
"standstill," which was agreed upon by the OECD, and is 
certainly not going to help the future multilateral negotiations 
on the liberalizing of financial services. No full agreement 
was reached on this in the framework of the Uruguay Round. The 
participating countries can still modify or withdraw their 
commitments on access to their financial markets. 
<H5>  French Memorandum </H5>
  French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery yesterday issued a 
memorandum to his colleagues on the resumption of multilateral 
negotiations on the liberalization of financial services. He 
asks the EC to clarify the EU position. Paris wants to know 
whether the EU would more or less abandon the principle of 
reciprocity in the treatment of foreign banks, while the United 
States would respect it. Paris is not prepared to accept such a 
one-sided situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans by David </F>
Binar; place and date not given: "`If Netherlands Investors 
Were To Wait Until the Completion of the Privatization Process, 
There Would Be Nothing Left for Them, Says the Dutch Foreign 
Minister'"] 
  [Text] Netherlands Queen Beatrix begins a three-day visit 
to the Czech Republic today. To mark this occasion, the 
Netherlands Foreign Ministry granted a team of Czech journalists 
the opportunity to interview Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. 
  [Binar] How do you view, from the Netherlands perspective, 
the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance? Do you think that 
the path chosen at the January summit in Brussels -- the 
Partnership for Peace [PfP] -- will lead to the security 
integration of Europe? 
  [Kooijmans] It is not easy to explain why the Partnership 
for Peace formula was chosen. It was, however, important to 
avoid both Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla would be the entry of 
some countries into NATO, while others would remain outside. 
This would be a clear indication that there are new borders in 
the world, borders that could provoke a reaction from the 
countries languishing beyond them. This could threaten stability 
in Europe. Charybdis would be if it were said to all states 
that no form of cooperation is possible. 
  From the outset negotiations were to have been held equally 
with each country from Central and East Europe. However, during 
discussions among the allies, a concept was developed that took 
into consideration both the Scylla and the Charybdis; it was 
left up to the Eastern partners to decide how they will 
implement the Partnership for Peace. This allows for the 
possibility of gradual rapprochement and takes into 
consideration current developments on the European continent. 
Of course, it is clear that countries like the Czech Republic, 
Poland, and Hungary will enjoy closer relations with NATO than, 
for example, Kazakhstan or Georgia. 
  [Binar] The Partnership for Peace was adopted after Moscow 
began to express opinions opposed to the expansion of NATO. 
Both President Boris Yeltsin and the extreme right-wing leader 
Zhirinovskiy see a certain "threat" in the rapprochement between 
the alliance and the countries of Central Europe. What is your 
view? 
  [Kooijmans] First: It goes without saying that the alliance 
cannot allow its policy to be dictated by Russia. Second: 
There is a certain complementarity between the European Union 
[EU] and NATO. It has always been clear that when a country 
becomes a member of the European Union, it has to establish a 
certain relationship with the Western European Union (WEU) -- 
either as an observer or a member. There will come a time when, 
within the framework of Europe's integration, there will be a 
common foreign and security policy. Then, those states that 
currently have observer status will have to become members of 
the WEU. There is also a security guarantee here that 
complements NATO's security guarantees. In the case of the 
European partners, the United States is always involved within 
the framework of these guarantees. Therefore, it is logical 
that when a state becomes a member of the WEU, it also becomes a 
member of NATO. There is a certain logic here that must not be 
viewed as a threat by Moscow, because it is part of the European 
Union's overall concept. 
  [Binar] What is your opinion of mutual relations between the 
Netherlands and the Czech Republic? Are there any problem areas? 
  [Kooijmans] Our businessmen often have major problems in 
reaching specific agreements in the Czech Republic because of 
state bureaucracy and problems involving privatization. They 
also, unfortunately, receive no support from official quarters. 
  [Binar] Why, then, do your businessmen not wait until these 
problems have been resolved or why do they not link up straight 
away with the private owners? 
  [Kooijmans] If our investors were to wait until the 
completion of the privatization process, there would be nothing 
left for them. They want to invest their money in privatization. 
And, because privatization is being administered by the state, 
they have to turn to official quarters. It is important for the 
Czech Republic that this kind of report is not spread: "You 
want to invest in the Czech Republic? Wait, let me tell you 
about my experiences in that country." 
  [Binar] The Czech Republic's entry into the European Union 
is not, of course, on the agenda at the moment. Are there any 
opportunities for us to somehow come closer to it with the 
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty, which could potentially 
speed up our entry? 
  [Kooijmans] I think that cooperation among the Visegrad Four 
states is very important. It could become an example of how 
regional cooperation may contribute to entry into the European 
Union. It is very important to attain the EU standard in policy 
regarding the environment, ecological norms in production, and 
so on. Close cooperation in these sectors among the Visegrad 
Four will enable these states to achieve this standard more 
quickly. 
  The same applies for the social sphere. This involves, for 
example, labor safety norms. 
  [Binar] There is a certain cooperative structure among the 
Benelux states. Are there any parallels between this 
cooperation and the cooperation among the Visegrad Four 
countries? 
  [Kooijmans] Yes. In the past, the Benelux states offered 
the Visegrad Four countries help and advice concerning their 
closer cooperation. A meeting involving Visegrad Four and 
Benelux ministers was envisaged. However, to our surprise, the 
interest shown by the Visegrad Four in our experiences with 
Benelux was not too great. During my visits to the Visegrad 
Four countries, I have always said that it is very important not 
only that they orient themselves toward entry into the European 
Union, but also, at the same time, that they strengthen their 
economic and political ties. These countries will probably be 
the first ones from Central and East Europe to join the European 
Union. If there were a certain economic cooperative structure 
here, then this cooperation would make them more ready for 
membership in the European Union. Nevertheless, the Visegrad 
Four countries must not seek their future only in the European 
Union, but mainly in their own region. 
  [Binar] The Czech Republic is a relatively small state. Do 
you not think that our interest in EU membership entails the 
desire to have a share of the wealth enjoyed by the other member 
states? 
  [Kooijmans] It is wrong to view this as bargaining between a 
dwarf and a giant. It must not be forgotten that the country 
applying for admission is not the only one that would profit by 
the agreement. The benefit is mutual. I have been in the 
European Union for long enough to know that it is not an 
altruistic society. If the European Union had seen no advantages 
in its expansion, then it would not have begun any negotiations 
at all.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Calls For Close </F>
Cooperation Between Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Ter Beek has called for closer 
cooperation between the Netherlands Army, Navy and Air Force. 
The PvdA [Labor Party] spokesman also emerged as an advocate of 
the extension of military cooperation with Germany to all three 
armed forces. 
  Closer cooperation with other European armed forces is also 
called before, because the Netherlands must become more 
"continental" on the long road to some form of European defense. 
Ter Beek emphasized all this on Monday evening [21 March] in a 
speech given to the Atlantic Council in The Hague. Entitled 
"Past Analysis and Future Outlook," his speech provided a rough 
outline of defense policy in the near future. 
  According to Ter Beek, closer operational and logistic ties 
between the three armed forces are in the interests not merely 
of efficiency, but also of peace operations, which are demanding 
an increasing amount of cooperation. These advantages are more 
important than "the maintenance of independence and the specific 
culture of each of the armed forces." 
  Minister Ter Beek is of the opinion that the latest report 
by 
the Advisory Council on Peace and Security (AVV), entitled 
"Germany as a Partner," contains "valuable suggestions" with a 
view to extending Netherlands-German cooperation. The First 
Army Corps is already merging into a German-Netherlands Army 
Corps, confirmed the minister. 
  The AVV believes that the military links with neighbors in 
the East must be extended to the air force and navy. In the 
first instance this must involve far-reaching integration of 
both countries' naval and air forces and submarine services. 
Foreign Minister Kooijmans recently said he was less 
enthusiastic about selective links with the Germans in the area 
of the common foreign and security policy. 
  Ter Beek's speech before the Atlantic Council was, above 
all, 
a call for the continuation of the security policy he launched 
back in 1990, a policy of internationalization and 
Europeanization. "The choices we made were the right ones," he 
said. 
  Completion of the restructuring and rationalization program 
for the Armed Forces, from 130,000 to 70,000 men, is the central 
objective. "This requires that it is all quiet on the financial 
front," said the minister. He reiterated that with a 20-percent 
reduction in the defense budget since 1989, "the peace dividend 
has been paid out." In this, Ter Beek has the support of a 
majority in the Chamber, but his own party, the PvdA, wants to 
see a further 800 million guilders saved on defense during the 
following cabinet period. 
  The Netherlands will continue to participate in 
international 
peace operations, although there can be no question of it doing 
so automatically. Like Kooijmans, Ter Beek is not at all in 
favor of establishing criteria for deciding whether the 
Netherlands will or will not take part in peace operations. 
"There is no yardstick for doing so," claims the defense 
minister. "Strict criteria all too quickly turn into a 
straitjacket. Whether the Netherlands can and wants to 
participate will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The fear 
of some kind of `limitless interventionism' is unfounded," he 
continued. 
  Yesterday evening it was conspicuous that Ter Beek, contrary 
to current pessimism, appeared optimistic about international 
strategic developments. Although the situation in Europe is 
unstable, there are opportunities and bright spots: With the 
exception of Yugoslavia, the transformation process in Central 
and East Europe is running without too much violence; the shadow 
of a major military threat hanging over West Europe is a thing 
of the past; and reports on a swift death for NATO have proven 
to be premature. 
  According to Ter Beek, the Cold War now belongs 
"definitively 
to the past," even if the reformers lose out to the nationalists 
in the long run. If Russia becomes a military threat to its 
neighbors, "then the countries of Central Europe can be admitted 
to NATO in the short term."

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Shrimsley: "Germans May March in </F>
London's VE Parade"] 
  [Text] German troops could be invited to parade through 
central London as part of the celebrations to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the Second World War. 
  Mr John Major said yesterday that he wants Germany to play 
"a 
full part" in next year's VE-Day commemoration which will 
include a service in St Paul's and the parade through the 
capital. 
  The Prime Minister's comments reflect his concern to ease 
German feelings over their exclusion from this summer's D-Day 
celebrations and he has told Herr Helmut Kohl, the German 
Chancellor, that it is the 1995 end-of-war services which really 
count. 
  Herr Kohl is still smarting at his exclusion from plans for 
Western leaders to mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day with an 
Allied service of remembrance at Normandy. 
  His efforts to secure a place at the service were roundly 
rebuffed as other governments protested that D-Day celebrations 
should be restricted to those countries whose men died trying to 
liberate Europe and that a German presence would not be fitting. 
  In an effort to salve German pride Mr Major has stressed the 
importance of the 1995 celebrations to Herr Kohl, saying that 
would be the right occasion to mark the years of reconciliation 
and friendship which followed the Nazis' defeat. 
  Yesterday he showed his wish to avoid further offence in a 
Commons written answer to Sir James Spicer, the Tory MP for 
Dorset West. He said the commemoration in Britain on May 7, 
1995, "will be the occasion to celebrate the 50 years of peace 
and reconciliation we have enjoyed since 1945." 
  Mr Major said: "During that time we have developed extremely 
close relations with our allies and partners in Germany. We very 
much hope Germany will play a full part and be represented at a 
high level in the 1995 commemorations." 
  He went on to list the main events in the commemoration as a 
parade in central London, a service in St Paul's and a lunch or 
dinner for the heads of government who attend. Downing Street 
sources said that the plans were still at an early stage and 
refused to rule out the possibility of German troops or even 
ex-servicemen taking part in the parade . 
  Inviting members of the present German armed forces could be 
considered a suitable alternative and far less controversial 
than allowing German veterans to join the parade. MPs would 
argue that such men would represent the new Germany with which 
Britain is a close ally rather than the old enemy. 
  The proposals provoked a mixed reaction among Tory MPs, 
particularly those who served with the Armed Forces. 
  Sir James, a retired major who served in the Royal Fusiliers 
and the Paras, backed the decision. "We want to see a coming 
together and a remembrance of the past in order to avoid it ever 
happening again," he said. 
  But Sir Teddy Taylor, the Tory MP for Southend East, said: 
"There are still many people in Britain who have suffered severe 
loss of their loved ones -- fathers, sons, brothers and sisters 
-- and we should remember their tragedy first."

  [Text] Top Sinn Fein member Martin McGuinness today called 
for face-to-face talks with the Government. He said there was 
no hope of the peace process moving forward until the Downing 
Street declaration was clarified in open and direct discussions 
-- which could be completed "within a couple of days." 
  John Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Peter Mayhew 
have made it clear there will be no talks until there is a 
permanent end to IRA violence. 
  Mr McGuinness said the Government appeared to be in a state 
of "paralysis." But he added: "There's every prospect that the 
situation could move forward quite dramatically given the 
explanations which would be given at any discussions between 
Sinn Fein and the British Government." 
  He claimed the Goverment was trying to defeat republican 
resistance. "The ordinary people who have been fighting for 
their rights for so many years have no intention of surrendering 
to the British Government," he told BBC Northern Ireland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Alain </F>
Debove in Bonn; date not given] 
  [Text] Bonn -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
will visit Paris on Thursday, 24 March. He will deliver a 
lecture at the French International Relations Institute. He 
discusses here the misunderstandings that have disrupted 
Franco-German relations in recent weeks. 
  [Debove] What is the state of relations between Bonn and 
Paris following the misunderstandings of recent weeks? Are 
there still problems? 
  [Kinkel] Things must be put into perspective. I dispute the 
fact that there have been serious disagreements between Bonn and 
Paris. The French ambassador in Bonn had an unofficial meeting 
with the press. That prompted some irritation in Germany but 
this has meanwhile been cleared up. I had a detailed discussion 
with Alain Juppe, my counterpart, who is a friend; we both 
published communiques; the French ambassador amended his 
remarks; and I am now pleased to be going to Paris on Thursday 
for a visit agreed upon a long time ago. Contacts between the 
two countries are so diverse, close, and natural that even 
differing opinions on some questions -- such things happen to 
the best couples -- could not undermine the excellent bases of 
our relationship. 
  [Debove] However, there are minor tensions, for instance 
with 
regard to the commemoration of the 6 June landing.... 
  [Kinkel] Yes, this subject is playing a role, at least in 
the 
press in the two countries. But since 1945, France and Germany 
have always managed to commemorate with dignity the important 
dates of their common history. I will mention the meeting 
between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in Reims cathedral 
in 1963 and the joint commemoration which was attended by 
President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl at the Verdun cemetery 
in September 1984. There is no doubt in my mind that the French 
and Germans will also be able to celebrate in an appropriate way 
the end of World War II and Germany's return to the community of 
democratic states. 
  [Debove] There sometimes seem to be disagreements between 
Paris and Bonn on the question of the expansion and deepening of 
the European Union. 
  [Kinkel] I do not see things in that way. We think that 
expansion and deepening are necessary. Indeed, there are 
different concepts on this subject within the European Union -- 
but not between France and Germany. 
  [Debove] Is the Franco-German couple still the driving force 
of European building? 
  [Kinkel] After extremely difficult years, Germany and France 
have managed to establish preferential friendly relations and 
have been and will remain the driving force of European 
unification. As I have already said in the past, when France 
and Germany cooperate closely in Europe many things work; if 
France and Germany do not agree, many things do not work. 
  Franco-German relations have an essential importance for 
Europe and that must continue. I am deeply convinced of that 
and, since I have been foreign minister, I have personally 
contributed to realizing that objective by working for it in a 
practical way. The good relations with my French counterparts, 
first Roland Dumas and now Alain Juppe, have also had very 
positive effects in that way. We must ensure that there is not 
the slightest cloud over Franco- German relations. 
  [Debove] Do you think that expansion has not changed that at 
all? 
  [Kinkel] No. The expansion to four EFTA (European Free Trade 
Association) countries was decided jointly by the Twelve. I 
observed that, throughout the negotiations, France and Germany 
were always on the same side. There were therefore no problems 
between France and Germany in the negotiations on expansion, and 
we should not allow anybody to make us doubt that. 
  [Debove] Does that mean that we do not talk with each other 
enough? 
  [Kinkel] No. With regard to contacts between ministers, we 
have very close relations. That was the case between Roland 
Dumas and me. It is also true of the federal chancellor and 
other colleagues. We have jointly launched many common actions. 
I am thinking, for instance, of the Juppe-Kinkel initiative on 
Yugoslavia and our trilateral talks with Poland. I am thinking 
of what Alain Juppe and I have acheived together with regard to 
an association between the Central and East European countries 
and the WEU [Western European Union]. 
  At the level of experts, we have set up a joint working 
group 
on European questions, which has already met nine times. We 
must not allow people to make us believe that there is 
irritation which does not really exist in Franco- German 
relations. When we had differences of opinion on the subject of 
the Uruguay Round in the GATT framework or on the subject of the 
EMS [European Monetary System], I constantly pointed out that 
even good friends can sometimes face problems and have differing 
views on some subjects. 
  That is not worrying in the least; you just have to discuss 
the matter calmly, and that is what we did. France was able to 
rely fully on Germany's solidarity, especially on the difficult 
issues of recent times. And vice versa. From our viewpoint, 
for instance, France's attitude with regard to the question of 
Germany's seat on the (UN) Security Council and the support it 
gave us on the question of the European Central Bank played an 
important role. 
  [Debove] What will the next joint approaches be? 
  [Kinkel] One of the most difficult questions that Europe 
will 
have to settle will be that of the Central and East European 
countries' rapprochement with the European Union. As in the 
past, Franco-German relations will play an absolutely decisive 
role in the success of this process. And I will suggest to 
Alain Juppe, my counterpart, that we cooperate particularly 
closely in this sphere. 
  The French side has the greatest interest in the situation 
in 
the Maghreb. I will suggest mobilizing to clearly show that we 
are making a special commitment with regard to that region. On 
the continuation of the resolution of the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia, France and Germany will in the future have to 
continue to cooperate closely as they have done so far, and I am 
sure that this will happen. 
  [Debove] Following the Juppe-Kinkel initiative, should we 
not 
fear the establishment of a pax americana? 
  [Kinkel] I think that Alain Juppe, like me, was grateful to 
the Americans for becoming more involved in the Yugoslav 
question. France has shown an absolutely remarkable involvement 
in the former Yugoslavia. It has deployed more than 6,000 
soldiers there and has taken a very courageous attitude, with 
the president at its head. The Washington agreement really 
cannot be described as a pax americana. It is clear that in 
drawing up this agreement, the European action plan based on the 
Juppe-Kinkel initiative played an absolutely decisive role, and 
tribute was expressly paid to it during the signing in 
Washington. 
  [Debove] Will the transfer of the seat of government to 
Berlin be the sign of a change in Germany's foreign policy? 
  [Kinkel] The revolutionary upheavals in Central and East 
Europe and in the former Soviet Union, from which Germany 
benefited most through reunification, have led to changes in 
Europe which have naturally also led to changes in German 
policy. But I think that we have succeeded in not giving the 
impression that we have even the slightest intention of leaving 
the European Community's framework of interests in any way at 
all or abandoning the preferential relations between Germany and 
France. Quite the reverse. We still want to show restraint in 
our foreign policy, especially after reunification, which was 
only possible thanks to France and our European partners. 
  Our aim is not to secure any prerogative or any predominant 
position, but we want to remain integrated in the European 
Community of interests, in which Franco-German relations are and 
remain of special importance.

<F P=106> [Report by Dietrich Alexander: "Economics Crash Course for </F>
Former Russian Officers"] 
  [Text] This afternoon, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will 
inaugurate the Central Institute for the Conversion of Military 
Personnel (ZIKWOK). After the center in St. Petersburg and 
another in Moscow, it will be the third permanent institution in 
Russia intended to retrain former Russian officers with German 
help and prepare them for a civilian career. If everything 
works according to plan, then some 700 people will go through 
the Moscow center each year and receive commercial and computer 
training. The Central Institute is part of a purely bilateral 
program between Germany and four countries of the former Soviet 
Union: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. It is funded 
by the Federal Government with a total of 200 million German 
marks [DM]. With this program and a housing-construction 
scheme, Bonn has supported the withdrawal of the Soviet forces 
from the new laender since 1991. In 1991, the Russian Government 
published alarming figures, according to which some 50,000 
officers would resign from military service each year until 
1995. To this one must add the approximately 30,000 soldiers 
who will return home from Germany in August 1994 and will no 
longer serve in the Army. 
  Apart from the other two institutes in Russia and one each 
in 
Belarus and Ukraine, the ZIKWOK is the fifth functioning 
retraining center in the former Soviet Union. At the end of the 
year, when the German support program will expire, 14 centers 
should be able to offer training and retraining independently: 
nine in Russia, three in Ukraine, one in Belarus -- near Minsk, 
and one in Kazakhstan -- near Almaty. About 7,000 former 
officers per year will then undergo a crash course in economics 
in 25 different careers. 
  At the same time, retraining seminars are being held in the 
garrisons of the CIS forces in the new laender, which have so 
far been attended by 12,822 officers. After a public 
competition, a working group, headed by the German consulting 
company Gopa (Corporation for Organization, Planning, and 
Training), which is based in Bad Homburg, was commissioned to 
implement this program of the Reconstruction Bank and what was 
then the Soviet Labor Ministry. 
  Another retraining program is supported by the European 
Union 
with 12 million ECU (some DM23 million) as part of the program 
for technical assistance for the new independent states (TACIS: 
Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of New Independent 
States). With these funds, 16,000 officers who are resigning 
from military service are to be trained within the next three 
years in the field of Western marketing and management in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther has called for the speedy punishment of Kurdish 
offenders, without lengthy proceedings. "Whoever turns our 
aliens' legislation -- which is more liberal in Germany than 
anywhere else -- against us, will get an uncompromising 
response," he said this evening on the ARD programme 
"Brennpunkt." Criminal proceedings and aliens' legislation 
involving deportation and expulsion will have to cover the same 
ground where possible. The "obstacles to deportation within 
aliens' legislation" -- which includes "the threat of the death 
penalty, inhumane treatment or torture" -- must be taken into 
account. "If there is evidence of this in individual cases, the 
person cannot be deported," the politician stressed. "Our 
generous asylum legislation is being turned against us as a host 
country in an unbearable fashion through violence. Our asylum 
law must be supplemented by aliens' legislation," he added. 
Refugees and asylum-seekers could also be deported "provided 
they have been convicted of a serious offense." Many such 
offenses have no doubt been committed in the past few days.

  [Text] Contrary to initial reports, Kurds did not occupy 
the office of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] in 
Munich and St. Matthew's Church in the center of the town. 
According to the police, responsible officials let the Kurds 
in. About 20 demonstrators are in the church, and 13 in the FDP 
office. It was announced that the security forces are observing 
the situation. The Kurds stressed that they want to draw 
attention to the Turkish internecine war against the Kurdish 
people. In an interview with Deutschlandfunk this morning, the 
Turkish ambassador to Bonn, Oeymen, advocated the swift 
deportation of violent Kurdish criminals from Germany.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Kurds in the German Underground"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- So far, the ban on the militant 
Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has not had any effect on the 
illegal activities of the Kurdish extremist organization in 
Germany. According to findings by the security authorities, 
party activities on German territory "have been continued 
without any restrictions" -- again also with the use of force. 
Thus, the PKK has, for instance, once again tried to put 
massive pressure on its compatriots in Germany to extort support 
money and membership fees from them. 
  In addition, the PKK has meanwhile managed to establish 
successor organizations at the regional and local level for the 
35 "workers and cultural associations," "Kurdistan committees," 
and "solidarity centers" that were banned by FRG Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) last 
November. 
  Yesterday, Kanther announced a tough course against those 
Kurds who "variously and brutally abused" the German hospitality 
at the severe riots on the weekend. They must be expelled 
quickly. Even though in each individual case it must be 
investigated whether a foreigner is threatened with the death 
penalty in his homeland, one cannot "say at all that in Turkey 
all Kurds are persecuted." Yesterday, too, demonstrating Kurds 
blocked highways near Berlin, Bremen, Cologne, Giessen, and 
Frankfurt with burning car tires. Two Kurds sustained injuries 
when they drenched themselves with gasoline and set fire to 
themselves. 
  According to the security authorities, there are still about 
6,000 PKK followers operating in the FRG. Of the Kurds who live 
in Germany, a total of 40,000 are considered sympathizers of the 
Marxist-Leninist cadre party. Their goal: "Getting rid of 
foreign rule and reestablishing an independent Kurdish state" 
under the leadership of the PKK. 
  The Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office holds the PKK 
responsible for most serious crimes, including murder, attempted 
murder, serious bodily injury, and kidnapping. The leading 
functionaries of the PKK, including the entire Central 
Committee, the European Central Committee, the Executive 
Committee, and the "PKK killer commandos," are members of a 
terrorist association, in the view of the Karlsruhe office. 
  The ideological justification of the many violent crimes 
committed on German territory is provided by the "People's 
Liberation Army" (ARGK) of the PKK, which accuses the FRG of 
being responsible for the persecution of the Kurds because of 
its arms deliveries to Turkey. The "National Liberation Front 
of Kurdistan" (ERNK) has declared Germany to be "war enemy 
number two," just after Turkey.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Bavarian Minister President Edmund </F>
Stoiber by Elmar Oberhauser -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Oberhauser] Let us come to 
the topic of the European Union [EU]. You said today that 
Austria's entry would be a chance for Austria. However, the 
people in Austria have witnessed for some days now a violent 
controversy over the blocking minority within the EU. The 
question is increasingly asked whether this entry date of 
January 1995 that one is striving for can still be maintained. 
Is the EU not currently giving a terrible impression to an 
applicant for membership or a nation that wants to become a 
member? 
  [Stoiber] I agree with you because domestic policy problems 
in Great Britain are being shifted to the EU, and the behavior 
of the Spaniards, which is definitely too demanding, is also in 
the limelight. I can only say that those who upgrade the 
question about 23 or 24 votes as the Britons or Spaniards do -- 
I openly say it here -- wrong the spirit of the EU and the 
necessary development. We, the EU, have gone through most 
difficult negotiations with Austria, Finland, and Norway. In 
this way, Europe will be fantastically rounded off and this 
Western EU will develop into a pan-European union. Those who 
question this really have to expect most violent controversies. 
That is to say, my government, the Free State of Bavaria, but 
also Germany as whole, will do everything to dissuade the 
Britons from being stubborn in this respect. 
  Personally, I openly have to tell you that new entries and 
the enlargement of the EU are so important to me that I would 
finally swallow the bitter pill and not necessarily insist on 
the correct solution of 27 votes. That is to say, I give 
absolute priority to 1 January 1995 and it has to be pushed 
through. 
  [Oberhauser] Is that realistic? A few days ago, 
Parliamentary President Klepsch said on this program that the 27 
votes cannot be changed. 
  [Stoiber] This is the problem of the European Parliament. 
Certainly, if the Britons really do not move and continue to be 
uncooperative, one has to see, of course, the alternative. The 
alternative is that the four states cannot become members, which 
may be in the interest of one or another state. It may be the 
case that the Mediterranean countries say that there is no hurry 
regarding the entry of these strong countries. However, from 
the point of view of Germany, Europe, and Bavaria, this would be 
extremely disastrous because we simply need the Austrians to get 
the other Central and East European countries closer to the EU. 
The next would be Hungary, then the Czech Republic or Slovakia 
would come. Actually, Austria's function is to break things open. 
  [Oberhauser] Let us come back again to Germany, where one is 
talking of the superelection year of 1994. The Bundestag 
election is the focus of interest, also for politically 
interested Austrians. If one can believe the opinion 
researchers, although they have repeatedly been wrong lately, 
there are many indications that Kohl's era is coming to an end. 
Do you see it differently? 
  [Stoiber] This has often been the case, that is to say, it 
often looked like it. The reality was different. I am firmly 
convinced that Helmut Kohl will continue to be the chancellor, 
although I have certainly had many controversies with him, but I 
must openly say that one can see now the difficulties that 
Scharping has when something specific is at issue. That is to 
say, if he classifies those who earn 50,000 German marks per 
year in Germany as people with a better income and demands an 
additional tax of 10 percent from them, he deeply breaks into 
the group of skilled workers. This is also shown by the present 
controversies. 
  I also think that now that we have a chancellor who is 
absolutely recognized in Europe and the world in these difficult 
times, it would be disastrous in the field of foreign politics. 
One cannot call someone to this office who is really an 
apprentice in this question, as compared to the chancellor. 
  [Oberhauser] Putting it very cautiously, the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] seems to have difficulties. Is a grand 
coalition between the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian 
Social Union [CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] conceivable for you? 
  [Stoiber] No. The CSU stated several times that there will 
be no grand coalition with it in Bonn. Since the CDU/CSU can 
only make a uniform decision in this respect and the CDU, even 
if it wished this, had to show consideration for the CSU, there 
will be no grand coalition with the CSU and thus with the 
CDU/CSU in Bonn, unless there is a disastrous situation, which, 
however, is certainly not perceptible. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Minister-President, thank you for having 
been our guest. 
  [Stoiber] You are welcome. 
  [Oberhauser] Have a nice evening in Vienna. 
  [Stoiber] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brandenburg Minister-President Manfred </F>
Stolpe in Potsdam by Ulrich Wickert in Hamburg -- live] 
  [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Stolpe. 
  [Stolpe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, the coalition among the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD], the Free Democratic Party [FDP], and the 
Alliance 90 has collapsed. You are now heading a minority 
government. Is it possible for you to continue governing? 
  [Stolpe] Well, the most important news of the day for us in 
Potsdam is that the government is able to function, that the 
cabinet is complete, and that we can continue to fulfill the 
numerous tasks without delay. This is certain for the time 
being. Whether we will be able to achieve majorities on certain 
issues will simply depend on whether the solutions that we 
prepare are convincing -- solutions that were supported by many 
others during the preparatory phase, for example. Let me repeat 
this once more: The government will continue to function. 
  [Wickert] You have adopted an uncompromising attitude. You 
demanded that Mr. Nooke from the Alliance 90 should withdraw his 
statement that you lied about your past to the investigation 
committee, that there is no other way. Why did you adopt this 
tough position? 
  [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, this was not toughness. I was simply 
interested in clarifying the matter. All my friends and I had 
the impression that the fact that I was condemned in advance was 
no longer a basis for cooperation. In addition, we had the 
feeling that one of our -- former -- partners was interested in 
exacerbating the situation and in ensuring that additional 
questions were raised and more documents were provided. 
Cooperation was simply no longer possible. I had no high 
expectations. I only asked for a withdrawal of the advance 
condemnation and suggested waiting until the investigation 
committee presents its results. I also asked for a certain 
reliable cooperation in the interest of the tasks that have to 
be fulfilled. My wishes were ignored, and thus we are no longer 
three partners but only two -- the Social Democrats and the 
Liberals. 
  [Wickert] Well, you will have to continue governing. There 
have been contradictory statements by officials from the 
Christian Democratic Union. On the one hand, new elections are 
demanded, but on the other, it has been assumed that new 
elections will not take place because the Landtag members are 
not yet eligible for a pension. 
  [Stolpe] This is certainly not the only reason. You must 
also take into consideration that elections are scheduled for 11 
September anyway. In fact, I am interested in completing 
important tasks in a sensible way. The citizens of Brandenburg 
are simply entitled to good results of our work. Early 
elections would only be the last resort if we were no longer 
able to function. However, since this is not the case, I 
believe we will be able to conclude our work successfully. 
  [Wickert] You are saying that this is not the case. Yet 
since you are now heading a minority government, you must be 
tolerated. Will you also accept toleration by the Party of 
Democratic Socialism? 
  [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, in the Brandenburg Landtag -- as in 
other landtags -- the results are important. There is always 
the possibility of coming to an agreement in the committees. 
Even when the coalition among the three parties still existed 
and we held clear majorities in the committees, we also took 
into consideration the views of the opposition. We purposefully 
sought agreement on certain issues. I suppose that this will 
pay off in the next few months. The issues that we still have 
to settle have largely been supported by all members of the 
Landtag. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, this was the first coalition between 
the SPD, FDP, and Alliance 90 in Germany at the provincial 
level. Can you imagine that such a coalition might also work at 
the federal level, or was yours an individual case? 
  [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, we have never claimed to be a model. 
We have always been aware that we have a special situation here 
east of the Elbe or in eastern Germany. Three years ago when we 
assumed office people predicted that the coalition would not 
even last 100 days. We have managed to survive over three years. 
We struggled to reach joint positions and have done a good job. 
I would say that this was useful for Brandenburg. However, we 
do not claim that it should serve a model for other governments. 
  [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Stolpe. 
  [Stolpe] Good evening.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Reitz: "Herzog in the Fray; the </F>
Chancellor's `Second Choice' Self-Confidently Celebrates 
Independence From Helmut Kohl and Richard von Weizsaecker"] 
  [Text] Helmut Kohl's enthusiasm for his "second choice" 
remains within bounds. The chancellor, who for more than 11 
years has spent 14 to 16 hours a day wallowing in government 
business, has a firm opinion about the merry epicure: "He is 
lazy." 
  It is not just Kohl who knows about the unresolved mountains 
of files of the president of the Constitutional Court. 
  A "cordial unrelationship" links the two of them, 
according to one of Kohl's ministers. Herzog is by no means 
"Kohl's candidate of the heart." For the leader of the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union], the situation with the law 
professor, Herzog, is similar to that with the aristocrat, 
Richard von Weizsaecker. He did not want the one whom he got. An 
irony of history. 
  No, Roman Herzog will not be a federal president with the 
chancellor's favor (if he does become president). The free 
thinker is self-confidently celebrating his independence. 
  It was Tuesday of last week [8 March] in the Bonn Water 
Works, the makeshift plenary hall. They were freely discussing 
Herzog's candidacy and there was a general setting of boundaries 
by Kohl, by Weizsaecker, and by Heitmann. 
  The friend of clear words contrasts his program to Kohl's 
nebulous rhetoric: "We must speak as clear as glass in this 
state." 
  He himself adhered to unity at a time when that was not 
customary "in this land of ours," says Herzog. "In this land of 
ours," Kohl's patriotic formula until the cabaret performers 
ruined it for him. A scornful laugh goes through the hall. Once 
again Herzog got carried away with his sarcasm ("my worst 
fault"). 
  Things that were taken for granted for 40 years must be 
examined. Forty years: that includes Kohl's time in office. In 
family policy, for example. Those without children ought to pay 
compensation for the families: "That will cost a lot of money." 
Herzog mentions Hannelore Roensch. After she made this proposal, 
the family minister had to accept a reprimand from Kohl. Herzog 
now nonchalantly vindicates her: "A demonstration," is how a CDU 
elector later judges his performance. 
  Setting of boundaries, part two: Weizsaecker, who 
found the parties to be "obsessed with power" and who fed the 
displeasure with them, is corrected. Herzog: "The political and 
social stability of the last 40 years comes from our party 
system." Before that in an interview, the president of the court 
had accused the parties of a lack of capacity for integration 
and had warned against another Weimar. Was there something to 
that? 
  Steffan Heitmann's clumsy ideas about national 
socialism were the last nail in his coffin. Herzog chats about 
the time of the Nazis without a written speech. Alluding to 
Oskar Lafontaine, he talks about secondary virtues that made 
concentration camps possible. Of course, Herzog admits affably, 
one can run a concentration camp with diligence and punctuality. 
But secondary virtues are supposed to be more than that: 
interpersonal relations, respect, politeness. "Then I would like 
to see the concentration camp that can be run that way." 
Performance of duty, punctuality, diligence--these virtues ought 
to be employed for human dignity and liberty. Herzog gets past 
the reefs but just barely. Afterwards electors say that they 
held their breath when they heard this passage. It awakens 
memories of Philipp Jenninger, who hit the wrong note in his 
rhetoric about national socialism and therefore had to be 
replaced as president of the Bundestag. But Herzog is not 
Henninger. 
  Herzog's singular characteristics--they also 
include his sensitivity. The president can dish it out, but he 
cannot take it so well. 
  Friedrich Karl Fromme, domestic-policy chief of the 
newspaper 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, took the candidate Heitmann under his 
wings. The editorial writer is now reprimanding Heitmann's 
successor Herzog as scarcely anyone else is. Fromme knows the 
scene of the jurists. Herzog knows that and therefore this hit 
him hard. 
  And so he is getting revenge publicly with the 
publicists--in 
front of this team from the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union]. 
Fromme (Herzog does not mention his name, because that would be 
giving him too much honor) is a "nationally known sourpuss." 
Kohl, who eats up journalists, never went that far. 
  When Richard von Weizsaecker came down from his 
aristocratic-presidential Olympus to accuse the parties of being 
obsessed with power, Norbert Bluem responded to him in DER 
SPIEGEL: "Welcome to the tumult, Mr. Federal President." 
  Roman Herzog, the uncrowned interview king of recent weeks, 
has long since arrived in the tumult of the fast-paced 
altercation. Unemployment, integration of foreigners, Europe, 
family policy: Herzog knows the answers. 
  In accordance with the traditional pattern, the altercation 
sometimes leans to the left and sometimes to the right. It is 
something that they cannot get hold of politically--an 
unpredictable factor for the CDU. Its program: Herzog is Herzog. 
  The tempermental Bavarian by birth does not want to stay out 
of the daily political discussion. After all, he is one who 
speaks his mind. 
  Where is it written in the constitution that a president 
must 
be a substitute emperor?

Germany] in the election for the Lower Saxon Landtag represents 
a personal victory of its top candidate. Minister-President 
Schroeder knew how to show himself to be the more experienced 
candidate relative to his challenger Wulff. But can one conclude 
from this that the three-time winner Chancellor Kohl will 
prevail in the same manner over his young challenger Scharping 
in the Bundestag election? That would mean that the experience 
and routine of the top candidates decide elections. But what 
about the other qualities of the matadors? Furthermore: Is it 
really just a duel between the chancellor candidates in which 
the parties do not count at all? Does anyone want to assert that 
the SPD would have lost its mandate to govern in Lower Saxony if 
it had not been for Schroeder or that the CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] will win the Bundestag 
election despite its weakness because it has Kohl? 
<H5>  Schroeder as the Trump Card </H5>
  In any case, it is true in this respect that Schroeder was 
the best trump card of the SPD in Lower Saxony. Only he made 
possible what a minority of 22 percent had expected and only 37 
percent had wanted: the SPD gained the absolute majority of the 
seats. About half the voters prefer him as minister-president, 
according to the latest surveys of the Election Research Group 
in Mannheim (it works for ZDF [German TV Two]) and the Infas 
Institute in Godesberg (it works for ARD [German TV One]). On 
the other hand, only a good fifth (according to Infas) to 
one-third (according to the Election Research Group) expressed 
themselves in favor of Wulff. Corresponding with this is the 
fact that the voters between the Ems and the Elbe assess 
Schroeder better (plus/minus 1.4 on a scale of from plus 5 to 
minus 5) than the SPD. But the first crack in this explanation 
appears when one notes that Wulff (plus 1.2) also appears better 
than the land-CDU in the eyes of the voters of Lower Saxony. The 
second crack arises in the fact that it is not Kohl (a meager 
minus 0.3 on the scale of the Election Research Group) who is 
judged better by the voters of the entire nation but Scharping 
(a likewise less than exciting plus 1.1). Of course personally 
Kohl was never brilliant in preelection polls. 
  But whenever Kohl triumphed, he had a two-stage rocket to 
thank for it: the first stage that advanced him a considerable 
distance was the confidence in the economic competence of the 
Union. The second stage was the expectation that Kohl would be 
best able to apply this competence. The two-stage rocket still 
exists and in times of economic crisis it is even the best 
wonder weapon in elections. In Lower Saxony, however, it was not 
the CDU but rather the SPD that ignited this rocket. What at 
least a relative majority normally attributes to the CDU is now 
expected of the SPD by the biggest share of the voters: the key 
qualification of sound economic policy. The pollsters see this 
expectation of the economic competence of the SPD not only in 
Lower Saxony, but also everywhere in Germany. 
  In Lower Saxony, then, the confidence in Schroeder and the 
hopes for the SPD have reinforced each other. Only rarely has an 
economic theme been so much in the foreground of an election 
campaign: almost 70 percent of those eligible to vote 
characterized unemployment as the biggest problem; far behind in 
second place (15 percent) was environmental pollution. Ten days 
before the election, the Allensbach Institute for Opinion 
Polling found out that it was above all the unemployed and their 
families who are more likely to believe that the SPD rather than 
the CDU can solve the problems in Lower Saxony (45.5 to 17.6 
percent). But the population as a whole also believed the SPD to 
be more competent (34.5 to 18.5 percent). There is also the 
impression that Schroeder radiates optimism (61.1 percent 
believe this). That also explains why 8 percent of the 
SPD-voters came over from the CDU, according to a calculation by 
Election Research Group. Where Schroeder got personally involved 
to save industrial jobs, the SPD even gained votes in the 
election in Lower Saxony. Often the voters do not want to 
recognize the connection between the combatting of unemployment 
and economic performance, and they attribute to the SPD more 
ability to reduce unemployment, whereas they see the CDU as 
having more competence to get the economy moving. The thrust is 
much greater when the voters see both capabilities united in the 
SPD. 
  With Kohl, the Union will hope that those eligible to vote 
do 
not really believe that. It will say to itself that the voters 
are only half serious about an election of the landtag, but are 
totally serious about a Bundestag election. As a matter of fact, 
there was a hint in February that the CDU was recovering: in the 
mood barometer of the Election Research Group, it rose by 4 
percentage points to 35 percent in Germany as a whole, and the 
SPD fell 2 percentage points to 42 percent. But the gap is still 
seven points and that is a lot. It is even larger in the 
Allensbach survey for this newspaper: there the SPD led by 13 
percent at the beginning of March, having 47 percent compared 
with 34 percent for the CDU. To be sure, the CDU would have done 
even worse in Lower Saxony if the election had been in January. 
Its slight recovery in all of western Germany stands against 
further lost votes in the east. 
  The second advantage of the SPD is that it appears to have a 
secure coalition partner, whereas the CDU does not. Just as in 
Hamburg, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] will not be in the 
Lower Saxon Landtag either. It lost 1.6 points and that is 
devastating for a small party. And presently things do not look 
better for the Free Democrats in the nation as a whole. In 
mid-February, the Election Research Group signaled that for the 
first time since the last Bundestag election the FDP had fallen 
below 5 percent in all of Germany; also in mid-February, the 
Allensbach Institute for Opinion Polling registered only 4 
percent for the FDP and by the end of February and beginning of 
March it was a paper-thin 5 percent. A comparable weakness under 
conflicting conditions (participating in the government in Bonn 
and in the opposition in Hannover) will prolong the FDP's 
uncertainty until the Bundestag election on 16 October. The FDP 
lacks a personality like Genscher. It is a matter of two things: 
the party and its top people. 
<H5>  Splinter Parties in a Downward Trend </H5>
  The results in Lower Saxony confirm what polls are signaling 
for all of Germany: the splinter parties will not be in the 
Bundestag, although it cannot be overlooked that the 
Republikaner achieved 5 percent in 13 of 100 electoral districts 
of Lower Saxony. On 16 October, there will be only one fateful 
decision: will the FDP also shrink down to a splinter party? In 
this election year, the voters appear to be thinking about the 
big parties. The "party of the nonvoters," as Infas calls it, 
has not--contrary to what previously happened in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, and 
Brandenburg--grown into the strongest party. Return to normalcy? 
What would be normal without the FDP? With the Greens as a 
normal party, normalcy would shift to the left.

<F P=106> ["for"-signed report: "Waigel: SPD Will Increase Debts to </F>
Record High"] 
  [Text] Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social 
Union -- CSU) has called the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany's [SPD] tax plans a "fiscal disaster" and a "deliberate 
deception of voters." With a wild mixture of fiscal programs and 
promises, the SPD is writing the population "a wealth of 
unsecured blank checks." Enforcing the 20 expenditure measures 
contained in the SPD program would increase public debts to a 
record high. Tax increases would be accordingly large. Under 
the SPD's monetary guidelines, people earning over 4,000 German 
marks [DM] net per month -- this includes qualified workers -- 
would have to expect a higher tax burden. 
  Waigel called the tax increases on higher assets a "job 
creation program for Monaco, Liechtenstein, and certain parts of 
Switzerland." The figures published imply that the levy on 
property would increase six-fold, which would cause a large 
amount of mobile capital to flow abroad. The minister also 
criticized the SPD's plan to introduce an "ecological tax 
reform," which should levy the incurred costs on the given means 
of transport. In Waigel's view this would increase gasoline 
prices to DM4 to DM5. The SPD's overall concept leads to "a 
fiscal and economic fumble." 
  According to AFP, the Free Democratic Party of Germany's 
[FDP] economic expert, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, speaking on RTL 
television, accused the SPD of a "high degree of negligence." 
"This is an incredible policy, thoughtless and unprofessional." 
The Social Democrats "cannot handle money, nor can Mr. 
Scharping." The chairman of the German Employees' Union, Roland 
Issen, demanded that the SPD increase the income level for the 
supplementary tax to DM80,000 for single people and DM160,000 
for married couples. A ceiling of DM60,000/120,000, "still hits 
the majority of average income earners in the country." 
According to Issen, "these are net incomes in the DM3,200 to 
DM3,500 range." In addition to a supplementary tax, labor and 
employment policy must be financed "through a general labor 
market levy" to be paid for by everyone. 
  The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimates 
that the government's tax plans -- a 7.5-percent solidarity 
surcharge as of 1 January 1995, payable by everyone -- would be 
a heavier burden on the economy than the 10-percent 
supplementary tax on gross incomes over DM60,000/120,000 
envisaged by the SPD. According to ASSOCIATED PRESS, Dieter 
Teichmann, the DIW's fiscal policy expert, told the NEUE PRESSE 
in Hannover: "If the lower incomes are exempted from the levy, 
as suggested by the SPD, this will have a positive effect, 
because those earning lower incomes consume comparatively much 
and save little." 
  This means that the loss in private consumption would be 
lower with the SPD model than with the government's solidarity 
surcharge, even if the SPD wanted to achieve the same revenue of 
DM23 billion to DM25 billion. Only people liable to taxes on 
salaries and wages, would keep DM14 billion more than under the 
government's model. 
  Ruediger Pohl, president of the Institute for Economic 
Research in Halle, however, warned against introducing a 
supplementary tax and demanded a cut in expenditure instead of 
an increase in tax progression. Pohl told the Cologne EXPRESS: 
"If a supplementary tax is levied on those earning higher 
incomes, this will primarily have a negative effect on the 
economy. The new debate on taxes does not only make the 
citizens feel insecure, but it also unnerves businessmen." With 
tax progression increasing to such an extent, investors will 
consider investing in financial assets abroad instead of buying 
machinery in Germany. This will get worse if the income limit 
for the supplementary tax on single people is increased to 
DM60,000 or more. 
  The former member of the "Wise Men of Economics" is 
basically 
opposed to a tax increase, but he thinks that if taxes must be 
used to finance public deficits, the burden should be widely 
spread, also including lower incomes -- as the solidarity 
surcharge model suggests.

<F P=106> [Article by Elizabeth Noelle-Neumann, head of the Allensbach </F>
Institute: "The Myth of the Nonvoter: The Germans Do Not Vote 
Rationally, But They Do Vote"] 
  [Text] In 1993 there were no big elections. The prevailing 
opinion then was that the biggest of all parties is that of the 
nonvoters. The election in Lower Saxony has shaken this 
conviction. At 73.8 percent, the voting participation last 
Sunday [20 March] was not even 1 point under that of 1990. 
  The theory of nonvoting had proceeded from a false 
assumption. If the Germans are annoyed with politics, they vote 
nevertheless, even if for other than the usual party, perhaps an 
extremist one. Thirty percent of the eligible voters in western 
Germany say that they have already voted out of protest for a 
party for which they would not have voted otherwise. Only 14 
percent, on the other hand, have ever failed to vote out of 
discontent. But the protest vote is the opportunity of the small 
parties. 
  For this reason, the "concentration point" of the German 
party system, expressed in the combined share of the second 
ballot vote of the two people's parties, could decrease further 
in the Bundestag election in the fall. In the 1970's it was over 
90 percent. Since 1980 it has been decreasing. In the Allensbach 
surveys of 1993 only 73 percent on the average still intended to 
vote for the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union--CDU/CSU] or the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. 
  Those who turn away from the people's parties do so mostly 
to 
give their vote to a smaller party. Only a few stay away from an 
election out of protest. Nonvoters are, for example, young 
people who as yet have little interest in politics and for whom 
voting is not yet civic duty and habit. Or they are elderly 
women, who after the death of their husbands no longer go to 
vote because no one takes them along. Nonvoters mostly have no 
interest in politics. They frequently come from the lowest 
social strata. For the heroic, protesting "party of nonvoters" 
there is very little left. 
  Why does the voter vote the way he votes? A public opinion 
researcher who inquires directly into the reason for a voting 
decision could just as well ask: "Why are you Catholic?" or "Why 
are you Protestant?" Such questions do not lead to anything, for 
hardly anyone would answer: "Because I was born into a Catholic 
(or Protestant) family." But in many cases this would be the 
right answer. How, then, are the reasons for a voting decision 
to be recognized? 
  "What on the whole was your family's political attitude, how 
far positioned to the left, in the center, or the right?" it was 
asked in February and March 1994. And: "How would you describe 
your own political position?" It became evident that in most 
cases the political position of the parents continued with the 
children. If, for example, a family is positioned "strongly to 
the left," the children in 4 of 10 cases, too, are positioned 
strongly to the left. Only 11 percent of the children from such 
families acknowledge themselves as belonging to the center. But 
in the political center or on the right, too, the generation of 
the parents in most cases passes on its views. 
  Whether people vote regularly, too, is influenced by whether 
father and mother regularly went to vote. The much used concept 
of "political culture" really does apply in voting. Because 
tradition is so important, it is frequently impossible to 
uncover rational reasons for voting decisions through direct 
questions. 
  The liberal theory of "rational choice" cannot be applied to 
voting decision and political loyalty in Germany. Hardly half of 
the voters expect personal advantages if the preferred party 
does well. 
  Tactical calculations, too, such as not wanting to waste 
one's vote, are only marginally effective. It was asked: "Would 
you vote for a party which may not get over the 5-percent hurdle 
and thus not get into the Bundestag or the Landtag, or would you 
not bother to vote for a party that is not certain to qualify?" 
More than half of all Germans and more than 80 percent of the 
followers of smaller parties say: "I would nevertheless vote for 
such a party." 
  Germans vote out of habit or tradition, and they regard 
elections as purposeful. They are not tempted by the idea that 
among 60 million eligible voters their vote is only a drop in 
the ocean, not worth going to the polling station for in the 
first place. One question asked: "Sometimes it is said that 
going to vote, after all, makes no sense. Do you at times, too, 
have this feeling, or do you not have such a feeling?" To be 
sure, 47 percent in western Germany and 54 percent in eastern 
Germany know this feeling. But as soon as one probes less 
directly and, for example, searches for associations with the 
word "voting," another picture emerges. The association 
"senseless" then is in next to last place; almost 70 percent 
say: "No, one cannot think of this in connection with `voting!'" 
Instead 86 percent say: "In connection with `voting' one can 
think of `important.'" Eighty-four percent associate 
"codetermination"; 64 percent think of "duty." 
  Here lies the core of the political culture, closely 
connected with the belief in the value and superiority of 
democracy. Feelings play a large role. "When you have gone to a 
Landtag election or a Bundestag election and have voted, do you 
then have a good conscience, or have you never had such a 
feeling?" it was asked. Forty-nine percent answered: "I then 
have a good conscience." Or another question: "Do you know the 
feeling of having helped a party with your vote, or do you not 
know such a feeling?" Fifty-five percent reply: "I know" such a 
feeling. And time and again, when dealing with the subject of 
voting, one encounters the role of the parents. In the case of 
great closeness to the parents, young people in 79 percent of 
the cases say that going to vote is a kind of duty. Among those 
who are less close to their parents, only 43 percent say this. 
In response to the question of whether they will go to vote in 
the Bundestag election in the fall, 69 percent of those who have 
a close relationship with their parents say: "Certainly I will 
go and vote"; among those who are distant only 44 percent say 
this. 
  Probably it has to do with the large role of tradition that 
the program of the preferred party is regarded as more important 
than the top politicians of this party. The program, that is the 
values of the family tradition. The politicians change. 
  Sixty-three percent say that there is a party for which they 
generally vote. The democratic political culture is evidently 
much stronger than the feeling of political homelessness, and 
election years are high points in the consolidation of this 
culture. 
  This also illustrates the magnitude of the task of letting a 
democratic political culture grow up in the eastern laender. 
When one hears words, one can, after all, have different 
feelings, whether one likes them or not. How about the word 
"voting?" "A sympathetic word," say 51 percent of the west 
Germans, with 18 percent opposite votes. Quite differently the 
east Germans: The 38 percent who regard "voting" as a 
sympathetic word are opposed by 29 percent: "Voting is 
unsympathetic." 
<H5>  The Public Opinion Climate in March: The Union at a Low Point </H5>
  The forecasts of the polling institutes about the election 
in 
Lower Saxony were not bad. But, of course, they would have been 
wrong had the public opinion researchers taken their findings 
about the voting intentions of people at face value. In 
Allensbach, for example, the raw figures for the election in 
Lower Saxony were as follows: SPD 52.5 percent, CDU 28.5 
percent. This did not correspond to the subsequent election 
results. At the same time, however, the information about how 
people voted in the end was distorted. The SPD share of the 
votes was much too high, the CDU share--much too low. If this 
was corrected and the almost 40-percent undecided, on the basis 
of their answers to other political questions, were apportioned, 
the results were 45.2 percent for the SPD, 35.4 percent for the 
CDU--very nearly the precise subsequent election result. All 
German polling institutes today adjust their findings in this 
manner. 
  What is the source of such distortion of information in 
interviews? People do not lie. They find themselves under the 
pressure of the opinion climate. At the moment the CDU/CSU finds 
itself in a serious opinion climate low. Sixty-four percent of 
all those polled believe that at present most Germans do not 
like the Union. Only 11 percent say that people really like the 
CDU/CSU. It is different with the SPD. Forty-four percent are of 
the opinion that the SPD is well received, 21 percent contradict 
this. In such a climate, a spiral of silence develops. Those who 
feel threatened by the opinion climate become silent, refuse an 
interview, or declare themselves undecided when asked about 
their preferred party. The party which is under opinion-climate 
pressure is underestimated in surveys. Only through "political 
weighting" can one come close to the real strengths of the 
parties, for example now, in February/March 1994, for Germany as 
a whole 38.3 percent say they will vote for the SPD, and 32.5 
percent for the CDU/CSU. The FDP, with 9.1 percent is far above 
the 5-percent hurdle and likewise Alliance 90/Greens with 11.5 
percent. Accordingly, the Germans give the SPD and Alliance 
90/Greens far better chances in the coming Bundestag election 
than the CDU/CSU and FDP. Only 22 percent expect a victory of 
the present coalition, but 46 percent believe red and green will 
win. 
  But people know how ephemeral such estimates are seven 
months 
before the Bundestag election. Only 6 percent believe that the 
Bundestag election "has already been decided." For 81 percent, 
however, everything is still open.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephan Schlote: "Ordered Blind; How the German </F>
Manufacturers Intend To Regain Lost Ground in International 
Competition"] 
  [Text] They did not make the grade, and one person knows 
why: "In this industry," says Volkswagen boss Ferdinand Piech, 
"no one has done his homework." Except for BMW, all German 
carmakers are closing the year 1993 with red figures. Overall 
grade for Germany's carmakers: Failed. 
  A new generation of managers is now expected to change the 
course of the automotive industry. Unlike in any other sector of 
the German industry, almost all of the veteran executive boards 
of carmakers were removed. Achim Diekmann, manager in the 
automotive industry association: "After the crisis the industry 
has a totally different look." During the coming week at the 
Geneva Autosalon it will make its debut. 
  The collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and Nicolas Hayek, 
the inventor of the Swatch car is only one, albeit very 
striking, example. Mercedes, the Swabian brand of tradition, 
banks on the collaboration with the automotive newcomer Hayek. 
Mercedes boss Helmut Werner: "Hayek can always be counted on for 
innovative and clever ideas." 
  This is but a fraction of the "revolution" that the Mercedes 
boss had promised one year ago when taking office: Roughly 
11,000 jobs have been cut by the Stuttgart people in 1993 alone, 
another 8,000 will be eliminated in 1994. Mercedes must get out 
of the red, "however, merely stolidly reducing jobs," Werner 
recognizes, "is not the solution." Unlike any other manufacturer 
in Germany, Mercedes is expanding its line of products. In 1995, 
the new full-size Viano from Basque Vitoria is entering the 
market, and starting in 1996 the Bremen plant will build the 
small SLK roadster. The production of the small A-class starts 
1997 in Rastatt, practically coinciding with the opening of the 
first foreign Mercedes plant in the U.S. state of Alabama. An 
all-terrain recreational vehicle is produced there, whose 
production figures are already in the black even with half the 
capacity of 30,000 cars annually. 
  By the end of the decade Werner plans to produce one-tenth 
of 
the cars beyond the German borders und thus once and for all 
replace "Made in Germany" with "Made by Mercedes." In the year 
2000, Mercedes intends to produce roughly 900,000 cars 
worldwide--about 400,000 more than in 1993. "One of the major 
weak points in the German automotive industry," as the study by 
the Deutsche Bank Research states, "the lack of globalization" 
will then have been eliminated. 
  Werner is taking decisive measures. Only recently he reduced 
the board by two heads, cut two hierarchical levels, and divided 
the entire corporation into performance centers. A decision was 
made to build a central development center for roughly DM800 
million, and an amount of DM18.7 billion was committed for 
capital expenditures planned from 1994 to 1998--10 percent less 
than previously. Werner's trick: Within the next five years 
Mercedes will invest about 1 billion marks [DM] additionally in 
products but less in machines. 
  Mercedes reduces the fraction of company-produced assets by 
5 
percentage points to 40 percent, and, using a new purchasing 
model called "tandem," the subcontractors are also getting their 
chance. The basic principle: Mercedes does not demand lower 
prices unless the suppliers can actually produce at lower cost. 
Mercedes annually purchases parts worldwide for roughly DM20 
billion. 
  However, Manfred Remmel, head of purchasing, plans to save 
about 6 billion by 1997. Simple solution: Build simpler cars. 
The technology-crazy Germans have always loved things 
unnecessarily complicated. "We have to provide more than 3,600 
different exhaust manifolds," complains Konrad Ellegast, deputy 
board chairman of Phoenix AG, the Hamburg automotive supplier. A 
comparable company in Japan needs 300--but also has fewer 
subcontractors. In Germany every second one is going to fall by 
the wayside. 
  During his first year in office Helmut Werner has already 
decreased expenses by DM4 billion, in round figures. The Swabian 
carmaker continues to give payroll increases only on scale. 
Commentary by the French Banque Paribas in a current company 
analysis: "Mercedes is on the right track." 
  The competition from Munich actually has arrived there some 
time ago. Even during the down-year of 1993, BMW registered a 
profit of roughly DM510 million. The Bavarian formula to 
success: Concentration on the automotive business; new markets, 
such as power-unit building, only jointly with a strong partner 
like Rolls-Royce; constantly new model variations--and no 
squabbling on the management level. The result: "In the German 
automotive industry BMW has the most advantageous cost 
structure," according to an analysis of the major Credit 
Lyonnais bank. Next objective: BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder 
intends to reduce development time from seven to three years and 
cut in half the number of 900 direct suppliers within a few 
years. 
  VW boss Ferdinand Piech intends to match BMW and Mercedes. 
Piech is already striking a balance of success. And it is so 
fantastic that some just cannot believe it: Within one year the 
VW AG's break-even point was brought down from a 107-percent to 
85-percent capacity. It is anticipated that as early as the end 
of 1994 the Volkswagen make will realize profits. After all, in 
1993 the VW AG has managed a thin profit of about DM70 million. 
  VW was able to save more than DM6 billion in 1993 alone, 
train employees for lean production, and escalate productivity 
in the plants by 25 percent within 12 months. Commentary by the 
Deutsche Bank Research: "The 1994 VW will be out of the woods." 
  However, Piech lowered capital expenditures in 1993 by 
almost 
a half down to DM5 billion. Piech's calculation: All across the 
board, he plans to build cars after the module principle so that 
for the entire group only four underbodies are required instead 
of the present 16. 
  The Czech subsidiary Skoda is presently already operating 
more cost-efficiently than the Japanese. Even the managers from 
the group's central headquarters are actively taking part in the 
savings: Like the rest of the VW workforce, their salary is 
reduced by one-fifth and consequently they have to work--at 
least unofficially 20 percent less. With the introduction of the 
29-hour week, Volkswagen is able to avoid 30,000 dismissals. 
Nevertheless, the group must show a loss in the first quarter of 
1994 the same as in the previous year. But "it will be 
substantially lower," states an employee from the executive 
circle. 
  Red figures remain the current color in Porsche's statement 
so far. But Wendelin Wiedeking, at the helm at Porsche, is 
working doggedly for a turnaround: Within five years almost 
every fifth job has been eliminated. By 1995, Wiedeking plans to 
reduce production times by one-third, and the number of 
contractors from 950 to 300 by 1997. 
  Wiedeking has a firm hold on things. Porsche marketing, for 
years the company's weak point, will from now on work again 
right next door with the Porsche board in 
Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. The new "Boxster," on which they set 
their hopes, is slated to be ready for the market in less than 
four years. 
  Full of pride, the young boss in Zuffenhausen pronounces: 
"We 
have left the low point behind us." Even in the first semester 
of 1994 Porsche will earn money again for the first time in the 
automotive business. In the United States the new Porsche is 
being ordered "sight unseen." "We have not seen anything like it 
in five years," an executive from the sales department rejoices. 
Walter Gnauert, director of finance: "We have worked off half of 
our competitive disadvantage to Japan." 
  The Japanese art of the autobus represents a shining example 
even for General Motors subsidiary Opel. All of the 14 European 
GM factories are supposed to learn from the new plant in 
Eisenach. Initial successes are becoming apparent. The cost 
disadvantage to the English GM plants for the assembly of the 
Vectra was cut in half to DM450 within two years. The new Corsa 
requires a quarter fewer individual parts than its predecessor; 
for the new Omega the number is reduced to 40 percent. In 1992 
it took 30 hours to assemble the Omega; the goal is for 20 hours 
to be sufficient by 1995, a value not even reached 
internationally by all of the compact carmakers. 
  In addition, Opel boss David Herman banks on a new company 
agreement which limits future wage increases to 2 percent 
annually. Also, during the change of shifts the assembly line 
continues to move, and the workers do not punch the timeclock 
until they are on the job in their overalls. The Christmas bonus 
has been eliminated, the number of employees dropped by 9 
percent, and even the number of sick persons has decreased by 
one-tenth to below 7 percent. For Opel this means a savings of 
roughly DM1 billion in four years. The employees are now to 
benefit from this as well: For achieving the self-determined 
savings objectives, Opel plans to distribute a so-called 
structural bonus in March--almost one-third of a monthly wage 
after all. 
  At Ford, on the other hand, the employees are being 
motivated 
with "Knecht Ruprecht" [Santa Claus' attendant] switches behind 
the windshield of their own vehicle. One employee from Cologne: 
"A subtle hint to colleagues who do not come to work in a Ford." 
There was a time during the eighties when the Cologne Ford 
plants were considered the best managed enterprise of the German 
automotive industry. No longer. The new Ford director Albert 
Caspers: "We are in the midst of a struggle for survival." 
  By 1996 Caspers plans to launch the DM12-billion capital 
expenditures program at Ford--making it the largest in the 
company history. The production time of 2.3 hours for the new 
Zetec engine has already reached Japanese levels in the Cologne 
engine plant; in the Belgian Genk factory the Mondeo is being 
built with a profit at a capacity of only 65 percent. But this 
does not solve Ford's main problem: The make continues to 
represent the German pedestrian citizen--reliable and 
respectable, but dull. 
  Nevertheless, Ford boss Caspers is optimistic about 
achieving 
his ambitious goals: "We shall be among the winners." But that's 
what everyone in the industry wants. VW boss Piech, who would 
like nothing better than to become the headman of the industry, 
knows exactly why: "Whoever emerges first from the crisis has 
the best chances."

<F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker article: "`The Debate Is One That </F>
Should First Be Conducted in Qualitative Terms and Only 
Secondarily in Quantitative Terms'"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- The new Federal Government white paper, 
entitled "The Security of the Federal Republic of Germany and 
the Current Position and Future of the Bundeswehr," is to be 
published on 5 April. In it, the Federal Government sets out 
its security and defense policy, the Bundeswehr's future 
mission, as well as the way in which the armed forces are to 
perform it. The 1994 white paper thus fulfills an important 
task, because the interested citizen has had to wait nine years 
for an assessment of German security and defense policy, which 
has been prompted by the dramatic changes in world politics. 
The very way in which the Bundeswehr and the Western alliance 
has reacted to the changes that have occurred until now is 
significant -- it is the only way in which the role of armed 
forces can be appreciated in a difficult political situation. 
The white paper provides no patent recipes for the future; what 
it does contain are parameters for a historically necessary 
discussion about the tasks and functions of the armed forces of 
a united Germany as the strongest power in Central Europe. The 
debate is one that should first of all be conducted in 
qualitative terms and only secondarily in quantitative terms. 
  The WELT AM SONNTAG has listed the main points of the white 
paper as follows: 
  1. The introductory chapter "German Unity and the 
Bundeswehr" describes the underlying factors and point of 
departure for the 1989 European revolution: The collapse of 
communism in Europe and of the Iron Curtain, the dissolution of 
the Warsaw Pact and ultimately the fall of the Soviet Union. 
  2. The chapter entitled "The Situation" states the 
following: 
  Germany achieved unity with the approval of all its 
neighbors 
and the world powers and now has complete sovereignty. It is 
now surrounded solely by democratic states, friends, and 
partners. 
  However, the European landscape still represents a 
contradictory picture. Advanced integration processes contrast 
with centrifugal tendencies and tendencies toward the 
fragmentation of state units in the eastern and southeastern 
parts of the continent. 
  Now, it is important to take steps to eliminate new risks, 
which are qualitatively of an entirely different kind from the 
risk that rightly determined Western security thinking in the 
past. The risk of a large-scale war throughout Europe has been 
replaced by an entire variety of risk factors that differ 
greatly regionally. Overall, there has been an increase in the 
number of unstable regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The 
readiness to resort to military means is increasing everywhere. 
  Military conflicts, which could endanger Germany's 
existence, 
have become improbable as long as Germany, in alliance with 
NATO, can maintain its ability to defend itself. In the future 
strategic context, military risks will only be a part of a broad 
spectrum of security policy considerations. Risk analyses of 
future developments must proceed from a concept of security. 
They cannot be limited to Europe, but must take into account 
the interdependence of regional and global developments. They 
must consider social, economic, and ecological trends and their 
relation to the security of Germany and its allies. 
  The prevention of conflicts and the resolution of conflicts 
in a broader geographical context with a legitimate mandate 
under international law must be in the forefront of concerns 
about security. Within the framework of a cause-based policy 
for the solution of crises and conflicts, the use of military 
means may also be necessary to prevent, limit, or end violence 
or war. 
  3. The chapter "The Concept of German Security and Defense 
Policy" states: 
  Concrete security policy action is based on interests. 
German 
security policy has to take into account political constant 
factors and long-term framework conditions: Germany's 
geographical position in the center of Europe, its economic 
position as an exporting nation, close links with the world 
economy, and, finally, the experiences of German and European 
history. 
  German foreign and security policy is guided by five key 
interests: 
  -- Safeguarding the freedom, security, and well-being of 
Germany's citizens and the inviolability of its territory; 
  -- Integration with the European democracies within the 
European Union [EU], because democracy, the rule of law state, 
and well-being outside Germany's borders also means security and 
freedom for Germany; 
  -- The enduring alliance with the United States as a world 
power, which is based on common values and similar interests, 
with the potential of the United States being indispensable for 
international stability; 
  -- The admission of our Eastern neighbors to Western 
structures in a manner that is geared toward equality and 
partnership; 
  -- Worldwide respect for international law and human rights 
and a worldwide economic order based on free market rules. 
  4. The chapter "Areas for Action for German Security Policy" 
describes the international institutions in which Germany 
participates: 
  Germany is a member of the United Nations; a participant in 
the CSCE; and a member of NATO, the EU, and the WEU [Western 
European Union]. These institutions should supplement an 
efficient security order in Europe and for Europe. 
  NATO's main task remains contributing to a lasting and just 
peaceful order in Europe in conjunction with other institutions. 
  The January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels sets a decisive 
course in that respect. It provide answers on three key points: 
  -- The ability to exercise collective defense, which is the 
cornerstone of European security. Alliance defense remains the 
core function. However, it is unlikely that NATO will have to 
defend itself. On the other hand, the numerous crises and 
limited conflicts in Europe and on the edge of Europe, on the 
other side of the alliance's borders, are real. That requires 
that NATO should be able to participate in the international 
resolution of crises. 
  -- The reform of NATO and European integration processes are 
now closely linked to one another. The WEU will be strengthened 
as the European pillar of the alliance. In the future, it will 
be able to seek recourse to NATO structures and forces. Thus, 
Europe will be in a position to act strategically, and, at the 
same time, dual structures will be avoided. That will relieve 
some of the burden on the United States and will, at the same 
time, create conditions for a lasting U.S. commitment in and for 
Europe. 
  -- NATO has made the stabilization of Central, southeastern, 
and East Europe a joint task of the first order. With the 
Partnership for Peace initiative, the alliance has made an offer 
of greater cooperation in peace missions under UN and CSCE 
mandates to our neighbors in the East. 
  The Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step on 
the road to introducing new partners into Western security 
institutions. It is no substitute for opening up the alliance. 
  In a transitional period in particular it is important to 
take into account the interests of all. This means that the 
alliance must pursue cooperation with Russia just as intensively 
as its preparations for the integration of new members. 
  The Maastricht Treaty of 7 February 1992 sets out 
perspectives under international law for European political 
union, which is based on and shaped by shared values and 
principles. It entails a joint European foreign and security 
policy. 
  The CSCE is being developed into an operational instrument 
for the prevention of conflicts and resolution of crises. 
  By joining the United Nations in 1973, Germany has 
recognized 
the rights and duties that that entails without reservation. 
  To meet our increased responsibility, the United Nations 
also 
requires the support of regional organizations and alliances. 
In Europe, NATO and WEU are partners of the United Nations and 
the CSCE. The German contribution to safeguarding peace will in 
the future be primarily political and economic, not military. 
With respect to the deployment of military forces, Germany will 
only act in conjunction with allies and partners within the 
framework of a UN mission. 
<H3>  On the Current Position and Future Development of the 
Bundeswehr </H3>
  Chapter 5. "The Bundeswehr of the Future" 
  National and alliance defense in a markedly better security 
situation, especially in Central Europe, and the increased 
significance of effective and preventative crisis management are 
the new points of departure for determining military 
capabilities and their qualitative and quantitative form. The 
Bundeswehr now has a different spectrum of tasks; it is broader, 
more diverse, and more graduated than under the one dimensional 
threat of the period of East-West confrontation. 
  It is of key importance that Germany should possess adequate 
forces for national and alliance defense that can be brought up 
to strength and will thus be able to provide forces that are 
immediately available for alliance crisis management and 
international peace and humanitarian missions. 
  The Bundeswehr's task gives concrete form to these two main 
functions. The Bundeswehr: 
  -- defends Germany and its citizens from political blackmail 
and external danger; 
  -- promotes the military stability and integration of 
Europe; 
  -- serves world peace and international security in line 
with 
the UN Charter: 
  -- helps in the case of catastrophes and emergency 
situations 
and supports humanitarian operations. 
  The Bundeswehr is and remains a conscript army. Universal 
military service is part of the approach to defense that has 
developed in Germany over decades. It stands for the readiness 
of citizens to assume personal responsibility for the protection 
of their state. It guarantees the ability to mobilize by 
drawing on reservists. 
  The structure of the Bundeswehr will be adjusted to suit 
changed security policy framework conditions and to fall into 
line with the capacities that are required. The armed forces 
are divided into three categories: 
  -- crisis reaction forces that are on alert; 
  -- the extensive main defense forces, which are subject to 
mobilization; 
  -- the basic military organization of the armed forces, 
which 
serve the function of the core of the armed forces. 
  The requirements and possibilities of defense and responding 
to crises will in the future lead to a marked graduation of 
armed forces readiness that will correspond to the Bundeswehr's 
task. 
  National defense capability will be consistently directed 
toward improving Germany's security position. The strategic 
situation permits a clear reduction in the armed forces for 
national defense. 
  However, in view of Germany's geostrategic position, making 
a 
special contribution to the level of forces that can be 
mobilized in Central Europe will have a bearing on Germany's 
influence in alliance decisionmaking processes. The ability to 
mobilize on the part of the main armed forces is a decisive 
element in national defense and for Germany's importance in 
NATO's central task, collective defense. 
  The Bundeswehr is by and large adequately equipped for 
national defense. What is still lacking is the ability to 
participate effectively in international crisis management. 
  What is necessary is a German contingent that will be part 
of 
crisis response forces, a contingent that is in a position to 
conduct operations together with alliance partners and thus 
cover the entire range of possible missions. 
  The formation of the contingent should be such that Germany 
is able to meet its obligations with respect to NATO and the 
WEU. It must be in a position to operate within the framework 
of NATO and the WEU as well as to cooperate effectively with 
partners under the auspices of the United Nations. In addition, 
it must be versatile, flexible, durable in order to fulfill the 
entire spectrum of tasks in crisis management, UN peace 
missions, and humanitarian missions in various deployment 
regions. 
  The adjustments that have to be made to the Bundeswehr are 
based on the need to effectively develop the basic ability to 
resolve crisis, to implement the principle of universal military 
service sensibly, and obtain planning security in view of scarce 
resources. This means that the Bundeswehr will continue to 
rationalize in a consistent manner. 
  Intelligence gathering, extensive mobility for the 
deployment 
and supply of military contingents, sea and air transportation, 
general supply and communications capabilities, and effective 
air defense are of key importance for future defense planning. 
  The future size of crisis response forces, the more 
pronounced differentiation of the main defense forces, 
operational rationalization and the streamlining of structures 
will open up options for the future internal structure of the 
armed forces, personnel levels, and the stationing of personnel. 
  Chapter 6. "The Bundeswehr in Transition" describes the 
current position of the army, air force, and navy, central 
Medical Corps offices, as well as central Bundeswehr offices and 
their specific contributions to the main tasks of the Bundeswehr. 
  Chapter 7. The final chapter describes the role and 
self-perception of the "Bundeswehr in the State and Society." 
  The transformations in security policy also have 
psychological and moral implications for military 
self-perception. The scope of this self-perception is being 
expanded. The active promotion of peace has now been added to 
the prevention of war. The soldier remains the defender of 
freedom and peace. He must be able to fight and when necessary, 
risk his life for the protection of Germany and for others 
within the framework of international obligations. That is the 
ethical core of military service and remains unchanged. 
  However, today the focus is no longer on defense against a 
direct threat. Today the question is also one of helping people 
and peoples in need and danger, reconstructing states that have 
been destroyed, and keeping those who disrupt peace in check. 
  As far as training is concerned, only forces that are ready 
for action can satisfy requirements and survive the extreme 
burdens imposed on them. These criteria determine the form, 
extent, and intensity of training in the armed forces.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fritz Wirth: "Trying To Win Time"] </F>
  [Text] Toughness and determination have so far not been the 
hallmark of U.S. policy under Bill Clinton. He had to pay a 
high price for his hesitant attitude toward Bosnia, Somalia, and 
Haiti. The credibility and predictability of U.S. foreign 
policy have been damaged. 
  All the conflicts mentioned, however, pale before the 
exacerbating crisis surrounding North Korea. North Korea is an 
isolated and desperate country whose regime is capable of 
incomprehensible actions. It is trying to blackmail the whole 
world with its nuclear facilities. The big question is: Are 
patience and diplomacy suitable weapons to respond to this 
provocation or is it time to reply with the same toughness to 
this blackmail, as shown by George Bush in the Gulf war against 
Saddam Husayn? 
  It is certain that the policy of cautious patience that has 
been adopted so far is no longer sufficient. Slow-motion 
reactions are not appropriate for a regime that is trying to 
gain time because time gives birth to tough nuclear realities in 
this conflict. CIA leader Woolsey proved this recently by 
pointing out that, in all likelihood, North Korea possesses the 
first nuclear weapon. 
  Everything suggests that Clinton will continue to seek a 
diplomatic solution, enriched with gestures of a military threat 
and economic sanctions. For the time being, he rules out a 
military confrontation. It may well be that the time for 
toughness -- as adopted toward Saddam Husayn at the time -- has 
not yet come. However, if Washington wants to exert diplomatic 
pressure, this can only take place with the willing cooperation 
of the most important partner in this conflict -- that is China. 
Thus, it is all the more incomprehensible that Clinton risked 
direct confrontation with Beijing in his policy toward China. 
Diplomacy may still be the most important weapon in relations 
with North Korea but only so long as one does not use it to 
shoot oneself in the foot.

<F P=106> [Jutta Lietsch commentary: "Empty Threats"] </F>
  [Text] In contrast to Pakistan and India, North Korea 
acceded to the Nonproliferation Treaty. Like the two Southeast 
Asian states, North Korea is suspected of developing nuclear 
weapons of its own -- or at least of being able to. Pyongyang 
denies this, but it permits inspectors of the Vienna 
International Atomic Energy Agency to enter the country and 
obstructs them in the fulfillment of their tasks. The 
governments of Pakistan and India do not even permit such 
checks. However, they are at least more predictable than the 
government of North Korea. 
  Nobody -- not even the South Korean, Japanese, or U.S. 
agents 
who have worn themselves out with the Northeast Asian country 
for years -- can really say who is pulling what strings in the 
regime of aging great leader Kim Il-song and his son Kim 
Chong-il. The nuclear inspectors from Vienna were only able to 
state that it cannot be ruled out that North Korea is working on 
nuclear arms. The intelligence services claim that the country 
also has or is developing booster rockets. It is known that the 
isolated country with a seriously damaged economy gets oil and 
foodstuffs from China and exchanges arms for oil with Iran. 
  None of that is new and it does not amount to a current 
crisis. What is new is that Bill Clinton's administration has 
now "lost patience," and that it is now believed in Washington 
that one has to defend the credibility of U.S. foreign policies, 
whose declared aim is to free the world from the nuclear threat. 
Let us assume that it is not a diversion, and that the Clinton 
Administration is not looking, in a reflex action, for a chance 
to divert the public's attention from domestic policy problems 
-- Whitewater -- while, at the same time, repairing the foreign 
policy mistake in China. Let us also assume that not only the 
pacification of the officers in the Pentagon and the U.S. 
armament industry, who find it difficult to get rid of their 
Patriot missiles elsewhere, is at issue. What threats can be 
used against a regime like that of North Korea? An economic 
embargo? That is to say, that the Korean community in Japan 
must not send any money and goods to North Korea? That Iraq, 
Iran, or China must not deliver any more oil? What is the use 
of threats that cannot be translated into reality? Whatever 
induced the U.S. Administration to advocate sanctions, the 
result will not reduce the danger in the region. What is more, 
it must be feared that the forces in the north and south of the 
Korean peninsula who tend to be prepared for dialogue will be 
silenced and that the hardliners on both sides will win. Then 
there might really be a crisis.

  [Text] Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard gathered this morning at the Elysee to discuss 
the situation in Algeria, where two French nationals were killed 
last night. 
  Shortly afterward, the French Foreign Ministry advised those 
French nationals whose presence is not vital in Algeria to leave 
the country. Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque spoke to 
Frederic Barrere: 
  [Begin Duque recording] France condemns the cowardly killing 
of two of its nationals in Algeria--Mr. Roger Drouaier and his 
son Pascal. It denounces this act of barbarity, which marks a 
new phase in violence, thus threatening the presence of 
foreigners on Algerian territory. In this context, it is 
advisable for our nationals whose presence is not vital to take 
the necessary steps to return to France. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.-F.R.": "When Mitterrand Fans the Flames"] </F>
  [Text] The hazards of timing would be worrying if we did 
not know that the president of the Republic is a past master in 
the art of adapting to them. It was just as Employment Minister 
Michel Giraud was beginning to receive the trade unions to 
explain to them the virtues of the vocational training contracts 
[CIP] (or at least what remains of them) that Francois 
Mitterrand emphatically returned to his favorite theme, the 
protection of social achievements. His aim was probably mainly 
to go back over the recent G-7 meeting devoted to employment. 
"I and others in France have worked very hard to ensure that 
the big countries deal with the actual problems of their fellow 
citizens," he stressed. 
<H5>  Defender of the Welfare State </H5>
  "That has been made possible because a few big countries are 
no longer advocating wage cuts or questioning social protection 
as a remedy for unemployment, although many countries still are 
tempted to do so." 
  A temptation for whom? At all events, it is impossible not 
to see a relationship between the head of state's remarks and 
the slogans hostile to the vocational training contracts which 
are resounding in most of France's cities. Of course, Francois 
Mitterrand, despite the Socialists' defeats, "clings" to the 
image he intends to leave to posterity -- that of the defender 
of the weak and oppressed. His statements probably differ 
little, at least on this point, from those made at the G-7 
meeting by Bill Clinton, one of whose avowed objectives is to 
prepare for the future by allowing wage earners to "gain higher 
qualifications and wages." On this point alone, because by 
stating, some 20 days before the signing of the GATT agreements 
in Marrakesh, that "there will only be lasting progress when 
social clauses are included in international agreements," the 
French president, even with the best intentions--who can 
decently approve of the shameless exploitation of child labor or 
political prisoners?--is nonetheless invoking the virtues of 
protectionism to eliminate relocations which destroy jobs. 
  After having worked for a more open European single market, 
after having started the privatization of government companies, 
and after having allowed the power of the trade unions to 
decline, the president of the republic has stood out for one 
year now as the defender of the welfare state, which is being 
undermined by the increase in world trade, the decentralization 
of capitalism, and the recession. By fanning the funeral pyre 
of a vocational training scheme doomed before it was born, what 
could he hope to gain from the 750,000 young people without 
jobs? Probably their support...

  [Text] Annecy, France, March 23 (AFP) -- France has 
deported three Turkish Kurds after refusing them political 
asylum, local authorities in Annecy said Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Vural Seker, 22, Iman Seker and Semsettin Yildirim, 31, who 
entered France in 1989, were arrested on Monday when they 
reported to the local police station after the Interior Ministry 
rejected their asylum request. They were put on a plane for 
Istanbul on Tuesday. 
  The committee for the right of aslyum in Annecy condemned 
the 
deportations as "a veritable denial of human rights" and said 
the Kurds had been imprisoned and persecuted in Turkey. 
  But local authority spokeswoman Patricia Mauroy-Willaert 
defended the decision, saying the Kurds were "potential illegal 
immigrants" and that if they had been informed of the decision 
in advance they would have disappeared. 
  The Kurds' initial asylum request had been rejected and the 
refusal was confirmed on appeal.

  [Text] Paris, March 23 (AFP) -- Striking students overran 
the tracks at a mainline station here Wednesday [23 March], 
blocking high-speed trains and suburban services. 
  Students protesting a government scheme to allow firms to 
pay 
less than the legal minimum wage to young people also occupied 
the railway station at Calais, northern France, for three hours, 
causing serious disruption. 
  In Lyon, eastern France, scene of violent demonstrations 
Monday and Tuesday, riot police used water cannon and fired tear 
gas to disperse a group of about 100 youths and tried to arrest 
another group armed with baseball bats. 
  Lyon students said most of them were holding meetings to 
plan 
for major country-wide demonstrations Friday. 
  In Paris, students in technical universities called a 
one-day 
strike. About 100 youths laid down on the tracks at 
Montparnasse station, holding up high-speed (TGV) trains and 
main-line expresses for two hours. Suburban services came to a 
halt. 
  In Calais, the state railway company SNCF bussed stranded 
passengers to other railway stations. 
  In Caen, Normandy, 1,000 students marched peacefully through 
the town before heading for the capital, where they held up 
trains for 30 minutes. Another group took over a nearby 
motorway tollgate, allowing drivers through against a token 
payment. Demonstrations were also reported at La Rochelle in 
the west and at Reims in the northeast. 
  Students are demanding complete withdrawal of the 
government's pay cut plan. 
  In its latest form, the plan states that young people with 
diplomas or university degrees may be paid 80 percent of an 
ordinary salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent 
of training. 
  Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths 
be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs 
(1,000 dollars) a month. Now only unqualified youths may be 
paid less than the minimum. 
  Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study 
and 
trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older 
workers and replacing them with poorly paid youths. 
  France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of 
the 
work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Italian </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, by Alberto Leiss in Bologna; date 
not given: "Progressive Forces, the Historic New Factor" -- 
first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Bologna -- The final days of the election campaign 
are threatening to reach white heat. [Forza Italia leader 
Silvio] Berlusconi and Fininvest are issuing a sharp response to 
the rumors of links between the Arcore [Berlusconi's residence] 
group and Mafia business. Organized crime has murdered a priest 
who spoke out against the Camorra. The war of opposing 
manipulations of the many inquiries opened by the judiciary is 
increasing exponentially. This does not seem like the best 
climate for the birth of the long awaited "Second Republic." 
Particularly in commentaries in the major newspapers, there is 
an extraordinary turn against the possibility of a 
"bipolarization" of the political system, so enthusiastically 
supported throughout the referendum campaign. There is a 
nostalgic turning of attention back to the "center," but it is 
difficult to observe for long the group comprising Zanone 
[leader of the Italian Liberal Party, PLI], Martinazzoli 
[secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI], and La Malfa 
[leader of the Italian Republican Party, PRI]. We discussed all 
this with Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the 
Left, PDS] during a pause in his two day visit to Bologna, 
before his television debate with Berlusconi, to be broadcast 
this evening on Channel 5. His remarks -- on the eve of an 
election that will in any case be historic -- were connected by 
a thread: the voice of political reason must be allowed to 
speak once more, but it must be a truly new politics. 
  [Leiss] Are we about to witness a violent "reckoning?" In 
connection with the alleged relations between the Mafia and 
Fininvest. Berlusconi denies having reported a "bloodless 
coup." But he and Fedele Confalonieri, the group's chairman, are 
talking in terms of crazy accusations, a campaign of lies, some 
kind of conspiracy. 
  [Occhetto] I do not know who Berlusconi is referring to when 
he talks about a conspiracy in connection with relations between 
the Mafia and his group. What I can say is that he certainly 
cannot be referring to us. In the frank and open broadcast 
telephone discussion that I had with him -- which he himself 
acknowledged was a civilized one -- I did not question the 
judiciary's activities, unlike what his friend, Craxi [former 
Italian Socialist Party secretary], is doing. I am simply 
proceeding from an undeniable fact -- the statement by Mafia 
boss Piromalli, in support of Forza Italia. So there is nothing 
hidden and no "campaign." After all, I also gave him a chance 
to say right away, I reject that. It is not my fault that he 
hesitated, even though the broadcast lasted an hour. 
  [Leiss] But he did say in Palermo: Forza Italia's votes are 
directed against the Mafia. Is that not enough? 
  [Occhetto] I certainly do not want to criminalize all the 
votes that Forza Italia receives. However, that statement is 
too general. Unless it is corroborated by explicit statements 
about government options and measures to really counter the 
Mafia, some scope for ambiguity still remains. 
  [Leiss] The controversy over the role of the judiciary has 
been revived, too. The rumors about charges of Fininvest's 
association with the Mafia started right on cue, the moment 
Berlusconi arrived in Palermo. For that matter, the PDS has not 
been spared in this election campaign, either: Stefanini's 
custody pending trial, Vincenzo Visco's subpoena to appear as a 
witness in the Cusani trial.... 
  [Occhetto] If there is any timing that prompts suspicions, 
the things you mentioned show that it does not affect only one 
side. I would like to add that the matters relating to us are 
connected with events that will certainly be clarified -- at the 
investigation stage, I believe. 
  [Leiss] But has there not been some overprotectiveness on 
the 
part of the Left? This is the charge leveled by some radicals 
who opted to side with the Right. Writing in CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA, Angelo Panebianco said that the judiciary wields too much 
power at present. 
  [Occhetto] If the judiciary seems so strong now, it is 
because the balance has been upset on the political side, as I 
have said many times. The political authorities have shown 
themselves to be greatly compromised. Not only that, but they 
have responded to the inquiries in the worst possible way -- I 
am thinking here about Craxi and also about the arrogant 
behavior of some businessmen. They thought that they could still 
exploit their power to halt a process which was in fact 
unstoppable. And they have created a disaster, causing two 
results -- a profound delegitimization and destabilization of 
politics and excessive attention on the judiciary. Only the 
restoration of the authority of politics can restore the 
disrupted balance. As for us, I remain convinced that we were 
right to support the anticorruption investigations. This, 
because it brought to light the indefensible reality of Bribe 
City. The judiciary's work has been crucial and useful, though 
some judges may have made some mistakes and some initiatives may 
have been taken that are open to criticism with regard to the 
aspect of guarantees and form. 
  [Leiss] Certain mistakes could be irreversible a few days 
away from the elections.... 
  [Occhetto] The judges cannot suspend their inquiries every 
time there is an election. Of course, I hope that in such a 
delicate situation for the country they will be able to 
distinguish between actions, however legitimate, that could 
acquire a propaganda flavor, albeit involuntarily, and actions 
indispensable for the consistent pursuit of their inquiries. 
  [Leiss] One final question on this delicate topic. People 
are talking again -- Judge Davigo, among others, has done so -- 
about the need for a political solution to Bribe City. Is this 
not a crucial element in a government program? 
  [Occhetto] The only real solution is the establishment of a 
new leadership class, an authoritative political system. We are 
opposed to a "whitewash." The new government must provide all 
the instruments and resources that the judiciary needs to ensure 
that trials are held promptly and that clear sentences put an 
end to this very sad chapter in our history. 
  [Leiss] Among the imbalances among the authorities that you 
mentioned, is there not also that caused by the entry into the 
arena of a big businessman owning half Italy's media organs, who 
also has his sights set on the prime ministership? 
  [Occhetto] Undoubtedly. Berlusconi complains that he is 
under attack from lobbies of rivals. But how was it possible 
not to predict that there would be a reaction on the part of 
those who can see a major competitor, who is also a great 
communicator, in the race to gain political power, too? This 
power would enable him to appoint directors to both public and 
private television networks, to back legislation that benefits 
his own vested interests. So much for liberal democracy! It is 
enough to make [French philosopher] Montesquieu, whose principle 
was the separation of authorities, turn in his tomb. 
  [Leiss] Many people now attribute this confusion to the 
illusion of a "bipolar" system. The sharp rivalry between Right 
and Left is a bad thing. The law resulting from the referendums 
is a bad one, and people are turning their attention back to the 
center. 
  [Occhetto] The law is not a good one, and it is the result 
of 
a miscalculation. Those who promoted it -- certainly not we, 
who fought for a two-round system -- thought that the PDS would 
not succeed in forming a broad alliance. Instead, despite 
attempts to exclude Rete and Communist Renewal, we have achieved 
a historic innovation -- the alliance of progressive forces. 
Now people are trying to make the voters believe that it is 
impossible for one alignment to be victorious over the other. 
But it is possible. Difficult, but possible. 
  [Leiss] However, political strategies seem to be focused on 
the assumption that this will not happen. Martinazzoli and 
Amato [Pact for Italy] are dreaming of a coalition government 
comprising the PDS, the PPI, and perhaps the League, excluding 
the "extremes." At his rallies Bossi devotes five minutes to 
criticizing Occhetto and 40 minutes to insulting Berlusconi.... 
  [Occhetto] That seems to me a correct and fair 
proportion.... 
  [Leiss] What about the suggestions emanating from the 
center? 
  [Occhetto] In reply I will cite what Pietro Scoppola and 
other democratic Catholics have said. I am opposed to anything 
that would suspend the process toward a system of rotation, 
however much it may be hindered and obstructed by the mechanisms 
of this electoral law. We must behave clearly within this new 
rationale, law or no law. What if none of the three alignments 
wins? Well, that situation too, if it comes about, must be 
subordinated to the objective of a bipolar system, rejecting the 
temptation to lapse back into the old mentality of alliances. 
  [Leiss] But how? 
  [Occhetto] By talking about policies, not alignments. Even 
within the Popular Party and the "Pact," I remain convinced that 
there is a great difference between the motivations of Segni 
[Pact for Italy leader] and Rosy Bindi [PPI Venice regional 
secretary]. The idea that the center could exploit a possible 
stalemate by winning over part of the Right and part of the Left 
is a new version of the DC's [Christian Democratic Party] old 
"governability" theory. It is disheartening: Why was it 
necessary to hold the referendums and to introduce a 
first-past-the-post system just to achieve this? A continuing 
process of decomposition and recomposition, conducted on the 
basis of policies, would be another matter. With regard to 
matters of substance, there are two poles of attraction, the 
Right and the Left, which must demonstrate their ability to 
attract the center. 
  [Leiss] Is this the same idea as the final destruction of 
the 
center? 
  [Occhetto] I am not talking about destruction. I do not want 
to encourage the "wrecking" of this political area. What I am 
saying is that the further disintegration of the center seems to 
me to be an inevitable process. I know that a proper exchange 
of views on policies will require absolute honesty among the 
progressive forces, too, but this will be an obligation for the 
others, too. Including the right-wing forces. Only thus, if we 
want to continue the renewal, can we consistently fulfil the 
citizens' wishes as expressed through their votes, if they do 
not adequately identify a government majority. But I stress: 
We must now work for the victory of a progressive majority. 
  [Leiss] Do you rule out an agreement on matters of policy 
with the League? For instance, on the subject of federalism? 
  [Occhetto] Frankly, I do not see on the basis of what 
policies such an agreement could be built. Its shameful 
criticism of the concept of solidarity, especially of solidarity 
between the north and south of the country, is too great a 
negative factor for us. This, partly because it symbolizes a 
whole vision of society. What kind of credibility could such an 
alliance enjoy? If the League were really able to free its 
federalist aspirations from their demagogic and separatist 
encumbrances, then cooperation could prove possible in this 
field in parliament. 
  [Leiss] The election campaign is reaching its conclusion. 
What aspect of it has struck you most forcibly? 
  [Occhetto] I would say, the international attention on us. 
The other evening in Naples, in that festive atmosphere, I 
thought that because of the television news strike, I would not 
be surrounded by television cameras, as usual. In fact all the 
world's major television stations were there, starting with CNN. 
I answered dozens of questions, which confidently took for 
granted our victory, a government role for us. Nobody now, 
except Berlusconi, is brandishing the bugaboo of "communism" any 
more. And I was struck by something that Michel Rocard [French 
Socialist Party secretary general] said in Genoa: "The whole of 
Europe is watching you, and it would be crazy if there were a 
victory for an unnatural government comprising the DC right, the 
separatists of the League, and the neofascists of the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]." Is the fact that at our rallies so 
much support has been shown for such people as Rocard, Glotz, 
and the European group leader, Jean-Pierre Cot, not a sign that 
the Italian Left really has embarked on a new chapter of its 
history, no longer marked by the split between communists and 
socialists? 
  [Leiss] The main event in this election campaign seems to be 
the television debate between Occhetto and Berlusconi. Marcello 
Flores has suggested that in the republic's new phase political 
leaders appear on television no more than once every three 
months. Do you agree with that? 
  [Occhetto] There is indeed something wrong in the 
relationship between politics and television. I am not 
convinced by the rules dictated by the watchdog committee. 
After all, the forum of the political platform through which a 
political leader can be questioned, calmly but closely, by 
well-informed journalists is not so bad. In the discussions 
involving several people, which are now the fashion, things are 
not always clear. Facile quips prevail amid an atmosphere 
rather more suited to a football match. It is exciting for the 
fans of each side, but perhaps there is a broader public that 
does not understand much of it and does not find it exciting. 
Furthermore, the rivalry between the networks and the 
superimposition of so many platforms has caused a kind of tower 
of Babel. Flores' remark was excessive, a provocation. But it 
is a move in the right direction. The direction of rules, 
quality, selection. Not a television free-for-all. 
  [Leiss] Even some of Fininvest's television presenters have 
entered the arena.... 
  [Occhetto] That seems to me dangerous and unprecedented. In 
such instances there should be prompt and strict action by the 
monitoring authorities. 
  [Leiss] Are you worried about your "match" with Berlusconi? 
  [Occhetto] I read that he would have preferred to meet with 
[PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, because he likes me as a person. 
What is he doing -- counterattacking by flattering me? He might 
succeed....

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Passalacqua: "Maroni: `Yes, Forza Italia </F>
Asked Me To Betray'"] 
  [Text] Varese -- The war between [League Secretary Umberto] 
Bossi and [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi is still 
raging. Last Monday afternoon [21 March], in Turin, the 
League's leader was bombarded with telephone calls from 
Berlusconi, who was trying to soften his positions, but Bossi 
steered full steam ahead. Yesterday, in Novara, he said: "We 
have nothing in common with Berlusconi." In his TV appeal to 
voters, which had just been recorded, he made no concessions. 
His ideas are clear-cut: "There are those who do not want to 
change anything, namely the Left; those who want to change 
something, namely Forza Italia; and those who want to carry out 
a revolution, namely the League." In short, nothing has changed 
between the two halfhearted allies. To complicate matters even 
more, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has been courting the 
bandwagon's [League nickname] colonels -- first and foremost 
Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader]. 
  Maroni, have you received any offers from Forza Italia to 
change sides? "No explicit offers," Maroni replied. Bossi's 
"adopted son" (the nickname was coined by Bossi himself), who is 
also the League's number two, did not pull back, did not hide 
behind words or deny the allegations. No explicit advances were 
made, but advances were made at any rate. Maroni explained: 
"Suggestions were made. However, it was not Berlusconi who made 
them, but other people." And what did you reply? The League's 
"Doctor Subtle," who is notoriously a staunch Milan soccer team 
supporter, answered in jest: "Tell the Knight that, given that I 
am supporter of the Devil [Milan soccer team nickname], I will 
join him only if he obtains for me the number 10 jersey in the 
Milan team, the one worn by Savicevic. I would be happy to play 
at San Siro [stadium] just for 10 minutes." Maroni laughed and, 
in response to a journalist who cast doubts on the truthfulness 
of this reply to Berlusconi's overtures, he said: "This is 
exactly what I said. Why, do you find it unbelievable?" 
  In short, feelers and offers have been put forward, and 
these 
were addressed not only to Maroni and [League's Milan Mayor] 
Formentini, but to many others too. Maroni then went on to 
repeat the recent jibe about Berlusconi's candidacy for the 
premiership: "If he fails to get elected in Rome, standing 
against such a nonentity as [Budget Minister] Spaventa, he will 
have to give up becoming prime minister." 
  For weeks, League outgoing deputies and high-ranking 
officials have been bombarded with phone calls and even faxes 
inviting them to leave the Bandwagon and rally to Berlusconi's 
tricolor symbol. This has been a large-scale recruiting 
campaign, aimed at weakening the League and transforming it into 
a submissive spare tire of Berlusconi's project. This explains 
Bossi's campaign against Berlusconi, including the circulars, 
signed by the Bandwagon's leader, against conducting a common 
electoral campaign with Forza Italia. Maroni calmly explained: 
"A recruiting campaign? Of course. An avalanche of faxes. 
But those who received them, or who were made an offer, 
immediately reported them to us. This is how the League's 
supporters are -- in politics they follow their hearts, they are 
not interested in personal profit." 
  Maroni was not unduly upset, he almost took for granted that 
the League's ally would wage this kind of offensive. "It is 
only natural. Berlusconi regards the League as one of his 
businesses, one among many. However, the League is a political 
movement which was built by its activists with their blood and 
tears. Within a company, officials can be turncoats, they can 
be bought, it is enough to offer them more, and they can also be 
fired on the spot. However, the League is not a company. We are 
not managers, we are political leaders who believe in 
federalism. Berlusconi's men are exclusively rational, 
calculating. We are emotive, personally committed. They 
believe the League's supporters can easily be won over by making 
rational offers, but we are not at all like this." 
  What about those who have already changed sides, those who 
have joined National Alliance [AN]? Maroni gave a prompt reply: 
"Any party can be infiltrated by agents, but, you see, as far 
as they are concerned, no recruiting campaign was necessary. 
They were all ready to leave anyway." 
  Senate floor leader Enrico Speroni, speaking from Rome, made 
the same point, though his tone was somewhat different: 
"Opportunists and venomous snakes are well advised to leave," 
he said, commenting on the departure of a number of former 
deputies, town councilors, and party officials, who followed 
Fini's [secretary of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] call. 
Speroni also had some cutting remarks in store for Senator 
Gianfranco Miglio, the independent League supporter and 
theoretician of a bandwagon moving steadily toward secession. 
In fact, in a recent interview Miglio was self-critical: "The 
alliance with Berlusconi was a mistake. I was in favor of it, 
but today I must recognize that it would have been better to go 
into the elections on our own." However, arguing against 
professor Miglio, who believes that many former League 
supporters will vote tomorrow for National Alliance, Speroni 
said: "Those who chose the League did so because they believe 
in federalism. Therefore they can join anybody they like, but 
certainly not the statist and centralist MSI. These guys really 
understand nothing at all." 
  For his part Maroni, addressing AN, made a mock overture: 
"If Fini accepts federalism, then we can talk, but in order to 
do so he will have to disown 40 years of his past, and all the 
days spent on his electoral campaign, his speeches, and his 
statements."

<F P=106> [Article by Angelo Lupoli: "16 Trillion Lire Gap in the </F>
Accounts"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The accounts are now ready, but it will be 
up to Prime Minister Ciampi to decide when to publish the 
quarterly budget report. Between today and tomorrow, once the 
examination of the general state accountant's work is completed, 
the prime minister will release the "prognoses," making known, 
almost certainly prior to Sunday's [27 March] vote, the state of 
health of the government budget. Figures for the first three 
months are good, but the results will once again be weighed down 
by the recession, which will contribute decisively to the almost 
15 trillion lire deviation from forecasts already ascertained 
following the past few days' indiscrete leaks. This means that 
the deficit, by the end of the year, should amount to around 160 
trillion lire. 
  The document put together by General State Accountant Andrea 
Monorchio's men can be summarized in a few figures: receipts 
will be 10 trillion lire below forecast, more than half of this 
due to lower tax receipts (personal income tax, VAT [value-added 
tax], municipal real estate tax). Additionally, the state will 
be spending some 6 trillion lire more than originally estimated. 
This figure is made up of greater expenditures, mainly 
transfers for social security and assistance. Included in the 
expenditures, however, are both a reduction in interest paid to 
holders of government securities (approximately 3 trillion lire) 
and a drop in investments, which by the end of the year will be 
less than initially calculated by the government. Personnel 
expenditure, on the other hand, should be in line with forecasts. 
  The expenditure savings to be achieved during 1994 include 
those relating to supplies to public authorities. The "Cassese 
package," that is the measures devised by the civil service 
minister aimed in particular at rationalizing the public 
procurement of goods and services, makes provision for a savings 
of 2.9 trillion lire. The first data available on the 
government budget contradict the indiscretions which labeled 
these measures to be ineffective. In fact, in the first two and 
a half months of 1994, despite a larger budget allocation, 
procurement expenditure fell 6.5 percent compared with the same 
period in 1993. Payments too have reduced by 4.7 percent. In 
substance, the Cassese package is beginning to produce the 
expected effects. 
  The ending of the pubic auditor's work provides 
clarification 
on the public accounts, about which all sorts of rumors and 
figures have been whirling round in recent days. 
  It was a genuine war in which the most disparate suggestions 
have been made. Initially it was rumored that Cassese's 
measures had not provided the expected results. This 
indiscretion, however, proved to be unfounded. 
  Following this, a table was circulated, purported to come 
from the general state accountant, which while confirming the 16 
trillion lire deficit, announced a heavy fall in tax receipts. 
It even suggested a figure of 13 trillion lire below forecast, 
with a substantial VAT shortfall, a figure which immediately 
brought down a storm of fury on the head of Finance Minister 
Franco Gallo. At the ministry they quickly pointed out that 
this figure was unfounded, and that the Finance Ministry's 
estimates were much lower: 4-5 trillion lire less revenue, 6 
trillion lire on a worst-case basis. 
  The same mysterious table "gave the figures" on other 
headings. For example, it mentioned 10 trillion lire lower 
receipts from the sale of goods and services (including those 
planned with the restructuring of the postal system and the sale 
of real estate by the social security agencies), while the 
economic transactions expect to make a net 1,800 billion from 
this income item. 
  There was then forecast an incredible savings of 11 trillion 
lire in personnel expenditure, contrary to the government's 
plans and the accountant's own estimates. 
  This ballet of figures has now been going on for several 
weeks, and is so bizarre that someone has begun to suspect that 
this has to a certain extent been intentional; that there has 
been a desire to dramatize the situation of public finances and 
to place the blame on first one, then another minister. The 
publication of the quarterly budget report should therefore put 
an end to these polemics and more or less guided indiscretions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Public Deficit Soared to 4.4 </F>
Trillion Pesetas -- Twice What Was Forecast -- in 1993"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The public deficit of the public 
administrations as a whole, including autonomous communities and 
local authorities, last year exceeded 4.4 trillion pesetas -- 
over twice what was forecast by the government in the 
convergence plan. This new "hole" in public finances, which 
represents 7.3 percent of GDP, was made known by the Spanish 
Government to the European Commission yesterday. 
  The effects of the economic crisis, lower tax revenues as a 
result of the fall in employment and the reduction of business 
profits, and greater expenditure to cope with a growing number 
of unemployed and the increase in pensioners, largely as a 
result of early retirements, partly explain this situation. 
However, the sharp increase in expenditure to meet the interest 
on and amortization of a public debt which will exceed 33 
trillion pesetas this year, and the transfers to the autonomous 
communities, must not be forgotten. 
  Economy Minister Pedro Solbes himself acknowledged this week 
that the problem of the public deficit has obsessed him since he 
arrived at the ministry in July 1993, and stated that it stood 
at 7.2 percent of GDP last year. This "hole" represents a 
further move away from the Maastricht terms for attaining 
monetary union, which set the maximum public deficit limit at 3 
percent of GDP. 
  According to the figures which the government made known to 
the European Commission, the state is chiefly responsible for 
this imbalance in public accounts. Thus, out of the total 
percentage of the deficit in 1993 (7.3 percent of GDP), the 
central administration accounts for 5.8 percent, the social 
security administrations 0.3 percent, the autonomous communities 
1 percent, and the local authorities 0.2 percent. 
  The trend in the public deficit over the past few years 
makes 
clear a drastic deterioration in 1993, since between 1983 and 
1990 the gap between the public administrations' revenue and 
expenditure ranged between 1 trillion and 2 trillion pesetas. 
In 1991 and 1992 it exceeded 2.6 trillion pesetas, and last 
year the figure soared to 4.4 trillion pesetas. These 
comparative figures also show that that it is the central 
administrations' deficit which has soared highest, rising from 
3.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to 6.1 percent in 1993, while the 
autonomous communities and local authorities keep their debt at 
a similar level to last year's -- 1.2 percent of GDP.

  [Text] Copenhagen, March 23 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic said here Wednesday [23 March] his country 
"is not planning any military operation" against break-away 
Serbs in the Krajina region. 
  On the contrary, he told journalists, Croatia was looking 
forward to reducing troop levels "as long as the Serbs do not 
continue their aggression." 
  The minister said Croatia was ready to grant local autonomy 
to the region but would never accept Krajina's integration into 
Greater Serbia nor a formal link between Krajina Serbs and rebel 
Serbs in Bosnia. 
  Granic partially admitted accusations made by humanitarian 
organisations that Serbs in Krajina had been persecuted and 
their homes destroyed. "We're at war," he said, "and it's 
difficult to control everything that happens near the front 
line." 
  Granic said his country was in favour of international 
supervision to ensure human and minority rights were respected 
in Krajina and said negotiations between Croat and Serb 
representatives from the region would recommence in the Russian 
embassy in Zagreb in six days' time. 
  He also indicated that Croatia was ready to normalize 
relations with Serbia if it ceased to support secessionists in 
Krajina and said it was "necessary to apply even more pressure 
on Belgrade which holds one of the keys to the end of the war in 
ex-Yugoslavia." 
  Granic said he was in favour of a new "active and realistic" 
mandate for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Krajina. He 
said the present mandate had not led to a disarming of the Serbs 
in the region and had not prevented the continued bombardment of 
Croat towns like Zadar. 
  After meeting a number of officials in Copenhagen Wednesday, 
Granic left for Helsinki in the last stage of a Nordic tour that 
also included stops in Oslo and Stockholm.

  [Text] Finland will extend its territorial waters from the 
current four to 12 nautical miles. However, according to a 
decision made by the government at its informal evening meeting 
a little while ago, there will be a passage of at least six 
nautical miles between the territorial waters of Finland and 
Estonia in the Gulf of Finland. Markku Lehto reports: 
  [Lehto] Behind the government's decision in principle to 
extend Finland's territorial waters to 12 nautical miles lies, 
first of all, the need to monitor traffic off the Finnish coast 
more closely than before. Here is what Foreign Minister Heikki 
Haavisto says: 
  [Begin Haavisto recording] Well, I believe that now our 
Frontier Guards establishment, operating under the Interior 
Ministry, will have new kinds of possibilities, because now the 
distance within which we can take measures will increase 
considerably, that is, this will considerably improve Finland's 
security. [end recording] 
  [Lehto] Another reason has been international pressure; our 
neighbors implemented the extension of their territorial waters 
earlier: Estonia extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical 
miles a year ago, and earlier both Russia and Sweden made a 
similar decision. 
  The planned new nautical border for Finland differs from the 
main principle of 12 nautical miles in the Gulf of Finland and 
in (Bogskaer) of the Aaland Islands. A passage of three 
nautical miles of open sea will be reserved from the center 
toward the coast in the Gulf of Finland to meet the needs of 
shipping mainly near St. Petersburg at the end of the Gulf of 
Finland. The Estonians have also left a similar passage for 
Russian shipping, so that traffic to and from St. Petersburg can 
in future use a passage of six nautical miles.

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Korhonen: "Finnish Growth Tops Among </F>
Western Countries"] 
  [Excerpts] Finland's production will increase faster next 
year than in any other Western country. Unemployment will, 
however, remain at peak levels at the same time. 
  On Wednesday [16 February] the Finance Ministry published a 
forecast that claims Finland is climbing out of the recession. 
The recovery is, however, very unevenly distributed: Industrial 
production and exports will continue their vigorous growth, but, 
at the same time, domestic consumer spending will continue to 
decrease while unemployment will increase. 
  "The economy stabilized during last year, and the turn 
toward 
growth is now under way. This does not mean that the recession 
is over, however. The situation in some spheres of the domestic 
markets will get even worse," says Sixten Korkman, director of 
the Finance Ministry's Department of National Economy, as he 
presented the forecast. 
  The price competitiveness of Finnish industry is so good at 
the moment that exports this year are more than one-tenth higher 
than last year. The Finance Ministry is also predicting that 
demand for imports from Finland's most important trade partners 
will begin to rise and that export prices will increase by about 
6 percent. 
  The outward condition of the national economy will improve 
remarkably this year when the balance of trade, which measures 
the difference between currency gains and losses in foreign 
trade, will rise to a surplus as high as 12 billion markkas. 
  Last year, Finland's net foreign debt rose by 37 billion 
markkas, to approximately equal 60 percent of the GNP. According 
to the ministry, this rise was caused primarily by changes in 
currency exchange rates, that is, by the weakening of the markka 
against other currencies. The trade deficit actually increased 
the debt by only 5.5 billion markkas. 
  Now the net foreign debt is shrinking. The ministry is 
predicting a 16-billion-markka surplus in the balance of trade. 
  The Finance Ministry predicts that industrial investments 
will show a marked increase this year. This is explained by the 
fact that firms involved in exports will modernize their 
equipment and establish more production capacity. On domestic 
markets, investments will continue to decrease. 
  Investments by the public sector, that is primarily by the 
state and communities, will still decrease this year, according 
to the Finance Ministry. 
  The weak link in the entire national economy is consumer 
spending, which the Finance Ministry estimates will decrease 2.5 
percent this year. 
  The biggest decrease in consumer spending will be in goods 
and services related to foreign travel. This will decrease by 
more than one-tenth from last year's levels. 
  The Finance Ministry believes that the "change in the 
economic atmosphere" will cause people to cut back on savings 
this year. This will not, however, greatly increase consumer 
spending, since real disposable income for households will 
decrease further by 4 percent due to higher taxes. 
  According to the ministry, "the forecast for most service 
industries is continued difficult times, due to lethargic demand 
and weak profitability." According to the forecast, private 
sector services will still increase by 1 percent. 
All in all, the sum of the values of all produced goods and 
services, the GNP, will increase about 2 percent this year when 
compared to last year. Next year the GNP will increase by 5 
percent, according to the ministry's forecast. [passage omitted] 
  The rise in consumer prices, in other words, inflation, will 
continue to be very low in Finland. 
  Public-sector spending, as compared to the GNP, will 
decrease 
from more than 63 percent to 61 percent. This is partly due to 
the growth in the GNP, and another cause is the cuts in public 
sector spending.

<F P=106> [Article by Hannu Sokala: "Industry's Profitability Rose </F>
With a Roar"] 
  [Text] The profitability and financing conditions in 
industry improved significantly last year. According to the 
Finance Ministry, profitability rose to a level clearly higher 
than the long-term average. This year the profitability of 
industrial enterprises will continue to improve. 
  Last year's improvement in profitability was fostered by the 
rise in prices for export goods, and also by the drop in labor 
unit costs and interest rates. 
  According to preliminary estimates by the ministry, the net 
profits for industrial enterprises rose by 10 billion markkas 
over 1992. Compared to sales, the proportion made up by net 
profits rose by 2.5 percent units to a level of over 8 percent. 
  This year net profits will increase by 11 billion markkas, 
and the share of sales consisting of net profits will increase 
to 10.5 percent. The ministry estimates that the available 
financial resources of industry will rise to 14 percent of sales. 
  Net profits are defined as that portion of money earned by a 
business that can be applied in investments or for distribution 
of income. 
  The financial condition of industry has been improved by the 
fact that companies have been able to decrease their 
indebtedness. The Finance Ministry predicts that the net 
indebtedness of industry, in relation to sales, will decrease to 
about 30 percent by the end of the year, which is on a par with 
predepression levels. 
  The ministry expects that the improvement in financial 
conditions and the lowering of interest rates will drive 
industrial investments into an upswing this year. Conditions for 
investments are now "better than they have been for a long 
time," according to the ministry. 
  The price competitiveness of manufacturers improved about 60 
percent in 1991-93. Two-thirds of this improvement was due to 
the weakening of the markka. The remaining one-third was the 
result of the rapid improvement in productivity, and the 
"patient development" of a better labor cost situation. 
  Competitiveness will drop somewhat this year due to the 
recent strengthening of the markka. Nevertheless, the 
competitiveness of Finnish business will continue to be about 40 
percent better than the long-term average level. 
<H5>  Unemployment Will Continue To Worsen </H5>
  The rapid improvement in conditions for industrial 
enterprise 
will not help decrease unemployment. Sixten Korkman, the head 
director of the Finance Ministry's National Economy Department, 
says that improvement in unemployment is dependent on the 
recovery of the domestic market. 
  "Unemployment will continue to be at shockingly high levels 
for several years because the starting level is so high," said 
Korkman. 
  According to the ministry, the demand for labor will 
continue 
to decrease by more than 30,000 persons yet this year. Jobs will 
be lost especially in service occupations in both the public and 
private sectors. 
  According to the report, the proportion of those unemployed 
who have been out of work for over a year will rise to one-third. 
  According to head director Korkman, employment might still 
improve faster in this situation than in previous recessions, 
because businesses have no employees in "unnecessary positions." 
  "Businesses have eliminated all of the positions that they 
can eliminate. At the same time, productivity has risen 
exceptionally fast during the recession," said Korkman. 
  Labor productivity, that is the ratio of production to the 
work input, rose as much as 12 percent in industry last year, 
which is also the same as during the previous year. The ministry 
expects that industrial productivity will improve by 5.5 percent 
this year.

  [Text] The Swedish Armed Forces judge that Russia is no 
longer a military threat to Sweden. According to a report by 
the Swedish military intelligence and security service, the 
Russian Armed Forces are now in such a weak state that they 
would not be able to attack Sweden. Timo Seppaenen reports from 
Stockholm: 
  [Seppaenen] The Russian bear is sick and weak, says Jan 
Blomquist, the head of the analysis section of the Swedish 
general staff. The same view is shared by the defense forces' 
entire intelligence and security service, which lists a number 
of reasons for its assessment that Russia is militarily 
completely enfeebled. 
  The manpower of the Russian defense forces is now 1.2 
million 
men. The number of people in the war machine is nearly 50 
percent smaller than in the feared Soviet Army. The current 
Russian Army is suffering a considerable staff shortage and it 
is not even capable of managing the training of conscripts 
properly. Russian conscripts are now given only simple basic 
training in guard duties, if one is to believe the Swedish 
experts. 
  Russia's Baltic Fleet is barely a shadow of its former self, 
and because of lack of money it cannot carry out military 
exercises. For that reason, the Russian troops would no longer 
be capable of carrying out a landing. According to Swedish 
experts, the shortage of money has also cut the training of 
Russian pilots so much that air safety is already threatened. 
Russian Air Force pilots clock up from 20 to 40 flying hours a 
year while NATO pilots clock up at least 100 hours, or even over 
150 hours a year. 
  The Swedes are also reassured by the information that 
Russia's arms production has collapsed. In 1988, Russia still 
built 3,500 tanks, last year the figure was only 200. The 
leaders of the Swedish defense forces do remember, however, that 
the Russian Army is still in possession of almost inexhaustible 
arms reserves, where one can even find missiles with nuclear 
warheads. The size of those reserves is not, however, such a 
big deterrent as before, partly because Russia has gone over to 
democracy. According to the Swedish defense forces, as a 
consequence of this, Russia does not have the political will to 
raise the readiness of the country's army to the level required 
for an offensive. 
  Hearing of the assessment by the intelligence and security 
service, Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjork was quick to warn 
that the Swedes should remember that sharpening the claws of the 
Russian bear does not necessarily take very long. Sweden cannot 
lull itself into too strong a sense of security as long as 
politicians like Zhirinovskiy have a chance to rise to power in 
Russia, Bjork said.

<F P=106> [Article by Borje Karlsson: "Bitter Electoral Promises From </F>
the Social Democratic Party: `Sacrifices Are Required To Combat 
Unemployment'"] 
  [Text] It is not with promises of reforms but rather with 
calls for sacrifices that the Social Democrat Party [SDP] is 
going to win this fall's election. Party secretary Mona Sahlin 
is making no secret of that. 
  In a few weeks, she will present an electoral platform, or 
an 
electoral manifesto, to the SDP's executive committee. It will 
not be a multicolored brochure with gold-plated promises. 
  "No, we're promising no strange reforms, but we're promising 
to fight tooth and nail to create new jobs, and that will mean 
sacrifices," she told DAGENS NYHETER. 
  "We have been very careful about not promising anything that 
would mean new costs. It's not reforms but rather the opposite 
we have to implement if we win the election." 
  Sahlin does not think any party will promise gold and green 
forests. Instead the campaign will be a contest to see who can 
save the most, she believes. 
<H5>  Right To Work Restored </H5>
  "The party that can most convincingly show that sacrifices 
will lead to new jobs will win the election," she predicted. 
  Sahlin and Ingvar Carlsson will not commit themselves to 
rescinding every hateful act of the Riksdag and restoring the 
good old SDP order. This will only occur to the extent that it 
does not cost money. Thus far, then, in statements or motions, 
the Social Democrats have issued the following 
messages: 

  -  The right to work should be restored. That means 
that the probationary period should be reduced to six months and 
that employers on their own may not exclude any employee from 
the seniority list when pink slips are handed out. 
  -  "School 
money" should be abolished. That means that private schools can 
no longer ask towns for support for their activities. 
  -  The new 
grading system for elementary schools should be rescinded. 
  -  The 
family doctor law and the right of private specialist physicians 
to set up practices should be abolished. The right to freely set 
up private child-care centers might also be halted. 
<H5>  Home Care Allowance To Be Abolished </H5>
  In some instances, the Social Democrats will save bundles of 
money by rescinding nonsocialist decisions: 

  -  The home-care allowance is to be abolished if it has now 
been implemented. 
  -  Double taxation on stocks will be reintroduced 
and the capital gains tax on sales of stocks will be 
increased. 
  -  The property tax will not be abolished in 
1995. 
  -  Capital income taxes will remain at 30 percent. 
  Furthermore, the Social Democrats will hike the national tax 
for those with high incomes from 20 to 25 percent. This is a 
"temporary" tax hike but Sahlin would not say when the tax rate 
would be reestablished. That depends on how quickly the deficit 
in the labor market fund can be eliminated. 
  She said, however, that she was ready to defend a tax cut 
for 
those with high incomes the day Sweden's economy is back on its 
feet. 
<H5>  Opposes National Federation of Trade Unions </H5>
  "Yes, I get to go out and say that now we have carried the 
burdens together to achieve long-term financing of the labor 
market fund and now we will return to the 1990 tax reform." 
  The Social Democrats have explicitly pointed to one promise 
they are not making in this year's campaign: The compensation 
level for unemployment insurance will not return to 90 percent 
as quickly as the National Federation of Trade Unions [LO], 
among others, has demanded. 
  "I'm not promising any timetable, but it will not be during 
this fiscal year or the next one," Sahlin said. 
  First, compensation for those with long-term illnesses will 
be increased from 70 to 80 percent. 
  "I hope we can implement the increase during the term of the 
next government." 
  That would extend through 1998. 
  Nor are promises made to families with children. Might the 
promised 1991 increase in the child-care allowance be shelved 
for good? 
<H5>  No Pension Promises </H5>
  "The increase is not included in the electoral manifesto, 
but 
I will continue to be a politician for another 40 years," Sahlin 
replied hurriedly. 
  The Social Democrats have not forgotten the old promise 
about 
extended insurance for parents, she stated. 
  "It's clear we haven't. But that lies far in the future." 
  No promises are made to towns and county boards about higher 
state subsidies even if the Social Democrats strongly criticized 
cuts that were made in 1993. 
  No promises are made to retirees that pensions are to be 
completely inflation-proof and not just 98-percent so. 
<H5>  Fighting for Growth </H5>
  "We are now fighting for a new pension system and to achieve 
growth so we will be able to deal with the pensions of the 
future," Sahlin stated. 
  No promises are made to tenants and owners of single-family 
homes regarding a new home financing system. 
  "But we want to push for the discontinuation of the 
3-billion-[kronor] interest-rate subsidy that the nonsocialist 
government wants to implement in 1994-96," Sahlin remarked.

  [Excerpts] Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy 
in Cyprus, has declared that nothing can be achieved unless the 
advantages to be granted to the Turkish Cypriot side within the 
framework of the confidence-building measures package are 
guaranteed. Clark also announced that no agreement has been 
reached so far on the package. 
  The proximity talks on the confidence-building measures are 
continuing. President Rauf Denktas received Clark this morning. 
Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Atay 
Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister; Ozel Koray, 
under secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; 
presidential advisers; Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy in Cyprus; and UN experts also attended 
the meeting, which lasted approximately one and a half hours. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Clark remarked that the 
outcome of the confidence-building measures package will become 
clearer today. When a journalist reminded him of his statement 
yesterday and asked him if he is hopeful about reaching an 
agreement on one or two disputed issues, Clark said that these 
two subjects constitute the main points that cause differences 
of opinion between the two sides. He expressed the belief that 
if agreement is not reached because of these two issues, the 
efforts exerted so far will have been wasted. 
  Asked if the two issues concern Maras [Varosha], Clark noted 
that the aim is to formulate an agreement that will benefit both 
sides equally, adding that if Maras benefits the Greek Cypriots, 
then the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport must benefit the Turkish 
Cypriots. Clark declared that if the advantages granted to the 
Turkish Cypriots are not guaranteed against those granted to the 
Greek Cypriots, the benefits specified for the Turkish Cypriots 
cannot be implemented. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Denktas, Clark 
announced that no agreement has been reached so far on the 
confidence-building measures package. He said that he is now 
hopeful that an agreement will be reached on the implementation 
of the package. This has not been achieved yet, Clark remarked, 
adding, however, that he is still hopeful that a conciliation 
will be reached by the end of the month. 
  Pointing out that certain new alternatives emerged during 
today's meeting, on which both Denktas and himself will reflect, 
Clark said that in the coming days UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali will submit a report to the UN Security Council on 
the developments. 
  Questioned by a reporter on the disputed matters, Clark 
stated that he does not wish to comment on these issues at this 
stage. In answer to another question, Clark declared that if 
the package is to be implemented successfully, it must grant 
equal and concrete advantages to both sides. Asked if the 
proximity talks will continue, Clark said that he will leave the 
island today, but his assistant Feissel will continue the 
contacts. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement after the meeting, Rasit declared that an 
agreement that could endanger the interests of the Turkish 
Cypriot people will not be accepted. He noted that the Turkish 
Cypriots are conducting the talks in goodwill. In reply to a 
question, Rasit remarked that the issues of Maras and the 
Lefkosa Airport are interdependent and one must be careful to 
secure the balance. We have not yet reached a balance, he added.

  [Editorial Report] Two of Cyprus's Greek language dailies 
on 20 March 1994 carry columns reacting to U.S. Ambassador 
Richard Boucher's remarks at the Turkish Cypriot Rotary Club. 
  KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of the communist party AKEL 
[Restorative 
Party of the Working People] comments in a 175-word column on 
page five entitled "Forward, Not Backward," under the general 
banner "Aggressively." The writer says: "The U.S. ambassador 
was right in what he said to the Turkish Cypriot Rotary Club. 
This continuous recall of the past by the Turkish Cypriot 
leadership and the arguments such as the one that the Greek 
Cypriots seek union with Greece, or plan to exterminate the 
Turkish Cypriots, is a deceitful argument to justify the policy 
of division and the unacceptable status quo. The new 
negotiating effort seeks the reunification of our homeland 
through a federated system for the establishment of a better 
future that would allow the civilized cohabitation of all its 
citizens. Life goes on, though, and as sweeping changes take 
place throughout the world, Cyprus cannot live in the past. For 
this place to move ahead, it needs leaders with vision and 
goodwill. It needs leaders who look forward, not backward." 
  Right-wing nationalist I MAKHI carries on page three a 
150-word column entitled "No, Mr. Boucher," under the general 
banner "Struggling Comments." The writer says: "Speaking in 
the occupied area, U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher claimed that 
the Greek Cypriots no longer see their future in their 
dependence on Greece, but in their accession to the European 
Union. We think that Mr. Boucher does not interpret correctly 
the feelings of Cyprus' Hellenism. That is because he does not 
know how much the Hellenism of this victimized place is 
connected and dependent on Mother Greece. The U.S. ambassador 
and his government and all other foreign diplomats and their 
governments should know that this place, which has been Greek 
throughout the centuries, will not, under any circumstances, 
break off from the national stem. It will not betray its 
origin, neither its roots nor its ideals and principles. 
  It will, of course, continue its efforts for the accession 
of 
Cyprus to the European Union, but this is a different subject. 
Cyprus' bonds with Greece will never be broken because Greece is 
the source of light for Cypriot Hellenism's hopes and 
expectations. This Cypriot Hellenism replies to the U.S. 
ambassador: No, Mr. Boucher, you have not understood correctly 
the Greek Cypriot's heartbeat for Mother Greece."

<F P=106> [Unattributed column: "Rehearsal for Frenzied Action"] </F>
  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
has visited south Cyprus to hold talks and participate in 
various activities. The objective of his visit was to step up 
work for the realization of the Greek-Greek Cypriot joint 
defense doctrine through concrete measures. 
  The timing of Arsenis' visit was important. It coincided 
with the final stage of the result-oriented work on the package 
of confidence-building measures. The international community 
believes that the matter has been resolved. Many people and 
officials are convinced that a historic and peaceful step is 
about to be taken in Cyprus. 
  However, the frenzied activities planned with Arsenis in 
south Cyprus indicate that maintaining hope and optimism for the 
future is impossible. The fact that Arsenis is well-aware of 
the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's intentions and objectives and the 
frenzied activities the Greek Cypriots embarked on in the past 
clarify the meaning of the Greek-Greek Cypriot side's 
irresponsible behavior. Obviously, they wish to outline the 
fact that they "do not intend to participate in the search for 
peace." 
  How long will the Greek Cypriots, who have joined hands with 
Greece, be able to maintain the ugly manifestations of their 
sick and crooked communal approach? When will they abandon 
their stubborn behavior, which may lead to tragic developments? 
When will the Greek Cypriots act with reason? 
  Those questions are closely related to the agenda on Cyprus, 
questions that have caused a significant state of uneasiness. 
  The Greek Cypriots have deceived the world into believing 
that they are trying to find a durable solution to establish 
peace in Cyprus. Meanwhile, they have added a new dimension to 
their armament campaign and offensive preparations. Obviously, 
they are rehearsing for their final onslaught, which will be a 
frenzied action on their part. 
  How long will they continue to mock the world? 
  The fact that has become obvious is as follows: 
  While we mark the 30th anniversary of our resistance in 
Ghaziveran and Camlikoy [Kalokhorio], our sacred values, which 
our noble martyrs shed their blood to safeguard during our 
national resistance, still need to be protected with our life 
and blood. 
  That is the only conclusion we have drawn from developments 
in the Greek-Greek Cypriot front.

  [Text] Greece is firm about implementing the general 
principles prevailing when UN peacekeeping forces are made up. 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made his remarks when 
he was asked what Greece's stance would be following UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposal to send 1,000 
Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia. 
  According to Venizelos, no formal decision has been made. He 
said Greece is optimistic and expects the criteria governing the 
composition of the peacekeeping forces will remain in force. 
  Venizelos pointed out that Turkey, in addition to its 
historic impediment in the region, has no legal right to 
participate in the UN peacekeeping forces, because of the 
Turkish occupation of Cyprus. 
  Asked if Greece has expressed any desire to participate in 
the UN force, the spokesman said: It is one thing to utilize 
particular procedural possibilities and participate in 
conferences, and it is another thing to insist on the firm 
criteria on the composition of the UN peacekeeping forces. 
Venizelos stressed that Greece is not considering the 
possibility of Greek blue helmets going to Bosnia and said that 
Greek foreign policy moves within the framework that was decided 
at the latest party leaders conference chaired by the president.

  [Excerpt] Greece has told the United Nations it is willing 
to sign a draft agreement with The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM] and drop trade sanctions if the republic 
agrees to change its flag and amend its constitution, Mega 
Television News reported last night. Negotiations on the name, 
the report said, would be left to a later date. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met President 
Konstandinos 
Karamanlis yesterday and told him he had notified UN mediator 
Cyrus Vance of Athens' position, Mega said. Earlier, the 
president received Miltiadhis Evert, the New Democracy leader. 
  After the talks, Mr. Papoulias said Greece was now waiting 
for mediator Vance to take the initiative. "We are waiting to 
see what Mr. Vance will do," Mr. Papoulias told reporters. 
"But, of course, in the meantime we will continue consultations 
with our European partners." 
  Mr. Papoulias added: "There was no reaction from the 
president either to the Skopje sanctions imposed by Athens last 
month, or to the government's diplomatic efforts since then." 
He thus denied conservative news headlines over the weekend, 
alleging a growing rift between the government of Andreas 
Papandreou and the presidency, as regards the former's handling 
of the FYROM problem. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos later also 
dismissed 
such reports as a "nonissue," because "our constitutional order 
functions perfectly, and the government spokesman is not 
entitled to elaborate or comment on the presidency's own 
announcements." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Taha Akyol: "To the Polls"] </F>
  [Text] The PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist 
organization and the Democracy Party [DEP], which decided to 
boycott the elections in line with the instructions of the PKK, 
are trying to prevent people from voting in the upcoming 
elections. Kemal Burkay, who has never been involved in 
terrorism, on the other hand, has made a different appeal. 
Burkay's PSK [Socialist Party of Kurdistan] issued this 
statement: 
  "During the nationwide local elections to be held on 27 
March, support progressive, patriotic, and democratic 
candidates. If there are no such candidates in your area, then 
cast an invalid vote." 
  It is clear that these remarks defy the PKK. Kemal Burkay's 
separatist PSK has long made it clear that it is boycotting the 
PKK and that it will not attend its meetings. In actual fact, 
all Kurdish circles, who are not supporters of the PKK, are 
extremely uneasy about boycotting the elections. The separatist 
newspaper AZADI carries the following caption next to [DEP 
leader] Hatip Dicle's picture: "Those who effectively 
eliminated the People's Toil Party by attaching it to the Social 
Democratic Populist Party in the past, have now effectively 
terminated the DEP by withdrawing it from the elections." 
  Groups, which display hardly any differences with regard to 
ideological fanaticism, but which differ on whether to resort to 
terrorist or democratic methods, will present an interesting 
picture at the elections: 
  If the polls yield an exceptional number of invalid votes, 
over and above the normal levels, this will be an indication of 
the mass support for Kemal Burkay and anti-PKK separatists. 
  Although the PSK statement appeals for votes to 
"progressive, 
patriotic" candidates, if such candidates exist, the uncertainty 
with regard to these qualities and the differences in the number 
of invalid votes in the 27 March elections will give us an 
indication about the power of the appeal. 
  Low participation rates, on the other hand, will allow us to 
assess the grassroots of the PKK-DEP pair. Of course, the PKK 
is a terrorist organization. In places where terrorism is 
effective, it will be necessary to significantly deduct a 
"terrorist share" from nonvoter numbers. 
  In any case, if the PKK and the DEP had believed that they 
would receive significant votes, would they have decided to 
boycott the elections and threatened the candidates "to face the 
consequences if they participate in the elections?" 
  AZADI, which is aware of developments within the DEP and 
which has a faction in the party, condemns "state terrorism" in 
the known style and states that "the DEP should have 
participated in the elections even if it did not believe that it 
would receive sufficient votes." Those who cannot face free 
elections resort to terrorism. 
  Given these facts, I say that the citizens must certainly go 
and cast their votes in the elections. Even if you do not 
sympathize with any party, you should vote for one of them. 
Every vote you cast will help reduce the democracy foes in our 
society as well as the marginal elements to their ordinary 
levels.

  [Text] Brussels, March 23 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
is gearing up to normalise trade and aid relations with South 
Africa, members of a South African delegation said Wednesday [23 
March] after a visit to EU Headquarters here. 
  The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South 
Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days 
here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with 
the EU. 
  "We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing 
to do business with us," committee member Stella Sigcau said. 
  Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South 
Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the 
community following its first all-race elections next month. 
  The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political, 
trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections, 
to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades. 
  The South African authorities, including the African 
National 
Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for 
a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the 
post-apartheid economy. 
  But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South 
Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring 
African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can 
be more widely spread. 
  A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin 
said 
it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to 
join regional groupings. 
  These include the Southern African Development Community, 
originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid 
South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) 
group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention. 
  "But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will 
still be important to stimulate regional development," he said. 
  South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of 
the 
delegation, said: "There has been a greater convergence of 
ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern 
African." 
  South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of 
an "emerging consensus" about EU-South African relations, and 
said he was confident that agreement could be reached "on a fast 
track" after next month's elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Josef Vesely </F>
in Prague on 21 March: "The Czech Republic Could Chair the 
European Union, Says Claes"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said 
yesterday that he can envisage very well the day the Czech 
Republic will chair the European Union [EU]. 
  "You have a consolidated program for political 
democratization and you are also continuing to develop a very 
disciplined system for managing the economy," declared Claes, 
who has been on a visit to the Czech Republic since Sunday [20 
March], following his talks yesterday with his counterpart, 
Josef Zieleniec. "I am of the opinion that the declaration 
issued by the 12 in Copenhagen last June, which laid down strict 
conditions for the admission of countries like the Czech 
Republic, may play a historic role in this," he added. 
  [Vesely] Does the entire European Union have the same 
attitude toward the Czech Republic? 
  [Claes] Anyone in West Europe who thinks we can live on our 
own, as if on some island paradise and in isolation from the 
rest of the continent, is very naive. The movement toward 
integration has various motives; however, we have to stimulate 
it, because it is simply in our interest to do so. 
  [Vesely] The negotiations on expanding the European Union 
are becoming increasingly difficult. Would it not be enough -- 
at the moment -- just to have a common market? 
  [Claes] With regard to expanding the Union, it will be 
necessary first of all to fortify the existing European 
structure and to reinforce its foundations. This is not 
possible merely by strengthening the economic union. 
  [Vesely] What about the experience of the European Free 
Trade Association? 
  [Claes] The states represented by the four current 
candidates -- Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- indeed 
belonged to this free trade zone. However, after a certain 
time, they themselves recognized they need greater integration 
and a higher level of cohesion. They also recognized that this 
cohesion can only be guaranteed by a political union. All its 
signatories must speak unanimously later. Naturally, after this 
common point of view is reached by democratic means. 
  [Vesely] Are they being considered as a group or 
individually? 
  [Claes] In Prague, in particular, it is appropriate to 
emphasize that, in preparing for the next stage of expanding the 
European Union, we will -- obviously -- not negotiate as one 
bloc with another bloc. At this stage of accepting new members, 
we are not negotiating with the Scandinavians and the Austrians 
concurrently and under the same conditions. It was, and still 
is, possible that the outcome could be the Union's expansion to 
only 14 or 15 members instead of to 16 members. 
  [Vesely] Will this course of action also apply for Eastern 
candidates? 
  [Claes] Obviously, we will not be able to negotiate with the 
Eastern candidates as if they comprised a single bloc of states. 
Therefore, it is tenable that the Czech Republic may fulfill all 
the conditions at a time when the other states are still unable 
to do so. It is possible that the next stage of expanding the 
European Union will take place step by step, state by state. I 
think that this is the important message I can convey to you. 
It does not only concern your country, but is also associated 
with the issue of the quality of the European Union.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN)--The last soldiers of the German 
Somali contingent arrived at the military section of 
Cologne/Bonn airport today. Before German Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe disbanded the unit, he praised the "masterly 
performance" of all those involved in the operation. The German 
armed forces had "opened up a new chapter in their readiness for 
deployment and aid." Ruehe stressed the soldiers' humanitarian 
aid, in particular. Schools, roads, and bridges had been 
rebuilt, and the infrastructure of the region had been 
considerably improved. He said the German soldiers had "turned 
the Beledweynne region into a model UN area for the rebuilding 
of Somalia." 
  Ruehe said the public supported such missions and expected 
them of the Bundeswehr. This acceptance would not, however, 
have been reached without its participation in Somalia and 
earlier in Cambodia, as well as in the aid flights to Bosnia and 
the AWACS missions. Ruehe, however, admitted to shortcomings in 
the Somalia mission, for which he primarily blamed the United 
Nations. He referred to the interaction between Mogadishu and 
New York, which was less than ideal, as well as the lack of a 
viable political concept for Somalia. Arising out of this is 
the task of strengthening the United Nations' ability to act.

<F P=106> ["rmc"-signed report: "Somalia Mission Has Ended: Ruehe </F>
Praises the Bundeswehr"] 
  [Excerpt] Porz -- For Germany "Operation Somalia" has 
ended. With a military parade, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) welcomed the last soldiers 
returning from the East African country at the Cologne/Bonn 
airport and officially dissolved the "Somalia Support Committee." 
  The minister praised the Bundeswehr for the skill it showed 
in the Somalia operation. He stressed the "masterly military 
achievements" of all those involved in supporting the UN blue 
helmet forces. "Punctually like a German Intercity train, the 
German contingents were are the disposal of the United Nations 
in Beledweynne," the minister stated, addressing 197 soldiers 
who had returned aboard a Bundeswehr plane from Djibouti a 
little while earlier. Ruehe particularly stressed the "excellent 
leadership" of the Somalia unit -- of Colonels Harf and 
Kammerhoff. He awarded them the Federal Service Cross on behalf 
of the federal president. 
  As clear as Ruehe's praise for his troops was his criticism 
of the shortcomings of the United Nations -- the main reason the 
German contingent was not able to supply a 4,500-men strong 
Indian brigade with water, foodstuffs, and other goods, as 
originally planned. Ruehe spoke of "quickly changing UN plans" 
and of an "apparently not optimal cooperation between Mogadishu 
and New York." He also pointed out that the United Nations had 
"no solid political concept" for the peace process in Somalia.

<F P=106> [Report by Baudouin Bollaert: "European Union Enlargement </F>
-- the Twelve Caught in Institutional Trap"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Compromise Being Examined </H5>
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who is deeply involved 
in the EU [European Union] enlargement process, had a long 
telephone conversation on Sunday [20 March] with [Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe to discuss possible compromise solutions. 
The most credible -- although not liked by the EC Commission, 
"guardian of treaties" -- would consist of granting a reasonable 
"period for consideration" to the member states if a minority of 
them reaches 23, 24, or 25 votes, instead of the 27 required to 
block a decision. 
  According to Alain Juppe, France supports this solution 
"with 
three reservations": 
  1. It should not take the form of a protocol to be submitted 
for ratification, but simply that of a political commitment. 
  2. The period for consideration should not exceed three 
months. 
  3. This procedure should not be applied to "important 
questions." 
  In Mr. Juppe's view, the current dispute should not be 
regarded as an "ordinary quarrel on figures." Quite the 
reverse, "it is the philosophy of European construction which is 
at stake." Hence this assertion: "Better no agreement at all 
than a bad agreement." 
  Who will give in first? "The influence of a member state is 
measured primarily by the decisions it inspires, the actions in 
which it participates, and not by those it hampers," [European 
Affairs Minister] Alain Lamassoure said recently. "Yes to 
expansion, no to a more cumbersome structure." To that, [UK 
Foreign Secretary] Douglas Hurd replied that the British do not 
want to "torpedo" enlargement, and that it is possible to 
"reconcile" enlargement with "the protection of national 
interests." 
  If nobody budges, it is almost certain that the European 
Parliament will not give a positive opinion on enlargement. 
Other national parliaments could then follow suit. That will 
have two consequences: First, a real crisis among the Twelve 
with the June European elections in the offing. Second, a 
lamentable impression in the four candidate countries, which 
have to hold referenda on membership. There is a fine mess 
ahead unless common sense finally prevails.

  [Text] Rome, March 23 (AFP) -- Luciano Violante resigned 
Wednesday [23 March] as head of the Italian Parliament's 
Anti-Mafia Committee, a parliamentary source said. 
  Violante, 52, a deputy of the former communist Democratic 
Party of the Left (PDS) and a former magistrate, sent a 
resignation letter to the leaders of the upper and lower houses, 
the source said. 
  Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of rightwing Forza Italia (Go 
Italy) party, had demanded his resignation, after an article in 
the LA STAMPA daily quoted Violante as linking a close 
collaborator of the television magnate to the Mafia. 
  Violante implied in an interview with LA STAMPA that 
Marcello 
Dell`Utri, president of Fininvest's advertising company 
Publitalia, controlled by Berlusconi, was under investigation in 
Sicily in connection with a Mafia drug and gun-running affair. 
  The Anti-Mafia Committee leader later denied the comments 
and 
late Tuesday at a PDS rally in Sicily said he was "considering 
resigning to attack more freely the man who set a trap for me 
and is now using it."

  [Text] The Spanish Government advises all Spaniards 
residing in Algeria whose presence there is not essential to 
leave the country. The on-going attacks of foreigners by Islamic 
groups are the reason for this warning. The Spanish colony in 
Algeria numbers 327. The advice also covers diplomatic 
personnel whose protection has been increased over the last 
months. 
  The French authorities have also made a similar appeal to 
their community in Algeria. Yesterday's stabbing of a French 
businessman and his son in Algiers means that 31 foreigners have 
been murdered in Algeria over the last six months.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, this morning met Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas and ascertained that with his negative 
stance, the proximity talks have finally ended in deadlock. The 
UN envoy said that although the two sides are very close to an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's], the 
Turkish side did not consent to the agreement. 
  Stressing the importance of the confidence measures for the 
two sides, Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish 
Cypriot sides must reach agreement to implement them. He said: 
We do not have the Turkish Cypriot side's agreement. Clark 
insisted that the UN envoys will continue their efforts until 
the end of the month when UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali will prepare his report to the UNSC [UN Security 
Council] on the talks. 
  Clark concluded his contacts in Cyprus by meeting President 
Glavkos Kliridhis shortly after noon. The meeting concluded a 
short time ago. 
  In a statement in Larnaca after visiting the U.S. frigate 
USS 
Taylor, Kliridhis described his meeting with Clark as a clearly 
typical farewell visit. Kliridhis made it clear that there is 
no room to maneuver in the proximity talks right now because 
Denktas refuses to take a position on the UN documents on how to 
implement the CBM's. He added, however, that nobody knows what 
might happen before the UN secretary general submits his report. 
The president stressed: Denktas gives no answers. This is why 
I made it clear that I will not accept any new UN documents. 
  Shortly before meeting Kliridhis, Clark met the ambassadors 
of the five UN Security Council permanent members in Nicosia. 
In a joint statement, the five ambassadors reiterated their 
position that an agreement must be reached with no delay. The 
statement read by David Dain, British high commissioner in 
Nicosia, reiterates the support of the five states for the UN 
secretary general's efforts.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 23 (A.A.) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Wednesday [24 March] denied allegations suggesting that seven 
Westerners who came to southeastern Turkey for local Nevruz 
celebrations and nationwide mayoral elections were briefly 
detained by security forces. 
  Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told A.A. [ANATOLIA] that 
reports that a group of Westerners was detained was untrue. 
  Earlier in the day, Reuters news agency said security forces 
in southeast Turkey detained seven [words indistinct] activists 
on Tuesday [words indistinct]. 
  But Ataman said the group had not been detained, but 
willingly stayed overnight at a state guest house to await an 
escort deemed necessary for their onward journey to Siirt, a 
town in southeastern Turkey. 
  An official from the British Embassy in Ankara also denied 
allegations of detainment. 
  The seven Westerners were three Britons, one New Zealander 
and three Irish nationals. 
  Turkish officials have accused a number of Western press 
organizations of deliberately distorting news stories, 
particularly those about the situation in the southeast, so as 
to disrupt Turkey's human rights image. 
  The Government Press Office has told foreign journalists in 
the southeast they should not engage in activities likely to be 
construed as provocative or unprofessional. 
  Earlier on Wednesday, Ataman told reporters: "Certain groups 
with self-conferred observer duty are making use of the freedom 
and democracy in our country to indulge in subversive activity. 
  ``Unfortunately they include certain press groups which 
disseminate false news by provocation, prejudice and 
distortion.''

  [Text] The Turkish Foreign Ministry has described as 
ridiculous claims by Greek Cypriot authorities on the killing of 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, member of the Committee for Solidarity 
with the illegal PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization. 
  Speaking at his weekly news conference today, Foreign 
Ministry deputy spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that the accusatory 
language used in the statements made by Greek Cypriot 
authorities following the killing of Yeoryiadhis has caused 
shock and amazement. He noted that those who know Turkey are 
well aware that it is against any manifestation of terror, 
whatever the reason. Ataman added that it is the responsibility 
of those who make such provocative allegations -- the goals 
which they serve being very clear -- to prove them. 
  In reply to a question, Ataman described the conclusion of a 
series of military cooperation agreements during the sudden 
visit by the Greek defense minister to south Cyprus as goals and 
intentions that threaten stability.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Albert Chernyshev, Russian </F>
ambassador to Turkey, with Sirma Evcan in Ankara on 14 March] 
  [Text] "We need to trust each other. Suspicion is easy but 
it won't help either Russia or Turkey, both of which share 
common interests and a common house," Albert Chernyshev, 
Russia's ambassador to Turkey, said before his final departure 
for Moscow. 
  Chernyshev left Ankara at a time when certain problems were 
being openly voiced between Turkey and the Russian Federation. 
Turkey was suspicious that Russia was uneasy thinking Turkey 
may be encouraging the independence seeking of the different 
nationalities (which are of Turkic origins) within Russian 
borders. 
  Before leaving Turkey, which he said is a second home for 
him, Chernyshev discussed with the TURKISH DAILY NEWS the 
conflicts he believed were mostly the invention of those who 
know little about the 500-year-old relations between Turks and 
Russians. He said the fear of Russian expansionism is as 
unfounded as fear on the part of the Russians about Turkish 
expansionism. Starting with the recent Kurdish conference in 
Moscow and natural gas cut to Turkey, Chernyshev gave 
comprehensive responses to our questions on Russia's influence 
on the Caucasus and the Balkans, its views concerning the 
Turkish Straits, as well as the unwillingness of his country to 
reduce conventional arms in its border close to Turkey's Eastern 
border. Appointed to Ankara as ambassador of the Soviet Union, 
Chernyshev stayed in Turkey as ambassador of the Russian 
Federation after the dismantling of the USSR. He said he won't 
recommend this to anybody. Now he will be holding an important 
office in Moscow as deputy foreign minister responsible for 
Turkey as well as a substantial number of countries like the 
Turkic republics, Iran, Pakistan and others including the 
Maldive Islands, all of which the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
placed in the Eurasian context. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's expected visit to Ankara 
made Chernyshev postpone his departure. Yeltsin was expected to 
pay an official visit to Turkey sometime in the first quarter of 
1994, as he had promised Prime Minister Tansu Ciller during her 
visit to Moscow in September 1993. However, the Russian 
president could not materialize his visit during this period and 
Chernyshev had to go, saying that his president would most 
probably come sometime in April or May at the latest. He said 
the local election atmosphere in Turkey plus urgent issues in 
Moscow have delayed the visit but "there is no other reason or 
problem that caused the delay." In fact there is the Friendship 
and Cooperation Agreement waiting for signature when Yeltsin 
arrives, plus about 10 to 15 other agreements between Turkey and 
Russia. The new Russian ambassador to Turkey should be expected 
around the same time, Chernyshev said, adding there are 
presently two candidates being considered for this post. 
Chernyshev explained his two ambassadorial stages in Turkey as 
follows: "I have to mention that relations between Turkey and 
the Soviet Union were indeed very active before the dismantling. 
They were on a relatively high level. After the dismantling, 
our relations had to be renewed. 
  ``I want to underline that the approach from both sides was 
very rational. In other words by using the best of our previous 
experiences, we added new dimensions to these experiences in 
accordance with the current situations both in Russia and in 
Turkey. 
  ``We are still going through radical changes in Russia, 
passing to the market economy, and we have in this respect 
similarities with Turkey. We just celebrated last year the 
500th anniversary of relations between our two countries. 
  ``Our relations have very wide and rich experiences and 
traditions. We have experienced good and bad relations, but in 
general our relations have always entered a positive path. 
Today, we are working to bring our relations to a level of 
strong friendship and partnership.'' Chernyshev said both the 
Turkish Republic and the Russian Federation want the relations 
between the two countries, in volume and quality, to be like 
Turkey's relations with the United States of America. But, he 
said, when taken into consideration that Turkey and Russia live 
in the same area, then these relations should have be [as 
published] richer in content. 
  ``We have to work a lot still for this aim. The real formula 
for this is written in the declaration to be signed when Yeltsin 
comes to Turkey. I want to say that our countries should 
increase confidence in each other. I mean a higher level of 
confidence should not only remain in words. We should look in 
each other's eyes and trust each other,'' he said. 
<H5>  Kurdish Conference in Moscow </H5>
  But Turkey's worries increased when a Kurdish conference was 
held in Moscow last month and news came to Turkey that the 
Russian Ministry of Nationalities and Regional Political Affairs 
was among the sponsors of this conference where the Turkish 
Government's treatment of Kurds was condemned. Is Russia 
playing the Kurdish card against Turkey? 
  "We shouldn't play those cards. Let me speak about the 
Kurdish conference in Moscow. The Kurdish people are a reality. 
The Kurds live in several countries. In the Soviet Republic 
there were about one and a half million Kurds. Today, within 
the Russian borders there are about 500,000 Kurds. There are in 
fact about 100 different nations living within the Russian 
Federation. The Kurds in Russia wanted to discuss their history 
and culture at a conference, and the ministry responsible for 
this gave the permission because other ethnic nationalities also 
hold such conferences. And an official from this ministry 
attended the conference as a guest. But when it was understood 
that this conference was being exploited for other means--which 
the Turkish side knows very well--it was immediately clarified 
that the Government had nothing to do with this conference. We 
also stated that such a conference was not acceptable. In our 
official statement it was also mentioned that if similar 
conferences with the same aims were to be planned in the future, 
no permission will be given. There are always the separatists, 
the extremists who exploit such occasions. We explained to the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry and discussed all these in Moscow with 
Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Bilgin Unan. We understood each 
other and Mr. Unan was satisfied with the discussions in Moscow. 
But certainly Turkey should also be careful not to play similar 
cards. The Kurdish conference, however, had nothing to do with 
any retaliation to Turkey. This should be known. These are 
sensitive issues," he said. It is evident that Russia is also 
suspicious of Turkey's playing certain cards. The autonomous 
Turkic-Muslim Chechen Republic, for example, is causing a 
headache to Russia, but is there a terrorist organization of the 
Chechens outside that of the Chechen people? 
  Chernishev said theirs is a different kind of terrorism. 
"They want separation. They say they are independent, can this 
be acceptable? It should be well understood that we support 
territorial integrity of all the countries in the region because 
all these countries are multinational and with multi sects. 
Territorial integrity is a basic principle. This should be 
preserved very carefully. And parallel to this the rights of 
these minorities should also be accepted and preserved. 
Otherwise there will be outbursts. The Yugoslav situation is a 
very sad but a very good example for all of us. Political and 
territorial integrity is threatened by three factors, extreme 
nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and separatism. 
Sometimes there is no nationalism or religious fundamentalism 
but separatism is there. For example, in Bosnia this is the 
case." He said both in Turkey and in Russia there are 
politicians who provoke these issues without really knowing the 
situation. For example, why should the ultranationalist leader 
Zhirinovskiy's statements be taken into consideration? The USSR 
was suppressing nationalism, there were no conflicts like today. 
Today, there are extremists in Russia, but they should be 
assessed within their own limits. "We are in a really bad 
situation. Our people suffer, their living standard is getting 
very low. So someone like Zhirinovskiy comes and says he will 
solve all the problems. `Just trust me and your living 
conditions will improve when I come to office,' he says in 
simple terms, easy to understand and gets votes. But his powers 
shouldn't be overestimated. We are not scared that the Russian 
parliament will go for his views. Plus his party, the Liberal 
Democrat Party, is a leader's party and there are no strong 
politicians in this party." But when Zhirinovskiy gives 
guarantee to Europe saying Russia's eyes are turned to the south 
and not the west, this is enough cause to suspect Russia's 
motives in the region where Turkey is. Chernyshev said it is 
correct in the sense that Russia, being a part of Europe is at 
the same time an Eastern country. "We are also a part of Asia, 
as is the case with Turkey. For thousands of years we lived 
together with the Asian countries. We are used to each other, 
we understand each other and we feel each other and therefore we 
should continue to live together." He gave an example of this 
and said he has been witnessing at receptions in the Russian 
Embassy that towards the end of each reception the Turks and 
Russians are seen conversing together while the Westerners are 
among themselves. 
<H5>  A Regional Common Market </H5>
  He said: "This region is our common home. There are four 
international formations here. The Commonwealth of Independent 
States, The Black Sea Economic Cooperation, The Caspian Sea 
Economic Cooperation, which is for the time being a weak 
organization but one which has the prospect of developing, and 
the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). When we look at 
the memberships of these cooperations, we see that the majority 
of the members are the same in all four of them. In other words 
as an example Kazakhstan, a member of the Independent States, 
cannot be a competitor with Kazakhstan as a member of the ECO. 
So all four organizations should be in coordination, while each 
will continue in their separate fields of activities. And in 
the long run the cooperation between these four organizations 
will eventually come under a bigger umbrella which will be a 
single common market, a Regional Common Market. This is 
inevitable and other countries outside the region may also join 
this since it will be open to Europe, to the United States and 
others. This will be the Russian concept vis-a-vis our southern 
flank, and I will be the person responsible for the Southern 
flank of the Russian Federation." 
  Chernyshev will be working for this in Moscow, and he said 
this idea is getting positive response from the countries in the 
region, Turkey included. 
  "We need time, financial possibilities and hard work to 
establish this. I have talked about this with Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in Istanbul, and he also agrees in 
principle to this formation. Certainly, we have to understand 
each other better. I also spoke with President Suleyman Demirel 
on this subject, and he feels that it is possible too. It is 
not my project actually, but this is my approach that is finding 
support. I want other countries in this region to study such a 
possibility." 
<H5>  Natural Gas </H5>
  Chernyshev explained that Russia could not get from Ukraine 
the $1 billion for the natural gas they sold this republic in 
the last one and a half years. So Russia had to force them to 
at least give certain guarantees. "And we planned to reduce the 
flow of natural gas to Ukraine by one-third. But there was no 
plan to make any reductions in Russia's natural gas export to 
other countries through Ukraine. However, we realized that 
Ukraine was drawing natural gas from the export line. We had 
not thought about this, and the countries at the end of the pipe 
line which were importing gas from Russia suffered because of 
this. On March 10 before waiting for the result of our talks 
with Ukraine, we started increasing the natural gas flow, and 
starting from March 13, the same amount of gas will flow to 
Turkey. Turkey shouldn't worry, and the gas that Turkey could 
not get within these days will be compensated too. In 1994, 
Turkey will get as much as it wants from Russia, approximately 
5.5 billion meter cubes [cubic meters]. In accordance with our 
agreement, and within the limits of what Turkey will be 
consuming, this amount will go up to 7-8 billion meter cubes. 
There will be an additional 2 billion meter cubes towards 1996, 
and there will be two more increases made, each 2 or 2.5 billion 
meter cubes until the end of this century, within the framework 
of our new agreement," Chernyshev said. 
  He wanted to underline that it is not a matter of goodwill 
only, because Russia earns money from natural gas and they need 
this money. "Therefore we are aware of our responsibilities, 
and we do not want to lose our image as a trustable partner in 
this connection. I think such developments will not be repeated 
in the future," he stated. 
<H5>  The Caucasus </H5>
  Chernyshev stated that Russia and Turkey, even in the very 
sensitive issues such as Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, have similar approaches. "Our aim is the 
same. There may be differences in the means to reach the aim. 
In some issues Turkey has a harder line and in others Russia 
has. This is very normal. For example, not all the European 
countries share the same view regarding the solution to the 
Bosnian situation. Therefore we should not see these 
differences as unsolvable. Foreign Ministry Undersecretary 
Bilgin Unan and Mr. Adamishin (the Russian deputy foreign 
minister) had consultations in Moscow on these issues too, and 
both of them were very much satisfied with their discussions. At 
the end of these talks both sides found out that the aim is the 
same. I talked with Unan after his return from Moscow and he 
was really satisfied. I also heard President Demirel saying 
that he is also satisfied. So I think what comes out in the 
press is the result of limited information," he said. 
  On the subject of CFE, the reduction of Conventional Forces 
in Europe (from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains) which 
Russia is against when its Southern flank is concerned, 
Chernyshev said Russia has applied for revision of the CFE. He 
said: "Before the dismantling of the USSR, we had a military 
unit in the Caucasus for defense purposes; this is important. 
After the dismantling this military unit was removed from here. 
A little further up during the USSR period we had logistic 
units. We now have only the logistic units in the North 
Caucasus. We had to reorganize the new border we have there. 
This border is about 1,000 kilometers, and according to the CFE 
agreement,, only 250 tanks are allowed here. This will not 
respond to any military standard in Europe or elsewhere. 
Therefore we brought on the agenda that there should be 
additional technical units there. We want to increase these 
limits to the essential limit. We do not want to place 5,000 
tanks there because we are not planning to attack anybody. Only 
for defense purposes we need a reasonable amount." 
  Chernishev said the existence of a Commonwealth of 
Independent States should not be forgotten when people speak 
about Russian soldiers in the region too. "Some do not want to 
see this, but it is there and within this framework there is 
also a defense agreement. This should also be seen. For 
example, the countries around Tajikistan thought there should be 
joint military units to defend the borders because they are 
under threat. These units comprise the Russian, the Kazakhstan, 
the Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan units. 
  ``We have some units in Georgia and Armenia within the 
framework of the defense agreement. They are not big units. 
This is also normal, because look, in Turkey you have American 
bases and why should this be considered normal while in our case 
it is seen a threat. Why different standards to different 
countries?'' he asked. 
  He also explained that neither Georgia, nor Armenia and 
Azerbaijan have armies in the true sense even if the USSR 
armament was distributed among these countries when the union 
collapsed. So from the angle of security they feel they are not 
sufficiently equipped. They demanded Russian soldiers for a 
temporary period and they are paying for these soldiers. 
Chernyshev thinks there is nothing wrong with this since they 
are there for defense, just like the Turkish Third Army in the 
East has no aggressive aims but is only there for defense 
purposes. 
  Chernyshev said if the Azerbaijan authorities also want 
soldiers, then Russia will assess that too. But so far no such 
demand came from the Azeri side "but I think they wanted Russian 
soldiers at their borders with Iran but this issue has not been 
settled. We have talked about this with Azerbaijan." Russian 
soldiers are present on Armenia's border with Turkey and also on 
Georgia's border because these two countries asked for such a 
presence, the ambassador said. 
<H5>  Russia Has Influence Over Armenians and Serbs </H5>
  Russia has a certain influence over the Armenians, this is a 
fact. Chernyshev said: "However, this doesn't mean we have 
absolute power over them and we cannot dictate certain things to 
them. There is a misconception that Russia can make Armenia do 
anything. Had the situation been like that then there wouldn't 
have been any conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We are 
mediating because both the Armenians and the Azeris accept our 
mediation. In order to have success in mediation, the 
conflicting sides should accept such a mediation. Turkey is a 
little bit different from Russia in this respect because Armenia 
does not accept its mediation. Certainly Turkey has influence 
over Azerbaijan, and what I am trying to say is that all sides 
should use their power in a constructive, productive manner." 
Chernyshev said that in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Russians have influence over the Serbs and Turkey over the 
Muslims so both countries should work together. He said Russia 
has never been against Turkish soldiers in Bosnia. Besides, he 
said, it is not a matter of Russian or Turkish armies there. It 
is the United Nations peace forces. He thinks peace in Bosnia 
is not far even if there are the extremists who continue to 
escalate the conflict. All sides should be pushed to the table, 
Chernyshev believes. In Karabakh too everybody has come to 
understand that this bloodshed is useless. 
  Russia's peace plan for the Azeri-Armenian conflict is a 
cease-fire and Armenian withdrawal. Then the CSCE-Minsk peace 
process should work, and the solution of the problem should be 
reached through political means. "Certainly we are supportive 
of the CSCE-Minsk process, and if other countries have 
additional contributions, then they should contribute. For 
example, in the Bosnian situation you know how it happened, the 
NATO planes were about to bomb, everybody was waiting for that 
and the Russians--in addition to its participation in the peace 
process here--made another contribution and convinced the Serbs 
to withdraw their heavy arms. If, let us say, Turkey or the 
United States have additional contribution then they should go 
along with it," Chernyshev contended. 
<H5>  The Turkish Straits </H5>
  The collision of two tankers that put the Bosphorus in 
flames 
took place a day after our interview with the Russian ambassador 
who left Ankara a day after the collision. So we could not get 
his views about the accident that justified Turkey's stance on 
the security of the straits. 
  To our question about Russia's present position concerning 
the bylaws Turkey prepared on the subject without changing the 
essence of the Montreux Agreement signed in 1936, Chernyshev 
said: "When you look at the map, Russia's only access is the 
Black Sea and the Turkish Straits. We cannot go to the 
Mediterranean from the Baltic Sea. And this is not only for 
Russia but all the Black Sea countries. Besides all of us 
should understand clearly a second issue connected to this. In 
Montreux, an international regime has been set for the Turkish 
Straits. This cannot be a matter of good will or bad will. 
There is an international agreement on this, and we support 
this agreement and want to preserve it in the future. Other 
countries in our position also share this view. And sometimes 
it seems as if it is forgotten, but I know that Turkey also 
wants to keep this agreement as it is." 
  Chernyshev added Russia understands that the Bosphorus and 
the Dardanelles are not elastic, and therefore they are not 
against measures for the security of the straits as well as 
measures to ease the traffic. 
  Meanwhile Chernyshev expressed his satisfaction with the 
results of his work in Turkey. He said, "Of course I was not 
the only one working to achieve good results. 
  ``Our respective administrations were in a constructive 
dialogue all the time, and I did what I had to do within this 
framework. When I arrived here everything was ripe, Turkey was 
ready and so were we and thus we started.'' He said he is 
certainly sad to leave Turkey but at the same time he doesn't 
feel that he is actually leaving this country for good since he 
will be dealing with Turkey in Moscow too. "I have grown very 
fond of Turkey as a country and its people, maybe because I am a 
Turkologue. Turkey will remain a `first love' for me all my 
life," he said.

  [Text] Antalya--The working group operational basket 
meeting of the Arms Control and Regional Stability (ACRS) 
started in Antalya on Sunday [20 March], bringing together 
Israeli and Palestinian delegates for the first time since the 
Hebron massacre. 
  The working group, which is one of five established within 
the framework of multilateral, Middle East, peace talks, will 
take up issues such as the exchange of information on military 
activities, maritime measures and communications. 
  Turkey is the adviser for the first issue, while the maritie 
measures for search and rescue are prepared by Canada and 
communications by the Netherlands. 
  Suha Umar, the Foreign Ministry deputy director general, who 
briefed reporters, said that the group's first meeting had also 
been held in Antalya last year and the second in Moscow last 
November. 
  The working group sessions will continue for four days and 
the results will be submitted to a general meeting of the 
participating nations to be held in Doha in May. 
  "The reports that will be made at the end of the sessions 
are 
important both as new documents and as part of a larger whole. 
I think it will be possible to draw up the general framework of 
a general document on arms control and security in the Middle 
East," Umar said. 
  The meeting is important in the sense that it brings 
together 
all the Middle Eastern states for the first time since the 
Hebron massacre. 
  The participating states include Turkey, Netherlands, 
Canada, 
United States and Russia, as well as Jordan, Israel, Palestine, 
Oman, Egypt, Qatar, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, 
Tunis, Yemen and Kuwait.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In an airport statement before 
leaving for Romania today, President Suleyman Demirel said: 
  [Begin recording] As you know, significant activity can be 
discerned in Turkish-Romanian economic relations. The number of 
Turkish entrepreneurs investing in Romania has recently been 
increasing and currently stands at 2,500. During our visit, we 
will also inaugurate a Turkish-Romanian bank. I would also like 
to announce that the number of mutual tourist visits between the 
two countries has exceeded 1 million in recent years. 
  Moreover, the existing problems and new developments in the 
Balkans as well as in the Caucasus and the Middle East make it 
imperative for Turkey and Romania, two important countries of 
the region, to hold more frequent contacts at every level. The 
restructuring of Europe also makes these contacts necessary. 
[end recording] 
  Demirel explained that ways to developing relations with 
regard to bilateral and international issues will be discussed 
during the visit. The president added that the possible 
contributions by Turkey and Romania to peace, stability, and 
cooperation in the region will also be reviewed. 
  Demirel was seen off at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by 
Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly. General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, and 
other officials were also present. Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin also left for Romania together with the president.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PASOK and PKK Cooperate"] </F>
  [Text] The Greeks have created opportunities for militants 
of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] to carry out their 
activities in Greece. They have also provided funds for the PKK 
and supported that organization in the international domain. 
Many Greeks participated in the rally the PKK militants 
organized in Germany for "Freedom to Kurdistan" and carried 
banners of the Greek Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. 
They chanted slogans against Turkey, which they described as 
the "common enemy." 
  Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that the Greeks facilitate 
efforts by PKK militants to escape from Turkey through the Greek 
islands in the Aegean Sea. 
  It will be recalled that several Greek deputies and generals 
visited PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in the al-Biqa' Valley some 
time ago. They informed him that they will give every kind of 
support to PKK's "justified" struggle against Turkey. 
Meanwhile, the Greeks are trying to establish a radio for the 
PKK in Greece. The PKK radio will be in an area close to the 
Turkish border and will broadcast on the FM band. Furthermore, 
they have allowed the PKK to open an office in central Athens. 
  It has been reported that relations between the Greek 
Cypriot 
side and the PKK go far beyond the visit of Greek Cypriot 
deputies to PKK camps and the opening of a PKK base in south 
Cyprus. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the 
Colt [as published] firm some time ago to convey the serial 
numbers of M-16 rifles the Turkish security forces impounded 
from PKK militants and ask for information on the country that 
purchased them from that firm. The officials responded by 
disclosing that the rifles in question were sold to south Cyprus.

  [Text] Ankara--Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said that 14 
terrorists, and the bodies of two more, have been returned to 
Turkey by Iranian officials. The men had fled to Iran during 
the operations in Igdir and Agri, the ANATOLIA News Agency 
reported. Mentese said in a written statement that great 
achievements had been made in the struggle against terrorism and 
that the PKK [outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan] had been 
severely damaged by recent military operations. 
  Mentese said that in last week's operations 78 terrorists 
had 
been killed and 82 captured and added: 
  "Thanks to the decisive policies, both at home and abroad, 
followed by the government since coming to power, great progress 
has been made in the fight against terrorism." 
  In the provinces of Erzurum, Kars and Ardahan, 53 terrorists 
were killed and 66 captured, in Agri two were killed and 19 
captured, in Tunceli 12 killed, in Mus three killed, in 
Kahramanmaras eight killed, in Igdir 16 captured and in Icel 36 
terrorists were captured, making a total of 160. Five terrorist 
hideouts were discovered and 103 people were arrested for giving 
aid to terrorists. 
  Mentese said "By returning the terrorists, the Iranians have 
once more demonstrated their willingness to cooperate in the 
struggle against the PKK." 
  Three rocket launchers, 20 rockets, 28 rifles, five pistols, 
22 grenades, documents, food, clothing and medical equipment 
were seized during the operations. 
  Interior Minister Mentese said that with the support of the 
legislature, the judiciary, the executive, the media and the 
public, the issue of terrorism would be erased from the agenda 
and that the peace and trust deserved by the people would be 
established for good. 
  It was said that security precautions were tightened due to 
the upcoming elections and the Newroz celebrations. In a 
statement from the Emergency Rule Region Governor's office the 
deaths of 18 terrorists in clashes with security forces in the 
provinces of Hakkari, Sirnak and Tunceli were reported. 
  One of the dead was reported to be a high ranking member of 
an outlawed leftist organization who had escaped from Nevsehir 
prison some time ago. 
  Two children named Saddulah Gokyavas and Nihat Aydin were 
killed in an explosion in a village in Bingol. It was said that 
the explosion might have been due to a mine or bomb left by 
soldiers. The mayor of Bingol, Selahattin Kaya confirmed the 
news. The soldiers had apparently dug a trench while they were 
in the area and had afterwards left. The explosion took place 
while the children were playing. 
  The bodies of the children were taken to Bingol but it was 
reported that there was trouble at the scene of the autopsy.

  [Text] Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Argentina 
clashed over the disputed Falkland Islands in a parliamentary 
forum here Thursday [24 March], with the Argentinian Senate 
leader calling on Britain to resume negotiations on sovereignty. 
  "This claim aims at putting an end to the anachronistic 
colonial situation upheld by Great Britain on a portion of 
Argentinian territory, in an open violation of the fundamental 
principles of international law," Eduardo Menem told the 
Interparliamentary Union [IPU]. 
  "The unilateral decisions made by the United Kingdom as 
regards oil in the Malvinas Islands (the Argentinian name for 
the disputed islands) and the extension of its alleged 
jurisdiction around South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, 
prove the British lack of disposition to start effective 
negotiations with Argentina," said Menem, brother of Argentinian 
President Carlos Menem. 
  But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the 
issue, saying "bilateral mechanisms are already in place to 
continue discussions on all subjects. Mr Menem's statement 
seems to ignore the rights of the Falkland Islanders in the 
matter of self-determination," he added. 
  The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in 
1992.

  [Text] Brussels, March 24 (AFP) -- The former Yugoslav 
republic of Slovenia will sign up to the Partnership for Peace 
programme of military cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation Wednesday [30 March], a NATO official said Thursday. 
  Slovenia will become the first part of the former Yugoslavia 
to sign up to the NATO programme. Bosnia-Hercegovina and 
Croatia have also expressed interest in joining the Partnership, 
although no decision has been taken on it, the official said. 
  The Partnership for Peace programme allows for joint 
manoeuvres, military planning and peacekeeping operations with 
the existing NATO members. 
  NATO has already decided that four other countries can join 
the programme if they wish -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and 
Switzerland. 
  Russia is expected to sign up to the programme before the 
end 
of April. Georgia signed Wednesday, joining Albania, Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. 
  Among the former Soviet republics, only Tajikistan has said 
it is not interested in joining the programme, the official 
added.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Four Prime Ministers To Turn on the </F>
Charm"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- Well aware that strong forces in the 
European Parliament [EP] -- the European Union's [EU] directly 
elected assembly -- are threatening to throw a monkey wrench in 
the works of the EU's plan to admit new members. Gro Harlem 
Brundtland and her fellow prime ministers from Sweden, Finland, 
and Austria have their sights set on a joint meeting with the 
Parliament's elected representatives. The meeting is expected 
to take place in Strasbourg on 19-20 April. 
  The timing of this obvious and unorthodox charm offensive on 
the part of the applicants has not been chosen by chance. For 
the meeting will take place immediately before the Parliament is 
timetabled to approve the outcome of membership negotiations on 
4 May and give the decisive go-ahead for EU enlargement. Some 
260 of the Parliament's 518 members must vote "yes" to new 
members. 
  The aim behind meeting the European Parliament deputies is 
to 
increase pressure on them so that they do not slow down EU 
enlargement. By their mere presence the applicant nations' 
prime ministers will also signal their interest -- not something 
which today's EU members lavish on the Parliament. 
  "A stroke of genius from the applicants," one source at the 
Parliament told AFTENPOSTEN. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Bente Egjar Engesland report: "Warm Defense of Negotiated </F>
Package"] 
  [Text] Norway has achieved good solutions in "all the 
central areas," the prime minister said in defense of the EU 
[European Union] agreement yesterday. 
  The new phase of the battle surrounding the EU was marked in 
earnest yesterday with Gro Harlem Brundtland's report to the 
Storting. After 11 months of negotiations, she was able 
yesterday to brief the Storting on the agreement and make her 
formal recommendation: yes to EU membership. In the course of 
the spring Storting session, the government will put forward its 
own report to the Storting on the agreement and an Odelsting 
bill for a referendum. 
  The prime minister warmly defended the European Union's 
"central idea" of "committed cooperation among independent 
countries," before she turned to the contents of the agreement. 
  "Our point of departure was not to demand lasting exemptions 
from the EU's body of regulations. In the negotiations the 
government had more ambitious goals -- we have worked for 
peculiarly Norwegian features and conditions to become part of 
the EU and not for them to be exemptions," she said. The 
government takes the view that Norway's "vital interests" have 
been met with understanding. The prime minister pointed to the 
detailed statement on sovereign rights over energy resources, 
new arrangements for northern agriculture, and the fact that 
Norway's arrangements for the administration of fisheries 
resources will form the basis for the EU's fisheries policy in 
northern waters. 
  On the subject of the controversial fisheries agreement, she 
said that Norway has ensured "its right of ownership over our 
share of fish resources," that the administration policy in 
northern waters will be continued after a transitional period, 
and that there will be duty-free access to the EU market for 
fish and fish products. 
  The prime minister categorically rejected the notion that 
Norwegian fishermen will have competition in their fishing 
waters: No one will be allowed to fish for fish to which Norway 
has the rights today. As in the past we will own over 98 
percent of our share of cod in northern waters, and it is 
therefore not the case that Spaniards or others can threaten the 
resource base of Norwegian fishermen, she said. Only on one 
point did she declare herself "not fully satisfied" -- Ireland's 
freedom to fish its mackerel quota in the North Sea for part of 
the year. 
  Around 85 percent of the land under agricultural cultivation 
in Norway has been classified as production areas with special 
difficulties. The prime minister also stressed the new system 
of support for northern agriculture, which embraces the whole of 
northern Norway and parts of southern Norway. The government is 
"confident" that it will be possible to carry out the necessary 
reorganization of Norwegian agriculture in such a way that "new 
development possibilities" are guaranteed. 
  A basis for Norway's membership application was the 
Maastricht Treaty's goal of political, economic, and monetary 
union. Yesterday the prime minister focused on the goals of a 
reduction in the public budget deficit, low inflation, low 
interest rate levels, and a stable exchange rate. She called 
these central elements in an economic policy for full 
employment. According to the government, a common currency will 
prevent speculation against individual currencies. 
  Yesterday Gro Harlem Brundtland concentrated on individual 
elements in the agreement, but she also stressed her fundamental 
argument for saying yes to the EU -- Norway will have greater 
influence if it is a member than if it remains outside. "We are 
not giving away our right of self-determination if we become an 
EU member -- we strengthen our self-determination in relation to 
forces over which we today have too little control," she said. 
She stressed in particular the security policy challenges in 
Europe and said that no individual country can secure security 
and peace alone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Javier Solana by Milos </F>
Sklenka in Madrid; date not given: "The European Union's 
Premature Enlargement Toward the East Could Do It More Harm Than 
Good"] 
  [Text] A crucial round of talks involving the foreign 
ministers of the European Union's [EU] member countries on 
institutional reforms and the voting system following the EU's 
possible enlargement from the current 12 to 16 countries will 
take place in Brussels tomorrow. For more than two weeks 
Britain and Spain have been blocking the admission of Austria, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway because of a difference of opinion 
about the size of the so-called blocking minority, that is, the 
number of votes necessary to veto decisions in the EU Council 
that have been approved by a qualified majority. HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY asked Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana to clarify 
Madrid's position on this important issue. 
  [Sklenka] Ten EU member states are of the opinion that the 
number of votes for the so-called blocking minority must be 
increased in a corresponding manner from the current 23 to 27 
along with the enlargement of the Union. This would de facto 
maintain the present system, since, given the increase in the 
overall number of votes in the EU Council from 76 to 90, the 27 
votes necessary for the minority blocking of decisions would 
mean the same as the 30 percent of all votes required until now. 
Why, then, are Madrid and London impeding this logical course 
of action? 
  [Solana] A question devised in such a manner does not give a 
true picture of the overall problem of voting. Spain, in 
essence, agrees with increasing the size of the blocking 
minority to 27 votes. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take 
into consideration that the number of votes of the individual 
countries in the EU Council is determined by the size of their 
population. Therefore, at the same time, we are trying to 
stipulate that, if two so-called large countries and one small 
country join together and these three states reflect the opinion 
of at least 110 million people, the system of 23 votes should 
apply as it has done until now. 
  [Sklenka] Spain has been strongly criticized for its 
national egoism, in view of its uncompromising stance on 
fishing, which twice held up the EU's negotiations with Norway, 
and its current unconstructive attitude toward voting rights. 
Madrid, along with London, is even being described as an 
obstacle to the creation of a new European architecture. 
  [Solana] Our country has traditionally been one of the main 
supporters of a united Europe. 
  Only a few states have done as much as Madrid for the 
formation of the European Union. Our aim is not to slow down 
the process of closer European integration; we are merely trying 
to ensure that, given it, Spain's national interests are not 
neglected. 
  [Sklenka] Nevertheless, some of the world's media are 
saying, in connection with the negotiations on enlargement, that 
in order to create a functioning federal Europe, it will be 
necessary for the Union to ditch countries such as Spain and 
Greece, which are an intolerable burden. They do not contribute 
anything to the coffers in Brussels, and they only want greater 
support. What is your view of such criticism? 
  [Solana] It is not true that we do not contribute anything 
to the EU budget. Spain is even a net contributor, that is, we 
put more into the communal coffers than we get back. 
  [Sklenka] In the countries of Central and East Europe, which 
are interested in becoming fully fledged EU members in the near 
future, there are -- nevertheless -- anxieties about Spain's 
possible negative stance on expanding the Union eastward. 
  [Solana] These anxieties are absolutely unfounded. Madrid 
generally supports the EU's gradual rapprochement with the East 
European states. The countries of this region must realize, 
however, that submitting the application itself does not mean 
anything. The admission of each country is conditional upon 
fulfillment of a whole series of political prerequisites and 
macroeconomic indicators. Membership in the Union also means 
giving up some national sovereignty and being subject to the 
criteria of the political, economic, and monetary union. Since 
this requires, among other things, the maximum possible 
liberalization of the domestic market and the granting of equal 
rights to domestic enterprises and their foreign competitors, 
each applicant has to work out in advance what he will gain by 
such a step and what he will lose by it. As far as the EU is 
concerned, it will be necessary to reform the institutional 
structures there further so that, given the larger number of 
members, the Union maintains its ability to function and 
operate. It is obvious, therefore, that the two sides have to 
prepare thoroughly for such a step and time it so that the 
actual admission of the East European states to the Union brings 
mutual benefits. The EU's premature expansion toward the east 
could do the countries there more harm than good.

  [Text] Brussels, March 23 (AFP) -- Economic recession in 
the European Community has probably touched bottom, but 
unemployment will keep climbing to a record high in 1995, EU 
Finance Commissioner Henning Christophersen said here Wednesday 
[23 March]. 
  In a report presented to the European Parliament, he 
predicted that recovery would be slow, with gross domestic 
product (GDP) inching up to an annual growth rate of 3 percent a 
year in 1996. 
  But Christophersen said there were no grounds for changing 
last November's estimate that GDP growth, after shrinking 0.3 
percent in 1993, would expand only weakly by 1.25 percent this 
year and 2 percent in 1995. 
  He said the unemployment rate -- 10.9 percent at the end of 
last year -- would reach a record 11.25 percent in 1995 before 
beginning to decline. 
  But the commissioner warned that the predictions were highly 
uncertain, and that recovery depended heavily on consumer 
confidence. 
  The EU's executive European Commission expects inflation -- 
3.4 percent last January -- to keep falling. 
  But it says efforts to cut government budget deficits -- 
essential for strong growth -- are being hindered by the glacial 
pace of recovery. 
  The report suggests that interest rates should be cut in 
order to fuel confidence and recovery, provided that inflation 
keeps falling. 
  It adds that even moderate economic growth is dependent on 
rising exports, investments and consumer confidence, along with 
continued pay moderation and government budget discipline. 
  Christophersen stressed the importance of steps to stimulate 
the economy, such as more research and training, plus 
implementation of an EU plan to spend massively on 
infrastructure transport, telecommunications and energy networks.

  [Text] Brussels, March 24 (AFP) -- Frauds cost the 
European Union [EU] some ECU394.2 million (453.3 million 
dollars) in 1993, up from ECU269 million in 1992, EU Budget 
Commissioner Peter Schmidhuber said Thursday [24 March]. 
  In agriculture spending, member states counted 1,298 cases 
of 
fraud, at a cost totalling ECU248.3 million. 
  In the rest of the budget, 1,001 cases of fraud were 
uncovered costing ECU145.9 million. The European Union budget 
for 1993 was ECU73.4 billion, half of which was devoted to 
agricultural spending. 
  "The frauds are more and more sophsiticated and more and 
more 
refined with the help of new technology," Schmidhuber said. 
  The commissioner said international criminal organisations 
had started operating against the Union and were escaping 
serious punishments because of a lack of cooperation among the 
member states. 
  The Union needs to improve its policing of the spending it 
agrees to, Schmidhuber said. 
  "We depend too much on chance. We need to create links 
between our data banks and concentrate our efforts on the 
largest types of fraud," he said. 
  The Commission is going ask the Council of Ministers to 
agree 
to write community fraud into their countries' domestic 
legislation, with tough punishments those found guilty of 
committing the frauds. 
  Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen has already compiled 
a 
"blacklist" of firms found guilty of defrauding EU agricultural 
spending. 
  Britain on Wednesday put forward a similar proposal to the 
justice and interior ministers meeting in Brussels. 
  Legislation is going to be simplified to reduce the 
possibilities for agricultural frauds, the EU comissioner said. 
  The Commission will also set up, for a trial period, a free 
telephone number for people to call in with information relating 
to frauds. Rewards would not be offered, Schmidhuber said.

  [Text] Luxembourg, March 24 (AFP) -- The European Court of 
Justice turned down a complaint from Air France here Thursday 
[24 March] that the British Airways purchase of the airline Dan 
Air might have breached European Union competition rules. 
  The Court turned down Air France's claim that the purchase 
of 
Dan Air in 1992 should have been investigated by the EU 
competition authorities. 
  The Court said Dan Air's turnover was not big enough to 
trigger an anti-trust investigation. 
  The European Commission approved the purchase last year 
after 
ruling that the resultant merger would not produce unfair 
competition for the Belgian airline Sabena.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kucan in Vienna on Working Visit"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- The talks held by Slovene President Milan 
Kucan in Vienna on Thursday [24 March] focused on issues of 
European integration, the crisis in the Balkans, bilateral 
relations, and the nuclear power plant at Krsko, near the 
Austrian border. 
  Kucan met Federal President Klestil, Federal Chancellor 
Franz 
Vranitzky, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and Nationalrat 
President Heinz Fischer for talks. 
  In connection with the Krsko nuclear power plant, Kucan, who 
expects Vienna to support Slovenia's European Union [EU] 
ambitions, said that Slovenia was as worried about the safety of 
its citizens as Austria. 
  Kucan emphasized his country's interest in Austrian EU 
accession and voiced his hopes that Vienna's experience in the 
entry talks with Brussels would also benefit Ljubljana in its 
objective to join the EU. 
  Vranitzky underlined that he agreed with Kucan that the 
process of European integration would have a positive influence 
on bilateral relations. 
  On the issue of Krsko, Kucan and Vranitzky said that on 
Thursday they did not discuss a date for the resolution on 
shutting down the nuclear power plant near the border area. 
  According to Kucan, the plant can be completely shut down 
only 10 years after Ljubljana makes a decision to this effect. 
He pointed out that first one must clarify the question of an 
energy supply for Slovenia, citing as an example more 
hydroelectric power stations on the Save River. Moreover, the 
decision in Krsko does not lie with Slovenia alone but also with 
Croatia, which also has an interest in the nuclear power plant. 
  Klestil announced that he hinted to Kucan that Austria would 
be interested in further developing an early warning system and 
that, at the next meeting of Central European presidents, he 
would advocate a nuclear-free zone in the region.

  [Text] Vienna, March 24 (AFP) -- Visiting Slovenian 
President Milan Kucan warned Thursday [24 March] of the 
emergence of a two-speed Europe, saying the split between a 
highly developed West and underdeveloped East spelt increased 
danger. 
  In a speech to the Austrian parliament in Vienna, Kucan said 
"two or three Europes" could emerge, including a "para-Europe" 
of which Russia would be the prime component, which would be 
distinct from the European Union and those states hoping to join 
it. 
  Kucan, speaking during a one-day visit, said the Russian 
presence in parts of former Yugoslavia may signal the creation 
of two separate "Byzantine" and "West" European civilisations. 
  The divergence between East and West Europe was becoming 
"more and more dangerous," Kucan warned. 
  The president of the former Yugoslav republic also met 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and his Austrian counterpart Thomas 
Klestil. 
  Kucan backed Austria's planned admission to the European 
Union, adding that he expected Slovenia to receive the same 
support for its own eventual membership.

<F P=106> [Article signed MTH/RHR: "European Parliament: Enlargement </F>
Linked to Fair Solution on Institutional Question"; as released 
by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 23 Mar (BELGA) -- The European Parliament 
(EP) warned on Wednesday [23 March] that it would not approve 
accession agreements with Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden 
if it involved the weakening of the decisionmaking process 
within the European Union (EU). 
  MEP's [members of the European Parliament] at a two-day 
meeting in Brussels accused Great Britain of wanting to "dilute" 
the Union, of "depriving the Treaty of Maastricht of its 
meaning," and of seeking to serve domestic political interests 
by refusing to adopt the decisionmaking process after the four 
candidates join the Union. 
  The blocking minority within the Council of Ministers is at 
present 23 votes out of 76. Logically enough, this should be 
increased to 27 votes out of 90 following enlargement in order 
to keep it at 30 percent of the votes. 
  Great Britain and Spain, for different reasons, are opposed 
to this purely mathematical change in the blocking minority and 
are asking for it to stay at 23 votes out of 90, which allows 
two large countries and one small one to block any decision. 
  After having listened to European Foreign Affairs 
Commissioner Hans van den Broek stress the negative effects of 
any change to the membership timetable, the MEP's stressed that 
no compromise was possible on an institutional retreat. The EP 
considers a blocking minority of 27 votes to be absolutely 
essential. 
  "Even if a compromise is reached, it will always be weak and 
unacceptable to the EP," stressed Raymonde Dury (Belgian, 
Socialist Party). 
  Mr. van den Broek stated that the Twelve would try to break 
the deadlock again at their informal meeting next weekend in 
Ioannina, Greece. If they manage to reach an agreement on the 
institutional question, the EP will have little time to approve 
the accession agreements before the European elections in June, 
thus allowing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to join the 
Union on 1 January 1995 as planned.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Binyon and Nicholas George: "Rush To </F>
Expand EU Is Blamed on Swedish Law"] 
  [Text] Stockholm -- The Swedish constitution is the main 
consideration behind the urgency of the timetable for the four 
applications to join the European Union [EU], a senior British 
official said yesterday. 
  Under Swedish law a bill which involves changes to the 
country's constitution must be approved by two separate 
parliaments. The Swedish parliament is dissolved in June, with 
a general election in September, and unless the constitutional 
bill paving the way for the treaty can be presented to the 
current parliament, the final decision might have to wait a 
further four years until after the next general election. 
  Swedish officials were yesterday urgently studying ways 
around the obstacle. One would be to allow a vote on the 
constitutional bill before the outcome of the negotiations with 
the EU were known. 
  An alternative would be to present the constitutional change 
to the new parliament, and then call a general election shortly 
afterwards so that a fresh parliament could also add its 
approval. 
  This would be a highly unorthodox move, breaking the 
practice 
of fixed-term parliaments but it is not impossible for the Prime 
Minister to call a snap election. 
  Sources in Sweden said yesterday that the worries about the 
timetable have subsided as constitutional experts have insisted 
that Swedish membership would not be jeopardised by such 
technicalities. 
  A failure to settle quickly the dispute over EU minority 
voting rights could jeopardise the whole enlargement process, 
Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's Minister of European Affairs, warned 
yesterday. Sweden, Finland and Norway have been relaxed about 
the dispute which has pitted Britain and Spain against the ten 
other EU members. However, concern is now growing that the 
inability of the Twelve to settle the matter will force a 
postponement of the Nordic countries' entry into the EU, 
scheduled for January 1, 1995. Any such delay would have a 
negative effect on the outcome of forthcoming referendums to be 
held on the issue in the three countries, Mr Dinkelspiel said. 
A majority of voters in Norway and Sweden oppose membership and 
the governments face an uphill task in convincing them 
otherwise. In Finland a majority supports joining. 
  "I think we are approaching a critical point. If there is a 
further delay it will not be possible for the European 
Parliament to deal with the enlargement negotiations this spring 
and that will effectively delay entry," Mr Dinkelspiel said. 
  On a visit to Stockholm earlier this week Kenneth Clarke, 
the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, defended Britain's stance. 
  "I think if you in Scandinavia had a government that had 
found itself being out-voted all the time because its political 
colours don't match the political colours of most of the other 
governments, you will find there is a growing resistance to 
that," he said.

<F P=106> [John Palmer report: "Partners Angry at UK Stand"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Without a political miracle in the 
deadlocked talks about voting rights this weekend, Britain's 
European Union [EU] partners are convinced that the planned 
timetable for admitting four new member states is as good as 
dead. 
  Angry EU governments fear the British government has decided 
to bow to the Conservative Euro-sceptics and will kick the 
problem into touch until after the European Parliament elections 
in June. 
  The last flickering chance of an agreement now rests on a 
Greek presidency proposal under which the blocking minority vote 
in the Council of Ministers would be set at 27 -- as the 
majority want -- not 23 as the British insist. But countries in 
a minority with only 23 votes could seek a delay of a few months 
to try and to reach a compromise -- well short of the British 
demand for an indefinite delay of such sensitive issues to at 
least 1996. 
  If the weekend meeting of foreign ministers in the northern 
Greek town on Yannina breaks up, as so many others have in 
recent weeks, without an agreement, the other EU governments 
will seek to ensure that the British government carries the full 
blame. 
  It is felt that the collapse of the hoped for accession of 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next January would deal a 
fearsome blow to the credibility of the European Union just when 
it was recovering from the Maastricht controversy and the 
disintegration two years ago of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. 
  The most likely result of renewed deadlock at Yannina is 
that 
the problem would be referred to the Corfu heads o government 
summit in June -- after the European elections. However, even 
if an agreement is then reached by the 12, the European 
Parliament would not begin to discuss the treaties of accession 
until the autumn. 
  That would rule out the four newcomers joining as planed in 
January next year. 
  Some optimists in the Nordic countries hope that the entry 
date might be put back to July next year, but most fear 
accession to the EU will have to be delayed until 1996. 
  "Do the British realise what a powerful weapon they have 
given to the anti-Europeans and do they care?" one Scandinavian 
diplomat asked yesterday. 
  The language being used even by some governments normally 
more sympathetic to London about the tactics of the British 
government was unusually robust. "I can tell you that British 
relations with the Netherlands will not be the same again after 
the way in which Mr Major spoke about us and the Belgians in the 
House of Commons this week," one senior Dutch official said 
yesterday. 
  Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission 
said 
in a French press interview yesterday that a full blooded crisis 
was preferable to a bad compromise in the dispute about voting 
rights. "Although I prefer consensus to conflict, I am not 
scared by the consequences of a crisis, which would be better -- 
experience proves -- than a bad compromise." 
  Conservative MEP's [members of European Parliament] are 
pleading with John Major to find a quick compromise to settle 
the European Union voting crisis and avert what they fear will 
be an electoral disaster at the Euro-elections in June. 
  After a panic-stricken group meeting in Brussels on 
Wednesday 
evening [23 March], they instructed Sir Christopher Prout, their 
leader, to write to the Prime Minister about the dangers of what 
they see as his increasingly negative stance.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
Arrigo Levi at the Foreign Office in London; date not given: 
"Europe's Future in the East"] 
  [Excerpts] The British are not worried about the future of 
democracy in Italy. "We have no such fears," Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd told me when he received me at the Foreign Office. 
"We had a meeting here last week, attended by a number of 
experts, to discuss what could happen in Italy after the 
elections. The conclusion was optimistic. We are all suffering 
from some degree of political malaise. Freed from the fear of 
the Cold War, people are more critical of the political system. 
This applies to Britain and America (consider Ross Perot), 
France and Germany, Spain, Japan, and Italy: There is the same 
feeling that the system must change. But this is no cause for 
alarm. I know Italy, and I know how adaptable and imaginative 
you are. A different system will emerge, and new people, too; 
but I see nobody ready to leap into the saddle of a white 
charger to impose an authoritarian system." 
  Douglas Hurd does know Italy well. He is a former diplomat. 
In fact, the final phase of that career was in Rome, from 1963 
to 1966, before he left the diplomatic service for politics. I 
asked him what advice he would give whatever government is 
formed in Italy after the elections. "I believe," he told me, 
"that the most important task for all of us in this decade is to 
achieve the maximum integration with Central and East Europe. 
And Italy is in a very favorable position in this regard, with 
its formidable experience. This is why, with Foreign Minister 
Andreatta, we proposed initiating a political dialogue with the 
new democracies of the East, even before they join the European 
Union [EU]; and this proposal has been accepted. Italy meets 
all the conditions for performing an important role in all 
fields -- economic, political, strategic. Then there is the 
matter of maintaining good relations with America; both you and 
we are well placed. We must also conduct a good philosophical 
discussion on the future of the EU with a view to the conference 
to revise the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. These are the three 
things on which to concentrate." 
  What about domestic policy? "In domestic policy, the problem 
that worries all of us is the budget. You are in difficulties, 
and so are we. This is why Italy is also eager to reduce the EU 
expenditure (now that it has become a net contributor) -- maybe 
not using the same tone as Mrs. Thatcher, but using similar 
arguments, though Italy is an enthusiastic member of the Union." 
[passage omitted] 
  Most of my conversation with Mr. Hurd was devoted to the 
subject of Europe, once again "in crisis" following the demand 
by London and Madrid that the Council of Minister's voting 
system not be changed -- as all the rest propose --after the 
accession of the four new members: Sweden, Austria, Finland, 
and Norway. London and Madrid are demanding that within the 
Council (in which each of the four major states commands 10 
votes, the rest proportionately fewer, down to Luxembourg's two) 
the "qualified minority" remain 23 votes -- as it is now, out of 
a total of 76 -- instead of increasing to 27, out of the new 
total of 90. That is, they are demanding that two major 
countries plus one minor one (instead of two major and two 
minor) continue to be enough to veto majority decisions on such 
issues as environmental and health policies. This problem, 
though relatively unimportant (in practice no decisions have 
ever been imposed on two major countries), has nevertheless 
created an overheated political atmosphere in Britain, with a 
view to the June European elections. The anti-Europeanist wing 
of the Conservatives are threatening to rebel if Major and Hurd 
yield on the 23-vote qualified majority. For the Major 
government, which is not in good health, a defeat in the 
European elections could prove fatal. So, week after week, a 
decision has been deferred, and there is a danger that the 
enlargement will be deferred, too. 
  I told Hurd that the last time I had been in the room was 
exactly 14 years ago, to interview then Foreign Secretary Lord 
Carrington, in the midst of the crisis sparked by Mrs. Thatcher, 
who "wanted her money back." He was interested to read the 
clipping from THE TIMES which headlined the interview: "Dangers 
of a Family Feud." At that time I asked Lord Carrington whether 
Britain's membership in the Community was in jeopardy; can the 
same question be asked today? "Definitely not," Hurd replied. 
"Nobody now is asking it; our membership is irreversible. We 
have worked on enlargement for so many years, and we certainly 
do not intend to abandon it. But serious matters are at stake, 
such as the ratio between population and the number of votes in 
the Council, and it is better that we do not venture into such 
deep waters and that we leave these matters to the revision 
conference in 1996." 
  Hurd said that the "centralist" vision of such founding 
fathers as De Gasperi and Monnet -- which was valid for making a 
conflict between European countries inconceivable -- is now 
rather dated. "We are witnessing," he said, "a conflict not 
between Europeanists and anti-Europeanists, but between two 
equally Europeanist visions: One is more centralist, while the 
other envisages a central core and a number of different 
structures and sectoral policies that need not involve everyone. 
This variable geometry is possible, as long as there is this 
core, even though we do not all see it the same way and I do not 
know now what we will decide in 1996. We are just at the start 
of a great debate. But it is not only the centralist vision 
that is Europeanist; so too is the other one, that of those who 
do not want national states and parliaments to surrender more 
and more powers to the center and have in mind something more 
difficult but equally European -- a decentralized system based 
on subsidiarity, better suited to the Europe of today." 
  With regard to voting in the Council of Ministers, Hurd 
said: 
"We already have a compromise between different principles, and 
the future system will be a compromise, too. We want to 
conclude the problem over the majority vote quickly. But we 
cannot race ahead while we are still digesting Maastricht: The 
EU has been in existence for only three months. We cannot 
immediately start talking about the next change whenever 
anything changes; and this is not the time for a major 
philosophical debate or to entrust the matter to a committee of 
wise men. This is a problem for the governments to resolve." 
  I reminded Hurd that in a famous speech in the fifties 
Anthony Eden said: "We feel in our bones that we do not belong 
to Europe." Have the bones of the British changed, or are they 
still the same? He replied: "Of course they have changed. Even 
Mrs. Thatcher knew that she was European: Even her bones were 
different from Eden's, because she belonged to a different 
generation. When I attend a Council of Ministers session -- 
which happens rather too often -- I know that this is the right 
place for a British foreign secretary. But we must create a 
Europe in which we all feel comfortable." 
  In our conversation we also discussed Yugoslavia (like 
everyone else, Hurd too feels "anxious and frustrated," but he 
denied that everything has failed: Most of the aid and the blue 
helmets have come from Europe; but it is necessary to improve 
the mechanisms of European foreign and security policy, in which 
he said he is "fully in favor") and Russia. Hurd agrees that 
space must be made for Russia within G-7, by turning it into G-8 
for political matters: "We must be vigilant but open, ready to 
involve the Russians that want to work with us, such as Kozyrev: 
If the Russians are left out, they might not cooperate."

<F P=106> [Article signed CET: "European Union Signs Partnership </F>
Agreement With Ukraine"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 23 Mar (BELGA) -- On Wednesday [23 March], 
the European Union (EU) and Ukraine signed a "partnership 
agreement." Ukraine is the first country belonging to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) with which the EU has 
concluded such an agreement. 
  The partnership agreement could grow into a free trade zone 
between the EU and Ukraine. In 1998 both parties to the 
agreement will examine whether Ukraine has made sufficient 
progress in the direction of a market economy for negotiations 
on a free trade agreement to begin. 
  Our dream and our objective remains to join the EU, 
Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said. Ukraine will launch its 
economic reforms as soon as possible. This year, 30,000 large 
and small companies will be privatized, Zlenko noted. 
  In the partnership agreement, both parties granted each 
other 
most favored nation status. That means that they will award 
each other all the trade benefits that they offer other 
countries. 
  The agreement provides for economic cooperation in highly 
divergent areas, such as industry, investment, public 
procurement contracts, scientific research, intellectual 
property, energy, the environment, transport, 
telecommunications, financial services, regional policy, and 
social cooperation. 
  In the introduction to the agreement it is expressly stated 
that democracy, human rights, and a market economy are the 
essential preconditions for cooperation. 
  The EU is negotiating a similar agreement with Russia. We 
are making good progress, but several problems still have to be 
ironed out, European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said .

Extremist Elements"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 24 Mar (BELGA) -- In a communique issued 
by the Twelve on Thursday [24 March], the European Union [EU] 
condemned ethnic violence in Burundi, blaming all extremist 
elements, whether government supporters, members of the 
opposition, or forces of order. 
  The EU communique stressed: "This violence endangers the 
institutional order in Burundi that has been patiently and 
courageously established by the democratic forces of the 
country." 
  The worsening of the situation in Bujumbura comes as the 
result of confrontation "between certain civil militia and the 
forces of order," the communique notes, adding that this 
violence had resulted in many victims "especially among the 
unarmed and innocent populations of the two ethnic groups." 
  The EU appealed to all sections of Burundi society, urging 
citizens to stop the violence and do everything necessary to 
ensure national reconciliation and to maintain the security of 
all Burundians in the democratic order.

<F P=106> [Press release No. OPSS 52/94 issued by the UK Office of </F>
Public Service and Science: "Review of Government Security 
Completed: Revised Security Classification System Introduced"] 
  [Text] The prime minister, John Major, today announced the 
outcome of a review of the management of security in government 
departments and agencies. This has been conducted against the 
background of recent changes in the nature of the threats to 
government security and the Government's White Paper on Openness. 
  Answering a Parliamentary Question from Mr. Bob Dunn MP for 
Dartford, Mr Major said: 
  "In recent years, the nature of the threats to government 
security has changed. Whilst some of the traditional threats to 
national security may have somewhat reduced, others have not. 
The security of Government is also increasingly threatened by 
for example theft, copying and electronic surveillance, as well 
as by terrorism. 
  ``To ensure that its approach to security reflects current 
threats, the Government has recently completed a review of its 
arrangements for the management of protective security in 
departments and agencies. This has recommended a new protective 
marking system for documents which will help identify more 
precisely those which need protecting, enabling them to be 
protected more effectively according to their value. The new 
system will also be more closely related to the Code of Practice 
on Government Information announced in the Government's White 
Paper on Openness. 
  ``In addition, the review has concluded that existing 
security measures should be examined closely to ensure they are 
necessary in relation to today's threats; that commercially 
available security equipment should be more widely used; and 
that personnel vetting enquiries should be streamlined 
particularly in routine cases. Overall, the aim is to give 
departments and agencies, and management units within them, 
greater responsibility for assessing the nature of the risks 
they face and for making decisions, within a framework of common 
standards of protection, about the security measures they need 
to put in place. Substantial cost savings will result. 
  ``The first stage of the implementation of the proposals of 
this review will be the introduction of a new protective marking 
system with effect from 4 April 1994 alongside the Code of 
Practice on Access to Government Information. The new 
definitions, which will allow fewer Government documents to be 
classified, particularly at the higher levels, are set out 
below. The other elements of the new approach to protective 
security will be put in place in due course.'' 
<H5>  The Four Categories of Protective Marking: Definitions </H5>
  The markings to be allocated to any asset, including 
information, will be determined primarily by reference to the 
practical consequences that are likely to result from the 
compromise of that asset or information. The levels in the new 
protective marking system are defined as follows: 
  TOP SECRET: the compromise of this information or material 
would be likely: to threaten directly the internal stability of 
the UK or friendly countries; to lead directly to widespread 
loss of life; to cause exceptionally grave damage to the 
effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or to the 
continuing effectiveness of extremely valuable security or 
intelligence operations; to cause exceptionally grave damage to 
relations with friendly governments; to cause severe long-term 
damage to the UK economy. 
  SECRET: the compromise of this information or material would 
be likely: to raise international tension; to damage seriously 
relations with friendly governments; to threaten life directly, 
or seriously prejudice public order, or individual security or 
liberty; to cause serious damage to the operational 
effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the 
continuing effectiveness of highly valuable security or 
intelligence operations; to cause substantial material damage to 
national finances or economic and commercial interests. 
  CONFIDENTIAL: the compromise of this information or material 
would be likely: materially to damage diplomatic relations (ie 
cause formal protest or other sanction); to prejudice individual 
security or liberty; to cause damage to the operational 
effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the 
effectiveness of valuable security or intelligence operations; 
to work substantially against national finances or economic and 
commercial interests; substantially to undermine the financial 
viability of major organisations; to impede the investigation or 
facilitate the commission of serious crime; to impede seriously 
the development or operation of major government policies; to 
shut down or otherwise substantially disrupt significant 
national operations. 
  RESTRICTED: the compromise of this information or material

<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  1. The existing protective marking system comprises a 
classification system of four levels relating to national 
security, complemented by a complex range of privacy markings 
(eg COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE, MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE) relevant 
to other sensitive information. These markings will be replaced 
from 4 April 1994 by a single system of protective markings that 
encompasses the whole range of information and other assets held 
by government. 
  2. The definitions on which the current system is based are: 
  --TOP SECRET: "causing exceptionally grave damage to the 
nation" 
  --SECRET: "causing serious injury to the interests of the 
nation" 
  --CONFIDENTIAL: "being damaging to the interests of the 
nation" 
  --RESTRICTED: "being undesirable in the interests of the 
nation" 
  Privacy markings cover lower levels of damage, or harm to 
interests narrower than that of the nation as a whole. 
  3. The new markings retain the same labels as the old 
classifications, but the definitions have been elaborated so as 
to encompass the threats to government information both in 
respect of national security and more widely. They have also 
been defined in terms of the consequences of compromise. This 
makes the definitions less abstract, so that people can better 
decide on the right level of marking for any information. The 
intention is that these markings will serve as a signal to 
indicate the standard of protection that needs to be afforded to 
the information in question. This will help both to drive down 
the amount of information classified, particularly at the higher 
levels, and to encourage the provision of sufficient, but not 
excessive, standards of protection. 
  4. Costs. It is difficult to establish the current costs of 
security in government. Costs are spread widely and impinge on 
a wide range of government activities. However the direct, 
observable costs of security management in government are 
currently estimated at over 300 million pounds a year. Savings 
are expected to arise from the protective marking system 
reducing the amount of material afforded the highest, hence most 
expensive, levels of protection; from enabling departments and 
agencies to put in place what they determine to be the most 
cost-effective protective measures in their own circumstances; 
from a critical review of the value added by existing security 
measures; from making maximum use of industry-standard 
equipment; and from the streamlining of the personnel vetting 
system. 
  5. In addition, it is expected that the implementation of 
the 
review findings will enable contractors employed on classified 
government business to reduce their own security costs and will 
encourage wider competition amongst contractors for classified 
government work.

<F P=106> [Colin Brown report: "Dispute Threatens Huge RAF Order"] </F>
  [Text] Defence ministers are facing a row over the 
replacement for the ageing fleet of RAF Hercules aircraft in one 
of the biggest equipment orders for the Armed Forces. 
  The RAF is seeking to replace the Hercules -- the workhorse 
for the British forces in Bosnia -- with the C130J aircraft 
bought "off-the-shelf" from America in a multi-million pound 
contract. 
  But the Government is under pressure from the aerospace 
industry to support an eight-nation consortium which wants 
British backing for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) project that 
it claims would provide 10,000 British jobs over the next 10 
years. 
  The Commons Select Committee on Defence is expected to throw 
its weight behind the FLA with a report on 30 March calling for 
the RAF Hercules fleet to be refurbished and the FLA consortium, 
known as Euroflag, to be given government backing. 
  Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, threatened 
to resign if Britain pulled out of the European Fighter Aircraft 
[EFA] project, but he has told colleagues he will not resign 
over the FLA project. 
  He is ready to support the RAF. He does not believe a 
replacement for the Hercules has the strategic importance of the 
EFA, a high-technology project, capable of defending Britain 
into the next century. However, buying from the United States 
could upset trade and industry ministers, and open the 
Government to attack from the aerospace industry that it would 
threaten thousands of jobs. Defence ministers are braced for a 
Cabinet row later this year, when a feasibility study is 
completed. 
  British Aerospace, which forms the British part of the FLA 
consortium, is lobbying hard, warning it could damage British 
participation in civil aircraft projects, such as the future 
generation of the Airbus.

  [Text] A German television team (Spiegel-TV) was arrested 
by the Turkish Army in the southeast of Turkey, an area mainly 
inhabited by Kurds, and released after eight hours. 
Correspondents Michael Enger, Corinna Gutstatt, and Hans-Peter 
Weymar said in a telefax sent from Diyarbakir on Thursday [24 
March] that they were blindfolded and taken from near Lice to 
Hazro. Film material and personal notes were forcefully taken 
from them. Their hands were tied behind their backs during 
several interrogations. They were taken to Diyarbakir and 
released that evening. 
  The television crew, which wanted to do a program on the 
Nevruz spring festival last Monday and the municipal elections 
in Turkey next Sunday, had already been attacked once while they 
were filming last Sunday. In their telefax, they also say the 
Turkish Army is continuing its operations against the Kurdish 
civilian population with undiminished violence. Villages are 
systematically destroyed and burned, and people are mistreated, 
killed, and driven out. With the election approaching, violence 
against international observers is becoming increasingly 
widespread, the correspondents say. A Finnish observer 
delegation was also detained for a day.

  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Government wants to conclude 
an internationally binding agreement with Turkey under which 
rioters deported from Germany must not be punished by death. 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said on Westdeutscher 
Rundfunk [radio station] on Thursday [24 March] that he has 
spoken to Foreign Minister Kinkel about negotiating a 
"deportation agreement" with Ankara. In this agreement, the 
Turkish government is to promise that deported Kurds will not 
face death sentences for previous offenses committed in Turkey. 
With such an agreement, which he thinks Ankara will keep, the 
German law on foreigners could be enforced "much more 
intensively," Kanther said. 
  Yekta Guengoer Oezden, president of the Turkish 
Constitutional Court, told DPA in Ankara, that Turkish justice 
guarantees "the right to defense, including the right to look 
for appeal, no less than German law does." If cases of torture 
occur "now and again," the "ignorant persons responsible" are 
tried for undue use of authority and punished, Oezden said. 
Onur Oeymen, Turkey's ambassador to Bonn, speaking on 
Deutschlandfunk radio, confirmed his country's willingness to 
fight terrorists with the means of a constitutional state. 
  In spite of these promises, the church charity Caritas and 
Alliance 90/Greens warned against tightening deportation 
practices. Following the decision by the federal and laender 
governments to use all means of deportation for violent Kurds, 
Caritas President Hellmut Puschmann called on the state to "be 
moderate and renounce revenge." Greens politicians Angelika 
Beer and Claudia Roth demanded that deportations be halted "as 
long as there is no sign of rule of law and human rights in 
Turkey." After the promise not to use any arms from Germany 
against Kurds, everybody knows what Turkish promises are worth.

  [Text] Bonn -- The state secretaries of the federal and 
laender Interior Ministries have agreed to use more severe 
measures against the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), following 
the recent riots. After a three-hour meeting, Kurt Schelter, 
state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry, said on 
Wednesday [23 March] evening that organizations replacing the 
banned PKK should be monitored and prevented with all suitable 
means. 
  Prosecution of the perpetrators is to concentrate on PKK 
ringleaders; demonstrations and marches are to be documented in 
detail; and proceedings for determining membership in a 
terrorist organization are to be instituted. In addition, labor 
exchange bureaus and trade supervisory authorities should search 
for people working illegally in order to deprive the PKK of its 
areas of retreat, Schelter said. All vandals should be deported, 
if possible. 
  The laender interior minister called on the Federal 
Government to ask Ankara to make sure that those deported do not 
face death penalties, torture, or inhuman treatment. The 
laender governed by the Social Democratic Party spoke out for 
halting German arms supplies to Turkey. Bavaria demanded a 
broader definition of breach of the public peace. This offense 
should also be laid down as a compelling reason for deportation 
in the law regarding foreigners.

  [Text] Bavaria's Interior Minister Guenter Beckstein 
(Christian Social Union) has announced amendments to the law 
regarding foreigners, following the latest riots by Kurds. He 
agrees with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union) that breach of the public peace must become an 
imperative reason for deportations in the future, Beckstein said 
in Nuremberg on Wednesday [23 March]. 
  If they commit severe crimes, even asylum-seekers who have 
already been recognized as such must be deported. This is also 
possible without amending the law, because under the Geneva 
Convention these recognized asylum-seekers "impair the country's 
security and have forfeited the right to be admitted." Turkey 
has promised not to threaten those deported with death 
sentences, nor with "inappropriate treatment."

  [Text] The Association of Organizations From Kurdistan 
(KOMKAR) has disassociated itself from the violence committed by 
Kurdish demonstrators in Germany. While these acts may achieve 
welcome effects for the media, they by no means bring about the 
solidarity the Kurds want, the association said in Bonn on 
Wednesday [23 March]. KOMKAR is not associated with the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which has been banned in Germany. 
However, the association spoke out against deporting the 
perpetrators to Turkey: They would fall "directly into the hands 
of the torturers and executioners."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Representatives of the banned Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] associations have put the blame for the 
latest riots and street blockades on the government. Bremen 
lawyer Eberhard Schultz stated to journalists in Bonn on 
Thursday [24 March] that without German arms deliveries to 
Turkey, which have been carried out for many years, the ban of 
the PKK, and the prevention of the Kurdish New Year 
celebrations, there would have been no violent clashes and 
nobody would have been killed or injured. "German policemen are 
always used against the Kurds on behalf of the Turkish military 
regime," Schultz said. 
  The representatives for the Kurds called on the FRG 
Government to rescind the PKK ban. Moreover, it is to refrain 
from deporting Kurdish demonstrators as planned because they are 
threatened by capital punishment in Turkey. Instead, Bonn is to 
advocate a peaceful, political solution of the conflict, it was 
stated.

  [Text] Augsburg -- According to Peter Frisch, deputy 
president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV], the extremist Kurds of the banned Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) receive massive help from the terrorist 
Red Army Faction (RAF). In an interview with AUGSBURGER 
ALLGEMEINE, Frisch said that one must assume that "the PKK gets 
financial, logistical, and personal assistance from RAF 
sympathizers, maybe also from the commando echelon." There have 
been several "solidarity actions" for the PKK by the RAF scene, 
Frisch said.

  [Text] Waren (DPA) -- In the view of Federal Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, the east German economy will grow by 6 
to 8 percent in 1994. There was a 7.1 percent increase last 
year. At the first industrial policy conference of Mecklenburg 
Western Pomerania in Klink, near Waren, Rexrodt said on 
Wednesday [23 March] that this land was one of the regions that 
was going through particularly profound structural changes. 
However, the upward trends were consolidating in the key 
industries of food, agriculture, and shipbuilding. 
  The Federal Government has so far supported this conversion 
with some 17 billion German marks [DM] in subsidies, which has 
helped to create or save a total of 445,000 jobs. According to 
Rexrodt, the Baltic Sea Highway A 20 will make the coastal 
region of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania more attractive to 
investors.

and Hungary are facing an economic upswing, in the view of 
Deutsche Bank Research. In Russia, the other CIS republics, 
Bulgaria, and Romania, on the other hand, the downward slide 
continues, the research subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG writes in 
an interim balance sheet of the reforms in East Europe that was 
presented in Frankfurt on Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Project head Otto Storf stressed that none of the East 
European countries has mastered the process of economic recovery 
-- not even those countries that have made most progress. 
Therefore, the upswing will not follow "a straight line" there, 
either. The Baltic states are on the right path. In almost all 
states the privatization of large companies proves to be 
difficult. However, if the process of improvement is delayed 
further out of concern for rising numbers of unemployed, 
unprofitable economic structures will be conserved. This will 
require all the greater sacrifices later on. At the same time, 
Storf appealed to the European Union to open its markets to the 
reform countries.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The overall expenditure on all the 
public and private social services was more than 1 trillion 
German marks [DM] in 1993 -- DM1,062 billion, to be exact. The 
share of this expenditure in GNP (social services quota) was 
approximately 34 percent. This is reported by the first 
all-German social report, which Labor Minister Norbert Bluem 
(Christian Democratic Union) presented to the Cabinet on Tuesday 
[22 March]. 
  The current increase in the burden of social insurance 
contributions is largely due to the expansion of social 
insurance to all of Germany that resulted from German 
unification, the report says. The transfer payments to eastern 
Germany corresponded to approximately 3 percent in contributions 
to west German social security. About DM118 billion from the 
coffers of pension and unemployment insurance went to the new 
laender between 1991 and 1993. 
  In western Germany the social services quota was 30.3 
percent 
in 1993; in the new laender, however, it was approximately 70 
percent. For 1997 the report predicts a decline in the 
all-German quota to 32 percent. 
  In western Germany the share of social expenditure in GNP 
declined from a record of 33.4 percent in 1981 to 28.9 percent 
in 1991. Most recently it has increased again because of 
improvements in the equalization of burdens for families and 
rising unemployment. In eastern Germany the quota reached its 
record so far in 1992 with 73.1 percent. The number of employed 
people in eastern Germany declined from about 9.9 million in 
1989 to only about 6.1 million in 1993. The number of 
registered unemployed was only 1.15 million in 1993. About 1 
million former GDR citizens have found jobs in western Germany, 
according to the report. 
  The Federal Government's social report has been presented 
irregularly since 1970. The previous report was published in 
June 1990 only for the old laender. At that time social 
expenditure of DM703 billion or 29.4 percent of GNP was 
predicted for all of 1990 in western Germany.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta on Foreign Policy in </F>
Spring Report"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 21 -- Italy's commitment in human 
resources and material and financial means put the nation in the 
front rank of United Nations peacekeeping operations in 1993, 
said Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta who looked back on a 
year of "disturbances and profound changes determined by the 
break-up of the Soviet Union which had not been fully understood 
and absorbed." 
  In the foreign policy section of the annual "Spring Report," 
published by the Euritalia Studies Center, Andreatta opened by 
citing the Italian commitment to a negotiated solution in 
ex-Yugoslavia and to humanitarian assistance to the civilian 
victims of violence there. 
  "Another important aspect of Italy's activities abroad was 
the expansion of relations with the republics which emerged with 
the break-up of the Soviet Union," said the minister who also 
referred to Rome backing for "the process of democratic 
transformation and transition to a market economy" in the 
countries of East and Central Europe. In this connection, the 
minister recalled the joint British-Italian initiative for the 
association of these countries with the political and judiciary 
pillars written into the European Union's [EU] Maastricht Treaty. 
  Italy now holds the rotating presidency of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), an organization with 
a role, he stressed, in the prevention of conflict and the 
management of crisis situations. 
  On another front, Andreatta said his nation has "actively 
contributed" to European integration and pointed out the 
importance of work aimed at forging ties between common foreign 
and defense policy and the expansion of the EU. He went on to 
recall the development of the Western European Union, of which 
Italy held the rotating presidency last year, as "a component of 
EU defense (and) an instrument for strengthening the European 
pillar" of NATO. In this area, the minister underscored the 
activities of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the 
Partnership for Peace proposal for military cooperation between 
NATO and the nations of East Europe. 
  On the Italian role in Somalia last year, Andreatta said the 
country "expressed concern from the very beginning on an 
excessive accent on the military instrument with regard to the 
political goals and humanitarian objectives" of the UN mission. 
  He also referred to "the steady commitment of Italy to 
support the peace process" in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Chairman of Anti-Mafia Committee </F>
Resigns"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 23 -- The chairman of the Italian 
parliament's Anti-Mafia Committee Luciano Violante resigned here 
today in order to avoid what he described as "shadows" being 
cast on the committee's investigations in the last eighteen 
months into links between organised crime, businessmen, and 
politicians. 
  Violante, a member of the Democratic Party of the Left, came 
under heavy fire from parties and spokesmen on the right of the 
political spectrum after the Turin daily, LA STAMPA, published 
remarks in which he reportedly claimed the managing-director of 
TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Publitalia advertising arm, 
Marcello Dell'Utri was under investigation by the Catania public 
prosecutor's office for Mafia ties in a case involving arms and 
drugs trafficking. 
  The prosecutor's office denied the claim yesterday with a 
less than categorical statement, which deplored press leaks and 
voiced "surprise, alarm and disappointment" over publication of 
news which "should it prove true, would definitely jeopardise 
investigations." 
  This afternoon, Berlusconi was meeting here with President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in his role as president of the Superior 
Council of the Magistrature, the body through which the 
judiciary governs its affairs, to end what the media 
mogul-turned-politician called "this provocation against the 
liberty of the Italians." 
  Reports that Dell'Utri has been named by Cosa Nostra 
supergrass Salvatore Cancemi in connection with organised crime 
activities have been legion in recent days, and there was court 
testimony from the late 1980's in which he was linked to Mafia 
figures. 
  LA STAMPA's confirmation of its printed version of the 
remarks in which Violante is quoted as asking the journalist not 
to print some of his more flippant observations was greeted by 
Berlusconi's conservative Go Italy party as triumphant 
confirmation of a "Communist plot" to prevent the Right from 
winning the imminent elections. 
  Other conservatives joined the chorus, most of them arguing 
that Violante, who said yesterday evening he was meditating 
resignation as an "act of conscience," should step down because 
his remarks may have represent a breach of the judicial secret. 
  Informed judicial sources said that the name that had in 
fact 
occurred in the investigations was that of Alberto Dell'Utri, 
Marcello's twin brother, who apparently cropped up during 
telephone taps on the conversations of organised crime figures. 
  Violante told journalists that it was the LA STAMPA reporter 
who had mentioned the Catania investigations to him, then 
putting the remarks into his mouth. He also said he had asked 
his lawyers to start legal proceedings, claiming he had been 
"trapped." 
  Today, Violante's letter pointed out that, "beyond their 
party membership and political opinion," during his chairmanship 
at the Anti-Mafia Committee, all the committee members, who come 
from both houses of parliament, gave their full cooperation to 
enquiries that had for the first time elucidated the nexus 
between organised crime, business interests and politicians. 
"Consolidated equilibriums have been upset," he told the 
speakers of the two houses of parliament. "A start has been made 
to ascertaining responsibilities never identified before, and 
hitherto concealed collusions have become public and have been 
made evident. Whence the attempt to strike back, using every 
means and with the aim of delegitimising this work. The trap 
was sprung on a lie, and the attack is built on lies, using the 
contingency of the elections beyond any acceptable limit." 
  Chatting with journalists, Violante claimed one should have 
"strong doubts" about the whole of the power system from which 
the attack against him and the Anti-Mafia Committee were coming: 
"When the first Mafia trials started, there was talk of plots. 
When a certain type of power is questioned and brought back in 
line with the law, there are shouts of a plot because it needs 
illegality." 
  He also said he had received hundreds of messages of 
support, 
not least from the families of police and magistrates slain by 
the Mafia, adding that he was also acting in defence of his own 
personal values. 
  Now 52, Violante has been on leave from his job as a judge 
since 1979 when he first won election to the Lower House for the 
Italian Communist Party after working as an assistant prosecutor 
in Turin, handling mostly terrorist cases. 
  For his thirteen years in parliament, he has been a leading 
voice in the national debate on judicial affairs and played a 
direct role in moves in parliamentary enquiries to uncover the 
Gladio stay-behind operation, earning violent criticism from 
then President Francesco Cossiga who on one occasion described 
him as "the Italian Vyshinskiy." But the work that has taken 
most of his attention and projected him firmly into the public 
eye when he became the Anti-Mafia Committee's chairman has been 
organised crime. 
  He was a major force behind approval of legislation on Mafia 
association and in support of witness protection programmes for 
Mafia state's witnesses. The Anti-Mafia Committee's reports on 
the links between organised crime, politicians and business were 
approved by a large majority. 
  Even though he denied alleging that Berlusconi has any 
direct 
responsibility in it, Violante said he sees a "general strategy 
to delegitimise... my work and the commission's." "My 
impression is that the nucleus of interests collected round Go 
Italy is in deep continuity with the system of power that in the 
past caused so much mourning and so much damage in Italy," he 
added. 
  In other remarks, he described the remarks published by LA 
STAMPA as a "pseudo-interview" and told reporters to refer to 
his denial. 
  He also repeated that his resignation was not capitulation 
to 
the charges against him, but was to avoid charges of partiality 
being advanced against the Anti-Mafia Committee and its work.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Campaign"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 21 -- Italian People's Party 
leader Mino Martinazzoli promised today that if the center wins 
the general election Sunday and Monday [27 and 28 March] the 
nation will have a new government within 24 hours as Achille 
Occhetto, whose Democratic Party of the Left is the mainstay of 
the Progressive Coalition, promised "no idleness and luxury" if 
the left is victorious but "sacrifices equitably shared." 
  On the right, the chairman of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest 
group, Fedele Confalonieri, lashed out against the press for 
coverage of alleged complicity between his group and Sicilian 
Mafia families while an ally of Berlusconi's Forza Italia 
movement, neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] leader 
Gianfranco Fini, defended national unity and vowed never to 
recant Fascism. 
  With four days left in the campaign leading to the crucial 
vote, Martinazzoli, who steered his Christian Democrats through 
a name-change in mid-January, lashed out at the right and left 
on national television in describing Occhetto as "politically 
somewhat spherical" and Berlusconi as having "a natural aptitude 
for lying, the political vision of an abacus and the thinking of 
an imbecile." 
  Fini, said the party leader, is a person a used car could 
not 
be sold to "because he wouldn't pay for it" and Umberto Bossi, 
whose Northern League is in the Forza Italia camp, as "a big 
talker." 
  Another voice from the center today was that of Mario Segni, 
who dismissed all prospects of his Pact for Italy entering a 
government with the Democratic Party of the Left after the 
election. Segni, a reforming Christian Democrat who quit the 
Catholic party before the name change, also said that though 
surveys are banned, "we all have the sensation that this week we 
are strongly recovering because reason is beginning to replace 
emotion and sentiment." 
  On this score, Democratic Alliance, a grouping of left-wing 
intellectuals running on the progressive ticket, announced a 
petition drive which has garnered more than 2,000 signatures led 
by Nobel medicine price laureate Rita Levi Montalcini, conductor 
Claudio Abbado, theatrical director and entrepreneur Giorgio 
Strehler and figures of this caliber. 
  In Milan today, Confalonieri told a press conference, "We 
are 
outraged, if only for a lack of a better word." The conference 
had been called to answer allegations made, and highlighted by 
the press, that Fininvest executives, including Berlusconi who 
owns Fininvest, had been fingered by Mafia turncoats for wrong 
doing. 
  Fini, a guest on a Fininvest television channel talk show, 
said of Berlusconi's ally in the north, "I don't talk to Bossi 
because I think he doesn't understand. He insults, I try 
reason." On Berlusconi, the neofascist leader said, there is no 
problem. "When I sign an understanding, I respect it," he added 
with reference to his National Alliance deal with the 
businessman turned politician. 
  Questioned by a left-wing journalist on his position on 
Fascism, Fini said, "If you are asking me to forsake it, I will 
never do this. If you tell me to look ahead, that's what I'm 
doing. History will be the judge of Fascism." 
  On the stump in Parma, Occhetto told a rally, "Do not 
believe 
in a magic wand and those who say they will create a million 
jobs." If the progressives win, there will be no idleness and 
luxury around the corner because the country has been unnerved 
in recent years, destroyed. "Sacrifices, however, will have to 
be equally shared and will especially have to be made by those 
who have never done so," he declared. Looking to the right, he 
said, "In Europe, they laugh when they hear it said he 
(Berlusconi) entered the field to weaken the communist peril." 
  If the right wins and Berlusconi becomes premier, he added, 
"I will ask myself of what use was Bribesville; the poor would 
have to restore to the wealthy of Bribesville the wealth (the 
corrupt) should now return to justice," he said with reference 
to his proposal to make those in possession of ill-got gains 
reimburse the state. 
  In another development today, the Italian Episcopal 
Conference branded the mass media as "one of the strongest 
factors in the de-Christianization process and the eclipse of 
human values themselves" and told Italy's Catholics going to the 
polls to turn away from "high-sounding words which hide lack of 
content." 
  After admitting that the political unity of the nation's 
Catholics is a thing of the past, the bishops said the faithful 
should, nonetheless, be mindful of the moral requirements 
attached to the Church's social doctrine when casting their 
ballots.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Police Seek Forza Italia </F>
Candidate List"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 23 -- Police from the Digos 
political division this morning went to the Rome national 
headquarters of the Forza Italia (Go Italy) party of media 
tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, to request a list of their candidates 
for this Sunday [27 March] and Monday's general elections, on a 
request from Palmi Assistant Prosecutor Maria Grazia Omboni, 
Forza Italia attorney Cesare Preveti said. 
  (The prosecutor, who is heading an investigation into 
illegal 
activities by certain free mason lodges in Calabria, refused to 
confirm or deny the request while another assistant prosecutor, 
Carlo Macri, said in Palmi that he knew nothing of a request for 
the Forza Italia document and "if this is true, then it is very 
serious that I don't know anything".) 
  Previti, who is also a candidate for the upcoming vote, told 
the press how the requested list had "naturally" been given to 
the Digos police "...but I must add how it had also been 
registered with the Ministry of the Interior and so, if one 
wanted to avoid such a spectacular scene, they (Digos) needed 
only file a request with the ministry." 
  The Forza Italia attorney went on to express his surprise 
for 
such an initiative, also in light of the polemics yesterday over 
insinuation made, and later denied, by the chairman of 
Parliament's Anti-Mafia Commission, Luciano Violante, that 
Berlusconi's party had links with the Mafia to which Berlusconi 
filed a complaint of bias to the speakers of the Houses, 
demanding that Violante he suspended from his institutional post. 
  Asked whether he thought the sending of the Digos to Forza 
Italia headquarters was part of a "single design" against the 
party, Previti said "this is a maneuver orchestrated by the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], if Violante is a member of the 
PDS leadership, against us." 
  He then added "First they tried to link us with the Mafia, 
and now with the Free Masons, let's see who we'll be linked with 
in the next couple of days."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article:"Two Sicilian Magistrates Arrested by </F>
Calabria Judges"] 
  [Text] Reggio Calabria, 19 Mar (ANSA) -- The former chief 
justice on the Messina bench, Antonio La Torre, and the 
magistrate in charge of the court of surveillance in the 
Sicilian port city across the straits from this city on the 
southern mainland, Francesco Mancuso, have been arrested and 
charged with corruption and fraudulent judiciary practices, 
Carabinieri police confirmed today. 
  Late yesterday, Carabinieri police acted on 12 preventive 
custody warrants issued by magistrates in Reggio Calabria in 
charge of the investigation into the Messina judges and 
unidentified businessmen and Mafia gangsters opened last year. 
The investigation, still under way, is based on testimony 
provided by organized crime figures in custody who have turned 
state's evidence. 
  The charges against La Torre, in retirement since December 
last year, refer to his work when he was an assistant judge on 
the Messina criminal appeals court. Judiciary sources said 
today La Torre was allegedly corrupted by Messina Mafia clans in 
exchange for issuing light sentences from the criminal court 
bench and that Mancuso is thought to have worked to the benefit 
of gangsters while they were detained. 
  In addition to the word of informants, said these sources, 
the Reggio Calabria magistrates also possess documents 
pertaining to the charges. 
  Aside from the Messina judges, arrested in their homes, two 
of the 12 warrants could not be served because they were issued 
for known Mafia figures still at large. Six others were 
delivered in jail to suspected members of Messina Mafia families.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italians More Optimistic for </F>
Post-Election Recovery"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 24 -- Italians are generally 
optimistic over the prospects for an economic recovery in the 
six months following the upcoming political elections, according 
to a poll carried out by the CIRM [Italian Center for Market 
Research] research institute for the KNIGHT RIDDER FINANCIAL 
news agency. 
  Based on selected interviews with 848 persons, representing 
48 million Italians over 18 years of age, CIRM found that 48 
percent felt that the economic situation will improve over the 
next six months, while only a week ago a similar poll showed 
only 39 percent so optimistic. This was slightly offset by 21 
percent who thought the economic situation would get worse. 
  While optimistic over the economy in general, Italians 
remained less optimistic over their own family budgets with 52 
percent of those interviewed, against 60 percent a week ago, 
expecting no change for their personal budgets, although the 
percentage of optimists rose from 27 percent last week to 34 
percent in the more recent poll. The number of those expecting 
things to get worse remained at 14 percent. 
  On more political matters, the CIRM poll showed how a 
growing 
number of people see the formation of a coalition government, 
one of the two poles plus outside forces, with 61 percent 
holding this view compared to 54 percent a week ago. 
  According to 28 percent of those interviewed, however, it 
will take between one to three months to forge a new executive, 
while 23 percent thought it may take more than three months, 
compared to 29 percent last week. 
  The die-hard optimists, who saw a new government in less 
than 
a month, accounted for 12 percent of those interviewed, while 19 
percent saw no hope for a government and thus new elections. 
  The general uncertainty over the political-economic 
situation 
was also reflected in how Italians treat their money with many 
preferring temporary "parking" investment until a new political 
scenario and guarantee greater security and opportunity. 
  According to the CIRM poll, in fact, 42 percent of those 
interviewed said they held checking accounts, 22 percent held 
state bonds, 19 percent were home owners, 15 percent invested in 
mutual funds and 13 percent in the stock market. 
  The CIRM poll also found how 46 percent of those 
interviewed, 
against 52 percent a week ago, did not expect to be spending 
more, while those seeing their spending on the upswing rose from 
28 percent to 33 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Allies for Alitalia Yet, Schisano </F>
Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Hamburg, March 22 -- Roberto Schisano, the 
new managing director of the Italian flagship airline, Alitalia, 
on Tuesday [22 March] indicated he preferred not to seek 
international alliances at the moment, and perhaps not even 
after the company's finances have improved. 
  "Is it better for an investor to be a shareholder in a 
profit-making regional airline or in a loss-making international 
group?" Schisano replied to reporters who asked him about his 
opinion on the ever growing merger trend in the airline industry. 
  Schisano, who was recruited to the ailing public airline 
from 
Texas Instruments on January 27, gave reporters an outline of 
his own restructuring plan, after stating three weeks ago he was 
willing to review a different plan drawn up by his predecessors 
and rejected by the trade unions. Schisano said he wants to 
bring Alitalia toward a balanced budget in one year and does not 
want to think about alliances with other carriers until finances 
are in the black. This is possible only by increasing 
efficiency, cutting per unit production costs and building an 
Alitalia terminal at Milan's international airport to combat 
increasingly aggressive foreign competition. 
  "The review of the new plan will be completed by the end of 
April, the plan will go into effect immediately and should show 
its first results in one year," Schisano claimed. 
  But until then, he stressed, it is inappropriate to talk 
about international alliances: "Where I come from," he said, 
referring to Texas Instruments, "there were no sister companies, 
only competitors, and competitors must be treated as such. 
Partnerships can exist only if there are reciprocal interests 
but Alitalia is in no condition to choose a partner." 
  Schisano also said he had no objections to the privatization 
of Alitalia but he stressed the importance of increasing the 
company's advantage at the Milan airport. "All of northern 
Italy is a strategic market and for years now has been invaded 
by tough European competitors. Because it does not have a 
terminal in Lombardy, Alitalia has been losing two million 
passengers a year in the country's most industrialized area. 
That's three billion lire a day up in smoke, or one trillion 
lire in revenues every year." 
  He invoked "political" decisions to get the terminal 
project, 
dubbed Malpensa 2000, moving again after a massive kickbacks 
scandal virtually blocked development. The plan includes 
transportation links between the airport and Milan. "I've been 
hearing talk about this for the last thirty years and nothing's 
been done yet," he added. 
  Schisano earlier this month promised to pay the wage 
increases that were frozen by the former CEO [chief executive 
officer], Giovanni Bisignani, and to review the controversial 
restructuring plan. He also said Alitalia, which is owned by 
the public group, IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], 
has "such severe internal problems" that it may not be able to 
exploit chances of recovery. He told unions however that this 
does not mean that the general guidelines of the first 
restructuring plan will be overhauled, but rather that the 
general climate of "demotivation" and "disarray" among personnel 
must be changed. 
  The unions rejected the restructuring plan drawn up by the 
previous company management and approved by the IRI board. But 
new management, put in place in a major top-end reshuffle in 
January, has claimed it does not want industrial relations to 
degenerate further. 
  Alitalia is expected to post 400 billion lire (238 million 
dollars) in losses and debts of two trillion lire (1.19 billion 
dollars) for 1993, following first-half losses of 214 billion 
lire (127.3 million dollars) reported in September. 
  Schisano has not replied to union requests to make company 
shares available to employees and has not denied plans to cut 
between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs. Alitalia wants to place some 800 
workers into early retirement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bahattin Gunel, acting chairman of the </F>
pro-Kurdish Democratic Party of Turkey, by Maggie Maxton; place 
and date not given: "Our Candidates Are Threatened With Murder 
and Kidnapping"] 
  [Text] [Maxton] Mr. Gunel, what made you, a Turk, want to 
get involved in the Democracy Party [DEP]? 
  [Gunel] As a socialist, I am sure the right thing to do is 
to solve our country's problems on a legal democratic level 
within the framework of a party like ours. The DEP was founded 
on 7 May 1993. Since that day it has been attempting to pursue 
a policy based on the following principles: 
  1. The party recognizes that the Kurdish people have been 
defamed, persecuted, and exploited as part of official ideology 
for 70 years, and that the Kurdish problem must be solved in a 
democratic, peaceful, and legal manner. I do not think there 
can be any democracy and human rights without a solution to the 
Kurdish problem in this country. 
  2. Ever since the Ottoman Empire, democracy has never been 
practiced as a way of life in Turkey. But we want to practice 
it. 
  3. The party is aimed at putting an end to the increasing 
exploitation of the working class and working people. Just as 
with the HEP [People's Labor Party], the DEP also sees a link 
between the national democratic struggle of the Kurdish people 
and the economic and political struggle of the working class. 
Therefore the DEP is in favor of the unity of all democratic 
forces, and is of the opinion that the various problems can only 
be solved when taken together. Even so, we are often presented 
as a single party that acts exclusively for the sake of the 
Kurdish question. 
  Since the formation of the HEP, the Turkish state at last 
has 
a party that opposes official ideology without hesitation. The 
parties that consider themselves leftist have never consistently 
opposed the repressive policy that intimidates the Kurds. The 
state realized that the HEP would mark the beginning of a new 
era, and it attempted to strangle the new movement. One method 
of doing so was to confront us in the media with the "specter" 
of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and isolate us from the 
remaining circles, from the progressive left, democratic forces, 
and working class. 
  The local government elections of 27 March at last gave our 
party the opportunity to present our policy directly to the 
people. But the state had already prepared its own strategy. 
First, the chief of the General Staff informed the political 
leadership that the preconditions for holding the elections were 
missing in the east and southeast of the country, and that, 
therefore, the elections should be abandoned in those areas. 
But they failed to convince the politicians, because the 
discontinuation of the elections in the provinces would have 
constituted a state weakness, showing that the state no longer 
had any control over a certain part of the country. Therefore 
the politicians refused. 
  [Maxton] It would also have shown once again that this part 
of the country is virtually divided. 
  [Gunel] Yes. The second method against us was our exclusion 
from the elections. We had started a peace campaign. Because 
of a declaration that our Central Executive Council had adopted 
during the election campaign, court action to ban our party was 
commenced, with this action having no basis in existing 
legislation. The purpose of this was to disband the party and 
found a new one. At the same time, our supporters were supposed 
to think that we would not be able to take part in the elections 
because of our termination and turn to other parties. 
  But because even this was not enough and the DEP announced 
that it would take part in the elections in spite of everything, 
a third method was utilized. Mainly in the east and southeast, 
the chairmen and members of all our regional subcommittees were 
pressured to resign. We have documents and letters from the 
chief of staff to party members, chairmen, and ordinary members 
containing threats of murder and kidnapping. When election 
candidates stepped forward despite these threats, goverment 
people went to each village in which we could expect to gain 
votes and threatened to burn down the entire village if we won 
the elections, or to kill one man for each vote cast in our 
favor. 
  Despite everything, we said that we would take part in the 
elections, even if it meant winning few votes. But on the night 
after we had presented our candidate to the public, on 13 
February, 320 of our candidates, including the candidate for the 
mayorship of Diyarbakir, were arrested. They were not only 
tortured, but also threatened with death if they maintained 
their candidacies. 
  Finally, highly explosive charges were laid at our district 
offices in Mamak and Yenimahalle, the provincial office, and our 
party headquarters. The explosion attempt occurred at a time 
when two parliamentary deputies, two acting chairmen, and two 
acting general secretaries were present. This was a deliberate 
attempt to kill them. Apart from that, an attempt was made on 
the life of our general secretary at 01:30 in the morning. He 
was lucky to have survived. 
  [Maxton] The DEP had trouble finding candidates. Does that 
apply to all provinces in varying degrees? How many candidates 
did you want to have, and how many did you find? 
  [Gunel] We had problems almost everywhere. I think the DEP 
could have found at least 15 to 20 candidates everywhere. Even 
the state and Turkish public opinion know that no party would be 
successful in the provinces apart from the DEP. 
  [Maxton] How many candidates did you manage to find under 
the conditions in force? 
  [Gunel] We had 70 mayor candidates for the large urban 
centers. Together with the smaller districts, we had a total of 
390 candidates. Under normal conditions we would have had 380 
candidates for the large centers and 1,800 candidates for city 
councillors instead of the normal 800. The candidates who were 
too scared to campaign thought not only of their own lives, but 
also of the lives of their children and relatives, and of the 
danger that their villages might have been burned. 
  [Maxton] How many candidates do not actually belong to the 
DEP? For instance, the candidate for mayor of Diyarbakir is not 
a DEP member. 
  [Gunel] About half the candidates do not belong to the 
party. Our method of selecting candidates differs from that of 
other parties. Our candidates were selected by the party 
headquarters, but on the recommendations of local party 
organizations, even taking the will of the local populace into 
consideration. We found seven candidates for the post of mayor 
of Diyarbakir, including the chairman of the Medical Council and 
a member of the Chamber of Genetic Engineers. Diyarbakir has a 
Democratic Platform consisting of 42 groups and societies who 
pursue politics at a distance from the parties. The Democratic 
Platform, in collusion with the local population, suggested the 
director of the Emlak Bank as a candidate, and we accepted him. 
  [Maxton] On 16 or 17 September some mayors went over to 
the DEP, so the DEP had mayors for the first time. Were they 
able to bring about an understanding of communal politics, or 
were they not even given the chance to do so? 
  [Gunel] Our friends had no chance whatsoever of presenting 
our communal policy. From the day they transferred to the DEP, 
their private houses and village halls were fired upon, and they 
themselves were arrested or interrogated. Not a single one of 
our mayors was able to sit in his office for as much as one day. 
One of them was the mayor of Lice, whose office was destroyed. 
The mayors of Silvan and Kozluk were immediately taken into 
police custody. 
  Apart from that, since transferring to the DEP, our mayors 
have not received a single penny in financial support from the 
state. The mayor of Kozluk said recently that whereas the other 
mayors had already received their payments for 1995, he had not 
even received some of the money he was owed in 1992. Therefore 
we have no chance of offering financial support. In any case, 
the population of this region is no longer so concerned about 
support, they are more concerned about staying alive without 
being murdered, tortured, or expelled. So we do have a communal 
political program for the region, but we have not been able to 
implement it yet. 
  [Maxton] The SHP [Democratic Populist Party], which differs 
from your party on several points, is pursuing a similar policy 
of decentralization and democratization. Are you holding talks 
on this subject? 
  [Gunel] As far as declarations are concerned, even the ANAP 
[Motherland Party] is proceeding the same way we are. One can 
even say that ANAP is further ahead in this respect. But I very 
much doubt if these parties have much respect for the protection 
of human rights. When someone deprives someone else of his 
natural right, the right to life, how can he then say "man's 
water should be pure and his streets clean?" The protection of 
life comes first. Only then can one do something about living 
standards. 
  [Maxton] Were there negative reactions to the DEP's decision 
to withdraw for the elections? Originally there was merely talk 
of withdrawing from the elections in Kurdistan. 
  [Gunel] On the contrary, the general impression is that the 
reactions were positive. Even those who at first wanted to vote 
SHP are now saying that they woid vote for us as a protest 
against the arrests. I think we are capable of influencing 60 
percent of our electorate. The remaining 40 percent will vote 
differently through fear of punishment. Even in this phase we 
will have little chance of publicity. But when we do reach our 
voters, I think they will all either boycott the election or 
deliberately cast invalid votes. On 9 March, our party congress 
will decide what to do next, and the party organizations will 
comply with what has been decided. 
  I think this protest will be effective, and that we will 
succeed in convincing Turkish and international public opinion 
that these elections are illegitimate. The illegitimacy of the 
elections will be a subject of discussion from the very first 
month onward, and Turkish public opinion will become 
increasingly convinced that they are not legitimate, not only 
because of the persecution, but also because the DEP is the only 
party that can legitimately lend political expression to the 
situation of the Kurdish people. If the DEP cannot take part in 
the elections, then they cannot be legitimate elections. 
  [Maxton] A debate has been going on inside the DEP for a 
long time now on whether or not the party should take part in 
the elections on account of the persecution. For a long time, 
the majority believed the DEP should take part. What national 
or international organizations have you requested support from 
in holding free elections? What assistance has been offered you? 
  [Gunel] When the General Staff issued the first statements 
that the preconditions for holding the elections were missing, 
and later when the DEP was barred from the elections, and later 
still when all the other parties united against the DEP, we 
realized that we were facing very undemocratic measures against 
us. But we still hoped for a change during the election period. 
In addition to issuing a resolution to take part in the 
elections, our party congress called upon both sides to 
introduce a cease-fire at least during the elections. 
  [Maxton] But as far as I know, this appeal for a cease-fire 
hardly appeared in the press, except in the pro-Kurdish paper 
GUNDEM. 
  [Gunel] It received a brief mention in CUMHURIYET and 
AYDINLIK. Although we are acquainted with the right-oriented 
structures of the state, we still believed that a cease-fire 
would occur. However we decided that we would pull out of the 
elections on 26 March if the state continued with its 
persecution, murders, and threats. All the same, we have made 
all the preparations to take part in the elections, providing 
everything -- flags, loudspeakers, and handouts, even buses. 
  [Maxton] The DEP Deputy Sirri Sakik is supposed to have 
said on 3 March: "We have withdrawn from the elections in order 
to protect our people." Following the DEP decision to withdraw 
form the elections, the PKK announced that it agreed with the 
DEP decision and called for an election boycott. Now, election 
boycotts are illegal in Turkey. Will there not be harsh 
measures against those who do not turn out to vote, especially 
in the Kurdish areas? How will your people be protected then? 
  [Gunel] Further developments are yet to be discussed. But I 
can already say that we do not consider it expedient to take 
part in illegitimate elections. But in any case we will seek 
paths of action that are not harmful, and we will put pressure 
on people not to vote if such pressure might be harmful to them. 
The PKK is a different party with different methods and reaches 
its decisions according to its own political perception. 
  [Maxton] You will probably find it very difficult to 
influence the state, but you might be able to make an appeal to 
the PKK through the media or some other channel. 
  [Gunel] No, in fact it is very difficult for us to make 
contact with the PKK. But in the cities we are organized as a 
legal party within the framework of the law in force, and 
theoretically we should have access to the state. In any case 
that is our duty, and we are doing our best to make the state 
see our way of thinking. On the other hand, the PKK, with its 
methods of action, has completely outlawed itself from the 
system, and makes its own decisions internally, quite 
independently of the state or other institutions. As part of our 
peace campaign and in connection with the elections, we have 
called on both sides to cease fire, telling them that the 
bloodshed must stop and a peaceful solution must be found. We 
actually approached both sides with our message, and for this 
very reason a court action has been undertaken against us, on 
the grounds that we are equating the state with the PKK. Had we 
known what would happen, we would have addressed the appeal only 
to the state! 
  [Maxton] Soon after the DEP began to explain to the public 
why it felt obliged to withdraw from the elections because of 
the persecution, the PKK renewed its threats against Turkish 
parties. Does that have a negative effect on the DEP's attitude? 
  [Gunel] The PKK has its criteria for judging what is to the 
advantage of the Kurds and what is to their disadvantage, and is 
of the opinion that the struggle is to their advantage. I am 
not saying whether or not that is correct, but whenever you have 
asked us, as DEP members, about the kidnapping of journalists 
and the PKK resolution about the banning of parties, we have 
always said that existing problems cannot be resolved by the use 
of force, but only by political means. 
  [Maxton] But that segment of public opinion that sympathizes 
with the Kurds has not received any positive influence. 
  [Gunel] The segments of Turkish and international society 
that sympathize with us have never really tried to understand 
us. The state and our own problems and deficiencies have 
prevented us from expressing ourselves properly. But society has 
also failed to inquire whether we are really the way the state 
makes us out to be. We have always been viewed in a biased 
manner either as a Kurdish party or as a legal branch of the 
PKK. If society considers our declarations correct, it should 
cease making its solidarity with us dependent on the PKK's 
conduct. It should criticize the PKK directly, not us. 
  [Maxton] The state's intimidation of the DEP is well-known 
and documented. On the one hand, the state is calling upon the 
Kurds to defend their rights not with force, but through 
democratic methods; on the other hand, almost every single 
Kurdish organization and institution has been closed. In the 
end, on 2 March even the parliamentary immunity of the seven 
Kurdish deputies was abolished. That shows that the state does 
not give the Kurds much of an opportunity for political 
expression. 
  [Gunel] We in the DEP have always believed that despite all 
intimidation, problems must be resolved by political means and 
legally. But how much longer will this be possible if sooner or 
later all the people who share this principle are wiped out or 
pressured into thinking differently? There will be a demand to 
lift the parliamentary immunity of remaining deputies. So far, 
75 of our party colleagues have been murdered, but we have not 
given up. Even if all our deputies or we ourselves are in 
prison, it is still expedient to continue at this level. But 
that only applies as long as we are not used as a label like 
Kurdish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and as long as we are 
able to propose our own solutions. As long as these 
possibilities of action have not been taken away from us, we 
will continue on our course. 
  [Maxton] Several new voices have recently made themselves 
heard inside the SHP, which until recently was not very 
positively rated as a part of the government. SHP chairman 
Karayalcin discovered, somewhat late, the existence of 
depopulated villages and mentioned the danger of a "putsch by 
civilian forces." Apart from that, almost every single SHP 
deputy voted against lifting the parliamentary immunity of the 
Kurdish deputies. Do you think this signifies a certain 
breakthrough? 
  [Gunel] Right now Turkey is experiencing the greatest 
economic and political crisis in its history. If a coalition of 
parties that represent apparently opposite political streams, 
Left and Right, is built, the resultant force can then be teamed 
up with the government in order to contain the Kurdish problem 
and the problems of democracy at least for a while. In view of 
the urgency of the problems, it has not been possible to prevent 
daily demands from receiving loud publicity. The daily costs of 
the war cannot be borne by the budget. They worsen the economic 
crisis and cause a deterioration in the economic situation of 
poor people. Apart from that, the war is limiting the effect of 
democracy. 
  In view of all this, lifting parliamentary immunity can be 
viewed as no more than the drop that has caused the barrel to 
overflow. We are mainly concerned with the economic costs of a 
dirty war that is being waged allegedly "in defense of the 
state, democracy, and the people." 
  [Maxton] What information do you have about the current 
situation of the arrested deputies? 
  [Gunel] As far as we know, they have not been subjected to 
physical torture yet. But they are surely under psychological 
torture, and we also consider ourselves to be under such 
torture. The very arrest of these deputies and the fact that 
they have been deprived of their belts, shoelaces, and ties, as 
though they would commit suicide, plus the allegations (since 
denied by diplomatic sources) that some of them applied for 
political asylum abroad -- all this is a deliberate insult that 
we view as a form of psychological torture upon us. Other 
things might also be happening, suggested by the fact that our 
deputies have not been allowed to issue statements to the police. 
  If Tansu Ciller weeps before the eyes of the entire 
population, it shows how much pressure is being brought to bear 
against her. We have no way of knowing how this pressure is 
applied, and by whom. Perhaps Tansu Ciller thinks that she 
behaved incorrectly under this pressure, and that she might be 
subjected to more of it. 
  We must observe coming developments. World public opinion, 
which until now has judged events in Turkey in a biased manner, 
through the eyes of the Turkish authorities, seems to be 
reconsidering its attitude and is trying to make a contribution 
to democracy in Turkey. We are doing our best to remain calm 
despite all the intimidation, and will never resort to violent 
methods of solving problems. But if the state's pressure 
increases, we cannot assume any responsibility for future 
developments. 
  [Maxton] What exactly do you expect from the Turkish parties 
on the one hand, and European governments, parties, and 
organizations on the other hand? 
  [Gunel] Because we were already aware of these dangers, we 
have been telling Turkish human rights associations, trade 
unions, and democratic organizations, as well as European 
governments and human rights organizations, to send observers to 
monitor elections in Turkey. We know that delegations of 
observers are already being formed in Europe. But parliamentary 
speaker Cindoruk, who normally appears as a democrat, considered 
the sending of observers as an insult to "democratically 
governed" Turkey. Even in Turkey delegations of observers have 
been formed. 
  Now that we, the DEP, cannot take part in the elections, 
they 
have lost their legitimacy. With this opinion we wish to make a 
contribution to democratization, and we hope that European 
governments and organizations will also call for a cease-fire, 
an end to the bloodbath, and a peaceful democratic solution. 
  We do not want individuals to receive protection. We have 
begun to act at a legal political level, even though we know the 
risks involved. Even today we do not fear trials, arrests, and 
executions. Instead, we shall continue our democratic struggle. 
We do not intend to flee, but we expect the Europeans to 
realize that violations of human rights in Turkey have reached 
such proportions that there is no more democracy in this 
country, the elections are illegitimate, and the DEP is waging a 
just struggle. We do not want any asylum or personal protection. 
  [Maxton] That means you want support so that you can 
continue to be politically active on a legal level in this 
country. 
  [Gunel] That is right. We do not know what may develop. 
Some 50-60 people are dying in this country every day. This 
massacre of Turks and Kurds, soldiers, guerillas, and villagers 
must be stopped. We are prepared to pay a high price for this, 
if necessary. The arrest of our parliamentary deputies is also 
a price we have paid. But the killing must stop.

<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Federal Government Seeks EU </F>
Harmonization of Interest Taxation in 1994"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Government wants to 
harmonize the taxation of interest rates within the European 
Union [EU] by the second half of 1994 at the latest, Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel, Christian Social Union [CSU], told 
correspondents in Bonn. 
  The harmonizing of the taxation of interest rates is one of 
the goals that the Federal Government wants to implement in the 
second half of 1994 as a high priority. The finance minister 
rejected Bonn opposition demands for compensation for the tax on 
interest rates. Every regulation based on samples or supervision 
would lead to more of a substantial transfer of capital abroad 
than the current taxation at source. In addition, it is obvious 
that a form of European harmonization based on a relaxation of 
banking secrecy cannot be achieved. 
  Waigel warned Oskar Lafontaine, minister-president of 
Saarland, against condemning the Maastricht Treaty. Lafontaine 
said that in view of economic developments, the Maastricht 
Treaty cannot be adhered to. According to Waigel, statements to 
that effect could deprive European governments of the courage 
needed to achieve the observance of the criteria that have been 
agreed upon for participation in economic and monetary union. 
However, stressed the minister, it is obvious that adherence to 
stability criteria is more important than observing deadlines.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alliance 90/Greens spokesman Ludger Volmer </F>
by Golo Schmidt, place and date not given: "Hope Despite 
Refusal"] 
  [Text] The party congress resolutions of the Alliance 
90/Greens were firmly rejected not only by the Union parties 
[CDU/CSU--Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and 
the Free Democrats [FDP--Free Democratic Party]. Criticism was 
also voiced immediately after the conclusion of the national 
assembly in Mannheim by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany]. Our correspondent Golo Schmidt spoke with the party 
executive spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens, Ludger 
Volmer. 
  [Schmidt] Herr Volmer, does the flat refusal by the Social 
Democrats to enter into a coalition with the Alliance 90/Greens 
come as a surprise? 
  [Volmer] Actually, the only refusal that was "flat" was that 
by Herr Rappe, who is also the chairman of the IG Chemie labor 
union. But that does not surprise me. Rappe has been on this 
tack for ten years. We are, after all, very critical of the 
chemical industry, and this naturally also impacts on the 
associated labor union. 
  [Schmidt] But SPD party whip Verheugen also declined 
vigorously. 
  [Volmer] He had to. As long as party boss Scharping wants to 
avoid all coalition statements and his course is still headed 
more in the direction of the Union and the FDP, his party whip 
cannot just get up and say that the Greens are the natural 
coalition partner. 
  [Schmidt] The rejection is linked particularly to the demand 
of the Alliance 90/Greens for the abolishment of the Bundeswehr 
and NATO. Would this basic position of your party even be 
negotiable? 
  [Volmer] What matters to us is the direction in which we go. 
NATO continues to represent a strategy of escalation, while we 
want deescalation. We know that the dissolution cannot be 
carried out within a coalition period of four years. But there 
has to be a party which preserves the vision of an armament-free 
foreign policy. And the switches have to be set toward a 
demilitarization and a "civilizing" of the foreign policy. 
  [Schmidt] If the thesis of the Alliance 90/Greens is 
correct, 
i.e., that the SPD has made a shift to the right: Must radical 
demands not virtually force the SPD into a grand coalition? 
  [Volmer] In the SPD, as well, there are reform forces which 
would gladly work together with us. One can speculate on how 
strong these are in their party. With our demands, we want in 
any case to apply pressure on the SPD to keep its own promises 
for reform. 
  [Schmidt] Do you still believe in a red-green coalition 
following the next Bundestag election? 
  [Volmer] In a purely arithmetic sense, the farther the SPD 
goes to the right, the greater the chances for such a majority 
become. Since this is currently the case, we are, however, also 
faced with the dilemma that the differences in content become 
greater. That makes the formation of a coalition more difficult.

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Dietrich: "With a Pronounced Will to </F>
Power"] 
  [Text] Gerhard Schroeder was not exactly spoiled by success 
in the last year before his election success. First he was 
defeated by Rudolf Scharping in the membership poll on the 
national chairmanship of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany]. Then the party leadership abandoned him when he worked 
out the energy consensus with Federal Environmental Minister 
Toepfer. Toepfer's four-year-old red-green coalition, which he 
himself praised as a "model for Bonn," has lost a lot of value 
since the theme of jobs pushed aside all other wishes and 
visions. 
  But anyone who thought that Schroeder would now enter the 
landtag elections as a beaten man was deceiving himself. 
Schroeder was there once again and that is not all--everywhere 
he was the first on the scene when it was a matter of jobs. He 
helped initiate the highly regarded new worktime model at the 
Volkswagen Works and stood by the labor force of the Dasa Works 
in Lemwerder that was supposed to be closed. However one 
assesses his individual intrigues, the head of the government 
was well received in his own federal land. The Schroeder posters 
that got by without the name Schroeder and even without the 
abbreviation SPD were evidence of his unbroken self-confidence. 
"Listen, decide, and act," was the only commentary on the face 
pensively supported in his hand. Thus the people were given the 
message that the former Juso [Young Socialist] has finally 
turned into a trustworthy land father. 
  Schroeder learned to deal with the adversities of life 
early. 
The charming bon vivant, whom many see in him and whom he 
himself sometimes extols when he presents himself ironically as 
the "chairman of the Toscana caucus," is just one side of his 
being. The other side is that of the climber, who has developed 
a respectable existence as an attorney by way of the second 
educational path after very humble beginnings and thereby made 
his way in politics. That took toughness, ambition, and 
intelligence. 
  The skilled Lower Saxon--Schroeder grew up in Lippe, 
Westphalia--never waited for anyone to call him. He was there 
wherever opportunities opened up for him and he developed a fine 
feel for what was expected of him in each case. He became 
chairman of the Jusos in 1978, Bundestag deputy in 1980, top 
candidate of the SPD in Lower Saxony in 1984, and 
minister-president in 1990. The stations of his path were by no 
means on a straight line. He left a lot of his comrades behind 
on the curves. 
  His extraordinary rhetorical talent always helped him out. 
Often enough that got him through. Schroeder's persuasive power 
is based on double feedback: he almost always finds the right 
tone and then, purely out of enthusiasm for the effect of his 
own words, he says what the people want to hear. Hence the role 
that he plays of the pragmatic or "doer" suits him much better 
than his former role, that of the ideologically set SPD leftist. 
Bushy eyebrows and the massive chin indicate the pronounced will 
to power of a politician who is just now reaching his 50th 
birthday. The fact that Schroeder's ambition will not always be 
satisfied in Hannover is well-known in the SPD. Even Engholm 
felt the hot breath of the Lower Saxon on his neck. So it will 
be with Scharping if he does become federal chancellor very soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Christine Richter: "The Governing Mayor With the </F>
Best Image; Infas-Poll: Berliners Rate Senate Members; CDU Would 
Lose 8 Percent in Elections"] 
  [Text] The Berliners rate their senators very 
differently. The greatest confidence is enjoyed by Mayor 
Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union]. 
  Fifty-three percent of the Berliners rate his performance as 
"good," 39 percent as "more poor than good." This is the result 
of a representative poll that the "infas" public opinion 
institute was commissioned to take by the BERLINER ZEITUNG. 
"Notable in this case," the pollsters say, "is that the mayor 
gets predominantly good ratings not only within his own camp, 
but from supporters of the coalition partner SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] as well." In second place on the 
popularity list is Senator for Juvenile Affairs Thomas Krueger 
(SPD): 38 percent rate him positively, while one in four views 
his image as negative. Almost identical ratings are given to 
Senator for Women's Affairs Christine Bergmann and Senator for 
Social Affairs Ingrid Stahmer (both SPD): 36 percent of those 
polled rate them as "good," 27 percent as "poor." 
  Cultural Affairs Senator Ulrich Roloff-Momin (unaffiliated) 
is the recipient of more criticism than favor (27 to 37 
percent), and things look even worse for the rest of the team. 
Approximately half the population gives a predominantly poor 
rating to Construction Senator Wolfgang Nagel (SPD) and to his 
colleague, Urban Development Senator Volker Hassemer (CDU), with 
whom he is currently locked in a violent dispute over the 
construction plan for Alexanderplatz. The same is true for CDU 
Senators Elmar Pieroth (Finance), Dieter Heckelnmann (Internal 
Security), and Herwig Haase, who is responsible for bus lanes, 
the 30-kilometer speed limit, and the "right turn on red" 
system. Most Berliners either cannot, or do not want to, give 
their opinion on the other senate members. 
  If the election were held now in Berlin, the CDU would 
suffer 
significant losses (see table below). Eight percent fewer than 
four years ago would vote for the Christian Democrats. The SPD 
would be unable to profit from this. It would get 30 percent of 
the votes, so that the two governing parties would be locked in 
a neck-to-neck race. Considering the distribution of the balance 
of the votes, a continuation of the grand coalition would appear 
likely. The FDP [Free Democratic Party], which at the moment is 
waging its struggles for power in unadorned fashion, would no 
longer be represented in the House of Deputies. The Alliance 
90/Greens would receive 12 percent. The undisputed winner--and 
third-strongest caucus--would be the PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism] with 15 percent.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In Berlin, charges have been 
brought against the hard-currency procurer of the GDR 
Government, Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, in connection with 
the illegal supplying of weapons and military equipment. The 
Government Crimes working group is accusing the 61-year-old and 
two others of illegal arms deals, according to Military 
Government Ordinance Number 53, the Berlin judicial authorities 
announced in Berlin today. 
  The charge sheet is almost 300 pages long. The economic 
crimes bench of Berlin Regional Court has not yet set a date for 
the trial. According to the list of charges, Schalck-Golodkowski 
is said to have reached agreement with the accused, 47-year-old 
Edgar K, on procuring weapons made by western manufacturers for 
the GDR. K. set up a company in western Germany for this 
purpose. Via a third accused, 75-year-old Waradin D., 
Schalck-Golodkowski regularly ordered weapons from the firm from 
April 1980 until October 1989 and received a total of around 
2,000 weapons costing more than 3.3 million marks. Two hundred 
and forty-six sets of military night vision equipment for 8.2 
million marks and $333,000 were also obtained. 
  The supplies went via an Austrian arms dealer to the cover 
firm "Petrov Handelskonto" at Schoenefeld Airport [in eastern 
Berlin]. Schalck-Golodkowski then organized the distribution of 
the weapons to the Ministries of State Security and the Interior 
and to the National People's Army.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Hans Guenther Merk, president of 
the Federal Statistical Office, has drawn a broadly positive 
picture of economic development in the former east Germany. 
Speaking to the media in Berlin today, he pointed out that the 
renewal and restructuring of the capital stock had made 
considerable progress over the last three years. Thus from 1991 
to 1993, 342 billion marks [DM] were invested in the new federal 
states and the eastern part of Berlin. Of this, DM288 billion 
was allocated to the private sector and DM54 billion to the 
state. 
  Merk went on to say that in 1993 the per capita figure for 
gross fixed asset investment in the former East Germany exceeded 
the level in the former territory of the Federal Republic for 
the first time. Net investment per capita was as much as 140 
percent higher than in the former territory of the Federal 
Republic. Thus the gap in capital stock between eastern and 
western Germany had been reduced. 
  Following the deep economic slump, particularly in 1990 and 
1991, and the loss of more than a third of jobs, gross domestic 
product increased in real terms by 9.7 percent in 1992 and 7.1 
percent in 1993. This had particularly positive effects on the 
construction sector. Thus, production in the construction 
sector had begun to increase again from mid-1991. 
  The president of the Federal Statistical Ofice pointed out 
that the imbalance on the labor market is still very large. An 
annual average of 1.15 million people were unemployed in 1993. 
It was also calculated that the burden on the labor market had 
been eased by around 1.5 million people due to labor market 
measures such as training courses, retraining, and job creation 
schemes. At the end of February 1994, 1.3 million people were 
registered unemployed. 
  The gap between incomes of private households in the states 
of the former East Germany and in the former Federal Republic 
closed significantly, particularly in 1991 and 1992. Disposable 
income per capita stood at DM1,450 per month in the second half 
of 1993. This is 62 percent of the West German level. In the 
second half of 1990 incomes had been 41 percent of the West 
German level. Gross salary and wages per employee reached 
almost 71 percent of the level in the former West Germany in the 
second half of 1993, Merk announced. Compared to the second half 
of 1990, they had increased by 124 percent. 
  Consumer prices rose by 38 percent over this period in the 
states of the former East Germany, particularly because of the 
alignment of rents and several public service tariffs. The 
price hikes have since settled down. In February 1994 the price 
index for the cost of living of all employees' households had 
only increased by 3.5 percent compared to the same month in 1993.

<F P=106> ["knoe." report: "Upswing in the East"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Two renowned research institutes are 
perceiving positive signals in the development of the east 
German economy. According to the Cologne Institute of German 
Economics (IW) industrial production in eastern Germany "is 
growing." The Hamburg Archive for World Economy [HWWA] talks of 
a "continuous recovery process." 
  According to the HWWA, the GDP of the new laender will 
probably grow by 7 percent in 1994 (7.1 percent last year). 
However, progress will continue to depend on "major financial 
transfers from the west." 
  According to the analysis of the Hamburg researchers, the 
construction trade, which increased its production by well over 
10 percent in 1993, continues to be the most important economic 
force. First, the demand from public and industrial sectors 
dominated in 1993, then it was the housing construction sector 
(increase by 70 percent). "However, the upswing, which was at 
first almost exclusively concentrated on the construction sector 
and private services, has broadened with the stimulation of 
industry." Last year, the processing trade produced about 10 
percent more. 
  In the opinion of the IW, the plastics-processing industry 
is 
the winner of the structural change in the past three years: 
Output more than doubled. Production increased by more than 50 
percent in steel and light-metal construction, the cement 
industry, building materials, and cold rolling mills. The 
production share of the 10 best branches of industry increased 
from 30 to 55 percent, it was stated. 
  The leather industry suffered the sharpest decline: 
According to IW calculations, the volume of goods decreased by 
84 percent from 1990 to 1993. Another 11 branches had to cope 
with production losses of more than 50 percent: Among them there 
is also the machine-building industry (- 65.2 percent) and the 
electrical industry (50.0 percent). IW economist Karl Lichtblau 
says that the reason is "the economic decline in the west and 
the stronger orientation to the world market, in contrast to the 
construction sector, for example." 
  According to the HWWA, investments by enterprises in eastern 
Germany increased by 13 percent in 1993, but they lost dynamism, 
as compared to 1992 (20 percent). The unit labor costs of 
collectively agreed wages, which amount to about 80 percent of 
the western standard, are too high because of productivity, 
which is 50 percent lower, it was stated.

<F P=106> [Article by "df": "Wage Pact Negotiators Have Done Their </F>
Job; Now the Bundesbank Has To Act"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 Mar--The head of the German 
Federation of Trade Unions, Michael Geuenich, characterized for 
HANDELSBLATT the outcome of the metal and chemical industries 
collective bargaining negotiations for 1994 "as a thunderclap 
that should rouse those who make economic policy in Bonn and 
fiscal policy at the Bundesbank from their inaction." The stance 
of the Bundesbank, in particular, can no longer be justified on 
economic grounds. 
  Signs are increasing in the Federal Republic that the 
recession has not yet hit bottom. Industrial production in the 
fourth quarter of 1993 was again 4 percent below last year's low 
figure, and incoming orders also failed to reach the level of 
last year's quarter. Because of the strong effect of losses, 
caused in part by the government's economy measures and tax 
increases, a further setback in the first quarter of 1994 cannot 
be ruled out. This view is reenforced by even lower than 
generally expected collective wage agreements, which will cause 
revenues to decline more than anticipated. 
  Almost 12 months ago, industrial producer prices stopped 
rising. In December 1993 they were 0.1 percent below the level 
of 1992. Wholesale prices indicated complete stability. Even the 
rate of retail price increases had only a 1 before the period. 
Today, the rate of price increases in all of West Europe is the 
lowest since the beginning of the nineties. 
  Geuenich: "Interest rates, nevertheless, continue to drop 
much more slowly than they did in the United States when it was 
in a similar economic situation, and much slower than in all 
previous German downturns. The interest rate policy of the 
European Union is chained to that of the German Bundesbank." 
  An imminent revival of investment activities is therefore 
not 
expected in Europe, especially since consumer confidence in 
almost all countries is just as low as it is in Germany. 
Therefore, since Europe is the center of the German export 
trade, there is no hope for a lasting revival of the Federal 
Republic's exports. 
  Geuenich: "The government and the Bundesbank never tire of 
giving pedantic advice during ongoing wage negotiations. Whether 
they like it or not, they are now caught in a cul-de-sac of 
paralyzing inactivity. They can get out only by initiating 
reassuring, expansive measures." 
<H5>  Interest Rates Must Drop Quickly to Much Lower Levels </H5>
  This clearly means that the Bundesbank must quickly allow 
interest rates to drop considerably. The current discount rate, 
which has a 5 in front of its period, used to be associated with 
times of boom, but never with such a full-fledged recession as 
we experience today. After all, because of the Bundesbank's 
policy, the volume of consumer credits, current accounts, and 
discount credits of roughly 500 billion German marks [DM] is 
more expensive. The Bundesbank must act to remove this barrier 
to demand. How can fear of inflation still be rampant in 
Frankfurt when in almost all European countries, including 
Germany, prices of goods not affected by the government do not 
rise, but decline, and when capacity remains greatly 
underutilized? 
  Nor can the Federal Government, according to Geuenich, 
forever defend itself with the argument that it lacks fiscal 
flexibility. Raising investment grants by, let us say, 10 
percent for equipment and commercial construction investments, 
provided the volume exceeds that of 1993, for example, would 
reduce tax revenues by an estimated DM2.5 to 3 billion. The 
Institute for Economic Research has determined that for 1992, 
investment grants created 350,000 permanent jobs. Considering 
the overall cost of DM42,000 for each unemployed worker, the 
cited effect on the job market saved the public DM15 billion. 
  The Location Security Legislation passed a few months ago 
cannot be accepted until doomsday as an alibi to demonstrate 
that economic policy has been done justice. The Federal 
Government and the Bundesbank talk incessantly about "investor 
confidence." However, with their paralyzing inaction they, 
themselves, are responsible for a climate of insecurity and 
disincentives. Geuenich: "The trade unions are doing their duty 
in an exemplary manner; now the pedants in Bonn and Frankfurt 
have to make a move." 
  In contrast to the Federal Republic, the United States has 
found a way to initiate its monetary and fiscal policy 
successfully. A change in monetary policy toward expansion 
occurred in the United States as early as the beginning of 1990, 
just one year after the start of the recession. American 
corporate investments for equipment showed a particularly strong 
increase, and in 1992 and 1993 real growth exceeded 10 percent. 
Financial policy, too, did not switch to consolidation until 
early in 1993; in 1992 it still contributed heavily to the 
stabilization of the recovery.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Werner Adam: "Russia as Partner"] </F>
  [Text] The new world order just does not seem to be 
working. The hopes fed three years ago by the unprecedented 
cooperation to expel the Iraqi aggressors from Kuwait has turned 
out to be false. At that time the motto that aggression must 
never again pay seemed for the first time to have been 
convincingly confirmed under the roof of the United Nations and 
under American leadership. Yet, a little later it was harshly 
refuted in the Balkans. Although the Soviet Union had meanwhile 
disintegrated and the so-called balance of power undergone 
drastic changes, Western reaction to the Serbian aggression was 
a very sorry affair. 
  Europe's failure in Europe itself has considerably 
contributed to the revival of an old order, as conceived under 
Nixon and Kissinger and consolidated under Reagan and Bush: 
American-Soviet efforts to solve regional conflicts guided by a 
global accommodation of interests. It was particularly in 
Gorbachev that Washington thought it had found its ideal 
partner. The man who then ruled in the Kremlin, and who -- 
unexpectedly for everybody -- was to go down in history as the 
last president of the Soviet Union, agreed on comprehensive 
disarmament programs with the leading Western power; gave in to 
American pressure to withdraw the Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan; and, after the invasion of the Soviet Union's ally, 
Iraq, in Kuwait, more or less supported the West's policy; and 
subsequently, together with Bush, restarted the Middle East 
peace process in Madrid. 
  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, without 
having to make the least effort, was recognized by the West as 
the natural successor to the Soviet Union with a permanent seat 
in the UN Security Council and the sole claim to the nuclear 
heritage. This was bound to hurt other former Soviet republics, 
notably Ukraine. Yet, for the West it was obvious to continue to 
concentrate on Moscow in its dealings with the East, which 
suddenly got hit by irritating revolutionary changes. 
  Comparable with Gorbachev before, Yeltsin, by a marked 
pro-Western foreign policy, encouraged the United States and its 
European allies in this decision. In Clinton, he found an 
American President who was even more understanding toward him 
and his country than predecessor Bush. This was vividly 
reflected earlier this year, when Clinton and Yeltsin almost 
enthusiastically said about the relations between their 
countries that now finally a "mature strategic partnership" had 
been created that is based on "equality, mutual advantage, and 
the recognition of national interests of the other side." 
  Yet, at that time a change in Russian foreign policy began 
to 
emerge that could hardly have been overlooked. Partly 
encouraged, partly urged by the election success of right-wing 
extremist Zhirinovskiy and the by no means less 
nationalistically acting old Bolsheviks, Yeltsin and Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev began to use language that increasingly brought 
back memories of practices under the Soviet superpower. Moscow 
claimed to have a right of veto against its former satellites in 
East and Central Europe, which are now seeking NATO membership, 
and -- accompanied by overt threats toward the remaining Soviet 
successor republics -- proclaimed itself the protector of all 
Russians in the "near neighborhood" and, finally, indicated -- 
typically during a Kozyrev visit to Beijing -- that in the 
future Russia would no longer put up with the West telling it 
what to do. Since then, this Russia has been trying almost on a 
daily basis to act again as a superpower, and, as such, it has 
returned to the stage both in the Balkans and the Middle East. 
  There is, actually, not much one could say against it, as 
long as Moscow reactivates its former influence in the various 
areas of the world for their pacification, and not for 
undermining similar efforts by the West. Utmost caution is, 
however, advised when it comes to integrating Russia into the 
Partnership for Peace as offered by NATO, even though it can be 
in nobody's interest to encourage Russia in its age-old 
obsession of being isolated. Still, one should distinguish 
between the usefulness and advantage of close political and 
economic cooperation with Russia and the claim raised by Moscow 
to a special role within the partnership with the West. The 
latter would not only be tantamount to a confirmation of fears 
for security in East and Central Europe, it might even weaken 
the Western alliance as such. 
  Such reservations have nothing to do with digging up old 
enemy images. If no new world order is to be had, the revival 
of the old should by no means tempt anybody to encourage Russia 
in its obvious drive to acquire a dominant position regarding 
the "near abroad," or to apply Western pressure on those former 
Soviet republics that are opposed to such ambitions. One 
condition for a strategic partnership is that Russia 
acknowledges the decline of its former empire once and for all. 
Otherwise it will not be possible to have what U.S. policy on 
Russia envisages as a "benign bipolarity": mutual friendly 
cooperation between the Kremlin and the White House that is 
beneficial for all.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Claus Gennrich: "No Desire for a Fight With </F>
Kinkel? Moellemann Says He Is Still Thinking About It; A Run for 
the FDP Presidium Is Risky"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 11 Mar--The former Federal Minister for 
Economics Moellemann is preparing his ascent in the FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] leadership. At the present time, the North 
Rhine-Westphalia Land chairman is conducting talks with other 
land associations of the FDP and with members of the FDP 
Presidium to clarify his prospects of being elected into the 
leading circle at the national party congress in Rostock at the 
beginning of June. The Presidium position of Carola von Braun, 
who had to resign from the land chairmanship in Berlin after the 
"Figaro-Affair," must be filled. Moellemann is aiming in this 
direction and has let this be known. He previously belonged to 
the Presidium not as an elected member, but on the basis of his 
ministerial offices. His election to the broader national board 
was always more or less close. A year after his resignation as 
minister for economics, he now obviously sees the chance to 
benefit from a kind of reparation bonus. A timely place in the 
Presidium before the Bundestag electon could improve his 
prospects for something beyond that. Between 1991 and the 
beginning of 1993, Moellemann was considered to be a candidate 
for the chairmanship of the FDP. Most recently he has 
increasingly advocated an independent course for the FDP and 
differentiation from the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union]. Moellemann favors the election of 
the SPD's [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate Rau as 
federal president in May. 
  Moellemann told this newspaper on Friday [11 March] that he 
has not yet decided, because until now he has "not spoken 
definitively with everyone." A conversation with parliamentary 
group chairman Solms has not yet taken place, because he has 
been too busy with the nursing care insurance. "I have informed 
party chairman Kinkel that I am considering it but have not yet 
decided." Moellemann said that he asked Rhineland-Palatinate 
Land Chairman Bruederle, who is economic minister in the Mainz 
coalition government under Scharping, about his intentions. 
Moellemann let it be known that he suggested to Bruederle that 
he be a candidate for the Presidium. But he answered that 
Moellemann should run. Bruederle referred to the fact that he 
had spoken with many FDP politicians and thereby mentioned that 
it is generally considered better for Moellemann to be in the 
Presidium than outside. Moellemann expressed his criticism of 
the composition of the leadership circle with the remark: "The 
Presidium can be strengthened." Moellemann first wants to wait 
and see whether and which other candidates will declare 
themselves. There is yet time until July. Before that he wants 
to concentrate on the fight in his land association. A land 
party congress in April will reelect the FDP leadership in North 
Rhine-Westphalia; the land list for the Bundestag election must 
be presented by the end of May. Sixteen of the 17 Bundestag 
deputies from North Rhine-Westphalia and two other candidates 
are competing for the at best 12 somewhat secure places on the 
list. 
<H5>  Unity Through Tactics </H5>
  Moellemann is still annoyed with Kinkel about the events in 
the selection of the new Education Minister Laermann. Weeks ago 
Moellemann had indicated that he was "flabbergasted" over the 
fact that Kinkel and Solms had reduced the FDP from 12 to 5 to 7 
percent after the election of the chairman last June and were 
nevertheless damaging "the largest battalions"--the Duesseldorf 
land association. He is upset with Kinkel for maintaining the 
"inaccurate" portrayal that after the resignation of Education 
Minister Ortleb the chairman had asked him whether he wanted to 
return only as a "gesture of courtesy." Nevertheless Moellemann 
signaled a truce on Friday: "I have no desire to keep on 
fighting with Kinkel." Because of the upcoming elections, the 
matter is becoming "too serious for the FDP." They must combine 
their forces, for there is no other way. Accordingly, he will 
probably keep his opinions about Kinkel to himself after the 
election Sunday [13 March] in Lower Saxony. 
  Despite the disturbed relationship between Kinkel and the 
restless Moellemann, the party chairman appears to be convinced 
that in the election year neither of the two will allow himself 
to be played against the other. Solidarity is also a wise tactic 
for Moellemann at this time, because otherwise reverses for the 
FDP could be attributed to the obstructionist. Kinkel is 
obviously inclined to the view that it is more beneficial to tie 
the chairman of the large land association to decisions of the 
FDP Presidium. Possibly Kinkel sees this as the lesser evil in 
comparison with a constant source of trouble. Other members of 
the leadership, on the other hand, are alarmed or at least 
uncomfortable with the fact that Moellemann is about to build a 
pedestal for appearances as an "antipope." In the end, no one 
will dare to oppose Moellemann's candidacy if Kinkel is for it. 
  Still, they are saying that "Moellemann must guard against 
hearing a call from the party that is not coming at all." But 
many are aware of Moellemann's organizational abilities, so that 
the warning sounds defensive. In the Bundestag group, Moellemann 
has gotten on the nerves of several deputies with his constant 
attacks against the "incompetent" Finance Minister Waigel (CSU). 
"Once again, we hear the entire national economic expertise," 
the people said derisively when Moellemann got going. Moellemann 
has realized more and more that he cannot change much with 
criticism from the outside; it would be easier in the party 
Presidium. But the game is full of dangers. It is said in the 
FDP: "A failure at the party congress would set Moellemann's 
ambitions back several lengths." On the other hand, they are 
making this prediction: "If there is no opposing candidacy to 
Moellemann in Rostock, that means a farther-reaching signal to 
the executive level." Experienced members of the leadership are 
saying: "If Kinkel says that he wants Moellemann's candidacy and 
others say that they cannot oppose him, then it will be 
difficult to predict the voting behavior of the delegates to the 
party congress in a mixture of feeling and intellect; it is one 
thing if the leadership recommends something but another thing 
whether the delegates will act accordingly." 
  Until now the vacancy in the Presidium has been attributed 
to 
women and possible east Germans. The east Berliner Frau Paetzold 
occupied the spot and then lost it to Carola von Braun from all 
of Berlin. Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger now has 
bad cards; if she were to compete for the position, people would 
probably say that she is already in the Presidium because of her 
office. Wagner, the chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in 
Hesse, was defeated by Frau von Braun in 1991. Frau Wagner would 
likely have little chance now, because there are already two 
people from Hesse in the leadership body: the deputy chairman 
Gerhardt and treasury's Solms. It is considered conceivable that 
the deputy chairman of the Bundestag group, Weng, is thinking 
about whether he should run against Moellemann. For Weng, 
however, it may well be more important to plan to succeed 
Cronenberg, the vice president of the Bundestag, after the 
Bundestag election. 
  If Kinkel were to want someone other than Moellemann in the 
Presidium--there is already a search among east German women--he 
would have to use his influence as chairman early. But that is 
considered unlikely; many consider Kinkel to be too unsteady and 
too weak for this. Little doubt is being expressed about 
Moellemann's talents; but it is said that too frequently he 
employs them for himself only. This is the impression that 
Moellemann has to fight against; but he can also count on the 
FDP needing him. Bearing in mind the poor results so far in the 
elections for the executive board and his reputation, his game 
is risky for Rostock but the view to what comes later makes the 
effort worthwhile for him.

<F P=106> [Report by Serdar Dimli from Bucharest] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who is currently 
visiting Bucharest with President Suleyman Demirel, spoke to 
Turkish reporters this morning on the recent UN Security Council 
resolution. Cetin said that since the onset of the incidents in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkey announced that it is willing to 
contribute troops to the UN force. The necessary infrastructure 
needed for this has been under preparation for a long time, 
Cetin remarked, adding that intensive efforts are under way with 
the UN secretary general and the permanent members of the 
Security Council to this end. Finally, Cetin noted, the United 
Nations asked Turkey to participate in the peace force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to Cetin, the UN request at this stage consists of 
a 2,700-person mechanized unit. The composition of this force 
will be 1,200 infantry, 500 support personnel, and 1,000 
logistics personnel. Cetin declared that a delegation comprised 
of members of the Foreign Ministry and the General Staff will 
meet with UN officials and draft a protocol. The protocol will 
outline where and when the unit will go as well as other 
details. Cetin said: Our troops can assume duty in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina one week after the signing of the protocol. 
  The foreign minister explained that when the government was 
sending troops to Somalia, it obtained the necessary 
authorization from the Turkish Grand National Assembly with 
regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well, and the necessary 
preparations were undertaken on this matter. Cetin added: Our 
force will go to Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible in a bid 
to contribute to peace and stability. Our aim is to put an end 
to the pain and drama in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been 
experiencing the biggest tragedy of the century for the past two 
years. This is what we seek and what we aim to do. We 
contributed to this at every level and at every phase. We 
submitted proposals. Late as it may be, our proposals are now 
being considered. This delay cost the lives of tens of 
thousands of people and many tears. As we approach peace, I 
believe that our peace force will greatly contribute to peace. 
  Answering questions, Cetin said that there are certain 
recommendations with regard to the location of the Turkish unit. 
Pointing out that both the Muslims and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina requested Turkish troops, Cetin noted: 
Therefore, we naturally want to serve in their areas. Cetin 
concluded by saying that Turkish troops gained great experience 
in Somalia for this task and inspired confidence in the world on 
this subject.

  [Text] The Supreme Military Council, which met in Ankara 
the day before yesterday, said it had insufficient mandates and 
asked for more. The Council decided to issue new instructions 
to the government and press. 
  An agreement was reached at the meeting "to meet the 
hardware 
and economic needs of the Turkish Armed Forces [TAF], prevent 
the destructive campaign against the Armed Forces, and ensure 
the publication of positive reports in the press." 
  Ciller "blamed the SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] in 
connection with the subjects discussed, and promised to do 
everything she could." 
  According to information obtained from sources close to TAF, 
during its extraordinary session in Ankara the day before 
yesterday, the Supreme Military Council discussed numerous 
problems, primarily the war and Kurds. The meeting demanded an 
end to the destructive propaganda against the TAF and an 
assurance on "the broadcasting and publication of appropriate 
programs and items on TAF in the media." 
  Complete consensus was said to be reached on the following: 
  "The urgent procurement of hardware needed by TAF, the 
introduction of the necessary amendments to the military 
personnel laws as specified by relevant military commanders and 
in line with requirements and demands, the determination of 
premium payments during states of emergency and similar 
situations in accordance with the importance of the situation, 
the adoption of necessary measures by the government to prevent 
destructive speculation and campaigns against TAF and Army 
commanders, and the need not to inform the public about tasks 
given to TAF, leaving TAF officials to make statements if 
needed." 
<H5>  "Continue Pressure on DEP" </H5>
  The meeting also called for sending reinforcements to the 
region [southeast] to increase the deterrent power of the 
troops. In a clear reference to the DEP [Democracy Party], the 
meeting demanded that "activities by separatist parties should 
not be allowed and sanctions against them should continue inside 
and outside the Turkish Grand National Assembly." 
<H5>  New Demands From Syria and Iraq </H5>
  The Supreme Military Council, which called "for presenting 
new demands to Syria and Iraq and formulating a new policy 
toward them," also discussed issues relating to Greece and 
Armenia. The meeting decided "to conduct a deterrent campaign 
on international forums and prepare to impose every type of 
sanction on these states and to increase every assistance to 
Azerbaijan to deter Armenia." 
<H5>  Ciller "Promised" </H5>
  It was learned that Prime Minister Ciller, who participated 
in the meeting even though she was not initially listed as a 
participant, "promised to do all she could" to fulfill the 
demands. Ciller left the meeting after hearing the main outline 
of the subjects to be discussed. It was learned that before 
leaving the meeting, Ciller again accused her partner, the SHP, 
and said: "We will give the necessary support to your demands." 
<H5>  "The Meeting Was Postponed Due to the DEP" </H5>
  It was learned that the Supreme Military Council, which was 
scheduled to meet in February, met instead on 18 March "because 
of developments relating to the DEP." It is being said that in 
view of public debate over the recent frequent joint meetings 
between the General Staff and National Security Council, this 
meeting was held to coincide with the celebrations of the 
Canakkale victory so as to deflect public attention.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the </F>
Workers Party of Kurdistan, at unidentified location, by an 
unidentified correspondent in Cologne; date not specified] 
  [Text] [OZGUR GUNDEM] Your party issued a statement on this 
year's Nevroz celebrations. You said: "Nevroz will be 
celebrated in homes." What concrete measures will be taken in 
this direction. 
  [Ocalan] People probably will be called on to stay at home 
during the day. They should light fires and gather at night. 
They could also fire guns if that poses no danger. The 
guerrillas too might carry out particular operations. This too 
is a form of celebration. Besides, it is not our position that 
"there must necessarily be a major explosion" on Nevruz. For 
us, every day is Nevruz. For us, Nevruz is disciplined, tactical 
work. We are not trying to turn particular days into days of 
special demonstrations. There are drawbacks in that. People 
must show understanding of our position, which aims at 
preventing massacres. There were a few massacres when an effort 
was made to mark 1 May [Workers Day] as a tradition in Turkey. 
Our decision is a precaution. That is how it should be seen. 
But the activities of the guerrillas will continue. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Tansu Ciller made a statement in connection 
with Nevruz. She said: "We were late this year but next year 
Nevruz will be declared a national holiday." The SHP [Social 
Democrat Populist Party] and MHP [Nationalist Movement Party] 
supported this proposal. What is the motive behind this 
proposal? 
  [Ocalan] [Motherland Party leader] Mesut Yilmaz said: "It is 
an election bribe." Apparently, this assessment is near the 
truth. I do not think it came from a serious thought or as a 
sign of a new process. The elections are nearing and she needs 
votes. It might have been made with this in mind. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] There will be local elections a week after 
Nevruz. The DEP [Democracy Party] announced that it will have no 
part in these elections. How would you assess those who are 
trying to get the votes that would have gone to the DEP? 
  [Ocalan] There are interesting developments in this regard. 
The DEP has vote-winning potential, on the basis of which a game 
is being played. In particular, [SHP leader and Deputy Prime 
Minister] Murat Karayalcin is engaged in a ploy. After the DEP 
was eliminated from the elections, he is trying to use its 
vote-winning potential. His statement that "we were thinking of 
legalizing Nevruz but it did not happen; next year it will be 
legalized" was partly made to win DEP votes. There are already 
reports that the immunity of DEP members was lifted to prevent 
them from participating in the elections. It was linked with 
speculation on votes. The SHP is acting with duplicity on this 
issue. It supported a parliamentary commission decision on 
lifting immunity. And, like Fehmi Isiklar and Feridun Yazar, he 
is using some Kurds as mediators to win over the Kurdish voters. 
They are creating particular lobbies to secure these votes for 
the SHP. While they ask for capital punishment for those who 
want to remain a bit honest and patriotic, they also ask for 
votes for the SHP, which passed the execution order. This is 
duplicity and a dangerous game. We will surely use our right to 
reply. If they are honest, they should make their position 
against this warning clear. But it is not admissible that they 
should first intimidate, jail, and provoke people and then 
appear in the role of a guardian angel and become part of the 
game. This is a dangerous path. We warn its authors. We will 
not lower ourselves to the extent of becoming tools in this 
game. Such an election game does exist. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Could we learn from you personally about the 
PKK position on these elections? 
  [Ocalan] Ours is an active boycott of the elections. 
Anyway, in our view there is a war, not elections. They will 
never allow an election to be held. They have already taken 
measures. They have gathered the ballot boxes in villages under 
the control of village guards. The special warfare units will 
allow no democratic voting. They will do everything to rig the 
results in their favor. There is no sense in becoming a tool in 
such an election. We cannot concede to such a game. We will 
spoil this election deception that they have organized. I think 
the DEP too understood this reality, that is, contrary to some 
claims, the DEP did not withdraw from elections on "Apo's 
[Abdullah Ocalan] instructions." Rather, DEP people knew very 
well that they [the Turkish authorities] would not have allowed 
them to get elected. They took all the necessary measures. 
  We are witnessing an open massacre of democratic people, the 
denial of every election right. We know the candidates that 
will now take the DEP's place. Take Cizre: Some 95 percent of 
the town's population is made up of patriots and democrats. But 
the RP [Welfare Party] is trying to get Karno, the head of 300 
village guards, elected as mayor. Karno has always been a 
village guard chieftain and has served in the most dangerous 
special warfare teams. He is not the head of a town, but of a 
counterguerrilla team. He is a target. He became an RP member. 
That too was a tactic. They want to strengthen the RP in 
Kurdistan. This is being done in accordance with a decision 
made by the General Staff. We will eliminate any candidate, be 
he from the SHP or any other party, and particularly if he is a 
candidate from the RP, who wants to get the DEP's votes. Since 
they have set out to expel us from the elections and massacre 
us--massacres have indeed happened--we will use our right to 
resist. I am warning such people. Don't let them say later: 
"We did not hear" or "We have been given unduly severe 
punishment." It is clear which side was first to inflict severe 
punishment. 
  We supported some of the people in the Turkish Parliament 
who 
might have been the real voice of the people. They were not PKK 
members. Despite that, we supported them for their attachment 
to the people and for hoping that they would speak out about 
particular demands from the rostrum. We expected nothing more 
from them. Considering that they are being suppressed and put on 
trial on charges of treason, we will use the same language 
against those who will supplant them. We are calling on such 
people not to become tools in this game. We don't want them to 
become tools, be it under the guise of the RP or SHP. We are 
strong. They must know that as our strength increases, they 
will be severely punished. This is the way we are entering the 
election period. We will employ the policy of preventing and 
boycotting the elections as much as our strength allows.

  [Text] The PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] is bleeding in east 
and southeast Anatolia. Largely deprived of logistical support, 
the PKK is also losing its leading cadres. Muslum Durgun, alias 
Dr. Baran, who was known to be [PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan's 
right-hand man, recently committed suicide when the security 
forces cornered him during an operation. 
  [Begin unidentified off-screen correspondent recording] The 
loss of logistical support is cited as the main thing causing 
the PKK to bleed. The organization has reportedly started 
sustaining losses, because it is finding difficulty in obtaining 
shelter, food, and militants. The latest example is the loss of 
Dr. Baran, who was known to be close to Ocalan. 
  Dr. Baran, the so-called official responsible for Dersim 
[the 
Tunceli and Erzincan regions] Province, used a hand grenade to 
commit suicide when he was cornered in a clash with the security 
forces. 
  The Interior Ministry announced that the militant using the 
alias Dr. Baran was found dead on 12 March 1994. 
  According to available information, the PKK, which is 
gradually losing strength, is preparing for a show of force 
during the local elections. The PKK asked for a boycott of the 
elections. If the boycott succeeds, the PKK is expected to 
become active again to regain strength. But reports from the 
region show that the PKK's call for a boycott will not succeed. 
There is reportedly enthusiasm in party headquarters in east 
and southeast Anatolia three days ahead of the elections. 
  Reports from the region indicate that the security forces 
have completed their preparations for dealing the final blow to 
the PKK soon after the local elections. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara, Mar 25 (AA) -- Two surface-to-air-missiles 
(SAM) were found in a hide-out belonging to separatist 
terrorists on Mount Agri (Ararat). 
  Security forces on an operation around the mountain in 
eastern Turkey found a hide-out. Two SAM's were found at the 
hide-out at the 13,000-foot (4,000 m) level. 
  Specialists say that the missiles were being used against 
aerial targets. 
  The same hide-out contained an RPG-type missile launcher, 27 
missiles, 43 rounds, 21 explosion moulds, a machine gun and a 
great number of Kalashnikov bullets, medicine and documents. 
  In an exclusive interview, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese 
confirmed the operation and said that security forces have been 
carrying out intensive operations since March 4 in Kars, Igdir 
and Agri. 
  `The importance of these operations are quite clear when you 
consider the damage which could have been done by the SAM's,' 
Mentese said. 
  Mentese also called on the terrorists to surrender. 
  `Let them surrender,' he said. `They have epidemics and 
instead of dying on the mountains let them surrender to the 
Turkish justice and benefit of the penitence law,' he said. 
  The SAM's have a 2-mile (3.6-km) range. The 20-pound (9-kg) 
missiles are manufactured by Russia and China.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "The Democracy Party Problem and </F>
Crisis Between Turkey and Western Countries"] 
  [Text] The move made by the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
[TGNA] to lift the parliamentary immunity of several Democracy 
Party [DP] deputies has caused a serious crisis in Turkey's 
relations with the Western countries. The visit by foreign 
delegations and the messages conveyed to Ankara by several 
leaders in the West constitute serious pressure on the coalition 
government. The messages criticized the TGNA decision and the 
subsequent detention of the DP deputies. It is appropriate to 
mention that the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs focused all 
its attention on the DP file every working day during the past 
week. According to a high-ranking official, the ministry is 
making a strenuous effort to "sell a faulty product to the 
outside world." 
  As far as Turkey is concerned, the matter has assumed a 
dangerous proportion in the international arena. In fact, the 
detention of the DP deputies has created the conditions that are 
required to internationalize the "Kurdish problem." Meanwhile, 
an impression has been created that the DP deputies have been 
"oppressed." Of course, whether that is true is another matter. 
Nevertheless, the matter has created an opportunity for 
propaganda campaigns against Turkey. 
  The problem is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not 
have any difficulty in explaining the reason for the TGNA move 
to lift the parliamentary immunity of the DP deputies. 
Meanwhile, several diplomats are convinced that the problem 
would have been easily resolved if the action against the 
deputies had been limited to the lifting of their immunity. 
  However, the main causes of the problem are: 
  1. The use of forceful action against DP deputies. 
  2. Detention of the DP deputies by the police for a 
considerable length of time. 
  Although a strong case may be made to lift their 
parliamentary immunity, it seems that developing an effective 
case to explain the forceful action against them and their 
detention will be difficult. Furthermore, considering western 
standards, no one should be expected to be satisfied with the 
arguments to support such actions. 
  Another serious aspect of the matter is that Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin have 
been worried by the mistakes made by officials and by the 
extended amount of time in which the deputies have been in 
custody. Ciller and Karayalcin agree that the detention of the 
deputies should be as short as possible and that they should be 
released before the religious festival. 
  Of course, their effort to find a formula for the release 
has 
been confronted by the independent judicial organs. 
  Unfortunately, the coalition government has given an 
opportunity to six DP deputies to place Turkey's relations with 
Western countries under their control. 
  The success the coalition government has had in placing 
itself in a difficult position will probably be an important 
addition to the list of its inefficiencies.

  [Text] Ankara--An agreement has been reached for the 
release of $517 million of the $985 million the Turkish Eximbank 
has given to the newly established Turkic republics. Meanwhile, 
most of the credits given to those republics to facilitate their 
exports have been used. General Director of Eximbank Ahmet 
Ertugrul has disclosed that Turkey agreed to give a total of 
$985 million in credit to the eight Turkic republics. Of that 
amount, $388.8 million was earmarked for export and $596.2 
million for projects. An advance approval was given for the 
release of $752.460 million. Letters of credit were opened for 
$515.150 million. In short, the Turkic republics have already 
used $517 million of the overall credit of $985 million. 
  Ahmet Ertugrul has said the Turkic republics have used $321 
million to facilitate their imports from Turkey and $196 million 
to finance their projects. 
  Contrary to the credits Turkey has given to the Turkic 
republics in Turkish lira in the past, the new credits were in 
U.S. dollars. Ertugrul has said the Turkish Eximbank had no 
difficulty in making funds available for the credits. He also 
said the bank acquired $600 million asset with the $200 million 
credit the Japanese Eximbank has extended to it and with the 
credits it received from the international bond markets some 
time ago. He noted that Eximbank has no difficulty in financing 
the projects. 
  Ertugrul also disclosed that Eximbank will use the $200 
million credit it has acquired from the Japanese Eximbank to 
cofinance the construction of an iron and steel plant in 
Kazakahstan. The factory will cost $600 million. Stressing 
that a Turkish firm has won a $50 million construction contract, 
Ertugrul asserted that Eximbank will finance 80 percent of that 
amount ($40 million). He described that as Eximbank's largest 
undertaking in cofinancing operations in its history. The 
factory will be constructed by a consortium of firms from Japan, 
Austria, and Turkey.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has stressed that 
our country insists on its firm position on the criteria 
governing the composition of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. 
Papoulias made his statement before leaving for Ioannina, where 
the European Union's General Affairs Council will meet on 26 
March. Kostas Papadhakis has the following report. 
  [Begin Papadhakis recording] Before leaving, Papoulias said 
that in addition to other topics, the Yugoslav and Bosnian 
issues will also be discussed at the meeting and that Greece 
will brief the delegates on its positions. No decisions will be 
made. The foreign minister described as an unpleasant 
development for the Turks the UN decision on the dispatch of 
Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia. He also noted that this 
decision was dictated by logistics without considering any 
historic foundations [katavoles] or psychology; instead of 
helping peace it might ultimately make things worse. 
  Referring to the Greek positions, Papoulias said that 
Greece's principle is that no blue helmets be sent to Bosnia. 
[end recording] 
  Papoulias described the UN Security Council's decision as 
wrong. 
  [Begin Papoulias recording] They made a mistake. We pointed 
this out. Often, I think, the historic foundation of problems 
is ignored and while we aim to satisfy the needs of logistics, 
we ignore a very significant element in human psychology, 
especially when it comes to the framework in which the Turkish 
troops will move in Bosnia. Instead of helping peace, I believe 
we are harming the peace process. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] This morning President Konstandinos Karamanlis 
will attend the official mass at the Athens Cathedral and watch 
the Armed Forces parade. In his message, Karamanlis notes that 
experience, both old and new, has taught us that social 
tranquility and national unity are necessary for security and 
progress in a country. He noted that we have been unable to 
implement these truths because political life is usually 
conducted in a tense climate due to intense political passions. 
[passage omitted] 
  The president said that bringing our economy nearer the 
economies of the other European Union member states should be a 
national priority. He also stressed that Cyprus' long suffering 
is continuing and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] continues to be provocative. Karamanlis added that if 
the international community does not have the courage to make 
FYROM comply, then with the careless policy that it is 
following, FYROM may cause instability in the wider region. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his message on Greek Independence Day, Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou referred to the current foreign policy 
issues. He stressed that the Cyprus issue continues to be the 
major national issue -- an issue of invasion and occupation by 
the Turkish forces, an issue of violation of the international 
law. Papandreou said: With its decisive stance on FYROM, Greek 
foreign policy made the entire international community realize 
that Greece is the one that has specific proposals on how to 
resolve the problem, contrary to the FYROM Government's 
continuing intransigence. Papandreou added that a firm and 
fundamental goal of our foreign policy is respect for the human 
rights of the Greek minority in Albania. 
  Papandreou concluded by stressing: With its stance, our 
country is continuously demonstrating its particular interest in 
peace, stability, and security in the broader region. [passage 
omitted]

not given: "`Forza Italia? Like Christian Democrats; Unless 
League Wins, It Is Finished'; Maroni and Future of Pole of 
Freedoms" first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- The official watchword is: victory for the 
pole of freedoms; we will govern with [Forza Italia leader] 
Silvio Berlusconi. Then there is the issue of what will happen 
to the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] and the Center Union, 
regarded as mere slaves, and the problem of the National 
Alliance, rejected by Umberto Bossi [Northern League Secretary] 
and Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader], but 
desired by Berlusconi, who sees Gianfranco Fini [Italian Social 
Movement (MSI) and National Alliance (AN) leader] as the 
antidote to the federalist toxins of the League. According to 
Bossi, if the pole does win, Maroni must be prime minister. 
Maroni himself commented: "This will be decided by the voters 
in the proportional quota, but note that the League believes 
that the vote in the north deserves some consideration." As far 
as Berlusconi is concerned, it is a simple matter: He will be 
prime minister. 
  So, leaving aside official stances, it is no coincidence 
that 
some people within the League are hoping for a defeat for the 
pole for freedoms, which would hit Berlusconi hard (he has 
staked everything on the premiership) and boost the League as 
the country's only opposition force, confining the Democratic 
Alliance to a subordinate role. When Bossi said, "We will 
perform the role performed by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] 
and later the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in previous 
parliaments," he was issuing a strong political indication of 
the League in opposition to a government composed of left-wing 
forces, but performing a role of stimulus and supervision. To 
do what the PCI or the PDS has done means, despite being in 
opposition, claiming the speakership of the lower house, the 
chairmanship of prestigious parliamentary committees -- in other 
words, establishing its status as the only real opposition force. 
  [Passalacqua] Mr. Maroni, what will happen if the left-wing 
forces win? 
  [Maroni] Achille Occhetto [PDS Secretary] will have an 
absolute majority, throw out [Communist Renewal leader] Fausto 
Bertinotti, bring in Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian 
Popular Party, PPI] and Bindi [PPI Venice regional secretary], 
and we will be in opposition. 
  [Passalacqua] What will Berlusconi do? 
  [Maroni] He will not have the strength to resist; he cannot 
be in opposition; he is convinced that you can change things 
only if you are in power. He does not have our background; he 
does not have the background that Bossi has, having stayed in 
the Senate alone, undaunted. 
  [Passalacqua] What will happen to the pole of freedoms? 
  [Maroni] It will be destroyed, it will disintegrate. Each 
will go his own way. But the blueprint remains. 
  [Passalacqua] What does that mean: that you will inherit 
Forza Italia? 
  [Maroni] The pole must be granted credible prospects. If 
that does happen, we will have a parliament that will last at 
least two years. Then it will be necessary to form a liberal 
democratic party under the banners of federalism and liberalism. 
A party that will stand united and compact in the next 
elections. Call it what you like, but it will be a united party. 
  [Passalacqua] Will it be called the Northern League? 
  [Maroni] If you want a clever remark, it will be called the 
liberal democratic party, section of the Northern League. 
  [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] The only path open to Berlusconi is to accede to 
government. But this is not the only path open to Bossi and, 
with him, Bertinotti and Fini: They are people who have engaged 
in opposition and who can do so again. 
  [Passalacqua] Are you saying that unless Forza Italia scores 
an overwhelming victory it will not last long? 
  [Maroni] Forza Italia is like the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party]: It can only exist if it can distribute power as it 
wants, if it can rationalize power. Not so, with us. 
  [Passalacqua] Let us consider another hypothesis -- a 
victory 
by the pole of freedoms. What will happen to the National 
Alliance? Will it be in or out? 
  [Maroni] Officially, it will be out. 
  [Passalacqua] Please clarify that. 
  [Maroni] It is a mess. Is there a possibility that the 
pole will win and gain an absolute majority without the National 
Alliance? In that case, the people will decide who will be 
prime minister. 
  [Passalacqua] What if the National Alliance were to prove 
decisive to forming a majority? 
  [Maroni] It will still be possible to govern, using the 
votes 
of the National Alliance's elected representatives that are not 
declared MSI members. A clear sign from Berlusconi on the 
subject of federalism will be enough. If the first item on the 
government's agenda is a constitutional reform to open the way 
to federalism, then we are willing to implement it even with 
Fini. 
  [Passalacqua] What if, as it is likely, nobody gains an 
absolutely majority? 
  [Maroni] The hypothesis is that there will be another 
election; a government will be formed for six months. The 
political program will be a new electoral law -- a plain 
single-candidate system and the direct election of the prime 
minister. 
  [Passalacqua] This may be the hypothesis, but what do you 
think? 
  [Maroni] I am working to ensure that the League accedes to 
government. 
  [Passalacqua] What if you were able to choose? 
  [Maroni] Again, not entirely seriously: My favorite scenario 
is that nobody will win, because it would be fun for me. But 
what I hope for is that the League, together with Forza Italia, 
will gain an absolute majority. 
  [Passalacqua] If that happens, you will be put forward for 
the premiership... 
  [Maroni] Do you want to know who will be in my team? If I 
were prime minister, which is not what I want, I would appoint 
Marco Formentini super-minister for the economy, Vito Gnutti 
industry minister, Francesco Tabladini environment minister, 
Forza Italia's Antonio Martino finance minister, and Gianfranco 
Pagliarini budget minister. What about foreign affairs? Marco 
Pannella. Defense? Franco Angioni. Justice? I would have to 
think about that, but Mino Martinazzoli is not to be discounted. 
Interior Affairs? For a year it would be delegated to the prime 
minister's office, during which time all the secret services 
would undergo a thorough cleansing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Francesco M. Bei in Rome; date not given: "Bossi: 
`Berlusconi Is the Lesser Evil'" -- first two paragraphs are 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] "You know something, the real risk in this election 
is that if the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the Left win, 
Italy will go bankrupt. With a 5 billion lire public deficit, 
we cannot afford to go back to the old system of handouts. That 
is why we are sticking with Silvio Berlusconi; he is the lesser 
evil." 
  Umberto Bossi is tired but confident about the result of the 
election: "It will be a landslide victory, the League will 
double its parliamentary seats." Regardless of whether the 
Freedom Pole wins or loses, "It will be the League that decides 
who will govern the country, as it is the force with the most 
clout." This is why he appeals to the voters to "vote League on 
the gray form, the one for the proportional quota." 
  [Bei] Did you see that the DIGOS [Division for General 
Investigations and Special Operations of the State Police] is 
visiting Forza Italia? 
  [Bossi] Yes, giving it a lot of publicity in the process. It 
looks like a ploy to pass Berlusconi off as a victim of 
persecution. 
  [Bei] And Luciano Violante resigning ... 
  [Bossi] That was consistent for him. He backed a lie, and he 
has acknowledged that he went too far. 
  [Bei] Gianfranco Miglio says: "Berlusconi is our opponent 
and Fini is our enemy." Is that how it will be after the 
election as well? 
  [Bossi] It will all depend on the figures. If we have a 
governing quorum, we shall stick with Berlusconi, but not with 
Gianfranco Fini. The time is not yet ripe for us to be able to 
use Fini's votes. It is impracticable at the national level: 
It would be as if the neo-Nazis got into government in Germany. 
  [Bei] Has the alliance with Berlusconi been a mistake, as 
Miglio says, or a skillful political operation, as Roberto 
Maroni claims? 
  [Bossi] Miglio is wrong because he is suffering from 
preelection nerves. If the League had not done the deal with 
Berlusconi, we should have found ourselves without television 
time. Berlusconi would have lined up with the DC and Mario 
Segni, and we should have had the Left on the other side: We 
would have been cut off and in a bad way. 
  [Bei] Some League supporters would have preferred to go to 
the front on their own ... 
  [Bossi] That is true, but I cannot send my troops off to 
take 
the hill under machinegun fire. It would have been a massacre. 
This time we had to resort to realpolitik. 
  [Bei] Do you believe you will be able to "straitjacket" 
Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] We already have got him in a straitjacket with the 
election deal! Forza Italia will gain few votes in the north, 
and it will only gain those few because Berlusconi is the 
chairman of Milan [soccer club]. 
  [Bei] Was it necessary to straitjacket him? 
  [Bossi] Of course it was, otherwise people might have voted 
for those who brainwash them every day, those who get into their 
homes with advertising spots on television. 
  [Bei] Might it not be that, by way of criticizing him, you 
will side with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] after the 
election, albeit under the cover of a "caretaker government"? 
  [Bossi] We cannot take up with Achille Occhetto for two 
reasons. The first is a matter of principle: The Left 
continues to oppose reliance on the free market, and the League 
is the sole true liberalist force. 
  [Bei] And the second reason? 
  [Bossi] Well, if people see us side with the Left, we shall 
be caught with our pants down, and within a fortnight the doors 
of the north will inevitably be open to the fascists, the ethnic 
party of the south, created to steal the keys to the vaults of 
the north. 
  [Bei] Maroni has said that if Berlusconi loses to Spaventa, 
he cannot be prime minister. Does that mean that if he wins he 
can be? 
  [Bossi] No, I think that Berlusconi is intelligent and will 
not even ask to be. He has too many private interests to be 
able to act as head of government. 
  [Bei] The first step after the poll will be the election of 
the speakers in the two houses. Some people would even like to 
elect a new president of the republic ... 
  [Bossi] And quite right too, because President Scalfaro 
himself announced that he would resign once there was a new 
parliament. That being said, however, I do not believe that it 
is a matter of fundamental importance at the present stage.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dino Frescobaldi: "But Europe Remains </F>
Divided"] 
  [Text] The positive conclusion of the negotiations for the 
admission of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway to the 
European Union is certainly excellent news, especially in view 
of the present situation. But I wonder, disregarding official 
reactions, how the event has been received by the public in the 
countries of the East, which have been knocking on Brussels' 
door for some time. Will they perceive in it the raising of 
another barrier and a reaffirmation of the old divisions of the 
continent? Will they perceive in this enlargement to new 
members yet another reaffirmation of their status as 
second-class Europeans? 
  When the struggle between the east and west blocs ended, 
many 
predicted that the partitioning of the old Europe into two 
political areas would end soon, too. Unfortunately, anyone who 
follows the affairs of these countries, known until recently as 
the Iron Curtain countries, must now acknowledge that this 
prediction, if not groundless, was at least premature. In 
practice the division remains, and is perhaps growing sharper. 
Just as though, where once there stood the barbed wire and 
watchtowers of the so-called Iron Curtain, there is still an 
intangible but real barrier. In so saying, I am referring not 
only to the economic and commercial factors that are slowing and 
complicating the negotiations for some of these countries' full 
European Union membership. Nor do I want for the moment to talk 
about the prospects facing the major country of the East, that 
is, Russia, which now seems more uncertain than ever before. 
  Let us keep to the part of central East Europe that is 
closest to us and that we could therefore have expected to be 
within closer reach of the membership process. However, some 
problem signs have been emerging from there recently. They tell 
us that, despite everything, the two Europes remain distant, in 
spite of the hopes. They are political events that reveal the 
difficulty still being encountered by their governments' process 
of integration into the West European outlook and therefore 
suggest dangers of their lapse back toward more or less grim 
solutions. 
  Let us consider, first, the case of Hungary, that is, the 
country that in many respects seemed one of the most "ready" and 
best suited to inclusion in the West European circle. Recently 
several dozen journalists were dismissed by the state radio and 
television service without any explanation other than that their 
attitude was inconsistent with the government's. There is no 
doubt that Hungary is having to deal with some serious problems 
of conversion, including that of an inflation rate which is much 
higher than those of its the western counterparts and the need 
for foreign investments. We must also give credit to the 
successive governments since the collapse of communism for 
having curbed the internal radical nationalist tendencies, 
traditionally strong among a people who believe that they have 
always been sacrificed -- to a world conspiracy, on the subject 
of borders. Nevertheless, it is a bad sign, or at least a sign 
of precariousness, when a government takes issue with the 
representatives of the media. 
  Another warning has come from Slovakia. We must remember 
that when that country decided about three years ago to separate 
from Prague, there were some people in our country who regretted 
the fact, recalling that a similar separation took place in the 
Hitler era. But there were also some, starting with the League 
and other irresponsible people, who celebrated the event. The 
fact is that Slovakia is now in the midst of a political and 
economic storm. Its backwardness with respect to the 
neighboring Czech Republic is obvious, but the political 
repercussions are even more serious. Its leader, Vladimir 
Meciar, the former communist who donned a new nationalist guise 
and who promoted the split, has in turn been disowned by his 
supporters and forced to resign, so all the signs are that a 
period of turbulence and dangers has begun for this Eastern 
republic, too. 
  The situation with which Romania is grappling seems even 
more 
serious. When Ceausescu was brought down, for some days the 
whole world followed anxiously, live on television, what 
appeared to be a people's revolution. But how much news 
coverage is devoted now to events in Romania? The fact is that 
some sad things are happening in that country. The 1989 revolt 
is increasingly emerging as a mere palace coup planned and 
carried out within a single ruling class. Romania's economic 
situation has not made any decisive progress even from the dark 
days of the Conducator, with inflation running at around 200 
percent. Under these circumstances the two demagogic 
nationalist parties -- the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] 
and the PRM [Great Romania Party] -- are able to dictate their 
own terms, influencing the government with the threat of 
stirring up the people over the issues of nationality. Thus, 
after a brief pause during which it attracted the world's 
attention, Romania seems to have lapsed back into its Balkan 
oblivion. 
  We have left until last the recent good news about the 
conclusion of an agreement on Bosnia between Croats and Muslims 
for the formation of a federal republic. But will this be the 
much hoped-for turning point? Will it spell the end of the 
latest Balkan bloodbath? It is justifiable to express 
skepticism. It may be doubted that a diplomatic operation 
carried out in private far from the battlefields can actually 
disarm the opposing sides, can bury traditional rancors and 
hatreds revived in recent years by massacres of one home after 
another, one family after another. All the more, since there 
are still many unresolved issues. For instance, how can 
Slovenia and Croatia aspire to join the family of European 
peoples if they cannot even succeed in resolving their own 
modest dispute? 
  To conclude: The enlargement of Europe to the north (Sweden, 
Finland, Norway) and to the center (Austria) takes Europe to its 
furthest possible extent. But at the same time, it underlines 
the enduring division between the two Europes. It will take 
time before the other Europe frees itself from its old plagues, 
which are now revealing themselves in returns to 
authoritarianism and eruptions of nationalism.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas today met with members of the 
Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce. In a statement after the 
meeting, Denktas reported that the chamber officials briefed him 
on their contacts with the Greek Cypriot Chamber of Commerce and 
he, in turn, spoke to them on recent developments concerning the 
confidence-building measures package. 
  Denktas explained that the package was changed extensively 
in 
favor of the Greek Cypriots, adding that equality and balance 
must be secured. Denktas declared that he concurs with the 
chamber of commerce view to the effect that if the package is 
accepted in its present form, the benefit to the Turkish Cypriot 
side is practically zero. 
  Asked to comment on the Greek Cypriot administration 
spokesman's statement that the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International 
Airport matter is a minor issue, Denktas said that the 
disagreement or the difficulty is over basic issues and these 
cannot be termed as minor matters. Every issue and every 
article is serious and vital, Denktas went on, because if there 
is to be an agreement, it must be one that envisages 
well-intentioned cooperation and protects the rights of the two 
sides in a balanced way. He stated: Once the balance is upset 
and the door is opened to the advantage of one side against the 
other, we cannot achieve anything. Therefore, it is wrong to 
advocate that only minor issues are outstanding and that 
everything will be all right once these are resolved.

  [Excerpt] Hans van den Broek, European Union [EU] 
Commissioner on Foreign Affairs will have important talks on the 
Cyprus issue and Cyprus' relations with the EU. Van den Broek 
arrived here this evening accompanied by Serge Abou, the EU 
observer on the Cyprus issue. 
  Speaking upon his arrival, van den Broek said the EU and 
Cyprus are working together for Cyprus' EU accession. He said 
the Cyprus issue is dragging on and expressed the hope that 
Cyprus will be reunited. He also said that the EU's interest in 
a Cyprus solution became more pointed with the appointment of an 
observer to the talks. Van den Broek expressed regret that the 
talks are going through a difficult phase, as he put it, and 
called on the side responsible to cooperate with the Cypriot 
Government and United Nations, amend its position on the 
confidence-building measures, and cooperate for a political 
settlement. 
  Welcoming the EU commissioner, Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis expressed his deep gratitude and stressed that van 
den Broek has contributed decisively to historic beginnings for 
Cyprus, adding that it is hoped things will reach a successful 
conclusion with Cyprus' accession to the EU. Mikhailidhis also 
said that the EU commissioner's presence in Cyprus is very 
important. It is, he added, a political message indicating the 
importance of Cyprus' upgraded relations with the EU. [passage

  This is the police's evaluation after discovering evidence 
in 
Athalassa Forest during the search for the motorcycle used in 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder. Specifically, the police found a 
blue and white cigarette package of the Harman brand, which had 
the initials of the pseudostate [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] inscribed on it. There were 15 cigarettes inside the 
package, which was found near a National Guard military camp. 
  Police are examining the package, which is believed to 
belong 
to Turkish secret service agents who systematically watch every 
move to and from the military camps.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Deja Vu Over Talks"] </F>
  [Text] There was a sense of deja vu yesterday when UN envoy 
Joe Clark, announced after meeting [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf 
Denktas that, "I do not have the kind of agreement I require 
from the Turkish Cypriot side". It will be very difficult to 
find anyone on the island who would be in the least bit 
surprised by the news. But Clark, like his predecessors, refused 
to give up hope. "An option was raised at this morning's 
meeting that may make it possible for us to find an agreement 
and we are going to pursue that," he said, ignoring the fact 
that the latest effort was running out of time. The UN 
Secretary-General had set an end of March deadline, at which 
time he is expected to submit his report on Cyprus to the UN 
Security Council. 
  What happens in the more than likely event that the "option 
raised" yesterday comes to nothing? According to Clark, the 
Secretary-General's report would "indicate why we have not 
achieved progress". President Glavkos Kliridhis will get a pat 
on the back for his constructive contribution and acceptance of 
the UN package, while Denktas could be held responsible for the 
lack of progress. It is doubtful that Denktas would suffer any 
negative consequences for his stance; countries like Britain and 
the United States would argue, as they have always done after a 
deadlock round of negotiations, that punitive measures would 
only make the Turkish Cypriots less cooperative in future peace 
efforts. The absurdity of the argument is self-explanatory. 
  As we have always maintained, the United States, which more 
or less runs the UN Security Council, is not willing to 
jeopardise its good relations with Turkey for the sake of 
Cyprus. The same can be said of the British Government which 
has always had an active part to play in the peace process. 
This is why the UN has pandered to Denktas' whims ever since 
the Confidence Building Measures (CBM) were put on the table. 
Last May, Butrus Butrus-Ghali gave Denktas time to consult 
Ankara on the measures before giving his reply. The issue 
dragged on and no answer was given. We had to wait until after 
the elections in the north and then we had to wait for the new 
"government" to make up its mind. All this waiting, for Denktas 
to finally reject the UN proposals. Ironically it was the Greek 
Cypriots who had been repeatedly reminded, by every foreign 
official who visited the island, that the CBM was the last 
chance to achieve a settlement; as if it was the Greek Cypriot 
side which had stood in the way of progress. 
  Diplomats had this time pinned their hopes on pressure being 
put on Denktas by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller who was, 
reportedly, genuinely interested in the implementation of the 
measures. Some pressure was put on Denktas to make him discuss 
the measures, but alas, this glimmer of hope has already 
disappeared. Ciller, beset by domestic problems, is expected to 
emerge much weaker from Sunday's municipal elections in Turkey 
and will be in no position to apply pressure on anyone; 
political uncertainty in Ankara has always suited Denktas. 
  What happens now? Negotiations on the substance of the 
Cyprus 
problem are inconceivable after the CBM deadlock. If the 
Turkish Cypriot side is unable to show a modicum of goodwill 
that would allow the CBM to be implemented, it is impossible 
that a substantive dialogue could even get off the ground. It 
will be very interesting to see what Butrus-Ghali will make of 
all this in his report, and what new course of action, if any, 
he will take. Nothing drastic should be expected, especially 
now that Turkey has been invited to provide peacekeepers for 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ignoring the Lessons of History"] </F>
  [Text] The Greek Government has reacted strongly to the UN 
Secretary-General's recommendation to the Security Council that 
Turkish troops be sent to former Yugoslavia as peace keepers. 
Greece's objections are certainly not unreasonable, even though 
the West will dismiss them as yet another example of Greek 
nationalist hysteria and paranoia. How could the deployment of 
2,700 Turkish peacekeepers destabilise the Balkans, as Greece 
has been claiming, Western policymakers would ask. And why 
should Turkey's offer have been turned down considering the 
shortage of peacekeeping troops and the reluctance of most 
countries participating in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], to 
send more soldiers to former Yugoslavia? Countries like Britain 
and France, understandably, welcomed this move because it meant 
they would not have to send more soldiers to the Balkans. 
  Greece on the other hand has every right to complain. First, 
as Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias pointed out in his letter 
to the Security Council, the move went against "general 
principles applying in cases of sending special UN troops". 
These principles "are the nonparticipation of countries with 
some historical relation to war in the area and nonparticipation 
of neighbouring states," he said. Turkey might not be a 
neighbouring state, but it is very much part of the Balkans 
which it ruled, in the guise of the Ottoman empire for some 500 
years, until early this century. The "historical relation" 
cannot be denied. And neither could the possibility of 
destabilisation in the Balkans; Turkey will initially send 
almost 3.000 soldiers into former Yugoslavia, but the number 
could increase substantially in the future. 
  Then there is the Cyprus factor which has been completely 
ignored. It is an amazing paradox that Turkey, an occupying 
power for 20 years, can join a UN peacekeeping force in one of 
the most unstable regions in the world. This is a country whose 
1974 "peace operation" in Cyprus has meant the stationing of 30 
to 40 thousand troops and some 300 tanks on the island ever 
since. And all indications are that it has no intention 
whatsoever of withdrawing them. Admittedly, it will be 
extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Ankara to do the 
same in former Yugoslavia, but that is not really the issue. 
The fact is, the UN Secretary-General should not have even 
considered the sending of Turkish troops as an option, bearing 
in mind the situation in Cyprus and Turkey's blatantly negative 
role in UN-sponsored attempts to find a settlement. This makes 
it quite clear that neither the Secretary-General, nor the UN 
Security Council consider Turkey has any responsibility for the 
division of Cyprus and repeated failures to achieve a settlement. 
  Obviously such trivialities are not given a second thought 
by 
the Western powers, all of which enjoy excellent relations with 
Turkey, a reliable and dependable ally. In the case of former 
Yugoslavia, the Security Council is also trying to keep 
satisfied the Muslim countries, which were angered by the 
deployment of Orthodox Russian peacekeepers. Now, with the 
arrival of the Turks, there is a balance in the peacekeeping 
presence, at least in the eyes of the Muslim world. As for 
Turkey, sending troops will help it to promote itself as a 
country which works for peace and stability in the region, 
despite the increasingly brutal tactics it is using to suppress 
the Kurdish revolt in the southeast and the continuing 
occupation of Cyprus. 
  As one foreign ministry official in Ankara gloated yesterday 
regarding the sending of troops to former Yugoslavia: "We're 
very pleased with this. Yet another confirmation of Turkey's 
position as a country which works for peace and stability in the 
region."

  [Text] In Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is 
meeting Nurulstan Nazarbayev, president of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, with whom he will hold a joint news conference on 
his state visit to Spain. 
  Nazarbayev will have lunch with Gonzalez and will visit the 
Senate and the Madrid town hall during this second day of his 
official visit to Spain. 
  On 23 March, during the dinner held in honor of President 
Nazarbayev, King Juan Carlos I of Spain highlighted his 
appreciation of Kazakhstan's contribution to stability in Europe 
and the world -- a contribution made by joining the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty and by signing disarmament treaties. 
  Earlier, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and his 
Kazakhstan counterpart signed agreements that form the legal 
basis for cooperation. Solana announced that the Spanish state 
will guarantee credits of up to $25 million for Spanish exports 
to Kazakhstan.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer Ana Blanco] A couple of minutes ago, 
during the joint news conference he held with the president of 
Kazakhstan, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said that the 
challenge posed by the violent act in Mexico will be dealt with 
calmly by the Mexican peoplen without having to change the 
functioning of their democracy. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The institutions in Mexico can 
take this very strong blow. So despite this terrible act, the 
process that is under way will continue nonetheless. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent Amalia S. Sampedro] After underlining the 
political and economic importance of Kazakhstan for the 
stability of Russia and its surrounding area, Prime Minister 
Gonzalez outlined his support for the Cuban liberalization 
process. He said Spain would continue to help. He was hopeful 
that a free economy would herald a society with more freedom. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I think a free economy leads to a 
society with more freedom. I have always said that. I do not 
say that there is a casual effect, because I never have said 
that the market is a sacred cow. This is a process that has to 
be treated with enormous respect and with considerable calm.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister </F>
and PSOE secretary general, given to Radio Nacional on 17 March: 
"Gonzalez Asserts That Economy Is Now Growing and That Crisis 
Will Be Surmounted Despite People's Party"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday 
showed moderate optimism about the performance of the Spanish 
economy. He asserted that the crisis has begun to be 
surmounted, but did not hazard dates for reflecting growth in 
job creation. He condemned the leading opposition party's 
stance as "defeatist," because it asserts that "we will not 
emerge from the crisis because the government is incompetent. 
This argument will turn against them when people realize that 
we are emerging from the crisis." "We will emerge from the 
crisis without the People's Party," the prime minister said. 
  Gonzalez described the situation by asserting that the 
crisis 
bottomed out a year ago, and now we have begun the upturn, 
thanks especially to a number of very realistic economic 
measures -- lowering of interest rates, a new peseta exchange 
rate, combating the deficit -- which provide a more favorable 
framework for investment, and hence for job creation. Gonzalez 
made these statements during the interview he granted to Radio 
Nacional 24 hours before his party held its congress, which is 
intended precisely to give an impetus to the government policy 
aimed at economic recovery. 
  On this issue, the prime minister adopted a very 
down-to-earth approach, not expressing great expectations, but 
demanding of society in general and his party in particular that 
they understand the absolute value of competitiveness as the 
sole springboard capable of ensuring not just economic recovery, 
but the welfare state's very survival in the medium-term. 
  The Socialist leader also mentioned the importance of 
structural measures, and emphasized the need to broaden the 
country's production base, an aim to which the current labor 
reform is geared. Gonzalez spoke emphatically in this part of 
the interview, trying to be especially persuasive, aware of the 
opposition to these changes, which was most forcefully expressed 
in the 27 January strike. 
  In the opinion of Gonzalez, it is clear that unemployment 
remains the country's main problem. In order to combat it, it 
is necessary to "break down the barriers" impeding access to the 
labor market and find new approaches to work. Broadening the 
production base, having more people working, should make it 
possible to "maintain solidarity programs," including pensions. 
Gonzalez tried to reassure current pensioners by asserting that 
they are guaranteed "a decent income." Nevertheless, he added 
that a debate on possible ways to maintain these benefits in the 
future should not be ruled out. To this end, he stressed, it is 
necessary to ensure "growth" and "competitiveness" -- a word 
which he repeated. 
  The prime minister maintained that thes debate on the future 
of the welfare state should be governed by "seriousness" and 
"responsibility," especially in a ruling party. Here there was a 
very direct appeal to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
to renounce all dogmatism in the reformulation of Socialist 
doctrine. The values to be defended are still, he argued, 
freedom, solidarity, and social justice, embodied in services 
such as the education and public health systems and pensions. 
In order to embrace those principles and safeguard these 
systems, however, it is necessary to act with "realism" and with 
"imagination." Therefore, the PSOE "cannot undertake to do 
something for which (the country) later cannot pay." 
  Spain needs, he also said, "lively enterprises," able to 
compete on international markets. Our country needs to win the 
"confidence" of investors and consumers daily, since it operates 
in an open economy. This year, "tourism, the construction 
industry, and the external sector will fare well." This 
situation must be viewed without the People's Party's 
"defeatism" and "alarmism," but with "concern" in the sense that 
"we cannot set all the bells ringing." 
  In the opinion of Gonzalez, wages must not "soar," nor must 
inflation be allowed to revive. He described as "wishful 
thinking" the alternatives of the People's Party, which, in his 
view, "is spinning yarns." He said he regrets that this is the 
stance "of a party with possible government responsibilities, 
because it has over 8 million votes." 
  On political dialogue, Gonzalez stressed that the dialogue 
with Convergence and Union -- a force with which there is a 
"fluid and serious" relationship, characteristics not shared, 
however, by "the opinions some people express on this" -- is 
going "quite well." 
  He also stated that he retains the "hope" that there will be 
no blocking with respect to the democratic impetus -- filling 
vacancies in institutional bodies. If this is not achieved, 
however, the government will adopt "measures." Gonzalez 
reiterated: "I am interested in the Spanish Government and 
European building viewed from Spain," not in playing a leading 
role in it from Brussels. He said in conclusion that he will 
stay on "as long as the public puts up with me."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial report] An article in the 4 March Lisbon weekly 
TAL &amp; QUAL reports that Socialist Party (PS) official Mario 
Sottomayor Cardia, a former deputy and former minister of 
education who recently announced his candidacy for the 
presidency of the Republic, "disregarded the rule that a 
candidate should not reveal his intentions until the last minute 
to avoid attracting premature partisan support that may later be 
withheld, or spare himself the ridicule of a quick preelectoral 
defeat." According to the article, he is now beginning a "long, 
lone road without the protective embrace" of the party he helped 
found and lacking the benefit of President Mario Soares' 
blessing. While a "polemical and disturbing" Sottomayor Cardia 
may never become president, by announcing his candidacy the PS 
official is compelling parties and politicians to "question 
themselves" and prove that "individual initiative is not dead in 
Portugal." 
  According to an article by Isabel Oliveira in the 25 
February 
Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, friends of former President 
Ramalho Eanes "have convinced him that he meets all the 
conditions to be a presidential candidate again." The former 
president even received the conditional support of PSD [Social 
Democratic Party] luminary Alberto Joao Jardim, Madeira regional 
president, and Center Social Democratic (CDS) party official 
Nuno Abecasis, a former mayor of Lisbon, Oliveira notes. 
Additionally, "awareness-raising dinners" are held around the 
country to bring together Ramalho Eanes's old partisans and 
define strategies. Oliveira also affirms that the former 
president has met alone with Cavaco Silva. While she cites 
sources close to the prime minister as saying that the subject 
of presidential elections was not raised during the meeting, 
Oliveira comments that Cavaco Silva, now certain that Ramalho 
Eanes will run, was especially pleased when his interlocutor 
"confided" to him that his first step will be a strong attack 
against Mario Soares, a strategy Cavaco Silva indeed 
"appreciates," she concludes. 
  Writing in the 1 March Lisbon weekly O DIABO, Nuno Rogeiro 
reviews the possible presidential candidacy of Lisbon mayor and 
PS luminary Jorge Sampaio. The mayor is the first to "cross the 
Rubicon" of the presidential elections by "tactfully" implying 
in an interview in the Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO that "if [Prime 
Minister] Cavaco Silva is a man, let him face me for Belem 
[presidential palace]." According to Nuno Rogeiro, it must be 
acknowledged that Sampaio is presently the sole candidate "able 
to attract [votes] and indeed to increase [them]." Sampaio can 
attract because he possesses "impeccable" antifascist 
references, because he was "never tempted to give in to 
`Cavacoism,'" and because he is an efficient counterweight to a 
renewed majority of the PSD. Similarly, Sampaio can increase 
votes because he can point to his accomplishments in Lisbon, 
"possesses the puritan stance appreciated by Portuguese 
conservatism," and can discuss "practical and palpable" 
subjects, Nuno Rogeiro continues. However, Sampaio can only 
prove a winning candidate if, on the left, there are no other 
strong and divisive candidacies such as Eanes's, and if there is 
a "logic of bipolarization" with the right through a possible 
Cavaco Silva candidacy. However, bipolarization can fail if the 
prime minister consolidates his power in the legislative 
elections, a victory that may obviate his "presidential 
appetite," Nuno Rogeiro concludes. 
  The results of a presidential preference countrywide 
computer-assisted telephone interview poll conducted by 
Euroteste-VISAO on 23-25 February among 1,427 individuals 
appeared in the 3 March Lisbon weekly VISAO. Respondents were 
asked to name their choice for president. Prime Minister Cavaco 
Silva headed the list with 29.7 percent of the vote, followed by 
Ramalho Eanes with 17 percent, Jorge Sampaio with 15.7 percent, 
Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes with 7.5 percent, and former Prime 
Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao with 3 percent. Coimbra 
University Rector Rui Alarcao and PSD luminary Eurico de Melo 
received 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Some 6.2 
percent chose none of the candidates, 1.5 percent would not 
vote, 12.7 percent did not know, and 4 percent did not answer. 
Despite Cavaco Silva's success, however, the Portuguese would 
prefer him to remain prime minister. In fact, 51.6 percent of 
the respondents would not want him to be a candidate for the 
presidency whether he wins or loses the legislative elections, 
while only 15.2 percent would like him to run. 
  The importance of the 1995 presidential elections is rather 
small, and is derived from the legislative elections, themselves 
of an "alarming simplicity," writes Jose Pacheco Pereira in the 
5 March Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. The PSD either wins an absolute 
majority and Cavaco Silva remains as prime minister, or it loses 
the majority and a melee ensues. The issue of the candidates is 
equally simple, he adds. If the PSD holds an absolute majority, 
it can govern with any president, it being "irrelevant" if the 
Left captures the presidency. All leftist parties would then be 
"convulsed," mainly the PS, "where heads would roll," Pacheco 
Pereira argues. On the PSD side, the party has no interest in 
choosing a candidate "who would create more problems for the PSD 
than he could solve," as Ramalho Eanes would. In fact, the 
former president would cause deep internal divisions in the PSD 
even with the "direct or disguised" support of Cavaco Silva, a 
support that Pacheco Pereira, however, thinks is highly 
unlikely. In contrast, were the PSD to lose its absolute 
majority and become the opposition, the presidential issue would 
be so different that long-term predictions are of little help at 
this time, he observes.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Socialist Party Secretary General </F>
Antonio Guterres by unidentified TVI correspondent on 14 March: 
"Referendum for Belem Palace"] 
  [Excerpts] Distraining the Antas Stadium was a reversal of 
priorities in a country where "tax evasion is widespread." This 
was how [Socialist Party (PSP) Secretary General] Antonio 
Guterres commented on the affair of the moment on TVI, in an 
interview in which he accepted the possibility of holding an 
internal referendum in order to select the PSP candidate for the 
presidential election. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  "Primaries" To Select Candidate for Belem Palace </H5>
  In yesterday evening's interview with journalists Artur 
Albarran (TVI), Jaime Antunes (editor of SEMANARIO ECONOMICO), 
and Luis Delgado (assistant editor of DIARIO DE NOTICIAS), 
Antonio Guterres accepted the possibility of holding an internal 
referendum in order to select the party's candidate for the next 
presidential election. 
  "If necessary," Guterres stressed, "the Socialists could 
hold 
a kind of presidential `primary,' especially if it transpires 
that there are several would-be candidates within the party." 
  For the present, the Socialist leader asserted that he will 
not be "distracted by the issue" of the presidential election, 
because his main aim is the legislative elections. 
  With respect to those elections, Guterres reaffirmed that 
the 
PSP will run alone, planning to win an overall majority. 
  What if, while winning the election, it does not achieve 
that 
majority? That was the unavoidable question. Will it make 
alliances? With the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party] or with 
the Social Democratic Center Party? 
  Guterres accepted the possibility in that event of trying to 
"find the essential forms of cooperation within the 
parliamentary framework." One thing is certain: "I will not be 
stubborn; I will not go home, as the prime minister would do." 
  Before the election, he gave his assurance, there will be no 
alliance with the PCP, partly because "the PSP and the PCP will 
get more votes if they run separately than if they run together." 
  "Left-wingers will realize that the best way to defeat the 
Social Democratic Party will be to vote for the PSP," he 
asserted. 
  With respect to the PCP, he said that "if it evolves, it 
could become a credible party." And evolution, in Guterres' 
opinion, means introducing the secret ballot in its internal 
life, accepting the rationale of the market, and changing its 
pessimistic view of Europe. 
  The elections to the European Parliament were another 
unavoidable topic for this interview, at a time when the PSP is 
the only one of the major parties that still has no list leader. 
<H5>  European List Leader After Weekend </H5>
  But Antonio Guterres had no news to give on TVI: "The 
selection of candidates for the European Parliament will not be 
made before next weekend's National Convention," he repeated. 
  Nor did Mario Soares' alleged criticisms of his conduct as 
party leader draw many words from Guterres. 
  "The country has problems too grave to waste even a minute 
on 
intrigues," the Socialist leader said: "What concerns the 
Portuguese people most is employment, pay, and their children's 
education, and those are the issues which concern the PSP." 
  With respect to the next revision of the Constitution, 
Antonio Guterres showed himself, like Cavaco Silva, in favor of 
retaining the post of minister of the Republic for the 
autonomous regions and opposed to revising the powers of the 
president of the Republic. What is essential, he said, is to set 
up municipal police forces.

  [Text] Free trade between Finland and the Czech Republic 
will not end even if Finland becomes a member of the EU 
[European Union]. The Czechs have been concerned that the 
KEVSOS [expansion unknown] agreement between Finland and the 
Eastern European countries would not be valid if Finland joined 
the EU. 
  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who is visiting Finland, 
and Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho held talks on trade between 
the two countries in the morning. According to Finland, the 
ending of the KEVSOS agreement can be replaced with agreements 
between the EU and the Czech Republic if Finland joins the EU.

  [Text] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari received Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs in the presidential palace in Helsinki today. Zdenka 
Kardum reporting from Helsinki: 
  [Kardum] Finland has been intensely following all 
developments in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has been 
present in the area through its international peace negotiators 
and its UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the signing of the Washington 
agreement, Finland for the first time deems there is a 
possibility to restore peace in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This was stated following talks with Finnish President 
Ahtisaari in the presidential palace in Helsinki today by 
Granic. Granic described their talks -- which were held behind 
closed doors -- as interesting and open, stressing that the 
Finnish president was an expert on our area, as he was one of 
the negotiators at the international peace conference in Geneva. 
  Finland's share in sending humanitarian aid to Croatia has 
been considerable, and it is also ready to offer aid in the 
future, both in the humanitarian field and through the 
deployment of its UNPROFOR units. It is interested in 
comprehensive economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation 
with our country. Finnish President Ahtisaari has accepted an 
invitation from Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to visit our 
country. 
  Granic also had talks today with his Finnish counterpart 
Heikki Haavisto. Haavisto also accepted Granic's invitation to 
visit Croatia, on which occasion the two ministers are to sign 
agreements on economic, scientific, technical, and cultural 
cooperation. 
  The Croatian foreign minister has also met the chairman of 
the foreign affairs committee of the Finnish parliament and is 
expected to meet the Finnish parliament speaker in the course of 
the afternoon.

  [Excerpts] Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is hopeful 
about the possibilities for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
However, Granic does not believe that the Bosnian Serbs would 
want to join the federation negotiated by the Muslims and Croats 
on an equal basis. Granic also foresees difficulties in 
negotiations with the Serbs in Krajina. Antti Halinen reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Halinen] Granic, who was on a short visit 
to Helsinki, said that he is hopeful about the agreement on a 
federation signed by the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. 
  [Granic, in English] Concerning the future federation 
between 
the Muslims and Croats, I am optimist. 
  [Halinen] The situation there is better day by day. 
According 
to Granic, arrested people have been released, aid convoys can 
move again, and the confidence-building has started again. I 
think that the great majority of the Muslims and Croats supports 
the agreement, Granic says. 
  [Granic, in English] I think that very strong majority 
Muslims and Croats support it, the future federation. 
  [Halinen] Granic believes that the Bosnian Serbs will join 
the negotiations, but there are not many signs that they would 
join the agreement between the Muslims and Croats on an equal 
basis. [passage omitted] 
  According to Foreign Minister Granic, the first task is to 
create a lasting and universal cease-fire. According to Granic, 
the main problem in the negotiations with the Krajina Serbs is 
that they do not want autonomy but an independent state, and 
that is out of the question. 
  [Granic, in English] Definitely no state in the state, I 
told 
yesterday and two days ago... 
  [Halinen, interrupting] According to Granic, Croatia is 
prepared to grant the Krajina Serbs a local autonomy that is 
internationally monitored in two areas, but Croatia will not 
negotiate on regional integrity and sovereignty. Behind the 
unbending attitude of the Krajina Serbs is the support of Serbia 
and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, according to Granic. 
Granic says that more than 7,000 men and a lot of military 
equipment came from Serbia during last year to help the Serbs in 
Krajina. That is why it is not easy to find a solution in the 
negotiations without Belgrade's cooperation, Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic says. [end recording]

  [Text] The decision on when the Norwegian referendum on EU 
[European Union] membership is to be held could be of crucial 
importance for its outcome, a poll published yesterday in the 
newspaper NATIONEN shows. According to the poll, the yes side's 
only hope is that both Sweden and Finland vote in favor of 
membership before the Norwegian referendum. 
<H5>  Sweden's and Finland's Decision Is of Great Importance </H5>
  Some 55.7 percent of those who took part in the poll said 
that they will vote against Norwegian membership if the Swedes 
and Finns have also done so. Only 19.4 percent would vote yes 
under such circumstances. 
  If Finland decides to become an EU member while Sweden 
remains outside the Union, 48.3 percent would vote against and 
24.1 percent for Norwegian membership. 
  If both Finland and Sweden joint the EU, 39.9 percent of 
Norwegians would vote against membership. Under such 
circumstances almost the same number of Norwegians -- 37.5 
percent -- intend to vote for membership. 
  The poll is the first which has taken the referendums in 
Finland and Sweden into consideration. It was carried out over 
the past week. 
  The Norwegian referendum is likely to be arranged for 
November or December.

  [Excerpts] Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's foreign 
minister, says that his country has reached a historic juncture. 
In two to three years Iceland must decide whether the country 
will be linked to Europe or the United States. The decision is 
not easy, and a debate on the country's future is only just 
beginning. Pirjo Auvinen continues from Reykjavik: 
  [Auvinen] The Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian negotiation 
results with the European Union [EU] surprised even Icelandic 
Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson. By his own words, he 
could not imagine that agreement would be found so quickly. 
Hannibalsson said however, that he was even more surprised by 
the negotiation result achieved by Norway. According to him, it 
is much better than expected and is in fact good. Finland's and 
Sweden's EU membership is chiefly an academic matter for 
Iceland, which lives off fish and fish processing. On the other 
hand, Norway's potential membership in the EU brings Iceland to 
a historic situation, in the Icelandic foreign minister's own 
words. 
  [Begin Hannibalsson recording in Swedish-Norwegian] [words 
indistinct] it is clear that Iceland is at a historic juncture, 
and we do not yet know in what direction we want to go. [end 
recording] 
  [Auvinen] According to Foreign Minister Hannibalsson, 
Iceland 
must choose between two alternatives: Either it seeks 
membership in the EU like the other Nordic countries or it seeks 
to strengthen its current EEA [European Economic Area] treaty by 
concluding a free trade agreement with the United States and 
Canada. [passage omitted] 
  According to Hannibalsson, by present prospects, Iceland 
cannot seek EU membership until after the big EU conference in 
1996, but creating closer relations than at present with the 
United States would not be easy either. The foreign minister 
yesterday handed a report assessing those difficulties to the 
Icelandic parliament. 
  Hannibalsson admits openly that Iceland may be drifting into 
a very isolated position. Its opportunities to exert influence 
will be reduced, and the Nordic cooperation, which is important 
to Iceland, will move beyond its reach. [passage omitted] 
  According to Hannibalsson, the decision on which direction 
Iceland will take in future must be made quickly, in two to 
three years.

<F P=106> [Article by Elisabeth Grona: "Harsh Words About Policy </F>
Towards the East: Schori and af Ugglas on a Collision Course in 
Riksdag Debate"] 
  [Excerpt] Who is playing Russian roulette with Swedish 
foreign policy? 
  The government is with its Baltic policy and its talk of the 
need for shock therapy for Russia, replied Pierre Schori (Social 
Democratic Party [SDP]). 
  Pierre Schori is, with his talk of missile attacks on 
Belgrade and his quotes from confidential telegrams from Moscow, 
said Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas (Moderate Party). 
  Wednesday's [23 February] foreign policy debate in the 
Riksdag turned into a tense showdown between af Ugglas and her 
challenger for the foreign minister's position after this fall's 
elections. Schori called for an active Swedish policy in the 
former Yugoslavia but more thought regarding the Baltic and 
Russia. Margaretha af Ugglas emphasized consultation with other 
countries on the war in the Balkans but advocated an active 
policy in the Baltic. 
<H5>  Political Burden </H5>
  Schori quoted from a report from Orjan Berner, the Swedish 
ambassador in Moscow, who warned the government about economic 
and foreign policy advice to the Russians. Given the current 
uncertain situation, each comment could become a political 
burden for Sweden. 
  "Where is the gentleness and the care when Schori quotes 
from 
confidential documents?" the foreign minister wondered. 
  This year's foreign policy review was dominated by the 
European Union [EU], the war in Bosnia, and developments in 
Russia and the Baltic. The government made a clear distinction 
between its policies and a former foreign policy line: 
  "What we want to achieve is an arrangement that has freedom 
and democracy as its foundation. The many attempts during the 
Cold War to create detente and cooperation across blocs were all 
based on conceptions of coexistence between systems with freedom 
and lack of freedom." 
  However, developments in Russia, especially talk of "the 
country next door," are cause for uneasiness: 
  "We can now understand tendencies toward a return to a more 
traditional model of tensions," the foreign minister said as she 
spoke in some detail about the Baltic countries. The alleged 
abuses of human rights there are baseless, she said: 
  "Protestations to the contrary serve no constructive purpose 
but rather risk being seen as pieces in a power policy." 
<H5>  Seeks Generosity </H5>
  At the same time, she counseled those countries to be 
generous towards their minorities. And, as Carl Bildt before 
her, the foreign policy review pointed to an active policy 
towards the East: 
  "We can never sit by indifferently when there are 
developments that carry threats against either Russia's 
democracy or the independence of the Baltic states." 
  Schori accused the government of "diplomatic conformity and 
political passivity" in foreign policy. Gone are the creativity 
and the determination, he said, taking the former Yugoslavia as 
his first example: 
  "That must be the area closest to our hearts and the main 
goal of our actions." 
  But, on the other hand, with respect to Russia and the 
Baltic, Schori would like to see more thought and consultation: 
  "It is more urgent than ever before to put simplified 
notions 
about shock therapy behind us. The government cannot privatize 
policy towards the East." 
  Schori went on to criticize the government for lacking the 
determination to put effort into a Swedish seat on the Security 
Council and for providing support to the East that was 
squandered and uncoordinated. On the whole he saw foreign policy 
as an extension of domestic policy, even on the issue of the 
European Union: 
  "It is hard to expect that a government that is trying to 
disarm Sweden socially will work on behalf of social rearmament 
in Brussels." 
  "Schori's tone is pathetic," Margaretha af Ugglas replied. 
"Where are the alternatives?" 
  Schori referred to Liberal Party criticism of "impotence" in 
Bosnia and "distance from the slaughter in Bosnia." 
<H5>  Broad Consensus </H5>
  Instead Daniel Tarschys (Liberal Party), the chairman of the 
standing committee on foreign policy, emphasized the large 
measure of partisan political consensus on the issue of 
Yugoslavia. And Par Granstedt (Center Party), who took part in 
his last foreign policy debate, wondered why the Social 
Democrats want to have a confrontation over foreign policy. 
  Schori replied saying that the center parties, unlike the 
Moderates, stand for traditional Swedish foreign policy. 
  Invite Zhirinovskiy here and tell him that we will not stand 
by passively and see Russia threaten the Baltic, Christer Winden 
(New Democracy) suggested. 
  "Trying, through EU membership, to create a European 
security 
arrangement is the worst way to respond to a Russian threat," 
said Bertil Mabrink (Left Party). "That just makes Russia more 
uncertain." 
<H5>  Quotations of an Unusual Sort </H5>
  Pierre Schori will probably go down in history as the first 
person to have read from a letter to the foreign minister from a 
Swedish ambassador in an important neighboring country in the 
Riksdag's chambers. 
  What Schori quoted to the chamber and foreign ambassadors 
from the speaker's lectern was a handwritten letter to Foreign 
Minister Margaretha af Ugglas dated 5 January of this year from 
the Swedish ambassador to Moscow, Orjan Berner. 
  In a longer report, Berner summarized his assessment of the 
current situation in Russia and gave the foreign minister seven 
pieces of advice, sources at the Cabinet Office and Ministries 
told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA. 
  Piece of advice number seven, the last one in the letter, 
alluded to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's statement about the need 
for more shock and less therapy in Russia. Schori quoted 
Ambassador Berner's assessment. 
  "Exercise caution about talking about any economic policy 
advice. No matter how right and legal the shock therapy warnings 
may be, they are a political burden." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Michelsen: "`Without the European Union, </F>
the U.S. Is the Alternative'"] 
  [Text] What security policy can Sweden have if the Swedish 
people votes no on the European Union [EU]? If they do, we must 
rely on the United States. That is the only alternative, writes 
Associate Professor Bengt Sundelius in a debate piece on our 
future security policy. 
  Together with Iceland, Norway, and perhaps Finland, Sweden 
could develop into a U.S. stronghold on the edge of what in 
security policy terms is an increasingly independent Europe, 
Sundelius believes. He himself believes that the safest thing 
for Sweden is joining the EU. But what if that does not happen? 
What do we do then? 
  This is an issue that has so far been advanced in the EU 
debate. Bengt Sundelius, a political scientist living in 
Stockholm, is the first one to construct a detailed argument 
about this alternative. It is an exciting piece in the booklet 
"Sveriges sakerhetspolitiska vagval" ["Sweden's Security Policy 
Choice"] published by FOLK OCH FORSVAR. 
  Sweden has become smaller and weaker in relation to its 
neighbors, Sundelius points out. Even during the 1960's, Sweden 
was one of the major states in Europe. We had a big, strong 
economy and a powerful defense force that acted as a stabilizer 
in northern Europe. Since then we have turned from a North 
European superpower into one small state among [many] others. It 
is just as well for us to acknowledge that. Our economy looks 
the way it acts. Nor, for that reason, is it likely that we will 
be able to pay for a defense force that can deter the rest of 
the world. 
<H5>  Border State </H5>
  If we end up outside the EU, we will become a border state, 
EU supporters contend. No, quite the opposite, we will become a 
happy island, say those who say no to the EU in the debate. But 
both sides are conducting too superficial a debate, Sundelius 
says. In fact, Swedish isolation in the future is completely 
unrealistic. But who can we really cooperate with in our 
security policy? 
  Perhaps with a newly democratic Russia? No, that is not 
likely. The Russian mess is too great. And above all, we lack a 
basic community of values with Russia's leader and people, 
Sundelius says. 
  If we say no to cooperation with Europe, the only thing 
remaining is to link up with our old connection across the North 
Atlantic. And if Sweden says no to the EU, Finland will do the 
same. We should be able to achieve something similar to the 
Scandinavian defense union that Sweden tried to implement during 
1948-49. And this union, which, in addition to Sweden, consists 
of Finland, Norway, and Iceland, would serve as a link to NATO. 
  Sundelius believes it is conceivable that the United States 
as well could see the benefits of such a North European security 
arrangement. No least owing to fears of an ever more independent 
EU. 
<H5>  Few Alternatives </H5>
  Many Swedes would prefer security policy cooperation with 
the 
United States, which has proven to be a tested ally in difficult 
situations, Sundelius believes. On the other hand, he does not 
believe that opponents of the EU within the Social Democratic 
and Left Parties and the environmental movement will like a 
linkage with the remaining superpower, the United States. But 
what else is there if going into the year 2000 we are sitting 
outside the EU and have a Russia that might pose a threat and is 
revanchist as a neighbor? 
  Ranged against Sundelus in the brochure are all of our most 
familiar security debaters. And the ingenuity [applied] was 
great when it came to finding terms of abuse for the old Swedish 
policy of neutrality. There is talk of a neutrality liturgy, 
long-term hysteria, and hidebound neutralists. There are jokes 
about Sweden as a once moral superpower. 
  A title that would have fit the contents might also have 
been 
"After Neutrality" had it not been for Par Granstedt (Center 
Party) and Anders Ferm (Social Democratic Party), who both warn 
against too rapid a revision of Swedish policy. Ferm's essay 
accomplishes its purpose very well. In the haze, you decrease 
your speed and navigate slowly and cautiously. The security 
policy milieu is hazy and uncertain, and the government is not 
navigating with sufficient caution, his thesis runs. 
<H5>  An Obvious Asset </H5>
  Generally speaking, all of the contributors believe that 
Swedish EU membership is an obvious asset for Swedish security. 
But several of them criticize the mumbling of politicians on 
this point. Where security policy is concerned, there is a 
democratic deficit. The biggest change in our policy in modern 
times has been initiated without reports and debate, Wilhelm 
Agrell, for example, believes. And together with him, many in 
the brochure call for clear answers in such processes. 
  So the stage is set for continued debate -- unless the 
politicians persevere in the "conspiracy of silence" of which 
they have been accused.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaa Eneberg: "Europe Missionaries Visit </F>
`Heathens'"] 
  [Text] Why is Gallivare in the interior of Norrbotten worth 
a trip in the dead of winter, when the weather does not even 
allow skiing? 
  Carl Bildt says urbanely into the local radio's microphone 
in 
the icy school playground that it is always wonderful to come 
here. But the truth is that he is uneasy, just as uneasy as 
opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson that the unruly people who 
mine ore will vote to a man against membership in the European 
Union [EU]. 
  That is why little Gallivare, with its 19,000 inhabitants, 
has become an attractive destination for politicians advocating 
a yes vote in the run-up to the national referendum. 
  Yet the prime minister is good at concealing his uneasiness. 
He explains and discusses, during visits to schools and at 
nighttime meetings, the fear Norrbotten residents have of the 
Brussels bureaucracy. The answer to almost every question, 
whether it pertains to the legal right of access to private 
land, hunting, alcohol, or support for Norrland, is consistently 
introduced with "we will decide that ourselves..." Next comes a 
speech outlining what the consequences of membership will be. 
So, for example, each EU krona provided to subsidize Norrland is 
a bonus that will get added to the usual Swedish subsidy. 
  Ingvar Carlsson, who was here last week, was less precise, 
but then he does not have the same direct channel to Brussels as 
Carl Bildt. He left it at saying that EU membership could only 
be positive for Norrbotten. 
<H5>  Opposition Decreases </H5>
  When the public opinion figures on EU membership were 
studied 
in detail one year ago, 75 percent of Norrbotten residents were 
definitely opposed. Moderate Party ombudsman Tommy Eriksson, 
Lulea, said that he had gotten "signals" that the opposition has 
now been pushed down to 60 percent. More people have become 
undecided. 
  "It will come down even more, and we hope we prevail with 
the 
help of our Moderate Party ministers in particular," he said. He 
has just scheduled Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik for a trip to 
Gallivare in April. Tax Minister Bo Lundgren has paid a visit, 
EC Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is thought to have done well for 
himself in Gallivare, while party secretary Gunnar Hokmark tried 
to make the people in Boden see reason. 
  Education Minister Per Unckel "will do Haparanda in May" and 
Industry Minister Per Westerberg is on the ombudsman's wish list 
for a longer visit. 
<H5>  Schools as the Key </H5>
  "All of Norrbotten is a challenge. That is obviously true in 
Gallivare, which is more communist than other places, with the 
Swedish Communist Party [SKP] still in power," said Eriksson as 
he rode about during the minister's visit. 
  During each visit Eriksson schedules a school. So each 
Moderate Party minister has obligingly stood at a lectern. 
Because it is among youth that they see an opportunity to win 
over the growing group of those who are undecided. In Gallivare 
Prime Minister Bildt ventured out on a fearless operation by 
urging youth "to listen and think for themselves," not to be too 
impressed by the naysaying older generation being understood. 
  The Moderates, who are supported by approximately 12 percent 
of the voters in the province, know they are somewhat frustrated 
by the other nonsocialist parties where winning Norrbotten 
residents over to the EU is concerned. 
  The Liberal Party is lying low, the Christian Democratic 
Party is heard from most often as being opposed, and when Labor 
Market Minister Borje Hornlund (Center Party) was with the prime 
minister in Karesuando, there was "only demonstrations and 
misery." Carl Bildt, on the other hand, went out and talked 
calmly with the unemployed who were demonstrating, telling them 
that the EC was not a danger but rather would produce jobs, not 
least in Norrbotten.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Enlargement -- Another Failure Hits </F>
the Twelve: European Union on Brink of Crisis"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 22 Mar (BELGA) -- The foreign ministers of 
the Twelve have once again failed in their attempt to reach 
agreement on the adjustment of the voting rules within the 
Europe of the Sixteen, thereby leaving the European Union (EU) 
teetering on the brink of a serious crisis, which could entail 
the very nature of European construction being called into 
question. 
  Meeting for the umpteenth time in Brussels, the ministers 
had 
to concede that there was a complete stalemate in their attempt 
to reconcile the point of view held by the British and Spanish 
with that of the other 10 member states on the adjustment of the 
blocking minority within the Council in light of the accession 
of the four new states. This furious debate will be postponed to 
the informal Council meeting of the Twelve, which will take 
place in Ioannina (in northern Greece). 
  That meeting will constitute the "final chance" to reach an 
agreement. In order to respect the date of accession of the four 
candidates, planned for 1 January 1995, the European Parliament 
(EP) must give its "assent" no later than during the May plenary 
session, because that is the last plenary session before 
Parliament is dissolved prior to the June elections. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes does not hold out much 
hope for the prospect of a solution being found between now and 
the weekend. "Unless a miracle occurs in Ioannina, enlargement 
will be postponed indefinitely, and the EU will suffer a severe 
loss of credibility, both internally and externally," he said 
during a news conference. Mr. Claes alluded in particular to 
the lack of comprehension and disappointment on the part of the 
four candidate member states faced with the recantations of the 
Twelve, and to the risk of a sanction by European voters during 
the upcoming European elections. 
  "Without wishing to overdramatize the situation, we must not 
underestimate the importance of this incident, which is calling 
into question the functioning of the very Community itself," he 
added. 
  "The very functioning of the Union is at stake: If the bar 
set for making decisions is raised, then the Community will 
merely become less efficient. Moreover, it could call into 
question the very nature of European construction, which would 
then be diluted, rather than consolidated," explained the 
Belgian foreign minister. 
  The United Kingdom and Spain are still rejecting the 
mathematical adjustment of the blocking minority from 23 votes 
out of 76 to 27 votes out of 90 upon the accession of Austria, 
Finland, Sweden, and Norway. In so doing, the respective 
national governments in Madrid and London are seeking to retain 
the possibility of three countries blocking a decision. 
  The Spaniards are prepared to accept a blocking minority of 
27 votes except in cases where a minority of 23 votes is formed 
by three countries totaling at least 100 million inhabitants, a 
proposal Mr. Claes deems inappropriate: "The demographic 
approach requires more detailed examination. What about a 
minority of less than 23 votes constituted by two large 
countries comprising 120 million inhabitants or more?" he asked. 
  London and Madrid have rejected all the compromise proposals 
presented up to now. The Union's Greek Presidency proposed 
adjusting the blocking minority to 27 votes, while providing for 
some form of conciliation with a view to reaching a consensus if 
a bloc of 23 votes is formed with a view to opposing a decision 
on a major topic. 
  Such a solution is feasible for the 10 other member states 
subject to the fixing of a "strictly limited deadline" and "with 
legal or institutional commitment," underlined Willy Claes. 
  This position is irreconcilable with the British demand that 
the need to reach a consensus within an unlimited period in the 
event of a minority falling between 23 and 27 votes be included 
in a protocol annexed to the Maastricht Treaty and ratified by 
the EP and the national legislative assemblies of the Twelve. 
  "The founding fathers of Europe showed us the way, and we do 
not intend to make concessions on principles as fundamental as 
these. The Belgian Government flatly refuses to make concessions 
on institutional management," continued the Belgian foreign 
minister. 
  According to him, European Commission President Jacques 
Delors has now intervened in the debate, threatening to "draw 
all possible personal conclusions if we have to make 
concessions that go too far" on this issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Andreatta on </F>
Enlargement Hitches"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 22 -- Italy's Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta Tuesday [22 March] urged his European Union 
[EU] counterparts to reach agreement on new decision-making 
rules when they meet in Greece next weekend. 
  In a communique issued after an EU foreign ministers' 
meeting 
failed to agree on changes to voting procedures after four new 
member states are admitted to the Union, Andreatta said "I 
believe that at the basis of the solution there must be a 
compromise between those members which, like Italy, wish to see 
a gradual political and economic integration between member 
countries and, on the other hand, an acceptance of some nations' 
concern to not allow the isolation of a minority which 
represents a significant part of Europe's citizens." 
  EU foreign ministers will gather in northern Greece this 
weekend for further talks on the voting procedure, which is 
holding up entry to the Union for Austria, Sweden, Norway and 
Finland. 
  With the four new members, who now seem unlikely to enter 
the 
Union on January 1, 1995 as planned, the number of votes in the 
council of ministers would rise from 76 to 90. Some nations, 
including Spain, want the blocking minority to rise from its 
current 23 votes to 27 votes, to reflect this increase. 
  The Europarliament, which would have to ratify the new 
memberships before they go to referendums in the countries 
involved, has already said that it will not accept a blocking 
vote of less than 27. The Parliament will be dissolved shortly, 
to allow for elections in June.

<F P=106> ["sz"-signed report: "Opposition to New Consulate in </F>
Canton"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- In view of the need to save money in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bonn, as well as a German 
diplomatic representation abroad, a dispute has arisen over the 
establishment of an additional German consulate in Canton. 
  During his visit to China last year, Chancellor Kohl 
surprised leading diplomats with his statement that another 
consulate should be established in Canton. Since Genscher's 
time in office, the idea of a consulate has appeared in 
diplomatic reports. This additional diplomatic representation 
is not necessary because, as a high-ranking German diplomat in 
China said: "Based in Canton, our economic interests will not 
be considered for a long time to come." 
  According to a diplomatic message, it would be possible 
neither to find suitable rooms there nor to promote economic 
interests, because German companies still conduct business from 
Hong Kong and intend to carry on doing so. Following the 
completion of the new highway, Hong Kong is only two hours from 
Canton. The German diplomats' argument is that two German 
consulates would be a waste of money. This would appear to be 
borne out by the fact that France, which was the only European 
country with a consulate in Canton until it was closed following 
weapons deliveries to Taiwan, has decided not to reopen its 
representation there. 
  A new German consulate in central and southwestern China 
(Wuhan or Chengdu) would be much more sensible than two 
neighboring consulates in south China and that is something that 
business circles have pointed out. Hong Kong, according to top 
diplomatic reports, will remain a "catalyst" for the development 
of China and even more so after the transfer of the territory to 
China in 1997. Diplomats, as well as business people, will be 
able to work on southern China from Hong Kong. What the report 
states with resignation is: "We now have to implement the 
chancellor's decision against our will."

  [Excerpt] Ankara--Amendment of the Montreux Convention, 
which regulates passage through the Turkish straits, is out of 
the question, officials from Turkey's Foreign Ministry said on 
Wednesday [16 March]. Officials say it is impossible to alter 
provisions of the Montreux Convention, which was signed on 20 
July, 1936 by Turkey, Russia, Britain, France, Bulgaria, Greece, 
Japan and Italy and concerns freedom of passage through the 
straits. However, they point out that a process for amending 
the convention should be set in motion to prevent this freedom 
of transit from leading to environmental damage. They note that 
work launched two years ago is still continuing and that the 
recent collision between the two Greek Cypriot vessels at the 
Black Sea entrance to the strait on Sunday night and similar 
incidents in the past have encouraged more work on the subject. 
Drawing attention to moves which give the impression that 
Turkey is in a way suspending the right of freedom of passage 
through the straits or is obstructing the exercise of that 
right, officials stress that no such situation exists. They 
note that subjecting vessels to certain rules and regulations 
and removing freedom of passage are two different issues. They 
add that including Russia, many countries and oil companies have 
been informed about the new safety rules for the straits which 
will be put into effect on July 1. They note that contrary to 
press reports, Turkey has not received any final objection or 
veto from Russia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- The president of the Iraqi 
National Assembly, Sa'di Mahdi Salih, on Thursday [24 March] 
asked France to open an office in Baghdad, taking another step 
forward in improving Franco-Iraqi relations. 
  Acknowledging a recent improvement in relations between 
Paris 
and Baghdad, Salih told AFP: "It is necessary that France takes 
a step forward and responds to the initiative that Iraq has 
taken." 
  Bagdad opened an office in Paris in September, the first 
since the two countries broke off diplomatic relations in 
February 1991 during the Gulf war. 
  Salih is leading a delegation of five Iraqi parliamentarians 
attending the 91st UNESCO interparliamentary conference taking 
place in Paris. 
  The recent developments in French policy towards Iraq have 
been "very positive," Salih said, as much in the recent string 
of visits between the two countries as in its recent 
"moderation" of its stance on Iraq as a member of the UN 
Security Council. 
  Salih said he was to meet French parliamentary speaker 
Philippe Seguin Friday and that he had had "other contacts" in 
Paris. 
  Iraq has been fighting hard to get the UN embargo on Iraqi 
oil sales lifted -- only to see it reimposed by the UN Security 
Council last week. 
  "There is no further justification for the embargo," Salih 
said, stressing the hardship it was causing the Iraqi people who 
"are starving to death." 
  During the course of the Iraqi's visit to Paris, which has 
raised protests from the Iraqi opposition abroad, French oil 
groups Total and Elf Aquitaine have held discussions with Iraqi 
officials over plans to develop two oil fields in southern Iraq 
once the UN embargo is lifted. 
  In New York Wednesday, the UN said it was planning a series 
of missions to Iraq to develop controls on its long-term 
military potential before there could be any question of lifting 
the oil sales embargo.

self-determination of the Kashmiri people has been endorsed by 
the UN resolutions, and a peaceful settlement of the issue on 
the basis of these resolutions will pave the way for normalizing

  Addressing the 91st Conference of Interparliamentary Union

reflects its desire for playing an effective role to promote the 
process of global peace, justice, and progress. He made it 
clear that Pakistan adheres to the norms of nuclear 
nonproliferation and reduction of arms at global level and it 
will accept any regional measure to prevent the proliferation 
nuclear weapons in South Asia on an equitable and impartial 
basis. The speaker said Pakistan wants to have a balance of 
power in the Indian Ocean so as to ensure peace in the region 
and utilize resources to eradicate extreme poverty, hunger, 
diseases, and unemployment. He said Pakistan condemns all sorts 
of terrorism and smuggling of narcotics and is playing an 
effective role in the international efforts to control them.

<F P=106> [Article signed WDN: "Paris and Washington Unite Against </F>
Low-Wage Countries -- `New Arguments for Age-Old Protectionist 
Rhetoric'"] 
  [Text] Paris/Brussels -- In the run-up to the crucial date 
of 15 April -- the day when the GATT agreement will be formally 
signed in Marrakesh, Morocco -- Paris and Washington are getting 
more in tune with one another. France and the United States 
want to act against low-wage countries which distort free trade 
and competition by their products, which they are able to keep 
cheap thanks to low wages and poor working conditions. 
  GATT Director Peter Sutherland is warning against 
"simplistic 
arguments, which look very much like the old protectionist 
rhetoric." 
  Everything points to the already very tense North-South 
trading relations coming under even greater pressure thanks to 
the new Franco-U.S. initiative. Washington and Paris want 
drastic action to be taken against countries which ignore 
international labor law and trade union rights. The arguments 
between the United States and Beijing about the link between the 
two countries' trade relations and the respect of human rights 
by China have not yet subsided before new trouble has broken 
out, this time with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and 
Singapore. In these low-wage countries there is no such thing 
as trade union rights; workers there work for starvation wages 
and children are still massively exploited. 
  After France and the United States made life difficult for 
one another for years during the GATT's Uruguay Round, it is 
striking how much they agree today on the low-wage countries. 
Both countries have a virtually identical position on the 
matter, and they want action to be taken -- if necessary with 
economic sanctions -- against countries which do not respect 
labor legislation recognized under international law. 
  The subject is on the agenda in the European Union (EU) as 
well. Yesterday European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan 
presented a report dealing with the question. Brittan is 
pushing the EU governments to take a joint position in 
Marrakesh. The European commissioner believes the EU must 
demand that the World Trade Organization, which will shortly 
replace the GATT, should pay considerable attention in the 
future to violations of trade union rights throughout the world 
and problems like child labor, mass forced labor by prisoners 
and other social issues. Nevertheless Brittan does not want go 
as far as the French and Americans. He wants nothing to do with 
a crusade to impose economic sanctions against low-wage 
countries. 
  That is also the opinion of GATT Director General Peter 
Sutherland. In a speech last week in Toronto, Canada, he warned 
against "simplistic demands for drastic trade remedies which 
show a great similarity to more conventional forms of 
protectionist rhetoric." 
  The new Franco-U.S. eagerness in social matters is arousing 
considerable resentment in international trade union circles. 
Dennis McShane, spokesman of the International Metal Workers 
Union in Geneva, pointed out that, at present, Asia was the 
"low-wage paradise par excellence -- without trade unions and 
with unacceptable social conditions -- for every European 
company which wants to avoid its social responsibilities and put 
every job in European industry at jeopardy." McShane pointed 
out how his federation had been campaigning in vain for years 
against the terrible social conditions in a country like 
Malaysia, where trade unions are not even recognized and where a 
company like France's Thomson presently employs more workers for 
very low wages than in its own country.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "A German Is To Administer </F>
Mostar"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- After a solid peace agreement for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the FRG Government is planning to help 
rebuild and administer the city of Mostar. Bonn government 
circles confirmed such intentions to DIE WELT. Hans Koschnick, 
former Bremen mayor and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
politician, is to manage the reconstruction of Mostar on behalf 
of the European Union [EU]. He is to take over the office of 
administrator for the capital of Herzegovina. The FRG 
Government proposed this to the EU partners, the Foreign 
Ministry reported yesterday. The 12 have not yet made a 
decision. SPD foreign policy expert Karsten Voigt stated that 
Koschnick has already agreed to the proposal. 
  In the Chancellor's Office it was stated that Koschnick is 
"an experienced politician," but a "personnel decision" has not 
yet been made in connection with the first plans for the Bosnian 
city. Moreover, it was learned from the Chancellor's Office that 
the whole Mostar project is "by no means settled yet." One is 
"in the first stages of planning." Nevertheless, it is regarded 
as certain that FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic 
Union) wants an active German contribution to the reconstruction 
in Bosnia. It can only take place within the European framework 
and in close cooperation with the EU partners. No military 
mission whatsoever is envisaged. Only civilian help after the 
signing of a peace agreement is under consideration. 
  In the planning phase, which is still going on, it is also 
discussed to send perhaps about 300 officers of the Federal 
Border Police as policemen to Mostar. However, there is still a 
controversy over this proposal. In government circles, one 
talks of "considerable objections." The fear of attacks by 
Serbian units is behind it. Moreover, the policemen would have 
to act as a force to maintain public order. This is problematic. 
  However, the development work of German administrative 
experts who are to support the German administrator for Mostar 
-- who is to be appointed -- is regarded as unproblematic. The 
employment of the Technical Assistance Office in the 
reconstruction of the city is also possible. Moreover, the 
Federal Government wants to repair a hospital in Mostar with 
civilian personnel.

Structural Aid Difficult in Burundi Without Stability"; as

  [Excerpts] Brussels, 25 Mar (BELGA) -- On his return from 
Albania on Friday [25 March], Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes told BELGA: "We will continue to assume our 
responsibilities in terms of humanitarian aid, but we have 
warned Bujumbura that it will be difficult to implement our 
policy for structural aid as long as there is no stability in 
the country. Stability is looking increasingly remote." 
  He added: "The Burundian Government must no longer have to 
bow to the dictate of the Army. I still believe that the 
presence of the 180 OAU troops could partially ensure the 
maintenance of a democratic system." 
  Mr. Claes, who recently visited Rwanda and Burundi, again 
said in substance: "I have warned the Burundian authorities 
that their attitude toward the Army, which clearly refused to 
accept a democratic solution, would lead to fresh 
confrontations." [passage omitted] 
  According to the latest news from Bujumbura, calm seems to 
have returned to the northern districts of the capital on Friday 
morning after violent clashes between Hutus and Tutsis.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister John Major, by Hugo </F>
Young, in the Cabinet Office on 24 March] 
  [Text] To interview John Major these days you sit opposite 
him at the Cabinet table. That's where he prefers to do most of 
his business. These are the least intimate of surroundings, but 
for the purposes of a discussion about Europe the 22 empty 
chairs serve a helpful purpose. The ghosts of Gummer and 
Redwood, Portillo and Heseltine, Clarke and Shephard flicker 
through the whispering gallery where the drama of Major's 
survival -- the pressures that define the choice he must now 
make -- is being acted out. 
  The prime minister, however, is not prepared to read the 
script that I and others have written. He doesn't see it that 
way. He denies that the politics of survival have anything to 
do with his stance on Europe. In his first discursive interview 
since the enlargement row began, he portrayed himself as a 
broker working for the European cause, who would probably get 
what he wanted, and of whom it was "fatuous" to assume he was 
doing it because he was being pushed around by sceptic bastards. 
  "There seems to be a position where on one day I'm a raving 
Europhiliac prepared to roll over and accept everything from 
Europe, and on the next day I'm a phobe supreme who is supposed 
to disagree with everything from Europe," he said. "The truth 
is of course a good deal more complex." 
  For a start, the enlargement negotiation and the matter of 
the blocking minority -- shalt 23 votes or 27 be enough to stop 
some thungs happening? -- was nothing new. "Time after time 
you'll find solutions are reached at the 59th minute of the 11th 
hour in the Community. It is not an unusual proposition. I am 
not complacent about the difficulties on this occasion, but I 
have lived through this before and I think it is perfectly 
possible that a satisfactory compromise will be reached." 
  He declined to speculate what this compromise might be. We 
were meeting on Wednesday [23 March] evening, just after a 
private audience of l922 committee members had misinterpreted 
him as talking about a "two-tier" solution. A false story, 
apparently. But how could we conceivably get the best end of a 
compromise when we had so few allies? 
  This was another misreading. Only Spain is a public ally, 
but "a number of other countries have indicated that they are 
prepared to compromise, that they don't see 27 as a take-it or 
leave-it offer. The Portuguese prime minister sat in the seat 
you're sitting on and made it perfectly clear that he thought a 
compromise was possible." 
  And later: "A minority feel very strongly about 27. A large 
number of them are prepared to compromise." 
  So there was reason for hope reminiscent, he said, of the 
optout on the social chapter during the Maastricht Treaty. That 
occasion is big in his memory. He plainly rates his negotiating 
ability highly. And his point of principle over the votes, he 
revealed, has a longer-term purpose. 
  "When we joined the Community, the blocking minority 
represented 30 per cent of the population of Europe. It has 
steadily crept up. At the moment it is 40 per cent, give or take 
a point something. If we move to 27, it would be over 41 per 
cent." This might be just for two years until the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference, called supposedly to sort out many 
big institutional issues. The British fear is that in those two 
years a raft of Euro social law, killing jobs, would bypass our 
unavailing veto. 
  But Major is just as fearfill of what will happen in 1996 
itself, and later. "When the Visegrad countries (Poland, 
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic) join, as I hope they will 
around the turn of the century, if we applied the same 
arithmetic we would be getting into the absurd position of 
Britain, Germany and France, who provide overwhelmingly the 
resources of the Community, being outvoted on the qualified 
majority voting (QMV) procedure." 
  In other words: "If you increase the 40 per cent now, it 
makes it more difficult to reduce it within a very short period 
in l966, and I think that poses very great problems." 
  Problems, moreover, not just for Britain. Here comes John 
Major, the self-proclaimed good European. "I don't accept the 
principle that the good European always accepts what happens to 
be the majority view on the day or the fashionable view of the 
moment." The good European, on the contrary, looked for policies 
that recaptured "the hearts and minds and enthusiasm that many 
people had for the Community a few years ago." 
  Hardly a sceptic formulation: perhaps not very historical 
either. Heart, in fact, is not where he any longer locates the 
enthusiasm. "The vast majority are Europeans not in their heart 
but in their head." 
  "Are you in your heart or your head?" I asked. 
  "I am very much a European in my head. I believe it is 
essential for the economic wellbeing across Europe." 
  "But not in your heart?" 
  "I am more a European in my head than in my heart, but I 
want 
to see Europe succeed." 
  This success, I put it to him, was now being imperilled by 
his tactics. If he was wrong about the compromise, he might 
delay, perhaps kill off, the enlargement Britain had promoted 
more keenly than anyone. This wasn't necessary, he said. "Even 
if it were genuinely impossible to reach an agreement, there is 
still no reason why the Community should not agree that the 
enlargement should go ahead on the present basis, knowing they 
can return to the debate after that, and in any event return to 
it in 1996." 
  A plausible, but surely disingenuous, suggestion. Designed, 
perhaps, to shift the blame for any delay on to the countries 
still insisting on the 27-vote block. "You can go ahead with 
23, as it is now, knowing it is going to be reviewed. The point 
I am making is that you do not have to agree a change in order 
to let these other countries in." 
  If the others won't wear this, Major has steeled himself to 
accept a delay. There were various trigger moments. "It is not 
imperative that it should be settled next weekend" (when the 
Foreign Ministers meet in loannina). But the Swedes, in 
particular, needed to get moving on their own parliamentary 
votes "a little while after Easter." 
  There was another limiting moment. "I think probably if you 
did not have an agreement until after the European elections, 
you could not have enlargement go ahead on the present basis. I 
would hope that will not be the case." 
  Nonetheless, delay is now evidently on the British agenda. 
"Enlargement is extremely important. It would be a great shame 
if enlargement were to be delayed. But that is what it is. It 
would be delayed. I very much hope it will not be." 
  "I believe we can reach an agreement that will mean it will 
not be. But there is an inevitability about enlargement of the 
Community. It is going to happen. I hope it is going to happen 
on 1st January next year. But because we are very much in 
favour of enlargement does not automatically mean that, on 
another particular issue, we surrender a British interest about 
which we feel strongly." 
  Any such inevitability is, of course, challenged by anxious 
leaders in applicant countries. They fear a catastrophic loss 
of momentum for what is already a tricky cause. To Major what 
seems to matter more is getting the European system right now. 
Time and again, he returned to the problems of those who 
already belong. 
  On the hard-edge politics of all this he gave a series of 
replies to scotch the wisdom of the moment. What about the 
European Parliament, often cited as the body most trenchantly 
defending the 27? Did he see it as infinitely flexible? "No. 
But I do think it is probable that if the European Council 
reach an accommodation the Parliament, who want enlargement, 
will accept that accommodation." 
  What about the parliaments of the other 11, who all have to 
ratify the deal? He'd learned over Maastricht that these 
assemblies posed little problem to their leaders. "I do not 
think there will be any difficulty with ratifying elsewhere in 
Europe whatever the Council agrees." 
  They were certainly less of a problem than the British 
Parliament. With this we reached the nub of Major's crisis, and 
the charges now being made against him: of duplicity, cowardice, 
desertion of principle kow-towing to the phobes, saving his own 
skin, retreating from the heart of Europe. 
  I pointed out there were certainly more Tories now pushing 
him not to compromise. This idea gets on his nerves. 
  "Can I mention a fallacy in that argument? The fallacy is 
that I am wholly reactive and only concerned with one side of my 
party or the other. It might perhaps occur to people that might 
feel pretty strongly myself about what was the right thing to 
do." If he hadn't felt pretty strongly, he wouldn't have 
brought back the Maastricht agreement, or seen it through 
Parliament. "It is simply fatuous to assume that I an only 
structuring what I believe we must do on QMV to take account of 
other people's views. I happen to be doing what I believe to be 
right." 
  He couldn't understand why taking a strong line for Britain 
was regarded as disgraceful The French did it all the time They 
were doing it even as we spoke, blocking an increase of seats in 
the European Parliament until a deal was signed guaranteeing the 
Parliament would stay in Strasbourg. 
  "Why is it," he added in seemingly genuine bemusement, "that 
only in this country is the debate conducted in these rather 
extreme terms of phobic and enthusiast?" 
  He might well ask. Between these wrenching pressures, he 
struggles for survival. Or so it seems. But he rejects an 
interpretation of current reality which is one of the few things 
almost every Tory politician now agrees on. 
  "If you're trying to pick up the stories that say I am 
deliberately trying to keep this going in order to bang a John 
Bull drum at the European election, I just have to say to you 
that is plain wrong." 
  "But it has a sort of John Bull effect." 
  "It is just plain wrong. I am concerned about the Community 
being a success. I am not interested in hauling the walls down. 
That doesn't mean I have to agree with every current fashion PR 
policy. But no, I am not seeking a campaign for partisan 
interest to damage the European Community, most emphatically 
not. I want it to have the respect and affection of people in 
this country." 
  Was there not a close connection between the party's fate in 
June and his own fate as leader? 
  "I have made it perfectly clear before that at the last 
election I was elected and the Conservative Party was elected, 
and I expect to contest the next election as leader of the 
Conservative Party and I will do everything to win it and I 
think we will." 
  "Do you feel certain you will be leader of the party at that 
time?" 
  "Indeed I will." 
  "If a lot of Tory MPs see in the European election that 
their 
own seats have gone, they're going to panic, aren't they?" 
  "The parliamentary party I don't believe will." 
  "That's a very confident statement. They don't seem exactly 
unified." 
  "This is all `if' stuff, isn't it?" 
  "You can't pretend it's an academic question." 
  "I have given you my answer as to what I expect." 
  In this conversation, the prime minister exhibited much 
calmness. He thinks nobody understands the EC better than he 
does, especially in negotiating mode. He hadn't intended to go 
to the brink like this, though it's hard to see how his tactics, 
once committed against a deal everyone else thought had been 
struck at Lisbon in 1992, could have any other outcome. Unless 
he's a good actor, which he may be, he doesn't recognise the 
stark terms -- Machiavelli on a bad day -- in which he's 
portrayed. Neither phobe nor phile, he equally rejects the 
choice of fool or knave. 
  He is, however, gambling. He intends to stay in Downing 
Street for the duration. He sincerely believes he is not 
sacrificing "Europe" to this end. And if he does, he will not 
believe it.

<F P=106> [Article by James Adams: "The Red Death: The Untold Story of </F>
Russia's Secret Biological Weapons"; described as "exclusive" 
excerpt from The New Spies, his forthcoming book] 
  [Text] Vladimir Pasechnik was born in 1937 in Stalingrad, a 
city soon to be ravaged by the second world war. He became one 
of the brightest young scientists in the Soviet Union, 
determined to use his talent in the cause of peace, never 
allowing his research in biophysics to play any part in the kind 
of destruction that had cost the lives of his family. 
  After graduation, he did research at the Institute of High 
Molecular Compounds in Leningrad, working on new antibiotics and 
treatments for supposedly incurable illnesses such as cancer. 
  In 1974 he was approached by a general from the Soviet 
Ministry of Defence with an irresistible offer: to set up and 
run a laboratory in Leningrad, with an unlimited budget to buy 
equipment in the West and recruit the best staff from all over 
the Soviet Union. It would be known as the Institute of Ultra 
Pure Biochemical Preparations. 
  For Pasechnik it was an opportunity to realise many of his 
most cherished ambitions in the fight against illness. His 
early research was promising; he felt he could produce a cure to 
some forms of cancer. Until then he had thought he would never 
have the resources to complete his work. Now he was being given 
the chance to develop one of the Soviet Union's most advanced 
laboratories in biotechnology. He accepted. 
  The fact that the offer came from the Ministry of Defence 
did 
not worry him unduly. In the Soviet Union, the military was the 
engine of most scientific research; it had the cash and the 
people to run it. Even if a scientific project had a strictly 
civilian application, the military was still in charge. It was 
the Soviet way. 
  From 1974 to 1981, Pasechnik built up his special 
laboratory, 
scouring the country until he had 400 people on his staff, a 
lavish budget and enough hard currency to give his scientists 
constant access to the latest biotechnological advances in the 
West. The laboratory began its work in 1981. Over the next two 
years Pasechnik realised the truth: far from being the heart of 
a new civilian research operation, he was at the centre of a 
vast network of factories and laboratories working on deadly new 
weapons of war. 
  "Officially we were involved in vaccine development and in 
producing preparations for protecting crops," said Pasechnik. 
"In fact, we were developing methods of production and 
equipment for a huge biological warfare programme." 
  To begin with, Pasechnik had little idea of the scale of the 
operation. Only later did he discover that, as well as his 
laboratory in Leningrad, there were two more in Moscow, two just 
outside it and one in Novosibirsk, all working on the same 
project. Five manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people were 
operating in other parts of the country. The operation, known 
as Biopreparat, had a budget of 200m roubles and tens of 
millions of American dollars a year. It was one of the best 
kept secrets of the cold war. 
  Its task was to develop new strains of diseases, more 
powerful than anything known to science and to produce them in 
aerosol form. The germ also had to be resistant to antibiotics 
available to the Nato armies of the West. The specific job 
allocated to Pasechnik's laboratory staff was to make them 
effective weapons of war: they had to find ways of delivering 
the germs by artillery shell, bomb or missile, to ensure that 
they had a long life in the open air and that they could be 
dispersed over a wide area. 
  The breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institute of 
applied microbiology at Obolensk, 60 miles south of Moscow. 
There, with the help of work done at Pasechnik's laboratory, 
scientists developed their first super-plague: a new strain of 
tularaemia. A severe infectious bacterial disease of man and 
domestic animals, carried by contact or insect bite, it is named 
after Tulare, California, where it was discovered. The tests on 
it were sufficiently encouraging for Moscow to give permission 
for full-scale development and production. 
  Two years later, the scientists at Obolensk were asked to 
develop an even more deadly germ based on pneumonic plague, 
another airborne infection. Pasechnik's job was to refine the 
production processes to make the operation more efficient. As a 
result, by 1987 the Soviet Union had sufficient industrial 
capacity to manufacture 200 kilos of the super-plagues every 
week, enough to kill up to 500,000 people. 
  The super-plague germ was, of course, never manufactured on 
this scale. The germ had a short life and only enough was made 
for testing. But the Biopreparat network stood on standby, 
ready to begin fullscale production when instructed, at a time 
in the future that was designated Day X. 
  Here then was a programme for producing the most devastating 
genetically engineered weapons ever seen, just waiting to be 
given the go-ahead. Tiny quantities of the Russian super-plague 
could devastate any city in the West, killing millions while 
leaving buildings, factories and raw materials intact. They 
would be the perfect designer weapon. 
  At the Soviet defence ministry, high-ranking generals were 
fully aware of this biological capability and built it into 
their military planning. Known as the Weapons of Special 
Designation, they would be used not only as a last resort but as 
support weapons in a conventional non-nuclear conflict, to 
attack the enemy's troop reserves and hamper his operations at 
ports and rail centres. 
  Every part of this programme was in breach of the 1972 
Biological and Toxin Warfare Convention, an international 
agreement which the Soviet Union had signed. It was also 
against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been 
proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev. 
  For Pasechnik, the Gorbachev era was a chance to try to 
change the direction of the programme at his laboratory. In 
late 1985 he pressured senior officials in Biopreparat to let 
him switch some of his research effort to the civilian purposes 
for which it had ostensibly been established. He got nowhere. 
  "I was told many times just to get on with my work and stay 
in my place," he said. Pasechnik did just that. By 1988, he 
had risen to a rank equivalent to that of major-general and was 
in charge of two manufacturing plants and three research 
laboratories. Two of these were working on biological weapons; 
the third was given to him to placate his desire to do civil 
work--and also as a cover for the biological warfare research. 
  But Pasechnik was increasingly uneasy. He had no idea that 
his work was in breach of the 1972 treaty; he did not know such 
a treaty existed. But he felt that the weapons he was helping 
to develop were an abuse of his scientific skills--and 
demonstrated hypocrisy in the Russian military command about the 
Gorbachev revolution. Above all, he felt passionately that 
genetically engineered biological weapons were a crime against 
humanity. 
  In late 1988, he began to think about defecting. Despite his 
long and illustrious scientific career, Pasechnik had never been 
allowed to travel outside the Soviet bloc. Then, in the summer 
of 1989, Biopreparat began negotiations with a factory in 
Toulouse, France, which manufactures equipment for chemical 
laboratories. Pasechnik volunteered to go to finalise the deal. 
As a reward for his overall performance, permission was granted. 
  He arrived in France at the beginning of October. He had 
thought carefully about how to escape the KGB watchers who 
travelled with his group. One morning he telephoned the British 
embassy in Paris and in a brief conversation with a surprised 
diplomat announced himself, his position and his wish to defect. 
  The news of his offer reached the Secret Intelligence 
Service 
(SIS, otherwise known as MI6) in London at a critical time. For 
the previous five years, SIS, the American CIA and a number of 
Nato military intelligence organisations had been trying to 
piece together the snippets of information they had about the 
Soviet biological warfare programme. 
  In May 1979, American intelligence had heard reports of an 
explosion at a secret Soviet research facility on the outskirts 
of Sverdlovsk, 850 miles east of Moscow. A leak of anthrax had 
killed up to a hundred people; an area three miles downwind of 
the factory had been contaminated. The Russians had tried to 
contain the damage with a widespread immunisation programme but 
it had proved largely useless. 
  Throughout the 1980s, the leak had been raised by both 
British and American officials with their Soviet counterparts. 
But the official line remained the same: that a handful of 
people had died in the city after eating contaminated meat 
bought on the black market. There was no biological weapons 
programme. 
  Snippets of information from sources in the Soviet Union 
suggested otherwise. Satellite pictures showed plants and 
testing sites apparently configured for the manufacture of 
biological weapons. The DIA (the Defence Intelligence Agency, 
the Pentagon's spies) estimated that the Russians had up to 
eight sites for developing and storing biological weapons. SIS 
largely concurred with that view, and a series of reports were 
circulated to intelligence chiefs and British ministers, warning 
that the Soviet biological programme had not slowed down as a 
result of the Gorbachev reforms. 
  As frequently happens when intelligence is fragmentary, the 
politicians refused to hear the message. At the time, all 
Western governments had been seduced by Gorbachev's reforms. 
The cold war was thawing and no prime minister or president was 
prepared to risk a confrontation with the Soviet Union that 
might change the delicate balance of international relations. 
At the same time, there was a sense that Gorbachev was an 
honourable man who would not allow anything as terrible as 
biological weapons to be developed while he was president. The 
intelligence warnings were ignored. 
  When the SIS station chief in Paris flashed the message to 
London about the would-be defector in Toulouse, it caused 
considerable excitement. At last, here was proof that would 
satisfy even the most sceptical politician. Pasechnik was 
driven to Paris and caught a British Airways flight to Heathrow, 
travelling on false papers supplied by British intelligence. 
  As his feet touched British soil, Pasechnik burst into 
tears. 
The decision to leave his country and his family had placed a 
terrible strain on the defector. He had convinced himself that 
the work he had been doing was so terrible that he would 
probably face serious charges and perhaps prison in the West. 
It is a measure of his courage that, despite his fears, he 
stepped off the plane ready to tell all. As soon as he was 
settled in a safe house outside London he was reassured that he 
had found a new home and not a prison cell. 
  There was the normal nervousness in SIS about any defector: 
was he a plant? All the indications were that he was bona 
fide. He did not know how to drive, a clear sign that he was a 
member of the privileged elite in the Soviet Union; the distress 
he showed when he recounted the work he was doing was impossible 
to fake; then there was his love of Mozart sonatas, which he 
would listen to in the evenings after yet another dinner with 
his guardians. The SIS debriefers were quickly reassured. 
  He brought with him a wealth of new information. "It was 
stunning," said one of the debriefers. "A whole ministry 
exposed, billions of roubles spent, a complete organisation 
shown to be a front; then there was the clear involvement of 
Gorbachev, this friend of the West. It just went on and on." 
  To cope with all the information Pasechnik produced, SIS, 
the Ministry of Defence and other government departments set up 
a special task force of scientists, intelligence officers and 
analysts to assess the intelligence and put it into a wider 
context. 
  It was painstaking work, but very fruitful. As he described 
his entire life, education and work, the taskforce understood 
for the first time the real relationship between the Academy of 
Sciences, previously considered a purely civilian body, and the 
Soviet military. 
  As is usual in such cases, the intelligence gleaned from 
Pasechnik was shared with the CIA; on both sides of the Atlantic 
the mosaic of Russia's biological weapons programme was 
gradually filled in. As the picture cleared, so both the CIA 
and SIS began to brief their respective political masters. For 
the first time, the politicians were given unambiguous reports, 
clearly prepared on the basis of information from a 
highly-placed defector. To underline the seriousness of the 
problem, Pasechnik was brought out to brief senior officials on 
both sides of the Atlantic. 
  The evidence was so compelling that even the politicians who 
had no wish to confront Gorbachev were left with no choice. In 
April 1990, the British and American Governments jointly 
confronted the Soviet Union with the evidence and spelled out in 
detail what they knew. There was no reaction. 
  Then, in June 1990, President George Bush and Margaret 
Thatcher met separately with Gorbachev. Both raised the 
question of biological weapons; Gorbachev denied all knowledge. 
Thatcher, who believed she had a specially-close relationship 
with the Soviet leader, told him that unless the programme was 
stopped, the West would go public. Gorbachev promised that he 
would look into the matter. 
  Two months later, the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard 
Shevardnadze, sent a formal reply, rebutting the charges. By 
this time, both the CIA and SIS had produced an even more 
exhaustive briefing for Bush and Thatcher. Having succeeded in 
forcing action at the highest levels after so many years of 
frustration, the intelligence community was determined to press 
its case until the Russians confessed. 
  In December 1990, the Russians issued an invitation to 
Washington and London to visit four of the sites that had been 
named. A joint Anglo-American delegation was dispatched. 
  If the trip was intended to be reassuring, it had the 
opposite effect. In Obolensk the British discovered a chamber 
for testing biological weapons suspended in an aerosol. The 
steel room which was 50ft square, had posts on the floor to 
which animals could be tied while vents in the ceiling allowed 
poisons to be sprayed into the room. 
  The team also discovered a chamber used to test delivery 
systems for biological weapons. At another site, there was row 
after row of fermenters used to mass produce hundreds of kilos 
of biological weapons--a chilling confirmation of everything 
Pasechnik had revealed. 
  Nevertheless, the Russians continued their denials. In 
September 1991, a month after the attempted coup, John Major, 
the new British prime minister, met Gorbachev in the Kremlin. 
Publicly the two-hour meeting was confined to economic issues, 
but Major confronted him with the evidence of the secret weapons 
programme. 
  Again Gorbachev denied everything and moved the normally 
unflappable Major to wave an angry finger in the face of the 
Russian leader. "We've got the goods on you," he shouted. 
  As the intelligence community continued adding to the file, 
the confrontations with Moscow continued through the fall of 
Gorbachev and the rise to power of Boris Yeltsin. On February 
1, 1992, Bush and Yeltsin met for their first summit. In 
advance of the meeting at Camp David, American diplomats made 
clear that the biological weapons programme was a major 
stumbling block between the two allies and a gesture by Yeltsin 
in this area would be seen as a sign of a new era in 
U.S.-Russian relations. This time Yeltsin came prepared. He 
admitted, for the first time, that there had indeed been a 
secret programme and that he had ordered it to be shut down. 
  But it was not for another month that Yeltsin was told by 
his 
own officials of the full extent of the programme. In March, 
the Russian military finally came clean: they had secretly 
developed bombs and missiles capable of carrying the 
super-plagues in defiance of international agreements. Yeltsin 
signed a formal decree cancelling the programme. 
  But the disinformation did not stop there, as prominent 
Russian officials involved in the Biopreparat programme set 
about trying to minimise the work they had been involved in. It 
was a campaign filled with the kind of lies and evasions that 
were supposed to have vanished in the new era of democracy in 
Russia. 
  For example, General Valentin Yevstigneyev assured the 
newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "There were not as many people 
involved as it might seem." He maintained that the work of the 
various laboratories was essentially for civilian purposes. He 
also tried to diminish the role of Pasechnik. 
  Reactions like these contributed to growing scepticism in 
both London and Washington that Yeltsin's order to dismantle the 
Biopreparat project was being carried out. Although the main 
testing site was reported to have been shut down, those 
monitoring the project were hardly reassured when it was 
announced that the man put in charge of the dismantling of 
Biopreparat would be General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the architect 
of the Soviet Union's chemical weapons programme. His 
appointment was seen as a sop to the hardliners in the military. 
  One senior Western intelligence official said: "Here was 
this man who had done nothing but lie to us for years on 
chemical weapons, and now suddenly we are supposed to accept 
that he is willingly going to set about destroying his life's 
work. We could hardly be expected to take Yeltsin's promises at 
face value." 
  In July 1992, the British and American Governments demanded 
from the Russians a list of all their biological weapons 
research, production and storage sites and access to them. Two 
months later, Russia agreed to allow a full inspection but 
failed to admit the existence of all of their sites. There the 
matter stands. Since then verification has proved almost 
impossible. 
  To reinforce Western concerns the CIA brought out a defector 
from the Biopreparat programme in late 1992. He confirmed 
Pasechnik's story, and added to Western suspicions that, while 
Yeltsin was claiming the programme had stopped, the research and 
development of new strains of genetically-engineered 
superweapons were continuing apace. When President Bill Clinton 
and Yeltsin met in Vancouver less than a year ago, biological 
warfare was on the agenda. Once again, Yeltsin assured the 
American president that all work had stopped. This time, 
Yeltsin was so convincing that even some of the most cynical in 
the intelligence community were inclined to believe him. 
  Then, last autumn, another defector from the Biopreparat 
project came over to British intelligence to tell his debriefers 
what steps the Russian military had taken to keep the project 
going. 
  In every facility that had been opened for inspection to 
Western intelligence, the Russians had established convincing 
cover stories that made it appear as if each site had been 
converted to research or manufacture of vaccines. The secret 
work continued in parts of the sites that were never visited by 
the American or British officials. At the same time, a secret 
new facility was being built at Lakhta near St. Petersburg. Far 
from the Biopreparat biological warfare programme being shut 
down, it had undergone considerable modernisation. Work is 
continuing as before, in defiance of Yeltsin's orders. 
  If the story so far has not had a happy ending for Britain 
and America, the source of the information that exposed the 
programme has been more fortunade. 
  Today, Vladimir Pasechnik is happily settled in England. He 
has a job he loves working for a British company doing exactly 
the civilian research he wanted to do when he graduated. For 
him the disappointment is that his sacrifice in leaving the 
country he still talks about with a patriotic fondness has not 
stopped the programme he still considers to be a serious threat 
to humanity. 
  If this research is allowed to continue in defiance of the 
political leadership in Moscow, it makes a mockery of Russia's 
pretensions to be a democracy. It also raises serious questions 
about the future intentions of the Russian military, who have 
used political capital and scarce resources to continue a 
programme that remains a key part of their war plans.

<F P=106> [Article signed NN/AB: "Flavio Cotti Ends Trip to North </F>
America -- Swiss Participation in the Partnership for Peace 
Encouraged"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Ottawa (Canada), 25 Mar (ATS) -- Flavio Cotti's trip 
to North America concluded on Thursday [24 March] in Ottawa 
where the federal counselor met Canadian Foreign Minister Andre 
Ouellet. The question of Swiss participation in the Partnership 
for Peace was raised as it had been in Washington on Monday. 
According to Mr. Cotti, the contacts established during the 
trip confirm that Switzerland's neutrality is a key element of 
its credibility on the international scene. 
  Following the example of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Mr. Ouellet also asked Switzerland to consider a 
possible "a la carte" participation in the Partnership for 
Peace. Mr. Cotti said that Canada is willing to enhance 
cooperation with countries that are not members of the Atlantic 
Alliance. 
  The head of the federal department of foreign affairs 
reaffirmed that Switzerland would examine the offer made by 
NATO. The federal counselor will have to make a decision on the 
principle and methods of the Partnership for Peace in the coming 
months, he said. Mr. Cotti also stressed that any cooperation 
with Switzerland should respect its neutrality status. 
<H5>  Cooperation With Russia </H5>
  Regarding international relations, the federal counselor 
highlighted the agreement between the Swiss and the Canadian 
Governments on the need to intensify cooperation between the 
West and the Russian Federation. Switzerland also has a role to 
play in the rapprochement process, even if only a modest one. 
For Flavio Cotti, the assignment of Ambassador Edouard Brunner 
as the UN mediator in Georgia is an example of this role. This 
type of cooperation can be strenghtened in the future. 
<H5>  Blue Helmets </H5>
  The UN peacekeeping operations were also mentioned during 
the 
talks. The Canadian Government, with its long-standing 
experience in this field, expressed interest in the campaign in 
Switzerland for the creation of a contingent of blue helmets. 
Mr. Cotti, for his part, acquainted himself with the experience 
of the Canadian troops. A contingent of Canadian blue helmets is 
now serving with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Turning to bilateral issues, both ministers welcomed the 
quality of their relations. Mr. Cotti said bilateral ties are 
strong and said they would be expanded in the future. In this 
respect, the head of the Canadian diplomatic corps has been 
invited to visit Switzerland at a time to be specified.

  [Text] Mannheim (DPA) -- The City of Mannheim has 
prohibited a nationwide Kurdish demonstration announced for 
Sunday [27 March]. According to a joint statement by the city 
and the police headquarters on Friday, Mayor Gerhard Widder 
imposed the prohibition in the interest of public security on 
account of the experiences with actions of Kurdish groups. 
Nevertheless, the city and the police expect Kurdish actions in 
Mannheim during the weekend. 
  According to the city, a Kurd gave notice of a demonstration 
and a mourning procession to commemorate the two Turkish women 
who set themselves on fire last Monday in order to protest 
against the situation of the Kurds in Turkey and who died of 
their injuries. The man who filed the notification had expected 
10,000 to 20,000 demonstrators.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Hamburg (DPA) -- [Passage 
omitted] The riots feared during Kurdish demonstrations and 
rallies on Saturday [26 March] have not taken place. However, 
the police have not yet sounded the all-clear. 
  In the afternoon, the traditional Newroz celebration of the 
Kurds began -- accompanied by several hundred policemen -- in 
Frankfurt/Main with much noise but peacefully. "The situation 
is characterized by unpredictability, fanaticism, and controlled 
leadership," a police spokesman said. The authorities are also 
prepared for activities in other places. The Frankfurt Newroz 
celebrations had been permitted under strict conditions. 
  On Sunday police expect thousands of Kurds to come to 
Mannheim, to follow a call for a mourning demonstration for two 
Kurdish women from Turkey. The women had burned themselves in 
Mannheim in protest against the situation of their people in 
Anatolia. Police consider it possible that more than 20,000 
Kurds will come to the rally, which was banned by the city on 
Friday. Units of the Federal Border Police (BGS) have been 
ordered to Mannheim. 
  In Hannover about 200 people, who mainly belonged to the 
autonomous scene, demonstrated on Saturday against the 
oppression of Kurds in Turkey. In Cologne the Kurds have 
obviously respected the ban on demonstrations issued by the 
Cologne police president. Apart from a small group of Kurds 
carrying banners, there were no protests. Police and BGS had 
gathered more than 3,000 of their men in the city as a 
precaution. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aachen/Kleve (DPA) -- About 300 Kurds, who came 
from the Netherlands and Belgium and were refused entry into the 
FRG on Sunday [27 March], blocked the highway border checkpoints 
in the Aachen three-country corner for hours out of protest. 
With their sitting blockade they unsuccessfully tried until 
noon to force permission to enter the country. A press 
spokesman of the Federal Border Police in Kleve stated that the 
Kurds, who had come from the neighboring countries in busses, do 
"not have any right" to enter. 
  The Kurds obviously wanted to go to Mannheim to participate 
in the mourning march for the two young women who had burned 
themselves last week out of protest against the oppression of 
their people in Turkey.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) assessed the peaceful 
demonstrations of several thousand Kurds in various German 
cities on Sunday [27 March] as an "outstanding achievement by 
the police and by society." He praised, above all, the security 
forces, who worked around the clock, but also the Kurdish 
families, who did not let themselves be instigated by agitators. 
  However, one cannot give the all-clear regarding the terror 
of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), he said in Bonn. The 
challenge continues. The minister affirmed that all proceedings 
of criminal and aliens' law against PKK members who committed 
acts of violence are to be concluded as quickly as possible. A 
deportation agreement with Turkey, which guarantees that those 
deported will not receive a death sentence, is as necessary as 
the determined enforcement of the PKK ban in Germany.

  [Text] Mannheim (DPA) -- Despite a ban on demonstrations, 
more than 10,000 Kurds came to Mannheim to hold rallies on 
Sunday [27 March]. The dispersal of many gatherings by the 
police was largely peaceful. In the evening, city and the 
police spokesmen told journalists that a total of 40 persons 
were arrested. Apart from two, whose arrests were not because 
of the demonstration, they have been released again. 
  Kurds in Germany and abroad had called for a mourning march 
for two women who had burned themselves in Mannheim last Monday 
in protest at the oppression of their people in Turkey. In the 
evening, Mayor Gerhard Widder (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany) said that the city had banned the demonstrations 
because the safety of citizens and demonstrators had not been 
guaranteed. During strict checks, which the police had 
instituted along all major roads leading into Mannheim in the 
morning, arriving Kurds had been told so. According to the 
latest experiences, a high potential of violence and new 
self-immolations had to be expected. 
  Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) stressed that it was expected that 
up to 40,000 Kurds would answer the call. Therefore, it had 
been agreed with the other laender that checks would be held and 
Kurds recognized as participants in the banned demonstration 
would be prevented from continuing on their way. This led to 
far fewer persons coming than had been feared. The Federal 
Border Police (BGS) had stopped the entry of Kurds at the 
borders, such as at the three-country corner near Aachen. 
  Police pointed out that, during the checks, more than 250 
knives, machetes, cudgels, and blank-cartridge pistols were 
seized. This shows that acts of violence would have been 
possible. The tactic of dispersing gatherings for 
demonstrations, but countering escalations led to the fact that 
no one was injured and the only material damage caused was to 
two cars. The strong presence of the approximately 2,700 
officials of the BGS and police from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, 
Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bavaria was also quite impressive. 
  The police stated that, despite the strict checks and the 
many people turned back, as of noon, Kurds -- 10,000 in the end 
-- kept entering Mannheim. Slogans were repeatedly shouted 
against the Turkish Government, but also against the German 
Government. Some people in the crowd were arrested. Batons 
were not used. 
  In the afternoon, the Kurds withdrew to the edge of the 
city, 
from where they departed in the evening, after those arrested 
had been released and a minute of silence had been observed.

has come out against the deportation of violent Kurds to Turkey 
if they are threatened with torture or the death penalty there. 
However, Kurds who commit acts of violence must be tried in 
Germany, the minister said on Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday 
morning [28 March]. Furthermore, she pointed out that Turkey 
has joined various international agreements, such as the 
anti-torture convention. This shows that Ankara has obligations 
in this respect.

Turkish facilities in Bremen has not stopped. As police 
announced on Monday [28 March], on Sunday morning one or more 
unknown persons tried to set fire to the premises of a Turkish 
friendship association in the Hanseatic city. The fire was 
extinguished in time. So far, there is no trace of the 
perpetrators. 
  Last Wednesday and Friday, a Turkish restaurant and a 
textile 
shop owned by a Turk were set on fire by unknown persons. No 
one was injured. Police estimated the total damage at about 
150,000 German marks. In both cases the shop windows had been 
broken and the furniture was set on fire.

  [Excerpt] Luebeck (DPA) -- Last night, unknown 
perpetrators carried out an arson attack on the synagogue in 
Luebeck. Since the fire was soon discovered and the 
fire-brigade was called, only minor damage was caused. The room 
where the divine services are held was not damaged. 
  Winfried Tabarelli, senior director of the Criminal 
Investigation Department for the South of Schleswig-Holstein, 
said at the scene that there had been no indications of an 
attack. It is impossible to guard every possible target of an 
attack around the clock. Nevertheless, the attack has to be 
rated as attempted murder, since six families live in the house, 
he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- "I am by no means surprised 
by this attack." On Friday [25 March], Ignatz Bubis, chairman 
of the Central Council of the Jews in Germany, reacted with 
these words to the arson attack on the synagogue in Luebeck. 
Such actions are not least due to the "mental arsonists" who 
create the climate for it with virulent campaigns and hate 
slogans, Bubis told DPA. For him, the real arsonists are 
extreme right parties, such as the Republikaner, the German 
People's Union, the National Democratic Party of Germany, and 
others of a total of 82 rightist groups and parties. 
  Bubis said that the fact that synagogues are targets of 
attacks by extreme right groups is new. In the past two years, 
Jewish graves and memorials were desecrated, but no synagogues. 
As a consequence of the incident in Luebeck, Bubis called for 
more severe social ostracism of "arsonists" and stricter 
punishment of the perpetrators. "Authorities and courts still 
have not understood that warnings and educational measures are 
not enough to deter right-wing extremists from such actions," 
the chairman of the Central Council said.

  [Text] Erding (DPA) -- One day after the arson attack on 
the synagogue in Luebeck, Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber once again accused Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the 
Central Council of Jews in Germany, of "instigating people." He 
will not deviate "one centimeter" from this accusation, 
Schoenhuber said at a news conference at the Bavarian land 
congress of the right-wing extremist Republikaner in Erding near 
Munich on Saturday [26 March]. "The one who causes 
anti-Semitism in Germany is Mr. Bubis." 
  The delegates' meeting, from which the press was excluded, 
was accompanied by protests. "Right-wing extremists are once 
again waging war against a hesitating democracy," said Fritz 
Schoesser, Bavarian land chairman of the German Trade Union 
Federation, with a view to the latest attacks. At a peaceful 
memorial rally he stated that the 70,000 registered right-wing 
extremists are a "warning signal for democracy in this country." 
According to the police, about 600 people participated in the 
demonstration against right-wing extremism.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of Werner Hoyer, 
secretary general of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], 
Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of the right-wing extremist 
Republikaner, must "be stopped." Schoenhuber's 
"unscrupulousness" in choosing his words -- who called Ignatz 
Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, an 
"instigator of people," and after the attack on the synagogue in 
Luebeck -- is "extremely alarming," Hoyer said in Bonn on Monday 
[28 March]. What Schoenhuber says is the "intellectual breeding 
ground for those who throw Molotov cocktails into synagogues and 
tacitly accept the death of people as a result." 
  Hoyer and FRG Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) called on the democratic 
forces in the FRG to categorically defend themselves against 
Schoenhuber's words and deeds. Hoyer admonished that words such 
as "instigator of people" addressed to "such an upright and 
prudent man" as Bubis must "arouse all parties before they cause 
irreparable damage." 
  "It has always been a speciality of the German rightists to 
be the perpetrators and to support murders and then present 
themselves as victims," Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, deputy chairwoman 
of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, said in an interview 
on Suedwestfunk radio in Baden-Baden. However, she hopes that 
there will be a judge in Germany who will finally put "this 
instigator" behind bars.

<F P=106> [Interwiew with Pascal Boniface, the founder and director of </F>
the International and Strategic Relations Institute (IRIS), by 
Sylvaine Pasquier; place and date not given: "Defense: Beyond 
the White Paper"] 
  [Text] L'EXPRESS broadens the discussion with Pascal 
Boniface. 
  Francois Mitterrand said: "It suits me." The white paper on 
defense, which Edouard Balladur made public on 23 February, 
seems actually to favor cohabitation rather than being 
visionary. Regarded as committing France's strategic options 
until 2010, it is careful not to resolve the issues troubling 
politicians and experts, especially in the nuclear and the 
military service sectors. As it stands, the choices to be made 
by the administration that will ensue from the 1995 presidential 
election have a good chance of being different, Pascal Boniface, 
the founder and director of the International and Strategic 
Relations Institute (IRIS), stresses. He teaches at the School 
of Political Science and heads the third cycle of strategic 
studies at the Paris-Nord University. He is the author of some 
15 books, among them, The Army: A Survey of 300,000 
Unappreciated Soldiers, Long Live the Bomb (Edition No. 1), 
and The International Relations Atlas (Dunod). He is 
responsible for the publication of The Strategic Year 
(Dunod). The world in the face of new threats and the defense 
policy are discussed in this interview. 
  [Pasquier] We expected from the white paper on defense, the 
first since 1972, a redefinition of France's strategic options. 
But should we be surprised that the cohabitation has neutralized 
most of the debates? 
  [Boniface] Such an era does not lend itself well to radical 
changes in the defense establishment. Already, at the time of 
the previous cohabitation, between 1986 and 1988, in matters 
such as the Strategic Defense Initiative or the role of tactical 
nuclear arms, the views of the president of the republic 
prevailed each time the government tried to change the system, 
which is normal since he is the head of the Armed Forces. Today 
as then, the prime minister--who, by nature, favors cohabitation 
and is eyeing the presidency--is in the worst position to 
undermine presidential supremacy. 
  [Pasquier] In that case, was it crucial to wait? 
  [Boniface] In fact, nothing, no political nor legal rule, 
required that the white paper express a consensus, since it is 
the product of the government itself. So we have an 
intellectually acceptable document, but one that will not be 
memorable until 2010, despite its expressed ambitions, for it's 
a safe bet that the administration that emerges from the next 
presidential election will face very different choices. For the 
time being, they remain hidden. 
  [Pasquier] Do you that the analysis of post-cold war 
international landscape will remain relevant within the time 
frame covered by the white paper? 
  [Boniface] On that subject, the white paper has succeeded in 
its mission, which was to take into consideration the 
disappearance of the former Soviet enemy and the diversity of 
the new threats. The appearance of regional conflicts, such as 
the one caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia, as well as 
terrorism, drug traffic, and financial flows; all these issues 
will remain topical beyond 1995. Undoubtedly what will take 
longer to become outdated will be an organized system of crisis 
scenarios or possible risks. Be that as it may, in the matter of 
defense, plans are made 20 or 25 years ahead, whereas it is 
difficult to foresee international developments beyond five or 
at the most 10 years. 
  [Pasquier] What is the best suitable response to the new 
conflicts? 
  [Boniface] Conventional means, undoubtedly, and the white 
paper recognizes this. As part of peacekeeping operations and in 
order to restore stability, there will actually be a greater 
need for this type of force, capable of being deployed rapidly 
and far. This means that the portion of the budget relating to 
conventional forces must increase. However, the nuclear sector 
remains the ultimate defense guarantee with regard to French 
territory and its vital interests. In my opinion, it is rightly 
so. France's objective interest is to be a nuclear country. 
  [Pasquier] For what reason? 
  [Boniface] It has a sanctuary to preserve, unlike the United 
States. It is the only superpower in the world now, and no state 
would risk attacking its territory. The conventional arsenal at 
its disposal protects it from any serious threat. As far as that 
goes, it believes that the nuclear sector could become a 
handicap instead of remaining a trump card. It would hinder, for 
example, its possible desire to intervene in Iraq or North 
Korea. Furthermore, it is not out of the question that, someday, 
the United States might demand total nuclear disarmament. As for 
France, it is much more vulnerable. It must own the means to 
discourage any adversary from attacking it. Deterrence is 
therefore extended without changes. 
  [Pasquier] It may surprise us that the white paper does not 
settle the debate over the nuclear units. Should two of them be 
favored, the submarine and airborne forces, and the Albion 
plateau base shut down, as advocated by some? 
  [Boniface] The parties facing one another at least agree on 
the submarine unit. Discreet, efficient, and indestructible, it 
is truly the "pinnacle of deterrence." The M-5 missile program, 
launched in 1992, will equip the nuclear submarines of the new 
generation around 2005. The problem is that the development of a 
land version intended for the Albion plateau base will then be 
considered, with the president of the republic very much in 
favor of the project. Opponents of the project call the M-5 an 
error in all aspects, including budgetary, and they are 
demanding the modernization of the airborne unit, that is to say 
the long range air-to-surface missile (ASLP) that France must 
now assume on its own since Great Britain withdrew. The goal of 
some of the supporters of this option is the development of 
weapons with either a miniature load or one with modular 
capability, allowing more precise fire and a greater 
flexibility. 
  [Pasquier] Using what argument? 
  [Boniface] They see an outdated deterrence by the weak of 
the 
strong remaining powerless in the face of eventual opponents 
having at their disposal unsophisticated and limited arsenals. 
The ASLP missile as such is not synonymous with a surgical 
strike. It all depends on the nuclear head with which it is 
fitted. Let us specify, moreover, that some day the 
plane-missile combination could be deployed in our allies' 
airports. It is therefore the foremost European weapon. But the 
danger, to be avoided at all costs, would be to give in to the 
temptation of opening a Pandora's box, that is to say, to use 
these nuclear weapons as conventional ones. It is true that the 
white paper expresses no opinion on the subject. It reasserts 
the two requirements of deterrence: On the one hand, a strategic 
strike which causes damages beyond repair; on the other, an 
"ultimate warning" strike to force the opponent to stop. It is 
obvious that both the president of the republic and the prime 
minister oppose this doctrinal shift which would lead to the 
lowering of the nuclear threshold and therefore to the risk of 
escalation. France undoubtedly needs arms of extreme precision, 
but conventional. 
  [Pasquier] Is this "flexible" nuclear alternative a recent 
development? 
  [Boniface] Are you kidding! It is as old as the atomic 
weapons themselves. At the beginning, the military imagined it 
as a device more powerful than the others, causing more decisive 
damage, at less cost, and requiring fewer air raids and smaller 
payloads. Two concepts have always existed in oppostion to one 
another: one political, the need to prevent war; the other, 
operational, the need to win it. Deterrence "by the strong of 
the insane" is only the last misleading version of an old 
scarecrow. 
  [Pasquier] How are the two camps divided, between the Right 
and the Left? 
  [Boniface] There are not, on the one side, Socialists who 
would put on the old boots of Gaullism and, on the other, 
Gaullists who would no longer have hang-ups with regard to the 
use of nuclear weapons. It is all the politicians, as well as 
the experts, who are divided. It would be dangerous to consent 
to such a drift, for it would surely prevent us from building a 
European deterrence--a prospect opened by the white paper. 
  [Pasquier] Why? 
  [Boniface] This nuclear doctrine is related to the 
Schlesinger doctrine of selective reprisals, adopted by the 
United States in 1979. As it is, our nonnuclear European 
partners have rejected it vigorously. They are not now going to 
adopt a French version offering the same type of reasoning, 
whereby they accept nuclear deterrence and would be ready, some 
day, to follow us on this path. 
  [Pasquier] But first the members of the European Union 
should 
"define common interests..." 
  [Boniface] Right. It is a way of saying that such is not yet 
the case. This preliminary view can therefore pass for an 
official negative acknowledgement or, at least, a waiting 
position. But the white paper stresses that, in the future, 
deterrence will have to be considered in a European context, 
which assumes negotiations. Only one organization lends itself 
to it, the West European Union (WEU), and not NATO, which 
includes non-European members. As it stands, there are currently 
bilateral talks on this subject between the two nuclear 
countries, France and Great Britain, as well as Franco-German 
consultations. But we are still far from a real multilateral 
discussion--which is a must, for a true European deterrence does 
not mean the extension of the French and British guarantee to 
the other European countries, but a joint nuclear program 
formulated by the partners as a whole. 
  [Pasquier] Are we on the way to an indefinite ban on nuclear 
testing? 
  [Boniface] Via the white paper, France is even considering 
the formulation of a treaty for an all-out test ban, on the 
condition that it be universal and verifiable. Duly noted. 
  [Pasquier] You must admit that, straight away, the 
"universal" feature curtails ambition. 
  [Boniface] To be sure, this softer stand provides an out. 
But 
some proliferating countries would undoubtedly accept to sign 
such a treaty, for they have little need for tests in order to 
develop an unsophisticated bomb. This would not hinder the 
pursuit of their nuclear program. Moreover, let us not forget 
that the nonproliferation treaty is to be renewed in 1995: If 
the nuclear countries were to give no guarantees, the countries 
without bombs would feel cheated. As it stands, they are very 
attached to the test ban. The link with nonproliferation is not 
technical, but indeed political. If France values its 
deterrence, giving up secondary features in order to protect 
essential ones is a better plan. 
  [Pasquier] The moratorium had already unleashed bitter 
controversies on the Right. What then? 
  [Boniface] I noticed that the president of the republic and 
the prime minister have a common position on the 
issue--different from that of Jacques Chirac. Roger Baleras, the 
director of military applications of the Atomic Energy 
Commission, believes that it would take another eight to 20 
tests before France can dispense with them, figures picked up by 
the majority as a whole. The battle will be fought over this 
issue, perhaps before the presidential election. 
  [Pasquier] Are the unavoidable budget restrictions already 
burdening strategic requirements? 
  [Boniface] Everywhere, equipment orders are being revised 
downward, which does little to remedy the crisis in the arms 
industries. Let us be clear: If we want to have a European 
defense in the future, we must maintain proficiency at all 
costs. It is very difficult to gather highly skilled 
technological teams. When we let them go, there is no certainty 
that they can be regrouped at a future date. Military expenses 
on the other side of the Atlantic amounted to 7 percent of the 
GNP in 1985; they will soon go to 4.5 percent. However, the 
relative share of development expenses hardly dropped. In order 
to protect skills, there even are cases when a weapon will be 
developed in small quantities or not at all, a less expensive 
approach than persisting in manufacturing expensive and already 
obsolete weapons. 
  [Pasquier] Are you referring to the Leclerc tank? 
  [Boniface] You are the one mentioning it. When a country 
becomes dependent on foreign suppliers, everything goes well as 
long as relations are good. But when we are refused access to 
some technologies, or when the bill becomes too high, on that 
day, we find ourselves stripped of everything. 
  [Pasquier] Does France still the means to produce its 
equipment? 
  [Boniface] Obviously, the Leclerc and the Rafale are 
respectively the last French tank and combat plane. The conquest 
of foreign markets will, alone, make it possible to bear the 
financial cost of these programs. The successor of the Rafale 
will have to be a European plane, given the lack of 
alternatives. The manufacturers have understood the situation so 
well that they have forged ahead of the politicians by setting 
up a system of cooperation, already European, paper, it 
specifies that, at the European level, there must be no 
industrial stalement with regard to major programs. 
  [Pasquier] Are we as concerned about Europe when it comes to 
the military service? 
  [Boniface] In fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can 
predict that n fact, without much risk of being wrong, we can 
predict that the next French exception will be that of the 
draft. Our partners, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, are 
either canceling it or, like Spain and Italy, challenging it or, 
sometimes, even ignoring it, as is the case in Great Britain. If 
France remains the only one to maintain the principle, it could 
pose a problem in the context of an integrated defense policy. 
Supporters and opponents of military service can be found in in 
all the parties but the PCF [French Communist Party]. Be that as 
it may, the white paper, on a very specific point, has stopped 
defending tradition: It is concerned with finally giving the 
military its say. 
  [Pasquier] But the French generals in Bosnia did not nor are 
they remaining silent. 
  [Boniface] Because within the United Nations, it is possible 
to escape from one's national hierarchy. But in France, without 
exceptions, all of those who tried to speak were sanctioned. We 
still observe MacMahon's rule: "I remove from the promotion list 
any officer whose name I have read on the cover of a book." When 
it comes to the military, a kind of speaking deterrence is 
practiced. We often regret that soldiers are not sufficiently 
interested in strategic problems. But they do not even have the 
right to discuss them! The paradox is that, in this country 
anybody can express his opinion on defense issues, except the 
military. The time may have come for the political officials to 
remedy the democratic deficit prevailing in the barracks. Let 
them recognize the soldier's civil rights, and not only his 
right to vote. Let also stop the practice of transferring 
officers to a different town every three years. The British 
army, which is not, I believe, the worst in the world, has no 
need for this constant moving in order to function. 
  [Pasquier] The conflict in Bosnia has brought France nearer 
to the Atlantic alliance. But does the future of European 
security pass by the United Nations or the WEU? 
  [Boniface] France can no longer be suspected, as in the 
past, 
of wanting to destroy the alliance. On the contrary, it 
participates fully in the peace keeping missions, as can be 
noted in the former Yugoslavia. NATO, in its reasoning and its 
structures, has currently, and in the near future, a vital role 
in the European security. For all that, the future must not be 
abused--meaning the WEU which will assert its influence in the 
medium and long term. If France were to fully rejoin the 
Atlantic alliance--many are thinking about it, even if few are 
expressing it--it would bolster the desire of some Central 
European countries, for example, to join NATO rather than the 
WEU. As it stands, tomorrow, their security could be subjected 
to the good will of a reticent U.S. Administration. 
  [Pasquier] Does Russia appears to you as a factor of 
instability in Europe? 
  [Boniface] There is in fact a Russian problem, and the 
United 
States is largely responsible for it. It went from one extreme 
to the other. Shortly after the Gulf War, it viewed Russia as a 
blank spot on the map. It is now doing everything to support it. 
But if Russia no longer has the power to act, it still has the 
power to harm. For all that, not to the extent of seriously 
worrying Poland or Hungary, at least I do not think so, despite 
the clamors of a Zhirinovskiy. The same is not true of the 
so-called near abroad border countries. Over the past year, 
Moscow has interfered in Tajikistan, pressured Ukraine and 
Belarus, brought Georgia back into the Russian fold, and relied 
on the Armenians and the Azeris. The Westerners are disclaiming 
any responsibility about this and Russia, in the name of a 
backhand Monroe Doctrine of sort, is asserting its prerogatives 
in this area. It is in the process of rebuilding a strategic 
Soviet Union. Meanwhile, in some regions, above all in Crimea, 
where citizens of Russian origin are the majority, the 
possibility of seeing a Yugoslav scenario duplicated by Russia 
and Ukraine is not to be ruled out. 
  [Pasquier] Does Western helplessness toward the conflict in 
the former Yugoslavia indicate a difficulty in grasping this 
type of threat? 
  [Boniface] It is both simpler and more alarming: The 
politicians realized that utopia was out of place in domestic 
policy; and that there was no instant remedy to unemployment and 
the economic crisis. They then transferred utopia to the 
international theater. Miracle solutions flourished on the soil 
of foreign conflicts. An operation is launched in Somalia and we 
make believe that developing problems in Africa will be solved 
because of it. We demand air strikes against Serbian positions 
around Sarajevo and we make believe that the different 
communities of the former Yugoslavia will resume a harmonious 
cohabitation. Contrary to the analysis whereby leaders govern by 
overbanking on a televisual emotion, essentially short-lived, we 
are reduced to jumping out of the frying pan into the fire!

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Somalia/Italy: Foreign Ministry on </F>
Reconciliation Accord"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March 24 -- The Italian foreign 
ministry on Thursday [24 March] expressed "appreciation" for the 
ceasefire and national reconciliation accord signed in Nairobi 
today by Somalia's two most powerful warlords, Mohamed Farah 
Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
  In a communique, the ministry praised the mediating efforts 
of the special United Nations envoy and of neighboring countries 
and expressed the hope that the Nairobi accords "will facilitate 
the rapid re-establishment of conditions of greater trust and 
agreement" and "institutional solutions" that may keep Somalia 
united. 
  Italy will remain present in Somalia through its diplomatic 
seat and its development aid efforts and will take part in the 
country's reconstruction process, "as soon as conditions allow," 
said the ministry. 
  The agreement calls for "voluntary disarmament" and a 
national reconciliation conference in May to elect a president. 
It also repudiates all forms of violence as a means of 
resolving conflicts and calls for a meeting of Somali factions 
in Mogadishu on April 15 to set up rules and procedures for 
voting and criteria for participation in the reconciliation 
conference. 
  The reconciliation conference will allegedly elect a 
president, vice president and prime minister for Somalia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Replies to Berlusconi on </F>
False Budget Charges"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 24 -- Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi on Thursday [24 March] broke his self-imposed 
silence for the March 27 election campaign and issued a stern 
reply to [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, the media 
magnate-turned-politician who last night accused the government 
of falsifying the state accounts. 
  "No one can honestly talk about falsifications," Ciampi said 
in a statement, referring to Berlusconi's allegations in a 
televised debate with Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic 
Party of the Left, that Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa had 
doctored the deficit figures. 
  Spaventa and Berlusconi will be facing off in Rome's 
downtown 
first-past-the-post constituency for a seat in the Senate. 
  "Last night the government was accused by a political 
candidate of having presented false budget figures, in contempt 
of parliament," Ciampi's statement said, adding: "In the face of 
this very grave affirmation I am forced to break the silence I 
had imposed on myself during this election campaign." 
  Ciampi also cited his decision not to take part in the 
campaign's closing forum, broadcast on public television Friday 
night and traditionally attended by the government chief. 
  In his statement, Ciampi reiterated that the cabinet's 
budget 
figures were compiled by the three finance ministers together, 
were approved by parliament and were in line with forecasts and 
calculations made by major international institutions. Upward 
revisions of the forecast 1994 deficit made earlier this week, 
he said, were in line with lower projected growth figures made 
by the same international organizations (European Union, OECD, 
IMF). 
  That part of the higher forecast deficit (14 trillion lire 
above the December forecasts) not caused by external economic 
factors amounts to some five trillion lire (3.1 billion 
dollars), Ciampi continued, but since revisions of this size, 
"considering payments of 700 trillion lire and revenues of 540 
trillion lire, happen in all countries, and no one can honestly 
talk about falsifications." 
  Ciampi then defended his government's economic policies, 
citing the renewed trust of foreign investors, successful 
privatizations and substantial interest rate cuts, which have 
reduced interests on debt servicing.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to information obtained by 
Alliance 90/Greens, the Turkish Army has bombed the Kurdish 
village of Bezuke near Cizre in southeastern Turkey. In the 
process, 14 people were killed, as Angelika Beer, a member of 
the party's Executive Committee, reported on Sunday [27 March] 
from Diyarbakir. A press release further says that the Turkish 
Government has done everything over the past few days to prevent 
foreign observers from watching the local elections in Kurdistan. 
  The Greens called on the Federal Government to make it 
unambiguously clear to Ankara that any further cooperation is 
linked with observing human rights in Turkey. This, for its 
part, can currently mean only that all military and economic 
support must be ceased immediately.

  [Text] Mainz (DPA) -- On Sunday [27 March] the Turkish 
police lifted the blockade against the German election monitors 
in Turkey after more than 30 hours. DPA was told this by 
Bernd-Olaf Hagedorn, Greens spokesman in the Mainz Landtag, on 
Sunday. About 50 members of several human rights organizations 
had been detained in their hotel in the Kurdish town of Batman 
since Friday. The people in question are well; following an 
intervention by the German Embassy, they are also permitted to 
use the telephone again. However, they refuse to leave the hotel. 
  A spokesman of the Bonn Foreign Ministry said: "We made very 
clear statements to the Foreign Ministry and to the Interior 
Ministry in Ankara." In addition, an embassy employee talked to 
the authorities in Batman. The spokesman said that the blockade 
was due to the nervousness of the authorities in connection with 
the elections. Security checks are so strict that it is hardly 
possible to move about freely. 
  The human rights delegations have been in the Kurdish area 
since 19 March to observe the local elections on Sunday. On 
Monday they wanted to return to Germany. They are accompanied 
by six participants from Mainz and Wiesbaden, including Friedel 
Gruetzmacher, head of the Greens group in the 
Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today put a brave 
face on what Labour described as "capitulation" by Britain in 
the bitter battle over voting rights in the enlarged European 
Union. 
  And Conservative back-bench dissidents claim that Britain 
has 
climbed down from her previous insistence that 23 votes should 
be enough to block unwanted Brussels legislation -- even after 
the enlargement of the Community to 16 in the New Year. 
  Now, they fear, their opponents have won the day, naming 27 
votes as the blocking figure, with any concessions to Britain 
still to be decided -- and still very vague. 
  But Mr Hurd insisted there was no question of his 
resignation, declaring: "I have been operating under a very 
flexible mandate given me by the Cabinet. I have no problems 
about that. I have had full support from the Prime Minister and 
my colleagues." 
  The matter will go to the Cabinet on Tuesday [29 March]. "I 
have agreed to nothing," he told the BBC Radio 4 "The World This 
Weekend" programme after the foreign ministers' meeting broke up 
at Ioannina, in northern Greece. 
  But he claimed that other countries had made a "serious 
move" 
in Britain's direction. 
  And on enlargement of the EU he conceded that the four 
incoming countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria -- 
were becoming "very anxious and distressed as the time passes 
and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that 
British objective were denied." Mr Hurd: "What has happened is 
that there has been serious work. Our position and our worries 
and those of the Spaniards are more fully understood. People 
have moved towards us. 
  ``We have said we are willing to consider a satisfactory 
compromise. We are not there yet. What has happened is that 
the Greeks, in the chair, put forward a paper which no one has 
agreed to yet, but they have asked for comments by Tuesday night. 
  ``I, and indeed all the other ministers here, have to go 
back 
and discuss that with our colleagues at home. But I have agreed 
to nothing.'' 
  Mr Hurd said that everybody accepted that this was going to 
be sorted out and gone into in depth at the 1996 conference. 
"The whole relationship between the size of countries and their 
votes cannot be brushed under the carpet." 
  When it was put to him that any concessions towards Britain 
were very vague, Mr Hurd replied: "We have to decide how our 
interests and those of the minority can be protected." 
  He said the problem would not be solved by delay. "It is 
solved by how you protect that position. And that is what 
everybody now has to reflect on." 
  Mr Hurd said that some people in the majority were worried 
that the presidency paper went too far in Britain's direction. 
  "We have to consider ourselves very soberly whether it goes 
far enough, whether there are comments we want to make." 
  He went on: "We shall have to make a judgment whether what 
is 
proposed adequately protects our interests. We will have to 
judge the position of those whose entry into the European 
Community we have worked for for many years. 
  ``They are becoming very anxious and distresed as time 
passes 
and there is no agreement. It would be a great own goal if that 
British objective were denied.'' 
  The Foreign Secretary: "I have been dealing with this for 
weeks and trying to get a deal which is acceptable in our terms 
and also allows other British objectives for enlargement to be 
realised. 
  ``I don't know if I have got that. There has been serious 
work and a serious movement in our direction. We will have to 
decide whether this can be wrapped up by Easter or not.'' 
  And asked whether he had considered resignation, Mr Hurd 
replied: "One only needs to consider resignation if you are fed 
up with the job, or if your colleagues or your party or country 
as a whole goes off in a direction one feels oneself is 
unacceptable. I am not in that position at all. 
  ``I have been operating under a very flexible mandate given 
me by the Cabinet two weeks ago. I have no problems about that. 
I have had the full support from the Prime Minister and my 
colleagues.'' 
  Later, David Blunkett, chairman of the Labour Party, told 
the 
Press Association: "Petulance followed by capitulation has 
severely damaged Britain's standing and our bargaining position 
for the future. 
  ``This sorry episode has done nothing to help Britain in 
Europe and will in the end have severely damaged the Tory 
Party.''

  [Text] British residents in Algeria are being advised to 
leave the country because of the deteriorating security 
situation, the Foreign Office said. The warning comes after the 
latest killings by Islamic militants. There are an estimated 
200 Britons resident in Algeria, including many working in the 
oil industry. 
  The death toll in Algeria has mounted since elections were 
cancelled two years ago after the Islamic Salvation Front had 
seemed set to sweep to power. 
  Threats to foreigners, whom Islamic militants hold 
responsible for supporting the government, have multiplied and 
more than a dozen journalists, including a French TV cameraman, 
have been killed in recent months. 
  The Foreign Office has been advising people against going to 
Algeria for some months. 
  The new warning comes after the murder on Tuesday night [22 
March] of two Frenchmen working in the offices of a weekly 
newspaper in Algiers. Gunmen burst into the offices of HEBDO 
LIBERE, killing two employees and wounding three. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said this was seen as a 
significant escalation of the threat to all foreigners in the 
country. All British residents were "strongly advised" to leave 
Algeria unless they had compelling reasons to remain, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis in Ioannina--live] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The EU [European Union] foreign 
ministers meeting here in Ioannina is expected to give 
particular emphasis to the thorny issue of the EU's enlargement. 
Correspondent Dhimitrios Petikhakis has more details on this 
issue. 
  [Petikhakis] We have just learned that Spain appears to have 
backed down, and it is not ruled out that the British will do 
the same. Let us see what the Spanish have backed down from. 
They have not backed down from the issue of the EU's 
enlargement exactly, but from the issue of how many countries 
are needed to change the direction of the European Union. 
Currently, two large countries and one small one are needed to 
do that. After enlargement, it is only logical that this number 
will increase since the number of member countries will also 
increase. The British and Spanish were saying no. As a result, 
the institutional future of the European Union, in a way, will 
be determined here in Ioannina, and this is very, very serious. 
That is because one and one-half years ago, an institutional 
accord had been agreed on, and now a new one will be formed. 
This accord will enlarge the 12-member European Union to 16 
members, and will amend the Maastricht goals in 1996. 
Therefore, we see that something very serious is at stake here 
in Ioannina. It can not be ruled out that this meeting here in 
Ioannina will take its place in history next to the meeting that 
took place in 1991 at a very small town in southern Holland 
[Maastricht]. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The foreign ministers of the European Union, 
meeting this weekend in the Greek town of Ioannina, fail to 
agree on the question essential for the implementation of the 
enlargement to 16 members: the issue concerning the minimum 
votes required to block Community decisions. Even so prospects 
are not bad, as is made clear in the report from Nacho 
Hernandez, who has been attending the meeting for Radio Exterior 
de Espana. 
  [Hernandez] This meeting in Ioannina closes with the 
rudiments of a compromise on the institutional reform of the 
European Union. Any formula will have to be first approved by 
the governments of the member countries. If that happens the 
agreement will come next Wednesday [30 March]. It would be a 
political declaration giving every guarantee that negotiations 
on a question will continue, that all necessary efforts will be 
made, for a reasonable period of time in a case where three 
countries representing a total of 23 votes are opposed. This is 
the formula which, as Foreign Minister Javier Solana recalled, 
our country has defended: 
  [Begin Solana recording] I see some reactions from some of 
the people who have spoken that are very negative toward our 
position and toward the potential text, and I believe it shows 
the effort we are making. I believe it is a symptom that the 
text is in the right direction for us [as heard]. [end 
recording] 
  [Hernandez] Spain believes the final agreement will come 
about next Wednesday. We ended this meeting, Minister Solana 
said, in the spirit of finding a formula that will enable us to 
get along together. The difficulties, he added, may now come 
from countries which have maintained an unflexible stance -- 
that would be Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The main issue at the EU 
[European Union] Council of Ministers' unofficial meeting in 
Ioannina was the EU's enlargement and efforts to avert a 
stalemate in the process. Correspondent Dhimitrios Petikhakis 
has more details on the prospects following the talks here in 
Ioannina. 
  [Begin Petikhakis recording] On the surface, the 
disagreement 
is over how many minority votes are necessary to change the 
decisions of the majority. This issue can be clarified with the 
new treaty on the enlargement that will be signed by the 12 EU 
members, their national parliaments, and the European 
Parliament. The issue was discussed seriously for the first 
time here in Ioannina. We are not the ones to say this, rather 
it was said by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. EU 
Commission President Jacques Delors said that a compromise 
formula was found, thanks to the presidency, that is acceptable 
to all here. However, will it be acceptable to the British 
cabinet and Prime Minister John Major? If not, the EU's 
enlargement will be postponed. If yes, the enlargement will 
take place normally on 1 January 1995. Anyway, the positions of 
both Mr. Major and Mr. Hurd are at stake. We will know by 
Tuesday [29 March] or Wednesday at the latest. The agreement 
reached in Ioannina is to be signed by Wednesday morning. 
  Further beneath the surface is whether the minimum number of 
votes needed to block a decision will be 23 or 27. Almost at 
the bottom is the issue of how the European Union will operate 
in the next three years. During this time, all issues will be 
at stake, including common currency, economic policy, and 
legislation on competition. In other words, what is at stake is 
national economic interests. At that time, the 23 or 25 or 27 
votes will be worth a few billion ECU. [end recording] [passage

<F P=106> [By Christian Spillmann] </F>
  [Text] Ioannina, Greece, March 27 (AFP) -- European Union 
[EU] foreign ministers reached a compromise in a voting-rights 
row Sunday [27 March] but the proposal left both sides unhappy 
and EU expansion plans still in doubt. 
  Britain appeared to back down from its hardline stance in 
the 
row about voting rights in an enlarged European Union, conceding 
the principle that a larger number of votes would be needed to 
block measures. 
  But critics said the proposed compromise, worked out during 
an informal weekend meeting, was a "time bomb" which opened the 
door to future delaying tactics by dissident minorities within 
the EU. 
  London and Madrid had objected to changes in the minimum 
number of votes needed to block measures if the Union is 
enlarged. Currently, countries with 23 out of 76 votes can veto 
decisions. The other 10 EU members want the entry of four 
would-be newcomers to raise the blocking minority to 27 out of 
90. 
  Influential rebels in Britain's ruling Conservative Party 
have opposed any compromise, insisting that the 23-vote 
threshold be retained so that Britain's veto powers are not 
diluted. 
  According to the compromise studied by ministers at the 
weekend, the ratified membership treaties of the four new states 
would stipulate a 27-vote threshold but a parallel political 
declaration by the Council of Ministers would allow a 
conciliation process if the vote falls between 23 and 26. 
  The problem is that the new formula does not specify a 
cut-off period for the conciliation process, although French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggested three months. 
  The president of the EU's Executive Commission, Jacques 
Delors, has expressed reservations about the compromise proposal 
and was submitting it for discussion by the Commission at its 
next meeting on Tuesday, an EU source said. 
  Greece, current head of the EU's revolving presidency, has 
submitted details of the proposal to its 12 member states who 
were expected to respond by Tuesday. 
  Unless settled by the end of next month, the voting row 
threatens to delay EU membership for Austria, Finland, Norway 
and Sweden which are scheduled to join at the start of next year. 
  Any compromise would be valid only until a major overhaul of 
the EU's institutions planned for 1996. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, fighting to stem 
rebellion in the Conservative Party ahead of local and European 
elections, told BBC radio on Sunday that Britain was winning 
ground in the debate and its concerns were now "more fully 
understood." 
  "People have moved towards us and we have said that we are 
willing to consider a satisfactory compromise, but we're not 
there yet," he added. 
  His Spanish counterpart Javier Solana felt "significant 
advances" were made at Ioannina on what he called a "balanced" 
formula. 
  But Hurd said Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are 
worried about the new proposal, because they think it goes too 
far in Britain and Spain's favour. 
  This was backed up by Dutch Foreign Minister Peter 
Kooijmans, 
who described the new formula as "a real time bomb." 
  Juppe said the absence of a cut-off point could allow de 
facto blocking at 23 votes, which he described Saturday as 
"unacceptable." 
  His Belgian counterpart Willy Claes agreed, saying Sunday it 
would have been "wiser" to establish a two- to three-month 
period, but he did not see the formula as a British victory. 
  "It is not a victory for the British because the principle 
of 
a 27-vote blocking minority has been granted, and they have no 
guarantees on the length of the conciliation period," he 
commented.

  [Text] The Yugoslav problem, the issue of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], and the crucial 
organizational problem of the number of minority votes needed 
for a veto after expansion are the basic topics at the informal 
meeting of the European Union [EU] foreign ministers that opened 
yesterday and continues today in Ioannina under the chairmanship 
of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Our special 
correspondent Pavlos Tsoundos has the following report. 
  [Begin Tsoundos recording] The foreign minister agreed on 
the need to strengthen the EU role in the Bosnian crisis and 
decided to undertake an initiative for an overall solution to 
the problem. The 12 agreed that (Hans Koschnick), former mayor 
of the German town of Bremen, would undertake the administration 
of Mostar, where fierce fighting took place between Croats and 
Muslims for control of the town. The 12 also decided to work 
for the return of the Serbs to the peace process. 
  In its reports, the Greek presidency welcomed U.S. 
participation in the peace process and described as a positive 
step the recent agreement for the establishment of a 
Croatian-Muslim federation. However, the territorial arrangement 
between Croats and Muslims on the one hand and Serbs on the 
other hand remains a thorny problem. 
  On the issue of FYROM, Karolos Papoulias, who presides over 
the Council of Foreign Ministers, briefed his EU partners on the 
Greek countermeasures against FYROM and they had an initial 
exchange of views. It is expected that the discussion will 
continue. 
  A preliminary discussion was held on the critical 
organizational problem created by the projected EU expansion as 
of 1 January 1995. The talks are expected to intensify through 
contacts of the troika-- Greece, Germany, Belgium--with the 
British and Spanish sides. According to British sources, London 
remained firm in its position favoring an increase in the number 
of votes needed for a veto from 23 to 27 in the Council of 
Ministers after Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria join the EU 
on 1 January 1995. According to reports, Spain, which was 
initially aligned with the British position, accepted the 
increase in the number of veto minority votes provided that it 
would be in force after 1996 when the intergovernmental session 
is held to revise the EU institutions. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe noted that some progress 
was made in the FYROM issue but did not commit himself to the 
possibility of a final solution to the problem. [end recording]

  [Text] Intensive consultations are being held and movement 
toward resolving the The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] issue is being made at the ongoing informal meeting of 
the European Union [EU] foreign ministers in Ioannina. Late last 
night, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that progress 
was made on the FYROM issue. Today it was learned that EU 
Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek will visit Athens tomorrow for 
talks with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias. Our Ioannina special correspondent 
Pavlos Tsoundos sent the following report a short time ago. 
  [Begin Tsoundos recording] There was intensive movement 
toward solution of the FYROM problem during the deliberations at 
the informal EU foreign ministers meeting, which is continuing 
and will conclude later today in Ioannina. 
  A short time ago, it was learned that Hans Van Den Broek, EU 
commissioner in charge of foreign policy, will discuss the issue 
in Athens tomorrow with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  At yesterday's meeting of the EU foreign ministers, the 
Greek 
presidency briefed its partners on the Greek countermeasures 
against FYROM and stressed the justified political character of 
the countermeasures. Mr. Papoulias stressed that the 
countermeasures are in agreement with EU law and are provided 
for by Article 224 of the EU Treaty. The exchange of views that 
followed were held in a friendly atmosphere and emphasis was 
given to role of the United Nations and mediator Cyrus Vance for 
a solution to the FYROM problem. In a statement late last 
night, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that some 
progress was made but did not commit himself to the possibility 
of a final solution in the current period. [end recording]

  [Text] Our correspondent in Ioannina Pavlos Tsoundos 
reported that the EU [European Union] foreign ministers and 
their counterparts from the four countries that will join the 
Union continued deliberations during a working luncheon after 
the conclusion of the unofficial Council of Ministers meeting. 
During a news conference by the EU presidency, it was noted 
that talks on solutions to the The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM] issue and EU enlargement entered their final 
stages. 
  On the issue of FYROM, the initiative is now with the EU 
Council of Foreign Ministers. Even though Greece's partners in 
the European Union did not back down from their objections to 
the countermeasures against FYROM, they did not accept a 
proposal to send Greece before the European Court and now appear 
to realize the reasons that forced Athens' move. Tomorrow, EU 
Commissioner on Foreign Affairs Hans Van Den Broek will be in 
Athens and hold talks with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Van Den Broek said that he 
will not bring any message from the government of [FYROM 
President] Kiro Gligorov, but he will raise the points discussed 
during the unofficial Council of Ministers' meeting. 
  According to some information, a proposal by the foreign 
minister of Luxembourg on the issue of FYROM was tabled 
following Van Den Broek's report on the issue. This proposal 
provided for EU guarantees that FYROM would proceed with 
changing symbols and giving a binding interpretation of the 
disputed articles of its Constitution to exclude offensive 
designs against Greece; in return, Athens would lift the 
countermeasures. EU Commission President Jacques Delors made it 
clear that the issue is not under the authority of the EU 
Commission but under the EU Council of Ministers, after Greece 
recalled Article 224 of the Maastricht Treaty, which regards 
issues of foreign security. Delors said that if the issue had 
been placed on a legal basis, the EU Commission would have sent 
the case to the European Court. However, this can not be done 
under these circumstances, as the authority has now been placed 
with the political branches of the European Union. Foreign 
Minister Papoulias said that Greece's partners had indeed 
criticized the countermeasures, but the climate was clearly 
milder than before. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said 
that the EU Commission will hold a meeting with the Greek 
Government in the next few days to find a solution without the 
need to take the issue to the European Court. It appears that 
neither France nor Germany want to send Greece to the European 
Court, as Foreign Ministers Alain Juppe and Klaus Kinkel 
stressed the need for a mutual settlement of the dispute. The 
only countries that seem to favor sending Greece to the European 
Court are the Netherlands and Denmark. The foreign ministers of 
these two countries made separate statements urging the EU 
Commission to send Greece to the European Court.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Any deal on Britain's future voting rights in Europe 
which amounts to "a national veto by the back door" will not be 
approved, the Government was warned today. 
  The leader of the majority Socialist group in the European 
Parliament, Jean-Pierre Cot, made it clear the necessary minimum 
vote to block Euro-legislation had to be 27 in practice. 
  Otherwise, he said, EU [European Union] accession terms for 
Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria will not get the legally 
required backing from Strasbourg. 
  "The Council of Ministers would do well to take account of 
this point when it decides now on a blocking minority," he said. 
  Accession requires the votes of 260 of the 518 MEPs [members 
of the European Parliament] by early May if enlargement is to go 
ahead on time at the start of next year. 
  The leader of Britain's 45 Labour Euro-members, Pauline 
Green, said she hoped enlargement would go ahead but warned: 
"John Major is not out of the woods yet. He has a Cabinet 
meeting tomorrow which could well see him lose his foreign 
secretary. All this is of his own making." 
  A majority of the centre-right Christian Democrat MEPs -- 
the 
group to which the 32 British Tories are allied -- are also 
likely to oppose endorsing an enlargement deal which gives 
Britain or any other government a firm blocking option with less 
than 27 votes. 
  The fear is that even if the Cabinet accepts the terms of 
the 
weekend compromise -- offering a "reasonable time" to find 
agreement where more than 23 but less than 27 votes are mustered 
against EU laws -- some other EU governments will reject it, 
throwing the Union into renewed confusion. 
  "All bets are off it that happens," said one official in 
Brussels today. 
  The responses of the 12 governments to the compromise will 
be 
made tomorrow, probably by "written procedure" -- followed by a 
formal gathering of ministers in Brussels on Wednesday [30 
March] if a deal is on. 
  But any celebrations would have to wait until the European 
Parliament delivers its final verdict.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by news </F>
announcer Josef Broukal in the television studio in Vienna -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Broukal] Our colleague Langer [who compiled a 
report on the compromise reached by the foreign ministers of the 
European Union on the blocking minority that aired prior to this 
interview] just said that no one is really happy with this 
compromise. Are you happy with it? 
  [Mock] I am satisfied because it was the right step in the 
right direction for the first time in three weeks. One must not 
forget that there has not been any progress at all during the 
past three weeks. Today we had the possibility of really 
holding discussions with individual colleagues. I was able to 
talk to my three colleagues from the Scandinavian countries. 
Then we met Foreign Secretary Hurd and the Spanish foreign 
minister. I would say there is a fair chance that a solution 
will be found this week or next week. Hurd advocated the 
British position, but he indicated clearly that he wants a 
solution, even in the form of a compromise. 
  [Broukal] Mr. Foreign Minister, this is precisely what we 
have tried to find out here all afternoon -- namely where is the 
compromise? As far as we understand the matter, it is said that 
in the future Great Britain cannot prevent anything, unless it 
says that it wants to prevent something. That means, how long 
will this period be during which Great Britain can say: No, we 
are not satisfied, we must still hold discussions? Is there a 
day as of which this objection is no longer valid, because only 
this would be progress? 
  [Mock] This will certainly be discussed in Brussels tomorrow 
or the day after tomorrow -- whether or not there will be a 
specific point in time. However, I may give you a positive 
example. In Austria's social partnership [talks between 
representatives of employers and employees] there is no specific 
period for negotiations and, nevertheless, negotiations are 
always held until a result has been achieved with the agreement 
of all four parties. This is a system of which the world is 
envious. 
  [Broukal] This means -- if I try to translate what you just 
said -- with its resistance Great Britain has achieved 
[recognition] that its objections cannot simply be ignored. 
  [Mock] Correct. I believe that this must be granted, if 
there is not more behind it. 
  [Broukal] If I ask you to take a bet now: What are the 
prospects that Austria can continue with its schedule for 
membership in the European Union as planned? 
  [Mock] The working hypothesis still remains that we will be 
able to stick to our schedule and hope become a member of the 
European Union on 1 January 1995. 
  [Broukal] Thank you for your visit to the studio, Mr. 
Minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "We </F>
Are Not Junior Partners"] 
  [Text] In Russia and in the West, a vigorous debate is in 
progress on the chances for Russian-U.S. partnership. Can the 
two superpowers really become equal partners? Some observers 
consider the question to be at least premature. Others are 
already prophesying a new form of rivalry. I think both those 
positions are wrong. We Russian democrats who are behind this 
policy have encountered tough political -- even armed -- 
resistance. Unfortunately, during these turbulent days, there 
were times when we were neither understood by our friends and 
allies in the West nor did we receive sufficient support from 
them. Even in the current critical situation -- we in Moscow 
need every conceivable assistance -- we hear threats of curbing 
economic cooperation from the West. 
  Such threats are provocative and senseless. Behind those 
threats, there seems to be a manic desire to recognize the 
United States alone as a world power. However, if the United 
States wants to solve every problem in the world alone, it will 
overreach itself. 
  Incidentally, despite the difficult situation in which it 
finds itself, Russia remains a superpower, not only because of 
the arsenal of nuclear weapons that it possesses, but also 
because of its raw materials, technical know-how, and strategic 
position. The principles of "strategic partnership" that were 
formulated in Vancouver in 1993 and in Moscow in 1994 remain as 
important as ever. Those lofty declarations of intent must be 
translated into concrete facts. 
  Instead, reactionary forces are seeking to create myths. For 
example, it is asserted that Russia is condemned to having a 
totalitarian regime forever and will always pursue a 
confrontational course vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Such 
myths can easily become reality, if the the treaties that our 
presidents have signed are not observed. 
  Some politicians in Washington and elsewhere only want to 
assign Russia the role of a junior partner. In their view, a 
"good Russian" is always an obedient Russia, never a leader. 
What should Russian democrats think about the new chauvinist 
tones that can be heard from Washington? Russia cannot accept a 
subordinate role in world politics. That would be unjustified 
and politically dangerous. Nationalist extremists and other 
reactionaries would soon profit from the acceptance of such a 
role. They are really trying to do that already. 
  If we do not shortly begin to develop a strategy and 
appropriate mechanisms for a mature relationship with a 
realistic basis (can we venture to use the German term 
"realpolitik" to describe it?), the Russian and U.S. prophets of 
catastrophe will exploit the current situation in the way they 
want. Both countries would only lose out as a result.

  [Text] Mainz (DDP/ADN) -- According to the Association of 
Democratic Doctors (VDAA), Turkish authorities have probably 
taken 150 election monitors from Germany into custody in the 
Kurdish town of Batman. The VDAA stated today in Mainz that the 
representatives from political and medical, as well as human 
rights organizations are no longer able to move freely and 
contact their offices in Germany. The situation faced by 
election monitors in the towns of Van and Diyarbakir appears the 
same, they said. The detained Germans had traveled to Turkey to 
follow the local elections in the Kurdish area of the country. 
In view of the behavior of Turkish police, the VDAA fears for 
the physical and mental well-being of the election monitors and 
in particular the Turkish interpreters. 
  Alliance 90/Greens MP Angelika Beer reported from Diyabakir 
today that groups of monitors had been detained and forced to 
return, after being threatened with weapons in some cases. For 
example, after they had been taken back from the town of Cizre 
to Diyabakir, the Turkish Air Force had bombarded a village near 
Cizre. In the process 14 people had been killed she said.

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 26 Mar--Dr. Mulack Gunter, Germany's 
ambassador to Kuwait, has confirmed that his country's embassy 
in Baghdad would remain closed until Iraq applies all UN 
Security Council's resolutions regarding the respect of the 
State of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence. [passage omitted] 
  He expressed his wish that Kuwait would channel its 
investments to German industry, in particular, and to the new 
regions in Germany after the unification of the east and the 
west, which would allow Kuwait to contribute to modern German 
technology and to benefit from it. 
  The ambassador stressed that economic relations between 
Kuwait and Germany were developing steadily and are being 
strengthened in both directions, the proof being the various 
Kuwaiti investments in Germany. 
  The ambassador has also denied that his country was arming 
fundamentalists or extremists and said that those allegations 
were groundless. He added that some extremists and 
fundamentalists are based in Germany as residents and used to be 
involved in some political activities, just like Kurds, Turks, 
and some Palestinians.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
has firmly warned the militant Kurds in Germany against taking 
part in nonapproved demonstrations. The minister's spokesman, 
Karl-Heinz Schneider, announced today in a DDP/ADN interview 
that steps would be taken against any people participating in 
such actions "with the full severity of the criminal and aliens' 
law." The government and states had closely cooperated to 
prepare measures aimed at preventing acts of violence. This 
included the provision of a large number of Federal Border Guard 
(BGS) officers. 
  In view of the possibility of violent clashes involving 
Kurds 
in Cologne, Mannheim, and other cities, Kanther called upon the 
peaceful Kurdish population not to follow the calls of violent 
Kurds. Bus companies were on no account to provide transport 
for the banned PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Kanther 
expressed his expectation that Germany's neighbors would prevent 
Kurds clearly bent on violence from crossing the border into 
Germany. 
  At the same time, the minister asked travelers to show 
understanding for any delays caused by police measures. At 
railway stations, BGS and traffic police officers were also 
being asked to pick up recognized violent Kurds and prevent them 
from traveling further.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has harshly criticized 
comments by Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman 
Scharping on the Kurdish issue. State Minister Schaefer stated 
in Bonn at noon today that Scharping has made a bad faux pas. 
The minister-president from Mainz has obviously overlooked the 
fact that the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, has been 
responsible for terrorism in Turkey and abroad for years. 
  In an interview with NORDWEST-ZEITUNG, which is published in 
Oldenburg, the SPD chairman had advocated the view that the 
European Union and NATO have watched the genocide of the Kurds, 
while doing practically nothing so far. The Federal Government 
must exert political pressure on the developments in Turkey and 
bring about a restriction of arms exports. At the same time, 
Scharping condemned the violent riots by Kurds in Germany. 
  Heiner Geissler, deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group, has 
called on the European Union to negotiate with Turkey on an 
autonomy statute for the Kurds. Speaking to SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, Geissler said that, since they are particularly 
affected, the Germans must seize a corresponding initiative in 
the European Union. At the same time, the CDU/CSU politician 
came out against deporting Kurds en masse to Turkey. In his 
view, this would not lead to a calming down of the domestic 
climate, but rather to further escalation.

<F P=106> ["ban" report: "Federal Government Intends To Discuss </F>
Deportation Agreement"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 25 Mar -- Before negotiations are held with 
the Turkish Government about an agreement on the deportation of 
violent Kurds from Germany, the Federal Government intends to 
discuss the legal wishes and possibilities. In this spirit, 
government spokesman Vogel interpreted statements by Interior 
Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) on Friday [25 
March], who had called an agreement with Turkey desirable, in 
which the government in Ankara should commit itself to adhering 
to international human rights standards in potential trials of 
the people affected. The day before, Kanther explained that he 
had "contacted Foreign Minister Kinkel so that we could come to 
something like a deportation agreement with Turkey, in which 
Turkey promises under international law that Kurds who committed 
acts of violence and who are deported from Germany are not 
sentenced to death in Turkey because of the prior deed." On 
Friday morning (local time) Kurds occupied the German Consulate 
General in Melbourne, Australia, for 30 minutes; then they 
withdrew. No damage was caused, it was said in Bonn. 
  Spokesmen of the Federal Government insisted on Friday that, 
in any case, it will remain so that Kurdish demonstrators must 
not be deported if they are threatened with a death sentence or 
with torture in Turkey. Kanther's statements caused problems of 
interpretation in the Federal Government since, by making them, 
the minister recognized that Turkey is violating human rights. 
Interior Ministry spokesman Dauke said that the goal of the 
considerations could be a "binding promise" by Turkey to abolish 
obstacles to deportation that exist in Germany. With a view to 
the international human rights conventions, which have also been 
signed by Turkey, government spokesman Vogel said that the 
Federal Government "assumes" that Turkey is adhering to the 
agreements. Potential additional agreements were given 
primarily domestic importance by Vogel; these could increase the 
acceptance of decisions for deportation. 
  In the Federal Government it is still unclear what a 
deportation agreement with Turkey could look like. Foreign 
Minister Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) ordered 
officials of his Ministry to examine the matter. Following the 
violent demonstrations, at the beginning of the week the FRG 
Interior Ministry, the FRG Justice Ministry, as well as the 
Foreign Ministry were ordered by the Cabinet to examine the 
existing legal situation; they are also supposed to examine 
whether new laws are necessary. The Federal Cabinet will discuss 
a draft on this matter at the end of April. The government 
spokesman said that, even though the principle of reasonableness 
is to be observed in decisions concerning deportations, it is 
primarily the government's task to ensure security and order. 
However, valid laws and practice obviously do not deter from 
committing acts of violence. 
  With a view to human rights violations in Turkey, Vogel said 
that the Federal Government has repeatedly told the Turkish 
Government "tactfully but also very clearly" that it must adhere 
to the norms of the Council of Europe, which it has signed. 
However, no pressure should be exerted on Turkey. The "Workers 
Party of Kurdistan" (PKK) is a terrorist organization. 
Terrorism must be and may be fought also in this case. 
Referring to the situation reports by the Foreign Ministry, its 
spokesman said that the Federal Government is "concerned" about 
the observance of human rights in Turkey. Kinkel has repeatedly 
made this clear to his Turkish interlocutors. 
  The government's commissioner for foreigners, 
Schmalz-Jacobsen (Free Democratic Party of Germany), said in a 
newspaper interview that one must not react with the slogan "All 
Kurds out!" to the demonstrations. The aliens' law regulates 
the conditions for deportation. "Wherever it is necessary and 
possible deportations must be carried out." It is not necessary 
to amend the laws. 
  Social Democratic Party of Germany Deputy Bernrath also 
warned against amending the aliens' law. Greens European Deputy 
Roth said that her party supports "the peaceful demonstrations 
of Kurds in the FRG." As long as Turkey violates the principles 
of a rule-of-law state and of human rights, Kurds must not be 
deported from Germany. 
  On the previous day, the Turkish ambassador to Bonn had 
called reports about reprisals against Kurdish separatists 
propaganda. In contrast, Seelig, a Berlin Party of Democratic 
Socialism deputy who is currently in Diyabakir, said that last 
week "eight villages were destroyed just in the area of Lice, 
many people were kidnapped, and at least two young men were 
killed." His group, which wants to examine the conditions in 
the region, has repeatedly been threatened and hindered by the 
Turkish military.

  [Text] We welcome the German Government plans, in the wake 
of recent regrettable incidents in Germany, to extradite to 
Turkey some of our citizens who have committed crimes here in 
Germany. We declare that we are ready to cooperate with the 
German authorities in this matter. 
  Allegations to the effect that those who will be extradited 
will be executed or tortured in Turkey consists entirely of the 
propaganda waged by extremist organizations. This is what we 
are explaining to the Germans. We are discussing these issues 
with various organs. Such a mechanism exists between the 
Foreign Ministries of both countries. We have a committee 
comprised of the under secretaries of the Foreign, Justice, and 
Interior Ministries. Moreover, we decided to set up a 
cooperation committee between the Turkish and German Justice 
Ministries. I believe that it will not be difficult to reach an 
agreement with Germany on these and similar issues. It is 
important to trust one another and I believe that this mutual 
trust exists.

Kanther is still seeking a legally binding agreement with Turkey 
which would rule out the use of the death penalty against 
deported Kurds. Kanther stressed in Bonn today that a 
deportation agreement of this kind is still "necessary." At the 
same time, he announced that all criminal proceedings and 
proceedings relating to laws on foreigners against violent 
criminals of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) would be 
completed "as soon as possible."

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Kanther: The PKK Will Not Be Left </F>
in Peace"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) has emphatically warned the banned 
extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] against the 
continuation of its violent actions on German soil. In the 
event of further obvious infringements of the law, the state 
will react "very clearly and in a tough manner because softness 
is apparently considered a weakness on our part," Kanther stated 
in an interview with DIE WELT. The appropriate instruments are 
the penal code, the aliens' law, the law relating to 
associations, and particularly "serious consideration of 
deportation." Since it is obvious that numerous PKK supporters 
do not primarily fear the German penal code but are more afraid 
of having to leave the country, deportation must be applied as 
far as possible, Kanther stressed, confirming the government's 
position. 
  At the same time Kanther spoke in favor of examining all the 
Kurdish associations, some of which have recently been founded 
and which should be considered cover organizations for the PKK. 
Since the PKK continues its "conspiratorial activities" despite 
its ban in Germany, the minister demanded that the authorities 
should constantly examine PKK activities. The PKK should know 
that it "will never again be possible for the party to carry out 
their activities unimpeded" if it continues to resort to 
violence. "We will continue to disrupt them." 
  However, this position toward militant Kurdish extremists 
does not rule out "establishing closer relations with the 
peaceful Kurdish and Turkish population," Kanther stressed. Not 
all Kurds are PKK supporters. Many of them are threatened by 
PKK criminals and are afraid. In this connection, Kanther 
appealed to the overwhelming majority of the law-abiding Kurdish 
population in Germany to "reject" the influence of violent PKK 
criminals. The minister regretted that so far they have not 
"distanced themselves sufficiently" from the PKK. 
  According to Kanther, the burden for internal security 
resulting from extremism among foreigners and general crime 
among foreigners represents a major challenge for the state. 
Serious crimes are often committed by foreigners who stay only 
for a short period in Germany, including particularly 
asylum-seekers. 
  Yet internal security continues to be threatened by German 
extremists, too. During the interview, the interior minister 
admitted publicly for the first time that the antiterrorism 
operation of Bad Kleinen has only brought "little progress 
concerning the knowledge about the terrorist Red Army Faction 
[RAF]." However, the evaluation of the documents of the 
suspected terrorist Hogefeld has not yet been completed. 
  Irrespective of the numerous "tensions, splits, and cracks" 
within the RAF groups, one must still proceed from the premise 
that the terrorists continue to be dangerous, Kanther stressed. 
Yet there is no certain reply to the question as to whether the 
RAF is determined to continue carrying out individual terrorist 
operations. There is no doubt that the perpetrators have also 
realized the "obvious failure of RAF terrorism to change social 
conditions." According to Kanther, the reason for the current 
ideological debate within the RAF is the "emerging realization 
of the complete absurdity of their operations." 
  It is difficult to assess whether it is possible for the 
state to promote this process of reflection through certain 
signals, the minister pointed out. However, the state must 
refrain from "wrong interpretations." "This was the reason I 
insisted that the Bad Kleinen incident should be cleared up 
completely to refute the myth that a helpless man had been 
killed by the police." 
  Kanther made it totally clear in this respect "that RAF 
criminals must be treated in the same way as other offenders." 
Those who obviously no longer represent a danger to their 
environment after many years in prison, those who repent their 
crimes and pledge not to commit any similar ones in the future 
can be spared punishment and pardoned on the basis of the 
existing law. However, "if RAF criminals declare their 
continued support of violence and would thus represent a danger 
for their compatriots in freedom, they cannot be released."

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "RAF Split?"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- "Currently profound developments 
are taking place" in German left-wing extremist terrorism. This 
is revealed by an analysis of the current situation by the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], in 
which the authority points in particular to important changes in 
the situation within the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). The 
RAF is entangled so much in quarrels about its direction that 
there has even been a split of the militant extremist 
organization, the BfV report says. Its so-far stable structure 
-- a complex construct consisting of the so-called command 
echelon, the "prisoners' collective," and about 250 supporters, 
the "RAF scene" -- has "broken apart." 
  Links between members of the RAF scene and the also 
left-wing 
extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) are known. Thus, the 
authorities noted recently that an activist who belongs to the 
RAF scene participated in a "leading function" in a 
PKK-controlled Kurdish solidarity rally in Bonn. At a meeting 
of the Hanns-Seidel Foundation in Budapest, BfV Vice President 
Frisch discussed the "international ties" of the RAF scene. 
There he cited the "participation in demonstrations against the 
PKK ban and the trips of some members of the RAF scene to 
Turkey." 
  However, Frisch did not talk about PKK support by the RAF 
command echelon or of a "massive, in particular logistical 
support," the BfV said, correcting corresponding media reports 
yesterday. 
  The RAF has further expanded its contacts and its ties with 
other European terrorist groups. This also applies to its links 
with the banned Turkish extremist organization "Devrimci Sol" 
(Revolutionary Left [Dev Sol]). In the meantime, the "Dev Sol" 
has even been integrated in the "SpinnenNetz" [CobWeb] mailbox 
system, which was started in 1991 -- an information and 
leadership instrument of the inner RAF scene, which is 
camouflaged as an "information shop" of the "antifascist action."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ilan Mor, spokesman of the Israeli </F>
Embassy in Bonn, by Hans-Joachim Wiese; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] Good day Mr. Mor. 
  [Mor] Good day, Mr. Wiese. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck has 
caused great outrage. The chairman of the Central Council of 
Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, has called for the search for the 
"mental instigators." How do you assess this attack? 
  [Mor] Of course, we assess it in the same way as Mr. Bubis 
and all other politicians who have commented on the attack so 
far. Israel is observing with close attention what is happening 
in Germany in the sphere of radicalism and anti-Semitism. Like 
everybody else in Germany, we are naturally concerned. 
  [Wiese] Is this attack a confirmation of your fears -- of 
the fear that a new anti-Semitism is emerging in Germany? 
  [Mor] Well, anti-Semitism exists in Germany anyway and, 
unfortunately, everywhere else in the world. Every now and then 
-- not to say regularly -- our fears are confirmed. This is 
naturally a big cause for concern. We are confident that the 
German authorities will do everything possible to prevent such 
events. Unfortunately, such incidents still occur. This is 
very, very bad. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, how do you assess the measures that are 
being taken in Germany against the danger for Jewish 
institutions and the danger for foreigners? Do you think that 
the measures are sufficient? 
  [Mor] Well, I am not in a position to make such an 
assessment. However, the Israeli Government and the Israeli 
citizens in Israel are confident that the German authorities are 
doing everything possible to protect the foreigners and other 
minorities in Germany and to prevent such incidents. Emnid 
published the results of an opinion poll a few days ago. A 
total of 22 percent do not want a Jewish neighbor. This is very 
telling. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, you just talked about possible Israeli 
reactions to events in Germany. Is Israel concerned about 
incidents like the one that just happened in Luebeck? 
  [Mor] Yes, of course. As I just said, for us this is a big 
cause for concern. We are convinced that Weimar is not possible 
in Germany today. However, a total of 40,000 Jews and other 
minorities are living in Germany. There are numerous foreigners 
in Germany who would like to be protected. Of course, we all 
must do everything possible to provide such protection. As I 
just mentioned, Israel is closely following what is happening in 
Germany. Anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism naturally exist 
all over the world. However, against the backdrop of the events 
of 1933 and 1945, such events assume great significance because 
they are occuring in Germany of all countries. 
  [Wiese] Thank you, Mr. Mor. Good bye. 
  [Mor] Good bye.

Countries Now Thinking About Us?"] 
  [Text] [Hoeren] What are the effects that the [arson] 
attack on the synagogue [in Luebeck] has on the Germans' image 
in the world? 
  [Kinkel] The arson attack on the synagogue in Luebeck hurts 
Germany's reputation. We must relentlessly persecute and 
prosecute the perpetrators of this abominable deed and thus make 
it clear that we are a rule-of-law state, that we reject such 
individual deeds, which cannot be justified in any way -- and 
that we have learned from history. 
  [Hoeren] In other countries fear of Germany is growing. Are 
the concerns justified? 
  [Kinkel] Unfortunately, these terrible attacks always give 
the impression to public opinion abroad that there is a broad 
right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic movement in the FRG. Of 
course, this gives rise to concern. It is our task to put 
things into the proper perspective. The other countries must 
know: These are evil individual acts, for which we are 
ashamed.... 
  [Hoeren] What are the effects of these right-wing extremist 
attacks? 
  [Kinkel] Moelln, Solingen, and Sachsenhausen have not yet 
been forgotten in the world. I see this in many talks with 
foreign politicians. My interlocutors mostly know that these 
are individual incidents. 
  However, the media abroad often present a different picture. 
Therefore, it is so important that we Germans give clear signs 
against xenophobia with, for instance, chains of lights, 
demonstrations, and friendliness toward foreigners. Xenophobia 
must be nipped in the bud. Never again must hatred of 
foreigners, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism emanate from Germany.

Political Barometer, the prospects for victory of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] have improved considerably in 
the voters' assessment. 
  According to the poll, 61 percent of Germans think that the 
SPD will win the Bundestag elections in October. In February 
this was the opinion of only 49 percent. Only 23 percent still 
think that the government coalition will win -- six percentage 
points less than a month before. According to the poll, 
approval for a potential red-green coalition at the federal 
level has also increased. It rose by 9 percentage points to 31 
percent most recently. 
  Another picture resulted from the question about voting 
behavior if elections were held next Sunday. The SPD got 39 
percent -- just as much as in February. The Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union lost 1 percentage point 
and went down to 36 percent. The Free Democratic Party of 
Germany remained unchanged at 6 percent and the Alliance 
90/Greens at 9 percent. The right-wing extremist Republikaner 
received 4 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the 
successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, 3 percent.

<F P=106> ["Erl." report: "Banque de France and Bundesbank More in </F>
Agreement Than Ever"] 
  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main, 25 Mar -- The French and the 
German central banks are determined to continue to place price 
stability at the center of their policy. Both central banks are 
in closer agreement than ever regarding their views and goals. 
This was stated by the presidents of the two central banks, 
Jean-Claude Trichet and Hans Tietmeyer, at the financial forum 
in Frankfurt. This event, which dealt with the French capital 
market and German- French cooperation in the financial sector, 
was organized by Paris Europlace and FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. In 
Paris Europlace more than 100 public and private organizations 
have united with the goal of making Paris internationally more 
important as a financial center. 
  Speaking to about 500 leading domestic and foreign financial 
experts, the central bank presidents stressed that it is 
particularly important to present the policy of stability in a 
credible way. The newly created European Economic Institute is 
comprehensively supported in its work by both central banks. 
Trichet expressed readiness to give those countries of the 
European Union, which might need it, time to fulfill the 
necessary criteria of convergence during the development toward 
a European monetary union. 
  When describing the current German situation, Tietmeyer 
warned against postponing necessary decisions. More flexibility 
on the labor market must be a priority issue at the moment, 
Tietmeyer said. Only then can the high unemployment be reduced. 
The latest wage agreements show that this is now seen more 
clearly than in the past. However, one is still hesitant about 
corrections. 
  Both central bank presidents agreed that extending the 
fluctuation ranges in the European Monetary System, with which a 
crisis was mastered in August 1993, was a correct decision. 
Trichet called for a pragmatic and realistic method of action 
if the mechanism were to be changed again one day. Tietmeyer 
said that a potential date for narrowing the fluctuation ranges 
cannot yet be predicted. The advantages and disadvantages of 
such a measure must be weighed carefully. "I believe that, for 
the time being, one should be content with keeping the exchange 
rates de facto stable," Tietmeyer said. He promised that the 
Bundesbank will continue to examine whether there is leeway for 
further reductions of the interest rate. "However, this must 
not endanger the necessary further progress concerning 
stability," he added. He promised a continuing "policy of a 
calm hand." At a time of nervous markets the Bundesbank must 
and will keep to its course, he stated. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Christiane </F>
Oppermann; place and date not given: "Period of Grace for 
Heirs"] 
  [Text] [Oppermann] Taxes have reached record heights. And 
it is continuing: the solidarity surcharge as of 1995, the 
petroleum tax as of 1996. Where else do you want to cash in? 
  [Waigel] It is true that we have reached the climax of the 
tax quota, and the overall burden must not rise any further. By 
the way: I have never talked about the petroleum tax. 
  [Oppermann] Thus, there will not be any additional burdens 
on car owners? 
  [Waigel] It was clear from the very start that the railroad 
reform would produce deficits that must be covered. The raising 
of the petroleum tax in January was a first step toward paying 
the debts of the railroads. I do not accept that, despite the 
privatization of the railroads, there will still be an 
8-billion-mark [DM] deficit each year as of 1996. Here the 
transportation politicians must make proposals to cover this 
deficit. For instance, one could think of privatizing the 
highway net. But this is possible only if fees can be levied 
for private road construction. This is the point. 
  [Oppermann] Fees for using roads instead of higher petroleum 
taxes? 
  [Waigel] I do not commit myself to that. The proposals must 
come from the transportation politicians. On the other hand, I 
have always taken care that taxes also have a guiding function 
in the spirit of environmental protection. 
  [Oppermann] Thus, the only way that remains is once again 
putting your hands into the taxpayers' pockets? 
  [Waigel] Right after reunification many people who now 
criticize me advised me to raise taxes. There would be 
readiness to make sacrifices for a national task, they said. 
This was one of the biggest lies of life that have been 
repeatedly invented in Germany. There has never been any such 
solidarity. Man makes sacrifices only if his own existence, his 
own job is at stake. 
  [Oppermann] There are also other tax sources that you could 
tap much more strongly than in the past. Inheritances, for 
instance. 
  [Waigel] I warn against tapping inheritance taxes as a 
source of income. The people would consider this as cold 
expropriation. 
  [Oppermann] There will be no raising of the inheritance 
taxes with you? 
  [Waigel] I have always said that we need a differentiated, 
constitutional adjustment of the basic values, which date back 
to 1964.... 
  [Oppermann] ...which automatically means higher inheritance 
taxes.... 
  [Waigel] ...not necessarily. This depends on the tax credits 
and the rate of taxation that would be valid then. Raising 
inheritance taxes would have disastrous effects on medium-sized 
companies, in trade, and in agriculture. 
  [Oppermann] And what have been the results of taxes on 
interests? Are you happy with that? 
  [Waigel] No one asks whether the finance minister is happy. 
Here, too -- as I feared -- there was capital flight.... 
  [Oppermann] ...with the help of the bank, which advised you 
for the draft. 
  [Waigel] Everyone tries to make a profit -- also the state 
banks, allegedly because otherwise they would suffer 
disadvantages in competition. Even though a large amount of the 
money is coming back to Germany via investment funds, the topic 
of tax flight is so unpleasant that we must find a European 
settlement with the inclusion of some OECD states, such as 
Switzerland. During the second half of 1994, when we take over 
the presidency of the European Union, I will turn this into a 
focal issue. 
  [Oppermann] You want to put an end to Luxembourg as a 
paradise for capital flight? 
  [Waigel] Quite certainly. Luxembourg must come to 
understand that, in the end, nobody benefits from that. 
  [Oppermann] Tax on interests does not yield what you have 
hoped. You need money and you must save. The state quota is 50 
percent, in 1989 it was only 45 percent. How is it supposed to 
go down? 
  [Waigel] In 2000 we want to be back at the level of 1989, 
that is, the year before unification. The state's share in the 
people's income has not been raised just out of fun or because 
of a policy of excessive expenditures but because an entire 
national economy was grafted onto ours. After the 
transformation of the eastern state economy into a private 
economy and through consolidation and limitation of expenditures 
-- the federal budget must not grow more quickly than the GNP, 
that is, it may increase by 3 percent at the most -- the state 
quota will go down again. 
  [Oppermann] Why do you not tackle subsidies and abolish, for 
instance, half of the subsidies for the coal mines? 
  [Waigel] I admit that more should have been done regarding 
the reduction of subsidies because of economic reasons and that 
too much time has been taken and too many social considerations 
were made. If North Rhine-Westphalia had had the same amount of 
money available for restructuring instead of for coal, everyone 
would probably be better off. Coal subsidies remain on the 
agenda. Displeasure is growing in the Bundestag. The southern 
laender no longer have any understanding for the special role of 
North Rhine-Westphalian coal mining and already last year they 
wanted to abolish the coal pfennig. The eastern laender do not 
understand why their mines are restructured with small financial 
subsidies while those in the west get billions. 
  [Oppermann] And what about the billions in subsidies to 
industry? 
  [Waigel] Just a moment. In the west we have reduced 
financial subsidies by one-quarter. The total of subsidies have 
increased only because we are spending more in the east to 
guarantee economic reconstruction. 
  [Oppermann] Does Germany not urgently need further 
reductions of the interest rates to get out of the economic 
crisis? 
  [Waigel] Reductions of the interest rate must be achieved by 
hard work. This is possible only if the public sector does not 
use the capital market so much. In 1995 we will have a year of 
consolidation, in which the raising of loans on the capital 
market will go down by one-third. This is a decisive step to 
safeguard the stability and the exchange rate of the German 
mark. The course set by financial policy and the moderate wage 
agreements give the Bundesbank leeway for lowering the interest 
rates.

successfully made its first test flight. The one-seat combat 
plane, the follow-up model of the disputed Fighter 90, is 
extremely maneuverable and can reach almost twice the speed of 
sound. According to Deutsche Aerospace, the unit price is to be 
no more than 100 million German marks. In addition to Deutsche 
Aerospace, British, Italian, and Spanish companies are also 
involved in the development of Eurofighter 2000.

<F P=106> [Theo Sommer article: "When Marianne Quarrels With Michel"] </F>
  [Text] An honest man who is sent abroad to lie for his 
country -- that is how diplomats were defined in rougher times. 
Since French Ambassador Francois Scheer let off steam at a Bonn 
meeting with journalists last week this definition has had to be 
altered: The diplomat is a paragon of discretion who is sent 
abroad to commit indiscretions in the interest of his country. 
  The ambassador let it be understood that the ghosts of the 
past had risen once again. The differences over the 
nonparticipation of the chancellor in the commemorative 
ceremonies in Normandy and Bonn's refusal to allow the Allies to 
stage a farewell military parade in Berlin should be viewed 
against a "background of general mistrust." France needs 
"clarity from Germany" that nothing will change about Germany's 
place in West Europe as a result of the transfer of the seat of 
the government to Berlin, relations of a new kind with Russia, 
and the expansion of the European Union [EU] to the north and 
the East. There is much that still has to be done for 
reconciliation to develop into friendship. 
  This has caused a minor tempest in a teapot. There were few 
signs of perceptiveness -- according to Max Weber, "the ability 
to allow reality to affect one while remaining calm and 
collected" -- in German reactions and commentaries. There are 
three points that need to be set out and contrasted with that. 
  First, in view of differing national interests, 
temperaments, 
and memories, the Franco-German relationship remains difficult. 
However, as it has evolved over the past few decades, it is 
enduring enough to survive temporary irritations. It is not -- 
regardless of ambassadorial garrulousness or ministerial 
bluntness -- in trouble at the present time. 
  Just as the Maastricht Treaty was a product of a 
Franco-German initiative, there are many other things that have 
emerged from joint Franco-German efforts since then: The 
European Council's Copenhagen resolution, which opens up 
prospects for admission for the countries of Central and East 
Europe; the decision to offer the countries of the East 
cooperation with the Western European Union [WEU] to supplement 
the Partnership for Peace; and the Kinkel-Juppe proposal for 
Bosnia, which the Americans have made their own in the meantime. 
  There are countless examples of successful cooperation -- 
the 
GATT negotiations, which the Germans helped to lead to a 
successful conclusion without France losing face; the subtle way 
in which France was brought into NATO via the Eurocorps; the 
close coordination of the two EU presidencies, Germany first and 
then France, with an emphasis on drawing East Europe into the 
Brussels community and promoting stability in the entire Eastern 
region. 
  Second, it is true the Germans have still not found their 
role in the world following the Cold War, reunification, and 
communism. We still do not know what we should want. However, 
that is no less true of the French. The ECONOMIST diagnosis 
was: "The old certainties regarding national solidarity and 
cultural integrity, especially things connected with France's 
place in Europe, which is continuing to develop, have collapsed. 
They have been replaced by worry." 
  Paris feels it has been forced to the periphery. For a long 
time, it has called on the Germans to finally assume a degree of 
responsibility that is commensurate with its size and influence. 
However, as soon as the government prepared to do just that, the 
ghost of a German desire to achieve a dominant position loomed. 
Sometimes, this concern almost sounds like Clemenceau's caustic 
Gallic complaint that there are "20 million Germans too many." 
  These fears on both sides must be discussed -- the German 
fear of being made to stand in the corner once again and French 
fears that if the focus of Bonn policies shifts to the north and 
the East, then France will be forced to the sidelines of the 
European arena. Klaus Kinkel must initiate such a dialogue in 
Paris this week. 
  Third, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the future, 
there may be a temptation to seek refuge in the hackneyed 
certainties of the past. The ceremonies that are planned to 
mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy 
smack of anachronism; there is a feel of smoke-filled back rooms 
in which veterans associations preserve past memories about 
them, of regimental rooms where relics of the past are 
displayed. The chancellor is not to be present as if victory 
over the Germans were being celebrated rather than a triumph 
over Nazi ideology. Why is one staging a retrospective of this 
last great battle rather than celebrating European union? 
  The government is in a huff ("concerning ceremony for the 
end 
of World War II: German presence is not envisaged"). The 
chancellor is having rumors spread that one cannot expect him to 
take part in an event that involves celebrating the defeat of 
Germany. How can this stupid statement be reconciled with 
Bonn's secret desire to be present? That would only be possible 
if it were admitted that 6 July 1994 marked the beginning of 
defeat and Germany's liberation from the Nazi yoke. However, 
making that kind of statement is something that many in Bonn 
still find distasteful. 
  "Ten centuries of European history are visible in the 
background" is how Ambassador Scheer explained French mistrust. 
Is the point not that real history should now be made out of 
past events? Should one not heed Nietzsche's words of warning: 
"There is a degree of sleeplessness, of ruminating on things, 
of historical awareness that drives life out of things to the 
point of its extinction." 
  Last fall, Helmut Kohl spoke about Franco-German friendship 
before the Senate in Paris. He said on that occasion that not 
all the evil spirits of the past had been banished in Europe 
once and for all. Every generation faces the task of preventing 
their return anew, of shedding old prejudices, of allaying 
suspicion. Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping expressed himself in very similar terms 
recently. He advised that Bonn foreign policy should display 
clarity with regard to substance, modesty and restraint in its 
style, and sensitivity toward neighbors. The meaning of the 
criticism leveled by the French ambassador, who is a 
dyed-in-the-wool European, was not that different. The dialogue 
that he has called for is not only due, it is overdue. In the 
Europe of the future, a Europe of Romance, Germanic, and Slavic 
peoples, Germany and France constitute the indispensable hinge 
between north and south and East and West. This hinge needs to 
be oiled urgently.

<F P=106> ["Nm."-initialed editorial: "After the Incident"] </F>
  [Text] The visit of a German foreign minister to Paris is 
something quite common within the framework of the Franco-German 
routine. As a result of the undiplomatic remarks made by the 
French ambassador to Bonn, this time it was different: One 
expected a clarifying word on the alleged or real clouding of 
bilateral relations. In the statements immediately after the 
incident mutual relations were hastily hailed; however, such 
solemn declarations have become hackneyed over the decades. 
  Thus it was good that Kinkel was able to come up with 
something practical in Paris: the idea of presenting a kind of 
joint government program for the period that the two countries 
hold the presidency of the European Union [EU] -- Germany in the 
second half of 1994, France in the first half of 1995. This is 
a lofty word for the cumbersome task of mediating, which one has 
to fulfill as EU president. Moreover, it is domestic policy 
that will play the main role in the two countries during this 
time: in Germany because of the Bundestag elections in October, 
in France because of the presidential elections in spring 1995. 
It is, therefore, uncertain whether good resolutions can 
translate into noteworthy action. Still, it is some progress 
that an attempt will be made to break out of the shortness of 
breath of the six-month rhythm in the EU. 
  In Paris, Kinkel spoke of a "joint vision for the future of 
the Union." This is exactly what is lacking. In Germany the 
idea is fading that Europe could be unified on the basis of 
federal states; with the formulation "enlargement and 
simultaneous deepening," Bonn is asking for something like the 
squaring of a circle. In France, large parts of the political 
class are convinced that German unification has altered the 
foundation of the policy of integration -- which is why 
Ambassador Scheer only expressed a truism. Views in Paris, 
however, differ as to what conclusions should be drawn from it. 
Franco-German talks have for a long time been dominated either 
by day-to-day political business, or they have degenerated to 
noncommittal phrases. It is high time Bonn and Paris compared 
what each side means when they speak of "Europe." The councils 
and bodies where this can be discussed have existed for a long 
time. All that is needed is to use them.

Cooperate"] 
  [Text] The royal reception that France gave the German 
foreign minister in Paris was not intended to counter the worry 
that is seizing our neighbors when they think of Germany. 
Kinkel's handshake with Juppe, Balladur, and Mitterrand had 
been planned for a long time. However, the criticism of the 
French ambassador, who indicated that Paris did not know how to 
treat the new Germany, and that the new Germany was striking a 
false note, has presented the situation in bright light. 
  The crisis has been averted, but distrust remains. It cannot 
be dispelled even by the most excellent speech. France's 
foreign-policy oligarchy is asking itself what secret plans 
Germany has for Europe. With the European Union [EU], Paris 
wants to protect French interests and tie Bonn firmly to the 
central countries of the West. When Kohl and Kinkel are now -- 
in the Elysee's view -- obsessed with pushing EU enlargement 
toward the north and East, this would hit French foreign policy 
in a weak spot. Is even this chancellor -- who is actually a 
European -- intending to free himself from the chains that 
Germany has put on itself, free himself from the firm links to 
the West -- this is the question French diplomats are asking, 
sometimes in a low voice, sometimes very loudly. 
  A flat no is not an answer. It takes time for a new, 
weatherproof relationship to establish. In the second half of 
1994 Bonn will assume the EU presidency, Paris in the first half 
year of 1995. The challenges for Europe remain -- in the East 
and in the Mediterranean, even though this is where Europe has 
failed. This forces the two partners to come up with joint 
concepts unless the two successive presidencies are intended to 
inaugurate a lost year.

  [Text] Paris, March 28 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur on Monday [28 March] suspended a controversial plan to 
pay young people less than the minimum legal wage, government 
spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said. 
  Balladur suspended the plan for a week at a meeting with 
youth leaders on Monday. 
  Sarkozy said the government would organise a conference, 
which he called "a youth states-general," to restore dialogue. 
  A ministerial committee consisting of Education Minister 
Francois Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon and 
Youth and Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, would organise 
the conference, Sarkozy said. 
  He also said that Michel Bon, director-general of the 
national employment agency ANPE had been charged by Balladur to 
set up "a job-seeking system" for youths. 
  A youth leader walked out of the meeting because Balladur 
did 
not withdraw the jobs plan completely. 
  Cecile Amar, of the high school students' federation FIDL, 
said she also walked out because Balladur said he did not have 
the authority to grant two other demands. 
  These were that court cases against student demonstrators be 
dropped and two Algerians who were deported last week for 
alleged theft and throwing stones at police during a rally in 
Lyon, eastern France, be brought back. 
  Amar said a planned national demonstration next Thursday 
would still go ahead. 
  Also in the youth delegation was Philippe Campinchi, 
president of the pro-socialist UNEF-ID students union, and Bob 
Injey, leader of the pro-communist UNEF. Ad hoc groups 
coordinating the protest campaign in technical universities and 
nationally were represented by Helene Joubert and Christophe 
Hode. 
  Speaking on Sunday after claiming victory for his 
conservative coalition in local elections, Balladur had pledged 
to move "to re-establish dialogue" over his jobs plan, following 
a month of sometimes violent protests by students and trade 
unions. 
  Balladur said that the plan had only been a government 
attempt to fight unemployment, but it had been "interpreted as 
showing a lack of attention" towards young people. 
  "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the 
government," 
he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people." 
  Balladur said said it was "the duty of society to offer 
young 
people a future. And for this we should start by 
re-establishing dialogue with them and examine the various 
possible solutions." 
  With Balladur were Labour Minister Michel Giraud as well as 
Sarkozy. 
  Under the jobs plan, aimed at reducing unemployment, young 
people under 25 with diplomas or university degrees were to have 
been paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of 
working time, the remaining time being spent on training. 
  Unqualified youths would be paid 20 percent less than the 
minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. [passage

  [Text] Paris, March 25 (AFP) -- Heavily-armed riot police 
clashed with youngsters in the French capital Friday [25 March] 
when tens of thousands of students marched to demand the 
withdrawal of a government cut-price jobs plan for young people. 
  Several hundred youths outside the peaceful main body of the 
march threw rocks and stones at police who retaliated with baton 
charges, making a number of arrests. Five officers were injured. 
  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua called in 3,300 riot police 
after predicting there would be "1,000 trouble-makers" hidden 
among the peaceful protestors. 
  Thousands of young people also turned out in provincial 
cities across the country, after serious unrest in the western 
cities of Nantes and Rennes overnight. 
  In Lyon, eastern France, about 10,000 young people rallied, 
there were 4,000 at Besancon and 2,000 at Perpignan in the 
south-west. 
  In Nantes another demonstration began Friday after clashes 
overnight between hundreds of student militants and police for 
the third time in a week. Thirty police, a television cameraman 
and at least two demonstrators were injured, authorities said. 
Twenty-two arrests were made. 
  In Rennes, youths hurled rocks and bottles at police who 
riposted with tear gas for two hours early on Friday. Six 
police and one youth were injured and 11 people were arrested. 
  In Paris, students organised their own system of guards to 
prevent vandalism and fighting. Shopkeepers rolled down their 
steel shutters and the authorities closed down metro stations on 
the route. 
  A group of 50 "white helmets" were there to monitor police 
behaviour and the way any arrests were made, a spokesman said. 
The group was wearing white caps. 
  Student anger over the government plan has been heightened 
by 
uncertainty about their future in a country that has 3.3 million 
unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom 
more than 750,000 are under 25. 
  The plan states that young people with diplomas or 
university 
degrees may be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 
percent of working time, with 20 percent of training. 
  Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study 
and 
trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older 
workers and replacing them with poorly-paid youths.

  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- French voters cast ballots 
Sunday [27 March] in second-round local elections expected to 
confirm a slight recovery by the beleaguered Socialists as well 
as a consolidation by the ruling center-right coalition. 
  In the first round last Sunday, the two parties in Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition and their allies garnered 
44.59 percent of the votes, the same score as in March 1993 
general elections in which they trounced the then-ruling 
Socialist Party. 
  The Socialists made a respectable showing last weekend, 
taking more than 22 percent of the votes compared to 17.59 in 
the disastrous legislative election. 
  Up for grabs in the second round run-offs were 1,372 
councillors' posts in France's 95 departments. 
  Only about a third of the races had clear-cut winners in the 
first round. 
  The election is also Balladur's first national-level test 
since he came to power a year ago. He is widely believed to 
have presidential aspirations. President Francois Mitterrand's 
term ends in May of next year. 
  Turnout as of 5:00 p.m. [1500 GMT] was about 48 percent, 
down 
slightly from last Sunday, the Interior Ministry said. 
  Polls closed at 6:00 p.m. [1600 GMT] in most areas, except 
in 
large cities, where they were to remain open an extra two hours. 
  The voting comes after a week of angry and sometimes violent 
demonstrations by students opposed to a government plan to fight 
record unemployment by letting businesses pay young people a 
lower minimum wage. 
  Political analysts said the effect of the demonstrations at 
the ballot box was hard to predict. 
  The occasional outbursts of violence by the students might 
translate into support for the government and its efforts to 
fight crime, the analysts said. But at the same time, the 
students' opposition to the government employment plan might be 
reflected in the electorate as a whole, the analysts added. 
  In any case the election is not expected to cause any major 
shift in the balance of power on the local level. 
  Right-wing parties currently control 75 of the country's 95 
departments, compared to 12 for the socialists, six for their 
left-wing allies and two for the communists.

  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur claimed victory for his conservative coalition in local 
elections Sunday [27 March] and hinted that he would modify a 
controversial plan to lower the minimum wage for young people. 
  Speaking on television after polls closed in the 
second-round 
voting, Balladur said the French people had "confirmed the 
results of the first round" in which the two right-wing parties 
in his coalition won more than 44 percent of the votes. 
  Balladur thanked the French people for their support "all 
the 
more because these are difficult times" -- an allusion to a wave 
of student protests over the past two weeks against his youth 
employment plan. 
  Conceding that his proposals "are causing concern," Balladur 
said he would announce an initiative in the next few days "to 
reestablish dialogue." 
  "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the 
government," 
he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by </F>
announcer Etienne Leenhardt and journalist Albert Du Roy -- live] 
  [Text] [Leenhardt] In spite of the fact that it is quite 
late, we are live with the interior minister, who is still at 
the ministry. Good evening Mr. Pasqua. 
  [Pasqua] Good evening. 
  [Leenhardt] Mr. Pasqua, you were delighted after the first 
round of the cantonal elections. Are you as happy this evening? 
  [Pasqua] Listen, the election results must be taken as they 
come. One can see that the parliamentary majority has had good 
results. As far as seats go, the votes were better distributed 
among the Left than within the parliamentary majority. Besides, 
the candidates of the National Front prevented the winning of 
some seats. Therefore, as we said earlier on, there has been a 
change in the majority in some departments. 
  [Leenhardt] Albert Du Roy. 
  [Du Roy] Yes. Charles Pasqua, you hoped -- the majority 
hoped -- to get a victory in more departments than is the case. 
How do you explain ... 
  [Pasqua, interrupting] Mr. Du Roy, you know in how many 
general/councils we already have a majority, don't you? 
  [Du Roy] 75? 
  [Pasqua] Yes. Listen, we are in a democracy. One cannot 
hope to have 100. Besides, it is obvious that it would have 
been attempting the impossible to think that the Socialist Party 
would disappear in some departments where it has been deeply 
rooted for a long time. We are not the ones who said that we 
hoped to win such or such a department. The observers did. Of 
course, we would be happy if we had won them. 
  [Du Roy] The second round took place today. For you, is this 
vote mainly local or national? 
  [Pasqua] I believe that it is first and foremost a local 
vote, but one cannot ignore its national aspect. I am not 
giving you a noncommittal answer, I am only saying that it is 
obvious that the cantonal elections are first and foremost local 
elections. Some of this evening's results confirm this. 
Moreover, mobilization has been more successful with left-wing 
voters, insofar as they have heard and heard again that the 
majority was threatened in some departments. This is why they 
mobilized more. I would like people to see things as they are. 
This evening, as far as seats are concerned -- although we do 
not have all the results, since we are still without the results 
in 32 cantons -- may I say that the great victors are the 
parties close to the majority and those close to the opposition. 
  [Du Roy] Let us now go beyond the cantonal elections. 
Earlier on, the chairman of the French Democratic Union, Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing, said that one of the messages of the vote was 
that the government had to speed up reforms. Do you agree with 
him? 
  [Pasqua] Yes. However, for the government to speed up 
reforms, it would be necessary for those who -- or at least, 
this is what I think -- support the government to do so and to 
leave it to its work. 
  [Leenhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Pasqua. You were 
speaking live from the Interior Ministry.

  [Text] Marseille, France, March 28 (AFP) -- Bernard Tapie, 
the flamboyant politician and businessman who owns the Olympique 
Marseille football team, has been indicted in connection with 
fraud in the club's accounts, officials revealed Monday [28 
March]. 
  The officials, who spoke after Tapie's stunning victory 
Sunday in a local election with 67.88 percent of the vote, did 
not reveal the exact charges, but said examining magistrate 
Pierre Philippon discretely indicted Tapie on March 10. 
  It was Tapie's third indictment. 
  Officials at the public prosecutor's office said Philippon 
was probing alleged "forgery and embezzlement" in the club's 
accounts after then Justice Minister Michel Vauzelle in 1992 
ordered an investigation into nine French clubs, including 
Marseille. 
  Tapie, 50, was charged last month with bribery and 
interfering with witnesses involved in attempts to pay three 
Valenciennes players to throw a game against Marseille last May 
20. 
  On December 22, he was charged with embezzlement at Bethune, 
northern France, in a case involving the Testut weighing machine 
firm in his business empire. 
  Tapie, urban affairs minister in the socialist government 
ousted last month, swept to victory in a former communist-held 
constituency over far-right National Front candidate 
Marie-Claude Rossignol. She received 32.13 percent of the vote. 
  Tapie, who is also Marseille MP for the Radical Left, an 
ally 
of the Socialist Party, said after the first round of voting on 
March 20 that he was now aiming for the mayoralty of France's 
third largest city in municipal elections in 1995. He also 
plans to head the Radical Left list in the European elections in 
June. 
  Earlier this month, Tapie reached an accord with the 
state-owned loss-making Credit Lyonnais bank to write off his 
debts and to sell off all his business interests in his empire, 
Bernard Tapie-France, with a mortgage on his personal fortune. 
  The risk for the bank could be up to 500 million francs 
(84.8 
million dollars). Right-wing MP Philippe de Villiers called for 
an inquiry into the debt write-off. 
  Before the Valenciennes scandal, Marseille won the French 
championship for the fifth consecutive year and on May 26 its 
fortunes were at their zenith when Marseille beat A.C. Milan to 
win the European Cup, becoming the first French club to do so. 
  On September 6, football's governing body in Europe, UEFA, 
barred Marseille from the European Cup.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Fleury: "Edouard Balladur One Year </F>
After His Appointment as Head of State: `I Have Not 
Changed...'"] 
  [Text] "I have not changed. I have set my course and I 
will not be diverted from it. My goal is that after two years 
here in the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], France 
should be doing better. The record of this first year shows 
many improvements." 
  Edouard Balladur has published the record of his first year 
in government a few days ahead of schedule -- he was asked to 
form the government on 29 March 1993. It is a document of 
around 100 pages which, with the help of graphs, reviews in 
detail all the issues tackled during this first year of change 
and takes stock of the results obtained. It is a generally 
positive record and one which is very encouraging for the 
majority and the head of government. 
  Its publication on the eve of the second round of the 
cantonal elections is no accident. Although the Matignon denies 
turning this election, which is expected to reinforce the 
majority, into a test of approval of the government's policies, 
this early presentation will certainly prompt some gnashing of 
teeth within the majority and criticisms from the opposition. 
But the Matignon is calm. According to the prime minister's 
entourage, he has never tried to turn the cantonal elections 
into a test of his popularity. "It is not he who has said that 
this election would make it possible to assess the popularity of 
Balladur's policy. But since it has been turned into a test, it 
must be admitted that it is not bad for him. He will not 
complain!" 
  He is complaining still less because the situation in France 
after the initial 12 months of his term of office is improving. 
Although the economic indicators are still flashing dangerously, 
they show real progress and make it possible to predict a 
resumption of growth for the end of the year. The institutes 
are unanimous in forecasting growth of 2 percent in December 
compared with negative growth (minus 1 percent) in March 1993. 
  "When we came to power," the prime minister points out, "we 
found a situation characterized by recession, unemployment, an 
increased deficit in the budget and social security fund, a lack 
of growth, and a moral crisis" which had plunged the country 
into deep pessimism. The government has set to work in a 
five-year timeframe, and deliberately ignored the presidential 
election. Indeed, Balladur notes, the main problems which the 
government encountered involved the stagnation of society and 
the upcoming presidential election rather than with 
cohabitation. Moreover, this cohabitation has always gone well 
and has in no way hampered the government's work. 
  Balladur's main concern was therefore to extricate himself 
as 
much as possible from the stranglehold of the preparations for 
the presidential election, although the Matignon points out that 
history contains many prime ministers who crossed the Seine 
[from the Matignon to the Elysee presidential office]. His 
second concern was of a pedagogical kind: Not imposing reforms 
on the French people but explaining them in advance to ensure 
their acceptance. Was that the right method? "I wonder," he 
said, "whether I was wrong or right to place the emphasis on the 
difficulty of carrying out reforms." Because, by raising the 
question, you generate debate and raise problems which go beyond 
the issue at hand. 
  The prime minister is nonetheless categorical: The 
government could not move more rapidly. The situation was worse 
than expected. "We found a fragile and worried society. We had 
to do things gradually, with as much consultation as possible," 
which led to "some criticisms" about lack of government action. 
Remembering the past 12 months, Edouard Balladur remarked 
without bitterness: "I have sometimes felt loneliness." 
  But the preliminary results are in. They are encouraging 
with regard to the main parameters of government action -- 
unemployment, budget control, the restoration of the social 
security fund, foreign trade, and security. 
  -- Unemployment: The increase in the number of people 
seeking work is slowing down. It was 20,000 in the last three 
months of 1993 compared with 80,000 registered in the last three 
months of the Beregovoy government. It is a slowing down which 
is full of promise and reflects the first effects of the 
government measures. The prime minister, who refuses to engage 
in a quarrel over statistics, refutes the criticisms which blame 
him for the increase in unemployment from March to September 
1993. "The measures which we took as soon as we came to office 
could not have had an effect before September." It was from 
then that an improvement was recorded. "I do not see how we 
could be held responsible" for the continued rise in 
unemployment between April and September "when the measures 
taken could not have immediate effects." 
  -- Control of the state budget: The situation was not 
hopeful when the transition [of government] took place. The 
"budget deficit" was estimated at 343 billion francs [Fr]. The 
five-year law adopted by the new government were expected to 
reduce the deficit to Fr317.6 billion. The austerity measures 
which were taken made it possible to improve that forecast. The 
settlement of the budget resulted in a deficit of Fr315.7 
billion. The government, whose objective is to reduce this 
deficit to Fr200 billion in 1997 (2.5 percent of GDP), notes 
with satisfaction that this initial result exceeds expectations. 
  -- Social security: The balance has been maintained even if 
it meant increasing the CSG [General Social Contribution] by 1 
percent. Edouard Balladur makes no secret of the fact that the 
problem of social security funding remains worrying. By the end 
of the century, the whole system of the organization and funding 
will have to be reviewed in accordance with the world economic 
situation. He is categorical: "We will not accept a leveling 
down." 
  -- Foreign trade: As soon as it came to office, the 
government was faced with the GATT negotiations. It faced 
American demands and European hesitations with great 
determination and imposed a fair compromise. 
  -- Security: The functioning of justice has been improved, 
the fight against crime has been given new resources. Together 
with a more stringent limitation of immigration, this issue was 
one of the French people's priorities. 
  "We were elected to ensure that the state regained full 
control. We have done a great deal, but a great deal remains to 
be done," Edouard Balladur reaffirmed. Without dwelling too 
much on his positive record, he lists the main stages of 1994 in 
terms of a continuation of reforms which will take up all of 
Parliament's work: new measures for employment; reform of family 
allowances; reorganization of social security; the police; 
justice; the overseas departments; fiscal reform; the military 
programming law; the law on decentralization and regional 
development. "We are tackling all the major issues which 
concern France between now and the end of the century." With 
the desire to develop and increase solidarity "to ensure that 
nobody is left out." 
  One subject concerns the prime minister particularly. He 
does not understand the obstinacy of high school and university 
students in demonstrating against a so-called "youth minimum 
wage" which "I would never accept." The provisions of the CIP 
[job training contracts], although they were originally not well 
drafted, are "not directed against young people. Our only 
concern is to help young people find a first job, to find 
something other than the ANPE [National Employment Agency] when 
they leave the school system." It is not natural for us to beat 
records for youth unemployment in Europe. Why should a system 
that has proven its efficiency elsewhere not be feasible in 
France? The prime minister's entourage, more incisive than him 
on this point, referred to a degree of manipulation of young 
people, a kind of protest organization to generate a social 
explosion. "We have been predicting problems for a year. 
Social explosion has become a fashionable subject. By talking 
about it, you give people ideas." 
  For Edouard Balladur these demonstrations "reveal the deep 
disquiet which affects young people," lost between a society 
ruled by old regulations and technical progress which calls all 
values into question. This disquiet also affects the whole of 
society. "We must take more account of the world's development. 
The (economic) emergence of the developing countries means that 
the countries of Western Europe face a risk of being pushed to 
the fringes." Reforms are therefore necessary to ensure that we 
adapt and enter the new millennium in good condition. "It will 
take us a good 10 years of adaptation." But, fortunately, if 
growth picks up again, society will look to the future more 
calmly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa by Enzo </F>
Cirillo in Rome; date not given: "Silvio, All Those Lies..."] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Cirillo] Minister, are you upset by the 
accusation that [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi made during the 
debate with [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] 
Occhetto, namely, that you are a liar and that you provided 
misleading figures concerning the state's accounts? 
  [Spaventa] Of course, and what I found most offensive was 
the 
way this lie was presented... 
  [Cirillo] The prime minister answered for you... 
  [Spaventa] Ciampi did a very commendable thing. His 
solidarity made me very happy. I am very grateful to him for 
what he did. [Spaventa ends] 
  Thus Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa broke the interview 
"truce" earlier than expected. He made himself available to 
answer questions. He even lost some of that self-control which 
occasionally made him unsympathetic to many people. He spoke, 
explained, joked. 
  [Cirillo] What would you have replied to Berlusconi had you 
been in Occhetto's place? 
  [Spaventa] I would have simply answered the substance of the 
question -- namely, that the gap between the forecasts and the 
real situation must be blamed on the recession. 
  [Cirillo] In any case, the general state accountant's 
calculations were wrong. 
  [Spaventa] (The minister, who, when speaking on television 
and in the latest episodes of this electoral campaign, has 
resurrected a slightly more marked Roman accent than usual, 
stated:) I already explained the situation. The calculations 
were only partly mistaken. As regards two-thirds of the gap -- 
some 10 trillion lire -- this was due to recession, which caused 
a reduction in public income. As regards the remaining 5 
trillion, clearly miscalculation was involved. This 
miscalculation, however, was smaller than last year's, when the 
gap was estimated at 15 trillion. Also this year's figures for 
the first quarter, which were somewhat puzzling to tell you the 
truth, did not help us at all to outline a precise picture for 
the lira. 
  [Cirillo] In order to counter your line of defense, 
Berlusconi referred to a CORRIERE DELLA SERA article by Mario 
Monti, the rector of the Bocconi school, who spoke of the need 
for a 20 trillion package to balance public accounts in 1994. 
  [Spaventa] I have gone through all my calculations again, 
and 
I have written a letter to CORRIERE, challenging my friend 
Monti's figures. A 20 trillion package is not needed to balance 
the state's accounts; I am more than ever convinced of this. 
Monti's calculations are wrong, and his figures bear no 
relationship to reality. I believe Monti's figures are very 
questionable. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Vittorio Sivo report: "Labor `Pole' Born"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- It was rather impressive to see them all 
sitting side by side, exchanging comments and smiles, and to 
hear them talking in the plural -- "we want to tell the 
country...," "we are convinced...," "we have decided..." --in a 
chorus of voices without a single discordant note. Two days 
before the elections, Luigi Abete, Bruno Trentin, Sergio 
D'Antoni, and Pietro Larizza [respectively, General 
Confederation of Italian Industry, Confindustria, chairman; 
Italian General Confederation of Labor, CGIL, secretary; Italian 
Confederation of Trade Unions secretary; and Italian Federation 
of Trade Unions, UIL, secretary] chose the foreign press center 
to celebrate a very special event -- the collapse of the 
symbolic iron curtain that has always, despite any agreements, 
separated the public statements of Confindustria and the trade 
unions. Now their joint news conference and joint statement, 
read out by a trade unionist on behalf of both sides, suddenly 
made the conflicts and controversies of years of stormy 
relations seem part of the distant past. 
  "We are here together to issue a message of calm and 
stability to the country," said the Confindustria chairman. "We 
are here as independent organizations that have sometimes been 
in conflict; nobody intends to relinquish his own role. But at 
this time of delicate transition from the First to the Second 
Republic, we feel a shared responsibility for guarding the 23 
July 1993 agreement, which represented not a mere episode but a 
radical change of course in the entire system of industrial 
relations," the CGIL secretary explained. 
  To [President] Scalfaro, who received them jointly yesterday 
morning, the industrialists and trade unions' representatives 
addressed the following request and promise: first, that the 
president act as guarantor of the continuity of the "heritage of 
rules, methods, and objectives" embodied in last July's 
protocol; second, an offer of a guarantee by both sides -- 
industry and labor -- to keep their conduct "consistent" with 
the agreement signed almost a year ago. An agreement, as they 
pointed out, that has hitherto ensured "strong social stability." 
  From both the president and from [Prime Minister] Ciampi, 
whom they visited the previous day, the Confindustria and trade 
union representatives received "not formal reassurances, but 
committed replies," as Trentin explained, "from people who, like 
us, believe that we must protect one of the most important 
experiments that Republican democracy has managed to produce." 
  Was this unusual move dictated by the fear of a leap into 
the 
unknown represented by the elections? This suspicion was also 
voiced by foreign reporters, who were as amazed as everyone else 
by the spectacle of so much concord and who are accustomed to 
the seeking after recondite causes typical of Italian politics. 
"Do not lower the tone of this initiative by asking the usual 
question about `what lies behind it,'" Abete began. "What I 
mean is that next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday [29-31 March, 
following elections] will be normal, calm days," the 
Confindustria chairman said, as though to suggest that nobody 
believes that the barbarians are at the gates. "If we were 
gripped by fear, we would not be here together," Trentin said; 
"instead we would be waging a war of communiques. The fear, if 
any, is that since the future will not be easy -- because the 
next government will face some very tough decisions -- the 
fabric that we began to weave last summer will become unraveled." 
  To state forcefully, as Luigi Abete did, that "agreements 
must be honored" and, as Trentin, D'Antoni, and Larizza did, 
that "the rules established by the July protocol cannot be 
changed without a consensus," does not mean using some kind of 
"blackmail" against the future government. "This is no kind of 
pressure on the next government," the UIL leader said, "but a 
confirmation of an option that remains valid, irrespective of 
the outcome of the elections." 
  The message grew clearer when it became apparent that it was 
also addressed to the international markets: "We want to 
communicate that we are very confident of our capabilities and 
our strength," Confindustria Deputy Chairman Carlo Callieri 
summed up. "We want to tell the country and the international 
public that they can depend on Italy and that Italy can depend 
on itself." 
  There was such an attitude of deference that nobody wanted 
to 
claim credit for being the first to propose the establishment of 
a common front. It is no sudden move, but the result of a long 
shared task, a policy of consultations ratified by the August 
1992 agreement. The idea was born one evening a month and 10 
days ago, "when the five of us met," Callieri revealed. And it 
was precisely in order to ensure that the joint move was not 
misinterpreted, Abete explained, that Confindustria and the 
trade unions agreed in rejecting the possibility of deferring 
their joint statement until after the election. 
  The next government, whichever it may be, was asked not to 
jeopardize the policy of reform started by the Ciampi 
government, partly thanks to the July protocol. "The fall in 
inflation, the lowering of interest rates, and the interest 
shown by foreign markets," the joint document states, "have 
enabled enterprises to exploit the regained competitiveness of 
the exchange rates to make a considerable recovery in exports, 
in terms of volume, shares, and margins, with a significant 
change of direction in the balance of trade. Unfortunately, 
however, the actions to facilitate a recovery of employment have 
proved less effective." But Confindustria and the trade unions 
are demanding a number of most urgent measures from the present 
government: additional regulations covering public contracts, a 
report on unemployment, an inquiry into labor costs, and an 
assessment of the three-year research plan.

<F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report: "Martinazzoli: `They Both Lost'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- They fought tooth and nail for over an hour 
and a half, but it was not enough. Even at a distance, Forza 
Italia's leader and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
secretary are still exchanging very heavy blows, and between the 
two combatants the center is condemning them both and 
proclaiming itself the winner: "Occhetto and Berlusconi only 
know how to fight, and have nothing to say. We do not like 
either of them, and the voters will vote for us." 
  "No, we cannot accept it: Berlusconi is turning the clocks 
back. He can only conceive of politics as `anti' something, not 
as a blueprint applicable to the whole of the national 
community." The duel is over, but Achille Occhetto has not 
changed his mind about his adversary, Silvio Berlusconi. 
Indeed, he is reaffirming and reinforcing it: "Berlusconi does 
not meet the need for the establishment in this country at last 
of a new Left and a new Right, both capable of aiming at 
government. He is unable to acknowledge that we have entered 
the new phase, of alternative programs." 
  Occhetto absolutely cannot accept Berlusconi's observation 
that "if the Left wins there will be no return match." Occhetto 
pointed out that Berlusconi "has not withdrawn it, and this is 
the most disturbing aspect of this new Right that has rallied 
around Berlusconi." 
  These were tough and uncompromising assessments. They are 
not surprising, however, inasmuch as the Forza Italia leader is 
the number one enemy of the progressive forces. But the 
comments from the center were no less fierce, though addressed 
to both rivals, and not just to Berlusconi. The main criticism 
was for the length of the debate, which lasted much longer than 
expected and which supposedly jeopardized the center by focusing 
attention only on the Right and the Left. Mario Segni, the Pact 
leader, wrote to media watchdog Giuseppe Santaniello to protest 
and to demand an opportunity to recover his disadvantage. "The 
`Trial of Strength' television program has always lasted 45 
minutes," Segni pointed out. "On the occasion of the debate 
between Occhetto and Berlusconi, it lasted at least an hour and 
40 minutes. Since this creates an objective disadvantage with 
respect to the time made available to the Pact for Italy, I 
request that appropriate measures be taken with the necessary 
promptness to calculate the necessary adjustment in terms of 
time and benefits due to the Pact for Italy." 
  As for matters of political substance: "If what emerged on 
television is Italy's Right and Left, then we are in trouble. 
It was a drawn match, which I believe persuaded people not to 
vote for either of the two. I believe that the center will 
benefit from it." 
  Mino Martinazzoli did not watch the duel on television: 
"Nevertheless, I formed an idea of it from reading the 
newspapers," the Popular Party secretary commented drily, "and 
it confirmed to me that people can only watch such things out of 
pure masochism." Martinazzoli too believes that the voters will 
have concluded from the duel that neither the Right nor the Left 
is trustworthy. "They have tried to convince people with the 
idea that only they will be in the running. They use 
spectacular methods, and commit many instances of immoderation, 
both public and private. Ultimately, however, that suits me 
fine, because the more they talk, the more our own arguments are 
strengthened." 
  In other words, according to the representatives of the 
center, the Occhetto-Berlusconi duel backfired. [Italian 
Republican Party, PRI, Secretary] La Malfa confirmed this: "The 
debate was the most obvious proof to all voters of the poverty 
of the arguments of both alignments, both Left and Right. The 
two contestants oscillated between very petty personal polemics 
and an absolute lack of incisiveness in presenting their 
respective stances." La Malfa's conclusion was that "the 
election campaign has been very useful: It has deflated two 
sham alignments and brought to light their complete absence of 
policies and programs." 
  The debate was also examined during the political discussion 
on RAI channel two. According to Giuseppe Ayala [Democratic 
Alliance], "Occhetto made the best impression," against a 
Berlusconi who was "on the defensive," while the National 
Alliance's Francesco Storace saw in Occhetto "the promise of a 
defeat. I saw him succumb for the second time, after his 
encounter with [Italian Social Movement and National Alliance 
leader] Fini." According to the League's Franco Rocchetta, the 
PDS leader has "great skills as a performer," whereas Berlusconi 
"is a more normal person, which is why he has gathered more 
support." [Radical leader] Marco Pannella said Berlusconi was 
the winner: "Keeping in mind that it was Berlusconi's first 
time, whereas Occhetto is an expert in debates, Berlusconi 
should score an extra point for doing well."

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Franco Coppola in Rome on 24 March: "Berlusconi Trying To 
Conquer Presidency"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] At 1400, among the 
stalls displaying drawings and trinkets, and surrounded by 
journalists and curious passers-by, Berlusconi announced that he 
considered President Oscar Scalfaro a fixed asset of the Second 
Republic. "As far as I am concerned, I see no reason why 
Scalfaro should not complete his term of office, in accordance 
with the provisions of the Constitution." Therefore, Scalfaro 
should stay on the Hill [president's palace] until 1999, the 
Knight [Berlusconi nickname] said. 
  [Coppola] So, in your opinion, Scalfaro is untouchable? 
However, your allies, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi and 
Gianfranco Fini [leader of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] are 
saying, instead, that... 
  [Berlusconi] Please do not put words in my mouth. I never 
said "untouchable." I could never be so arrogant as to state or 
pronounce my opinion in those terms. I am only saying that the 
issue of the president of the republic has never been presented 
by the allies. 
  [Coppola] This may be so, but Bossi is saying the opposite, 
he is saying that Scalfaro should pack his bags. 
  [Berlusconi] By now Bossi is making it his profession to 
make 
statements against everything and everybody. 
  [Coppola] However, Fini is also saying that the president 
will have to step down. 
  [Berlusconi] I believe this is not the right moment to 
address this issue. I have expressed my opinion. We will see 
what happens later. They have never taken up this issue with 
me. I believe it ought to be discussed at the right moment. We 
must first see how Italians vote, see the actual figures. 
  [Coppola] Some people are suggesting that a change is taking 
place in the "institutional" political scene -- namely, that you 
are undermining the agreement between the PDS [Democratic Part 
of the Left] and Scalfaro. 
  [Berlusconi] I do not believe you can speak of alliances as 
far as the president of the republic is concerned, because the 
head of state must be above the opposing sides. I believe that 
Scalfaro is very much aware of this rule, and that he is fully 
observing it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Giovanni Valentini: "Center Counterattacks: `We </F>
Are the Government'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] The Pact for Italy 
turned up in force at the foreign press center for a group 
picture in memory of the center-left. Mario Segni [Pact for 
Italy leader] was flanked by socialist former Prime Minister 
Giuliano Amato; Republican Secretary Giorgio La Malfa; Valerio 
Zanone, former Liberal Party secretary and chairman; and 
prospective Popular Party Secretary Buttiglione. "We are 
competing," the Pact leader said, "because in fact there is not 
a two-pole system; we represent the only government alliance. 
The rest are merely electoral alliances, a fraud. Neither of 
the two could form a solid government even if it did gain a 
majority." La Malfa, with his political expertise, drew 
journalists' attention to the physical presence of the center. 
"As you can see, there are a lot of us at this table; and we are 
all here together. The others cannot do this, however, neither 
on the Right nor on the Left. This is the proof that the two 
poles do not exist." 
  With the help of some slides from the marketing bureau 
experts, which were shown and commented on by economist Mario 
Baldassarri, the Pact highlighted what it considers its 
adversaries' weak points. Forza Italia has presented 39 
proposals for tax reductions and spending increases. That would 
cause the public deficit to increase from 160 to 220 trillion 
lire, while the ratio of the debit against GDP would rise from 
117 to 125 percent. According to the Pact's analysis, the pole 
of freedoms would bring us higher taxes, less development, and 
more unemployment. 
  The center accused the National Alliance of pursuing "19th 
century style statism" and of intending to reintroduce 
corporations into the economy and into society. The League, 
however, was accused of having drawn up a "program for the 
republic of the Po Valley" that would grant greater powers to 
Milan than those currently held by Rome. 
  The criticisms of the left-wing front were no less severe. 
According to the center, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
is presenting "unacceptable and statist proposals"; it is 
advocating "real socialism in inexorable installments"; it 
threatens to increase fiscal pressure to 50 percent. As for 
Communist Renewal, according to the Pact, it still embodies the 
old paradox of the "party of struggle and of government." In 
other words, its internal inconsistencies concern not only tax 
on treasury bills but also our exit from NATO. 
  In their exchange with foreign journalists, Segni and his 
group strongly emphasized that their alignment represents the 
utmost renewal. "It was I," the promoter of the "yes" vote 
proudly recalled, "who promoted the referendums and who set this 
process in motion." Furthermore, there has been such extensive 
renewal within the Pact's ranks that 85 percent of its 
candidates are not former parliamentarians but ordinary members 
of society: One of the prominent figures at the conference 
table was university lecturer Augusto Fantozzi, considered one 
of Italy's top tax experts, who is running for the Senate in 
Rome. 
  Following these claims, it was natural that questions would 
center on the personal background of the speakers, from Segni to 
Guiliano Amato, from La Malfa to Zanone, all representatives and 
survivors of the First Republic. Former Prime Minister Amato 
made it clear that his decision to withdraw from politics was an 
entirely personal one: "I have not put myself in quarantine, and 
I intend to contribute to the change, both as a citizen and as 
an academic." As for La Malfa and Zanone, it is well known that 
the former has relinquished his candidacy, while the latter is 
running for the Senate in a particularly difficult constituency 
-- central Turin -- in order to counter "a right that is 
liberal-democratic in name alone." 
  "The institutional reform is still only half finished," 
Segni 
said in order to explain the transition, stressing the need to 
change the electoral law by introducing two rounds and the 
direct election of the prime minister. The Pact leader, the 
center's candidate to the prime ministership, is still the only 
politician officially in the race for the premiership, and it is 
perhaps partly for that reason that he says repeatedly that "the 
vote for the center is not a wasted vote," since "it excludes 
the extremes" and averts the danger of Gianfranco Fini's 
[Italian Social Movement and National Alliance leader] entering 
the government, or the PDS and Communist Renewal together.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance leader Ferdinando </F>
Adornato by `d.m.' in Bari; date not given: "No Extremists in 
the Government"] 
  [Text] Bari -- "But we have already said this," Ferdinando 
Adornato repeats, commenting on [Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS, Secretary] Occhetto's television appearance. Yesterday the 
Democratic Alliance [AD] leader was in Puglia, first at Bari, 
then Taranto and Foggia, walking around in a region that has 
such a large number of AD supporters and admirers. "Yes, I saw 
Occhetto. What can I say? We have provided an illustration of 
the progressive alliance's objective of a progressive government 
for quite some time back." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence, no to Bertinotti and his Communist 
Renewal party in a government of the Left? 
  [Adornato] The problem is simple and we have always stated 
it. It is a question of consistency. There are sectors in the 
progressive alliance who do not believe in the unity of 
progressives, but in that of the Left; moreover, Ingrao said so 
just too explicitly, precisely in reference to the word 
"progressive" itself. And these sectors do not believe in, or 
rather are not looking to governing the country. They believe 
in, and are looking to introducing an extremist policy. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Whilst the progressives should... 
  [Adornato] In the first place we should state that not all 
progressives are in this alliance. I am referring in particular 
to the Catholic democratic world which has not chosen the AD or 
the Christian socialists, but who have preferred to defend, 
pointlessly, the political center, which makes no sense under 
the majority system. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Let us say, of the progressives. 
  [Adornato] Good, in this alliance not everyone believes in 
or 
wants the prospect of governing. And then it is correct to say 
that this is not our problem. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Not at all? 
  [Adornato] No, it does not concern us because our intention 
is to give birth to a large democratic and reformist party which 
can govern our country in a totally new way. Communist Renewal? 
Nor should one become obsessed with individual parties or 
movements; the important thing rather is to overcome the 
barriers, though without losing one's own identity. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But is a progressive government possible 
without Bertinotti? 
  [Adornato] I will repeat myself for the umpteenth time: If 
certain parties do not have a social and economic policy with 
which to govern, that is not our problem. We want to govern. 
But we have also loyally accepted the alliance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian Social Movement </F>
secretary and National Alliance leader, by `s.m.' in Rome; date 
not given: "But Bossi Is an Attila; He Will Never Be Prime 
Minister"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Well, Mr. Fini, have you and 
[League Secretary] Bossi really managed to come to an agreement, 
as [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi maintains? And yet, in this 
electoral campaign, you have attacked each other day in, day 
out... 
  [Fini] My judgment has not changed. Bossi is the Attila of 
Italian politics. When we sit down around a table, the League 
will have to scale down its pretensions. And Bossi will not 
only be the one who will count less, but he will end up like the 
one who in general goes and buys the cigarettes. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And who will be prime minister? 
  [Fini] The electorate will point that out, and the president 
will appoint him. This is not a decision for party secretaries. 
One thing is certain: The prime minister can never be someone 
like Bossi. For the simple reason that a member of the League, 
an exponent of a party which is not national, cannot be prime 
minister. Strauss was the leader of Bavaria but he never dreamed 
of putting himself forward for the chancellorship. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And Berlusconi? 
  [Fini] As far as I am concerned, Berlusconi can be prime 
minister without problems. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is a government with League and MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] ministers possible? 
  [Fini] Yes, on condition that the League is clear on two 
points: a clear decision in favor of national unity and genuine 
solidarity between the north and the south. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] They too are asking you to state your 
position on federalism. Is that all right for you? 
  [Fini] What they call federalism can in our view be called 
decentralization. If this is what it is, we can discuss. If, on 
the other hand, they wish to despoil the state of all its 
skills, if they are looking for three republics, the answer is 
no. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The PPI [Italian Popular Party] maintains 
that the Pact for Italy is the only lineup that seems ready to 
govern. How do you respond to this? 
  [Fini] I too saw [PPI Venice Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi 
on television. She said they already had their program in the 
drawer. I do not find it difficult to believe her: It is the 
same one they have had for the past 40 years. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Who says that a Berlusconi-Fini-Bossi 
majority will not be quarrelsome like the old five-party system? 
  [Fini] All coalition governments are exposed to the danger 
of 
internal conflicts. The Left too had its difficulties, it seems 
to me. But what is the alternative? The single party?

<F P=106> [Interview with Radical leader Marco Pannella by Marco </F>
Stanganelli; place and date not given: "Pannella: `I Will Tell 
You Who the Real Demon Is'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stanganelli] Why are you 
running alone...? 
  [Pannella] I had asked [Italian Popular Party, PPI, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, [former 
Socialist Prime Minister] Amato, and [former Italian Liberal 
Party Secretary] Zanone to constitute a pole against the 
alliance between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National 
Alliance leader] Fini in Rome. They did not even answer. We 
made a "free" offer to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], 
Greens, and AD [Democratic Alliance] to provide "reformist" 
support against the MSI [Italian Social Movement] candidates in 
all the center-south. They did not even say no. In reality, 
they much prefer Fini who for them is not only "better than 
Berlusconi" but also better than Pannella. We have all heard 
[PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto say that he likes Fini. What 
happened between 1976 and 1979, when only half of the MSI 
candidates became part of the "national unity" will happen again 
under the new legislature. This time they will all enter with 
flying colors. 
  [Stanganelli] But was Achille Occhetto's comment not simply 
a 
gesture of electoral fair play? 
  [Pannella] Fair play! In the clash against the "demon" 
Berlusconi, they brought a well-known respected person like 
[Budget Minister] Spaventa, who is undisputably a layman, into 
the game. Instead they put an amiable Rete member, who is 
entirely innocuous against Fini. Even this is a sure sign that 
they are now officially ready for national unity as far as the 
MSI leader is concerned. Anthropological and cultural unity for 
those who were antifascists and who could not be distinguished 
from the fascists for many years. [passage omitted] 
  [Stanganelli] There is already talk of the postelection 
government. The Left is talking of Ciampi whom you supported 
some time back. What about now? 
  [Pannella] I supported the financial bills of the Ciampi and 
Amato governments with loyalty, but when the Ciampi government 
completed its task, became a branch of the progressives and 
[President] Scalfaro, and misgoverned with tens of decrees, I 
drew my conclusions. It should be remembered that the role of 
the governors of the Bank of Italy was substantially to cover up 
for the dysfunctions and the rotten nature of our economic, 
financial, and banking system. The "good" Ciampi is politically 
innocuous, disarmed, at the mercy of the existing powers who 
still want him at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] or in the seat 
of the uncomfortable Scalfaro. 
  [Stanganelli] A lot of people want to see your friend 
Scalfaro retire ahead of time. 
  [Pannella] I think that he was and remains the only 
constitutional, reasonable, and honest barrier against the 
increasingly more corrupt politics, parties, and newspapers. 
They tried, and will try to lynch him and knock him down using 
any means possible: from [LA REPUBBLICA editor] Scalfari to the 
progressives, from the red magistrates to the "moderate" press, 
from the fascists and troublemakers to the secret service. 
  [Stanganelli] Who do you consider to be most suitable head 
of 
government in Italy for the Second Republic? 
  [Pannella] Contrary to what Segni and Berlusconi seemed to 
think, the new parliament will decide who the prime minister 
will be, that is the Sunday [27 March] elections will decide. 
Foreseeably, this means the former PCI [Italian Communist 
Party], DC [Christian Democratic Party], and MSI: the actors I 
fear will ruin our country, making it worse than before, if we 
are not there. Without boasting, our possible absence -- if the 
gray card for the proportional vote is not used to guarantee our 
presence -- could risk being a heavy burden. If it was not for 
us we would have had Arnaldo Forlani [DC] or Giulio Andreotti 
[DC] at the Quirinale [president's palace] in 1992. 
  [Stanganelli] Finally Pannella, given the difficulties of 
your list, do you not think that you are running the risk of 
being expelled from parliament after almost 20 years? How will 
you face your second 60 years as a full-time, round-the-clock 
politician? 
  [Pannella] If the voters -- of the Right, Left, center, or 
whoever they may be -- do not vote for the Pannella list on the 
gray card to make us get more than 4 percent, we will no longer 
be in this republic nor in parliament. For 30 years they said 
that if it was not for us they would have had to invent us. 
They can "invent" us if they like. We are not the ones that 
should be afraid. We have, once again, opted for solitude 
because as [20th century philosopher] Benedetto Croce said, in 
the history of a country it is sometimes necessary to have men 
for whom "Paris is not worth a mass." I chose seat 24 in Rome 
and the proportional lists because if you do not take a risk you 
cannot reap the benefits of things that are worth being 
attempted. Neither for myself, nor for the others.

  [Text] Palermo, Italy, March 26 (AFP) -- The trial of Mafia 
boss Toto Riina was suspended Saturday [26 March] after five 
jurors refused to serve, sparking an immediate inquiry, judicial 
officials said. 
  A criminal court session in the Ucciardone prison in this 
Sicilian town was set to try Riina Saturday morning on charges 
of arranging the murder of Gerlando Alberti, a former member of 
the Mafia. 
  Riina and other suspected Mafia leaders are accused of 
hiring 
five men who tried to poison Alberti while he was serving a 
sentence in Ucciardone. Alberti was able to alert prison guards 
in time to save his life. 
  The prosecutor's office will question the jurors to 
determine 
the cause of their refusal. 
  It is not unusual for jurors in Italy to refuse to serve in 
Mafia trials because of potential danger to themselves or their 
families.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Extra Fish for Bornholm"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Bornholm's fishermen yesterday received 
compensation for the fish catches they would have lost as the 
result of a "technical error" during the negotiations on Swedish 
membership of the European Union [EU]. 
  It would seem that it was the Greek presidency that, in the 
nocturnal negotiations with Sweden earlier this month, made the 
mistake by forgetting to consult Denmark before Sweden was 
allowed to increase its cod quota in the Baltic Sea from 35 to 
40 percent. 
  Danish diplomatic circles reject the notion that the error 
could be on the Danish side. The Danes saw no document that 
quoted the figure of 40 percent, and they had therefore only 
approved an offer of 35 percent, the diplomats say. 
  The result of yesterday's discussions in the Council of 
Ministers was that the Council has committed itself to buying 
fishing rights in the Baltic from other countries -- the Baltic 
countries and Russia, for example -- corresponding to what has 
been lost by Bornholm's fishermen because of the concessions to 
Sweden. 
  "With this agreement we have protected Bornholm's 
fishermen's 
interests, and I view this as an important result," Foreign 
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party) said 
yesterday evening. "An error had unfortunately occurred, and I 
do not know precisely how this happened."

  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes that his 
country's membership of the European Union [EU] will become a 
reality after Finland's membership. Klaus, who is visiting 
Finland, has held talks with political leaders about Finland's 
attitude toward the EU, among other things. On the basis of 
these talks, Prime Minister Klaus described Finland's attitude 
toward EU membership as an investment. 
  [Begin Klaus recording, in English] Finland definitely 
discovered that EC membership, this is now my terminology and 
not the terminology of the Finnish prime minister or anybody 
else, that EC membership is an investment. [end recording] 
  Klaus said that EU membership is not a miraculous cure but 
an 
investment that has its costs and its benefits. Positive and 
negative sides might appear at different stages and influence 
different parts of society in different ways, the Czech prime 
minister said.

<F P=106> [Bjarne Nitovuori report: "EU Referendum To Be Held in </F>
November?"] 
  [Excerpt] The referendum on Finland's EU [European Union] 
membership could be arranged for 13 November, Father's Day -- 
the same day that Sweden is arranging its referendum. 
  This idea surfaced in an interview with Prime Minister Esko 
Aho (Center Party) in Center Party newspaper LALLI yesterday. 
  It was not Aho but the interviewer who brought up the idea, 
and Aho replied that this is an alternative that has not been 
ruled out. 
  "I have argued for an earlier date. Here I have been 
thinking chiefly about September, but now the delay with the 
decisions means that serious consideration is also being given 
to a later date." 
  However, according to Aho, 13 November is the latest 
possible 
date, otherwise we will be much too close to the Eduskunta 
election. This takes place in March next year. 
  Aho also thinks that a shared referendum day for Finland and 
Sweden -- "and why not Norway too" -- would underline the fact 
that the Nordic countries are in the same position and their 
decisions are interdependent. 
  According to Aho, this would also have the positive effect 
of 
ruling out the domino effect -- so that the referendum result in 
one country will not influence public opinion in another where 
the referendum is held at a later date. 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) yesterday 
told agricultural journalists that he would prefer a referendum 
after the Swedish poll -- that is, after a date which, according 
to Aho, is the "last possible date." [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to the latest opinion poll, support for 
the Social Democratic Party [SDP] has risen to a record-high 
level during this election period. In an opinion poll carried 
out by Finnish Gallup for HELSINGIN SANOMAT, support for the SDP 
is about 34 percent. Support for the party is 12 percent higher 
than the number of votes it received in the last parliamentary 
elections. According to the opinion poll, the main government 
parties -- the National Coalition Party and the Center Party -- 
would both receive support of just under 18 percent. Joint 
support for the four government parties is now 43 percent. The 
opposition thus has a clear majority of support from the voters. 
Support for the Leftist Alliance was 11 percent, and support for 
the Greens has dropped to 6 percent. Support for the Finnish 
Rural Party has dropped to almost nothing. Last week, 2,000 
Finns were interviewed for the opinion poll.

<F P=106> [Hilde Harbo report: "Natural To Vote After Sweden"] </F>
  [Text] Stavanger -- The government is paving the way for a 
Norwegian referendum after the vote in Sweden. "That is what is 
natural," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said. 
  If it is at all possible, she will this week call a meeting 
of party leaders and representatives of No to the EU and of the 
Europe Movement to discuss the matter. 
  "I will of course listen to what they have to say about the 
date for a Norwegian referendum. But for me it is natural that 
our referendum should come after the referendum Sweden will hold 
on 13 November." 
  Brundtland pointed to the fact that the government has long 
held the view that the referendum should be held around six 
months after the membership agreement is finalized and has been 
debated by the European Parliament. Strasbourg's scrutiny of 
the agreement is planned to be complete by 4 May. 
  What is most likely is that the Norwegian referendum will 
come one or at most two weeks after the Swedish referendum. A 
later date would be difficult if the timetable of Norwegian 
membership from 1 January 1995 is to be met, because the 
Storting needs time for the necessary ratification of the 
agreement after the referendum has been held. 
  Brundtland justified her view of the order of the 
referendums 
with the argument that Norway applied for membership after 
Sweden and Finland, and that the decision for a Norwegian 
membership application was to a large extent reached as a result 
of the fact that Norway's two Nordic neighbors had applied for 
membership. She therefore takes the view that it is natural for 
Norwegian voters also to know the outcome of the referendums in 
the other Nordic applicant countries before they make up their 
minds about Norwegian membership. Finland will probably hold 
its referendum in September. 
  The annual general meeting of the Rogaland Labor Party did 
not reach any decision about a date for a referendum, while the 
Hordaland Labor Party yesterday voted to back a referendum after 
the Swedes and the Finns have voted. Hordaland Labor Party 
attaches importance to the significance the result in Sweden 
will have for many Norwegian voters. 
  After the prime minister has heard the views of parties and 
organizations on the date for a referendum, the government will 
be swift to recommend a date. The prime minister announced that 
this recommendation will be made public before the draft bill 
for a referendum is completed. This will be submitted to the 
Storting in the course of its spring session. The government 
already has a majority in the Storting backing the proposal for 
a Norwegian referendum after the Swedish referendum. 
  The prime minister told the annual general meeting of the 
Rogaland Labor Party yesterday about how she herself overcame 
her doubts and said yes in 1972 [year of Norway's previous 
referendum on EC/EU membership]. She reached her final decision 
at a gathering at which each of the guests had to outline their 
views. 
  "One of the contributions made a strong impression on me and 
finally helped me to reach a decision. The person in question 
said that he was against membership, because otherwise we could 
run the risk of bumping into Germans and Italians when hiking on 
the Hardanger mountain plateau. Then I realized that I would 
have to think about the future, about the fact that we also have 
to embrace people from other countries, and that you cannot 
simply build socialism Norwegian-style. The Nordic countries 
must make their contribution when it comes to creating peace and 
security in Europe. In the next round it is the former 
communist countries in East Europe that are knocking on the door 
to ensure a better future for their children," Brundtland said. 
  In the same way that her doubts finally ended in a yes in 
1972, several central elected officials in Rogaland Labor Party 
have now overcome their doubts and are saying their yes to 
Norwegian membership. The majority in favor of Norwegian 
membership is now very solid in this local party. It is hinted 
that around 80 percent of those taking part in the annual 
general meeting have ended up in the yes camp. 
  For those who are still in doubt and who fear for the future 
if EU policy were to change and come into conflict with 
Norwegian interests, the prime minister had the following 
comfort: 
  "If we get into a situation in which we no longer feel 
welcome in the EU, we can say `Thank you and good-bye.' If 
there are attempts by the rest of the Union to steamroller 
central national interests -- something that in principle cannot 
happen under the terms of the agreement that has now been 
entered into at the highest political level -- there can be no 
doubt that we will reach our own conclusions. The EU is an 
association of independent nations. It makes no difference what 
the other countries do. It is the Norwegian Storting that in 
the final analysis decides whether we enter the EU -- or leave 
it."

<F P=106> [Ole Johan Nilsen report: "EU Questions One After Another"] </F>
  [Text] "No question time without EU [European Union] 
questions" looks to be the motto in the Storting these days. 
The foreign purchase of Norwegian fishing boats and their 
quotas was the topic for Morten Lund (Center Party). Fisheries 
Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen pointed out that the EU agreement 
prevents such purchases for three years. It will also be 
possible to retain Norwegian rules that stipulate that only 
those actively engaged in fishing can own fishing boats. 
Finally, licensing regulations and considerations of resources 
and regional policy can be invoked. The minister gave advance 
notice of his own law covering the right to engage in fishing. 
  Syver Berge (Center Party) wanted more information about the 
agricultural agreement. [Agriculture Minister] Gunhild Oyangen 
pointed out that some questions need to be clarified, including 
those to do with the food industry, environmental programs for 
primary agriculture, and investment arrangements. Clarification 
is also needed on the boundaries of the northern agricultural 
support area. She expects that there will be an agreement 
containing the necessary clarifications before the referendum. 
  Differentiated employers' contributions need to be 
clarified, 
but there is every indication that we can keep our present 
arrangement, Municipal Affairs and Labor Minister Gunnar Berge 
told Eilef A. Meland (Socialist Left Party). The results of the 
talks with the EU on this matter will be available in a few 
weeks. 
  Paul Chaffey (Socialist Left Party) sought guarantees from 
the EU in areas affecting asbestos, CFC gases, solvents, and 
mercury. Thorbjorn Berntsen responded that our rules on CFC's 
are not in conflict with the EU's rules. We can also keep our 
ban on the import and manufacture of asbestos. We can keep our 
regulations covering the labeling of solvents, but Norwegian 
regulations covering mercury in batteries can only remain in 
force for four years. But in this area there is an agreement 
committing the EU to revising its rules. In some areas Norway 
will have to tighten up its environmental regulations. This 
applies, for example, to the substance pentachlorophenol. 
  Chaffey also wanted information about "EEA [European 
Economic 
Area] fish" that had been handed over to the EU in the 
negotiations. The minister informed him that the pattern of 
fisheries that would have been set up in 1997 has been brought 
forward to 1995 with slightly larger quantities than applied 
after the EEA agreement. 
  Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa (Center Party) raised the question 
of duty-free alcohol allowances within the EU. Social Affairs 
Minister Hill-Marta Solberg was able to announce that the 
government has no plans for a comprehensive reorganization of 
Norwegian alcohol policy. Vinmonopolet [state alcohol monopoly] 
will continue as it is today, import allowances will be 
maintained with small additional quantities bought at full 
price, the advertising ban will continue, and the duties on 
alcohol will continue to be fixed by Norway. But border checks 
will be more difficult to carry out, she thought. 
  Arvid Vegger (Center Party) wondered whether the EU 
agreement 
is binding in international law. The trade minister replied 
that before it is binding the parliaments of the various 
countries involved must have ratified it. However, first it 
must be scrutinized by the European Parliament and then signed.

<F P=106> [Article by Eirik Ramberg: "Conservatives Want Stricter </F>
Asylum Measures" -- introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Excerpt] The Conservatives feel that Norway should 
tighten its policy towards those who seek asylum on its 
shores. 
  Many of the asylum-seekers coming to Norway are actually 
economic refugees. These should not be allowed to take the 
places of other refugees who really need them. Norway should not 
take in fewer refugees, but more of those Norway does admit 
should be on the UN High Commissioner's refugee list. "These are 
the ones who need asylum most," said Anders C. Sjaastad 
(Conservative), vice chairman of the Justice Committee in the 
Storting. 
<H5>  Supports Approval </H5>
  The Storting will discuss refugee policy at today's session. 
The government made three statements concerning the situation 
last week. The groundwork for today's debate was laid by 
presentations on government policy made by Foreign Minister 
Bjorn Tore Godal, Districts Minister Gunnar Berge, and Justice 
Minister Grete Faremo. 
  The Labor Party, the Conservatives, and Progress Party will 
ensure that a quorum is present in the Storting for the 
government resolution that will open the way for sending Kosovo 
Albanians back to their homeland and make visas obligatory for 
Bosnians. Today's debate will take the form of a preliminary 
exchange of ideas on a comprehensive refugee policy. Only after 
the government has presented its report to the Storting can a 
set of guidelines be formulated on the issues of temporary 
residence for refugees and the right to asylum. 
<H5>  Integration? </H5>
  Sjaastad, the Conservative spokesman on justice issues, 
favored the principle of temporary residence for refugees 
provided that they return to their homeland as soon as it is 
feasible to do so. 
  "It is clear enough that the question of integration into 
Norwegian society will be difficult. Refugees need to have the 
opportunity to adapt to daily life in Norway. But long-term 
undertakings such as job training or extensive education should 
be looked at more closely in terms of appropriateness," Sjaastad 
told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  He stressed that one must meet the challenge of an 
increasing 
number of refugees "with a somewhat open mind." 
  "We are dealing with people. It is important that attention 
be paid to individual needs," Sjaastad said. 
<H5>  Dividing Line </H5>
  The political dividing line in refugee policy, at least in 
the concrete issues of visa requirements for Bosnians and the 
return of the Kosovo Albanians, corresponds to the EU [European 
Union] division. Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa, the Center Party 
second in command and the leader of the parliamentary delegation 
to Kosovo, felt that the government was undermining the right to 
asylum. Lisbeth Holand (Socialist Left Party), spokesman for the 
Justice Committee, concurred and Kjell Mange Bondevik, chairman 
of the Christian Party, said the Kosovo Albanians must be 
accorded temporary residence in Norway on the same footing as 
the Bosnians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Tom Hansson report: "Crisis Near for EU Timetable"] </F>
  [Text] The way is open for the European Parliament's 
approval of the Swedish accession agreement. If only the EU 
[European Union] can solve its internal problems. 
  This was European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel's 
pronouncement to yesterday's press briefing and these "internal 
affairs" also came to be the main theme of the briefing. 
  "The situation within the EU is serious. If it is not 
resolved soon, there will be every justification for talk of a 
crisis. Something that could in its turn deadlock the European 
Parliament." 
  Soon -- perhaps at this coming weekend's meeting of foreign 
ministers. But certainly not as late as the summer's meeting of 
foreign ministers on Corfu. Even though Dinkelspiel says that 
he does not see how the issue can be resolved. 
  "As far as I am able to judge there is no definite deadline. 
Technically it will be possible to carry on a good way into 
April." 
  The Swedish side is currently working on the treaty of 
accession. It is expected that this will be translated and put 
before the European Parliament "in early April." 
  "But the parliament already has a base on which to begin its 
work and it has done so," the European affairs minister said. 
  However, he declined to make any statement himself about the 
distribution of votes in the European Parliament [sentence as 
published]. Something that Social Democratic opposition leader 
Ingvar Carlsson, for example, has done. 
  "The question is of some importance, but not of such 
importance that I think it justified. Thus we have therefore, 
quite intentionally, not decided on a position." 
  As a nonmember Sweden is still a mere spectator of the 
ongoing debacle between Spain and Britain and the rest of the 
EU. What Sweden is doing is "following" what is being said in 
Brussels, London, and Madrid. Further negotiations are not 
being contemplated. 
  "But we have of course close contacts with the countries. 
But we always have, with everybody." 
  But does the current conflict in Brussels not help to 
strengthen the no side here at home? 
  "It could have a temporary influence on public opinion. But 
if there is a serious crisis, it could have more lasting 
negative repercussions." 
  But Dinkelspiel was unwilling to agree -- not fully at least 
-- to the suggestion that the Swedish Government already knows 
what the final outcome will be, that everything has really 
already been settled. 
  "The negotiations are incomplete. But it would of course not 
be wholly truthful of me to say that I do not know in what 
direction things are leaning." 
  So it is now fully in order for the European affairs 
minister 
to go to South Africa on Thursday [24 March]. At the head of 
the first Swedish trade delegation to visit the country since 
sanctions were lifted. And let Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas deal with Europe over the next 10 days.

  [Text] Paris, March 28 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur on Monday [28 March] suspended a controversial plan to 
pay young people less than the minimum legal wage, government 
spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said. 
  Balladur suspended the plan for a week at a meeting with 
youth leaders on Monday. 
  Sarkozy said the government would organise a conference, 
which he called "a youth states-general," to restore dialogue. 
  A ministerial committee consisting of Education Minister 
Francois Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon and 
Youth and Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, would organise 
the conference, Sarkozy said. 
  He also said that Michel Bon, director-general of the 
national employment agency ANPE had been charged by Balladur to 
set up "a job-seeking system" for youths. 
  A youth leader walked out of the meeting because Balladur 
did 
not withdraw the jobs plan completely. 
  Cecile Amar, of the high school students' federation FIDL, 
said she also walked out because Balladur said he did not have 
the authority to grant two other demands. 
  These were that court cases against student demonstrators be 
dropped and two Algerians who were deported last week for 
alleged theft and throwing stones at police during a rally in 
Lyon, eastern France, be brought back. 
  Amar said a planned national demonstration next Thursday 
would still go ahead. 
  Also in the youth delegation was Philippe Campinchi, 
president of the pro-socialist UNEF-ID students union, and Bob 
Injey, leader of the pro-communist UNEF. Ad hoc groups 
coordinating the protest campaign in technical universities and 
nationally were represented by Helene Joubert and Christophe 
Hode. 
  Speaking on Sunday after claiming victory for his 
conservative coalition in local elections, Balladur had pledged 
to move "to re-establish dialogue" over his jobs plan, following 
a month of sometimes violent protests by students and trade 
unions. 
  Balladur said that the plan had only been a government 
attempt to fight unemployment, but it had been "interpreted as 
showing a lack of attention" towards young people. 
  "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the 
government," 
he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people." 
  Balladur said said it was "the duty of society to offer 
young 
people a future. And for this we should start by 
re-establishing dialogue with them and examine the various 
possible solutions." 
  With Balladur were Labour Minister Michel Giraud as well as 
Sarkozy. 
  Under the jobs plan, aimed at reducing unemployment, young 
people under 25 with diplomas or university degrees were to have 
been paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of 
working time, the remaining time being spent on training. 
  Unqualified youths would be paid 20 percent less than the 
minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. [passage

  [Text] Paris, March 25 (AFP) -- Heavily-armed riot police 
clashed with youngsters in the French capital Friday [25 March] 
when tens of thousands of students marched to demand the 
withdrawal of a government cut-price jobs plan for young people. 
  Several hundred youths outside the peaceful main body of the 
march threw rocks and stones at police who retaliated with baton 
charges, making a number of arrests. Five officers were injured. 
  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua called in 3,300 riot police 
after predicting there would be "1,000 trouble-makers" hidden 
among the peaceful protestors. 
  Thousands of young people also turned out in provincial 
cities across the country, after serious unrest in the western 
cities of Nantes and Rennes overnight. 
  In Lyon, eastern France, about 10,000 young people rallied, 
there were 4,000 at Besancon and 2,000 at Perpignan in the 
south-west. 
  In Nantes another demonstration began Friday after clashes 
overnight between hundreds of student militants and police for 
the third time in a week. Thirty police, a television cameraman 
and at least two demonstrators were injured, authorities said. 
Twenty-two arrests were made. 
  In Rennes, youths hurled rocks and bottles at police who 
riposted with tear gas for two hours early on Friday. Six 
police and one youth were injured and 11 people were arrested. 
  In Paris, students organised their own system of guards to 
prevent vandalism and fighting. Shopkeepers rolled down their 
steel shutters and the authorities closed down metro stations on 
the route. 
  A group of 50 "white helmets" were there to monitor police 
behaviour and the way any arrests were made, a spokesman said. 
The group was wearing white caps. 
  Student anger over the government plan has been heightened 
by 
uncertainty about their future in a country that has 3.3 million 
unemployed -- almost 12 percent of the work force -- of whom 
more than 750,000 are under 25. 
  The plan states that young people with diplomas or 
university 
degrees may be paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 
percent of working time, with 20 percent of training. 
  Students called the plan a poor reward for years of study 
and 
trade unionists denounced it as opening the way to firing older 
workers and replacing them with poorly-paid youths.

  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- French voters cast ballots 
Sunday [27 March] in second-round local elections expected to 
confirm a slight recovery by the beleaguered Socialists as well 
as a consolidation by the ruling center-right coalition. 
  In the first round last Sunday, the two parties in Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition and their allies garnered 
44.59 percent of the votes, the same score as in March 1993 
general elections in which they trounced the then-ruling 
Socialist Party. 
  The Socialists made a respectable showing last weekend, 
taking more than 22 percent of the votes compared to 17.59 in 
the disastrous legislative election. 
  Up for grabs in the second round run-offs were 1,372 
councillors' posts in France's 95 departments. 
  Only about a third of the races had clear-cut winners in the 
first round. 
  The election is also Balladur's first national-level test 
since he came to power a year ago. He is widely believed to 
have presidential aspirations. President Francois Mitterrand's 
term ends in May of next year. 
  Turnout as of 5:00 p.m. [1500 GMT] was about 48 percent, 
down 
slightly from last Sunday, the Interior Ministry said. 
  Polls closed at 6:00 p.m. [1600 GMT] in most areas, except 
in 
large cities, where they were to remain open an extra two hours. 
  The voting comes after a week of angry and sometimes violent 
demonstrations by students opposed to a government plan to fight 
record unemployment by letting businesses pay young people a 
lower minimum wage. 
  Political analysts said the effect of the demonstrations at 
the ballot box was hard to predict. 
  The occasional outbursts of violence by the students might 
translate into support for the government and its efforts to 
fight crime, the analysts said. But at the same time, the 
students' opposition to the government employment plan might be 
reflected in the electorate as a whole, the analysts added. 
  In any case the election is not expected to cause any major 
shift in the balance of power on the local level. 
  Right-wing parties currently control 75 of the country's 95 
departments, compared to 12 for the socialists, six for their 
left-wing allies and two for the communists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by </F>
announcer Etienne Leenhardt and journalist Albert Du Roy -- live] 
  [Text] [Leenhardt] In spite of the fact that it is quite 
late, we are live with the interior minister, who is still at 
the ministry. Good evening Mr. Pasqua. 
  [Pasqua] Good evening. 
  [Leenhardt] Mr. Pasqua, you were delighted after the first 
round of the cantonal elections. Are you as happy this evening? 
  [Pasqua] Listen, the election results must be taken as they 
come. One can see that the parliamentary majority has had good 
results. As far as seats go, the votes were better distributed 
among the Left than within the parliamentary majority. Besides, 
the candidates of the National Front prevented the winning of 
some seats. Therefore, as we said earlier on, there has been a 
change in the majority in some departments. 
  [Leenhardt] Albert Du Roy. 
  [Du Roy] Yes. Charles Pasqua, you hoped -- the majority 
hoped -- to get a victory in more departments than is the case. 
How do you explain ... 
  [Pasqua, interrupting] Mr. Du Roy, you know in how many 
general/councils we already have a majority, don't you? 
  [Du Roy] 75? 
  [Pasqua] Yes. Listen, we are in a democracy. One cannot 
hope to have 100. Besides, it is obvious that it would have 
been attempting the impossible to think that the Socialist Party 
would disappear in some departments where it has been deeply 
rooted for a long time. We are not the ones who said that we 
hoped to win such or such a department. The observers did. Of 
course, we would be happy if we had won them. 
  [Du Roy] The second round took place today. For you, is this 
vote mainly local or national? 
  [Pasqua] I believe that it is first and foremost a local 
vote, but one cannot ignore its national aspect. I am not 
giving you a noncommittal answer, I am only saying that it is 
obvious that the cantonal elections are first and foremost local 
elections. Some of this evening's results confirm this. 
Moreover, mobilization has been more successful with left-wing 
voters, insofar as they have heard and heard again that the 
majority was threatened in some departments. This is why they 
mobilized more. I would like people to see things as they are. 
This evening, as far as seats are concerned -- although we do 
not have all the results, since we are still without the results 
in 32 cantons -- may I say that the great victors are the 
parties close to the majority and those close to the opposition. 
  [Du Roy] Let us now go beyond the cantonal elections. 
Earlier on, the chairman of the French Democratic Union, Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing, said that one of the messages of the vote was 
that the government had to speed up reforms. Do you agree with 
him? 
  [Pasqua] Yes. However, for the government to speed up 
reforms, it would be necessary for those who -- or at least, 
this is what I think -- support the government to do so and to 
leave it to its work. 
  [Leenhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Pasqua. You were 
speaking live from the Interior Ministry.

  [Text] Marseille, France, March 28 (AFP) -- Bernard Tapie, 
the flamboyant politician and businessman who owns the Olympique 
Marseille football team, has been indicted in connection with 
fraud in the club's accounts, officials revealed Monday [28 
March]. 
  The officials, who spoke after Tapie's stunning victory 
Sunday in a local election with 67.88 percent of the vote, did 
not reveal the exact charges, but said examining magistrate 
Pierre Philippon discretely indicted Tapie on March 10. 
  It was Tapie's third indictment. 
  Officials at the public prosecutor's office said Philippon 
was probing alleged "forgery and embezzlement" in the club's 
accounts after then Justice Minister Michel Vauzelle in 1992 
ordered an investigation into nine French clubs, including 
Marseille. 
  Tapie, 50, was charged last month with bribery and 
interfering with witnesses involved in attempts to pay three 
Valenciennes players to throw a game against Marseille last May 
20. 
  On December 22, he was charged with embezzlement at Bethune, 
northern France, in a case involving the Testut weighing machine 
firm in his business empire. 
  Tapie, urban affairs minister in the socialist government 
ousted last month, swept to victory in a former communist-held 
constituency over far-right National Front candidate 
Marie-Claude Rossignol. She received 32.13 percent of the vote. 
  Tapie, who is also Marseille MP for the Radical Left, an 
ally 
of the Socialist Party, said after the first round of voting on 
March 20 that he was now aiming for the mayoralty of France's 
third largest city in municipal elections in 1995. He also 
plans to head the Radical Left list in the European elections in 
June. 
  Earlier this month, Tapie reached an accord with the 
state-owned loss-making Credit Lyonnais bank to write off his 
debts and to sell off all his business interests in his empire, 
Bernard Tapie-France, with a mortgage on his personal fortune. 
  The risk for the bank could be up to 500 million francs 
(84.8 
million dollars). Right-wing MP Philippe de Villiers called for 
an inquiry into the debt write-off. 
  Before the Valenciennes scandal, Marseille won the French 
championship for the fifth consecutive year and on May 26 its 
fortunes were at their zenith when Marseille beat A.C. Milan to 
win the European Cup, becoming the first French club to do so. 
  On September 6, football's governing body in Europe, UEFA, 
barred Marseille from the European Cup.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Fleury: "Edouard Balladur One Year </F>
After His Appointment as Head of State: `I Have Not 
Changed...'"] 
  [Text] "I have not changed. I have set my course and I 
will not be diverted from it. My goal is that after two years 
here in the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], France 
should be doing better. The record of this first year shows 
many improvements." 
  Edouard Balladur has published the record of his first year 
in government a few days ahead of schedule -- he was asked to 
form the government on 29 March 1993. It is a document of 
around 100 pages which, with the help of graphs, reviews in 
detail all the issues tackled during this first year of change 
and takes stock of the results obtained. It is a generally 
positive record and one which is very encouraging for the 
majority and the head of government. 
  Its publication on the eve of the second round of the 
cantonal elections is no accident. Although the Matignon denies 
turning this election, which is expected to reinforce the 
majority, into a test of approval of the government's policies, 
this early presentation will certainly prompt some gnashing of 
teeth within the majority and criticisms from the opposition. 
But the Matignon is calm. According to the prime minister's 
entourage, he has never tried to turn the cantonal elections 
into a test of his popularity. "It is not he who has said that 
this election would make it possible to assess the popularity of 
Balladur's policy. But since it has been turned into a test, it 
must be admitted that it is not bad for him. He will not 
complain!" 
  He is complaining still less because the situation in France 
after the initial 12 months of his term of office is improving. 
Although the economic indicators are still flashing dangerously, 
they show real progress and make it possible to predict a 
resumption of growth for the end of the year. The institutes 
are unanimous in forecasting growth of 2 percent in December 
compared with negative growth (minus 1 percent) in March 1993. 
  "When we came to power," the prime minister points out, "we 
found a situation characterized by recession, unemployment, an 
increased deficit in the budget and social security fund, a lack 
of growth, and a moral crisis" which had plunged the country 
into deep pessimism. The government has set to work in a 
five-year timeframe, and deliberately ignored the presidential 
election. Indeed, Balladur notes, the main problems which the 
government encountered involved the stagnation of society and 
the upcoming presidential election rather than with 
cohabitation. Moreover, this cohabitation has always gone well 
and has in no way hampered the government's work. 
  Balladur's main concern was therefore to extricate himself 
as 
much as possible from the stranglehold of the preparations for 
the presidential election, although the Matignon points out that 
history contains many prime ministers who crossed the Seine 
[from the Matignon to the Elysee presidential office]. His 
second concern was of a pedagogical kind: Not imposing reforms 
on the French people but explaining them in advance to ensure 
their acceptance. Was that the right method? "I wonder," he 
said, "whether I was wrong or right to place the emphasis on the 
difficulty of carrying out reforms." Because, by raising the 
question, you generate debate and raise problems which go beyond 
the issue at hand. 
  The prime minister is nonetheless categorical: The 
government could not move more rapidly. The situation was worse 
than expected. "We found a fragile and worried society. We had 
to do things gradually, with as much consultation as possible," 
which led to "some criticisms" about lack of government action. 
Remembering the past 12 months, Edouard Balladur remarked 
without bitterness: "I have sometimes felt loneliness." 
  But the preliminary results are in. They are encouraging 
with regard to the main parameters of government action -- 
unemployment, budget control, the restoration of the social 
security fund, foreign trade, and security. 
  -- Unemployment: The increase in the number of people 
seeking work is slowing down. It was 20,000 in the last three 
months of 1993 compared with 80,000 registered in the last three 
months of the Beregovoy government. It is a slowing down which 
is full of promise and reflects the first effects of the 
government measures. The prime minister, who refuses to engage 
in a quarrel over statistics, refutes the criticisms which blame 
him for the increase in unemployment from March to September 
1993. "The measures which we took as soon as we came to office 
could not have had an effect before September." It was from 
then that an improvement was recorded. "I do not see how we 
could be held responsible" for the continued rise in 
unemployment between April and September "when the measures 
taken could not have immediate effects." 
  -- Control of the state budget: The situation was not 
hopeful when the transition [of government] took place. The 
"budget deficit" was estimated at 343 billion francs [Fr]. The 
five-year law adopted by the new government were expected to 
reduce the deficit to Fr317.6 billion. The austerity measures 
which were taken made it possible to improve that forecast. The 
settlement of the budget resulted in a deficit of Fr315.7 
billion. The government, whose objective is to reduce this 
deficit to Fr200 billion in 1997 (2.5 percent of GDP), notes 
with satisfaction that this initial result exceeds expectations. 
  -- Social security: The balance has been maintained even if 
it meant increasing the CSG [General Social Contribution] by 1 
percent. Edouard Balladur makes no secret of the fact that the 
problem of social security funding remains worrying. By the end 
of the century, the whole system of the organization and funding 
will have to be reviewed in accordance with the world economic 
situation. He is categorical: "We will not accept a leveling 
down." 
  -- Foreign trade: As soon as it came to office, the 
government was faced with the GATT negotiations. It faced 
American demands and European hesitations with great 
determination and imposed a fair compromise. 
  -- Security: The functioning of justice has been improved, 
the fight against crime has been given new resources. Together 
with a more stringent limitation of immigration, this issue was 
one of the French people's priorities. 
  "We were elected to ensure that the state regained full 
control. We have done a great deal, but a great deal remains to 
be done," Edouard Balladur reaffirmed. Without dwelling too 
much on his positive record, he lists the main stages of 1994 in 
terms of a continuation of reforms which will take up all of 
Parliament's work: new measures for employment; reform of family 
allowances; reorganization of social security; the police; 
justice; the overseas departments; fiscal reform; the military 
programming law; the law on decentralization and regional 
development. "We are tackling all the major issues which 
concern France between now and the end of the century." With 
the desire to develop and increase solidarity "to ensure that 
nobody is left out." 
  One subject concerns the prime minister particularly. He 
does not understand the obstinacy of high school and university 
students in demonstrating against a so-called "youth minimum 
wage" which "I would never accept." The provisions of the CIP 
[job training contracts], although they were originally not well 
drafted, are "not directed against young people. Our only 
concern is to help young people find a first job, to find 
something other than the ANPE [National Employment Agency] when 
they leave the school system." It is not natural for us to beat 
records for youth unemployment in Europe. Why should a system 
that has proven its efficiency elsewhere not be feasible in 
France? The prime minister's entourage, more incisive than him 
on this point, referred to a degree of manipulation of young 
people, a kind of protest organization to generate a social 
explosion. "We have been predicting problems for a year. 
Social explosion has become a fashionable subject. By talking 
about it, you give people ideas." 
  For Edouard Balladur these demonstrations "reveal the deep 
disquiet which affects young people," lost between a society 
ruled by old regulations and technical progress which calls all 
values into question. This disquiet also affects the whole of 
society. "We must take more account of the world's development. 
The (economic) emergence of the developing countries means that 
the countries of Western Europe face a risk of being pushed to 
the fringes." Reforms are therefore necessary to ensure that we 
adapt and enter the new millennium in good condition. "It will 
take us a good 10 years of adaptation." But, fortunately, if 
growth picks up again, society will look to the future more 
calmly.

  [Text] EU [European Union] Commissioner on Foreign Affairs 
Hans Van Den Broek said that during his visit to Cyprus he 
reconfirmed his impression of the last few months about the 
Cyprus Government's firm belief in the effort to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the Cyprus issue, as well as its effort to 
harmonize, in any way, its economic and trade policy with the 
European Union's policy. Speaking at Larnaca Airport shortly 
before his departure for Athens, Van Den Broek again expressed 
the European Union's multiple support for the 
confidence-building measures, which he said are an important 
step toward the achievement of an overall solution to the Cyprus 
issue. The EU commissioner added that he has assured both 
President Glavkos Kliridhis and Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis that in case the confidence-building measures are 
implemented, the European Union is ready to offer any help and 
the EU commission will proceed in that direction with the 
presentation of proposals to the EU Council of Ministers. 
  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that Cyprus' movement 
toward Europe has began and will end with its accession to the 
European Union. Speaking at Larnaca Airport shortly before Van 
Den Broek's departure, the foreign minister stressed that Cyprus 
is working hard for its accession and has already proceeded with 
a series of decisions in this direction. Mikhailidhis said that 
the harmonization of Cypriot legislation with that of the 
European Union continues at a quick pace. He added that Cyprus' 
foreign policy will also begin to be in line with that of the 
European Union. Referring to the talks he had with EU 
Commissioner Van Den Broek, the Cypriot foreign minister 
described them as constructive and comprehensive.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Clinton's Satisfaction"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. President's purposeless intervention 
expressing satisfaction for the course of the Cyprus problem 
causes surprise. Clinton's letter to Tansu Ciller came when 
there was a deadlock on the Cyprus issue, when Turkish 
intransigence had once again torpedoed the talks. This is why 
it causes surprise but also gives rise to deep thought about the 
U.S. President's position. How is it possible, at the time of 
the unofficial failure, for Turkey to be 
praised--indirectly--because there has allegedly been progress 
on the Cyprus issue? How is it possible that Mr. Clinton, who 
declares his interest and pledges personal intervention, does 
not know that not only is there lack of progress but even 
regression? It has been quite some time since Turkey has been 
considered the occupation force, the country that violates 
internationally recognized principles and rights. It has been 
quite some time since Turkey disassociated itself from the 
Cyprus problem and every time it becomes implicated in the 
problem it merely refers to the two communities. Ankara's 
systematic policy of complete disassociation from the problem 
has borne fruit and proof of this is the allegedly good 
intentions that many circles see on the part of Turkey. 
  However, to be sincere and realistic, this has not happened 
behind our backs, it has happened with our own tolerance if not 
with our indirect promotion. When the one who is directly 
concerned accepts Ankara's disassociation, when he accepts the 
downgrading of the problem to a bicommunal conflict, when he 
calls upon Turkey to persuade Rauf Denktas to cooperate, no 
foreigner would intervene in a contradictory way, especially 
when the foreigner's interests coincide with those of Ankara. 
That is why, along with the disappointment caused by such 
international moves as the content of Clinton's letter, it would 
be right to look for our own responsibilities, too. In the last 
analysis, the foreigners follow their own policy. We, what do 
we do? Do we compromise with it so that we do not feel 
"isolated" or do we demand what belongs to us? No support is 
given to people who do not struggle and, unfortunately, this is 
what happens in the case of Cyprus.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said that Cyprus has 
taken the initiative for the first time by promoting Cyprus' 
accession to the European Union [EU], the unified Greece-Cyprus 
defense doctrine, and the Greek Cypriot side's irreproachable 
stand at the proximity talks. On the contrary, he added, Turkey 
and Rauf Denktas are struggling to escape from the suffocating 
encirclement being created around them. 
  In an address at the Lions Club in Paralimni, President 
Kliridhis noted that the Turkish side now opposes the 
suggestions by the UN Secretary General and his representatives 
for the implementation of the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] on Famagusta. He further said that in January 1995 
Cyprus will open talks with the EU for accession to it whether 
or not there is progress in the Cyprus issue because of Turkish 
intransigence. He also noted that the accession talks will 
concern the whole of the Republic of Cyprus. President 
Kliridhis is heading for accession to the EU. He added: The 
road to accession has opened because the Greek Cypriot side's 
behavior toward the CBM's has been irreproachable; this is 
affirmed by the five permanent members of the Security Council. 
  Mr. Kliridhis said that at the proximity talks the Turkish 
side did not accept the UN suggestion that the Famagusta area 
between the sea and Dherinia, including the road, be abandoned 
by Turkish troops and placed under UN control so that there will 
be safe access to and from Famagusta. He added that the Turks 
did not accept UN administration of the town and demanded a 
trilateral administration with the participation of Greek 
Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, and some presence of the 
international organization. Mr. Kliridhis further noted that 
the Turks also did not accept the schedule for handing over the 
town or a series of other UN suggestions.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has reiterated that he is 
opposed to any changes in the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] that favor the Greek Cypriots. We will not accept the 
addition of new elements to the CBM's just to satisfy the Greek 
Cypriots, he stressed, adding that the Turkish Cypriots expect 
the promises made in the first parameters to be brought to life. 
The negotiations can continue only with this understanding, he 
added. 
  In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] on the 
latest political developments, President Denktas pointed out 
that Greek Cypriot propagandists and sympathizers began to 
mislead the world about the CBM's. The aim, he stressed, is to 
influence the UN Security Council to pass an anti-Turkish 
Cypriot resolution. 
  Denktas said: The Greek Cypriots try to make it look as if 
we got the close to 20 changes we asked for and now have the 
gall to insist on a couple of remaining points. This is not 
true. 
  The president stressed that the Turkish Cypriots expect the 
parameters cited in the UN secretary general's reports and 
affirmed by the experts' reports to be maintained, and the 
rights and powers promised to the Turkish Cypriot side be 
brought to life. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is opposed 
to any changes in the CBM's in favor of the Greek Cypriots. We 
will not agree to the addition of new elements to the CBM's just 
to satisfy the Greek Cypriots. 
  Denktas explained that while the Turkish Cypriots were 
waiting for the advantages cited in the first parameters to be 
brought to life, they were told that the Greek Cypriot side does 
not agree to this or that point or that they cannot be forced to 
accept this or that point. In this way, he said, no efforts 
were made to bring to life the rights of the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas charged that even such proposals as allowing the 
Turkish Cypriots to work in Maras [Varosha] went up in smoke. 
He added: If the promises made in the first parameters are 
properly assessed, it will become clear that the Turkish 
Cypriots were not given 20 additional rights, as is being 
alleged. 
  Denktas said that the negotiations can continue only with 
this understanding. It is not we who are creating difficulties 
in the negotiations, he said, but those who keep on changing the 
CBM's to favor the Greek Cypriots.

  [Text] Atay Ahmet Rasit, minster of foreign affairs and 
defense, has declared that the Turkish Cypriot side will 
continue to display its usual well-intentioned attitude in the 
negotiating process and in turn, expects the other relevant 
sides to demonstrate the same attitude and stand. Rasit stated 
that the Turkish Cypriot side expects all relevant parties to 
act in goodwill at the very least. 
  The foreign minister announced that the accusations leveled 
by European Union Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, who visited 
south Cyprus, against the Turkish Cypriots with regard to the 
confidence-building measures triggered amazement and regret in 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
  In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Rasit 
remarked that the departure statement issued by Van Den Broek, 
who did not feel the need to visit the Turkish Cypriot sector or 
listen to the views of Turkish Cypriot officials, is highly 
unfortunate on the part of those who claim they want to 
contribute to a lasting and just solution in Cyprus. 
  Given the goodwill and positive attitude demonstrated by the 
Turkish Cypriot side throughout the negotiating process, Rasit 
said, such prejudiced statements issued after listening to the 
views of only one side, at a time when efforts are being exerted 
to eliminate the difficulties created by the new elements 
introduced with the aim of satisfying Greek Cypriot 
Administration leader Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, 
greatly damage the ongoing negotiating process. 
  In a statement yesterday, Van Den Broek charged that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is pursuing an intransigent policy on the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures.

  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has sent a letter to 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, asking for the earliest 
possible settlement of the issues pending between Athens and 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Mr. 
Clinton pointed out that a solution that is fair to both sides 
can be found. Referring to the Cyprus issue, the U.S. President 
expressed his intention to have personal contacts with both 
interested parties, particularly with regard to the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Responding to a question from journalists on President Bill 
Clinton's letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made the following 
statement: President Clinton's letter to Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou was been sent in connection with the upcoming visit 
by Mr. Andreas Papandreou to the United States and refers 
concisely to all the issues that will be discussed. It is a 
friendly and constructive letter that constitutes a serious 
basis for discussion, given the U.S. intentions to address all 
the problems and de-escalate tensions. 
  Answering another relevant question, the Government 
spokesman 
made it clear that the question of Turkish troops being sent to 
Bosnia is not raised in the letter, while on the Skopje issue 
President Clinton outlined the well-known U.S. positions, which 
have also been expressed publicly.

Andreas Papandreou was asked to comment on the dispatch of 
Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: I am amazed 
that an army that invaded and occupied the northern part of 
Cyprus may be used for peacekeeping forces. It is amazing. 
  Asked about today's parade, Papandreou said: It was a 
perfect parade. Our Armed Forces are a strong force for 
safeguarding our country's integrity and defending peace.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou condemned the 
UN's decision to send Turkish troops to Bosnia, as the Greek 
political leadership appears to agree that our country should 
not send military forces there. 
  "I am amazed that an army that invaded the northern part of 
Cyprus may be used for peacekeeping purposes. It is amazing," 
Papandreou said after yesterday's military parade in Athens. 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos also expressed the 
Greek Government's regret because, "The UN's firm and tested 
criteria regarding the formation of its military forces was not 
implemented." The spokesman implied that neighboring countries 
should not be included in UN forces. "Greece remains faithful 
to these principles and will continue making all the necessary 
representations regarding the specific rules for the 
implementation of the UN decision," the spokesman added. 
  The UN decision was also condemned by the KKE [Greek 
Communist Party], which stressed that it "deepens the crisis in 
the region to a dangerous degree." The KKE called on the 
government "not to yield to pressure, to respect the unanimous 
decision of the last meeting of the political party leaders 
under the president, and not to send Greek troops to Bosnia 
under any circumstances." 
  Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis described the 
development as unfortunate. Although he said, "It is not time 
for criticism," he added: "Those who are responsible should 
think why Greece' position has diminished so tragically in 
general and in the Balkans in particular." Mitsotakis expressed 
satisfaction because "all Greeks agree that Greek troops should 
not be sent." He added that Greece should now try to see to it 
that the smallest possible number of Turkish troops are sent to 
Bosnia and that they be deployed between Croats and Muslims, 
without coming into contact with the Serbs. He concluded: "I 
think this is also the view supported by [UN Secretary General] 
Butrus-Ghali." 
  Following the 25th of March parade in Thessaloniki, 
Government Spokesman Venizelos said: "The Greek Government will 
approach the UN Security Council on its decision to dispatch 
Turkish blue berets in Bosnia." He made it clear that these 
contacts may achieve some results, but it will be on the rules 
that will govern the presence of Turkish soldiers in Bosnia. 
Asked to comment on the number of Turkish troops that will be 
send to Bosnia, the spokesman said: "Greece remains committed to 
the criteria that is normally used in the formation of UN 
forces, that is, countries that are historically or 
geographically involved should not participate. However, we 
cannot disregard the criteria for the implementation of this 
decision because of any violation." 
  Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras described the UN 
decision to send Turkish troops to Bosnia as foolish. Shortly 
before his departure for the United States, Samaras said that 
before making its final decision on the issue, the Greek 
Government should see what it will do with our Serb friends.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Blue-Helmet Bull" -- all </F>
punctuation as published] 
  [Text] The confusion was followed by some deep thinking, 
and it appears that the result will come from logic. At least, 
this is indicated by all signs from the government and almost 
all political parties on the pseudo-dilemma: whether our 
soldiers will go to Bosnia. 
  Let us look at the problem first. The United Nations damaged 
its prestige and called on Turkey, the pseudo-ambassador of 
peace--and not only "Attila" [nickname of Turkish forces in 
northern Cyprus]--to protect Bosnia with its arms, so it says. 
As all the countries appear unwilling to put blue helmets on 
their soldiers, the willingness of Ankara comes...perfectly 
dressed. Therefore, the United Nations and all who really 
dictate its decisions put aside principles in its best interest, 
as they interpret it. 
  On the contrary, Turkey is not damaging its principles. 
Turkey's principles are identical to its interests. Weapons 
and force are basic aspects of its principles; they are aspects 
that describe its historical identity. They have always been 
its tools for...imposing the peace. Consequently, Turkey is 
faithful to its history. 
  Our country has its own principles: in some cases, it would 
have been better if it had not had them. Greece's most 
important principle is its commitment to peace. It is a 
principle that has never been decorated with the...accessory of 
arms. 
  Of course, our country has interests, too. However, common 
sense does not find any interest that would be served by our 
engagement in Bosnia. What could be the purpose of an even 
peaceful Greek presence there that would also be dangerous? On 
the contrary, our presence under blue helmets in Bosnia would 
legalize the Turkish presence in the Balkans. Therefore, our 
country does not have any conflict of interests and principles 
that would tempt it to put them aside for once.... Consequently? 
  Consequently, there is no dilemma. There is an opportunity 
to transform our diplomacy and change the international climate 
that wants Greece to be Europe's black sheep. 
  If the international community cannot see the bull that 
pounces on the Balkan glass shop, it is in need of an eye 
doctor. The responsibility for what will follow will be passed 
by history onto those who ignored it and opened the door to 
"Attila," who this time is on a blue-helmeted bull.

morning when the military parade was taking place in Athens, 
about 20 Turkish F-16 and F-4 fighter aircraft entered the

Greek aircraft took off immediately and hastened to intercept 
the Turkish aircraft.

<F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis in Ioannina] </F>
  [Excerpts] The EU [European Union] foreign ministers' 
unofficial meeting began with some delay. The Yugoslav crisis 
and the EU's enlargement are at the center of discussions. 
According to reports, on the Yugoslav issue, the ministers 
examined the possibility of appointing a special commissioner 
for the area of Mostar. 
  The 12 ministers also discussed the issue of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's 
countermeasures. The Greek side stressed that the issue is 
primarily political and time should be allowed so ongoing 
mediation efforts produce results. In the framework of the 
discussion, the ministers discussed the recent letter by [FYROM 
President] Kiro Gligorov to EU Commission President Jacques 
Delors. [passage omitted] 
  The foreign ministers of many countries also referred to the 
issue of Skopje as they arrived in Ioannina, and it appears that 
our partners now recognize the political aspect of the issue 
even though they continue supporting the lifting of Greece's 
countermeasures. [passage omitted] 
  The issue of the EU's enlargement caused the first change to 
the meeting's agenda. It is a change that could prove important 
in its own particular way. 
  [Begin correspondent Simos Kedhikoglou recording] Despite 
procedural difficulties, the issue of the EU's enlargement will 
be at the center of the 12 ministers' discussions. A working 
group has already been set up to examine all the parameters of 
the problem. In addition, Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros 
Pangalos is having bilateral contacts with his counterparts. At 
the same time, the Greek presidency will present its own 
proposal with the support of the EU Commission and its 
president, Delors, in an attempt to seek a mutually acceptable 
solution. Indicative of the importance of the issue of the EU's 
enlargement are the remarks of the foreign ministers during 
their arrival at Ioannina, where they did not refrain from 
straightforward attacks against the countries that oppose the 
enlargement, mainly Britain. EU Commission President Delors was 
more reserved than all the others as he limited himself to a 
meaningful hand gesture. The general spirit is one of reserved 
optimism that the problem will be solved but there is an 
understanding of the difficulties. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- According to information from 
the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations and the Berlin 
police, top terrorist Carlos and his German accomplice Johannes 
Weinrich are still in Syria. Eyewitness reports say the two men 
are already well-known among German businessmen and German 
Embassy staff in Damascus, the news magazine DER SPIEGEL reports 
in its latest edition. 
  Carlos and Weinrich are alleged, among other things, to have 
been responsible for the bomb attack on the French Cultural 
Center in Berlin in August 1983, in which one person died. The 
German Government requested the extradition of the two 
terrorists from the Syrian Government in October 1992. 
  Recent questioning of returning German businessmen indicated 
that Weinrich was still openly moving around the Syrian capital 
in July 1993. The security authorities assume that Carlos and 
Weinrich are still in Damascus, SPIEGEL adds. However, this has 
been denied by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' to his 
German counterpart Klaus Kinkel last week, the magazine writes.

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din and Arlit Khuri: "Juppe: </F>
We Fear That Lebanon May Pay Price for Syria's Participation in 
Settlement"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris -- French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
said yesterday that there is concern over Lebanon's sovereignty 
and unity, stressing France's refusal to allow the abandonment 
of Lebanese sovereignty to be the price for Syria's 
participation in the peace process. He said that the disbanding 
of the "Lebanese Forces" while Hizballah continues to retain its 
weapons is tantamount to adopting a double standard. However, 
he stressed his support for the Lebanese Government, pointing 
out that the meeting he is going to hold today (Friday) with 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is the sixth of its kind in one 
year. [passage omitted] 
  During a breakfast banquet he held at the French Foreign 
Ministry with a number of Arab journalists in Paris, Juppe dealt 
with the situation in Algeria. He stressed that there has been 
no change in French policy toward Algeria, emphasizing France's 
willingness to support it financially. He pointed out that a 
new development is the appeal to French nationals "whose 
presence in Algeria is not essential" to return to their country 
because of the deteriorating security situation, which he hopes 
is temporary. 
  He stressed that French policy in the Middle East is still 
balanced and that his country is committed to the relations 
binding it to the Arab states and Israel. 
  With regard to Iraq, Juppe said that the information 
available to the United Nations about Iraqi weapons of mass 
destruction justifies an experimental phase, whose date is to be 
determined by the international committee. 
  On his opinion of the Lebanese Government's decision to 
disband the "Lebanese Forces" and prevent -- temporarily -- the 
media services in Lebanon from broadcasting [political] news 
bulletins, Juppe said that, "if that is true, it is not possible 
to settle problems by gagging the press." [passage omitted] 
  He added: "When we say that we are eager to prevent Lebanon 
from paying the price for peace in the region, this is clear -- 
and I have emphasized this before in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. 
Frankly, we do not want Lebanon's sovereignty to be the price 
for persuading Syria to participate in the peace process." 
  However, he added: "We have good relations with Syria, and 
we hope to keep them so. But we continue to stress the need for 
Lebanon to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity." 
  Asked whether he was concerned about Lebanon's sovereinty 
and 
unity, Juppe said: "Yes there is concern. Who is saying what I 
am saying? I hope other states will start to do so as well." 
  With regard to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from 
Lebanon, 
he said that "the Lebanese Government's position urging Israel's 
willingness to withdraw in accordance with Resolution 425 and to 
negotiate a timetable does not conflict with my reasoning. Once 
the security problem in southern Lebanon is solved, there will 
be no need for foreign forces to remain in Lebanon." 
  Asked whether he believes it is fair to disband the 
"Lebanese 
Forces" while Hizballah retains its weapons, Juppe said: "It 
reflects a double standard." [passage omitted] 
  He said that the "ugly crime committed against two 
Frenchmen in Algeria increases the number of French killed there 
to eight so far. As a result of the deterioration there, we 
have urged our nationals whose presence in Algeria is not 
essential to return to France. It is a matter of conscience. 
Some saw this as playing the extremists' game. But do we have 
the right to keep our nationals there amid very serious 
conditions? I do not believe so." 
  He added: "I must tell you that we are increasingly 
concerned as a result of the escalating violence. And we would 
like to hope that dialogue is still possible." He stressed the 
need to help Algeria "financially and by rescheduling its debts. 
This reflects the fact that France is probably the only country 
which offered Algeria 6 billion francs in 1993, and this year 
too." 
  He said that "our ability to intervene (in Algeria) is very 
limited and cannot go beyond lending advice. We have for 
several months been giving advice regarding the need for 
political dialogue and economic change. France cannot do more 
than that, and the solutions are in the hands of the Algerian 
authorities and the Algerian people." [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the French Embassy in Algeria is making 
contacts with the Islamists, Juppe said: "Our embassy makes 
contacts with anyone who supports dialogue, but, of course, we 
have no contacts with those carrying out the assassinations." 
  Asked whether France intends to provide military aid to 
Algeria, Juppe said "no." 
  With regard to the Middle East, Juppe described as untrue 
reports of a change in French policy in the region. "It is not 
new to say that France is a friend of both the Arabs and the 
Israelis. This has not changed. But it seems that it is not 
easy to convince everyone of this." [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question about Iraq, he said: "We do not need 
lessons from anyone at this level. It is natural for French 
institutions to prepare for the stage that will follow the 
[lifting of] the embargo imposed on Iraq. All the big powers 
are working on this basis." 
  He stressed that the French position on Iraq remainsthe 
same, 
and it stipulates "the safeguarding of Iraq's unity, on the 
grounds that it is a fundamental factor for the region's 
stability. Anything liable to harm this unity worries us, 
because it would affect stability. Besides, the Security 
Council resolutions do not entitle the United Nations to choose 
the Iraqi regime. That is not among our aims. It is an Iraqi 
question. I am often told that under a totalitarian regime 
words are always easier than actions. But this applies to many 
of the regimes in the region. France is seeking to compel it 
[the Iraqi regime] to fully implement all the international 
resolutions adopted against it." 
  Juppe stressed that "questions related to freedoms and human 
rights are not negotiable: Either they are respected or not." 
  He added: "With regard to the elimination of the weapons of 
mass destruction, protracted and thorough investigations have 
been conducted in this connection by the special UN committee 
headed by Rolf Ekeus and we have noted that the Iraqis responded 
to it, sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly. On the 
basis of the available information, it has been decided to 
impose an experimental phase on Iraq to ascertain the extent of 
its compliance with the removal of the weapons systems in its 
possession." 
  He stressed that "the special committee has to set a date 
for 
the start of the experimental phase, because that falls under 
its, not France's, jurisdiction." 
  He said that Iraq had sent a message to the United Nations 
in 
which it stressed its respect for Kuwait's sovereignty, but 
failed to mention respect for the common border. 
  Asked whether he supports U.S. policy on the dual 
containment 
of Iraq and Iran, Juppe stressed that "we have no fundamental 
disagreement with U.S. policy in the region, but we do not use 
the same phrases. What we want from Iraq is implementation of 
the international resolutions. As for Iran, we are pusuing a 
critical dialogue with it." 
  He pointed out that "some Iranian positions are causing 
problems for us, including, for example, the issue of the writer 
Salman Rushdie and Iran's position on the peace process in the 
Middle East -- a position which we cannot describe as 
constructive. There is also ambiguity in terms of Iran's 
relations with some terrorist movements. All this explains the 
critical dialogue between us." 
  With regard to Libya, Juppe said that there has been no 
further development in the Libyan position. "They told us in a 
message of their willingness to respond to the specified legal 
demands, but this willingness has not materialized yet." 
  On events in Yemen, he expressed his hope that the agreement 
signed among Yemeni parties in Amman would be implemented. He 
pointed out that "France will participate in the proceedings of 
the Omani-Jordanian military observation committee."

  [Text] The vote today and tomorrow vote is considered to be 
of historic importance. For Italy it is a matter of turning a 
page in history, and it is the voters who are deciding the 
transition from the First to the Second Republic. Voting is 
taking place in a completely calm atmosphere. This morning the 
most important state figures cast their votes. Rocco Tolfa 
reports. 
  [Tolfa] Quiet please, we are voting. Italians are going to 
the polls and the party leaders are keeping quiet after a fiery 
electoral campaign. However, the leading figures of the Italian 
state are saying that these elections truly represent a historic 
turning point. This was stressed by President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, who voted in his hometown of Novara. The head of 
state said this is a decisive moment in the history of our 
country. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who cast his vote 
in Rome, stressed the importance of this vote when he spoke to 
our reporter, Anna La Rosa. 
  [Begin Ciampi recording] I hope that the Saturday of silence 
helped the Italian people to meditate internally and to ask 
themselves questions about past experiences and about the true 
interests of the country in the future. [end recording] 
  [Tolfa] Ciampi refused to say any more. He held up the law 
of electoral silence, which he said he did not intend to break 
so as not to disturb the Italian voters who are about to turn a 
new page.

<F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Jagland: EU `Yes' Even Without </F>
Sweden"] 
  [Text] "We have won respect for what are peculiarly 
Norwegian characteristics and conditions," Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland said of Norway's EU [European Union] 
membership agreement in the Antennetimen program yesterday. 
  Well-known arguments raged back and forth across the table 
in 
the first -- and very heated -- EU duel between the leading 
figures on the yes and no sides: Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland and Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein. They 
were assisted by Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Center 
Party parliamentary leader John J. Jakobsen. 
  The Center Party leaders completely disagreed with 
Brundtland: They argued that Norway would lose its national 
identity as an EU member. "It will be impossible to be an 
independent nation," Lahnstein said. While Jakobsen claimed 
that we are now seeing the formation of a new state, and that 
German Chancellor Kohl has the goal of a United States of Europe. 
  The prime minister took Jakobsen to mean that borders will 
be 
scrapped -- and argued strongly against such a view. 
  Lahnstein said that we have lost our right of control over 
fish resources in the north, while the prime minister found it 
impossible to believe that the fisheries minister had been 
tricked. 
  Gro Harlem Brundtland had dressed in green for the occasion, 
while Anne Enger Lahnstein was all in red. "We go better 
together now than we did at the party leader debate," the prime 
minister said, recalling that on that occasion they both turned 
up is shades of red -- and sat side by side. Yesterday they 
were placed at opposite ends of the table, but were quickly 
involved in hand-to-hand fighting. 
  Thorbjorn Jagland did not seem particularly interested in 
answering the question of whether he would recommend a no if a 
majority in Sweden said no to the EU. The program chairman 
pointed to earlier statements that the Nordic area should stand 
united. Jagland said that the people must decide, but said 
finally that the Labor Party will maintain its position -- that 
is, that the party will recommend a yes to membership, 
regardless of the Swedes' choice. 
  Both Jagland and Brundtland made it clear that they want a 
referendum in Norway after the referendums in Sweden and 
Finland. The Labor Party leaders asked whether the Center Party 
is unable to see what is democratic -- and hinted that what is 
democratic would be to satisfy the wishes of those who want to 
see what choices Norway's neighbors reach before casting their 
own votes. 
  Center Party parliamentary leader Johan J. Jakobsen said 
that 
he does not attach any great importance to the timing of a 
referendum -- he expects a clear no regardless. But he would 
prefer coordination with Sweden and Finland. Jagland for his 
part claimed that he does not think that there is a greater 
chance of a yes if the Norwegians vote after the Swedes.

  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur claimed victory for his conservative coalition in local 
elections Sunday [27 March] and hinted that he would modify a 
controversial plan to lower the minimum wage for young people. 
  Speaking on television after polls closed in the 
second-round 
voting, Balladur said the French people had "confirmed the 
results of the first round" in which the two right-wing parties 
in his coalition won more than 44 percent of the votes. 
  Balladur thanked the French people for their support "all 
the 
more because these are difficult times" -- an allusion to a wave 
of student protests over the past two weeks against his youth 
employment plan. 
  Conceding that his proposals "are causing concern," Balladur 
said he would announce an initiative in the next few days "to 
reestablish dialogue." 
  "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the 
government," 
he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people."

  [Text] Mersin, Mar 26, (AA) -- A gunman was killed and a 
policeman was wounded in an overnight election-related clash in 
this southern city, police said on Saturday [26 March]. 
  The clash started when gunmen, fleeing after throwing a bomb 
at the election office of the pro-Islamic Welfare [Prosperity] 
Party, fired on police, who urged them to surrender. One of the 
gunmen was killed, the others fled. 
  Five other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed 
and 26 were wounded in the last couple of days in several 
assaults on party offices and candidates in the run-up to 
Sunday's nationwide municipal elections.

  [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's morale was 
strengthened from the other side of the ocean five days before 
the local elections. President Clinton reiterated his support 
for Ciller in a surprise message to her yesterday. He said he 
will support Turkey's effort to effect economic reform. 
  Clinton's five-page message reached Ankara through 
diplomatic 
channels yesterday. It replied to the expectations and requests 
that Ciller conveyed to President Clinton during their telephone 
conversations and in recent messages they exchanged. 
  Clinton reportedly replied to Ciller's request for U.S. 
support to the Turkish economy by saying that $5 billion of 
Eximbank credit has been released for Turkey's imports. The 
U.S. Eximbank credit can only be used for imports from that 
country. 
  Clinton's message also expressed support for Turkey's 
request 
for World Bank credit. It said the United States would adopt a 
constructive approach toward concluding the negotiations on a 
World Bank credit package for Turkey of $2.7 billion. 
  The Gulf Fund was another issue in which President Clinton 
promised to support Ciller. Her request regarding that fund was 
one of the most important appeals to the United States. The 
Gulf Fund, earmarked for the second phase of the F-16 project in 
Turkey, is being held in the United States. It was established 
with a contribution by the Gulf States for the production of 160 
F-16 aircraft. Ciller has asked that the fund be placed under 
the Turkish Treasury Department's control. 
  Although the United States has not opposed the transfer of 
the fund to Turkey, it has objected to the use of the fund for 
other purposes. But the message said Clinton has agreed to a 
formula that will enable Turkey to benefit from the interest on 
the fund. 
  President Clinton's message failed to satisfy Ciller's 
expectation of an agreement to have the oil embargo on Iraq 
relaxed. On the possibility of the withdrawal of a limited 
amount of oil from the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq, the 
message is reported to have said that the talks should be 
maintained. That was a sign that the United States opposed that 
idea. 
  President Clinton thanked Ciller for the support she has 
given to resuming the talks on Cyprus and informed her that he 
discussed the problem of the Workers Party of Kurdistan with 
President Hafiz al-Asad when he met him some time ago.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel, who has concluded his 
official visit to Romania as the guest of Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, has returned to Turkey. At Ankara Esenboga Airport, 
Demirel was received by Assembly Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk 
with ceremony. Chief of Staff General Dogan Gures, State 
Minister Aykon Dogan, and other officials were present at the 
ceremony. 
  In a statement at Esenboga Airport, Demirel said that his 
contacts in Romania had been very beneficial. Assessing 
bilateral relations in his airport statement, Demirel said the 
following: 
  The absence of any conflicts between our countries and the 
feelings of sincerity between the two peoples have constituted 
the sound foundation of our developing relations in all fields. 
With such an understanding we have discussed, in the political 
field, regional problems and international issues concerning 
both countries. We have dwelled on what Turkey and Romania, as 
two great and important countries of the region, might 
contribute to achieve peace and stability in the Balkans and the 
Black Sea region. Demirel continued: In the economic field we 
share the view that the two countries can increase their trade 
volume to $2 billion in a short period. We have also decided to 
encourage mutual investments. To achieve that end we agreed that 
work will be speeded up to conclude a free trade agreement. 
Turkey and Romania will jointly benefit from the free trade 
zone existing and to be expanded in the two countries. The $75 
million Eximbank loan Turkey has extended to Romania will be 
activated. We also envisage establishing cultural centers in 
Istanbul and Constantsa. 
  Demirel said that they were deeply touched by the great 
affection and hospitality shown to the Turkish delegation in 
Romania and added: No doubt, this great honor paid to us is 
directed toward our country and our people. He noted that 
relations with Romania have attained a considerable impetus as a 
result of the contacts made with Iliescu in the last few years. 
Demirel stated that his visit once more confirmed the strength 
of the political will necessary to develop bilateral relations 
in all fields. He concluded by saying: I would like to stress 
that my visit was most beneficial and timely within the 
framework of the continuing crises in our region and the rapidly 
changing conditions. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin returned to Turkey together 
with Demirel.

"`Everything Has Collapsed'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Why did your country deny IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors the right to 
remove dust samples from the radiochemical laboratory at the 
Yongbyon reprocessing plant? 
  [Yun] The removal of such samples from glove compartments in 
September 1992 led to results that differed from our data. We 
want all these old technical questions to be settled first. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA accuses you of possessing more 
plutonium than you have reported to the organization. 
  [Yun] This technical problem should be resolved by technical 
experts. We have proposed an international seminar and want to 
invite experts from all over the world, including Germany, to 
conduct a joint experiment. That will allow the truth to be 
established. Instead of taking up this proposal, the inspectors 
are using satellite photographs provided by a hostile power in 
their work to prove something to us. That is not permitted. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA is using the photographs as a basis 
for checking two undeclared storage points for nuclear waste. 
  [Yun] They were shown to the inspectors once, and they were 
able to see with their own eyes that these are military 
installations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is irrelevant for inspections. Can one 
find proof there that your country is capable of building a bomb? 
  [Yun] The CIA can say whatever it wants to. It is not true. 
We have a clear conscience. Our country has neither the 
intention of building a nuclear weapon nor does it has the 
capability to do so. We do not need such a weapon. The entire 
dispute with the IAEA is over 58 grams of plutonium. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If only such a small quantity is missing, then 
why do you not simply agree to the inspections that have been 
called for? 
  [Yun] It is not part of our treaty with the IAEA, and it 
would be an infringement of our country's sovereignty. We find 
that totally unacceptable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you risking war over a few grams of 
plutonium? 
  [Yun] The United States has been very hostile toward us for 
a long time. We fear that it wants to destroy our country. 
They are gradually making preparations for a new war. During 
the Korean War in the 1950's, they killed everyone. Many of my 
relatives died then, although they were only children. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is there no more possibility of reaching a 
compromise with the IAEA? 
  [Yun] Everything has collapsed now. The matter has gotten 
out of control. Now, a solution can only be found through 
direct contacts between the United States and our country. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Under what circumstances would your government 
go to war? 
  [Yun] If the United States tried to destroy us. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Whom do you mean by "us?" The inhabitants of 
your country? 
  [Yun] And the political system. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What consequences would an economic boycott 
have? 
  [Yun] It would be a measure aimed at destroying the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

  [Text] Geneva, March 28 (AFP) -- Developing countries 
flatly rejected on Monday [28 March] any bid by major Western 
industrial nations to raise the issue of a "social clause" in 
world trade agreements at next month's GATT ministerial parley 
at Marrakesh. 
  They argued it was up to each sovereign state to take care 
of 
its labour standards, and warned that linking such issues to 
trade could result in protectionist measures outlawed in the 
world trade pact concluded here last December. 
  The issue has been pushed by the United States and France, 
whose 11 partners in the European Union have adopted a more 
cautious stance, seeking to avoid antagonizing the developing 
world. 
  Trade negotiators here said they feared the issue could cast 
a long shadow over the parley, scheduled for April 12-15 in the 
south Moroccan city to cap the seven-year Uruguay Round of GATT 
trade negotiations. 
  Brazil, speaking for the caucus of developing nations in 
GATT 
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), expressed their 
"utmost concern" about proposals to include "workers rights and 
international labour standards" on the agenda of the future 
World Trade Organization (WTO) which is to succeed GATT. 
  Developing nations specifically rejected a United States 
proposal for a passage referring to this issue to be added to a 
draft ministerial Declaration to be adopted by the Marrakesh 
conference. 
  The text proposed by the United States calls for 
"consideration of the relationship between the trading system 
and internationally recognized labour standards" to be 
undertaken even before the WTO becomes operational sometime in 
1995. 
  Developing countries considered that this would not be 
"acceptable," Brazilian ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia told a 
meeting of GATT delegation heads, one of the last sessions in 
preparation for the Marrakesh conference. 
  Lampreia said the developing countries "strongly" felt it 
was 
not up to the preparatory committee for the WTO to discuss "any 
substantive issue" which was not part of the final package of 
the Uruguay Round negotiations, except "trade and environment" 
which was raised in a specific draft "ministerial decision." 
  The ambassador pointed to a statement by GATT Director 
General Peter Sutherland last January 20 in which he told 
delegation heads the Marrakesh conference should "focus 
primarily on the implementation" of the results of the Uruguay 
Round. 
  The GATT chief in the same statement warned it would be 
"unrealistic" to try to negotiate in the run-up to the Marrakesh 
meeting "new agreements or mandates in areas which were not 
envisaged" when the Round was closed on December 15. 
  Lampreia noted that Sutherland had underscored in his 
remarks 
that the participating ministers would have an opportunity, in 
their individual statements to the conference, to "indicate 
their wishes for new areas of activity to be taken up by the 
WTO." 
  The Brazilian ambassador said it was "the considered view" 
of 
the developing nations as a group that "the attainment of higher 
labour standards is fundamentally a matter of debate within each 
individual sovereign state." 
  He warned against attempts to establish a link between such 
issues and trade, "instead of reflecting any legitimate concern 
for conditions of work in developing countries and the 
protection of human rights." 
  This, he said, "can actually result in protectionist 
measures 
designed to nullify or offset comparative advantage, and 
jeopardize the efforts being made by governments to raise wages 
and improve social conditions."

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly] </F>
  [Text] Ever since 1986 the minke whale has been on a par 
with the rhinoceros, the elephant, and the panda in the 
Washington Convention's list of especially endangered species, 
known as the List 1 species. The Norwegian Government wants to 
have the minke whale transferred to List 2 in order to 
facilitate international trade in minke whale products. 
  "The present listing of the minke whale is unheard of from a 
scientific point of view. The minke whale has no business being 
in the same category as the rhinoceros and the panda," Bjorn 
Reppe, special adviser in the Fisheries Ministry, said. 
<H5>  120,000 Animals </H5>
  The demand for a change in listing has been sent to the 14 
nations in the North Atlantic region that would be affected. 
The Norwegian overture follows initiatives from the Directorate 
for Natural Resources Management, the Fisheries Ministry, and 
the Environmental Protection Ministry. 
  Norwegian authorities say that research shows that there are 
120,000 minke whales in the regions around Great Britain, 
Iceland, and Norway. 
  Of these, 87,000 belong to the northeast Atlantic variety 
that Norwegian whalers want to hunt commercially. Researchers 
estimate that there are about 1 million minke whales globally. 
<H5>  Norwegian Exception </H5>
  Norway is one of 120 nations that have signed the Washington 
Convention regulating international trade in endangered plant 
and animal species. At any given time there are a couple of 
thousand species on the CITES [Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] list. The list 
is drawn up as the result of regularly held meetings of the 
member countries. The minke whale was put on the list in 1986 
following a suggestion from the Seychelles. Norway took 
exception to prohibiting export and import of minke whale, 
finback, and sperm whale. The Norwegian authorities believe 
that this legally enables them to allow trade in such products. 
  The Washington Convention strictly prohibits export and 
import of List 1 species that are defined as especially 
endangered. Only controlled exchanges of material between 
researchers and museums are permitted. Trade is allowed for the 
species on List 2 if the CITES secretariat issues a license. 
The control remains stringent, however, to ensure that the 
licensed trade does not exceed certain limits. 
  "The polar bear and the walrus are among northern species on 
CITES' List 2," Oystein Storkersen of the Directorate for 
Natural Resources Management said. He is not too optimistic 
about getting the Norwegian proposal accepted by the majority of 
the members of the Washington Convention. "Unfortunately the 
countries are governed by feelings, not facts, in their view of 
the whale," he said.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The Cabinet today agreed to accept the so-called 
Greek compromise in the storm over European voting powers -- as 
yet another crisis erupted for the Prime Minister. 
  John Major is making a Commons statement this afternoon amid 
fierce denials by the Brussels-based European Commission that 
Britain has been given guarantees about social policy 
legislation as "sweeteners" for backing the votes plan. 
  This is expected to set the Commons ablaze with claims by 
Tory Euro-sceptics that the Government has been duped by a 
Commission which one backbencher branded today as "totally 
untrustworthy." 
  The Cabinet reached agreement after a two-hour session this 
morning -- the last meeting before the Easter holidays. 
  Employment Secretary David Hunt earlier indicated that 
assurances emanating from Brussels overnight cleared the way for 
Ministers to accept the compromise in a bid to end the storm. 
  But the claims by Mr Hunt -- and later confirmation by 
Downing Street of "oral" guarantees -- were met with surprise 
and puzzlement in Brussels. 
  [Ministers emerged from the Cabinet meeting smiling but 
tight-lipped. 
  [The Prime Minister, celebrating his 51st birthday today, 
will set out the Government's stance to the Commons, including 
details of the guarantees said to have been received overnight. 
  [However, Euro-sceptics are already denouncing the 
compromise 
as a climbdown. Their disappointment is expected to turn to 
fury when they hear that Brussels is denying any assurances were 
given. 
  [It was effectively on the basis of these "assurances" that 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd recommended with confidence the 
package he brought back from the European Union foreign 
ministers' meeting in Greece over the weekend. 
  [The Commission was surprised by British claims that it had 
given assurances of no more "back door" social policy under the 
guise of health and safety. 
  [A spokesman said the talks between Britain, Commission 
president Jacques Delors and Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig 
Flynn had done nothing more than "remind" Ministers of the 
situation. 
  [This is expected to fuel Euro-critics' suspicions that 
Britain has been the victim of a sell-out.]

<F P=106> [Bjarne Stenquist report: "af Ugglas Warned EU Countries"] </F>
  [Text] Ioannina -- On Sunday [27 March] the Swedish 
Government conveyed to the EU's [European Union] twelve foreign 
ministers its "concern and dismay" over the fact that the EU has 
still not been able to resolve its internal conflict over voting 
which is slowing down Swedish membership of the EU. 
  This happened when Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas 
participated in the final session of the EU foreign minsters' 
meeting in Ioannina in northern Greece. 
  "I also warned that if they cannot reach agreement before 
Easter this could do serious damage to our efforts to win 
support for the European idea among the general public in 
Sweden," af Ugglas told DAGENS NYHETER. 
  The same message was delivered jointly by the four foreign 
ministers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria in 
individual conversations with British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana. 
  "There was no real drama; we sat Hurd and Solana in the 
corner of a sofa and said that we were all concerned about what 
is happening," Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told 
DAGENS NYHETER. 
  "Britain will have to carry a heavy responsibility if the 
candidate countries' membership is pushed forward in time," 
Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto told Finnish 
journalists. 
  But the most strident phrases from the four candidate 
countries came from Margaretha af Ugglas who is, however, now 
hopeful about a solution. 
  "But if it proves possible to reach agreement on Tuesday or 
Wednesday, we can move forward with the preparations for the 
referendums as we have planned. And then the uncertainty of the 
past month will largely be a closed episode. 
  ``Everything else is an impossibility, seen from our 
viewpoint. If the matter cannot be resolved now, but is put off 
instead, this will have an effect on all our planning and could 
in the final analysis also lead to our having to change the date 
of the referendum,'' the foreign minister said. 
  "But my impression is that, it will be possible to finally 
resolve this matter on Tuesday," Margaretha af Ugglas said. 
  "The warnings from the candidate countries made a strong 
impression on me," Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told 
DAGENS NYHETER. 
  "It is definitely the case that this matter has led to a 
situation in which the European Union is beginning to lose 
credibility," Claes added. 
  "I have just had a meeting with the foreign ministers of 
Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria and they are becoming more 
concerned and dismayed the longer the time that passes without 
an agreement. This is yet another aspect that we have to think 
about," Douglas Hurd said in an interview with BBC Radio.

<F P=106> [Article by Jos Klaassen: "EU Takes Greece to European </F>
Court -- Athens Is Given Two Months To Lift Embargo on 
Macedonia"] 
  [Excerpt] Ioannina -- The European Union [EU] is to summon 
Greece before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The 
Greeks have broken the EU's economic legislation with their 
trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM]. But Athens is to be given a maximum of two months 
respite to lift the embargo; otherwise a trial will take place 
in Luxembourg. 
  Legal action against Greece became more probable after 11 
European foreign ministers meeting in the Greek town of Ioannina 
on Sunday [27 March] unanimously condemned Athens's actions 
against FYROM. The European Commission (EC) had asked the 
ministers to give a political judgement before the Commission 
took action against Greece. 
  Commission President Jacques Delors said that the crisis 
between Greece and FYROM had too many political aspects for the 
issue to be written off as simply an infringement of European 
law. The ministers have now given the judgement asked of them. 
  Only Luxembourg Minister Jacques Poos tried to reach a 
compromize during the informal European ministerial council 
meeting in Ioannina. He suggested that Greece should lift the 
embargo, and in exchange the EU would negotiate with FYROM about 
the sticking points between Greece and FYROM. 
  The Greeks want FYROM to remove the "Star of Vergina" from 
its flag, because it is regarded by Athens as a Greek symbol. 
The Greeks also feel that FYROM's Constitution calls for the 
absorption of the Greek province of Macedonia. Greece, a member 
of NATO, apparently feels threatened by FYROM's 6,000-strong 
Army. 
  Poos's compromise was unacceptable for German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel in particular. The proposal would mean 
that the EU fully identified with the Greek demands. The 
foreign ministers rejected the defense of Greek Foreign Minister 
Theo Pangalos that Athens had announced the embargo for security 
reasons. 
  An EU member state is allowed to take measures which 
restrict 
trade if its external security is threatened, according to 
European rules. Pangalos believes that the European treaty also 
allows the rules to be diverged from if there is a danger to 
domestic security. 
  The violent demonstrations in Thessaloniki, Athens, and 
elsewhere against FYROM are claimed as proof that Greece's 
domestic security is at stake. Pangalos's arguments were found 
wanting by Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. 
  Now that the 11 foreign ministers are sticking by their 
condemnation of Greece, the Commission, as the guardian of 
European economic legislation, can no longer hold off from legal 
action. European Foreign Affairs Commissioner Van den Broek said 
on Sunday in Ioannina that a distinction would be made between 
the EU's legal case against Greece on the one hand and the 
continuation of the search for a political solution on the other. 
  Right from the start the Commission has tried to convince 
Greece politically to lift the embargo against FYROM. At the 
end of February, Van den Broek shuttled between Athens and FYROM. 
  He looked into the possibilities of an agreement between the 
two countries. His conclusion was that the lifting of the 
embargo would free the way for negotiations with FYROM. On 
Sunday in Ioannina, Van den Broek once again called for a 
political solution. However, it is not the EU which is playing 
the main role in this respect, but the UN American mediator 
Cyrus Vance.

  [Text] The European Justice Council has made no progress on 
drawing up common rules on extradition because most EU [European 
Union] states are reluctant to surrender their own nationals to 
another state. Discussion also stumbled over whether political 
offences should be a motive for refusing extradition, a view 
that was not shared by Greece. "All (EU) member states have a 
democratic regime and live in a democratic atmosphere...it's not 
normal, therefore, that you should invoke political reasons," 
Greek Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis told reporters in 
Brussels.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Steel Sector Makes </F>
Restructuring Agreement -- Toward New Closures in Italy"] 
  [Text] The European Commission and private companies have 
made a draft agreement on further reductions in the production 
capacity of rolled products. 
  The European Commission and the private steel companies have 
reached a draft agreement on the restructuring of the European 
Union's (EU) steel industry, a spokesman of the European 
executive announced on Thursday [24 March]. The steelmakers 
have committed themselves to new capacity reductions of 8 
million tonnes in order to reach a global reduction of 19 
million tonnes in the crisis-ridden hot-rolled product sector. 
But they asked for a delay to agree on the practical 
implementation of the reductions. "There is a time problem, but 
no problem on the fundamental issue," the spokesman said after a 
dinner on Wednesday which brought together the private managers 
with European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Karel 
Van Miert, his colleague responsible for competition. The 
Commission has decided to ask the EU's industry ministers, who 
are to meet on 22 April, to extend the Community support 
measures accompanying the restructuring of the sector until 
November. In early 1994, exasperated by the refusal of the 
steelmakers to accept capacity reductions, it threatened to 
suspend the release of the planned aid, some ECU500 million, for 
the social part of the plan. 
  To the great relief of the Commission, the steelmakers 
promised to not request help from their national governments in 
order to stabilize their accounts between here and November 
1994. And even if the managers of British Steel stayed away 
from the dinner on Wednesday, the Commission emphasized that 
Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association], the association 
which gathers the steelmakers together, said it also spoke in 
the name of the British company. 
  However, the global restructuring plan has yet to be 
completed. And, even if it is completed next autumn, after a 
delay of one year which is not without consequence, industry 
experts point out that the figure of 19 million tonnes 
represents the minimum necessary to achieve a durable 
stabilization of the sector. The Commission estimated last 
year, when it presented a catastrophic assessment of the sector, 
that hot-rolled capacity would have to be reduced by between 19 
and 25 million tonnes to restore balance in the market. The 
private steelmakers had already committed themselves to reducing 
their capacity by 5 million tonnes, while the public groups 
agreed to do the same for 6 million tonnes in exchange for a 
final aid package of ECU7 billion to stabilize the companies, 
often before their privatization. So 8 million tonnes still 
have to be found, and the private steelmakers have said they are 
prepared to give half of that, thanks to closures in Bresciani 
in Italy. The rest will be obtained via mergers or 
specialization agreements between the steelmakers. It is a 
delicate operation, and the Commission has warned that it will 
watch to see that competition is strictly respected to avoid the 
formation of dominant groups in this sensitive sector.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The maiden flight of the 32 billion pound sterling 
Eurofighter 2000 was a success, much to the relief of 
industrialists and politicians in the four partner nations. 
  It will be the world's most advanced fighter aircraft apart 
from the American F-22, which will be more than twice as costly 
and several years later entering service. 
  Eurofighter is designed as a highly agile multi-role 
aircraft, capable of ground-attack as well as its primary air 
defence role. 
  Developed by Britain (33 percent), Germany (33 percent), 
Italy (21 percent), and Spain (13 percent), it will replace the 
RAF's Jaguars, Tornado F3's and now defunct Phantoms from the 
year 2000. 
  It is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft requiring 
on-board 
computers to make thousands of calculations every second to keep 
it in the air by controlling the flaps, rudder and front 
"canard" wings. 
  The single-seat cockpit is highly automatised to allow the 
pilot maximum time to engage the enemy. 
  Powered by two new EJ200 engines, it has a top speed of 
twice 
the speed of sound and can operate between the limits of nine 
times the force of gravity and minus three times gravity in 
tight turns and other manoeuvres. 
  On normal missions it will carry two short-range and four 
medium-range air-to-air missiles. A 27mm cannon is carried 
internally. 
  The advanced ECR90 radar developed by GEC-Ferranti will 
allow 
pilots to detect, track and fire at enemy aircraft well beyond 
visual range. 
  Eurofighter is also equipped with an infra-red search and 
track system that will enable pilots to spot the enemy by 
detecting minute differences in temperature between the target 
and its background. 
  This will complement the radar as it is a passive system so 
it cannot be detected and it makes "stealth" aircraft visible.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilhelm Theuretsbacher: "Missile Terrorism With </F>
Chemicals From Salzburg?"] 
  [Text] Dictators in the Third World were highly interested. 
A special propellant is required for firing missiles on Europe, 
which could be purchased in Salzburg -- until last week. 
  In a concerted action by the Economics, Finance, and 
Interior 
Ministries, the filing cabinets of a Salzburg firm were opened 
during a search of the office. The subsidiary of a foreign 
company produced special aluminum and magnesium compounds, which 
reached Latin America and the Middle and Far East in a 
roundabout way. 
  The buyers are mainly states that are trying to convert 
obsolete missile systems. The most widespread missiles -- like 
the "Scud" missiles that became know as a result of the Gulf war 
-- are being propelled by liquid fuels and have a range of 600 
km in the original version. Only a few states have systems with 
wider ranges. Numerous countries, including Libya, Syria, and 
Iran, want to increase the range to 2,000 km with the aid of 
solid propellants. Thus, "targets" like Vienna, Paris, or Rome 
are becoming realistic. 
  The basis for the conversion is the metallic powder that was 
offered illegally in Salzburg. The investigating authorities 
have examined dozens of deliveries. Like nearly everything else 
in this case, the exact extent of the damage is a top secret. 
  The Salzburg company has violated the amended foreign trade 
law. The responsible officials are facing 10-year prison terms. 
Moreover, the deliveries also infringed the MTCR Agreement 
[Missile Technology Control Regime], designed to prevent the 
proliferation of missile technology. The suspects deny any 
criminal intent. The fuel components can also be used for 
civilian purposes -- such as fireworks. 
  For the Austrian police, the operation was a first in a new 
criminal sphere, called "proliferation." It refers to the 
illegal procurement of nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare 
agents, including the relevant carrier technology. These 
economic crimes with an intensive intelligence background are 
new ground for the police. The usual methods do not yield the 
desired results in this area. The police need highly qualified 
experts like physical and chemical engineers and economic 
experts. 
  The counterstrategy is police reform. As a result of the 
reform of the antiterrorism task force (EBT), the Interior 
Ministry has scored several international successes in the 
sphere of terrorism, the smuggling of refugees, and nuclear 
crime. This is one of the reasons why EBT leader Josef Dick was 
appointed as provisional head of Group D (criminal police). His 
task is to initiate the overdue reform among the criminal police.

<F P=106> [Philippe Berkenbaum report: "Belgacom Seeks a Partner -- </F>
Introduction on the Bourse"] 
  [Excerpt] No longer say "privatization" with regard to 
Belgacom, say "strategic consolidation." That is the term used 
by the government since yesterday to describe the future of the 
former RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration]. At an 
extraordinary cabinet meeting, the Dehaene team settled this 
issue, which has been generating rumors for months. The state 
will keep control of the public enterprise and sell a maximum of 
49 percent of it according to a timetable that has not yet been 
drawn up. But, the prime minister explained, "the main part of 
the yield will come in 1995-1996 rather than in 1994." 
  What the government decided yesterday is in fact to proceed 
to the selection of one or several industrial partners for 
Belgacom. Supporting the analysis of Communications Minister 
Elio Di Rupo, it intends to strengthen the Belgian operator to 
enable it to face competition. This competition is already 
appearing, especially in the sphere of international 
communications, but will be complete from 1998, according to the 
European Council's decision. On that date, national 
telecommunications monopolies in Europe will come to an end. To 
survive, Belgacom will have to form an alliance with other 
operators. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Andre Riche commentary: "The Belgians on the Front Page of </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Belgium is back in the headlines regarding two 
highly important European issues: the European Union (EU) 
enlargement from 12 to 16 members and the succession of Jacques 
Delors at the head of the European Commission (EC). These two 
events are apparently unrelated, except for the fact that they 
are to take place at the same time: in January 1995. A closer 
look reveals that the stakes are very similar, and will have a 
major impact on the future and nature of the EU. And when the 
nature of European integration is at stake, our country -- loyal 
to its federalist tradition -- is never slow to react. So much 
the better. 
  Belgium has always distrusted the enlargement. It made this 
known in good time: Two years ago, well before the beginning of 
negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. It 
repeated its position Tuesday [22 March], while the Twelve took 
leave of each other angry and unable to adapt their 
decisionmaking procedure to a Union that is going to expand to 
16 members. 
  The Twelve still have a chance -- albeit a slight one -- to 
defuse the crisis during their meeting next weekend in Greece. 
However, even if they manage to do that, they will not get away 
unscathed. 
  The enlargement is splitting the seams between north and 
south, as well as between Great Britain and the continent. 
Above all, it has ended up looking like an uncautious and 
relentless pursuit forward, in view of the failure to 
consolidate the institutional foundations of the European 
edifice in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1991, when they conceived 
Maastricht, the Twelve postponed the work of deepening [the 
Union] until later negotiations. These were scheduled for 1996. 
  It is true that the temptation to enlarge was strong, even 
on 
shaky foundations. It was a way of regaining prestige for the 
Union, giving it a more dynamic appearance, and concealing the 
many reasons for giving up hope in it: The economic recession, 
the mixed success of the single market, the maintenance of 
border checks, the crisis in the monetary system, diplomatic 
impotence, etc. And now the enlargement, too, is stuck in a rut! 
  The current dispute -- concerning a partial and temporary 
aspect of the institutional reform -- does not augur at all well 
for the chances of success of the 1996 conference, because, 
apart from the arithmetic extrapolation of a voting system, the 
fundamental principles are already clashing. Belgium could not 
remain silent. It stressed -- fortunately, with the support of a 
majority of the member states -- the danger of burdening the 
decisionmaking process. It also confirmed that it would not 
yield, because no matter what London's views are on the matter 
-- London calls the Belgians "dogmatic" -- it is not even a 
question of lightening the current procedures, but simply of 
extrapolating them. 
  This is worrying because, according to the formula, we 
cannot 
do good politics without good institutions. This formula is 
even more valid for the EU, because, unlike the states which 
comprise it, in only still exists through its institutions. 
  What about the successor to Jacques Delors? In 10 years, 
Jacques Delors himself has become a sort of institution. The 
Commission has always been the key institution in the European 
machine -- its driving force. The fact that two Belgians -- 
Jean-Luc Dehaene and Wilfried Martens -- are among the 
candidates for taking over from Delors cannot leave Belgium 
indifferent. Just like it is right to stand in the way of a 
botched enlargement that would threaten the nature of the Union, 
Belgium must seize the opportunity to ensure Jacques Delors' 
succession. This would also be an effective means of 
maintaining our federalist ideals.

  [Text] Three Dutchmen have been kidnapped in Yemen, the 
Dutch Foreign Ministry has confirmed. The three worked on a 
drinking water project and were seized last Friday [25 March] 
close to the capital, Sanaa. Nothing has been heard from them 
since. 
  The kidnapping is related probably to conflicts between 
local 
tribes and the government. Yemeni tribes regularly resort to 
kidnapping to add force to their grievances against the 
government. It is not known which tribe is responsible for the 
latest kidnapping.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Wants Registration Centers </F>
for Asylum-Seekers at Borders"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- The cabinet is going to set up two 
big registration centers for asylum-seekers at the borders with 
Germany and Belgium. In the Lower Chamber last Thursday [24 
March], State Secretary of Justice Kosto stated that these 
"intake centers" will serve as "locks" for the actual reception 
centers for asylum-seekers. 
  Kosto says that foreigners who, in the Justice Department's 
opinion, do not stand a fair chance of getting asylum in the 
Netherlands, will be rapidly "sorted out" from the remaining 
asylum-seekers in the intake centers. Unlike the remaining 
centers, which come under the Ministry of Welfare, Health and 
Cultural Affairs (WVC), both registration centers will be 
controlled by the Justice Department. 
  The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and VVD [People's 
Party 
for Freedom and Democracy] factions, which still hold a 
parliamentary majority, support the proposal. The plan will be 
materialized as soon as Parliament has passed both bills 
regarding the treatment of asylum-seekers from "safe countries." 
According to Lubbers, these bills are unlikely to be ratified 
before 1995. 
  An asylum-seeker who is told in an intake center that he is 
not eligible for the procedure because he had to request asylum 
in Germany or Belgium, keeps the right to object to this 
decision with the Netherlands judge. This is in conformity with 
international obligations. Unlike now, however, the government 
will no longer see to his attendance. [passage omitted] 
  "We are faced with the fact, that our reception capacity is 
scarce, while asylum-seekers are increasingly numerous." The 
state secretary hopes that faster summary proceedings will soon 
be possible in the neighbourhood of the registration centers. 
[passage omitted] 
  During "the big asylum debate" yesterday, the government 
parties CDA and PvdA [Labor Party] were diametrically opposed to 
each other. All by himself, De Hoop Scheffer from CDA called 
for a restoration of border controls, in order to immediately 
stop foreigners who are not entitled to asylum. 
  Border controls were lifted one year ago, within the 
framework of the much-praised free movement of persons between 
the "Schengen countries." This situation cannot be reverted 
unilaterally by the Netherlands, State Secretary of European 
Affairs Dankert argued. "In addition, it would raise a huge 
political problem." [passage omitted] 
  Parliament was very critical of the asylum policy's 
implementation. As the coordinating cabinet member, Prime 
Minister Lubbers admitted that, to his own annoyance, 
discussions between the relevant departments caused very serious 
delays. "It has to do with carefulness. But there is a time 
when the prime minister says: `That's enough.' Things must be 
smoothed out. The situation has gotten out of hand."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pronk's Criticisms of Policies on </F>
Asylum-Seekers Irritate Coalition"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- Development Cooperation Minister 
Pronk earned himself the irritation of the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] and VVD [People's Party For Freedom and 
Democracy] yesterday by criticizing the cabinet's policies on 
asylum-seekers. He said the deployment of some 1,000 extra 
officers in the military police and police to monitor foreigners 
was "too ambitious." 
  "By putting in more than 1,000 extra people, the impression 
of panic is created," the minister said. He said the package of 
measures announced last week by State Secretary for Justice 
Kosto on the Evangelical Broadcasting Corporation's "Time 
Signal" news show was "unacceptable." [passage omitted] 
  According to Pronk, the current flow of asylum-seekers was a 
direct consequence of the Netherlands's decision to sign the 
Schengen Treaty. "We decided fat too lightly to bring down the 
internal borders," he said. "We did that to strengthen the 
economy, but it also had consequences for mobility. We put up 
with that because the economic gains were bigger. So it is a 
bit hypocritical to say that the borders have to be closed again 
now," Pronk said. 
  He also warned that the "mood" for good policies on 
asylum-seekers was in the process of becoming harder. "Step by 
step the mood is becoming egocentric," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Christian Democrats Drop to New Low </F>
Point in Opinion Poll With Loss of 20 Seats"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 23 March -- The CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] dropped to a record low point in the opinion polls this 
week. According to the Inter/View company, the Christian 
Democrats would get 34 seats if parliamentary elections were to 
be held now. The CDA now has 54 seats and would therefore lose 
20 seats. 
  The PvdA [Labor Party] would lose a few less seats. The 
Social Democrats would drop from 49 to 30 seats, a loss of 19. 
This means that for the first time the CDA's losses would be 
bigger than those of the PvdA. Last week the CDA experienced a 
slight recovery; the party climbed in the opinion polls from 35 
to 36 seats. The CDA reacted "with disappointment" to the 
opinion poll, because the party has partly modified its 
much-criticized pension plans. 
  The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] would 
become the second biggest party with 31 seats. At present the 
liberals have 22 seats. In previous opinion polls the VVD had 
28 seats. The increase was seen in particular as an effect of 
the comments by VVD leader Bolkestein that the flow of 
asylum-seekers should be limited. The VVD seems to be the main 
winner from the CDA's decline. 
  D66 [Democrats 66] dropped in the poll from 30 to 27 seats. 
At present the Democrats have 12 seats. A week ago Van 
Mierlo's party was still the second biggest party, but with 27 
seats it would once again be fourth biggest. The party has lost 
three seats in less than a week. The fall is explained by the 
low profile of the Democrats when it comes to serious 
discussions. The small Christian parties, SGP [Political 
Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union] and RPF 
[Reformational political Federation], together would have eight 
seats: the GPV can count on two seats, and the RPF and SGP can 
count on three each. 
  Janmaat's Center-Democrats remain at around six seats, a 
gain 
of five seats. The Socialist Party, which did strikingly well 
during the local elections, could still enter Parliament with 
three seats.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) has called for "clear signals" 
from the Chinese Government of a change in its human rights 
situation. The human rights issue was of great significance in 
Sino-German relations, the minister said after talks with her 
Chinese counterpart, Yang Xiao, in Bonn today. A "basic 
agreement" on human rights is indispensable to cooperation with 
Beijing. 
  Germany and China joined international agreements based on 
the universal applicability and indivisibility of human rights, 
the minister stressed. The interstate dialogue on human rights 
became a component of international law after the World War II. 
Thus, a dialogue of this kind is not inadmissible interference 
in a country's internal affairs. Bonn does indeed recognize the 
significance of "national and regional distinctive features as 
well as different historical, cultural, and religious 
prerequisites." However, "basic human rights criteria" are valid 
everywhere. 
  In the "very open" dialogue with the Chinese politician she 
stressed the human rights of the individual. China, on the 
other hand, has focused on "collective human rights." It is 
important that these different views be discussed openly. 
However, it would be "very desirable" if agreement could be 
reached on the "basic human rights criteria." [passage omitted] 
  Yang Xiao stressed that they were able to achieve a 
consensus 
on many issues. However, given the differences in social order 
and economic development and the different cultural 
prerequisites, it is obvious that they would also have differing 
views. Nevertheless, his country is ready to enter a dialogue 
"based on equality."

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker by </F>
Manfred Bissinger and Lutz Spenneberg; place and date not given: 
"Gestures Rather Than Calculation"] 
  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Mr. President, you were the first one 
to put the move to Berlin into practice. The government and 
Bundestag will follow suit sometime in the future. Do you think 
Germany will change once it is governed from Berlin? 
  [Weizsaecker] No, there is no Berlin policy. There is only 
a German policy, which the move might only change insofar as the 
German unification process is deepened and completed more 
quickly. 
  [DIE WOCHE] The Americans are already talking about the end 
of the Bonn Republic and the beginning of the Berlin Republic. 
They obviously want to point out a difference. Do you not see 
this difference? 
  [Weizsaecker] No. The great achievements of the Bonn 
Republic will be kept entirely. The name Bonn is associated 
with our development to become a reliable, democratic society 
internally and a predictable partner situated in the center of 
the continent for the outside world. 
  When the Americans talk about a "Berlin Republic" they are 
thinking of their own way, going from a victorious world power 
fighting against the Germans to cooperation and friendship with 
this former adversary. It was the attitude of the Berlin 
population during the 1947/48 blockade that made them first feel 
respect for the Germans. Berlin has not lost its good 
reputation in the United States. 
  It does not make any difference for our future policy. If we 
stayed in Bonn we would have to have an equally active policy in 
the east. And, just as we have learned to do in Bonn, we will 
keep realizing in Berlin that this eastern policy will only be 
successful if it is conducted in close cooperation with our 
Western neighbors, especially France. Cooperation with our 
neighbors in the East will be all the more successful if it is 
done with, or via, Paris. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Are Poland and other Eastern countries to be 
included in the European Union [EU]? 
  [Weizsaecker] As a first stage, the European Union has 
concluded association agreements with these states, opening up a 
clear perspective for later membership. Germany has been a 
driving force in this process, and quite rightly. But this does 
not mean that Germany is returning to a see-saw policy between 
West and East or that it is even trying to secure spheres of 
influence and economic monopolies in the East and southeast. 
After the end of the Cold War, we are living in a new era of 
European policy. When Jean Monnet spoke of Europe, he was not 
thinking of a rift going right through the continent. He did 
not want to allocate the name "Europe" to the Western Europeans 
alone. Rather, he meant a complete and joint Europe, such as 
the one that we solemnly included as objective and task in the 
preamble of the 1957 Treaties of Rome. The Baltic states, 
Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, and other 
nations are part of Europe just as the existing members of the 
European Union are. 
  We all have to get used to this new situation. It is in our 
German interest to get this across to our partners in the 
European Union. 
  [DIE WOCHE] But right now there are tensions with the 
French. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have made himself 
unpopular by being a bit too outspoken in the latest membership 
negotiations. These things irritate our neighbors. Problems 
like this occur as regularly as the tides. 
  [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are differences of opinion 
sometimes. This happened when the Gulf war broke out and at the 
beginning of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. In the 
GATT negotiations we held different opinions at first as well. 
But the important thing is the quality of the complete historic 
change that took place in French-German relations. Discussions 
now end with friendly agreements on a common policy. This was 
the case in the final stages of the GATT round, as well as in 
the preparations for a new policy on Bosnia. But it is the same 
as with all friendships: Tact, consideration, and understanding 
for the other's worries are absolutely necessary. In the end, 
these qualities best serve one's own interests. 
  [DIE WOCHE] The tensions between Bonn and Paris are partly 
due to a conflict we already had 10 years ago. June sees the 
50th anniversary of the allied forces' landing in Normandy. The 
Americans, British, and French will go to the Channel coast for 
this. The Germans have not been invited. How are you going to 
explain this to a young person in Europe? After half a century 
we are not even able to celebrate the victory over tyranny 
together. 
  [Weizsaecker] Back on 8 May 1985, I said that we have to 
respect the completely different fate each nation associates 
with the end of the war. Symbolic gestures of a grown 
friendship between nations are helpful, and they are all the 
more convincing the more spontaneously and naturally they come 
and the less they are the result of a well-considered 
calculation. 
  [DIE WOCHE] The past keeps catching up with us. Reaction to 
the film "Schindler's List" speaks for itself. Do we still need 
these impulses from outside to discuss the difficult German 
history? 
  [Weizsaecker] The holocaust is beyond any comprehensible 
description. I have great respect for efforts trying to 
document it. Spielberg has tried to describe individual fates. 
The director does not shy away from using the means of art, 
acting. This does not make the film a historic document, but it 
makes individual fates more tangible and comprehensible. 
  I think that we should be grateful for the film. It can 
teach us something that at least gets us near understanding the 
incomprehensible. It will always remain difficult. If we do 
not want others to keep reminding us of the past we would be 
well-advised not to suppress the past. 
  [DIE WOCHE] This is why we want to come back to the move 
from Bonn to Berlin. What is the starting point of a Berlin 
Republic? Shall it be based on traditions? Prussia perhaps? 
  [Weizsaecker] There is no Prussian political tradition that 
is relevant to the present. As you will know, Prussia came to 
an end in three different ways: formally, by the Allies at the 
end of World War II; before that, by the Papen government in 
1932; and in the view of most of the real Prussians, in 
Versailles in 1871 when the Prussian king was proclaimed German 
emperor. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Which of these opinions do you share? 
  [Weizsaecker] My family comes from Wurttemberg, not from 
Prussia. But I grew up in Berlin, and I think that the 1871 
theory makes the most sense in historic, cultural, and human 
terms. 
  Today, we can discuss Prussia quite unemotionally. I am 
pleased to hear the French president speak with interest and 
respect of the historic achievements of the great Prussian 
reformers in the early 19th century. He is not thinking of 
militarism, but of the reforms by Stein and Humboldt in the 
fields of democracy and education. He considers it a mistake of 
19th century France not to have recognized the Prussian 
qualities and learned from them at the time. When we had a 
great Prussia exhibition in Berlin 12 years ago, the 
contributions by historians from France, Britain, the United 
States, and even Poland were more positive, open-minded, and 
unbiased than the German contributions. 
  [DIE WOCHE] This is the fifth year after reunification. The 
image the Germans have abroad has not necessarily improved. 
There is increasing concern over a new German self-confidence. 
What is the reason for this? 
  [Weizsaecker] Considering our population figures, our 
comparative economic strength, and our geographical position, 
this is quite understandable. This makes it all the more 
important to clearly recognize the interests of unified Germany 
and voice them without fear. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Yet, our neighbors can easily mistake this for a 
new German nationalism. 
  [Weizsaecker] It is our task to deal with this 
misunderstanding. I remember the debate on the West's 
assistance to the eastern reform states. We Germans treated 
this with more urgency than the other Western states. Then the 
Americans, French, and English said: "If this is so important 
to you, why don't you help these states?" When we started doing 
that we were blamed for seeking monopolies for our economic 
interests in the East. In fact, the eastern reform states need 
much more assistance than Germany can give. 
  [DIE WOCHE] If a German mentions German interests, he is 
often given funny looks. The French and British talk about 
their countries' interests much more freely. We do not really 
dare do so. I suppose this has something to do with our past. 
  [Weizsaecker] As always, honesty is the best policy. The 
English especially quite often say: "If you Germans do not talk 
of your interests, this makes us all the more suspicious. Every 
country has its interests, including Germany. So, please tell 
us what your interests are." 
  [DIE WOCHE] What are the German interests? 
  [Weizsaecker] Every country is formed by its geographical 
position. Our position is: central, surrounded by new 
neighbors. An island nation starts out from a completely 
different position. 
  German interests want to overcome the employment crisis, 
conduct a long-term energy supply policy, provide open borders 
for trade, and keep the environment fit to live in. Our 
interests are stability in our country and around us, open 
borders, and contributions toward the survival of our planet. 
We cannot solve any of these problems on our own. It is our 
national interest to promote European cooperation with all 
possible means. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Unfortunately, the Germans are wary of Europe at 
the moment. 
  [Weizsaecker] I do not think so. 
  [DIE WOCHE] All opinion polls indicate that. 
  [Weizsaecker] What are the questions they put? A more 
detailed analysis shows that the Germans do not have a basic 
dislike of the European process. There is, however, opposition 
against the strict regulations of European authorities and 
councils that involve many problems for local politicians and 
some professions in agriculture, in the villages, towns, and 
laender. 
  Also, Germany lacks a large-scale open debate on Europe. We 
are controlled by a Weimar nightmare that makes us still think 
that elements of plebiscite would harm our democracy. I 
consider this to be unfounded faintheartedness. Of course, 
referendums are often exciting processes. We were quite excited 
ourselves when a referendum on Europe was held in France and two 
in Denmark. But today, people there are generally better 
informed about Europe than we Germans. Why? Because they had a 
serious and big debate about the subject before us. 
  [DIE WOCHE] They talked about Maastricht when we were 
discussing reunification. 
  [Weizsaecker] That is right. But unification of our own 
country is inseparably linked with European developments. And 
to understand what Europe is all about, many citizens are not 
content with having their say reduced to putting crosses on 
lists of parties standing for a European Parliament that still 
has very little power. 
  I certainly do not advocate replacing our representative 
democracy by a direct one. But there are sensible middle 
courses that can strengthen people's need for information and 
codetermination in the interest of the entire state. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Can Europe help us with the complicated 
questions we are facing, such as growing unemployment? 
  [Weizsaecker] By all means. We cannot do without that. At 
the moment, the unemployment rate is 12 percent in France and 10 
percent in Germany. In the OECD countries, 36 million people 
are out of work. It is no coincidence that the recent meeting 
of the seven major industrial countries in Detroit did for the 
first time not discuss foreign and security policy, nor fiscal 
or monetary problems, but unemployment. We have to get used to 
a different agenda on a national, continental, and global level. 
It is no longer strategic questions of the Cold War that have 
priority, but economic and social developments, migration, and 
the environment. The United Nations, too, must pay more 
attention to these issues. The 1945 founding fathers of the 
Security Council had an almost exclusively military definition 
of security. Today, security is jeopardized by economic 
weaknesses, hunger, social unrest, human rights violations, and 
ecological imbalances. These problems facing the coexistence of 
nations and the survival of our planet earth need to be put on 
the Security Council's agenda and must not be left to 
comparatively powerless special organizations. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Should we increase our commitment in the 
Security Council for this reason? 
  [Weizsaecker] Yes. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is it wise, though, to take on new commitments? 
  [Weizsaecker] Yes. Anybody who wants to have more 
influence, has to take on more responsibility. We do not 
qualify for a permanent seat in the Security Council by thinking 
in terms of prestige, but by presenting constructive 
suggestions. This is not idealistic noble-mindedness, but 
realizing our interests.

<F P=106> ["DPA/sav" report: "Mielke, Too, Did Not Know Anything </F>
About the Bomb"] 
  [Text] On Friday [25 March] former Stasi chief Erich 
Mielke was unexpectedly questioned as a witness in the trial 
concerning the bomb attack on the "Maison de France" [French 
cultural institute in Berlin] in August 1983. At the land court 
the 86-year-old man said that he was not informed about the 
attack beforehand. 
  The witness, who was brought to the court from prison, did 
not want to give any further information about the involvement 
of the Ministry of State Security [MfS]. Former Stasi 
Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is accused of aiding and 
abetting murder, had referred to orders which led to passing 
explosives to German Johannes Weinrich, a member of the "Carlos" 
terrorist group. Weinrich is considered to be the triggerman of 
the attack, in which one man was killed. 
<H5>  Stasi Agents Kept Silent </H5>
  So far, the court has hardly made any progress in 
questioning 
the Stasi agents. Before Mielke, Harry Dahl, former head of the 
Antiterrorism Main Department, was questioned. However, he 
suffered from a defective memory. He was able to remember only 
one detail: He did not give Voigt the order. His superior, 
Horst Franz, refused to give evidence. Dahl's deputy, Guenter 
Jaeckel, also claimed that he did not have anything to do with 
the attack. 
  Despite these meager results, the judges can also rely on 
something solid, namely on the MfS documents. They say that in 
May 1983 it was feared that the Carlos group would carry out 
attacks in order to extort the release of terrorists imprisoned 
in France. In the following months, there was talk of planned 
attacks. In June 1983 the "Maison de France" is even mentioned 
as a potential target. 
  The reports from Voigt's department prove that the Stasi was 
excellently informed about the group surrounding the 
internationally wanted terrorist Carlos. It knew of previous 
attacks by this group on the Paris-Toulouse train, the 
Paris-Lyon fast train, and the Saudi Embassy in Vienna. It knew 
Syrian liaison men and was informed about their private lives. 
<H5>  Was Syria Involved? </H5>
  On 19 August 1983 the MfS received another important message 
from Hungary, according to which a certain Al-Siba'i, a 
"would-be kamikaze" of Carlos' group, was on his way to Berlin. 
Six days later, according to the prosecution, Al-Siba'i ignited 
the bomb in the "Maison de France." For Senior Public 
Prosecutor Mehlis it is clear that "all strings came together" 
in Voigt's hands. 
  However, the trial does not just raise the question about 
the 
responsibility of the MfS. Syria, too, was involved in the bomb 
attack. Weinrich had not only a Syrian diplomatic passport, 
Damascus also supported the "Carlos group" with apartments, 
cars, and weapons. The embassies were ordered to fulfill all 
wishes of the gang. In Berlin terrorist Weinrich was cared for 
by Nabil Sharitah, a member of the Syrian Embassy and a man who 
is a mystery. 
  Even though an arrest warrant was issued for the 43-year-old 
Syrian in Germany, he gave himself up to the authorities during 
the trial. Voluntarily, as the diplomat stressed. However, 
Sharitah did not live up to his boast that he would incriminate 
Syria. After a visit by Syrian Embassy members, he cleared 
Damascus: "Syria had nothing to do with that."

superhighway checkpoint carried 2,300 (!) firearms. 
  "Wooden boxes" was tersely written on the declaration of 
goods that the driver presented. However, the German customs 
officers became suspicious and had a closer look at the 166 
boxes. They contained carbines, guns, machine guns, 
semiautomatic guns, ammunition, and parts of weapons. 
  The destination would have been a commercial firm in North 
Rhine-Westphalia. The freight was confiscated and criminal 
proceedings were instituted against the "receiver" and the truck 
driver.

<F P=106> ["vM." report: "Germany and France Want Joint `Government </F>
Program' for Europe"] 
  [Text] Paris, 24 Mar -- In Paris on Thursday [24 March], 
FRG Foreign Minister Kinkel presented his ideas for cooperation 
between Germany and France in and for the new Europe. Kinkel's 
lecture at the invitation of the "French Institute for 
International Relations" (Ifri) and the "International Liaison 
and Documentation Office" (BILD) had been on the program for 
some time. However, at a time when it is important for the 
parties involved to overcome irritations in Franco-German 
relations, the German foreign minister's appearance in Paris is 
particularly important. During his visit, Kinkel also met with 
President Mitterrand. 
  The European unification process has opened a new road to 
the 
future for Germany, Kinkel said. The overwhelming majority in 
the Bundestag and the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court 
confirmed the general conviction in Germany: "We need more and 
not less of Europe." France and Germany agree on the historic 
finding that two neighboring states in the heart of Europe that 
are so big can only exist together. "Therefore, Germany and 
France have always placed unification of Europe before going it 
alone and going special ways." Thus, the two states have become 
"Europe's pacemaker." "This will and must continue!" 
  The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold 
War, but "the whole of Europe," Foreign Minister Kinkel 
explained. Here the following "fateful questions" arise both 
for France and Germany: How can we consolidate peace? How will 
we ensure the prosperity of our peoples? How will we stand our 
ground in a global framework? For Germany the answer is clear: 
"We can only cope with this challenge in and with the European 
Union [EU]." Kinkel is certain that France's answer is the 
same. As the first issue in fact, the enlargement by Austria, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway is now at hand. "It would be foolish 
to cling to questions of voting rights now." In 1985 one had 
jointly made possible the entry of the south of Europe, now it 
is the turn of the north, he said. 
  French-German cooperation has stood the test in joint 
initiatives, such as the establishment of a European corps, the 
resumption of the "Yugoslav" negotiations, and the GATT 
negotiations. Now the two partners are faced with the further 
development of the EU: the admission of new member states, the 
reform of the European institutions, the relationship between 
deepening and enlargement. "Germany and France must maintain 
their role as a hinge in an EU that is continuing to grow. This 
is our joint future task." 
  From 1 July onward, Germany and then France will chair the 
EU. For these 12 months, the German foreign minister sees a 
German-French "presidential program" with four focal points: 
  1. The implementation of the EU treaty, starting from 
Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]. "Our joint objective is the 
convergence of our economies." Not all member states can make 
the step to the third stage of EMU at the same time. "Germany 
and France have to defend the logic of the EU treaty against all 
attempts at undermining it," Kinkel demanded. 
  2. An independent European security and defense policy as an 
answer to the security policy challenges in Europe. Here the 
future Europe also needs the security partnership with the 
United States. "Franco-German cooperation is strengthening the 
pillar of the bridge across the Atlantic." Kinkel paid tribute 
to the French efforts for NATO's decision on Sarajevo. "I see 
with satisfaction that the EU peace plan, which is based on a 
Franco-German initiative, is now developing into an 
international peace agreement, which, as I hope, will be solid 
on a long-term basis. It is an example of the power of the 
Franco-German agreement." Kinkel and French Foreign Minister 
Juppe agree on the wish to commit the CSCE member states to 
"joint action against those who disturb the peace." "The old 
thinking in terms of zones of interest is no longer acceptable. 
In the new Europe there can no longer be any room for so-called 
vital spheres of interest and for the concept of `close foreign 
countries.'" 
  3. The EU also has to strive for a more active Mediterranean 
policy. The German and the French foreign ministers want to 
"explore" the opportunities for joint initiatives. 
  4. With a joint EU policy toward the East, the reform states 
in Central and East Europe are to be taken closer "step by step 
to our community of stability." Since 1990, France and Germany 
have been striving for a joint policy toward the East. Kinkel 
mentioned the contacts with Poland as a positive example. 
Kinkel proposes a "European development corps" for the Central 
European reform states. The German foreign minister was more 
reserved regarding Russia's wishes for help: "Russia's 
integration within the world economy is only possible as Russia 
enforces the market economy at home itself." "Together with 
France," Germany wants to take the Baltic states increasingly 
closer to the EU. 
  As in his initial comments on European polices that were 
marked by German-French cooperation, Kinkel had tried before to 
dispel concerns about a disturbance of relations in an interview 
with the daily LE MONDE. The contacts between the two countries 
are "so diverse, close, and natural" that even "different points 
of view" cannot shake the "excellent bases of our relations," 
Kinkel said. Referring to Bonn's sensitiveness over preparation 
for the commemoration of the Allies' landing in Normandy, the 
foreign minister said: "I do not doubt that (after the meetings 
between de Gaulle and Adenauer in Reims and Mitterrand and Kohl 
in Verdun) French and Germans will also succeed in adequately 
commemorating the end of World War II and Germany's return to 
the community of democratic states."

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from the opening speech by Defense Minister </F>
Volker Ruehe at the "Bundeswehr and Society" forum, organized by 
WELT AM SONNTAG, in Berlin on 22 March: "Stabilization of East 
Europe is the Main Task of Alliance and Bundeswehr"] 
  [Text] The last three meetings of the WELT AM SONNTAG 
forum show the enormous speed of the developments in the 1990's. 
Those who still hope that one can soon offer a firm construct 
again, feeling a certain longing for the solid even though 
hostile world of the past, begin to understand more and more 
that this will not be the case. 
  The topic of this forum is not only a central one for the 
armed forces, but for all of German politics. The Federal 
Government and parliament now have to make difficult basic 
decisions in order to define the kind and size of the armed 
forces that Germany wants to have and keep. 
  Basically, it is not so much a quantitative than a far more 
important qualitative debate about the future of the Bundeswehr. 
  So far, we have largely taken quantitative steps because of 
the changed international situation -- the Bundeswehr will be 
reduced to 370,000 men. Now the qualitative changes must be put 
into the foreground more strongly. With the 1994 white book, 
the Federal Government has set the necessary conceptional 
framework for that. 
  When I spoke at this forum last May, the opening of the 
alliance toward the east was the most important message, and at 
that time there was no discussion at all in NATO about this 
issue. Today, the opening up to new members is the declared 
political strategy of the North Atlantic alliance. 
  For the European Union [EU] this opening up is already a 
reality. It is deepening and expanding. Austria, Finland, 
Sweden, and Norway will become new members -- several East 
European states have quite definite prospects for membership. 
This process is a desired one and must not be blocked by 
egotistical individual interests. 
The development of the EU is not just an economic event. The 
issue is a comprehensive political process, during which the 
things that belong together grow together in Europe. It is not 
a provocation if one advocates that Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
the Slovak Republic, and Poland, grow together with Europe also 
in terms of security policy. 
  I gave a speech at Charles University in Prague. There I was 
welcomed in Latin. Now tell me one German university where I 
would be welcomed in this way. For me, Prague is just as 
European as Berlin and Hamburg and Munich and Rome and Paris. 
  Our northern neighbors accept their share of responsibility 
for the stability of our continent. Opportunities for intensive 
security policy and defense policy cooperation are opening up, 
which were not possible during the times of the East-West 
conflict and the division of Europe. This becomes particularly 
obvious by the example of Sweden. For more than 90 years, 
Germany has not held any general staff meetings with Sweden. In 
the future, this will not only be a regular exercise, but there 
will also be intensive coordination regarding important 
questions of the development of our Armed Forces. 
  The decision of the Swedish Government to equip its Armed 
Forces with German Leopard tanks is or strategic quality and 
means a new opportunity for cooperation, which would have been 
completely inconceivable only a short time ago. 
  However, the EU is not just expanding toward the north, but 
also toward the east. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and 
the Slovak Republic are making clear political and economic 
progress. They have meanwhile concluded European agreements and 
are thus actively participating in European integration. We 
want to help them with consolidating democratic structures, in 
implementing a functioning social market economy, and in 
reorienting their security and defense policy. Therefore, we 
are willing to accept them as members in to the EU and to bring 
them close to the European security structures already now. 
  The complicated process of deepening and expanding the EU 
cannot be separated from the reform of the Atlantic alliance. 
European and transatlantic developments must not diverge. This 
was a central message of the NATO summit in Brussels in January 
1994. 
  Europe, which is growing together, has been recognized as an 
equal partner of the United States. The West European Union is 
strengthened as the European pillar of the alliance. In the 
future, it can rely on NATO structures and forces so that Europe 
becomes capable of strategic action and can take over more 
responsibility for the common tasks. This reduction of the 
burden on North America at the same time creates the 
preconditions for lasting involvement in and for Europe. 
  The alliance has accepted the stabilization of Central and 
East Europe as the main strategic task. As a result, it can 
fulfill two decisive political and strategic functions today and 
in the future: 
  -- First, it is the only functioning mechanism that links 
North America and Europe. 
  -- Second, it is the only institution that can create 
effective partnership between the Euro-Atlantic community on the 
one hand and Russia and the other East European states on the 
other. 
  The instrument for that is a balanced approach of 
integration 
and cooperation. NATO's "Partnership for Peace" initiative is a 
flexible mechanism with which this approach can be made more 
concrete. We can differentiate without discrimination. 
  Twelve states have already joined the "Partnership for 
Peace" 
initiative, others are on the point of doing so, including 
Russia -- which is a step of strategic importance for Europe's 
security policy. 
  Over the past 18 months I have held intensive talks with 
most 
Central and East European states. One important goal was to 
create a network of intensive relations of cooperation and to 
practically implement Europe's opening up toward the East. 
Another concern was not to fix our neighbors in the East to an 
exclusive orientation toward the West, but to encourage them to 
improve their relations with each other. 
  Of particular importance for the regional balance in East 
Europe and thus for Europe's stability as a whole is an 
independent, democratic, and economically viable Ukraine. 
However, Ukraine is in a profound crisis at the moment. 
  We need an internationally coordinated approach so that 
critical developments do not endanger European stability. This 
is the task not only of Russia and the United States regarding 
the issue of nuclear disarmament, but also of neighbor Russia in 
relations with neighbor Ukraine, of the EU in its relations with 
East Europe, and of the United States in a differentiated policy 
toward East Europe, which now sets the correct priorities. 
  The reform process in Russia is and remains the key for a 
peaceful development in East Europe. It must be successful. 
Therefore, Germany supports this process with everything it can 
provide. 
  Just because of its enormous size, Russia will always have a 
special position. However, no one can and wants to isolate the 
big power Russia. Stability in Europe can come about only with 
Russia and not against it. We need and want togetherness and 
cooperation also on military issues for safeguarding peace. 
This is the opposite of isolation and marginalization. 
  However, Russia must obtain the trust of its neighbors and 
partners primarily through its own actions. This includes 
respecting the neighbors' sovereignty and the inviolability of 
the orders. We must do everything so that Russia takes the 
right path in a difficult situation and that the wrong decisions 
are not made by the wrong forces. 
  Russia links the participation in the "Partnership for 
Peace" 
program with the expectation that NATO develops cooperation 
relations of a special quality with Russia. Russia does not 
want to be a guest in Europe, as President Yeltsin said. It 
wants to participate in solving security problems in Europe and 
wants to be occasionally included in NATO projects for 
exercises, to which I do not object. 
  In this connection, Defense Minister Grachev suggested 
explaining the new Russian military doctrine to the Nato defense 
ministers. I do not see any reason why we should not support 
this. 
  It is now important to preserve the momentum of cooperation 
and to implement it in practical steps in such a way that Russia 
is recognized as a strategic partner of NATO and can also feel 
like a partner. We must take care that the special quality of 
partnership between NATO and Russia does not strangle the 
process of integration of others in the Western institutions. 
  After the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Germany, 
further development of our defense-policy relations is of 
special importance. Therefore, together with my Russian 
colleague, I have decided to hold a joint navy exercise in the 
Baltic Sea this year, which will be followed in 1995 by a 
German-Russian command post exercise in Russia and in 1996 by a 
German-Russian maneuver in western Germany. 
  Our contribution to stability and peace demonstrates that 
Germany can be relied on as a member of the alliance and that we 
take over all necessary duties as an equal member in the 
international community. 
  However, this must also have an effect when it is necessary. 
We will never agree to opting out of military integration. The 
Federal Constitutional Court has approved this attitude twice. 
I am sure that our policy will be definitely confirmed in 
summer. Apart from that, one just has to imagine what would 
have happened internationally if we had left the AWACS planes. 
  This is true historic progress that here nations have 
irrevocably linked their fates with each other, that they have 
entered a voluntary dependence, that it is not each individual 
nation that operates its own plane but that one plane is 
operated by 12 nations. There you have one system that shows the 
core of political progress, of confidence-building after World 
War II. However, this plane must then also be flown together 
when it is necessary. 
  In order to save resources, it will be necessary that not 
everyone has his universal army, but that one either operates 
joint systems or puts them together as modules. We are holding 
talks with the Dutch to put together German and Dutch submarines 
-- a fascinating idea. 
  However, if my Dutch colleague asks me whether they will 
also 
leave port together and I tell him, on principle yes but it may 
be that I have to go to Karlsruhe first, this shows how 
untenable German positions are. 
  The international missions of the Bundeswehr are a most 
profoundly central political issue, which decides on our ability 
to join Europe and our credibility as an alliance partner. 
  German-French brigade, Eurocorps, German-U.S. corps, 
German-Dutch corps -- how are all these things going to work if 
Germany follows a special path all the time? By the way, we 
have a German commanding general in Strasbourg -- the first 
commanding general, who leads the Eurocorps, who commands 
German, French, and Belgian soldiers on French territory. This 
is one example of progress. And if one talks to the German 
soldiers in Strasboug, they say: We like walking around in 
German uniforms here much better than in some large western 
German cities. 
  Germany needs armed forces for national defense, which can 
be 
reduced in their presence and readiness for action because of 
the improved situation and can become more dependent on 
mobilization. 
  The structures for collective defense need not be fully 
fleshed out anymore in Central Europe. The preparation period 
of several weeks, which can be used militarily in the unlikely 
case of a major aggression suggests to shift operational 
training for individual units of the main defense forces to the 
period of a crisis. 
  At the same time a minimum contingent of present, quickly 
replaceable, and flexible crisis reaction forces with high 
professionality is needed, which is capable of multinational 
cooperation. 
  The requirements of national defense and the ability to 
react 
in a crisis under completely different strategic conditions 
primarily determine the presence and structure of our future 
armed forces. 
  From that we are now drawing conclusions for the reform of 
the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr's need for adjustment is great 
and requires mobility. When I see how much trouble the 7,000 
Bonn civil servants are making, who are supposed to come to 
Berlin in the course of 10 years, and I know that in the 
Bundeswehr 20,000 people must move every year, this shows where 
the mobile parts of our society are. 
  The Bundeswehr is underfinanced today. This is a sentence 
that sounds very harmless but that has effects: There is a gap 
between structure and assignment on the one hand and the 
finances that are available on the other. This gap must be 
closed. 
  We have to continue consistently with rationalization. It is 
necessary to gain financial leeway for the urgently needed 
investments, which the Bundeswehr needs for new construction. I 
have ordered corresponding studies and measures. 
  The results are summarized in a conceptional guideline for 
the development of the Bundeswehr, which I want to present to 
the Parliament and to the Defense Committee in April and to have 
it discussed on a broad basis. 
  Only at the end of this process will the overall picture of 
the future Bundeswehr become visible. Only then will it also be 
possible to make a final decision on the future size. 
  Usually, something like that is not done during an election 
year, but I believe that we owe it to the Bundeswehr to look 
beyond the election date into the future and to come to as much 
consensus as possible. 
  The Bundeswehr is proving its worth in a difficult time, it 
is mastering the challenges of the upheavals excellently. The 
criticism that is voiced occasionally is inappropriate. The 
report by the defense commissioner, which is justified in 
showing specific deficiencies, must, however, not be confused 
with a report on the general condition of the armed forces. 
  I believe that over the past years the Bundeswehr has 
adjusted to new tasks more quickly than many people expected. I 
still remember how anxiously some soldiers went on their way to 
Cambodia. And I am very proud of the achievements that our 
soldiers complied in Beledweynne in Somalia. 
  I believe that in the future, too, the Bundeswehr will 
decisively contribute to preserving Germany's ability to act and 
to function in the alliance. It is not only in Germany's 
interest that we have efficient armed forces. 
  There is no European defense without appropriate German 
armed 
forces. Nor is there a European defense without German armed 
forces that are basically wiling to do the same as the French, 
Danish, British, and Polish armed forces. I think that we will 
be able to close this one open flank, which still exists, in a 
reasonable way.
