  [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Croatian 
Government Office in Belgrade Will Deal With Practical Issues," 
published on page 9 of the 16 March issue of the Zagreb daily 
VJESNIK, correspondent Ivkica Bacic reports that Dr. Zvonimir 
Markovic, head of the Croatian Government Office, had already 
arrived in Belgrade and was scheduled to present a letter from 
his government to Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic on 23 
March, thus marking the official opening of the Croatian 
"Embassy," which will begin to operate "within days." Bacic 
notes that at present the staff consists of Dr. Markovic, Dr. 
Dusan Bilandzic, and Davor Vidis. 
  Interviewed by Bacic, Markovic describes his first 
impressions of Belgrade and expresses satisfaction that 
bilateral relations are finally improving, adding that "all 
people, here and in Croatia, must do away with narrow-mindedness 
and arrogance and realize that nobody can live in isolation from 
the world," which is "just as unnatural as the state of war." 
  Asked about the role his office is going to play, Markovic 
states: "We are not going to pursue high politics here but try 
to solve the problems of the common man. We will try to help on 
a human level." In this regard he mentions plans to establish 
communication and transportation links between Zagreb and 
Belgrade, as well as offer legal aid in solving property issues. 
Commenting on Belgrade media reaction to the opening of the 
Croatian Government Office, VJESNIK notes that all dailies and 
local television stations had reported the initial statements 
made by the Croatian representatives, with the exception of 
state television, which kept silent, and state radio, which 
mentioned Markovic's arrival only briefly, citing Croatian 
sources.

<F P=106> [Article by S.P. Stazic: "Stipac Provoked Rift in HSS"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb--The suspended members of the Croatian 
Peasants' Party [HSS], Mirko Madjor and Dr. Josip Stojanovic, 
confirmed at a news conference on Monday that the rift in the 
party that they had announced has happened. The crisis of such 
dimensions, in their words, was not triggered by them but by HSS 
President Drago Stipac and Chief Secretary Mirko Glokovic. 
  Pointing to the further violation of the bylaws, Madjor 
claims that Stipac has introduced tyranny into the HSS political 
tyranny, which is contrary to the party's traditions. Both 
Madjor and Stojanovic assert that a recent meeting of the HSS 
Executive Committee was not conducted according to the bylaws, 
and that Madjor, because of a telephone threat, was prevented 
from participating in the meeting. 
  Following all of this, and especially following the Stipac 
interview in SRPSKI GLASNIK in which he expressed his 
concurrence that Croatia become a federation and a national 
state of the Croat and Serb peoples, Madjor states that what is 
at issue in the HSS is not just a conflict over organizational, 
personnel, and financial issues, but a conflict of the political 
and ideological views of Stupac and a group of people that 
surrounds him as well as the "Kasinska" group. 
  Madjor and Stojanovic are also convinced that the public 
will 
soon find out on whose account and in whose interest Stipac set 
off the conflict in the HSS. In a rather long speech, Ante 
Babic, an HSS member and a minister plenipotentiary, as well as 
head of the Information Section in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, gave his views, or rather aired the dirty linen of the 
HSS publicly. That is to say, Babic had been declared a "mole of 
the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]" by some HSS Presidency 
members. 
  Defending himself, Babic stated that the epithet of "HDZ 
mole" would be more suitable for Drago Stipac because, "I have 
heard him say innumerable times that he had agreed precisely on 
this with President Tudjman." 
  Babic said of Stipac that he is a "very narrow-minded person 
who is not even capable of managing a local community, not to 
mention the HSS." Stating that Dr. Tihomir Radja, a member of 
the HSS Presidency, is close to Liberal circles, Babic informed 
Stipac that it is precisely Radja who wanted to carry out a coup 
last year in the HSS while he, as a president of the party, was 
on a visit to Canada, and that Madjor and Stojanovic prevented 
Radja from doing so. Babic at the end warned Drago Stipac that, 
now that he no longer has people like Madjor and Stojanovic who 
are loyal to him, Radja and the "present leadership of the HSS" 
will remove him from his position as head of the party.

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "The Commissars Are Restoring </F>
Order"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Financial Rescue of the Banks </H5>
  The financial rescue of Croatian banks is an old term 
usually 
used, and in fact abused in the past, to refer to attempts to 
restore the Croatian banks to health. Financial rescue of the 
banks was referred to for a long time as one of the key moves, 
once inflation was shattered, in the approach to restructuring 
and restoring the entire Croatian economy to health, and it was 
also said that the success of the stabilization program would 
depend greatly on success in rescuing the banks. The first 
results were followed immediately by the first significant 
problems of the stabilization program. One of them was division 
of the banks into those which can provisionally be said to be 
operating normally and those which have problems with liquidity, 
and some even with insolvency. While liquidity is corrected with 
short-term solutions, the problem of insolvency is far more 
difficult, because this means that the value of debt exceeds the 
value of property, which is an altogether sufficient reason for 
the bank's bankruptcy. Because there is a reluctance to conduct 
bankruptcy proceedings of banks because of what is usually 
referred to as the domino effect, i.e., an excessively great 
influence on economic events because of connections between the 
banks and their customers, the effort is usually made to restore 
the bank to health, liquidity, and normal operation, which as a 
rule means paying its debts. Following an agreement in one of 
its meetings to undertake financial rescue, which is a major 
decision, the Croatian Government has taken specific steps. Back 
in January the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] sent its 
representatives, referred to in the press as commissars, to the 
Bank of Split, which is first on the list for financial rescue. 
The commissars are overseeing the operation of the Bank of 
Split, monitoring its liquidity, and sending in a report on this 
to the NBH; that in turn is to be the basis for defining 
precisely the situation in the bank, for prescribing the 
therapy, and, most interestingly, for fixing the amount of money 
the state must furnish to steer the bank toward normal operation. 
<H5>  Liquidation as a Last Resort </H5>
  In addition to the Bank of Split, the Bank of Slavonia is 
also to be rescued in the first round, and after them come the 
Bank of Rijeka and the Bank of Istria, and, it is assumed, the 
Bank of Zupanja as well. The Government of the RH [Republic of 
Croatia] seems to have taken the problem of rescuing the banks 
quite seriously. Following the agreement, there will be 
regulations governing the conduct of the rescue, and soon the 
Law on Rescue of the Banks should be presented in public, and 
the government will form a professional body, the Agency for 
Rescue of the Banks, consisting of experts, most probably from 
the National Bank of Croatia and the finance ministry, who will 
conduct and monitor the rescue of the banks. The greatest 
attention, but also debate, will be aroused by the amount of 
money necessary to carry out the rescue of the banks. According 
to the first unofficial estimates, this will be some 200 million 
German marks [DM], and the final amount will be made public 
soon, because it will be planned in the new proposal of the 
state budget which the finance ministry is preparing for the 
March session of the Sabor [Croatian parliament]. This time, 
even representatives of the government have been very clear in 
statements that the rescue of the banks will be paid for by 
taxpayers, and that is why Dr. Zoran Jasic, finance minister, 
has declared: "We will stick firmly by the principle that 
whoever receives money from the state must also render an 
account to the state." This statement sounds good, but the 
question is how it will look in practice. 
  Because government expenditure is a topic that is always 
interesting, at least to the public and taxpayers from whose 
pocket everything is financed, we can expect fierce debates over 
the budget, because the deputies in the last debate threatened 
that the budget would no longer squeeze through. The item of the 
outlay for rescue of the banks will certainly be "attacked" not 
only because of the amount, but also because of the situation in 
certain banks, which are to be rescued because of scandals that 
have befallen them and because of ties to politics. The Bank of 
Split will be called to account ahead of all the others. 
  The war is given as the reason for the problematical 
business 
operation of these banks, and these are regional banks. The Bank 
of Split encountered problems because of TLM [Light Metal 
Factory] and certain other customers, the Bank of Slavonia 
follows agriculture, which has major problems, the Bank of 
Istria, has, as they say, paid the price of poor tourist 
seasons, and the Bank of Rijeka is closely tied to shipbuilding. 
To some extent, of course, all these reasons are justified, but 
it is certain that the experts will have bad business moves of 
the banks to investigate as well. Experts say that when the 
results are totaled and assessments made, the extreme measures 
will include even liquidation of the bank. There has been a 
great deal of debate about that problem up to now, because 
mainly the line was taken that it is almost impossible to 
liquidate a bank. Recently, that possibility is not being 
discounted, and it is usually said that it comes into account if 
the figures show that it is necessary. However, the banks and 
the economy are so intertwined, and in the specific case there 
is also a political connotation, so that the possibility of 
liquidation is almost precluded. 
<H5>  And Personnel Changes </H5>
  In the banks that will be rescued there are differing 
estimates of how much money is needed, but they all say that 
they can hardly wait for the rescue to begin. Frane Mitrovic, 
director of the Bank of Split, has said in the press that 
customers owe the bank more than DM150 million. "The Bank of 
Split, according to our estimate, needs DM35 million so that we 
can do business normally. If TLM repaid us its debt of some DM40 
million, everything would be fine," Mitrovic said. 
  In the Bank of Slavonia they say that they have already 
begun 
rescue of the bank through rescue of customers. They have 
initiated several bankruptcies of delinquent customers and in 
this way cleared up certain uncollected claims, and some they 
have solved by buying shares from the firm with the money owed 
the bank. 
  An internal reorganization of the bank has already been 
carried out, and the size of the labor force has been reduced. 
Although they do not want to make estimates of how much money is 
needed for the rescue, Ivo Markotic, the bank's director, says 
that they have DM177 million in outstanding loans which they 
have not collected and which they will not be able to collect. 
Markotic explains this situation in terms of problems in 
agriculture, where they have the most uncollected claims, 
because the government is not paying the rebate on interest in 
agriculture, they are not paying creditors, and the entire 
burden falls on the banks. The problem of the Bank of Rijeka is 
the illiquidity of shipbuilding, and the people in the bank say 
that $40-50 million would save them. They agree with the 
government that the customers should be rescued in order to 
restore the banks to health. An auditor, they say at the bank, 
has examined the bank's operation and seen that the assets are 
twice the basic capital, so that the bank is sound, and some of 
the experts concur in that. 
  Aside from the measures mentioned, government officials have 
also announced possible personnel changes in the bank and 
appointment of commissars who will monitor the bank's business. 
This view was immediately attacked as such, but in the 
government department they are clear--because they are putting 
up the money, they want control over the bank's operation. 
Before that, it was reported, but never confirmed, that the 
reason for such decisions, but also the stricter measures of the 
NBH, was one bank on the list for rescue which received some of 
the money for rescue and immediately loaned it out to 
problematical customers. Whether it is specifically because of 
that or in order to head off events that might be similar, the 
NBH has reacted with a press release in which it said: "People 
seem to expect from the announced rescue of the banks that there 
will be abundant coverage even for unreasonable undertaking of 
problematical loans, that is, for losses and shortage of money 
resulting from a decision of the banks themselves, not from 
objective circumstances." 
<H5>  A Crash Effort To Reduce the Debt </H5>
  The government is entering upon rescue of the banks 
cautiously, because it already has quite a bit of experience in 
intervention and aid to the banks. This can be seen with 
particular clarity in the example of old foreign exchange 
savings. The state took up as public debt about DM5 billion of 
old foreign exchange savings in order to take the burden off the 
banks and help them survive. When the government was late in 
paying the interest which the banks were supposed to pay to the 
depositors, the banks unhesitatingly called the government to 
account, viewing the problem of old foreign exchange savings as 
exclusively a problem of the government. The bankers never 
replied as to the basis for their feeling that they have been 
absolved of this problem, when it is well-known that when old 
foreign exchange savings were taken over, this also cleared up 
some of the poor assets and loans of the banks, for which no 
bill was ever presented to them. Even though the public debt has 
been reduced by DM4.2 billion because of the purchase of shares, 
housing loans, and the so-called manager credits, the present 
assessment is that this is too large a burden for the 
government, because the first installment comes due next year, 
and the government is barely able to pay interest on the old 
foreign exchange savings, and even then it is doing so late. 
That is why it was decided to undertake a great crash effort to 
reduce the public debt by allowing the purchase of enterprise 
stock with old foreign exchange savings, and this is now being 
done. 
  There is an offer at the moment to sell more than DM1.2 
billion of enterprise stock which individuals can buy with old 
foreign exchange savings. There is some question what will come 
of this, but it is clear that it is difficult to get cash for 
the stock of even the best firms, and the purchase with "paper," 
anathematized at one time, is now favored. Other problems are 
also arising here, because the banks have also become owners of 
about DM1 billion in enterprise stock in the transformation, and 
it is being asked ever more frequently why the banks are not 
selling enterprise stock in order to repair their liquidity and 
operation? Illiquidity, especially of the major banks like the 
Bank of Zagreb, could cause problems for the entire economy and 
the stabilization program, because in order to repair its 
liquidity, the bank has lowered the exchange rate of foreign 
currencies, thereby worsening the already difficult position of 
exporters. It is the large banks, the Bank of Zagreb and the 
Privredna Banka [Business Bank], that have the largest share in 
the equity of firms, and they are the only ones of the 43 
registered banks in Croatia that are included among the 500 
largest banks in the world. 
<H5>  And Political Scandals </H5>
  Privredna Banka is covering 1.5 billion of Croatia's foreign 
debt, which amounts to 2.7 billion, and its customers are the 
largest giants in Croatia, its director is a member of the 
incumbent party and a parliamentary deputy, and the Bank of 
Zagreb has one-fourth of the savings deposits of individuals, 
and when all that is taken into account, it is clear that they 
dictate many things in economic policy. What is more, along with 
the Bank of Split, Privredna Banka has already been involved in 
scandals. According to the speculation and rumors in the 
corridor, Privredna Banka will reportedly be taking over Nama. 
All of this postpones solutions to some extent, because an 
essential precondition for success of the banking system is a 
defined ownership structure in which the state has no great 
share. The interlocking between the banks and enterprises 
operating at a loss and the quasi-ownership structure, which is 
the situation in the majority of banks established in the former 
system, distort views of the market and business operation, 
which means confidence in the banks, which is the foundation for 
successful banking, is constantly being put to the test. It was 
foreseen even earlier that certain banks would be rescued with 
large bond issues, i.e., a kind of swap (exchange) of the shares 
of large firms which are the customers, but also the owners, of 
the bank, for the shares of the banks under government 
guardianship, which would take care of what up to now has been 
the incestuous relations between the banks and their debtors, 
who were also their owners, and would finally establish a normal 
ownership relation in which the creditors would have the last 
word. 
  Financial rescue of the banks can be carried out only by the 
government, but this ought to be done with a program, and if in 
that process the government is to increase its share in 
ownership of the banks, it should also divest itself of that by 
selling it, because the banks must be free of the government, 
but the central bank ought to have oversight over the business 
operation of the banks because of their importance.

<F P=106> [Article by Slavica Lukic: "`Mr. Valentic, No More Is </F>
Possible!'"] 
  [Text] Zagreb--"Mr. Valentic, you seem to have fallen in 
love with the fact of having proven to the world that you can 
stabilize the Croatian dinar. That is fine, but your economy is 
coming apart--the strings have been tightened too much, no more 
is possible." This is how Croatian businessmen in the Zagreb 
region, specifically those who export their products, talked to 
Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and the competent minister, along 
with representatives of the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] in 
the meeting organized in Zagreb on Tuesday by the Croatian 
Chamber of Commerce. 
  Some 50 businessmen in the state and private sectors were 
straightforward, frank, and at times temperamental in expounding 
to Valentic how they are managing to do business within the 
framework of his stabilization program. The list of problems 
pinching them in conduct of their business is lengthy. The 
businessmen were unanimous in letting Valentic know that the low 
rate of foreign exchange is causing them the greatest losses in 
doing business with foreign countries. So that they might do 
business with the outside world successfully, the businessmen 
want the exchange rate to be at least 4,000 dinars for 1 German 
mark [DM], because a lower rate, in their experience, 
jeopardizes not only the operation of their firms, but indeed 
the entire government program. 
<H5>  Tax Evasion </H5>
  Ante Pesa, director of the firm Mega, cited the example of 
his firm, which has superb technology, but still cannot cover 
operating costs because of the low exchange rate of the mark. He 
reproaches Valentic for having wanted to achieve many objectives 
all at once with his program, in spite of the small market and 
the low purchasing power of our public: stabilization of the 
dinar and growth of production, and he warned him that if the 
unrealistic exchange rate is maintained, we will experience 
complete economic collapse instead of the goals that were 
planned. Pesa therefore proposes an exchange rate of 5,000 
dinars per mark and a slow rate of inflation that would 
stimulate production. Marko Zupan, representative of Export 
Drva, reminded Valentic that a firm must meet its obligations to 
the budget every 15 days, while it must wait as long as two 
months for money it earns through sales abroad. And while the 
NBH and commercial banks are making charges against one another 
because of difficulties in making payments, the firm must borrow 
money even at an interest rate of 10 percent to support its 
regular business operation. The businessmen call upon the banks 
in future to pay them money collected 24 hours after the money 
is credited to the account. 
  Ante Kljajic of the firm Unitas blames the NBH for having 
created a shortage of dinars artificially, thereby also causing 
a drop in the exchange rate, because there are no clear records 
of the money supply. He proposes that the operation of firms 
which have uncollected claims from the other republics of the 
former Yugoslavia be given relief through collection of those 
claims from those Croatian firms which have debts to the other 
republics, and later the government, when relations with the 
other states are normalized, would settle this through bilateral 
treaties. He also said that government-owned firms are carrying 
the heaviest burden of appropriations for the budget, while the 
private firms are evading taxes. He publicly asked the president 
of the city chamber of commerce how many private firms in Zagreb 
have been shut down because of tax evasion? 
  Zdenko Pervan, representative of Almerija, a leather and 
footwear factory, asked the prime minister why the competent 
government departments are allowing 2 million pairs of shoes to 
enter Croatia through smuggling channels every year without 
customs duties or tax, with a large amount of this being sold at 
booths in open-air markets under the very eyes of the Financial 
Police? Unless the government controls smuggling channels for 
distribution and sale, the Croatian economy, Pervan says, will 
quickly turn into a speculative economy. For all these reasons, 
production in Croatia is dropping, as the statistics show. In 
1993, production was on the average 5.9 percent below 1992, and 
in last December alone that drop was all of 11.9 percent. The 
businessmen warn the government of a drop in exports as well: In 
January of this year, they were down 27 percent from January of 
last year. 
<H5>  Financial Rescue of the Banks </H5>
  Nikica Valentic thanked the businessmen several times for 
their frankness and promised that the government would do 
everything to guarantee them market-oriented conditions for the 
conduct of their business, but he stuck to the view that he will 
not yield to demands that jeopardize the basic goal of the 
government economic program -- stabilization of the Croatian 
currency. The alternative to that goal, Valentic said, is 
uncontrolled printing of money and financial chaos. According to 
the prime minister's promise, the government will try to ease 
the troubles of the businessmen through numerous measures on a 
smaller scale. According to the government decree, as of 1 April 
the maximum interest rate must not exceed 50 percent, and all 
the conditions for the conduct of business will be known before 
the summer. Valentic will request from the NBH the clearest 
possible monetary production for the coming period in order to 
put an end to the constant sliding of the exchange rate. In the 
coming period, the government will try to restore the banks to 
health, which is a precondition for restoring the health of the 
entire economy. The government plans to set aside DM70 million 
in cash and DM50 million in bonds from this year's budget for 
financial rescue of the banks. 
  The government will also provide an injection of money for 
shipbuilding, DM500 million will be furnished for spring 
planting, the government will also help preparation for the 
coming tourist season, and it was announced that construction is 
being invigorated. Over the next 10 years, in Croatia, according 
to Valentic, 30,000 new housing units are to be built. The 
government will take extreme measures to speed up the 
privatization of large government-owned firms, but the strongest 
light of hope for the Croatian economy is coming from 
international financial institutions. According to the prime 
minister's promise, by the end of this month Croatia will know 
how much aid it will get from international financial 
institutions. There are prospects of a loan of $500 million, and 
Valentic is issuing firm guarantees that not a single dollar 
will go for government expenditure, but all will go for the 
infrastructure and investments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, mayor of Osijek and </F>
vice chairman of Croatian Social-Liberal Party, by Bojan Divjak; 
place and date not given: "They Listen to Me More in Washington 
and Bonn Than in Osijek!"] 
  [Text] It is interesting that I have much better 
ratings at the State Department and in Bonn... than I do at 
home. I know that no prophet is welcome in his own house, but I 
must admit that I am surprised by the amount of hatred that 
spills forth upon each of my absences from the city. At the same 
time, the president of the republic and the people at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they know exactly 
what I am doing, that I do not do anything privately. 
  Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, the mayor of Osijek and the vice 
chairman of the Croatian Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], has been a 
focal point of interest by the Croatian political public for 
some time now. In recent weeks, however, this has been not 
because of his political virtues or shortcomings, his good or 
bad moves, but rather because he and his city government have 
been forced to move out of their previous office space in their 
own city. The conflict with the zupanija government, headed by 
Branimir Glavas, the zupan of Osijek-Baranja Zupanija, 
culminated in arbitration by the government of the Republic of 
Croatia, which ruled in favor of the zupanija government. In an 
interview which he himself called candid, he talks openly about 
this fight for office space for municipal authorities, but also 
about his frequent travels abroad, because of which he has often 
been targeted by no small number of critics from the ranks of 
the ruling party, and about the latest clashes within his own 
party. 
  [Divjak] In the so-called fight with the zupanija 
government, 
you lost "on points," through the judge's decision. There was no 
knockout, but from the beginning you had little, practically no 
chance of winning. Why then did you even contest the issue? 
  [Kramaric] I see this as a candid interview, where there is 
trust between us, and I believe in your good intentions, while I 
think that you believe in mine as well. You yourself have said 
that this was a so-called fight and I do not want to speak in 
terms of winners or losers. It even seems to me that if one 
analyzes some of my actions, I have continuously tried to avoid 
any conflict, because I am not a contentious person by nature, 
at least not in politics. 
<H5>  No Cause for Feeling Triumphant </H5>
  If there was some program of mine as a person that 
characterized the elections in this region in 1993, it was a 
story of cooperation. And I think that I have consistently 
represented this story, not only during the elections, but also 
when we assumed power in May 1993; I continually spoke of 
patience because I wanted to reach an agreement that would 
satisfy both sides. If we examine the genesis of what happened 
10 days ago, we arrive at a situation where we must reveal 
certain stories and certain details that should perhaps be 
forgotten. Quite simply, the situation is this. I felt that in a 
certain fight I did not have the necessary support that I should 
have received from certain institutions to keep from ending up 
in a position where someone, as you say, would be knocked out 
and someone else would triumph. I took one step that was by no 
means easy. I would call that the three hardest days of my life. 
I made a decision that can be called this or that, that can even 
be considered anti-city, that could go down as a bad decision, 
but that is a political assessment. I considered that I was not 
acting as poorly as some might interpret, and I wanted to create 
the preconditions for the city government to finally be able to 
do the things that it was entrusted to do in the elections. 
  Nearly a year has passed since the elections, but the 
preconditions for achieving a real demarcation between the 
authorities and the competences of local self-rule, the zupanija 
and city governments, have not been created. There are plenty of 
these unclarified areas here, so to speak, and it is not easy to 
be prudent and rational. It could easily happen that if the next 
elections are won by some other party that has thwarted our 
efforts right now, it would then accuse us of not having fought 
for enough self-rule. That is politics. Time will tell whether I 
have made a mistake, but I think that no one has any cause for 
feeling triumphant. 
  [Divjak] Nevertheless, the city government has been expelled 
from the center of the city, it has gone to the old heart of the 
city, which is the former heart, but today there is nothing left 
of that? 
  [Kramaric] We can talk in terms of serious frivolity. For 
the 
city, it could seemingly turn out to be a bad move, it could 
turn out to be a good move. If we support the policentric 
development of Croatia, then there is no reason not to support 
the policentric development of Osijek. Perhaps our return to the 
old heart of the city, where city hall used to stand, will help 
to bridge the gap that exists between the three parts of Osijek. 
Perhaps that will not be so bad either, as it rightly appears 
today. 
  [Divjak] What is Osijek actually--a city or the capital of a 
zupanija? 
  [Kramaric] I always see Osijek as a city, and I am the 
spokesman for a certain civic element in this city. You have the 
impression that cities that are also zupanija capitals are in 
some sense also penalized, placed in a position where there are 
two powerful people acting in one place, if I may say that in 
this case. But I think that there is room for both and that time 
will tell in this regard as well. Everyone should deal with his 
own problems and accept the situation as it is. 
  [Divjak] Of the two powerful people of whom you speak, one 
was not at all gentle in describing you, not choosing words.... 
  [Kramaric] I will say this--my study of philosophy has 
taught 
me tranquility. I have always said, I love the media: If there 
are disagreements, then they are conceptual in nature, not 
personal. I can disagree with some concept, be opposed to it, 
but I cannot be against a person because my nature does not 
permit it. I am not structured for that and you cannot hear 
harsh words from me. 
  [Divjak] Charges are often leveled concerning your travels. 
To what extent is there any real, general benefit from them, and 
to what extent is there personal benefit, as is charged? For 
example, you recently spent 10 days in the United States. 
<H5>  Clinton's Invitation </H5>
  [Kramaric] Actually, I have sometimes wondered whence and 
for 
what reason such odium has arisen, even among the public, 
concerning each of my trips. I do travel on business, I do not 
ask anyone to invite me, and I do think that my activities 
before and during the war created a certain image of me, of the 
city, of the political option that I advocate, in the world at 
large. I think that the image that I have created and conveyed 
is never harmful to Croatia; on the contrary, that it displays 
certain other colors and most often that is the motivation 
behind certain invitations that I receive and that I often must 
carry out, around 80 percent of them. There really are a lot of 
them. 
  But the invitation from the U.S. Congress and President 
Clinton, to attend a certain event that for us Europeans, and 
especially Croats, has an almost metaphysical appeal in the 
sense that you are attending a "national breakfast," a prayer 
meeting, which did not last only one day. Congressman Wolf says, 
"We want to hear your story too." This is an opportunity for you 
to meet with a number of very important and influential U.S. 
politicians, and if you want to change your image, then you must 
tell a story and someone must want to hear that story. It is 
better for us to talk than for there to exist an entire series 
of prejudices and stereotypes about us, which unfortunately do 
exist. We are a nation whose history has been disputed, about 
whose history others are unaware. If you get the opportunity to 
interpret this disputed history, to show our truth to those 
people who make the decisions, then that is a big thing. And 
Kramaric uses these trips precisely for that purpose. 
  It is interesting that I have a much higher rating at the 
State Department, in Bonn, or elsewhere far beyond our borders, 
than I have at home. I know that no one is a prophet in his own 
house, but I must admit that I am surprised by the amount of 
hatred that spills forth upon each of my absences from the city. 
When it comes down to it, I could be very private and say that I 
have a son who is of the age when he requires his father's 
presence, that I have an obligation to him. It is clearly not 
simple. There you come into contact with people who are clearly 
not well-disposed toward us, who know how to raise very perverse 
questions, and you have to be very skillful to defend something 
known as Croatian politics and the Croatian situation. 
  At the same time, the president of the republic and the 
people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they 
know exactly what I am doing, that I do not do anything 
privately. This is delicate work, which often lands you in 
delicate situations that it is definitely not easy to get out 
of, and it seems to me that I have done a good job. It is not up 
to me to make that assessment, but if you have direct contact 
with a man named Reismueller, who is a difficult person and does 
not talk to just anyone, if he wants to hear my assessments and 
is interested in what I think about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if I can express that opinion elsewhere 
as well, then you have to respect these in no sense easy efforts 
that you make up your mind to do as a person. 
  [Divjak] During your trip, you met with James Baker, who 
today is increasingly feeling remorse for what the West has done 
in the former Yugoslavia. Does he really understand what he did 
in June 1991 in Belgrade? 
  [Kramaric] You know, perhaps Baker has not evolved as much 
as 
we would like him to, and he still has a very negative attitude 
toward the Croatian position regarding Bosnia. I met with Baker 
together with, among others, representatives of Romania, 
Bulgaria, and Hungary. While the Bulgarians and Romanians were 
euphoric when discussing Baker's visits in 1990 and 1991, I had 
the good fortune to observe and say to him that we in Croatia do 
not share this enthusiasm and that in fact we regard his visit 
to Belgrade in June 1991 as a green light for all the horrors 
and calamities that happened after that. 
  Naturally, no one said that he imagined that what he did at 
the time would have such consequences, but it did, and in any 
event Baker has heard that now. That much is clear to him now, 
but there is still an awareness that tries to equate the 
aggressor and the victim and that must be told that this is a 
classic imperialist, ideological, colonial war, a war for 
territory. Anything else is an effort to justify the moral 
bankruptcy of 1991 and 1992, when this could have been 
prevented. And everything is being repeated in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian entry into Sarajevo is the 
definitive fall of Yalta, with the West losing 400 km of its 
territory and the East gaining it. A weak Russia is dictating 
policy while the West is wavering again. This is an 
indiscretion, this failure to understand that the East is 
approaching by very quick steps is a grave danger. 
  [Divjak] Let us return to the domestic scene. What is 
happening to you in your party, Mr. HSLS vice chairman? 
  [Kramaric] In any party, especially a party that is on a 
certain upswing, that wants to capture as much political room as 
possible, it is inevitable that there will be certain 
disagreements. I am a linguist by profession, and one of the 
first rules of linguistics is that disagreement is a condition 
of reaching agreement. That is the context in which I consider 
the response to your question. There must be certain differences 
in order to achieve any agreement. 
  [Divjak] What is the essence of the disagreement? 
  [Kramaric] It is very hard to come from Zagreb, Split, 
Rijeka, Osijek, Cakovac, Varazdin, Koprivnica, Zadar, Sibenik; 
you do not have the same views on some problems. This war, the 
extremely motley quality of Croatia, heightened by these wartime 
events, has slowly clouded our views. Something seems completely 
normal from Zagreb's perspective, while from the perspective of 
Osijek or Zadar-Sibenik it has a different look to it. I think 
that fundamental disagreement should be sought here. Second, you 
have patient and impatient people in any party. 
  A certain number of people in the HSLS may think that power 
comes rolling by and you only have to bend over and pick it up. 
I personally do not think that power is that weak, that it is 
served up on a platter. On the contrary, I would like for the 
political scene in Croatia to be stabilized and that one party 
no longer receive more than 50 percent of the votes, that a 
coalition-based, cooperative relationship be the foundation of 
the future Croatia, both in the Assembly and in the government, 
that we be forced to talk to each other and eliminate the amount 
of animosity that exists. Governmental authority must be a 
category of responsibility, not of strength. Sometimes my 
colleagues on the city council tell me that they have the 
impression that I am afraid of something, and I am in fact 
afraid because I make decisions that could hurt someone, but I 
do not want to hurt anyone. This principle of responsibility is 
my fundamental principle, which guides me when I make decisions. 
<H5>  Liberal Consensus </H5>
  [Divjak] To what extent is that the majority principle in 
your party? 
  [Kramaric] I hope that this will be well-emphasized here. 
Although I am vice chairman, I am not very involved in making 
important decisions on the party level. Are you commenting on 
my, shall we say, indecision about what to do in the future? I 
have not made being an Assembly deputy my profession, I have 
retained my faculty position, and ultimately I am the mayor. 
Although--and I can say this now--I grudgingly agreed to run for 
office. At first I did not expect to win, I thought I was 
lending my name to the liberals' impetus. But there was a big, I 
would even say excessive, victory by the HSLS on the city level, 
I succumbed to persuasion by people who said that I had to 
assume power, although even then I thought differently, and 
organize my life in the sense of working in the party, in the 
Assembly, and at the university. 
  Thus, I am in a position to marginalize myself in relation 
to 
creating strategic projects in my own party, by my own will. But 
I am satisfied with the work of the Grand Council, where 
liberals from all over Croatia come together, and those 
differences that emerged previously now emerge only in public. 
And that does not have to be a bad thing. For now, it seems to 
me that for certain views there are mild misunderstandings. 
Second, many people forget the "S" in the name of the party, 
which has a Christian democratic connotation, which shows that 
the liberals are aware of the situation in which Croatia finds 
itself. Not only because of the war, but also because of the 
Bolshevik legacy that has left behind a number of social 
problems that we would like to solve in a liberal fashion, but 
with the very refined, Christian component of justice and 
awareness of all hardships. Some people might say that this is a 
contradiction, but I would say that it is an oxymoron, and I 
like oxymorons. 
  [Divjak] Is it possible for us to speak of some leading 
faction in the party? Whose positions are the strongest? 
  [Kramaric] I think that there is a general consensus among 
all so-called factions on key issues. I try to be a person who 
will be good with everyone and have understanding for everyone. 
If you really want to know, I am closest to the government of 
Gotovac, if I may say so and reveal that. There is a whole 
series of sensible people there with whom we mostly agree, from 
Budisa, Rados, and Granic to Butkovic.... 
  [Divjak] You have listed almost everyone. With whom do you 
not agree? 
  [Kramaric] I think that there are some, I might call them 
techno-managerial components of the liberals whom I personally 
feel are somewhat impatient and do not see the motley nature of 
Croatia.... 
  [Divjak] Whom do you mean concretely, Fizulic? 
  [Kramaric] Well, yes. Personally, I do not have poor 
relations with Mr. Fizulic, but a few times he has made some 
decisions--we said that we would be candid--that do not hold up. 
Let there be no misunderstanding--he does not have a bad 
concept, but he does not always do the best job in harmonizing 
this concept with every Croatian concept. That is my most 
precise response. 
<H5>  President for 21st Century </H5>
  [Divjak] Could the same thing that happened to the IDS 
[Istrian Democratic Assembly] in Pula also happen to the HSLS in 
May at the electoral assembly in Osijek? 
  [Kramaric] I think that we are in any event a serious party, 
and if such signs were to appear then we would know how to reach 
a gentlemen's agreement. To be precise, so you do not catch me, 
I think that it cannot happen, but if there were certain 
tendencies--and I say this only in the conditional--then we 
would know how to resolve them through a gentlemen's agreement, 
without amusing the Croatian public in that way. 
  [Divjak] Is Drazen Budisa remaining at the head of the 
liberals? 
  [Kramaric] I think that he is. I must repeat this--I welcome 
his candidacy as party chairman with sincere satisfaction. He is 
a person, politician, and friend for whom I feel exceptional 
esteem and with whom I have not had a single important 
disagreement thus far. He is necessary to both the liberals and 
Croatia, and he must complete the cycle that began with him. 
That is good, whereby we too are aware of what we have 
conditionally called the policy of a new course, that what 
applied yesterday does not apply today. That there will be 
adjustments in some of our positions toward current events, but 
there will be no abandonment of the fundamental premises. 
  [Divjak] How then does this fit in with the appearance of 
Zlatko Kramaric in the post of HSLS chairman for the 21st 
century, and does he in fact want to be that? 
  [Kramaric] That should not be ruled out either. It is 
possible that our turn will come in that regard if I continue to 
offer good answers, good solutions in the concrete situation. 
There is no reason for me not to assume that honor and 
obligation. I am not running away from that, but I think that 
this time, the 20th century and perhaps the 21st century as 
well, if it does not turn out that I am giving Budisa a short 
life span, must end with him. But anything is possible in the 
21st century. 
  [Divjak] Does that mean that your concept of understanding 
could have a place on the Croatian political scene? 
  [Kramaric] Once this time of triumph and tragedy that has 
happened to us as a nation is over, people will have to start 
behaving reasonably. We have paid dearly for a big school, and 
we must draw some lessons from it. I think that the time is 
coming for rational behavior, for the concept of cooperation, a 
concept in which you do not regard political adversaries as 
enemies, that the time of hatred is over. Because this amount of 
hatred can be our undoing; I have always said that our political 
conception will be drawn into question when we respond to the 
hatred of others with hatred of our own. But unfortunately it 
seems to me that on the current Croatian political scene, now 
that we have lost our enemies, we are looking for new enemies, 
that we are looking for them in our very midst, and that is what 
distresses me very much and why I think that it is not good for 
the future of Croatia.

<F P=106> [Article by B.J. Oreb: "Zagreb News Conference by Croatian </F>
Electric Power Industry: Dalmatia Without Electric Woes"] 
  [Text] Work on completing the 110-kilovolt "island 
link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing 
according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is 
expected in July; construction of the thermoelectric power plant 
in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on schedule, and the first 
generator, with 26 megawatts of power, will be synchronized to 
the network on the 17th of this month. 
  Zagreb--Extensive work is expected in Dalmatia and Istria on 
reviving and reconstructing the electric power network, which is 
both in ruins and in disrepair. This was noted at a press 
conference by the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP], at 
which a new program for revitalizing electric power 
installations in the coastal region of Croatia was presented. 
The "Plan to Develop the Electric Power Network of Underwater 
Cables of the Adriatic Islands" provides for an investment of 
126,234,875 German marks [DM] over the coming six-month period 
to replace damaged electric power links among the Adriatic 
islands, and to lay new ones. On the list of priorities are 
35-kilovolt cables between Peljesac and Korcula, Peljesac and 
Mljet, Korcula and Lastovo, Vis and Hvar, Brac and Solta, Zadar 
and Dugi Otok, and Losinj and Silba, together with a 
35/10-kilovolt Losinj 2 transformer station; there are also 
plans to overhaul the electric supply system in the part of 
Split-Dalmatia Zupanija that is the farthest behind in 
development (Vis, Solta, and Drvenik Veliki). Discussing the 
work of the electric power system in Dalmatia, which is still 
part of the "island regime," HEP general director Eng. Damir 
Begovic emphasized that electric power links in the south of the 
country are in extremely poor condition due to poor maintenance 
and inadequate investment, and that the presented reconstruction 
program is the basis for developing the tourist economy. Eng. 
Begovic informed the journalists that negotiations are under way 
on acquiring the first equipment necessary to begin revitalizing 
the medium-voltage network on the islands, in which DM14 million 
will be invested. It is expected that a contract with the German 
suppliers, under the "sponsorship" of the HERMES underwriter, 
will be signed in April of this year. 
  Discussing the current electric power situation in the 
country, Eng. Begovic said that despite the division in the 
electric power systems of southern and northern Croatia, there 
will be no major problems in supplying electric power. A 
reliable supply of electricity in Dalmatia is guaranteed by the 
120 megawatts of installed output at diesel and gas plants set 
up as intervention measures. Work on completing the 110-kilovolt 
"island link" through Melina-Krk-Rab-Pag to Zadar is progressing 
according to plan, and completion of the so-called zero phase is 
expected in July of this year. Construction of the 
thermoelectric power plant in Dujmovaca, near Split, is also on 
schedule, and the first generator, with 26 megawatts of power, 
will be synchronized to the network on the 17th of this month. 
  Because of the war and the shortage of investment resources, 
the electric power situation in the rest of Croatia, especially 
in Slavonia, also requires intervention. Electric power 
installations are in disrepair, so that the HEP is missing out 
on 200 megawatts of output because there is no money for maximum 
utilization of the existing systems. The HEP has indicated that 
it will be forced to continually import electric power from 
Western European countries until it is possible to invest in 
repairs to the "Rijeka" and "Plomin I" thermoelectric plants and 
to other important electric power installations. Moreover, the 
financial situation at HEP is burdened by old debts "worth" 
DM200 million. On the other hand, demand by debtors, especially 
industries that are unable to pay existing debts for the supply 
of electric power, are continually on the rise and currently 
amount to around DM170 million. Of that amount, DM20 million is 
owed by health care institutions, waterworks, and other 
protected consumers. The worst situation is in Dalmatia, which 
because of its isolation in terms of trade and energy is in a 
very difficult position, so that problems with recovering debts 
are also great. 
  The journalists were also informed of the beginning of the 
HEP transformation process, which will take place gradually and 
is expected to take five years. It is expected that the HEP will 
be privatized based on the "Ina" [Petroleum Refining and Sales 
Enterprise] model, while it is expected that this public 
enterprise will be listed as a joint-stock company in June of 
this year. One of the principles for restructuring the HEP, 
which is being conducted by the Office of the Government of the 
Republic of Croatia for the Economy and the Restructuring of 
Public Enterprises, is consideration for the zupanija structure.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "Czech Republic Pressing for </F>
Liberalization of World Trade--Vladimir Dlouhy Claims That 
Social and Ecological Dumping Are Misleading Concepts--The 
Customs Union With Slovakia Is a Functioning Instrument, 
According to the Minister"] 
  [Text] The Uruguay Round had lasted too long and had 
resulted in too little, Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of commerce 
and industry, proclaimed at Monday's festive meeting with 
commercial attaches from countries that are represented in 
Prague. Although this sentence was uttered outside of the 
protocol and was not part of the minister's speech, it 
emphasized the principal thought V. Dlouhy intended to 
communicate to the world once more. That is to say that the 
Czech Republic, with this government at its helm, will, within 
the framework of its possibilities, be promoting the maximum 
liberalization of world trade, on both multilateral platforms 
and in bilateral forums. It will do so all the more vehemently 
because it "set out into the rain without an umbrella" on its 
own, the minister recalled. The relatively small economy of the 
Czech Republic that had successfully overcome the delicate 
period of the past years as a part of the Czechoslovak 
Federation, as well as weathering one year of independent 
existence, needs to grow today. 
  V. Dlouhy considers a rise in exports, which the Czech 
Republic intends to achieve by utilizing its own comparative 
advantages, to be the most important factor involved in economic 
growth. The minister ranks the possibility of lower prices, 
resulting from lower Czech wages, among these comparative 
advantages. In this connection, the minister could not resist 
criticizing the countries of the European Union that frequently 
block deliveries of Czech goods by claiming that these shipments 
involve dumping tactics. Social and ecological dumping are 
misleading concepts, stated Dlouhy, and added that the economic 
problems and their social aspects with which the countries of 
the European Union are confronted today should not constitute a 
reason for the Union to hinder competition for its domestic 
products with other products, and thus also Czech goods. This is 
primarily true in categories that are designated as being 
"sensitive." In defiance of the important association agreement, 
trade in these "sensitive" products has a long way to go toward 
liberalization on the part of the European Union. 
  The minister's speech mentions trade with Slovakia in only 
one sentence: In 1993, 20 percent of Czech exports went to 
Slovakia, and Slovakia shared in Czech imports to the extent of 
18 percent, so Slovakia was the second-largest trading partner 
of the Czech Republic. Outside of the protocol, however, the 
minister, again evidently with the intention of letting the 
world know, stated that the customs union between both countries 
is a functioning instrument that has resulted in advantages for 
both sides. He underscored, with great emphasis, that "we cannot 
afford the idea of wrecking the customs union," despite problems 
that arise from time to time. He stated that, following a minor 
period of improvisation, even foodstuffs are once more passing 
across the Czech-Slovak border without problems.

<F P=106> [Article by (top): "Territorial Projects Will Be in the Form </F>
of Systems Measures; Newly Conceived Active Employment Policy 
Instruments Involve Seven Topical Groups"] 
  [Text] As of the second half of this year, some new or 
newly conceived active employment policies (APZ) are expected to 
be introduced into practice. The philosophy of the changes was 
approved by the leadership of the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs in January; subsequently, directors of labor offices 
were familiarized with this philosophy. The document divides the 
instruments of APZ into seven topical groups as follows: 
<H5>  1. Job Training </H5>
  A change in the structure of professions is the most 
effective APZ instrument available in solving the discrepancy 
between supply and demand in the area of manpower. 
Organizationally, job training will be handled on three 
levels--at the initiative of the labor offices, at the 
initiative of applicants for employment themselves, and at the 
initiative of employers. 
  In the first case--that is to say, in the case of activities 
organized by the labor offices--the goal is to provide room for 
the training of applicants who lack any previous work 
experience, to facilitate the deliberate training of applicants 
who have been registered at the labor office for more than six 
months (and, in limited quantities, also provide for nonspecific 
training), and, finally, to provide nonspecific training for 
those who have been registered for long periods. The financing 
of this type of activity will be accomplished in the same manner 
as has been the case for requalification up to now. 
  An applicant or a person interested in employment may 
initiate his own job training if, on the one hand, the labor 
office recognizes the purposefulness of this training in terms 
of subsequent job placement, and also a person (who is already 
unemployed or one who has already received notice according to 
Section 46, Letters a through c, of the Labor Code) whose 
existing profession is unassertable in the labor market. In the 
case of applicants for specific jobs, the labor office may 
defray up to two-thirds of the costs involved; in the event of 
the nonspecific training of those interested in employment, it 
may defray up to one-third of the costs, and, in the case of 
specific training of job applicants, it may again defray up to 
two-thirds of the overall costs. 
  Training organized by an employer is intended to cover the 
need for manpower in the case of a change in production from 
existing resources, and, on the other hand, it is intended to 
facilitate the smooth transition to other jobs for those 
employees who are released for so-called organizational reasons. 
In case of an employee whom the organization would be 
demonstrably releasing (and whose profession is not very 
assertable on the labor market) but whom the organization would 
continue to employ after retraining, the state share of 
financing this training could amount to up to one-half of the 
costs. If a released worker is being retrained (and has an 
unassertable profession) for another employer (customized 
training), the compensation paid by the state could amount to as 
much as two-thirds of the costs. The same is true where an 
organization is training employees of another institution that 
it will subsequently hire. 
<H5>  2. Contractual Jobs </H5>
  The currently not overly clear category of "socially 
purposeful job" (SUPM) will be replaced by the precisely defined 
variations used in creating so-called contractual jobs (SM): 
  All types of financial assistance applicable to the present 
SUPM categories will be applicable to the SM categories in the 
form of self-employment by applicants and selected groups of 
those interested in employment in the form of individual 
entrepreneurial activity (plus the subsequent possible creation 
of additional jobs). The specific types of compensation of costs 
connected with the development of new jobs will be judged by the 
labor offices; the maximum possible amount of the contribution 
will amount to 60,000 korunas [Kc] (a condition for this is the 
minimum two-year existence of a given job). 
  Contractual jobs with employers should contribute to solving 
the problems of regional unemployment (particularly in regard to 
the more poorly assertable professions). The Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs plus other organs of state administration 
shall periodically establish regions (identified by name or 
through the form of criteria) in which it is possible to provide 
financial support for this type of contractual job. The 
appropriate labor office will then announce a selection 
proceeding. For purposes of solving unemployment in certain 
territories by shifting manpower to another region, there should 
be the possibility of announcing this proceeding even outside of 
the territory administered by the initiating labor office 
(following agreement with the office that has jurisdiction in 
that region). But, fundamentally, these must be new jobs for 
registered applicants. In such a case, the financing is the same 
as for all types of existing SUPM creations, with a maximum 
amount of the contribution per job amounting to Kc50,000. It is 
expected that the possibility will exist to defray all types of 
ongoing and one-time costs connected with the creation and 
operation of the job involved (according to the judgment of the 
labor office), but for a maximum period of 12 months. The 
developed contractual job must exist for a period of two years. 
  An instrument to facilitate entrance to the labor market is 
represented by contractual jobs in the form of specialized work 
done by graduates of schools and by young people. The method is 
again the announcement of a selection proceeding (following 
agreement with the labor office, even in another region). The 
overall sum of the state contribution per job must not exceed 
Kc50,000. The time limit for defraying these expenses is 12 
months. In justified cases, where the employment conditions are 
terminated prematurely, however, the labor office may forgo the 
enforced recovery of the resources expended. 
  The temporary placement of unqualified applicants for 
employment (and those who are difficult to retrain), with the 
objective of finding them long-term employment, is the principal 
motive behind the development of those contractual jobs 
categorized as short-term employment for those who are difficult 
to place. These jobs should come into being on the basis of 
agreement between the labor office and the employing institution 
on a priority basis in such cases where the employer pledges to 
maintain at least a portion of the jobs that have been developed. 
  In such a case, the state may compensate the employer for 
wages paid for a period of six months for contractual jobs so 
created and may, moreover, pay him a contribution of Kc20,000, 
provided the employer pledges to maintain the job in question 
for an additional 12 months and employs the original applicant 
in that position. Furthermore, the employer may receive 
compensation for wages paid for a leader of a working group made 
up of at least five such short-term employees for a period of 
six months. The group leader need not be a job applicant of 
record but must not be originally a basic employee of the 
institution involved. 
<H5>  3. Public Investments </H5>
  A new instrument of the APZ--employment on public investment 
projects--differs conceptually from the previous understanding. 
Work categorized as periodic activities of community and public 
entities will no longer be subsidized; rather, support will be 
forthcoming for investments made from public resources, which 
will create prerequisites for the development of new and 
permanent jobs. 
  It will be possible to finance this kind of activity to the 
full extent of wage expenses incurred by placed applicants (12 
months), the costs of mobility (possibly even of providing 
quarters for a period of six months) of employees who have been 
hired, and the wage costs even for the group leader (with at 
least five subordinates) who is not an original employee of the 
institution involved. 
<H5>  4. Employing the Physically Handicapped </H5>
  Support for the creation of jobs for citizens with impaired 
work abilities or those who are permanently handicapped will 
mainly take the form of subsidies for newly created protected 
workplaces and their operation. The state contribution per job 
developed can, in extreme cases, amount to as much as Kc100,000 
(in the event a permanently handicapped person is placed). A 
condition is a minimum two-year duration of this job. The state 
contribution toward the operation of a protected workshop (work 
site) will amount to as much as Kc20,000 per job, in the event 
this is essential for purposes of preserving that job. 
<H5>  5. Partial Employment Agreements </H5>
  Employment on the basis of other than a complete work 
agreement should solve the work assertion of individuals who are 
not in a position to accept a complete work agreement (for 
example, those caring for a child, etc.). Moreover, this form of 
employment should form a certain barrier against releasing 
employees in cases where the employer is switching over to a new 
production program. 
  Financially, it is possible to cover all types of expenses 
connected with the establishment of such a job (for example, 
even a contribution for transporting material in the case of 
work at home, etc., is possible). The total contribution must 
not exceed Kc25,000 and can be available for a maximum of 12 
months. The job must exist for at least two years. 
  The new system of an active employment policy no longer 
counts on employing people on the basis of a partial employee 
obligation (so-called kurzarbeit--short-term work). 
This instrument will be utilized individually only in cases 
where its effectiveness is clearly documented. 
<H5>  6. Transport Contribution </H5>
  This is a new instrument of an APZ that will make it 
possible 
to mitigate the negative impact of a reduced number of 
transportation lines usable for commuting to work. "Clients" in 
this case are thus the job applicants whose placement is 
demonstrably hampered by nonexistent transport connections. 
  The regions in which this instrument will be applied will be 
determined either by the Directorate of Employment Services of 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or jobs of this type 
will come into being at the initiative of the labor offices or 
directly at the initiative of job applicants. 
  Subsidizing opportunities will consist of the state paying 
part of the cost of the employer incurred for transporting 
workers (on the basis of temporary calculations). The maximum 
monthly subsidy per job, however, can be at the most Kc1,000 and 
will be paid for a maximum of one year. 
<H5>  7. Projects Involving the Territorial Revival of Employment </H5>
  A new APZ instrument in the form of regional projects for 
the 
revival of employment has as its goal the systems solution of 
this problem in those regions that are most impacted. These 
projects formulate the most effective variation of the money 
flow to support the APZ and recommend even additional possible 
measures that contribute to solving unemployment (for example, 
the economic stimulation of suitable entrepreneurial efforts at 
various locations, etc.). 
  The processing of these projects will be entrusted to 
specifically identified firms (for example, institutions that 
have experience regarding territorial planning, and organs of 
state administration and self-administration should be 
participating on a "subsupplier" basis (free of charge). The 
project will be assigned on the basis of a selection proceeding, 
announced by the labor office and evaluated by a coordinating 
commission (made up of representatives of the region--for 
example, the okres office, the self-administration office, the 
labor office, the education office, the bank, etc.). This same 
commission is simultaneously the control organ for the project. 
  The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs will identify those 
regions in which it is possible to finance projects of 
territorial employment revival out of state resources. This 
means the compensation of costs (up to their full extent) 
incurred for processing the project, as well as the costs of the 
activities of the coordinating commission (for a period 
determined by the labor office, and to a maximum of Kc30,000).

<F P=106> [Article by (vac): "Germany Is Firming Up Its Position as </F>
the Strongest Trading Partner of the Czech Republic--According 
to the Czech Statistical Office, Slovakia Accounts for One-Fifth 
of the Foreign Trade Volume"] 
  [Text] Prague (vac)--Since 1989, the share of individual 
countries in the foreign trade volume of the Czech Republic has 
changed fundamentally. While in 1989 the European countries of 
the former CEMA accounted for 54 percent of the total volume of 
foreign trade for the CSFR and the countries with developed 
market economies accounted for 31 percent, last year the share 
of countries with developed market economies rose to 72 percent, 
whereas the European countries of the former CEMA accounted for 
a share that had declined to 18 percent. This is evident from 
data provided by the Czech Statistical Office. 
  The strongest export territory for the Czech Republic was 
the 
Federal Republic of Germany last year, with 26.9 percent, 
followed by Slovakia, with 20 percent. Following an 
extraordinarily large gap, exports to the former USSR amounted 
to 6 percent, to Austria 6.2 percent, to Italy 5 percent, and to 
Great Britain 3.1 percent. Only 2 to 3 percent of our exports 
went to China, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Poland; 
less than 2 percent were directed to the other countries. We 
import the largest volume of goods from the Federal Republic of 
Germany--25.1 percent; from Slovakia, we import 17.7 percent, 
from the countries of the former USSR 11.5 percent (crude oil 
and gas), from Austria 7.7 percent, from Italy 4.7 percent, from 
France 3.1 percent, and from the United States 3 percent. Two to 
3 percent of our imports come from the Netherlands, Poland, 
Great Britain, and Switzerland. The other countries account for 
less than 2 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Jerzy </F>
Milewski"] 
  [Text] The person of Jerzy Milewski has become, following 
the reorganization by Minister [of Defense Piotr] Kolodziejczyk, 
a bone of contention between the coalition government and the 
Belweder [presidential residence, hence a reference to President 
Lech Walesa's role]. Jerzy Milewski currently holds in his hands 
three functions: deputy minister of national defense; chief of 
the National Security Office (BBN), which comes under the 
Belweder's jurisdiction; and secretary of the National Defense 
Committee. 
  Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk's expansion of Milewski's 
duties in MON [Ministry of National Defense] is seen by the 
coalition government as an attempt to prevent the coalition from 
gaining access and influence in that ministry. Jerzy 
Szmajdzinski of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of 
the Sejm Commission on National Defense, is demanding that the 
prime minister explicitly state the scope of Milewski's 
authority. Lech Falandysz, the Belweder secretary of state, does 
not think that Milewski's being dismissed from his position 
comes into play because "the prime minister would have to take 
into account that, following Milewski's dismissal, the MON chief 
does not intend to propose anyone else, and, without his 
recommendation, the prime minister cannot appoint anyone else." 
  Jerzy Milewski was born in 1935 in Lopuchowek. He completed 
his studies at the Gdansk Polytechnic [Institute of Technology], 
followed by a doctorate in 1966. He continued his scientific 
career at the Institute of Flow Mechanics Machinery of PAN 
(State Academy of Sciences) in Gdansk, at the University of 
Illinois in Chicago, at Stanford University in California, and 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was in charge 
of the Coordination Office of NSZZ Solidarity [Independent 
Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] in Brussels. Following 
his return to Poland, he aligned himself with the presidential 
center of power--he has headed the BBN since January 1991. 
  Milewski is divorced and has two children. In his free time, 
he enjoys mountain climbing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Bogdan </F>
Pek"] 
  [Text] In comparing the sale of the Bank Slaski shares with 
the FOZZ (Fund for Servicing the Foreign Debt) affair, Bogdan 
Pek, a Sejm deputy representing the PSL (Polish Peasant Party, 
one of the coalition partners), set in motion a whole set of 
political and economic events: The discussion he started on the 
workings of the Polish stock exchange was one of the reasons for 
the fall in the share price, while Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak dismissed Stefan Kawalec from his position as deputy 
minister of finance, thereby getting rid of his main opponent to 
the proposition of supporting the BGZ (Food Industry Bank) with 
the better part of the funds set aside in the budget for aiding 
the banks. 
  Bogdan Pek accused the bureaucrats in the Ministry of 
Finance 
of a rather large mistake in fixing the price of the Bank Slaski 
shares, adding that it was not they but rather the exchange and 
the economic condition of the enterprise that should have 
decided on the share price. In his opinion, the state budget was 
the loser in the privatization of Bank Slaski, while bank 
employees profited in availing themselves of "unjustified" 
preferences. In general, they cleared 5.8 trillion zlotys [Z]; 
management representatives profited by nearly Z15 billion. 
  Bogdan Pek was born in 1953 in Krakow. He completed the 
Zootechnical Department of the Academy of Agriculture. He is a 
professional politician: Active in the PSK [expansion unknown], 
he became a member of the Board of Directors and president of 
the Krakow branch of the party. In last year's parliamentary 
elections, he received 8,188 votes and, for the first time in 
his career, won a seat in parliament. In the Sejm, he serves as 
chairman of the Commission on Ownership Transformations [aka 
Privatization]. 
  He is married and has a 9-year-old daughter and an 
18-year-old son, who, he asserts, "would have priced the Bank 
Slaski shares better on his own calculator." His hobby is 
fishing.

  [Text] The responsibilities of Minister of Finance Marek 
Borowski, whose dismissal led to the most serious crisis of the 
governing coalition since September 1993, were taken over by 
Henryk Chmielak, who has served as Borowski's deputy to date. 
The present head of the Finance Ministry has no declared party 
membership. 
  Henryk Chmielak was born in 1948 in Szczecin. He is a Ph.D. 
in economic studies, a graduate of the Economics Department of 
the Main School of Planning and Statistics [the SGPiS; it is now 
called the Main School of Commerce, SGH] in Warsaw. From 1971 to 
1987, he was employed as a research lecturer at the Higher 
School of Social Sciences [which was under the auspices of the 
Central Committee of the PZPR (Polish United Workers Party), the 
Polish communist party] and the SGPiS. From 1987 to 1989, he 
served as deputy director and then director of the Department of 
Regulating Systems in the Planning Commission. In Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki's government, he was named under secretary of state 
in the Central Planning Administration (CUP). In 1991, as vice 
president of the Radio and Television Committee, he was 
responsible for economic and financial matters of Polish Radio 
and Television. In that same year, he was nominated trade 
counselor-minister plenipotentiary of the Polish Embassy in 
Moscow. In Waldemar Pawlak's government, he occupies the 
position of secretary of state, first deputy to the minister of 
finance. 
  Over the course of his career, he has published over 80 
scientific works--books, lectures, and articles in the national 
and foreign press--devoted to the problems of the economy in the 
period of transformation of the capital system and finances of 
the public sector. 
  Henryk Chmielak is married and has one daughter.

no problems. A commission has begun work, its aim being the 
creation of a new banking law and a study of ways to counteract 
the crisis situation. 
  Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was born in 1952 in Warsaw. She is a 
graduate of the Department of Law and Administration of Warsaw 
University, a Ph.D. in legal theory, and a specialist in the 
area of banking law. She attended the Sorbonne for one year on a 
scholarship from the French Government. She was an adjunct 
professor at Warsaw University and at the Department of Canon 
Law at the Academy of Catholic Theology. In 1992, she was named 
director of Warsaw University's Institute of Law and National 
Economic Management. Earlier, beginning in 1989, she was the 
Sejm and Senate expert on public law affairs. From January to 
March 1992, she was the adviser to the director of the Analysis, 
Budget, and Finances Group of NIK [Supreme Board of Inspection]. 
  The first time Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz stood before the 
Commission on Economic Policy and Finances was in December 1991. 
At that time, her candidacy was dismissed by both the commission 
and the Sejm. In March 1992, supported by President Walesa, she 
was accepted and took on the position of president of the 
National Bank of Poland. The first major decision she 
implemented in that position was beginning the process of 
liquidation of the Bank of Commerce and Trade in Katowice.

  [Text] As of this writing, the government coalition has not 
yet decided whether it will replace [Minister of Finance] Marek 
Borowski with one person or with two. What is known, however, is 
that the subsequent candidacy is being considered. Among those 
who may have a chance to be finance minister is Leslaw Paga, 
chairman of the Securities Commission. 
  Several other names have been mentioned to date, as well, 
among them: Henryk Chmielak, lreneusz Sekula, and Wladyslaw 
Baka. Leslaw Paga got on the list of potential ministers right 
after the decision of Adam Tanski, the current chief of the 
State Treasury's Agency for Farm Property and former minister of 
agriculture, who told RZECZPOSPOLITA that he was forced to 
refuse the proposition of taking over the Finance Ministry for 
"purely personal, family reasons." 
  SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) leader Aleksander Kwasniewski 
claims that one should not expect a fast decision on a 
nomination. Final decisions will come only after the budget is 
passed by the Sejm. 
  Leslaw Paga holds a Ph.D. in economics. He began his 
professional career as an assistant at the Maria Sklodowska 
Curie University in Lublin. He was chief of the Center for 
Social Research at the Lublin regional Solidarity office. From 
1989 to 1991, he served as adviser to the minister of finance. 
Later, he was in charge of the Securities Commission at the 
Ministry of Ownership Transformations [aka Privatization]. After 
the commission became independent of the ministry in 1991, Paga 
was named its chairman.

  [Text] The establishment of voivodship and gmina [township] 
patriot-Solidarity coalitions by groupings opposed to the "thick 
black line" [i.e., to forgiveness for the communist 
nomenklatura] and to the "roundtable accord" [between 
communists and Solidarity, in 1989] was appealed for unanimously 
by participants in the Second National Center-Right Conference 
held in Krakow on 29 January. 
  That conference was attended by some 400 burgomasters, 
mayors, aldermen, and representatives of self-government 
dietines from more than 50 cities, along with politicians from 
the Movement for the Republic [RdR], Union for Real Politics 
(UPR), Christian-National Union [ZChN], Center Accord [PC], RTR 
[Movement of the Third Republic], Polish Peasant Party-Peasant 
Accord [PSL-PL], and National Party, along with Solidarity 
activists. They supported the protests of NSZZ Solidarity 
[Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] against 
the crisis budget of the state and the impoverishment of Polish 
families, and they encouraged their supporters to take part in 
the demonstration announced by NSZZ Solidarity for 9 February. 
  Those present also protested the amending of the law on war 
veterans by the Second-Session Sejm as conflicting with 
principles of justice and Polish tradition of honoring the 
sacrifices made in defense of national independence. 
  J. Olszewski warned, "Nowadays, we are facing an attempt to 
turn back the clock of ownership. We must revert to the ideas of 
Solidarity. The tasks facing us transcend the strength of any 
one political party or even bloc. We must reach an accord on the 
principles of the Poland of the future, of the Third Republic, 
or otherwise we shall not topple the old order." A program for 
economic measures was presented by A. Glapinski (PC) and for 
gmina finance by H. Klata (ZChN). 
  "Not just the pilot program but the reform of public 
administration is at stake," Lodz Mayor G. Palka (Solidarity, 
ZChN) pointed out, while S. Pastuszewski (Christian-Democratic 
Labor Party) voiced his satisfaction that the draft law on 
communal savings and loan associations, prepared by deputies of 
the previous Sejm, became championed by the PSL. 
  L. Pruchno-Wroblewski, deputy chairman of UPR, praised the 
ideal model of the gmina as consonant with the principles of his 
party. Malopolska local-government activists B. Bubula and K. 
Barczyk (ZP-RdR) shared their experience in carrying out the 
center-right's local-government program in Krakow and 
Malopolska. Criticisms of the new administrative division of 
Poland into "powiats" were substantiated by the chairman of the 
Rakow Gmina Council, W. Switalski (Christian-Democrtic Labor 
Party). 
  The coming elections to the gminas are the first chance to 
halt the advance of the Left. In this connection, the 
center-right and patriot and Solidarity groupings still have 
much to accomplish, but there is less and less time left.

<F P=106> [Article by Janusz Zablocki: "On the Center Right Program: </F>
Why `Center'"] 
  [Text] Five months have passed since last September's 
parliamentary elections that resulted in the decisive victory of 
the leftist forces. Has anything important happened within the 
center-right bloc in the meantime? As we recall it, after 
getting over their first shock in response to that disaster, the 
center-right parties had declared that they would draw the 
proper conclusions from that experience and begin to build a 
common program and rally round it all their forces, so as to 
defeat the Left in the next elections. What have they done about 
it so far? What shape is being acquired by that common program 
with which the united center-right intends to court the society? 
  On observing what has been happening in that domain in 
recent 
months, a characteristic shift in emphasis should be pointed 
out. The formula of the center-right, adopted and propagated 
before the elections, presupposed a kind of coalition of diverse 
forces, both rightist and centrist, erected on the soil of joint 
acceptance of democracy, the free market, and patriotic and 
Christian values. Yet this precarious balance between the 
rightists and centrists is being upset by their nascent 
postelectoral programs. The rightist parties, certainly 
exploiting that radicalization of attitudes so natural for 
defeated political parties, are becoming more active than the 
centrist ones, seizing the initiative, setting the tone, and 
offering the most catchy programs. This impression is 
strengthened by their language. Nowadays, they hardly ever speak 
of the "center-right"; instead, they stress more and more "the 
integration of the Right." Thus, in the public's eye, the 
center-right is increasingly often reduced to its right wing and 
viewed as the Right alone. 
  The rise of such an image of the center-right has been 
greatly promoted by the entry of the Union for Real Politics 
(UPR), formerly a a party that went it alone, in that coalition 
after the elections. The "Constitution of the Right," drafted by 
UPR, is a set of cohesive program planks influencing the 
political thought of other parties. One example of such 
influence may be the "Program Declaration of the Right," adopted 
on 17 December 1993 by a coalition of four parties--namely, the 
Party of Christian Democrats (PChD), the Conservative Party 
(PK), the Christian Peasant Party (SLCh), and UPR, which was 
published in LAD on 9 January 1994. Thus, the existing bloc of 
parties championing the antileftist alternative has developed an 
explicitly rightist orientation in the absence of an offsetting 
centrist orientation so far (since the latter is not represented 
by the program of the PC-PL-ZChN [Center Accord, Peasant Accord, 
Christian-National Union], a coalition that still cannot decide 
whether to adopt a rightist or a centrist orientation). This 
tilting of the balance within the center-right in the rightist 
direction, many portentous consequences, both for that bloc of 
parties and for its future electoral chances. 
<H5>  What Is Rightist and What Centrist </H5>
  Since we employ the concepts of the right and the center, it 
is high time to define them. The principal and extremely clear 
criterion for their differences is, in my opinion, their 
attitude toward the counsel offered by John Paul II to the 
postcommunist societies in his "Centesimus Annus." Addressing 
these societies, which after 1989 had regained the freedom to 
choose their own road, the pope states, as known, that man's 
present-day problems, in various countries and even more so for 
the planet as a whole, can be solved neither by real socialism 
nor by capitalism such as it exists in the modern world. Hence, 
neither of these ready-made models is acceptable. While 
distancing itself, in accordance with the entire tradition of 
the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, from the 
errors made by both sides, this encyclical encourages exploring 
a socioeconomic model that, whether called capitalism or another 
name--this really is not the issue--would most fully merit the 
name of a system of society tailored to the measure of human 
beings. It would combine the values of private ownership, 
private enterprise, and the free market, with respect for the 
common good and the dignity of working people, placing the state 
and the economy in the service of the whole man and everyman. 
  The attitude toward this fundamental tenet of "Centesimus 
Annus" may differ among the political groupings of the 
postcommunist world. Those meriting the appellation "centrist" 
are the ones that, in the spirit of the encyclical, distance 
themselves from both the "real socialism" risen on the soil of 
Marxism and "real capitalism" risen on the soil of liberalism 
and lacking respect for the human dimension. The rightist 
groupings, on the other hand, are those that, evading the 
simultaneous condemnation of both these errors, confine 
themselves to criticizing "real socialism" alone. They readily 
support the pope's criticism of collectivism and communism, but 
they gloss over and fail to draw conclusions from the criticism, 
offered by the present as well as previous popes, of 
individualism and liberalism, from the warnings against "...the 
peril of the spread of a radical ideology of capitalism" 
("Centesimus Annus," 42), and against blind faith in the 
solution of all problems through the free interplay of market 
forces ("Centesimus Annus," 42)--that is, against the adoption 
of "an `idolatrous' attitude toward the market, in disregard of 
the fact that material boons are by their very nature mere 
chattels" ("Centesimus Annus," 40). 
  Thus, in this sense, the parties who signed the "Program 
Declaration of the Right" have to be viewed as rightist (and 
that is how they define themselves anyhow). In the preamble to 
that document, they declare, "Poland can no longer be a 
laboratory for socialist experiments," but, at the same time, 
they fail to add that it should not be a laboratory for liberal 
experiments, either. This omission is not, of course, fortuitous. 
<H3>  The Right and the Social Teachings of the Roman Catholic 
Church </H3>
  The issue of the attitude of rightist groupings toward the 
basic tenets of "Centesimus Annus" reflects a general pattern: 
The stance of rightist parties, even those that include the 
adjective "Christian" in their appellations, toward the social 
teachings of the church is ambivalent. Even when they refer to 
these teachings in their programs, they always do so in a 
selective manner, stressing those aspects of the teachings that 
are convenient to them and glossing over the others. This 
clearly undermines the credibility of their "Christian" 
declarations because it is reminiscent of the churchgoer who 
follows only those parts of the sermon that suit him. 
  But this applies to only a few of the rightist parties 
because most do not even refer in their programs to the social 
teachings of the church. At most, they mention among their 
highest values, next to the free-market economy, the desire to 
preserve the Christian heritage and the traditional moral 
standards, as expressed, for example, on behalf of the 
Conservative Party, by Aleksander Hall (RZECZPOSPOLITA, 17 
November 1993). This also applies to the ideologists of UPR. 
Similarly, the aforementioned "Program Declaration of the Right" 
avoids, perhaps owing to the impossibility of reaching a 
consensus on this matter, any explicit reference to the social 
teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. At most, that coalition 
"affirms the Christian nature of our civilization, whose 
elemental aspect is tolerance," and the consideration, in public 
life, "of the good of the family and the protection of human 
life and moral order." This is, we must admit, much less than is 
required of Christians by the social teachings of the church. 
<H5>  Shortcomings of "Symbolic" and "Antiabortion" Christianity </H5>
  Let us be fair. We bear in mind and appreciate the fact that 
nearly all of the rightist deputies, including those belonging 
to UPR and to the subsequently established Conservative Party, 
did manage, at difficult moments facing the Sejm, to support the 
inclusion of the provisions on Christian values in the [laws 
passed concerning] radio and television, and they also 
championed the teaching of religion in schools and prolife 
values. They deserve to be praised for it. But Christian 
humanism in public life cannot be confined to just a symbolic 
championing of Christian values. A genuine Christian presence is 
something more than displaying a cross in the Senate 
deliberating room or including an appropriate provision in a 
law. It is achieved chiefly through being present in men's 
attitudes, through a Christian humanism that is inseparably 
linked to sensitivity not just to symbols but to the fate of 
living human beings. Catholicism, as declared by Cardinal Suhard 
in his famous pastoral letter of 1947, is either social 
Catholicism or no Catholicism at all. Similarly, the prolife 
attitude, although highly important, does not exhaust in its 
entirety that testimony that Christianity demands of those 
professing it because Christianity commands caring not only for 
the fate of the unborn but also for that of our neighbors who 
may suffer and need our help. In the language of the modern 
church, this refers to "the preferential option for the sake of 
the poor." But the "poor," whom it is our duty to be aware of 
and help, are those who are poor not only in the material sense; 
they also include the homeless, the incapacitated, and people 
deprived of human rights and of hope for a better future. They 
include as well those threatened by unemployment, those who 
already lost their jobs and cannot support their families, 
school graduates who have no prospects for a decent life, and 
ill-paid pensioners who cannot afford the rising rents and the 
prices of medicines. They include all of the social groups that, 
during the current transition era, are unable, through no fault 
of their own, to make a living and need assistance from others. 
Solidarity with their fate should be expressed not only through 
private charity (as desired by 19th-century liberals) but also 
as a behest of social justice (as demanded by social Catholics 
[as published] in discussions with them). Hence, this requires 
state interventionism and a deliberate social policy of the 
state; this requires such institutional reforms as will assure 
for all an adequate social safety net. 
  Reducing Christian humanism in public life to a struggle for 
symbols or to antiabortion efforts without, at the same time, 
showing sensitivity to the fate of the social strata and groups 
expecting our assistance makes a travesty of that humanism. It 
causes public opinion to form a distorted and false image of the 
Roman Catholic Church, which the public views as standing behind 
the rightist politicians, because the church is being accused of 
focusing on the fate of the unborn and ignoring the fate of 
those already living. We know that this accusation is painfully 
unjust. But don't we Christian politicians somehow warrant it, 
owing to shortcomings in our own Christian testimony? 
<H5>  Attitude Toward the Social Rights of Citizens </H5>
  Thus, one issue dividing the rightist and centrist groupings 
is the attitude toward the social rights that should be vested 
in citizens in the legislation and the Constitution. Unless it 
is analyzed more thoroughly and leads to a reasonable 
compromise, this issue may complicate the center-right consensus 
in the debate on the [new] Constitution. The aforementioned 
"Program Declaration of the Right" views freedom, ownership, and 
respect for national traditions as the sole foundations of 
social order and does not mention such fundamental aspects of 
the Christian vision of social order as social justice or 
solidarity. 
  It is significant that the declaration in question makes no 
mention of such problems as unemployment; it is as if the 
signatory parties are blind to it. The declaration limits state 
interventionism solely to "what is indispensable to the 
protection of life, freedom, or the property of others," and 
makes no provision for any social policy to be pursued by the 
state. (That is certainly due to the influence of UPR, mentioned 
in SLOWO by its spokesman, Rafal Ziemkiewicz: "We are resolutely 
opposed to the pursuit of any social policy whatsoever by the 
state. UPR also demands the privatization of health care and 
education, meaning their profitable operation." How is this to 
be reconciled with the concern for "the good of the family" 
mentioned further on in that declaration?) 
  The declaration supports the elimination of the progressive 
tax system. While it champions [protection for] farmers, which 
is an exception (and certainly the sole concession made to Mr. 
Slisz's SLCh), the declaration does not support tariffs 
protecting domestic manufacturing; instead, if supports "the 
free flow of people, capital, and goods, free international 
trade." Along with rejecting state interventionism, the 
declaration is also opposed to trade union privileges. And, in 
opposition to the postulates of Polish crafts guilds, it 
champions the principle that business and professional 
activities should not be restricted by the requirement of 
compulsory membership in associations of businessmen and 
professionals. 
<H5>  Final Conclusions </H5>
  The above evolution of the center-right bloc into 
essentially 
a rightist bloc is pregnant in grave consequences to it. There 
is the threat of the narrowing of its political stance and 
social base of support. There is also the threat that its 
program is diverging from the road outlined by the latest 
[papal] social encyclical, which is bound to result in losing 
the support of a substantial segment of the Catholic electorate. 
Guiding itself by the social teachings of the church, that 
electorate sees no reason that it should support parties that 
treat these teachings selectively. The rightward shift of the 
programs of the existing center-right bloc also harbors the 
threat that broad public opinion will view it as a force 
oriented toward one-sided support of the interests of employers 
and propertied strata. This is bound to result in losing the 
support of the other segments of the bloc's electorate, such as 
employees facing the threat of losing their jobs, welfare 
recipients, trade union sympathizers, and those championing 
state interventionism. 
  Thus, instead of turning away from the needs and demands of 
these segments of the society, as is being done in the Right's 
program, these problems should be faced and their constructive 
and effective solutions explored. Only this approach reflects 
genuine Christian testimony in public life. Only this approach 
will enable the center-right to establish ties to broad segments 
of the world of work and groups seeking social protection, and 
thus prevent their exploitation by the Left in future elections. 
In Poland, where nearly 3 million people are unemployed, where 
1.5 million lack housing of their own, and where 40 percent of 
families live below the social minimum, these segments of the 
electorate are very large and decisive, as demonstrated by the 
elections of 1993. 
  Thus, if the center-right camp is indeed to deprive the Left 
of votes and defeat it in the next elections, it will have to 
get rid of its "rightist" program. It needs the living presence 
and proactivism of a sociopolitical "center," formed chiefly by 
Catholic-social and trade union forces deriving from Solidarity. 
By analogy with the "Constitution of the Right," a "Constitution 
of the Center" should be drafted and presented to broad public 
opinion. At present, this is an unusually important and urgent 
task because only the coexistence of both these currents, 
differing in their sociopolitical postulates but inspired by the 
same Christian and patriotic orientation and the desire for 
mutual compromise, can lay the foundations of electoral victory 
and turn Poland away from its present crooked road.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Malkiewicz: "Defense Industry Out of </F>
the Woods; Reconversion and Financial Restructuring"] 
  [Text] "By now, there are definite signs that the situation 
in the defense industry is gradually reverting to normal," said 
Roman Czerwinski, deputy minister of industry and trade, at a 
press conference dealing with the armaments branch. "The defense 
industry is of strategic importance to national security and 
sovereignty, and, hence, the state should take charge of it and 
be responsible for it to a greater extent than in the case of 
remaining branches of the economy." 
  After two years of preparations and one year of actual work, 
the restructuring of the defense industry is being focused on 
resolving four principal problems: defining the sector; 
conversion--i.e., retooling from military to civilian 
production; changes in ownership; and financial restructuring. 
  Initially, the problem was the marked shrinkage of markets 
in 
the East owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the biggest 
customer for Polish arms (e.g., for 80 percent of the output of 
the aviation industry) and the general recession in this country 
and in the world, extending also to this industry. An additional 
constraint was the marked expansion of the list of UN-embargoed 
arms shipments by the previous governments, in accordance with 
the expectations of Western political and economic partners, 
which necessitated markedly reducing output down to the level 
merely meeting the needs of national security and defense and 
the forecast export possibilities. These objectives are being 
met, both quantitatively and in terms of range of output, by 31 
arms-manufacturing enterprises. Previously, as many as 82 
enterprises operated in that branch, even though most of them 
were suppliers manufacturing, in addition to civilian products, 
components ordered by makers of finished arms products. On the 
recommendation of the minister of industry and trade, the 
Council of Ministers has classified only 31 enterprises as 
belonging in the defense industry. 
  Safeguarding national security requires maintaining in 
peacetime, as well, the arms-manufacturing capacity needed in 
times of war. But every unutilized machine or production bay 
means an added expense to the plant. Attempts to solve this 
problem in peacetime indicate that the best solution is 
conversion--that is, retooling from military to civilian 
production. The restructuring program, which encompasses such 
conversion, envisages that special [defense] production should 
account for not more than 30-40 percent of the output of each 
plant belonging in the defense industry. 
  The general market principles of free--that is, 
public--privatization [of state enterprises] that the Ministry 
of Ownership Transformations is following normally restrict the 
state's ability to control it, and this conflicts with the 
strategic importance of the defense industry to national 
security and sovereignty. Therefore, the Council of Ministers 
has decided to expand the list of enterprises affected by the 
Law on the Ownership Transformations of Certain State 
Enterprises of Special Importance to the State Sector by adding 
to that list defense-industry enterprises. This means that 
responsibility for ownership transformations in the defense 
industry will be assumed by the minister of industry and trade. 
  The need for financial restructuring is due to the so-called 
nonculpable, in many cases, arrears in payments owed by arms 
enterprises. Their financial restructuring is to be carried out 
so as to exploit the opportunities afforded by the Law on the 
Financial Restructuring of Enterprises and Banks and the 
Commercial Law Code, with bank agreement proceedings to be 
followed in the former case and composition agreement 
proceedings in the latter. At present, the economic situation of 
defense-industry plants is, according to Deputy Minister 
Czerwinski, on the whole satisfactory compared with that of 
other industries. Some 15 or so defense enterprises have 
achieved full financial liquidity, and, at 10 others, gross 
earnings already are beginning to exceed expenses. All 
defense-industry enterprises will be operating in the black by 
the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996. Bank-agreement 
proceedings will greatly contribute to that outcome. 
  The present situation of the enterprises is burdened by the 
mistakes made not only by the government but also by their 
management. Minister Czerwinski cited the example of an 
enterprise that, on the order of its director, dispatched an 
entire trainload of equipment to Russia on 31 December 1992-- 
that is, in a year when everybody already knew by April that the 
Russians were welshing--and not a hair on the director's head 
was touched. Of the $260 million owed by the Russians, so far 
one-half could be recovered from them in the form of so-called 
financial clearing. Last year we did not pay for equipment 
shipments and repair work done by Russians, and the related 
negotiations are still in progress, though this conflicts with 
the principle of placing all orders with Polish enterprises. Of 
the 4 trillion zlotys [Z] allocated for purchases by the 
Ministry of National Defense, Z500 billion was earmarked for the 
acquisition of armaments precisely from Russia. The minister of 
industry and trade selected from among the directors of the 31 
Polish defense-industry enterprises four persons, whom he 
appointed as his representatives commissioned to establish four 
holding companies and, subsequently, a consortium, with the 
object of coordinating promotional and growth policies in the 
defense industry. Instead of formalizing mutual cooperation, the 
group of aviation enterprises resolved to appoint a council of 
directors from that branch, along with commissions and working 
groups for marketing, R&amp;D work, coproduction, etc. 
  The sole bank to support restructuring programs in the arms 
industry is Polska Kasa Opieki (PKO), Inc. To this day, the 
principal problem facing any enterprise is how to finance its 
operations in the event that it receives a big contract, a big 
order. Considerations of national security and the like dictated 
authorizing only one bank to be involved. An additional problem 
is the need to finance so-called export credits, and the PKO, 
Inc. is ready to handle this matter. 
  Responding to many questions of reporters, Minister 
Czerwinski expatiated upon, for example, the problem of 
privatizing arms plants. The method is very simple. At Nowa 
Deba, Radom, and Lucznik plants, separate departments were set 
up for so-called joint ventures, with the participation of 
foreign investors, in isolation from other departments of these 
plants. In speaking of restructuring at enterprises, Minister 
Czerwinski explained that accomplishing it hinges on their 
management; the Ministry of Industry and Trade merely oversees 
these operations as the parent agency. He, the minister, would 
like to bring about a situation in which the enterprise 
directors would know what they want and ask of the ministry 
merely permission to invite a foreign partner to a joint venture 
concerning a discrete plant department. The ministry is 
incapable of handling the restructuring of discrete plants; that 
is a task that was entrusted to the plant directors. The problem 
is only the proper selection of executive personnel.

<F P=106> [Statement by Roman Czerwinski, under secretary of state in </F>
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as noted by Aleksander 
Malkiewicz: "On Defense Industries, There Will Not Be Factory 
Liquidations"] 
  [Text] By now, several months have passed since the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade decided on the restructuring and 
ownership transformations of the defense industry. The trade 
unionists striking last 3 February demanded that [the 
government] increase to 5.5 trillion zlotys [Z] its orders 
placed with the defense industry, provide funds for 
restructuring its enterprises, raise wages, offer reimbursement 
for the funds spent on maintaining readiness for wartime 
production during the years 1990-93 and for the equipment 
exported to the former USSR, and, last, that it reduce the 
number of countries to which it has embargoed arms shipments. 
  ``Recent Sejm legislation has made it possible to operate 
defense-industry enterprises on the basis of laws governing 
joint-stock companies rather than state enterprises. At the same 
time, I wish to emphasize that the minister of industry and 
trade wants to execute on his own the provisions of the Law on 
the Privatization of State Enterprises rather than leave them to 
the minister of ownership transformations. That is because it is 
the duty of the latter minister to not just privatize but also, 
among other things, to sell enterprises [to private investors], 
whereas our minister is going to utilize the new law on 
ownership transformations at defense-industry plants in order to 
restructure these plants while, at the same time, retaining them 
under the control of the State Treasury. Now that this law was 
passed by a large majority in the Sejm, we at the ministry are 
preparing to utilize this instrument as effectively as possible 
immediately after it takes effect. 
  ``Let me remind you that, in the past, we isolated a group 
of 
enterprises to be classified as arms-industry enterprises. The 
26 such enterprises that have by now been partially converted to 
single-person Treasury companies [an intermediate stage of 
privatization] have been divided into enterprises manufacturing 
ammunition and classical weaponry, radioelectronic and optical 
equipment enterprises, aviation enterprises, and artillery and 
armor enterprises. The principal premises of the restructuring 
and development programs are to apply equally to all of these 
groups. 
  ``Another instrument that we have already been effectively 
utilizing since last June is the conclusion of civil-law 
agreements between enterprises and companies, on the one hand, 
and the State Treasury, represented by the minister of industry, 
on the other, to offset the cost of maintaining unused 
productive and technological capacities of the arms industry. We 
have increased the industry's exports markedly--by as much as 40 
percent compared with 1992--although I must regretfully admit 
that we have not yet reattained the 1989 level of our exports. 
We assume, however, that we shall break that record if not this 
year then the next, owing to the improving situation on the 
world markets. We also pay great attention to sponsoring the 
development of new civilian products; here the Committee for 
Scientific Research provides us with considerable support by 
funding 50 percent of the related targeted projects. 
  ``By 31 March, the effects of the new law on the financial 
restructuring of banks and enterprises should become tangible. 
Some of our enterprises have been able to sign agreements under 
that law. We expect the worst-performing among defense-industry 
enterprises to sign such agreements with their creditors, which 
means that not only our ministry but also the banks will 
consider positively the possibilities for the restructuring and 
further management of that industry. 
  ``We also have new declarations, new instruments that will 
be 
applied this year. At the ministry, we are trying to increase 
the number of government loan guarantees provided. Altogether, 
about Z25 trillion is earmarked in the budget for such 
guarantees, and, at its next meeting, the Council of Ministers 
will consider, among other things, providing such guarantees for 
the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant. Moreover, providing 
them also for the Hydral Transportation Equipment Plant in 
Wroclaw is currently under discussion at our ministry. Others, 
too, are helping us. Thus, the minister of foreign economic 
relations is trying to get more funds to spend on promoting 
[foreign sales of the products] of the four above-mentioned 
arms-industry groups. Hence, this also concerns interministerial 
cooperation in certain domains rather than cooperation among 
discrete enterprises. 
  "In connection with the discussion of programs for social 
protection, the Sejm is currently considering a law on so-called 
preretirement benefits; that law will especially apply to 
arms-industry enterprises because they are located in regions of 
greatest unemployment. We shall not at the same time try to 
utilize the Z2 trillion allocated to us by the World Bank for 
the social protection of the employees of shut-down plants. 
Under our program, in classifying 31 enterprises as 
arms-industry ones, we were guided by the principle of mergers 
instead of shutdowns. Thus, none of these enterprises will be 
closed."

<F P=106> [Article signed Olivier Revelant: "Fourth Framework </F>
Program: A Difficult Birth"] 
  [Text] European research has just had a close shave. 
Against the backdrop of the Treaty of Maastricht, the 
persistent disagreement between the European Parliament and the 
Council of Ministers almost sabotaged the implementation of the 
fourth framework program for research and development. It came 
within an inch of seeing its coffers empty at the start of 1995. 
  The formal proposal and the content of the specific programs 
of the fourth framework program for technological research and 
development were approved by the European Commission 6 October 
1993. The total sum proposed for life sciences amounted to 1.265 
billion ECU [European Currency Units]. This represents 10 
percent of the total framework program budget -- 13.1 billion 
ECU -- to which we should add the 600 million ECU earmarked for 
the Community's joint research center whose status is currently 
under discussion. The joint research center consists of four 
structures located in Ispra [Italy], Petten [Netherlands, 
Institute of Advanced Materials], Geel [Belgium, Institute of 
Measurement and Reference Materials], and Karlsruhe [Germany, 
Transuranian Institute]. It is directed by Jean-Pierre Contzen. 
We must bear in mind that the budget for the third framework 
program was only 6.6 billion ECU. However, the budget has not 
risen significantly: The two framework programs differ in that 
now no Community research can be carried out outside of the 
framework program. In this context, the budget for the fourth 
framework program has risen by no more than five percent. 
<H5>  General Content of the Program </H5>
  According to the most recent estimates, the life sciences 
budget will be split up as follows: 46 to 50 percent to the 
biotechnologies sector; 15 to 19 percent to biomedicine and 
health; 33 to 37 percent to the application of living sciences 
to agriculture and fishing (this sector also includes 
agro-industries, forestry, rural development, and food 
technologies), and 4 to 8 percent on cross-disciplinary 
demonstration activities. The aim of these activities is to 
establish the technical feasibility of new approaches: They 
must simplify the transfer of technology to the users. Lastly, 
one to three percent of the budget will go to finance legal, 
ethical, and social aspects in order to improve dialogue between 
the main national and sociopolitical viewpoints. The subjects 
examined will include the problems raised by biodiversity, organ 
transplants, the confidentiality of genetic information, genetic 
therapy, and genetic fingerprinting. This activity concerns the 
three domains of biotechnology, biomedicine and health, and 
agro-industrial research. 
  For biotechnologies, the priorities will range from the 
"cell 
factory" (combining biological approaches and engineering 
dedicated to solving industrial problems), to the molecular 
biology of plants, cellular communication in neuroscience 
(cooperation with the international Human Frontiers program 
should in particular be strengthened), and genome analysis. It 
should be noted that the Commission's proposal once again refers 
to the analysis of genomes, and not merely to the human genome, 
contrary to the heading of the first version. AIDS, infectious 
illnesses (tuberculosis), cancer, and pharmaceutical and 
chemical research (in particular in vitro toxicity tests and the 
development of new animal models) will receive Community funding 
in the biomedicine and health sector. Finally, where the 
application of living science and technology to agriculture and 
fishing is concerned, the Community will focus its efforts on 
creating projects that affect all aspects of the transformation 
process for the main crops and products (from agriculture to the 
finished product, food and otherwise). 
<H5>  A Complex Decisionmaking Process </H5>
  The delays noted in setting up this fourth framework program 
are mainly due to the coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty 
which ushered in European Union on 1 November 1993. To provide 
for this delay, the third framework program budget was extended 
in June 1993 by 900 million ECU. The Treaty on European Union 
considerably alters the Community decisionmaking processes: The 
European Council, after consulting the parliament, votes by a 
qualified majority on specific programs. Thus, 23 programs 
figured in the Council's last version, while the Commission was 
proposing 18. The establishment of programs, whether under the 
Single European Act or the Treaty of the Union, is a two-stage 
procedure: one stage for the program and another stage for 
specific programs. However, while for the third framework 
program the specific programs were approved by the qualified 
majority vote of the Council after consulting the parliament, 
the fourth framework program must be approved unanimously by 
both the Council and the European Parliament (the coordination 
procedure). In the event of disagreement, and unlike the 
procedure under the Single Act, the program may be read a third 
time before parliament with the prior constitution of a 
conciliation committee. 
<H5>  Delayed Approval </H5>
  In this new decisionmaking framework, most Member States 
supported the Commission's proposal at a meeting held in 
Luxembourg on 11 October 1993. However, the main capital 
providers -- France, Germany, and the United Kingdom -- found 
the total sum a bit steep and would be happy with a total budget 
of just 10 billion ECU. The Council in particular considered 
the increase in the grants to the IT and communications 
technologies sector and to the energy sector to be too high 
(from four to seven percent and from one to four percent 
respectively). It is clear that this three-way opposition was 
vital to keeping to the schedule for program implementation, all 
the more so since certain countries, after having given their 
support on 11 October, were on the point of backing down. On 18 
November, at the second reading, the parliament decided to test 
out the new powers granted to it in the Treaty on European Union 
and voted for a budget higher than the one proposed by the 
Commission (13.7 billion ECU with an unchanged global budget for 
life sciences) after having made some 140 amendments, most of 
which originated with the Energy and Technological Research 
Commission [CERT]. For the parliament, the extra monies were 
justified by the fact that certain programs (Thermie, for 
example) now fall under the auspices of the program, and by the 
need to finance the socio-economic measures (100 million ECU). 
  The finale came on 6 December, when the Council submitted a 
new proposition to the parliament. An agreement was reached on 
the distribution of the funds, but not on the total: the 
Council proposed a budget of 11.5 billion ECU. Biology was 
particularly well funded, with a budget representing 15 percent 
of the overall total. The framework program is split into four 
subprograms: technological R&amp;D and demonstration; cooperation 
with third countries and international organizations; the 
distribution and use of the results of Community research; and 
the training and mobility of researchers. The life sciences 
budget represents 13.1 percent of the first subprogram which 
itself represents 27.8 percent of the total, a higher figure 
than that proposed by the Commission. This boost to the life 
sciences budget received the strong backing of Portugal, Greece, 
Ireland, and Spain since it includes the agriculture and fishing 
sectors. We should note that the industrial technologies budget 
has also been raised (16.2 percent) while the budget for 
information technologies has been cut (28 percent). The 
parliament will not be able to examine this proposal until 
February 1994. The logical hypothesis is that it will again 
amend the text before ratifying it, which would constitute a 
rejection, since the text must be approved in the same terms by 
both structures. It is nonetheless possible that agreement will 
be reached on a budget of about 13 billion ECU -- which would 
suit the parliament -- one billion of which would be frozen -- 
which would suit the Council. This proposal has received the 
backing of all countries except for Germany (for technical 
reasons). The Treaty of the Union favors this type of solution 
since it imposes a review of financial perspectives in 1996. 
France also proposed that the Heads of State decide on the 
budget total at the European Council meeting of 10 and 11 
December, since all negotiations have to be completed before the 
end of the current legislative term in June 1994. Agreement was 
finally reached on a high total: 12 billion Ecu plus 1.12 
billion ECU in reserve. The Council of Ministers ratified this 
decision at its meeting on 22 December. It suggested that 5.9 
billion ECU be assigned in the first two years with 6.1 billion 
ECU for the following two years (while holding back the frozen 
one billion ECU). The joint research center would benefit from a 
budget of 875 million ECU. In the best possible hypothesis, the 
parliament would rule on the dossier in the last week of January 
and the whole thing could be approved according to Parliamentary 
procedure A, i.e. without a plenary session debate and with an 
almost automatic vote. This agreement, obtained in extremis, 
would make it possible to avoid the coffers of European research 
being empty on 1 January 1995 and Greece, which is to take over 
the EC presidency from Belgium on 1 January 1994, will not then 
inherit this thorny issue.

  [Text] The Senate of the German Research Association [DFG] 
has decided to set up 14 new priority programs and to extend 
three others. In the Senate's opinion, 13 other programs out of 
a total of 45 new applications and four for extensions deserved 
funding in full on technical grounds but had to be rejected 
because of the DFG's tight financial situation. The other 
applications were also considered to be interesting and 
attractive by the Senate. There will be three new priority 
programs in the humanities and social sciences, and in the 
biological sciences. Five new programs will be set up in the 
natural sciences and one will be extended. There will be three 
new programs in engineering sciences and two others will be 
extended. 
  Many of the priority programs deal with current problems. In 
the social sciences and humanities, the program entitled "Global 
Environmental Changes: Social and Behavioral Science 
Dimensions" will examine the role of man as the cause and victim 
of these problems. How does the individual cope with global 
environmental changes? How do social groups and nations react? 
This interdisciplinary program intends to develop environmental 
and economic solutions. It will also analyze the endangered 
ecosystem of the third world, with emphasis on population growth 
and migration. The program entitled "Efficient Organization of 
Financial Markets and Institutions" also deals with contemporary 
problems. Germany's financial infrastructure is about to be 
fundamentally reorganized so as to improve international 
competitiveness. It is envisaged that the problems raised by 
the reorganization will be identified and solved by coordinated 
research. The theme of the third new priority program in the 
field of social sciences and humanities is "Information 
Processing in a Social Context." 
  Priority programs in the biological sciences will be set up 
on the following topics: "Molecular Analysis of Regulation 
Networks in Bacteria," "Metabolism and Growth of Plants under 
Increased CO2 Concentrations," and "Genetic Analysis of Social 
Systems." In this last program, groups concerned with 
sociobiology and molecular genetics are working together. They 
are studying adaptation by natural and sexual selection during 
the course of evolution. How do pairing systems and propagation 
strategies develop in the animal kingdom? How can the division 
of labor and altruism be explained? 
  The five newly launched priority programs in the natural 
sciences are: "Ergodic Theory, Analysis and Efficient 
Simulation of Dynamic systems," "Theory of Relativistic Effects 
in the Chemistry and Physics of Heavy Elements," "Structure and 
Function of Polyhedral Structures Composed of Main Group 
Elements," "Change in the Geo-biosphere over the Past 15,000 
Years - Continental Sediments as an Expression of Changing 
Environmental Conditions," and "Refractory Organic Acids in Open 
Waters." The "II-VI Semiconductors" program is being extended. 
  The new programs in the engineering sciences are "Mobile 
Communications," "Efficient Algorithms for Discrete Problems and 
their Application," and "Supercooled Metal Melts-Phase Selection 
and Glass Formation." The programs "Ion and Plasma Surface 
Technology," and "Innovative Quality Assurance in Production" 
are being extended. Basic research and industry will work 
together in the "Mobile Communications" program. Experts from 
microelectronics and high frequency engineering intend to solve 
the problems of transmitting and switching long-distance calls. 
  The funding for the 17 newly launched and extended programs 
amounts to 48.2 million German marks [DM]. In 1994, the DFG 
will support 104 priority programs altogether with subsidies 
totaling DM224.9 million. A typical feature of these funding 
procedures is the supraregional cooperation between the 
participating scientists. Researchers from various institutions 
and disciplines work together for a limited time, mostly six 
years. In addition to special research fields, priority 
programs are the most important method of promoting 
interdisciplinary coordinated research.

<F P=106> [Article by D.G.: "Parliament Wishes to Support European </F>
Electronics"] 
  [Text] To avoid European dependence on others in the field 
of electronics (the term "electronics" is used here to cover 
electronics for the general public, components, measures, 
manufacturers, telecommunications, information technology and 
office technology, automation, and software), the European 
Parliament has asked the Commission to improve its support for 
this sector of European industry. In the report, a company is 
considered to be European if it manufactures, undertakes 
research and development in Europe, and makes decisions 
concerning the above two activities in Europe. 
  Through its 18 January resolution, the European Parliament 
gives its unconditional support to Europe's electronics 
industry. The draft resolution is submitted by the European 
Parliament to the Commission. It is a statement of intent, 
which the Commission may use. However, the Parliament is only 
consulted over electronics -- it is not party to decisionmaking. 
It thus calls upon the Commission to use all the means at its 
disposal to assist European electronics exports to Japan and the 
United States. In particular, in view of the difficulties in 
penetrating the U.S. and Japanese public markets, the European 
Parliament suggests "systematically including a reciprocity rule 
in Community legislation" so as to offset the lack of European 
protectionism in public markets. In the same spirit, it asks 
the Commission to negotiate fair competition with the European 
Union's trading partners, including stabilization of currencies 
and exchange rates, in addition to respect for the rules of the 
International Labor Office, and for international regulations 
over the environment. 
  The Parliament also invites the Commission to work with the 
Council of the European Union to draft two notices before 1 
January 1995. The first notice will apparently concern the 
conclusion of "agreements similar to the U.S.-Japanese agreement 
on semiconductors," or of "an `electronic' agreement similar to 
the `automobile' agreement with Japan." The second notice seems 
likely to concern the establishment of Community protection 
measures. 
  Regarding components, so as to avoid dependence on a single 
non-European manufacturer, the Parliament's "statement of cause" 
(the "statement of cause" explains the reasons for the draft 
resolution; the resolution is what has been adopted by the 
European Parliament) suggests the establishment of a European 
participation fund to finance a part of the research dedicated 
to commercial purposes. This would enable "the strengthening of 
the technological and financial base of the European electronics 
industry." 
  In practical terms, through its draft resolution the 
European 
Parliament also demands aid for "cooperation over research and 
development for precompetitive and competitive innovations." It 
also asks the Commission to "strengthen and accelerate 
technological research efforts undertaken under the European 
research framework programs, and under the EUREKA initiative", 
and to give legal and financial assistance for "reconstruction 
and rationalization initiatives emanating from the private 
sector and aiming to improve adaptation to the global market." 
It gives its support to the possibility of creating European 
trusts capable of competing with the American, Japanese, and 
South Korean giants by insisting that the Commission should 
authorize mergers and cooperation whenever necessary for the 
survival of the European industry. In the same spirit, it calls 
for harmonization of technical standards, taking the GSM 
standard as an example. 
  Furthermore, it insists that the European Union should 
maintain "expertise in the development and implementation of 
pan-European networks for the exchange of data, so as to ensure 
its interoperability."

<F P=106> [Article signed `D.G.': "ESPRIT Tackles Multichip Modules"] </F>
  [Text] The European ESPRIT project is to devote two and a 
half years to developing multichip modules on ceramic and 
organic substrates. This subprogram, known as Chippac, is being 
managed by the Bull company. 
  The heads of the European ESPRIT research program have just 
entrusted the management of the Chippac microassembly program to 
Bull. This subprogram, to run for two and a half years, is to 
use models to demonstrate the operational reliability of 
multichip modules (MCM) and single-chip modules (SCM) designed 
on the basis of the results of several previous studies of 
substrates and modes of connection. Other European companies 
will also participate in this project, notably Framatome, GEC 
Marconi UK, IMC, Alcatel-Mietic, SGS-Thomson, and Telefonica. 
The results of Chippac will have to be suitable for use in 
applications as varied as information technology, 
telecommunications, robotics, transport, or even for the general 
public. Participants in the Chippac project will initially 
concentrate on several basic studies of modules, starting with 
the problem of the reliability of bare chips. In particular, 
Chippac will seek to develop testing methods and tools to enable 
the quality of bare chips to be guaranteed before their assembly 
on the module (KGD: known good die). Two further studies will 
concentrate on ceramic (particularly low-temperature cosinters) 
and organic substrates, with the aim of comparing different 
kinds of products, and determining the limits and rules for 
their design. 
<H5>  A Thorough Study Based on Ball Bearings </H5>
  Chippac will also look into modes of interconnection of bare 
chips (known as "first level of connection"). Wire connection 
up to 75fm and by TAB without bossing onto the chip (connection 
on the strip being by means of the pins of the chip) will be 
particularly investigated. The second level of connection 
(assembly of the module on the card) will also be investigated 
in a study dedicated particularly to ball bearings. The aims of 
Chippac are also concerned with the characteristics of modules. 
The SCM model will have to be able to encapsulate a 15 x 15 mm 
chip comprising over 400 E/S, operating at over 100 MHz and 
dissipating up to 10W. The module will need to be sufficiently 
reliable to be suitable for information technology and 
telecommunications applications. One of the MCM modules on a 
ceramic substrate (MCM-C) will need to contain 32 chips, 
including 24 bare ones (connected by TAB without bossing), and 8 
encapsulated in ultraflat cases (TSOP). The external 
connections will need to operate at up to 33 Mbit/s, and the 
internal ones at up to 75 Mbit/s. The desired dissipation level 
is between 100 and 200 W. This configuration will also be 
tested on a MCM-L model (organic substrate). Another MCM-C 
model will use flip-chip technology to connect a 9-memory 
microprocessor. Finally, a MCM-L model needing to operate at 
around 1.5 GHz in very severe environmental conditions will also 
be tested.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Walter Kroell, head of the German </F>
Aerospace Research Institute (DLR), by Norbert Lossau, place and 
date not specified: "Farewell to Space? That Would Make the 
Crisis More Acute"; first paragraph is DIE WELT introduction] 
  [Text] Professor Walter Kroell (55), head of the German 
Aerospace Research Institute in Cologne, sees a hazard for the 
German economy in the mass layoffs occurring in the aerospace 
industry: "These are the jobs of the future. If they are lost, 
there will be a severe problem," he says in this WELT interview. 
"The public does not yet realize that both key technologies and 
the means for securing our very existence are at stake." 
Norbert Lossau spoke to Walter Kroell. 
  [Lossau] Mass layoffs are occurring in the German aerospace 
industry. What do you see as the cause of this trend? 
  [Kroell] The aerospace industry is in fact in a very 
critical 
situation. In the aviation sector this is a result of excess 
capacity. A ruthless price war is being waged. Contracts are 
being canceled, and capacity is thus not fully taken up, even in 
successful firms, such as the European Airbus. A second factor 
is the drastic cut in military contracts as a result of 
worldwide detente, which from all other points of view can only 
be welcomed. The critical situation in the space sector results 
largely from the fact that -- pursuant to ESA [European Space 
Agency] Council of Ministers decisions -- capacities built up 
over a fairly long period must now be significantly cut back. 
The development program for the European Hermes space plane was 
canceled in 1993; the "free-flier" planned under the Columbus 
program had been given up even before that. All we are left 
with is the debate on the role of a dock-on laboratory module 
for an international space station. The financial, political, 
and programming framework lacks stability and continuity. 
  [Lossau] So, first and foremost, you identify the 
instability 
of political conditions as the root cause of the German space 
industry's weakness. 
  [Kroell] It is true that the political situation is 
difficult: Priorities have to be set. In the ultimate analysis, 
however, the issue is: What priority is to be assigned to 
research and technology in general, and to aerospace research 
and technology in particular, with a view to safeguarding the 
German economy? 
  [Lossau] How important is the aerospace industry to the 
German economy? 
  [Kroell] If you look at the United States, Japan, or even 
South Korea, Taiwan, or Indonesia, you will see that these 
countries' state programs pronounce aerospace research and 
technology to be key technologies of the future and draw the 
logical conclusions. NASA's aviation research budget, for 
instance, rose by 30 percent from 1992 to 1994. 
  [Lossau] Why is space a future technology? 
  [Kroell] Because many problems can only be solved with help 
from the aerospace sector. Aerospace's contribution to solving 
traffic, environment, climate, and energy problems will be 
indispensable. Satellites are needed for weather forecasting 
and international crisis management; the development of 
satellite communications will continue; satellite-based 
navigation and mobile telephony are areas whose significance is 
constantly increasing. 
  [Lossau] So are we missing out on a major technology while 
other countries are investing in it? 
  (Kroell] We are indeed running the risk of losing our 
ability 
to compete and collaborate in these major fields. Other 
European countries, too, Italy and Spain for instance, face 
particular financial problems that are having repercussions on 
their space sector commitments, but, generally speaking, space 
is regarded as a particularly significant area of technology in 
Europe. 
  [Lossau] Why is it that aerospace enjoys particularly high 
status in France? 
  [Kroell] Germany currently spends about 1.8 billion German 
marks [DM] a year on space, whereas France spends nearly DM3.2 
billion. It enjoys higher status in France because aviation and 
space are widely recognized there as technologies of the future. 
Moreover, the French regard aviation and space as matters of 
national identity, an attitude completely alien to Germany. 
Here, the tendency is rather to set things in motion, to reach 
a high standard, maybe even a leading position, and then to keep 
casting doubt on them. Perhaps this is a feature of the German 
mentality. 
  [Lossau] Are we more hostile to technology than the French? 
  [Kroell] No. I believe that the value that German public 
opinion sets on aerospace is at the crux of the matter. The 
general public does not yet realize that both key technologies 
and the means for securing our very existence are at stake. If 
we want to withstand international competition in the aerospace 
sector, we need continuity, persistence, and stable long-term 
framework conditions, financial conditions included: Rather 
more modest figures if necessary, provided they remain stable in 
the longer term. 
  [Lossau] Is Germany losing jobs with future prospects while 
other countries, such as France, are setting long-term 
safeguards on them? 
  [Kroell] Jobs in the aerospace sector are jobs with a 
high-technology orientation and prospects for the future. If we 
cut them back while other countries, primarily the United States 
and countries in southeast Asia, are creating them, we shall 
face serious problems in the future. Generally speaking, I 
believe it can be said that we shall only render the crisis more 
acute in the future if we cut back on research and technology 
posts in the present situation. 
<H5>  Know-How for Americans and Russians </H5>
  [Lossau] The reaction to every funding cut has always been: 
In that case, we shall only do so much; even that is still good 
research. Have the space sector's prestige and effectiveness 
suffered from this attitude too? 
  [Kroell] It undoubtedly detracts from the space sector's 
image. Both the man in the street and the technical expert look 
for tangible results. They rightly expect that once things have 
been initiated in a climate of consensus, they should be brought 
to a proper and speedy conclusion. Constantly adjusting or 
revising plans gives a bad impression. Of course, the space 
community can only spend the money that it actually receives. 
If money that is promised, for developing Hermes, for instance, 
is subsequently not forthcoming, the blame should not be laid at 
the door of the space sector. 
  [Lossau] Are there areas of aerospace in which Germany 
enjoys 
a technological lead? 
  [Kroell] Yes, several. The DLR and its German partners are 
the undisputed world leaders in space robotics. We have 
received interesting offers for the use of our know-how in 
future American and Russian projects. The DLR is also a leader, 
and an internationally sought-after partner, in teleoperation 
and telemanipulation. Another of our strong points lies in 
sensor, camera, and radar scanner development, a concrete 
example being the Mars cameras to be used on a Russian mission 
to Mars. The Americans, too, acknowledge the lead that this 
technology has gained. 
  [Lossau] You mention robotics. Are we actually so far ahead 
of the Americans in this field that they would have preferred to 
prevent the German Rotex robot from flying the D2 mission by 
setting particularly high requirements for it in terms of 
spaceworthiness? 
  [Kroell] Rotex has not only caused a sensation but has given 
rise to some concern in both the United States and Japan. There 
is no question about it: The Americans themselves admit to 
concern that Germany manifestly has its nose out in front in 
this important field of technology, the use of automation and 
robotics in space. 
  [Lossau] Hence the attempt to prevent space trials with the 
German robot? 
  [Kroell] I can confirm that the Americans set extremely high 
spaceworthiness requirements for Rotex and that it was difficult 
to demonstrate that it met them. But we succeeded. I cannot 
say that the Americans set greater hurdles on purpose. 
  [Lossau] When the German D2 astronauts visited Houston, I 
had 
the feeling that they were merely regarded as the Americans' 
junior partners. 
  [Kroell] The Americans and Russians are undoubtedly the 
leading space nations. NASA has an incomparably greater wealth 
of experience than we do, indeed it spends on quite a different 
scale. To this extent I find it understandable that the DLR was 
regarded as a junior partner on the shuttle flights. But the 
lesser partner's achievements have earned the Americans' high 
regard, not only for our astronauts' competence and 
professionalism but for the DLR Space Center's operational 
handling in Oberpfaffenhofen. However, it would not be 
realistic for us to claim to be a partner of equal weight and 
equal importance to the Americans and Russians, especially as 
far as manned missions are concerned. 
<H5>  New Tasks Waiting for Ariane-5 </H5>
  [Lossau] In 1993, the Europeans, and consequently the 
Germans 
as well, were taken by surprise by an agreement between the 
Americans and Russians to operate a space station together, 
whereas there had been plans for years previously for a joint 
space station with the Europeans. How do you see this turn of 
events? 
  [Kroell] It would undoubtedly have been desirable and proper 
to give the Europeans earlier notice of these discussions. But 
one never knows when agreements of this type may come about 
during discussions at top political level in the midst of many 
other, perhaps weightier topics. At the moment, it indeed looks 
as though we shall arrive at a joint European, American, and 
Russian project. This joint space effort can only be welcomed, 
and indeed it is what Germany has always been calling for. So, 
although the approach itself may leave something to be desired, 
everything points to Europe and Germany having a share in the 
space station. 
  [Lossau] ESA's latest plans envisage a manned space capsule, 
to be launched into space with an Ariane rocket. Is this the 
first step toward independence from the Americans? 
  [Kroell] I believe Europe must make a major point of 
incorporating the Ariane rocket into the overall concept of a 
space station of the type we have mentioned and using it as a 
transport vehicle. However, if we want to do this, we must 
consider whether the transfer vehicles should be manned or 
unmanned. I think it would therefore be useful at this point to 
carry out studies to examine whether and with what modifications 
Ariane-5 can be used to serve the space station. The manned 
capsule is one of the options that we can study in terms of any 
advantages that it might offer, its technical feasibility, and 
its financeability. 
  [Lossau] When is the earliest we can expect a decision? 
  [Kroell] Not before the end of 1995. 
  [Lossau] How much less than Hermes will it cost to develop 
this capsule? 
  [Kroell] That I do not know. This is one of the aspects that 
the planned studies set out to clarify: What should a capsule 
of this type look like in detail? What would it cost? How does 
it fit into the international scenario? These are questions 
that require intensive study. In any case, the capsule would 
have to cost substantially less than Hermes, otherwise it would 
not be a realistic alternative. 
  [Lossau] The politicians are the ones who set your finance 
framework ... 
  [Kroell] Correct. As I have said, the important thing is 
medium-term stability, even if the finance framework turns out 
to be more modest than originally anticipated. Then we shall 
have to see which priorities can be met within that framework. 
One thing is clear: With significantly less money we cannot 
achieve the initial targets, otherwise it would mean that the 
targets had not been defined in serious terms. 
<H5>  Data From Space Slumbering in Archives </H5>
  [Lossau] Back to Ariane, whose image emerged from the 
spectacular false start somewhat battered: How seriously do you 
take the danger of its success being completely undermined by 
cheaper competition from Russia, China, or Japan? 
  [Kroell] The risk is real, especially in the absence of fair 
international competitive conditions. If there were a real open 
market with all the competitors enjoying equal opportunities, 
without "political prices," I should not be worried about Ariane. 
  [Lossau] But rockets -- just like CD-players -- can be 
produced more cheaply in countries with low wage levels. 
  [Kroell] There is no mass production for low-wage countries 
to date in the aerospace industry. Russia is a low-wage 
country, but just look at the hosts of people who, I grant you, 
work for low individual wages but, taken together, make for high 
overall costs. CD-players are a different matter: The 
international market and competition are open. There is no open 
market in rocket technology, nor do I see how one could come 
into being in the near future. If the Russians or Chinese say: 
Whatever the Western price is, we shall deliver rockets 20 or 
30 percent more cheaply, the price is not the result of low 
payroll costs but of political calculation. 
  [Lossau] But the United States has already purchased some 
cheap flights from the Russians and even from the Chinese. 
  [Kroell] Not only the United States. If things are allowed 
to continue much further in this direction, with transport 
capacity being purchased wherever it is cheapest -- just think 
of the Russians' massive excess capacity -- Ariane will find it 
difficult to compete. 
  [Lossau] Can this issue only be settled at the political 
level? 
  [Kroell] Yes. Framework agreements on the subject and quota 
arrangements are being negotiated. 
  [Lossau] Apart from Rotex, can you give other examples to 
illustrate the significance of the manned D2 mission? 
  [Kroell] Another outstanding example is the DLR-designed 
Moms 
camera. During the mission, over 7 million square kilometers of 
the earth were photographed in exceptional quality. Most of the 
material and life science experiments performed during the 
mission are still being evaluated, but a number of excellent 
results are emerging here too. 
  [Lossau] What will the Moms photographs be used for? 
  [Kroell] They are stereoscopic images with high resolution 
to 
just a few meters. First and foremost, these images are 
immensely useful for cartography, especially for parts of the 
world that are not readily accessible or are completely 
inaccessible. They also show vegetation cover very clearly, 
distinguishing between bush, grassland, and cereal farming 
areas, and they identify the water collecting areas in karstic 
regions. They are also useful when undertaking 
three-dimensional terrain reconstructions. 
  [Lossau] A practically unmeasurable amount of data has been 
beamed to earth by satellites or brought back by manned space 
missions. The vast bulk of this data is slumbering unused on 
magnetic tapes. Does this not rather shake the credibility of 
claims that there is a constant need to collect more data? 
  [Kroell] The problem, and the challenge, here is to broaden 
the base using the wealth of information from space. The fact 
that this data has not yet been used to the desired extent by no 
means renders it worthless. It rather calls for greater efforts 
to organize use of the data more effectively. 
  [Lossau] Is the fact that most of this data is lying unused 
in the archives attributable to lack of money or lack of 
interest on the part of researchers? 
  [Kroell] There are potential users who do not have the 
money, 
and there are others who have not yet realized that there is 
massive potential to be tapped here. What we need to do is 
activate and organize the user community. The DLR receives the 
data collected by all the main and, in the future, eastern civil 
satellites, and can process it according to user requirements. 
The problem is the end-use of this data. Money is needed to 
solve this problem. 
<H5>  It Would Be Dangerous To Break the Thread </H5>
  [Lossau] In Germany we do not hear much about the use of 
satellites for verification purposes. Is there not major work 
to be done in this field in the future? 
  [Kroell] Undoubtedly. Our Defense Ministry has not yet gone 
in for space activities, but I am convinced that the potential 
for peacekeeping and crisis management from space will acquire 
increasing importance and that we, too, cannot afford to deny 
ourselves access to this potential in a context of international 
cooperation. 
  [Lossau] In future there will be less money available for 
manned space missions. Do you merely put this down to 
straightened finances, or has the need for research capacity in 
space declined as well? 
  [Kroell] Straightened finances, primarily, and also a 
resetting of priorities within this financial framework. There 
will be no national manned space projects in the foreseeable 
future, and this is fully in line with the desire for 
internationalization. We must therefore adjust our capability 
in this area accordingly. I believe it is a good thing to set 
space priorities in the environment and earth observation sphere 
and in particular technologies, such as robotics and 
telecommunications, regardless of budget size. However, I would 
also regard completely discontinuing work on manned space flight 
as fatal. We would run the risk of losing our hard-won 
competence as international partners. Losing our competence in 
aerospace research and technology would break the thread in a 
major field, it would mean giving up a strategically important 
area of research and technology, and it would consequently have 
a detrimental effect on the German economy. 
  [Lossau] Despite the general crisis and shifting of 
priorities away from manned space flight, do you believe man 
will actually fly to Mars? 
  [Kroell] This is without doubt an issue that will not be 
accorded top priority over the next few decades. At the moment 
there are more pressing problems for the space sector to help 
solve. Mars missions are thus not one of our foremost interests 
or concerns. However, I have no doubt that one day -- albeit 
not in our time -- such missions will become a reality.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Research, Education, and </F>
Training Programme News"] 
  [Text] SPRINT -- Strategic Programme for Innovation and 
Technology Transfer. The Council has officially decided to 
extend the above programme until December 31st 1994 -- it was 
due to run from 1989 to 1993. The Council envisages the future 
integration of SPRINT into the Fourth Framework Programme for 
RTD. SPRINT's `Lines of Action' have also been amended. 
Briefly these are: 
<H5>  Networks </H5>
  1. Strengthening Intra-EC Networks for innovation 
  -- consolidating and developing existing networks, 
particularly those involving technology and innovation 
management consultants, sectoral collective research centres, 
and innovative financing institutions; 
  -- the formation of new networks, particularly between 
contract-research organisations, engineering consultants, 
quality and value-analysis specialists, etc. 
  -- strengthening intra EC cooperation between 
research/industry and university/industry interfaces, and 
between technopoles and science parks; 
  2. Network Support Measures 
  -- information actions of various kinds across national 
frontiers and between regions, in close liaison with the COMETT 
[Community Program for Education and Teaching in the Field of 
Technology] programme; 
  -- enhancing the effectiveness of networks, inter alia by 
visits and professional exchanges, enhancing the transnational 
impact of technology exhibitions, identifying `best practice' 
with respect to technology transfer, and through specific 
measures to help less favoured regions to participate in 
intra-EC networks; 
  -- the launching of innovations emerging from networks by 
improving the dialogue between sources of funding, technical 
experts and innovators identified by the networks. 
<H5>  Support for Specific Projects </H5>
  These include: 
  -- encouraging the application of generic technologies to 
target industrial sectors in the less favoured regions or in 
regions of industrial decline; 
  -- heightening awareness of these technologies and helping 
to 
train companies adopting them, emphasising the transnational 
element; 
  -- providing technical support for companies, especially 
SMEs, potentially able to use these technologies, through 
technology transfer networks and advanced-technology centres; 
  Twin approaches can be followed: 
  1) identifying technologies suitable for widespread adoption 
in regions of lagging development or industrial decline, and 
promoting the use of these technologies in the sectors concerned; 
  2) identifying a need common to a group of companies in a 
given sector or region where the companies are prepared to 
finance the solution. This encourages the identification and 
possible adaptation of available technologies to deal with the 
need detected. 
  The planned projects shall act as a catalyst, and must also: 
  -- be model projects in that they employ a comprehensive 
'systemic' approach to the introduction of technological change, 
covering, for example, management, training, industrial design, 
and market assessment; 
  -- provide an optimum combination of skills across frontiers 
and between regions and partners of differing special skills; 
  -- involve industrial sectors or technologies chosen to 
guarantee a significant economic impact; 
  -- help to reduce regional disparities in the availability 
of 
technologies; 
  -- be based as far as possible on existing infrastructures; 
  -- include provision for follow-up and evaluation, based in 
particular on stated and readily verifiable quantitative aims; 
  -- ensure feedback of the experience gained; preferably 
directly by the companies benefiting from the scheme, in order 
to maximise the multiplier effect. 
<H5>  Improving the Understanding of the Process of Innovation </H5>
  -- Monitoring innovation in Europe (European Innovation 
Monitoring System) and evaluation of support measures; 
  -- Strengthening concertation and the exchange of experience 
between Member States and the Commission in the field of 
innovation policy and technology transfer. 
  A second Annex outlines a budget for the SPRINT programme 
(1989-94), allowing expenditure of Ecu 41.5m for strengthening 
networks, Ecu 20m for accompanying measures, Ecu 34m for 
specific projects for intra-community innovation transfer, and 
Ecu 13.5m for monitoring innovation and concertation between the 
Member States. Total budget, Ecu 109m.

  [Text] The new Max Planck Institute of the Biology of 
Infection is due to begin work in the eastern part of Berlin at 
the beginning of 1994 and to move into new premises close to the 
Charite in 1998 at the latest. The establishment of this 
institute is regarded as a rare scientific opportunity to devote 
appropriate attention to this area, which is of importance in 
terms of both basic research and medical practice. 
  A third of all fatalities in the world can be traced to 
diseases caused by microbial pathogens. One and a half billion 
people -- primarily in the third world, suffer from the 19 
infectious diseases (excluding AIDS), for which American doctors 
consider new vaccines must be developed as a matter of priority. 
  The methods used in molecular and cytobiology, immunology, 
epidemiology, and structural chemistry now make it possible to 
arrive at a better understanding of the biology of the infection 
process and, consequently, at new approaches to the prevention 
and treatment of infectious diseases. Research into the biology 
of infection has thus increased considerably worldwide, 
although, apart from exceptions such as virus-dependent 
infectious diseases, it has not yet attained an internationally 
competitive level in Germany. 
  With the founding of a Max Planck Institute of the Biology 
of 
Infection to carry out multidisciplinary research the MPG [Max 
Planck Society] has taken a decisive step toward establishing 
this field in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
  By the time the institute is complete, it will comprise four 
departments: 
  -- Immunology (headed by Professor Stefan E.A. Kaufmann), 
which will primarily study the interactions between immune 
systems and microbial pathogens, with particular reference to 
defensive and pathogenic mechanisms; 
  -- Molecular Genetics, which will work on the molecular 
basis 
of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and identify and 
analyze the factors responsible for virulence; 
  -- Cytobiology, which will focus primarily on the invasion 
of 
host cells by microbes and on topics relating to intracellular 
proliferation and cell-to-cell spreading. Methods provided by 
cytobiology, electron microscopy, and biochemistry will be used 
to study communication between pathogen and host cell; 
  -- Epidemiology, which will set out to identify virulence 
and 
resistance characteristics relevant to the spread of infectious 
diseases and to study microecosystems involved in infectious 
diseases. 
  The plan from the outset is to include clinical research as 
an integral part of the institute's overall approach and to 
recruit clinicians specializing in infectious diseases to work 
with research teams. Programs of research into infectious 
diseases in developing countries will also be drawn up and 
undertaken either in collaboration with the research 
laboratories already established in the countries concerned or 
by setting up field stations there. It is also planned to 
extend the institute's scientific range by establishing 
independent teams of young scientists to work on topics that 
complement the research undertaken in the institute's own 
departments.

<F P=106> [Article by Martin S. Lambeck: "Wissmann: Decision on </F>
Transrapid in March"] 
  [Text] The Federal Cabinet will decide at the end of March 
this year whether or not to build the Transrapid fast maglev 
line between Berlin and Hamburg, Federal Transport Minister 
Matthias Wissmann (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) has told 
DIE WELT. He also said that he intended to introduce the maglev 
railway bill in the Bundestag before the end of the current 
parliamentary term. The coalition parties approve of the 
project, so it may safely be assumed that the bill will be 
passed. 
  "I want work on building the Transrapid to begin within 
three 
or four years," said Wissmann. If the high-technology line were 
built in 1997 and 1998, it could enter service between 2002 and 
2004. The idea was to bring the train into the centers of both 
cities on Bundesbahn tracks. Wissmann expects the Transrapid 
and the work associated with it to create about 10,000 new jobs: 
"The Transrapid is a symbol of our capacity not only to develop 
advanced technology in Germany but to apply it for all to see," 
said the minister. 
  In view of mounting interest in the supertrain on the world 
markets, he said, it was particularly important for the 
Transrapid actually to run between Germany's capital and its 
second-largest city. No time should therefore be wasted. 
"Interest is mounting abroad. We currently have about five 
years' technological lead over the Japanese with the 
Transrapid," the minister reported. The Transrapid can reach a 
top speed of over 400 kilometers per hour and would complete the 
285-km journey in under an hour. Track costs are currently put 
at 5.6 billion German marks [DM], and the fare is estimated at 
DM90 to 100.

  [Text] The Dresden Institute of Polymer Research (IPF) was 
opened on 6 December by Secretary of State to the BMFT [Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology] Dr. Gebhard Ziller and the 
Science Minister of the Free State of Saxony, Professor 
Hans-Joachim Meyer. As one of the "Blue List" institutes, it is 
financed half by the BMFT and half by the Free State of Saxony 
(annual budget for 1993: 26.3 million German marks). With its 
232 employees, the institute is one of the largest and most 
productive polymer research facilities in the Federal Republic 
of Germany. 
  The institute's work focuses primarily on 
application-oriented basic research, major fields being: 
  -- polymer synthesis and characterization; 
  -- interface phenomena in polymers and multiphase systems 
containing polymer matrix (with particular reference to polymer 
blends and reinforced polymers); 
  -- polymer surface modification; and 
  -- shaping, processing, and inspection of polymeric 
materials. 
  The institute is already working with numerous firms in the 
plastics, automotive, and lacquer industries, mainly on the 
development of environment-friendly lacquers for automobile 
bodies. It is also working jointly with AKZO AG on the further 
development of dialysis membranes for artificial kidneys and the 
monitoring of their production. 
  Professor Hans-Joerg Jacobasch, a scientist of international 
renown, was appointed scientific director of the Institute of 
Polymer Research, thus acknowledging the value of his work to 
date as head of the IPF in a commissary capacity.

  [Text] During the induction of Professor Hans-Juergen 
Warnecke as the new chairman of the Fraunhofer Society (FhG), 
Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger acknowledged the work 
of the outgoing chairman, Professor Max Syrbe, in an address 
given before leading representatives of the scientific, 
industrial, and political spheres. His chairmanship had 
consciously oriented the FhG toward entrepreneurial goals. The 
FhG's mission as the link between science and industry was of 
growing importance. In the FhG, Germany had a successful model 
for breaking down barriers between its roles as a scientific 
country and an industrial country. 
  The FhG was thus making a major contribution to raising the 
productivity of the German economy. The rapid conversion of 
outstanding basic research findings into products on markets was 
a priority aspect of research and technology policy in the 
Federal Republic for the coming years. 
  A glance at the FhG's business trend gives impressive 
evidence of its success: The number of institutes rose from 15 
in 1965 to the current figure of nearly 50. Its overall budget 
rose from 20 million German marks [DM] in 1965 to the current 
sum of nearly DM1 billion. The FhG now faces the task of 
consolidating and building on this business success over the 
coming years. This will mean raising the industrial earnings 
share of the FhG's overall budget above the current figure of 
about DM200 million. 
  The FhG has made a considerable contribution to the creation 
of a unified research scene in Germany since 1989. The Federal 
Government welcomes the decision that the FhG Senate took on 27 
October 1993 to make 16 of the total of 22 Fraunhofer institutes 
and regional branches in the new federal laender eligible for 
funding on an indefinite basis at this early date, thus 
safeguarding over 1,000 permanent research and development posts. 
  The FhG facilities in the new federal laender fully lived up 
to the expectations placed in them in 1992. With 22 percent of 
earnings, they exceeded the 15 percent target assigned to them 
by a long chalk. The institutes scored a great success with the 
acquisition of project funds totaling approximately DM24 
million, primarily from the Federal Government but in part from 
the governments of the new laender as well. Their high rate of 
participation in joint projects shows that these facilities are 
capable of holding their own against competition from their 
western counterparts as well. The Fraunhofer facilities' 
performance of DFG [German Research Association] projects and 
participation in special research programs in particular also 
provided proof of their scientific quality. 
  The Fraunhofer facilities were also successful in obtaining 
contracts from private industry: Of their overall contract 
earnings totaling DM14 million, two-thirds came from western 
companies and one-third from firms in the new federal laender. 
The Fraunhofer facilities have become a major factor in the 
R&amp;D 
infrastructure in the new laender, where they are contributing 
to reconstruction.

  [Text] The reduction to the base funding of the TNO 
[Applied Netherlands Research Center] will, to a large extent, 
no longer be implemented. The TNO's subsidy from the Ministry 
of Science and Education originally was supposed to have been 
reduced from one percent in 1994 to five percent in 1998. The 
one percent reduction slated for 1994 will be implemented. 
However, State Secretary Cohen is willing to look for other 
financial means to offset the reduced subsidies slated for 1995 
to 1998 as follows: 1995, 1.335 million guilders (G); 1996, 
G2.671 million; 1997, G4.006 million; and 1998, G5.342 million. 
  All of this was communicated in the annual subsidy letter, 
which explains the base subsidies as well as the target 
subsidies the TNO receives from different departments. The 
reduction was the result of a cabinet decision to diminish the 
number of subsidies. During the budget negotiations, the second 
Chamber made it clear that in this case the effect -- less 
investment in knowledge infrastructure -- would differ from the 
goal -- a reduction in subsidies.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Higher Education and Research </F>
Minister Francois Fillon by Jean-Paul Croize; date, place not 
given: "Research Seeks To Take a Deep Breath"; first paragraph 
is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Society, in its determination to develop, must do 
more to exploit the opportunities offered by science: Investing 
in research seems essential if France is to enhance its 
potential in coping with economic and industrial developments on 
both a European and a global scale, especially if we finally 
manage to better "marry" our researchers and our companies. 
These are the three key findings of the "Report on the Trends 
of the Major Aims of French Research" presented yesterday by 
Robert Daulray, High Commissioner for Atomic Energy, to Francois 
Fillon, Minister of Higher Education and Research. This 
document, running to some 60 pages and commissioned last 
September by the minister, will now be circulated to around 
30,000 people, who will use it as the basis for a "major 
national consultation" launched today by Francois Fillon. 
  This consultation exercise, based also on six thematic 
seminars to be held in different regions between now and 
mid-March, will be synthesized in a national debate on 9 April; 
this will be followed by the drafting during May of the final 
summative document, which will be used as the framework for 
parliamentary discussion on the future of French research, 
scheduled by the minister for the end of the spring session of 
the National Assembly, next June. Replying to our questions, he 
explains why he considers it "indispensable" to take the pulse 
of the French scientific community, so as to help it reach the 
end of the century in good shape. 
  [LE FIGARO] Why undertake such national consultation on the 
aims of research now? 
  [FILLON] Firstly, because this has not been done for 10 
years, despite the major changes which have taken place since 
then in our society and in research. At the geopolitical level, 
take the disintegration of the former USSR, or, at the global 
level, the importance now attached to environmental problems. 
Take, also, the very rapid growth in the numbers of students, 
who should be considered not only in terms of their interests 
and abilities, but also in terms of the constraints of the labor 
market, without neglecting the research role of our universities. 
  Next, I feel it is important for France to have a more 
accurate perception of its scientific resources, and of the 
major steps it can and must take during the next few years, for 
the same reason as the United States, Japan, Germany, or indeed 
Britain. 
  [LE FIGARO] What should be the role of the state in 
scientific research? 
  [FILLON] My main criticism of French policy in this area 
over the past five years is the fact that we have not managed to 
define strong priorities -- for pump-priming programs suitable 
for stimulating research in a changed national and international 
context; for launching basic research programs today, not only 
to prepare the applied research which tomorrow's companies will 
need, but also to respond to advances in this same applied 
research. 
  The state is presently going too far in reducing its 
essential role to allocating funding which is growing ever 
larger, but which unfortunately is increasingly absorbed by 
major research bodies, rather than by research activities 
themselves. I believe it is time we found the way to target our 
research -- with all the consultation that requires, of course 
-- instead of being satisfied just to finance it, while having 
nothing, or virtually nothing, to say about it. Neither is it 
normal -- the research establishments themselves complain about 
this -- for the state to be unable to take selective decisions 
on supporting a particular laboratory which has just achieved a 
major breakthrough in a field which is becoming highly 
significant for our country... 
<H5>  Building Bridges Between Laboratories </H5>
  [LE FIGARO] The preliminary report which launched this 
consultation refers to inflexibility over basic research. What 
is the cause of this, and how can it be cured? 
  [FILLON] Though it has not yet reached paralysis, we can 
certainly speak of disturbing inflexibility. Its symptoms are 
varied: Inability properly to assess needs, or difficulty in 
properly allocating efforts over the medium term, leading to 
difficulty in developing... 
  What causes this? The cause lies, once again, in the 
difficulties faced by institutions in properly developing their 
programs. Another cause is the doubts facing researchers, and, 
more generally, laboratories, over their ability to question, 
and, if necessary, abandon existing activities. It is also 
worth mentioning the problem faced by French researchers in 
finding the right level in particular fields, such as the "new 
frontier" which now is as much at the level of the infinitely 
complex as of the infinitely large or small. It seems that 
there are not enough bridges between laboratories where 
interdisciplinary research is concerned, such as -- to take a 
specific example -- global climate change. What do we do? 
This national consultation should analyze present modes of 
operation, and, hopefully, result in the basis for solutions. 
<H5>  A Very Longstanding Deficit </H5>
  The preliminary report which launched this consultation 
refers to serious causes: For example, high-school education, 
which is claimed to favor the abstract at the expense of the 
concrete. We shall also have to look into problems which have 
been discussed for a long time: The insufficient mobility of 
researchers, their reluctance to take advantage of their job 
security so as to take risks, or even the lack of pump-priming 
funding, such as invitations to bid, for example. 
  [LE FIGARO] How does our private-sector research compare 
with 
that of other industrial countries? 
  [FILLON] It is common knowledge that far less is achieved 
here in France than in the other major industrial countries. 
Where German companies provide 72 percent of research and 
development, French companies manage only 60 percent. 
  We suffer from a very longstanding deficit, linked to the 
organization of our outmoded industrial structures. Many small 
and medium-sized enterprises [SME's] have problems in gaining 
access to research. There is little contact between the public 
and private sectors over research. It is obvious that France 
needs to increase its private-sector research -- this was a 
matter of concern to my predecessors. I hope that this national 
consultation will reveal new solutions in three directions: 
Firstly, in developing modern tools, particularly through 
ANVAR, the National Agency for the Promotion of Research; then, 
in progressively fostering a research culture in many companies 
where it does not presently exist; and finally, in achieving a 
better understanding of the needs of our industries on the part 
of our research establishments. 
  [LE FIGARO] How can we enable applied research better to 
service SME's? 
  [FILLON] This can only be achieved through collective 
action, 
by the state, the private sector and local communities. For 
example, take the improvements in procedures for aiding research 
and innovation, again through such bodies as ANVAR, the creation 
or the strengthening of skills in companies -- by hiring 
engineers with greater awareness of the scope offered by 
research to develop an activity -- and the growing cooperation 
between these companies and technical education. 
  I believe that the interweaving of research activities and 
the needs of SME's must take place on a regional scale. The 
relationship between the two can be far more firmly established, 
on a person to person basis, so that needs and potential for 
development are in harmony.

<F P=106> [Article by Heinz Heck: "Krueger: Funding Is Showing </F>
Results -- Bonn Provides Several Hundred Million Marks To Boost 
Research in East"] 
  [Text] Although the cutbacks in the research and 
development (R&amp;D) work force in the new federal laender have 
slowed down over the last year or two, they have not yet stopped 
altogether. Research Minister Paul Krueger said before today's 
Bundestag research debate that the Federal Government would 
therefore "not relax its considerable commitment to R&amp;D 
funding 
in industry in the new laender." 
  Krueger nevertheless rejected the claim by the Halle 
Economic 
Research Institute (IWH) that the R&amp;D work force had been cut 
from 86,000 to 10,000 between 1989 and the end of 1993 and that 
another 3,000 jobs were expected to be lost: His ministry could 
not agree with these figures. The terms of the comparison with 
an estimated 86,000 employees in the former GDR were not proper, 
as the figure of 10,000 referred solely to industry in the 
strict sense, whereas that of 86,000 took in the whole of the 
economy. 
  Krueger did not expect further heavy cuts in R&amp;D jobs: 
"On 
the contrary, the funding programs are showing results, and the 
R&amp;D work force in industry in the new laender is receiving 
increasing support -- over 50 percent -- from state funding 
measures. The Federal Government realized early on that 
maintaining and expanding a productive industrial research 
capability would require an exceptional commitment on the part 
of the state." The range of funding measures had thus been 
extended back at the beginning of 1992 and considerably more 
funds provided for industrial R&amp;D in the new laender. 
  Krueger considered even greater efforts on the part of 
government and industry necessary to make up lost ground. 
Companies from the original laender were setting up research 
stations in the new ones, and this, together with the funding 
measures sponsored by his own ministry, the Industry Ministry, 
and the governments of the new laender, should have a 
stabilizing effect on staffing levels there. The two ministries 
had set aside 740 million German marks for 1994, and additional 
funds would be forthcoming from the new laender themselves. 
  Krueger saw a strong export trade aspect in this funding, as 
"R&amp;D-intensive goods are a strong feature of German exports." 
These are goods in which R&amp;D expenditure represents over 3.5 
percent of the sale price. They gave Germany a considerable 
trade surplus each year, 48 percent of German industrial exports 
being R&amp;D intensive (1992). 
  Numerous east German firms were still not internationally 
competitive with their products, so a greater orientation toward 
product innovation was required. Industry in the new laender 
would need support in developing products based on selected key 
technologies. "This will also contribute to stabilizing the 
R&amp;D 
work force."

  [Text] On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet declared itself 
in favor of building the Transrapid magnetic levitation railway 
from Hamburg to Berlin on the basis of a new financing strategy 
submitted by industry. Speaking at a news conference held 
jointly with Research Minister Krueger (CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union]) in Bonn, Transport Minister Wissmann (CDU) 
stated that the Federal Government had "given a favorable 
reading" to the report, which envisages financing the 
8.9-million German mark [DM] project overwhelmingly by private 
investment. The building go-ahead will be given by the end of 
March, and Federal Chancellor Kohl has made it known that he 
wants all matters of detail settled by the end of February. 
  Krueger and Wissman spoke of a "signal for Germany as a 
leading center of industry" and of a sign of the country's 
future viability. Magnetic levitation was power-saving, quiet, 
and safe; Germany, moreover, still had five to 10 years' lead 
over the United States and Japan in this technology. Building 
work on the line, on which Bonn had agreed back in 1992, is 
scheduled to begin in or around 1996, and trial operation in 
2003 or 2004. It will run over a distance of 284 kilometers 
from Hamburg Central Station and Hamburg- Billwerder Moorfleet 
to Berlin via Schwerin and Spandau. Journey time will be just 
under one hour, with a train leaving in each direction every 10 
minutes. Wissmann said that the ticket price could not yet be 
specified, as it would depend on the amount of custom attracted. 
Krueger said that, at today's fare levels, an "indicative" fare 
of DM90 to 100 was likely. The project will create at least 
10,000 jobs overall, 4,000 of them in the structural steel 
engineering industry alone. 
  Wissmann said that the decisive factor in obtaining the 
Federal Government's agreement had been the industry's new 
financing strategy, which envisaged a substantially higher 
contribution on the part of industry than the initial plan, 
submitted in March. According to the new proposals, track 
ownership and operation would be kept strictly separate, the 
Federal Government taking responsibility for the track and the 
operating company being organized on private lines. In addition 
to the main parties involved, which are Daimler-Benz/AEG, 
Siemens, Thyssen Industries, the Deutsche Bank, and the 
Investment Bank for Reconstruction, the plan is for the 
shareholders to include insurance companies and the Dyckerhoff 
&amp; 
Widmann, Hochtief, and Philipp Holzmann construction firms. 
Industry, banks, and private investors will contribute DM1.2 
billion in venture capital, and the Bundesbahn and Lufthansa 
will each put up DM150 million. The industry proposes a 20 
percent tax preference for private investors along Berlin loan 
lines, as no dividend can be expected for many years. In 
addition to the DM1.5- billion shareholders' equity, loans to 
the tune of DM3.3 billion will be obtained. Third-party funds 
will be refinanced solely out of profits, without state 
guarantees. 
  The Federal Government is to bear the investment costs for 
the track, which will amount to approximately DM5.6 billion, 
although industry is offering to contribute: The operating 
company is offering to pay the track company the interest and 
repayment installments on loans totaling DM2.4 billion out of 
the track rental fee, after which the Federal Government would 
be directly liable for only DM3.2 billion. Winfriend Haastert, 
board chairman of Thyssen Industries AG Henschel, stated that 
building an ICE [intercity express] line between Hamburg and 
Berlin would cost more than the Transrapid line. 
  Coalition deputies such as Kurt Faltlhauser (CSU [Christian 
Social Union]), Christian Lenzer (CDU), and Horst Friedrich (FDP 
[Free Democratic Party of Germany]) spoke in support of the plan 
and called for rapid implementation. SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] industry spokesman Uwe Jens welcomed the 
project as well. SPD deputies Michael Mueller and Siegrun 
Klemmer, however, were against the "Transrapid adventure," 
suggesting that the billions would be better spent modernizing 
the railways.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Trepte of the General Administration </F>
of the Max Planck Society: "On the Road Toward a Single 
Research Scene"; first paragraph is MPG SPIEGEL introduction] 
  [Text] Three years after German unification, the Max 
Planck Society feels that the time has come to review its 
achievements in the new federal laender and, where necessary, to 
adjust its funding policy for the accession area to take account 
of developments to date. This funding policy is based on a 
program drawn up by the society's governing bodies in the late 
fall of 1990 and comprising (as summarized below) two components 
or -- to put it simply -- a priority program devised to 
implement fast-acting measures and a long-term program 
envisaging the founding of Max Planck institutes. 
  The strategy underlying the funding policy that the 
Max-Planck Society adopted for the new federal laender in 1990 
may be summarized as follows: 
  1. Priority program designed to enhance university research, 
comprising: 
  -- funding of joint research undertaken with scientists from 
the new federal laender (1990-1992), and 
  -- establishment of: 
  a) teams; 
  b) local branches of institutes; and 
  c) centers for the humanities (1991-1997). 
  2. Long-term program envisaging the founding of Max Planck 
institutes in the new federal laender. 
<H5>  Enhancing University Research </H5>
  From 1990 to 1992, the priority program was mainly used to 
help establish contacts and initial joint research projects 
between scientists from the new federal laender and scientists 
at the Max Planck institutes. In parallel with these 
initiatives, a total of 28 temporary teams were set up at seven 
universities in the course of 1992 as a means of helping enhance 
basic research there. The building modernizations needed by 
these teams are being completed in 1993, so all the teams will 
now be able to make full use of their newly refurbished premises 
and accommodation. The host universities have meanwhile 
appointed 20 team leaders, while the appointment procedure for 
six more leading scientists is at an advanced stage and is 
expected to be completed before the end of 1993. There have 
been delays with two teams, one due to the introduction of 
integrity review [Integritaetspruefung] procedures at east 
German universities and the other to the prospective leader's 
appointment to another university. The people concerned at the 
universities and ministries, the Max Planck Society, and the Max 
Planck institutes sponsoring the two teams in question are 
working on solutions to the problems that these delays are 
creating and hope to come up with alternatives by the end of the 
current year. 
<H5>  Preservation of Existing Research Capabilities </H5>
  The Science Council's recommendations that two local 
branches 
of existing Max Planck institutes be set up and seven centers 
for the humanities be established and sponsored over a limited 
period as a contribution to the reorganization of research in 
the former GDR gave an additional boost to the Max Planck 
Society's priority program in 1991. 
  The local branches of the Max Planck institutes of Plasma 
Physics and Extraterrestrial Physics began work on 1 January 
1992. 
  In 1992, the Max Planck Society, via its "New Scientific 
Project Funding Corporation Limited," which it founded in 1991, 
began establishing seven research centers for the humanities, 
recruiting the requisite staff, and arranging accommodation and 
providing administrative facilities for them, pursuant to the 
Science Council's recommendation. This work was successfully 
completed by spring 1993. The drafting of recommendations as to 
the conceptional configuration and institutional organization of 
these centers has also been completed by a committee appointed 
by the chairman of the Max Planck Society. After the Max Planck 
Society's senate had noted these recommendations in June 1993, 
they were passed on to the Science Council so that it could 
express a final opinion on them sufficiently in advance of the 
beginning of the Max Planck Society subsidiary's trusteeship of 
the centers. It is now a pressing concern to all involved that 
a decision be made as early as possible as regards the future 
development prospects of the centers and that measures be taken 
accordingly. 
  The Max Planck Society's long-term program was also enlarged 
as a result of Science Council recommendations that two Max 
Planck institutes be set up in the light of its assessment of 
non-university research in the former GDR: the Max Planck 
institutes of Microstructure Physics and Colloid and Interface 
Research. As with the recommendations regarding the priority 
program, two major concerns in this case as well have been to 
prevent the disintegration of viable research capabilities, 
though without perpetuating the old structures, and to dismantle 
excess capacities which cannot be funded albeit without 
destroying longstanding working relationships. It was therefore 
necessary not only to formulate new scientific strategies, but 
to restructure the research work itself and to draft in 
scientists from other organizations. Seven scientists from 
Germany and abroad have been appointed as directors for the top 
positions at the two Max Planck institutes. 
<H5>  Aspirations and Obstacles </H5>
  Since the start of German unification, it has been the Max 
Planck Society's desire that its specific facilities should 
contribute to the creation of a single research scene in the 
united Germany. Under its long-term program, it therefore began, 
even before the end of 1990, to discuss, select, and plan 
projects for founding institutes to cover topics that would 
effectively enhance the research scene in the new laender and at 
the same time boost the research capability of the united 
Germany as a whole. The individual elements and the 
implementation schedule up to the summer of 1993 are set out 
below. 
<H3>  Implementation of the Max Planck Society's Program to Set Up 
Research Facilities in the New Federal Laender (1991-1993) </H3>
  1. Priority Program 
  1991: Founding of 28 teams, two local branches of 
institutes, and seven humanities centers; 
  1992: Creating working facilities required for 28 teams, 
two local branches of institutes, and seven humanities centers. 
  2. Long-Term Program 
  1991: Decisions to found two MPI's* 
  -- Microstructure Physics; and 
  -- Colloid and Interface Research. 
  1992: Implementation of the 1991 decisions; 
  Decisions to found four MPI's: 
  -- Biology of Infection; 
  -- Plant Physiology; 
  -- Economic Systems; and 
  -- Physics of Complex Systems. 
  Discussion of further projects to found institutes. 
  1993: Decision to found one MPI: 
  -- History of Science. 
  Implementation of the 1992/1993 decisions. 
  Discussion of further projects to found institutes: 
  -- Neuropsychology; 
  -- Theoretical Biology; 
  -- Peptide Binding; 
  -- Physics of Gravitation; and 
  -- Research on the Enlightenment 
[Aufklaerungsforschung]** * [Max Planck institutes] ** The Max 
Planck Society committee concerned currently sees no possibility 
of implementing this project as a Max Planck institute. 
  The long-term program is based on an awareness that research 
priorities in the new federal laender cannot merely be deduced 
from the existing capabilities there but also require strategies 
that take account of the recent and latest developments in 
science and research at the international level. 
  To this end, the scientific members of the Max Planck 
Society 
submitted a total of 25 proposals for projects in 1990, 11 of 
which were finally selected according to science policy criteria 
and thoroughly discussed and assessed. The scientific 
discussions on five projects reached a positive conclusion in 
spring 1993 -- with the Max Planck Society's senate deciding to 
found an institute in each case. 
  However, for a considerable time it could not be predicted 
whether the federal and land governments would be prepared to 
finance further Max Planck Society institutes in the new laender 
to the level envisaged in the society's plans. Indeed, in 1992 
all the signs pointed to the Society having to make do with only 
a very tight financial framework far below its budget 
requirements. 
  The senate of the Max Planck Society thus found itself 
forced, in June 1992, to make the implementation of its 
decisions to found further Max Planck institutes in the new 
laender subject to a special financing reservation. The Max 
Planck Society had originally intended to begin setting up the 
majority of its newly founded institutes at the end of 1992, and 
to decide on their locations accordingly. However, the funds 
available under the society's budget for 1993 and the Federal 
Government's middle-term budget appropriations for the Max 
Planck Society in the accession area did not provide an adequate 
basis on which to proceed. 
  Then, in August 1992 -- when consideration of the 1994 
budget 
was imminent -- the Max Planck Society formerly asked the 
Federal Government and the heads of government of the original 
and new federal laender to create the conditions required to 
implement its program. This request aimed to obtain a consensus 
among the funding authorities both as to the timeframe within 
which the goal of as even as possible a distribution of Max 
Planck institutes in the united Germany could be achieved and as 
to the increase in funding that this would require over the 
following five years. 
  Being unable to wait for a reply from the federal and land 
governments, the Max Planck Society decided immediately, in 
November 1992, to proceed with the implementation of at least 
some of the decisions to found institutes, thus running a 
considerable risk. In November 1992, the senate accordingly 
decided to go ahead and set up a Max Planck Institute of the 
Biology of Infection and a Max Planck Institute of Research into 
Economic Systems and to enter into negotiations with the two 
host laender concerned. 
  Over the following months it became increasingly clear, 
particularly in the chairman's talks with the 
minister-presidents of the new laender and the Federal Minister 
of Research and Technology, that the governments of the new 
laender were in agreement with the Max Planck Society's program 
for setting up research facilities in the accession area and 
were prepared to give active support to its plans. For its 
part, the BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] 
announced an appreciable rise in its budget appropriations for 
the Max Planck Society's work in the new federal laender 
commencing 1994. 
<H5>  Further Institutes Founded and Initial Recruitment Talks Held </H5>
  It was these two parallel developments, the positive 
reaction 
of the heads of government of the new laender and the Federal 
Government's revised plans, that made it possible, in March 
1993, for the Max Planck Society's senate to present the plans 
to date for the locations of the institutes on which decisions 
had already been made and the options available for the 
locations of those still under discussion. Following this 
senate meeting, a start was made on implementing the decisions 
to found institutes that had been set aside until then, i.e.: 
  -- the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in 
the Potsdam area; 
  -- the Max Planck Institute of the Physics of Complex 
Systems 
in Dresden, and 
  -- the Max Planck Institute of the History of Science in 
Berlin. 
  This cleared the way for recruitment talks with all the 
directors-designate and targeted negotiations with the 
prospective host laender so that matters such as premises for 
the institutes and each institute's integration into the local 
scientific scene could be settled rapidly and by common accord. 
  Provided the negotiations with the future host laender can 
be 
brought to a positive conclusion in good time and the directors- 
designate accept the appointments offered to them, these five 
institutes will be able to begin work before the end of the 
current year, or at the latest in the first half of next year. 
Together with its two existing institutes, the Max Planck 
Society will then have seven institutes in the new federal 
laender and the eastern part of Berlin. 
<H5>  Plans for Five More Research Facilities </H5>
  Five more research institutes are already in an extremely 
advanced stage of scientific planning and, subject to the 
outcome of scientific discussions at the end of 1994, a start 
could be made with setting them up in the course of 1995 at the 
latest. These institute foundation projects cover: 
  -- the physics of gravitation; 
  -- theoretical biology; 
  -- neuropsychology research; 
  -- enzymology of peptide binding (Footnote 1), and 
  -- research on the European Enlightenment (Footnote 2). 
  A clear picture already exists as to the location of most of 
these facilities from the point of view of local scientific 
scene and appropriate regional distribution: The European 
Enlightenment and enzymology of peptide binding projects would 
probably be located in Halle and a Max Planck Institute of the 
Physics of Gravitation in Potsdam. Locational conditions 
appropriate for the planned Max Planck Institute of 
Neuropsychology Research have been identified in both Leipzig 
and Magdeburg, and the two cities are currently being considered 
by the committee concerned. The committee in charge of the 
projected Max Planck Institute of Theoretical Biology will 
consider two alternative host cities: Rostock and Jena. 
<H5>  Regional Distribution in the New Federal Laender </H5>
  The following regional distribution options are currently 
being considered for the two existing, five developing, and five 
planned Max Planck Society projects: Berlin 
  -- Biology of Infection and 
  -- History of Science. Brandenburg 
  -- Colloid and Interface Research; 
  -- Molecular Plant Physiology, and 
  -- Physics of Gravitation, 
  all in the Potsdam area. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 
  -- Theoretical Biology 
  in Rostock (alternative to Jena/Thuringia). Saxony 
  -- Physics of Complex Systems 
  in Dresden, and 
  -- Neuropsychology 
  in Leipzig (alternative to Magdeburg/Saxony-Anhalt). 
Saxony-Anhalt 
  -- Microstructure Physics 
  in Halle; 
  -- Enzymology of Peptide Binding 
  in Halle, and 
  -- Neuropsychology 
  in Magdeburg (alternative to Leipzig/Saxony). Thuringia 
  -- Research into Economic Systems 
  in Jena and 
  -- Theoretical Biology 
  in Jena (alternative to Rostock/Mecklenburg) 
  According to current plans, the Max Planck Society will be 
represented in the new federal laender and the eastern part of 
Berlin from 1995 onwards with a maximum of 12 and a minimum of 
10 institutes. 
  Footnotes 1. Solutions other than the founding of an 
institute are also being discussed for this facility. 2. The 
Max Planck Society committee concerned currently sees no 
possibility of implementing this project in the form of a Max 
Planck institute. However, the final decision will be made by 
the section concerned or, if appropriate, by the senate of the 
Max Planck Society at its October and November meetings this 
year.

  However, the locations established to date and those still 
under consideration for the institutes envisaged so far are not 
yet sufficient to achieve the Max Planck Society's goal of 
proportionate regional presence in the accession area. One of 
the main reasons behind this initial lack of balance is that the 
local scientific scenes, which are essential for productive Max 
Planck institutes [MPIs], differ widely in the individual 
laender. The Max Planck Society is nevertheless confident that 
its current plans to found further institutes in the new federal 
laender will bring it sufficiently close to achieving the 
desired balance in the distribution of its research facilities 
to keep the gap between the relative advantages and drawbacks of 
the individual laender, which is also seen in the original 
federal laender, within limits in the end result. 
  The Max Planck Society's future planning for the new federal 
laender is based on the long-term program that it drew up in 
1990 alongside its priority program. In it, the Max Planck 
Society identified its long-term goal as focusing on funding 
basic research in institutes of its own in the new laender as 
well. It was and remains the Max Planck Society's concern to 
contribute to the creation of a single research scene in the 
united Germany by gradually founding a relatively large number 
of institutes in the new laender. In concrete terms, for the 
Max Planck Society a single research scene means, firstly, being 
represented on the same scale, proportionally speaking, in the 
new and original federal laender and, secondly, countering the 
danger of a transfer of finance away from the new and toward the 
original laender, as threatened from 1995, when research will be 
funded on an overall basis. If it is to achieve both these 
goals, the society will need to have 15 to 20 institutes in the 
new laender by the turn of the century. 
<H5>  Planning Principles and Special Features </H5>
  To enable it to meet these targets, the Max Planck Society 
has set in motion a complex, ongoing procedure for discussing, 
founding, and building up new institutes. This procedure is 
based on the special role performed by the Max Planck Society 
within Germany's widely differentiated system of 
institutionalized research and comprises the following 
principles: 
  -- The Max Planck Society's domain is that of basic 
research, 
where it complements university research. It consequently 
relies on the existence of productive, broadly diversified 
university research (principle of subsidiarity); 
  -- The Max Planck Society supports basic research in areas 
holding out particular promise for the future but which the 
universities have not yet (adequately) taken up or which they 
cannot (adequately) cover (principle of emerging fields); 
  -- In order to fulfill its purpose, the Max Planck Society 
needs top scientists with a particular aptitude for leading its 
institutes (Harnack principle). 
  The Max Planck Society's procedure for discussing, founding, 
and setting up new research facilities, which involves a large 
number of outside experts, begins with the examination of 
proposals to found institutes and the selection of the most 
suitable topics according to a number of overriding criteria. 
This is followed by a survey of the stage reached in 
international research in the discipline concerned. The next 
steps in the procedure are to draw up and discuss the research 
strategy, to seek suitable candidates, and so on down to 
identifying the best location and acquiring equipment and 
premises for the future institute. 
  The founding of a Max Planck institute [MPI] has enormous 
consequences in institutional and staffing terms. It is not 
merely a matter of dignifying this or that research topic but of 
tying up financial resources and staff over an indefinite 
period. Last but not least, the working lives of top 
researchers are diverted to the facility. The preparatory 
procedure involved in founding an institute thus takes time, as 
it has to be extremely thorough in view of: 
  -- The financial implications inherent in the establishment 
of permanent institutes; 
  -- The time that it takes to set up the institute; and 
  -- The conditions necessary for the successful appointment 
of 
scientists at the forefront of the international field in their 
subjects. 
  The very principles on which this procedure is based tend to 
place limits on its success from within owing to: 
  -- The particular nature of the research topics, which means 
that, out of the whole range of supraregional nonuniversity 
research funding available, they require the specific facilities 
provided only by the Max Planck Society; and 
  -- The limited availability of top scientists suited to 
leading a Max Planck institute. 
  External constraints to which the procedure is subject 
depend 
firstly on the readiness of the federal and land governments to 
put up the funds needed to implement the institute projects 
given a positive assessment in this process. Other limits 
depend on the finite nature of the logistic capabilities that 
the Max Planck Society has at its disposal for setting up and 
administering new research facilities. 
<H5>  Continuous Implementation of Institute Founding Projects </H5>
  The Max Planck Society set its process for discussing the 
founding of institutes in the new federal laender in motion back 
in 1990, and it has produced the following results to date: 
  -- In 1991, the Max Planck institutes of Microstructure 
Physics (1) and Colloid and Interface Research (2) were founded 
following discussion of the Science Council's recommendations to 
this effect; 
  -- In 1992, the MPG decided to found four more Max Planck 
institutes of, respectively, the Biology of Infection (3), 
Molecular Plant Physiology (4), Research into Economic Systems 
(5), and the Physics of Complex Systems (6); 
  -- In 1993, it was decided to found the Max Planck Institute 
of the History of Science (7); and 
  -- Decisions to found five more institutes are expected in 
fall 1993 or the first half of 1994. 
  It was not until spring 1993, however, that the federal and 
land governments found themselves in a position to bring their 
budget priorities more closely into line with the Max Planck 
Society's institute founding work and to let the society know 
that it could now count on full support for the implementation 
of its long-term program in the new federal laender. Since June 
1993, the Max Planck Society has received enough hints to assume 
that the federal and land governments will provide the funds 
needed to achieve its overall goal, which is for its coverage of 
the new laender to be similar to its presence in the original 
federal area. Since February 1993, the Max Planck Society's 
committees have been continuing the selection and discussion 
process with a view to founding further institutes in the new 
laender, in the expectation that it will be possible to 
implement their decisions. 
  In order to be represented in the new laender by 15 to 20 
institutes by the turn of the century, the Max Planck Society 
hopes to found up to eight more institutes in the new federal 
area over the next few years in addition to those already 
existing and those now being set up or about to emerge from the 
discussion procedure. The Max Planck Society is relying on the 
federal and land governments' promise to provide the requisite 
funds for these plans, which will now assume concrete form, as 
well. 
  In order to meet the target of eight more institutes, the 
scientific members of the society have been asked to submit 
additional proposals for them, if possible by the end of 
November 1993. Spring 1994 will then see the beginning of 
specific discussions on the individual projects in the three 
sections of the Max Planck Society. As set out in box 3, the 
society plans to set up two institutes a year if possible 
between 1995 and 1999 in a continuous succession of planning and 
founding. 
<H3>  Implementation of the Max Planck Society's Program to Set Up 
Research Facilities in the New Federal Laender (1994-200) </H3>
  1. Priority Program 
  1994-1997: funding of teams and local institute 
branches, preparations for institutionalization of 
humanities centers; 
  1998-2000: integration of teams into host universities. 
  2. Long-Term Program 
  1994-2000: implementation of 1992/1993 decisions to 
found institutes, decisions to found projects 
discussed in 1993 and their implementation; discussion, 
founding, and setting up of further MPI's 
<H5>  Difficulties Encountered When Founding Institutes </H5>
  The Max Planck Society has always encountered specific 
difficulties when founding new institutes. Even the planning 
process itself runs a constant risk of foundering on account of 
the particular commitments that have to be entered into on such 
occasions. Moreover, it is the society's political counterparts 
who, by allocating funds or by deciding in favor of other 
priorities, create the conditions in which a project can be 
implemented or otherwise. In addition, our experience over the 
last two years has shown how much more difficult it is to set up 
institutes in the new laender, both because of the many matters 
of science policy and infrastructure planning that remain to be 
settled there, from the structure of higher education down to 
the problems caused by the building land and housing market, and 
because of the specific -- objective and subjective --difficulty 
that leading scientists may encounter in deciding to settle 
permanently with their families in the new federal laender. 
These various factors mean that the possibility of individual 
projects foundering in the new laender can never be ruled out, 
and the number of Max Planck Society commissions appointed to 
examine and draw up proposals for new institutes in 1994 will 
therefore be rather higher than the eight new institutes 
actually contemplated. 
  The committees' work will be arranged in such a way as to 
consider the issue of the choice of location for the projected 
institute as early as possible. The Science Council's 
recommendations as to the development of relevant research areas 
and programs at east German universities will be taken into 
account, as will any of the laender's and universities' plans 
that have now taken a more concrete form; systematic contacts 
with research and structural advisory bodies at the land 
ministries and talks with university colleagues from the 
disciplines concerned will gradually make it clear where 
appropriate conditions for the research work to be performed at 
the planned institute are to be found or may be expected within 
the foreseeable future, and where the institute can make a 
particular contribution to university research. The intention 
is that this procedure will bring the principle of subsidiarity 
to university research to bear in a manner appropriate to the 
specific situation of research in the new laender -- as is 
already the case with the Max Planck Society teams established 
at universities. 
<H5>  Dialogue With the Federal and Land Governments </H5>
  The Max Planck Society is already reporting regularly to the 
Federal-Land Commission on its progress in meeting its planning 
target of up to 20 institutes in the new laender and its 
middle-term financial planning at the annual round of budget 
negotiations. In the summer of 1993, the chairman of the Max 
Planck Society and the Federal Minister of Research and 
Technology also discussed plans for the Max Planck Society and 
the federal and land governments to confer regularly on the 
status reached in the planning of further Max Planck institutes 
and the financial requirements that they entail. An ongoing 
dialogue of this type would also enable the federal and land 
governments to adopt the financial measures required to 
implement the stage reached in the society's planning process at 
an early date. 
  As mentioned above, the Max Planck Society's target is not 
merely to achieve an adequate presence throughout the Federal 
Republic but to distribute the society's research capability 
fairly among the new federal laender. However, this goal of a 
single, coherent research scene cannot be achieved until the 
whole establishment process has been accomplished. On the 
contrary, the individual steps in this process will constantly 
create fresh imbalances, although they will only be temporary, 
and for this reason the Max Planck Society hopes to establish an 
intensive dialogue concerning close, trusting collaboration with 
the new laender themselves so that the intermediate steps can be 
accepted in their inevitable imbalance as a means to the end of 
a generally balanced, albeit not mathematically equal, 
distribution of the Max Planck institutes throughout the new 
federal laender.

<H5>  Final Document </H5>
  Within the framework of a research contract from the Federal 
Ministry of Economics, the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems 
Technology and Innovation Research, Karlsruhe, and the Institute 
for Economic Research, Halle, Berlin Office, organized a hearing 
on 8 and 9 April 1992 in Suhl/Thuringia on the survival problems 
of industrial research establishments in the new laender. More 
than 30 experts from the economic sector, research and politics 
from the entire FRG took part. 
  The participants expressed themselves very openly, with 
criticism and constructiveness, and as complicating conditions 
for restructuring the eastern German research landscape they 
mentioned: 


    -  the slim market for research and development work; 
  -  the great uncertainty about the economic development, which 
could last another five to seven years; 
  -  the barriers to entering the market, which many eastern 
German 
enterprises must overcome against the established 
competition. 

    The participants in the workshop agreed on the following 
recommendations: 
  1. Industrial research must be retained in its core sectors, 
or the process of reindustrialization will be even more delayed. 
Industrial research establishments in the new laender need 
conditions similar to those of the competing institutions in the 
old laender, meaning 


    -  they need buildings, facilities and real estate; 
  -  they must be relieved of old encumbrances and old loans; 
  -  they have claims on equal treatment in the distribution of 
research contracts. 

    2. The governments of the new laender must recognize the 
major importance of applied research for the economic 
development. They should guarantee proportionate basic or 
fundamental financing for efficient R&amp;D, in which activity 
they 
could be guided by the corresponding practice in the old laender. 
  3. It must be guaranteed that eastern German applicants are 
not discriminated against in evaluating project applications. At 
present, western Germans dominate in associations and on expert 
panels. The chances of experts from the new laender to have a 
say should be improved. 
  4. R&amp;D enterprises need a secure financial base in 
order to 
fully utilize their scope for action. To this end the Trust 
Agency should contribute by transferring or conveying property. 
Rapid decisions are necessary, primarily for the so-called 
research companies. 
  5. Support for scientific and technical cooperation with 
Central and Eastern European countries could open up new demand 
for the output of eastern German research institutes. 
  6. The Working Group of Industrial Research Associations 
(AIF) should support activities to found new research 
associations and their acceptance as members. The conditions 
used so far, which are particularly favorable for project 
contracts to R&amp;D establishments in the new laender 
("exemption 
from self-supplied funding"), should be retained until 1995. 
  7. The Trust Agency should to a greater extent supply the 
industrial R&amp;D establishments with guaranteed liquidity 
credits.

  [Text] This paper was generated in connection with the 
study "Industrial Research Establishments in the FRG With 
Special Consideration for Structural Adjustments in the New 
Laender," which was jointly carried out in 1991-93 by the 
Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology and Innovation 
Research (ISI), Karlsruhe, and the Institute for Economic 
Research Halle (IWH), Berlin, at the request of the Federal 
Ministry for Economics. The project leaders at ISI were Stefan 
Kuhlmann, Rainer Bierhals, Doris Holland, Guido Reger. Project

<H3>  The Double Challenge: Upheaval in Germany's Industrial 
Research Infrastructure--Requirements for Political Action </H3>
<H5>  1. Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure </H5>
  Industrial research is an important element for a 
competitive, modern industry; it combines knowledge of basic 
research with the requirements of industrial production. 
Industrial research is therefore an essential part of the 
technological innovation capability in the economy. 
  The industrial research infrastructure in the united Germany 
today faces a double challenge: 
  Challenge 1: Industrial research needs a technical and 
functional adjustment to the altered tasks; this is a result of 
the progressive technological development and altered dynamic of 
the world market, which further reinforce the pressure for 
innovation in industry. First, new subject concentrations are 
emerging in research and technology, to which the industrial 
research establishments and government R&amp;D funding measures 
must 
react. Second, it is becoming clear that industrial research 
institutions today, more than before, must be understood as 
active intermediaries in networks of various industrial partners 
and research establishments, and that in so doing basic research 
and application development must cooperate more closely than 
before--in local as well as globalized industrial connections. 
  Challenge 2: Simultaneously, an internal German adjustment 
of 
capacity and structure is necessary. As a result of the change 
in systems, industrial research in the new laender has lost its 
customers almost completely and is in total upheaval, and 
largely in dissolution as well. The sharp economic decline of 
the global economy, which now has also reached western German 
industry, further led to reduced utilization of western German 
industrial research as well. Despite the already completed 
downsizing in eastern Germany, the declining demand is today 
faced with a relatively large overall German supply potential 
for industrial research that lacks industrial contracts. To this 
is added a structural problem: Both research systems contributed 
similar strengths and weaknesses; today a heated, cutthroat 
competition is under way, in which eastern German suppliers are 
clearly finding poorer starting conditions. 
  In order to assure an overall German industrial landscape 
that is aimed at the future, is innovation-oriented and benefits 
industrial competitiveness, two urgent tasks must be mastered at 
the same time: 


    -  In the short term: The creation of improved competitive 
conditions for the remaining industrial research establishments 
in eastern Germany--assuming that an approximately equal 
distribution between old and new laender is politically intended. 
  -  In the medium term: A stocktaking, specific adjustment and 
further development of the entire German industrial research 
landscape. 

    The following part of the research report called "Industrial 
Research Establishments in the FRG With Special Consideration of 
Structural Adjustments in the New Laender" is meant as a 
contribution to the discussion of requirements for political 
action in this field. In the following the outlined discussions 
will be shown as having several steps. 
  The argumentation rests on results of the studies, carried 
out jointly by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology 
and Innovation Research (ISI) and the Institute for Economic 
Research Halle (IWH) in 1991/92 on this subject, which are 
documented in the other sections of the research report, and on 
assessments of newer results of innovation research. 
<H3>  2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New 
Political Efforts </H3>
  A debate on the future of industrial research in Germany 
must 
take the following aspects into account: 


    -  Support for research and technology is a long-term 
investment and does not help overcome the current economic 
crisis. 
  -  New technological concentrations and the increasing 
interlinking of technologies will mark industrial research 
services in the future. 
  -  New functions of technical research and industrial innovation 
are developing. 
  -  Regions need a mix of industrial research at the "middle" 
level 
of technology and a "wide range." 
  -  Industrial research in eastern Germany needs preferential 
treatment in order to have a chance to adjust to the double 
structural change. 
  -  A stocktaking and specific restructuring of the 
entire German industrial research landscape is 
necessary. 

    These aspects can only be briefly commented on in the 
following. A systematic analysis and the design of future 
structures for industrial research in Germany will require 
significantly greater efforts than were possible within the 
framework of this underlying study. 
<H3>  Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term 
Investment and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis </H3>
  The discussions outlined here for the support of research 
and 
technology are not suitable for helping to overcome the double 
crisis of the German economy in the early 1990s, which consists 
of the basic adjustment crisis of eastern German industry and 
the current economic slump in the western German economy. 
  Strengthening the technological innovation capability of 
industry is a permanent task, whose results become effective 
only in the medium and long term. Planning horizons for 
stabilization, reorganization and expansion of the industrial 
research infrastructure must therefore have a perspective of at 
least five to ten years. The buildup of the existing 
infrastructure in the old laender took place over three decades 
before it reached its present size, and the establishments were 
able to assume their present functions in the scientific and 
industrial innovation system. 
  For the infrastructure plans for industrial research in the 
area of the new laender today this means--after an urgent, 
initial guarantee of a minimum potential in the upheaval phase 
of 1989/72, as was shown by the fate of many "research 
companies"--that the foreseeable requirements must be the 
determining ones at the end of our decade and in transition to 
the next millennium. These requirements cannot be exactly 
specified in advance, however, partly because the positions of 
the German economy in the world market in five years and later 
are uncertain, and partly because technological developments 
cannot be adequately assessed. However, we can indicate a few 
elements in the foreseeable shifts in concentration and altered 
function of industrial research in the coming years. 
<H3>  New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing 
Interlinking </H3>
  In the last few years the question of the potential 
development of science and technology is again being discussed 
and studied in leading industrial nations, above all in the 
United States and in Japan, as well as in Europe and in other 
OECD nations. A whole series of studies on evaluating the 
so-called critical technology fields for the medium-term future 
have now been published. They contain more or less extensive 
lists of technologies (for example the Commerce Department of 
the United States: "Emerging Technology: An Appraisal of the 
Technical and Economic Possibilities," 1990; "Report of the 
National Committee for Critical Technology" of the United 
States, 1991; Ministry of Economics of the Netherlands: 
"Experiment in Technology Forecasting," 1991; Economic Planning 
Agency, Japan: "Technology and Products in the Year 2010," 1992; 
Science and Technology Agency, Japan: "Future Technology in 
Japan," 1992). Such studies were produced with the general 
objective of being able to concentrate research activities and 
government followup measures to those areas of technology, where 
a decisive influence on the future problem-solving capability of 
the national economies in question is addressed. Such studies 
are also under way in Germany at this time (one with medium-term 
and one with long-term perspectives), which have not yet been 
concluded, however. 
  What information regarding the innovation process from 
medium 
and long-term perspectives, and thus for the tasks of industrial 
research, can be obtained from such studies, and what 
bottlenecks can be perceived? This is, of course a prognostic 
and synthetic question, to which there is no ultimate answer, 
founded on data. 
  In general terms, the innovation cycle can be sketched as 
that of "intelligent" technology. The universally cheap resource 
of petroleum in the postwar era is replaced by the universally 
cheap resource of the "chip." 
  In the discussion of bottlenecks, greater attention must be 
paid to the demand factors. Technology monitoring (and sometimes 
also technology policy) is tempted to limit itself to the 
description and consideration of the potential supply of natural 
science technology solutions and the institutions which offer 
them. Which technology and which research infrastructure will be 
important in the future depends to a great extent on the 
anticipated social, ecological and economic problem pressure, 
from which important demands on the science and technology of 
the future are formulated. 
  For the purpose of clear arrangement and description, it is 
possible to distinguish those fields of technology, which in all 
corresponding foreign studies are regarded as essential for the 
future innovation capability (a new assessment by the ISI and 
the project sponsor, the Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology [BMFT], undertaken at the request of the BMFT, will 
soon appear): 


    -  Advanced materials, 
  -  manufacturing and production technologies, 
  -  information technology and electronics, 
  -  biotechnology, 
  -  and, above all, technologies in their respective overlapping 
areas, such as microsystem technology, nanotechnology, molecular 
electronics. 

    Technology at the beginning of the 21st Century cannot be 
divided according to conventional aspects, however; this applies 
particularly to application areas. Applications such as future 
telecommunications result from progress in both microelectronics 
and photonics and are not conceivable without contributions from 
software development. This cooperation by technologies is not 
basically new, but is spreading more and more and now requires 
consequences for the research, technology and innovation 
policies. It must be studied whether the research infrastructure 
(including the industrial one) and the existing research 
administration in Germany must be adapted to the objectively 
existing interlinking. 
<H3>  New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial 
Innovation Develop </H3>
  The OECD recently stressed (as a result of its 
"Technology/Economy Program") the altered role of industrial 
research in the industrialized nations: As an "intermediary 
body," it will in the future not only provide the transfer of 
knowledge from research to industrial application, but must also 
feed back the requirements of industry to basic and 
long-term-oriented research. Beyond that, it will have to meet 
the--seemingly paradoxical--double challenge of being 
increasingly active "on the spot" in local technology-oriented 
networks as well as cooperate in "globalized" technology 
development contexts ("techno-globalism"), since the production 
of knowledge and innovations more and more frequently takes 
place in international connections. 
  This is the result of a structural change for technological 
innovations, which now no longer takes place in "new" technology 
fields (such as modern biotechnology), but on a broad front, and 
to which the industrial and industrially applied research in the 
new laender must also submit (see also Box 1). Michael Gibbons 
of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) spectacularly called 
this supplementation, observed by many innovation researchers, 
of the innovation process by a second mode the "transition from 
mode 1 to mode 2 of the knowledge production:" Mode 1 describes 
a more traditional, "linear," discipline-bound, primarily 
internal (within a company or research institute) manner of 
producing technological innovation through "applied" research 
and development (which in certain fields will continue to be of 
importance); mode 2 describes a new form of science-based 
innovation processes, which overcomes the conventional 
separation of pure and applied research. Elements of the new 
form of science production are: 


    -  Research in connection with application and application 
development with feedback to the research base, 
  -  production of "transdisciplinary" knowledge, 
  -  heterogeneous form of activities and participating actors, 
  -  variety of organizational and institutional forms, 
  -  immediate industrial utilization of the possibilities of new 
technical facilities and equipment in research, 
  -  greater demands for quality and efficiency control. 

    To begin with, these are very general conclusions, which 
need 
more precise analysis and specification for individual fields of 
technology, research institutions and various industries. It is 
certain, however, that a view, organization and promotion of 
industrial research that is largely oriented toward traditional 
divisions of industrial branches, such as dominates traditional 
"joint industrial research," will no longer do justice to the 
interconnected character and "transdisciplinary quality" of 
increasingly science-linked innovation processes. 
<H3>  Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial 
Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary. </H3>
  In a market for industrial research in Germany, which is 
overcrowded in some fields and which furthermore is marked by a 
decrease in research contracts from the economy and restrained 
government support for industrial research, it is particularly 
difficult for these establishments and enterprises in the new 
laender to become permanently established: In view of the 
extremely unfavorable starting conditions (interrupted relations 
with former industrial partners, the lack of capital, uncertain 
property conditions, obsolete facilities, the danger of losing 
qualified personnel) they regard themselves as exposed to a 
fierce, cutthroat competition, although in part they are highly 
efficient and willing to achieve. 
  A future-oriented market strategy includes market analyses 
and operating systems, sufficient investments and long-term 
business strategies, particularly innovation and technology 
strategies. It is precisely in these areas that eastern German 
enterprises have major shortcomings. Short-term survival 
strategies (such as low-price policies) do not create any 
prospects. What is decisive is the correct positioning of one's 
own work with respect to the demands of technological 
innovations in industry--right now these are undergoing a 
radical process of change: World-market-capable products from a 
high-price economy such as the German (and other western 
European ones) will be even more technology-intensive in the 
future than in the past. The "technological intensity" of the 
products today increasingly also includes intelligent 
interconnection of technologies of very different origin; at the 
same time, more and more often knowledge from basic scientific 
research flows directly into the development process for new 
products (or methods). 
  The growing "interlinking of technology" and 
"science-basing" 
creates new challenges for industrial research and development; 
small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, thus end up under 
pressure to adjust and are looking for support. Industrial 
research establishments can provide help here and thus find a 
market, if they meet the following demands: 


    -  Technological interconnection. Intelligent 
products require the combination of the most varied 
technologies; industrial research must visibly be able to 
practice interface management. 
  -  Interdisciplinary cooperation. More than before, 
representatives of various disciplines in the engineering 
sciences, the natural sciences and technology management must be 
ready for and capable of cooperating. 
  -  Network orientation. One enterprise is increasingly 
less able to offer all the know-how about technology-intensive 
products: Formal and informal cooperation between various 
partners (companies, research facilities, engineering bureaus, 
etc.) in technology networks becomes more important. 
  -  Simultaneous regional and global orientation. 
Industry-related research needs strong roots in the regional 
research and industrial environment, but in the respective field 
of expertise it must maintain active connections with leading 
worldwide developments, for instance through international 
research cooperations. 

<H3>    Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle' 
Level of Technology and a `Wide Range.' </H3>
  The conclusions in the preceding step do not make regional 
potentials in industrial research at the "middle" technological 
level, which are frequently based more on the traditional, 
"linear," model, superfluous. Practical experience proves--and 
many innovation and regional research studies confirm--that they 
continue to form a stabilizing element in modern industrial 
structures, whose backbone are active, company-internal R&amp;D 
potentials. 
  In the old laender such capacities have been built up over 
decades with massive use of public funding from the Federal 
Government and the laender; many of these research 
establishments today form the foundation for continued 
development toward "science-based" technological innovations. 
  Which "mix" of industrial research establishments from 
various fields of technology and with varying technological 
"range" is regionally or nationally necessary? It would take a 
great deal of expense systematically to compare, quantitatively 
and qualitatively, the existing infrastructure of industrial 
research in the old laender with the establishments in existence 
right now in eastern Germany, in order to draw conclusions for 
planning decisions; this expense could not be justified in the 
framework of the analyses undertaken for this report. 
  But just a glance at the industrial research infrastructure 
"mix" of an old land, which is very active in this respect, 
makes it clear how large the gap is that yawns between the 
situation there and the conditions in the new laender (see Box 
2). The desire to build such an infrastructure from scratch in 
each of the eastern German laender would take an extraordinary 
effort. 
<H3>  Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example: 
Baden-Wuerttemberg </H3>
  The beginnings of government support for industrial research 
in the region of the Land of Baden-Wuerttemberg go back far into 
the 19th Century. Today, the land (9.6 million inhabitants) 
counts the following among its industrial research 
establishments: 


    -  13 Fraunhofer Society institutes, 
  -  10 joint industrial research institutes, 
  -  Eight contract research facilities at universities, 
  -  Two large research establishments, 
  -  about 100 transfer establishments of the Steinbeis Foundation 
(usually) at technical colleges. 

    These facilities are financed by research income (contract 
research, research funding) and by institutional funding from 
the Federal Government and the land (in proportions varying 
according to the institution). 
  The Fraunhofer Society institutes in Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(1,500 employees) work in the following fields of work, among 
others: Information technology, production automation, biomethod 
technology, energy technology, construction technology, sensor 
technology, materials. The budget of the Baden-Wuerttemberg 
institutes was DM 300 million in 1989, approximately one-third 
of which was financed on the basis of industrial cooperations. 
  Divided by industry, the joint industrial research 
establishments operate in the following fields: textile and 
process technology, clothing industry, textile chemistry, 
chemical fibers, tanning, pigments/paints, industrial glass, 
precision mechanics/watch technology, microtechnology, fine 
metals/metal chemistry, synthetics. The budget volume for these 
establishments was DM 46 million in 1989, DM 14 million of which 
were based on industrial cooperations. 
  The contract research institutes at the universities ("An 
institutes"), which have only been around for a few years in 
this form, are active in the following sectors: 
microelectronics, information science, natural sciences-medical 
research, laser technology in medicine, application-oriented 
knowledge processing, solar energy and hydrogen research, 
manufacturing technology. In 1989 the budget for these 
institutes was DM 49 million, DM 18 million of which came from 
cooperations with the business sector. 
  The large research establishments (Stuttgart Research Center 
of the Aerospace Research Institute, DLR, in the fields of 
materials, construction methods, energetics, and Karlsruhe 
Nuclear Research Center, KfK, in the fields of environmental 
technology, materials research, handling technology, microsystem 
technology, nuclear technology), earned about DM 30 million in 
income in 1989 through industrial cooperations (with a total 
budget of DM 780 million). In connection with the shrinking 
institutional support for these establishments from the federal 
government, they will make efforts over the next few years to 
expand their share of the contract research market. 
  The technical advisory services and transfer centers of the 
Steinbeis Foundation (founded in 1971), in the which professors 
and graduates from technical colleges in the region offer 
technological advice and development projects in the fields of 
flexible automation and production technology, process 
technology, electronics/microelectronics, software engineering 
and CAD/CAM, in 1989 earned more than 90 percent of their DM 65 
million budget from industrial cooperations. 
<H3>  Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential 
Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double 
Structural Change </H3>
  The collapse of industrial research in the new laender has 
already taken on dramatic proportions. Of the approximately 
75,000 researchers active in industry at the beginning of 1990, 
at the present time--as reported by representative surveys at 
the beginning of October 1992--no more than 15,000 are left in 
the new laender. The number of industrial researchers in the new 
laender, compared to the old laender, has thus reached a ratio 
of 1:15. While in the old laender there are seven researchers 
for every 100 industry employees, in the new laender there is 
only one. In addition, it must be taken into account that of the 
remaining R&amp;D employees one in three works in a job creation 
position. 
  So far, it has not been possible to halt the decline of 
R&amp;D 
potentials. An extensive inquiry among privatized research 
establishments and privatized enterprises gave the result that, 
from the end of 1991 until April 1992, a 25 percent decrease in 
R&amp;D potential took place, and these companies feared an 
additional decrease by mid-1993 by up to 60 percent. In Trust 
Agency enterprises, as well, a more rapid drop in R&amp;D 
employees 
than in general employees is taking place, as confirmed by 
reports from the Trust Agency itself. 
  About half of all industrial R&amp;D employees in the new 
laender 
are still working in Trust Agency enterprises. Although the 
Trust Agency is trying to enforce preservation of the R&amp;D 
potential when selling the companies, increasingly more buyers 
of industrial enterprises are refusing to take over R&amp;D 
employees. The number of enterprises which function as "extended 
workbenches" for their mother companies, is growing. 
  The present development in industrial research runs counter 
to the desirable industrial buildup in the new laender. Where 
there is a lack of creative research there is also a lack of 
innovation, and where no innovations are being brought out there 
will also be little investment. Successful innovations presume 
immaterial investments and result in material replacement, 
rationalization, and expansion investments. For that reason 
R&amp;D 
must not be regarded as a labor policy task, but as a necessary 
investment for the future. 
  Although basically an original task for the economy, the 
federal government and the laender agree that in view of the 
extent and the special problems of structural change in the 
economy in the new laender, the process of restructuring and 
reorganization and expansion of efficient R&amp;D potentials 
must be 
accompanied by subsidies over a longer period through government 
measures. In this sense many attempts at economic and technology 
policy are being made to promote the innovation capability of 
eastern German enterprises. The BMWi [Federal Ministry for 
Economics] and the BMFT are making a large amount of funding 
available. But it is still not clear whether these subsidies 
will also be available in the medium term (three to five years) 
as a prerequisite for self-supporting reconstruction in the new 
laender. 
  In the future it will primarily be the laender which must 
bear special responsibility in this process. A glance at the 
abundance of existing subsidy measures being offered by the 
governments in the old laender (see Box 3) makes it clear how 
much eastern Germany still needs to catch up, although the 
governments in the new laender are apparently becoming active in 
this field, as was documented at another place in this study. 
  A research landscape is soon destroyed. Rebuilding it is 
many 
times more expensive than keeping it. For this reason it is 
proposed 


    -  that research potentials be supported on site for a 
longer, but defined period of time. The research establishments 
need fundamental or basic financing (decreasing), since only a 
minor part of the overall costs can be financed from project 
support; 
  -  that a gradually decreasing financial subsidy be assumed for 
the next three to five years for the enterprises still under 
Trust Agency management. Limiting the subsidy to enterprises 
with fewer than 1,000 employees is here counterproductive for 
maintaining the R&amp;D potentials. 
  -  that the subsidy rate in certain cases be increased to 80 
percent for enterprises, which due to their limited financial 
opportunities cannot generate the required 50 percent of their 
own funding and for that reason cannot claim any subsidies; 
  -  that equal starting conditions be created for eastern German 
industrial, independent, research establishments by conveying 
ownership of the movable goods as well as property needed for 
the business. In addition, cancellation of old debts and 
liquidation loans is indispensable. 
  -  that the support of contract research from west to east (AWO) 
be expanded. Utilization of eastern German industrial research 
by companies in the processing industries in the old laender has 
been less than satisfactory until now. With exactly DM 50 
million (as of August 1992), one can only speak of a beginning 
of support in awarding contracts to researchers in the new 
laender. Measured by the annual amounts given away by 
enterprises in the old laender to external research 
establishments, the above amount, at not quite one percent, is 
very low; 
  -  that the equality of eastern German R&amp;D facilities in 
competing 
for the granting of contracts be assured. To that end, more 
eastern German scientists should also sit on expert panels.

<H3>    Stocktaking and Specific Restructuring of the Entire German 
Industrial Research Landscape </H3>
  In the old FRG a relatively differentiated system of 
industrial research had developed since the 1960s; important 
elements are the institutes for joint industrial research, the 
Fraunhofer Society institutes, the universities, the technical 
colleges and increasingly the major research establishments. In 
the former GDR industrial research was organized completely 
differently, but it also had--something which is crucial 
here--comparatively high-quality research resources, above all 
in human capital. 
  Today, more than two years after the German unification, the 
all-German industrial research is facing a challenge with 
respect to volume: The uncontrolled decline of industrial 
production in the new laender is accompanied by a continued 
cutback in industrial research in eastern Germany. The sharp 
economic slump in the global economy, which has now reached the 
western German industry as well, also causes a shrinking demand 
for the services of western Germany industrial research. 
  To this is added a structural problem: A comparison of 
technological specialization models in eastern and western 
Germany for the year immediately before the unification shows 
that both research systems demonstrate similar strengths and 
weaknesses, so that there were scarcely any positive 
complementary effects. On the contrary; a violent cutthroat 
competition began, in which eastern German workers clearly had 
the inferior starting conditions. 
  What could have happened even at the time of the German 
unification must take place now: The entire German industrial 
research infrastructure should be subjected to a thorough 
stocktaking 


    -  on the demand side, meaning with a view to the 
foreseeable (as well as desirable with respect to industrial 
policy) industrial demand for research work, 
  -  on the supply side, meaning with a view to existing and 
development-capable potentials, 
  -  institutionally, meaning with a view to proven or obsolete 
financing, organization and cooperation models, 
respectively. 

    Since this has already in part been done as regards the 
eastern German infrastructure, this challenge applies 
particularly to the western German system. It should be 
connected with the attempt to describe the entire German market 
for research and development services in terms of quantity as 
well (see Box 4). 
  Several reasons argue in favor of such a revision: 


    -  Until now there has been no sufficiently detailed, in 
terms of quantity and quality, and at the same time clear 
picture of the entire German infrastructure of industrial 
research, but such an overview represents an indispensable 
foundation for planning and decisions in research and innovation 
policy. 
  -  There are accumulating indications that the spending for 
research and technology development in Germany is stagnating or 
even declining. The public research budgets have grown 
disproportionately with the German unification, that is to say, 
in relative terms they have shrunk. Research spending by the 
economic sector hardly grew in real terms in the last three 
years--after high growth rates in the 1980s--and the number of 
employed research personnel in the old laender from 1989 to 1991 
dropped by 2.9 percent a year (according to the Expert Report on 
Economic Statistics 1992). Under these conditions there is also 
a stagnation of external R&amp;D spending by enterprises--and 
hence 
the field of action for industrial research. 
  -  The system of government actors is fragmented; there is a 
lack 
of coordination between department politics and of a clear 
division of duties between regional, national and European 
R&amp;D 
policies. 
  -  There are scarcely any long-term and strategically designed 
guidelines, either in industry or in research and technology 
policy. 
  -  The mobility between the subsystems of the research system 
(for 
example between industrial research, economic research, academic 
operation) and in international connections is insufficient. 
  -  The politically offered incentive systems are now no longer 
sufficiently capable of adjustment or creative; it is felt that 
their concepts are no longer specific enough. 

    In the event the proposed extensive stocktaking of the 
business-oriented research system should finally lead to a 
reorganization, several factors are unavoidable: 


    -  A restructuring of industrial research must take place 
with a view to the position and opportunities of German industry 
in the world market. In so doing, one must balance which 
weaknesses in the technological performance profile can 
realistically be overcome by the industry and by government 
support for industrial research, and which market sectors will 
remain unconquerable. 
  -  The existing industrial structures and industrial 
concentrations in eastern and western Germany, insofar as they 
are competitive or harbor strong potential for future success, 
must be treated as constants in the decision about research 
infrastructures. 
  -  The restructuring must treat German industrial research as a 
part of the larger infrastructure of the European Community and 
also with a view to Central and Eastern Europe. 

    It is of basic importance here that the state cannot 
"execute" this restructuring process but should primarily 
moderate and, during recognizable bottlenecks, provide support 
through institutional funding for necessary research facilities 
and time-limited subsidy programs. 
<H3>  Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and 
Development in the Old Laender </H3>
  An exact description of the market for R&amp;D services 
creates 
difficulties in several respects, which are mentioned elsewhere 
(see PROGNOS/ISI: "R&amp;D Cooperations by Small and Medium-Sized 
Enterprises, Basel/Karlsruhe, 1991). Including the new laender 
makes little sense, since the corresponding data are still 
incomplete and the dynamic of negative change continues to be 
strong (See Expert Report on Economic Statistics: "Research and 
Development in the Economy, Results and Assessments 1991-92"). 
  The data available for the old laender show stagnation, 
after 
impressive growth in research spending in the economy in the 
1980s and an absolutely and relatively significant growth in 
external research tasks since the beginning of the 1990s. This 
is undoubtedly a reflection of the slowdown in economic growth. 
Experience in innovation research ("interlocking technologies," 
"science-linking") allows for the assumption, however, that the 
proportion of external R&amp;D spending (about 10 percent) 
reached 
today will no longer decrease but perhaps might even grow. 
  More precise analyses here show that the predominant part of 
external company spending flows not to government-supported 
research infrastructures but to other companies--a clear 
indication of the interconnection of industrial technology! As 
is well known, the entry into the R&amp;D market is made easier 
for 
government-supported institutions through programs which offer 
financial support for cooperation between industry and science. 
  Under these framework conditions it cannot be anticipated 
that eastern German establishments should rapidly be able to 
capture, on their own, an appreciable share of the all-German 
R&amp;D market.

<F P=106> [Article: "Strengthening of Franco-Israeli Scientific </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem--France's minister for 
higher education and research, Mr. Francois Fillon, was in 
Israel 22-25 November to strengthen scientific and technical 
cooperation between the two countries. The trip also gave him 
the opportunity to make contact with Palestinian personalities 
and look at ways to increase aid in these fields to the 
populations of Gaza and Jericho. 
  Cooperation between the two countries was reviewed on 23 
November, in Jerusalem, at the second meeting of the 
Franco-Israeli High Scientific Council, with Mr. Fillon and Mrs. 
Shulamit Aloni, the Israeli research minister, in attendance. 
Created in 1987, this body previously had met only once, in 1989. 
  "We want to participate in the building of peace in the 
Middle East," Mr. Fillon said at a press conference following 
the meeting. "We must take political progress into account and 
thus to consider cooperation in different modalities. There is 
every reason now to put obstacles of the past behind us. We are 
ready to participate in development of the (occupied) 
territories, in projects desired by the Palestinians. In our 
view, scientific and technical cooperation is indeed the 
foundation of peace and development." It can "efface differences 
in economic levels, reduce tension, and thus facilitate peace." 
  French and Israeli representatives agreed at the meeting to 
launch two new high-priority programs, in immunology and in 
basic research on composite materials; each project will be 
allotted a half-million dollars per year for a two-year period. 
Allocation of such large sums "demonstrates the commitment of 
our two governments to continue with the science and technology 
cooperation" which began many years ago and will now, according 
to Mr. Fillon, be "redoubled again." Both sides noted the 
"exemplary character and high quality" of Franco-Israeli 
cooperation. 
  The two new programs will be launched in the next few 
months. 
They were proposed by the scientists themselves because of their 
innovative character, the excellent scientific potential of the 
two countries in these domains, and lastly because, as the 
French minister put it, collaborative efforts by researchers 
from the two scientific communities in these fields "are very 
likely to yield positive results." Also discussed was the 
possibility of broadening the already good bilateral cooperation 
on health problems to include other Mediterranean basin 
countries. An initial meeting on the subject may be held next 
year. 
  On 24 November Mr. Fillon traveled to the Palestinian 
University of Bir-Zeit (about twenty kilometers from Jerusalem), 
which was closed by Israeli authorities from 1988 to 1992 
because of the "Intifada" ("war of stones"). The visit of the 
French minister for higher education and research coincided, by 
chance, with the holding of Bir-Zeit's first student council 
elections. The president of that large university group, Mr. 
Hanna Nassir--a member of the Palestinian High Council, he was 
allowed to return to Bir-Zeit only last April--said he was 
delighted to have Mr. Fillon visit the campus "at such a 
decisive moment" for the "national development" of the 
Palestinian people. 
  "We know we can count on France, which has taught the world 
the true meaning of the word liberty," to furnish aid to the 
eight Palestinian universities, which have a combined enrollment 
of 20,000 students and a budget in the neighborhood of US$26 
million. "France has always supported your right to control your 
own destiny," said Fillon. "We will continue to support that 
goal. I am here to tell you that the French Government is ready 
to cooperate with your universities, so that the system you have 
already begun building, under difficult circumstances, will be 
able to take on new dimensions." 
  "We are ready to support the Bir-Zeit juridical [education] 
center, the creation of a master's program in public 
administration, the training of administrative support 
personnel, the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian degree 
course--with instruction in the French language, of course--the 
expansion of education in technical fields, and to cooperate in 
research programs that correspond to your needs." And to engage 
in academic exchange programs. "As I see it," the minister 
added, "scientific and technological cooperation is a decisive 
factor for the establishment of a durable peace throughout the 
region." 
  During his visit to Israel, Mr. Fillon also held talks with 
Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein and Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres. 
<H5>  30-Year Cooperation </H5>
  Franco-Israeli cooperation in science, technology, higher 
education, and cultural affairs dates back more than 30 years. 
Launched in 1959 by a governmental cooperation accord, it has 
been in existence ever since, albeit subject to the vicissitudes 
of politics and the complexities entailed by the risk of 
knowledge transfer to a country that has very high scientific 
potential. Israel treats research as a "national priority" and 
in fact devotes to it three percent of gross domestic product 
[GDP], compared to 2.4 percent for France. 
  Scientific and technological cooperation is effected both 
through the Franco-Israeli Association for Scientific and 
Technological Research (AFIRST) and under the rubric of direct 
accords between French research bodies (CNRS [National 
Scientific Research Center], INSERM [National Institute of 
Health and Medical Research], INRA [National Institute of 
Agronomic Research], INRIA [National Institute for Research on 
Data Processing and Automation], the Pasteur Institute) and 
their Israeli counterparts (Weizmann Institute, Technion, 
Volcani Institute, etc.) or Israel's National Council for 
Research and Development (CNRD). 
  The commitment to strengthen cooperation was underlined by 
both sides during President Mitterrand's official visit to 
Israel in November 1992 and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin's visit to Paris 
last June. Since then, concurrently with the High Scientific 
Council, a High Council on Research and Industry was 
established; still under discussion is the proposed creation of 
a $250 million Binational Fund to finance basic research 
projects and the creation of industrial partnerships. 
  Frenchmen and Israelis are cooperating in such varied fields 
as life sciences, mathematics, composite materials, immunology, 
virology, biology, botanical biotechnologies, research on arid 
and desert zones, and hydrobiology. Despite the existence of 29 
inter-university accords, exchange students are few--only 223 
Israelis, 50 percent of them in the humanities, are studying in 
France--because of the drawing power of American universities. 
  Despite the existence of a French-speaking community of 
about 
500,000 persons, the French language is clearly on the decline 
in Israel, both because it enjoys no official status in the 
education system (whereas English and Arabic are mandatory), and 
because since 1962 Hebrew has been among the 14 living languages 
in which applicants may take the French university entrance 
examination.

<F P=106> [Article: "Nonlinear Institute of Nice (INLN) Launched at </F>
Sophia-Antipolis"] 
  [Text] Sophia-Antipolis--The Nonlinear Institute of Nice 
(INLN), a joint research unit of CNRS [National Scientific 
Research Center] and the University of Nice, officially 
inaugurated its new Sophia-Antipolis facility on 22 November. 
  Created in January 1991, the institute headed by Gerard 
Iooss, a professor at the University of Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, 
was housed until now at the University of Nice. In attendance 
for the inauguration were CNRS director general Francois 
Kourilsky, Nice University president Michel Bornancin, Mr. 
Pierre Laffitte, a senator and president of "High Technology 
Road" (an association of provincial technology centers), and a 
number of mathematicians, physicists, and chemists including 
Ilya Prigogine (Nobel Prize for chemistry, 1977). The ceremony 
afforded Mr. Daniel Thoulouze, head of CNRS's Department of 
Physical and Mathematical Sciences, the opportunity to present 
the Center's 1993 Silver Medal to Pierre Coullet, head of the 
INLN research group studying "instability and chaos". 
  The staff of INLN, whose founders include Gerard Iooss and 
Pierre Coullet, consists now of 31 scientists and academics in 
diverse disciplines--mathematics, theoretical physics, 
experimental physics, engineering, etc.--26 graduate students, 
and 12 "visitors." It seems destined for further growth: 
Although Nice-based nonlinear phenomena researchers have 
succeeded in creating a real school, a number of similar 
laboratories have long been in existence in the United States. 
According to one expert in this domain, Albert Libchaber 
(Princeton University and NEC laboratory), "Europe is far behind 
the United States in this field." 
  INLN is divided into six groups--"instability and chaos," 
"theory of branch-points and applications," "theory of (quantal) 
fields and applications," "topological and differentiable 
dynamics," "stability and boundary control of continuous media," 
and "experimental nonlinear dynamics"--composed of 
mathematicians and physicists as well as researchers in optics, 
meteorology, and biology. Currently staying as a guest at the 
institute is Russian scientist Professor Valentine Krinsky, 
whose work focuses particularly on chaotic phenomena in 
cardiology and who might remain at INLN. 
  With this new installation, CNRS strengthens its 
infrastructural base in Sophia-Antipolis, now the site of three 
of its own laboratories, two joint laboratories, and seven 
affiliated laboratories, in addition to the 
Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur [PACA] regional delegation's branch 
office for Alpes-Maritimes. 
<H5>  Nonlinear Meteorology </H5>
  In meteorology, a field marked by chaotic phenomena, 
research 
into nonlinear phenomena can help improve forecasting. For 
decades now, according to Guy Plaut, INLN's only meteorologist, 
autumns in Provence have been either unusually dry or punctuated 
by repeated "deluges." This year, between 13 September and 10 
October, downpours were truly torrential: 90mm of water on 13 
September, 50 on 23 September, 40 on 1 October. 
  Once a "cycle" of drought or very high rainfall is 
established, it tends to last a long time. There is no way yet 
to make predictions in this kind of situation, but by 
correlating precipitation readings with measurements of 
barometric pressure (at sea level and high in the atmosphere) in 
the North Atlantic, it should be possible to identify the 
critical determinants for these rains and make probabilistic 
forecasts. Doing so will require data--40 years' worth--at both 
global (hemispheric) and local levels--from the National 
Meteorological Center of Boulder (Colorado) as well as Nice's 
Meteo-France weather station, for example. 
  In future, says Plaut, it should be possible to predict by 
late August the likelihood of these autumn "deluges." In 
general, it should be possible to make probabilistic predictions 
for any such changes of broad weather pattern. 
  The study of nonlinear phenomena can also help predict 
consequences of the greenhouse effect. "We must not think about 
the greenhouse effect in linear terms," says Plaut: It could 
push climatological variables into a "sensitive" or chaotic zone 
that might lead either to warming or to cooling. "Paradoxically, 
a warming trend could in theory lead to a cooling effect."

<F P=106> [Article by Lothar Spaeth: "Ways of Getting Out of the </F>
Innovation Crisis"] 
  [Text] Germany's status in technology 
is in jeopardy. Dr. Lothar Spaeth, managing director of 
Jenoptik, believes that nothing less than a major thrust in 
innovative developments can save Germany's traditional leading 
industrial position. Spaeth, the former minister president of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg proposes a new technology policy. 
  When, in the face of the current recession, we ask ourselves 
if Germany industry had taken advantage of the "fat" years of 
the 1980s to improve its competitiveness, the answer must be a 
resounding "no." The structural deficits revealed by the 
downward economic trend attest that in recent years we have been 
living too much off past achievements while neglecting 
innovation. 
  If we continue to rely on older products, whose net product 
has stagnated and whose markets have shrunk, we shall not be 
able to achieve sufficient growth in the future to ensure full 
employment in the western part of our country or to build up 
employment in the eastern sector. This trend can only be 
confronted by a qualitative leap forward. Neither marginal 
improvements nor quantitative growth can reverse the trend. 
Germany absolutely needs an innovative thrust to capture the 
expanding world markets with new, high-quality products, 
processes, and problem solutions. 
  In this report I have listed what prerequisites I believe 
Germany needs to undertake such a new beginning. I also point 
out the dangers and pitfalls that lay ahead and the measures 
that must be taken now to create a secure, promising economic 
future in Germany and in Europe generally. 
  Obsolescence. German technology is becoming 
increasing obsolescent. This becomes immediately evident when we 
compare our technology products with those of our competitors. 
The so-called RCA-Values (Revealed Comparative Advantage), which 
indicate the degree of industrial goods specialization in 
foreign trade, shows this clearly. 
  To be sure, Germany remains, as before, a leading exporter 
of 
some advanced technology. However, really top technological 
products only appear in the export figures on a below average 
level. 
  The danger therefore exists that in a few years the 
technologies, which are still considered advanced today (e.g., 
in the automobile and machine tool sectors), with their 
so-called "mature" products and processes, will no longer be 
profitable in Germany. Of course, our economy will still need 
such "cash cows" to ensure high income and employment figures in 
the future. 
  Nonetheless, it is obvious that, owing to the deficits in 
"birthing" new technologies, an insufficiency will develop in 
income- and employment-intensive products in the advanced 
categories. The top technologies of today, considered "problem 
children" because of their characteristic high risk and 
investment requirements, will be the advanced technologies of 
tomorrow. Instead, two trends could appear: 
  First, withdrawal from the mass markets into exclusive 
niches, since cost-covering prices can only be obtained by 
marketing special products. Of course, employment requirements 
will drop and there will be an insufficient cash-flow to ensure 
new developments. 
  Second, an innovations gap develops and the technological 
top 
position is lost. Should Germany be cut off from the 
technological "nourishment chain" because more and more links of 
that chain have been captured by American and Japanese 
competitors, this competency loss could only be made good--if it 
could be made good at all--through very high overall economics 
costs. 
  Catch 22 Situation. Technologically speaking, 
Germany finds herself in a double bind. On the one hand, Japan 
and the United States threaten to dominate the top technologies, 
and, on the other hand, cheap Asian and East European labor 
costs are pressuring traditional German mature products. Germany 
has found herself in this hopeless position between the leaders 
in top technologies and the low cost producers because she does 
not have a clear competitive advantage in either of the two 
fields. Rising unemployment and the growing number of needy 
industrial centers will tie up the resources required for 
technological renewal. 
  It is not yet known whether this vicious circle can be 
broken. While the German Federal budget is supposed to increase 
4.4% in 1994, the budget for research will remain 
nominally the 
same, i.e., it will drop in real terms. Due to reunification, 
the share of the economy's total expenditures for research in 
the gross domestic product has dropped dramatically from 
2.88% 
in 1989 to the 2.66% in 1991. The situation is aggravated 
by 
the fact that of the 85,000 researchers in East German industry 
in 1989, more than 70,000 have already been discharged. 
Deindustrialization in the former GDR is devastating the 
research community and is--to a great degree--retarding economic 
development there. 
  Competence. It is not yet sufficiently understood 
by the public that the loss of technological competence will 
inevitably result in strategic, i.e., long-term disadvantages 
and economic dependencies for Germany and for Europe. Defenders 
of the liberal foreign trade theory should realize that 
different laws pertain to the high technology markets and that 
it is extremely important whether a country producers microchips 
or potato chips. 
  Such purely statistical thinking completely misjudges the 
importance investments in the so-called key technologies play in 
our future. Our country's standard of living, which is based on 
innovation and export, is already endangered and significant 
cutbacks are predictable if we fall behind further 
technologically on the world market. 
  The following conclusions must be drawn: 
  First, resources have to be concentrated and strategically 
redirected. The federal government is already in debt for its 
two largest budget items--social services and debt servicing 
(according to the 1997 financial plan, 112 billion German marks 
[DM] in taxes alone) to the point where the scope of possible 
actions in promising future fields rapidly disappears. Financial 
resources used as subsidies to support dying industries--whether 
in western or eastern Germany--are no longer available for 
promising future developments. 
  Second, in concord with the strategic importance of high 
technology, research policy must also be strategically 
redirected. The presently held definition of research foci 
(priorities and posteriorities) is very promising in this 
regard. This approach must not be opposed by any orthodox 
economic policy. Rather, all parties must participate in the 
"strategic dialogue" between the political, economic, and 
scientific sectors initiated by former Minister of Research 
Riesenhuber. 
  An intensified concentration and coordination of efforts in 
research and technology is especially urgent at the European 
level. Instead of breaking down into innumerable scattered mini 
projects as happened in the case of JESSI, the European 
microelectronics initiative, far fewer, but essential research 
areas have to be established--each with precise targets. 
  Third, guidelines have to be established to promote 
innovation. Technological, structural, and economic policies 
must all be interconnected, especially in the new federal 
states, to ensure that all resources are concentrated in 
innovative nuclei. 
  Legislation ought not make research and production in the 
technologies of tomorrow impossible by imposing excessive 
conditions, thereby causing them to develop and flourish outside 
Germany. 
  The risk capital market for the founders of innovative 
companies is still very much underdeveloped in Germany. German 
inventors and new company founders often founder for lack of 
start-up capital for the economic utilization of their 
innovations. Governmental incentives for private capital lenders 
could improve the situation in this regard. 
  The transfer of the results of research to the appropriate 
companies must be accelerated. German basic scientific research 
is still predominate in many fields. Unfortunately, the economic 
profits that might be derived from scientific successes are 
often lost because the theoretical breakthroughs are not 
converted into real products quick enough. 
  The public must be made aware of the fact that our country 
is 
now confronted by a critical challenge, the meeting and mastery 
of which is mostly dependent on our innovative capability (in 
technical as well as societal matters). A comprehensive public 
discussion of problems pertaining to future technological 
developments, which would create understanding and acceptance 
for new economic and technical opportunities, is therefore 
highly desirable. The opening of East Europe has imparted an 
additional dynamic to the technological competition in the 
Europe-USA-Japan triad. At the same time, Germany is being 
confronted with another great challenge in the problems 
associated with unification. 
  All the more reason for a reevaluation of policies now. With 
respect to economic performance as measured by the per capita 
gross domestic product, Germany today is in the sixth position 
in Europe, behind Italy. Germany must rid herself of compulsive 
distribution and redistribution thinking and return net product 
to top priority. 
  We in Germany are currently warring over individual assets, 
while the sources of our collective standard of 
living--innovation, productivity, and strength on the world 
markets--are gradually drying up here at a time when they are 
bubbling forth in other countries. 
  It should be clear to all of us that international 
developments are not going to wait on Germany and that global 
competition is rapidly entering a new phase. In the second half 
of the 1980s, international direct investments grew three times 
more rapidly than did world trade. That alone illustrates the 
new, global dimension of technology, markets, and companies. 
"Global players," who research, produce, and sell in several 
countries, dominate the scene. 
  At the same time, people, capital, and know-how have become 
much more mobile. As Germany becomes less attractive as a site 
for research and production, companies react by selectively 
distributing their activities and resources geographically. As 
the exodus of development and production in the high technology 
sector proceeds, ever more top German researchers will leave the 
country because they will no longer be able to find the 
conditions necessary to pursue their work in Germany. 
  This trend will intensify the desire to cling desperately to 
obsolete production practices. We are investing too much money 
in trying to make outdated facilities more efficient, instead of 
transplanting them to low-wage countries, where they could 
continue to be operated profitably and the money that would have 
had to be invested to increase plant efficiency at home could 
flow into the development of new products. 
  It would be to our mutual benefit if these new production 
opportunities were quickly realized in the East European 
countries. In this way, Germany could both retain her position 
on the volume markets as well as stay abreast of the Japan-South 
East Asia and the United States-Mexico competition in high tech. 
  In addition, such a strategy would provide the basis for 
closer economic cooperation with the reformed East European 
countries. This strategy could provide the opportunity for 
Europe to transform its economies through its own efforts by 
means of free trade and industrial cooperation. Strengthening 
economic performance in the West and distributing certain other 
sectors of industrial work to our eastern neighbors could well 
be the basis for stability and well-being throughout Europe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Toward Legal Protection for </F>
Biotechnological Inventions in Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels--Following a meeting of the twelve 
ministers in charge of the EU [European Union] domestic market, 
held on 16 December, the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Robert 
Urbain, Belgian minister of European affairs, announced that the 
twelve had agreed on legal protection for biotechnological 
inventions within the Community. The draft directive (European 
law) aims first of all to promote the competitiveness of EU 
science and industry in the field of biotechnology. 
  "Because inventions could not be protected in Europe, recent 
years saw a European brain drain toward areas where their 
patents were better protected," Mr. Urbain pointed out. The 
draft directive makes it possible to patent therapeutic methods 
that modify the human genetic makeup, but it also establishes 
the basic principle that the human body cannot be patented. "We 
are not going to promote genetic engineering." 
  According to an expert, the objective is to pave the way for 
methods which offer prospects of curing hundreds of diseases, 
such as cystic fibrosis. It is understood that modifications 
must be undertaken solely for therapeutic purposes and must be 
fully consistent with human dignity. 
  According to a diplomatic source, Spain was opposed to all 
methods that would lead to a modification of the human genetic 
makeup. "But if such modifications are patentable, it does not 
follow that they will be allowed," the Belgian minister also 
pointed out. The draft directive must still be formally approved 
by a ministers council before coming into force, by 1996 at the 
latest.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Twelve Agree on the Fourth </F>
 R&amp;D 
Framework Program (1994-1998)"] 
  [Text] Brussels--On 22 December, the research ministers of 
the twelve members of the European Union [EU] agreed on their 
fourth R&amp;D framework program (PCRD), covering the period 
1994-1998, and allocated to it an overall budget of 12 billion 
ECUs [European currency units] plus a reserve of 1 billion ECUs; 
the announcement was made by the Belgian minister, Jean-Maurice 
Dehousse at the close of the meeting he chaired in Brussels, the 
third such meeting in three months. 
  The ministers followed the recommendations of the EU summit 
of 10-11 December. The heads of state and prime ministers 
proposed an overall budget of 12 billion ECUs with a one-billion 
reserve that might be released in 1996, after a survey of the 
results is made halfway through the program. 
  The European Commission had proposed an overall budget of 
13.1 billion ECUs, the European research commissioner, Mr. 
Antonio Ruberti, recalled. The agreement reached "guarantees the 
continuity of the EU research effort at a time when the EU is 
starting concerted efforts to revive the economy and 
competitiveness of the European system," he pointed out. 
  The European Parliament, whose agreement is required for the 
final adoption of the budget, had asked for a total allocation 
of 13.7 billion ECUs at the time of its first reading in 
November. 
  The ministers also decided how to distribute the funds among 
various activities: research proper will get 87.8 percent of the 
overall budget. Of this, research on information and 
communication technologies will get the lion's share with 28.20 
percent, followed by the energy sector (non-nuclear energy, 
nuclear fission safety, and thermonuclear fusion control) with 
18.65 percent. 
  Research on industrial technologies come in third position 
(16 percent), followed by life sciences (13.10 percent), 
environment (nine percent), transportation (two percent), and 
social and economic sciences (0.85 percent). 
  In addition, the framework program will finance researcher 
mobility and training, the dissemination and implementation of 
research results, and international cooperation. Finally, the 
ministers decided to earmark 875 million ECUs for the Joint 
Research Center, in Italy.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Publication of the Preliminary </F>
Orientation Report on the Major Objectives of French Research"] 
  [Text] Paris--The national debate on the main objectives of 
French research has begun now that the preliminary orientation 
report prepared by twenty-seven important figures in the fields 
of science, technology, and economics has been sent to the 
directors of the major organizations. 
  The report of about fifty pages is the result of five work 
sessions held in September and October. It will now be analyzed 
and evaluated by the academies (the Academy of Science and 
Academy of Ethical and Political Sciences) at College de France; 
by the Parliamentary Office for Scientific and Technological 
Options; by the conference of university presidents, deans of 
major educational institutions, and directors of engineering 
schools; by the heads of organizations such as CNRS, INRA, or 
INRIA; by the Economic and Social Council; by unions; and by 
cabinet ministers. 
  A new meeting of the study committee, in January, should 
incorporate findings stated in a new report due on 20 January at 
the latest, so as to form the focus for an in-depth 
institutional consultation and for national and regional forums, 
and later for a national summary debate as well (these being 
scheduled between 15 February and 31 March). The result should 
be a final orientation report intended to be the solid core of a 
document which will be sent to Parliament for debate during the 
spring 1994 session. 
  Francois Fillon, minister of Higher Education and Research, 
has been the moving force behind this vast national consultation 
on scientific and technological research policy for the coming 
years, which is meant to continue the national forum on research 
held twelve years ago at the initiative of Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement who was minister at the time. 
  For Robert Dautray, president of the study group and high 
commissioner for atomic energy, who commented on the preliminary 
report, one of the most difficult problems which absolutely must 
be included in assessments of higher education and research 
problems, is the increase in the number of students, the 
changing role of the teaching profession, and the resulting need 
for new opportunities. 
  The influx of students in general education further 
increases 
the importance of the problem. It would be appropriate to create 
training programs that are brief, technical, and less selective 
than the current IUT and BTS. There should be many more 
full-time instructors, and more university awareness of the 
industrial world and its problems. According to Jacques Friedel, 
president of the Academy of Sciences, it would be appropriate 
for researchers to crown their careers in an academic setting. 
  Another problem is the question of major research equipment, 
indispensable but increasingly expensive tools which often 
require joint purchase and management with many countries. Basic 
research must in no way be neglected or channelled because it 
nurtures future applied research, according to Catherine 
Cesarsky, an astronomer at CEA (Saclay). French basic research 
is good, recognized in countries abroad and in turn more open to 
them because it has improved during the past ten years. It 
provides five percent of the material in major scientific 
publications. France's competition must be met, its engineering 
research increased, its risk-taking encouraged, and its chronic 
conservatism overcome. 
  For the study group, and particularly for Pierre Douzou, 
member of the Academy, life sciences, medical research and 
agronomic research with their applications are increasingly 
converging at a fundamental level through genetic studies, but 
too often, except for the pharmacological sector, industrial 
applications are late in coming or fall short of expectations. 
  Concerning the major programs which are also at the core of 
these investigations, second only to space problems, the 
preliminary report finds as does Jacques-Louis Lions, former 
CNES president, that it behooves the government, if it chooses 
these programs, to also set their goals concretely, clearly, 
with specific objectives and timeframes. They should be 
evaluated openly and he did not deny that the computer, 
supergenerator, and space programs should have been reassessed 
in a timely fashion. 
  Thanks to their increasing capabilities and speed, computers 
have become a universal tool which spill over into all fields 
such as aeronautics research as a whole. The constant influence 
of present circumstances and of economic problems on industrial 
research, which together with innovation in PME-PMI (small and 
medium enterprises) is still much too inadequate, often has 
negative effects. At the same time transfer of knowledge and 
technology continues to take place too slowly and badly, notably 
with respect to small enterprises, partly because of inadequate 
basic research which is not "finalized" and because work likely 
to be of interest to research and already performed in 
laboratories is not well known. 
  According to Pierre Aigrain, former minister, the 
preliminary 
report has drawn up a list of questions and has defined some of 
them very well. According to him, for science and technology to 
play their proper role today, research has to be less 
compartmentalized, has to recover its flexibility while keeping 
its discipline, its quality, its very excellence; its work must 
be held relevant to industrial requirements. 
  In a way, according to sociologist Alain Touraine, science 
has to become more community-oriented and scientists must 
examine the ways in which the consequences of knowledge affect 
society.

<F P=106> [Article by STUe: "An SPD Government's Idea of Research: `A </F>
Great Coalition of Reason,' More Money, the Energy Policy"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 10 Dec--A federal government headed by the 
Social Democrats would want to set in motion a broad dialogue 
between the economic sector, science, the labor unions, and the 
state on the direction technological development should take and 
the individual measures to be instituted. Vosen, the research 
policy spokesman for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] group in the Bundestag, said in Bonn that a social 
consensus on this domain does not at present exist in Germany, 
as demonstrated by the examples of genetic engineering, nuclear 
power, or the transrapid. "We need a great coalition of reason 
for research that cuts across all party boundaries," Vosen 
insisted. The SPD politician conceded that this consensus did 
not exist in his party either on a good many issues. Thus, 
unlike Social Democratic traffic politicians, he came out in 
favor of a transrapid application line in Germany. The call for 
"more boldness in technology!" is also aimed at the SPD. 
  Vosen presented a 10-page "blueprint for a research and 
technology policy for the SDP-government program." Agreement on 
the paper has not, to be sure, been reached with Glotz, the 
member of the election campaign team responsible for education 
and research, but it will have some influence on the program. In 
the paper he says that the existing obstacles to innovations in 
law and administration must be eliminated. Vosen demanded that 
the research budget, which in past years has served as a "piggy 
bank," be clearly increased from 1995 on. If the budget had 
grown since 1986 as the entire national budget has, DM3 billion 
more would be available for research in 1994 instead of just the 
actual DM9.47 billion. 
  The SPD differs from the coalition in its assessment of 
nuclear energy. The SPD lays stronger emphasis on the 
development of renewable sources of energy and energy 
conservation technologies. Moreover, it focuses chiefly on the 
"humanization" of working conditions, research on peace and 
conflicts, and the humanities. The government has come more into 
line with the SPD's criticism of the costly manned space 
programs because of the shortage of funds. Additional major 
focal points cited in the SPD plan are the development of 
research on the environment and health, the strengthening of 
stat-of-the-art technologies like information technology and 
telecommunications, genetic engineering and biotechnology, 
research on materials, and the development of new fuels and 
ideas for dealing with traffic. Vosen came out in favor of the 
reintroduction of tax support for research and demanded legally 
established rights for the Bundestag to take part in government 
decisions on research programs. Vosen attested to Minister of 
Research Krueger's (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) good 
intentions. But he said that Krueger had been unable to assert 
himself up to now, as the budget debates demonstrated. He does 
not even have much to say in his own house. He said that the 
"secret minister of research" is Krueger's secretary of state, 
Ziller.

"Technology Centers/162 Centers in Germany - Establishment Boom 
in New States - Example for East Europe. Rexrodt Criticizes 
Business's Innovation Failing"; first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] Berlin, Tuesday, 30 Nov 93 
(HANDELSBLATT)--Technology and founder centers have proven their 
worth as a tool for regional business development and promotion 
of innovation in the federal republic. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft 
Deutscher Technologie- und Grunderzentren e.V. 
[Association 
of German Technology and Founder Centers Registered Association] 
(ADT) has drawn this conclusion. 
  The occasion is the establishment of the first German 
technology center in Berlin (BIG) 10 years ago, which thus far 
has been followed by 161 additional foundings of centers over 
the entire territory of the federal republic. However, 
innovation centers are not a wonder drug by which jobs can be 
guaranteed in inefficient or uncompetitive companies, said Heinz 
Fiedler, head of ADT's managing board, putting a damper on 
excessive expectations at the fifth anniversary of his 
association. 
  Particularly in the new federal states, where a real boom 
has 
developed since the change, "creating the bases for the 
development of small and medium-sized businesses" is of prime 
importance. Therefore, according to Fiedler, the centers in 
Eastern Germany are not serving mainly technology companies, but 
on the whole are oriented toward the promotion of 
entrepreneurship. 
  In this sense, in the association's opinion, German 
innovation centers could also serve as a model for comparable 
institutions in the East European countries. However, a copy of 
the successful models from the West is not possible. Instead, 
the designs have to be adapted to the particular requirements in 
East Europe. However, Fiedler judges that this should cause no 
problem, because in Germany too each center is oriented toward 
local concerns and therefore is "somewhat different from the 
others." According to ADT, by now 100 founder centers exist in 
the former COMECON countries. 
  Fifty-two centers have come into being in the new federal 
states, and they are distinguished by strong expansion of their 
regional offerings. Today they are offering to 500 companies 
with 3000 employees a business-oriented infrastructure that is 
assisting in the move into independence. More than 22,000 
employees of just under 2700 companies are now working at 
innovation and founder centers in all of Germany. Just a few 
have given up in the last 10 years according to ADT. 
  Because the innovation centers are regional initiatives, 
their spatial distribution differs very much over the territory 
of Germany. For example, while Bavaria has just four such 
centers, the intensive development in North Rhine-Westphalia has 
resulted in the establishment of 49 facilities. Saturation has 
been reached by now in some federal states, says ADT head Guido 
Baranowski. In his opinion both public and private-industry 
models have proven their worth in financing. In any case, the 
innovation centers have to make their terms and conditions 
market oriented in the long run, in their own interest and also 
in the interest of their companies. 
  Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Rexrodt (FDP [Free 
Democratic Party]) in the prelude to ADT's anniversary 
criticized German industry's failing in innovation. The reasons 
for this lie in companies themselves too, the minister said. 
Financial relief and beneficial tax incentives alone can bring 
about no fundamental changes. In this connection, Rexrodt also 
called for a better functioning venture capital market in 
Germany. In spite of the numerous venture capital funds in the 
meanwhile, no breakthrough has been attained to date in this 
area.

<F P=106> [Article by Riitta-Eliisa Laine: "Science and Technology </F>
Council Emphasizes Research Quality; Efforts to Increase 
Research's Share of Funding in Finland"] 
  [Text] The Science and Technology Council's development 
strategy lays emphasis on a policy based on knowledge and 
know-how in Finland in the 1990s despite the country's economic 
difficulties. 
  "It is absolutely essential for us to be able to get beyond 
the recession so that the basis of our know-how is preserved and 
we can reap the fruits of our investments in a national system 
of innovations in the future as well," the chairman of the 
council, Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), said during a 
press conference on the report in Helsinki on Friday. 
  According to him, it is also a question of changes in 
challenges. "Internationalization is imposing a demand for 
absolute quality. Only high-quality products are successful on 
international markets, just as only research that represents the 
international level has a chance of participating in 
international collaboration on equal terms." 
<H5>  Funding for Research Must Be Realistically Increased </H5>
  The report that outlines the three-year period, 1994-1996, 
"A 
Finland of Knowledge and Know-How," considers it to be 
especially important for us to be able to realistically increase 
funding for research and do it so that the percentage of the 
gross national product (GNP) invested in research increases. 
Both private firms and the state must increase funding for 
research. The goal is a 2.7-percent share of the GNP by 1997. 
With this relative investment Finland would rank fifth among the 
OECD countries this year. 
  The Science and Technology Council points out that 
government 
funding for research will clearly be reduced next year. The 
detrimental effects of the cuts will especially heavily hit the 
universities. The council considers preservation of their 
ability to operate to be important. According to it, university 
research resources would have to be developed in cooperation 
with the Academy of Finland. 
<H5>  Painful Decisions Have to Be Made </H5>
  We must be able to improve the quality and productivity of 
research. As the chief ways of doing this, Aho cited making 
appropriations more competitive, systematic evaluation of 
research projects, and structural improvement of research 
activities. 
  "We are also inevitably facing painful decisions: the 
reallocation of funds and the elimination of poor quality 
research without prospects of success," Aho said. 
  In its development strategy the Science and Technology 
Council expresses the view that, in addition, new funds are 
needed to achieve objectives of current importance and to 
strengthen our future know-how. 
<H5>  More Funds Through Budget-Internal Transfers </H5>
  "In connection with this, the council has concentrated on 
the 
status of basic research and the universities and on the 
possibilities of increasing our contribution to research and 
development projects stemming from the needs of the future 
through budget-internal transfers of funds. It is obvious that 
the new funds must be channeled to carefully selected projects," 
Aho said. 
  The vice chairman of the council, Minister Seppo Kaariainen 
(Center Party), pointed out that the development of private 
sector activities based on knowledge and know-how will have a 
significant effect on the society's ability to create new jobs. 
  "This development will be stronger than it has been in the 
future. For example, the electrical equipment and electronics 
industry has itself estimated that it will need 10,000 new, 
well-trained employees for research, production, and marketing 
jobs over the next few years." 
<H5>  Opportunities for Innovations Must Be Created </H5>
  According to him, if it is implemented, this development 
would have noticeably more far-reaching effects on employment 
when we include the indirect effects on employment in 
subcontracting networks and the service sector. "It goes without 
saying that the public sector must protect opportunities for 
realizing this development by developing a national innovation 
system," Kaariainen said. 
  As a member of the council who participated in the study, 
Prof. Ilkka Niiniluoto was, like the other investigators, 
satisfied with the report's appropriation guidelines. "The 
message is ideally suited to raising people's spirits, which are 
currently at a very low ebb in the universities," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by EU [European Union] correspondent in Brussels </F>
Philippe Lemaitre: "Aid to State-Owned Companies: Brussels Puts 
Pressure on France to Disclose Bull's Recovery Program"--first 
paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] Through its commissioner to competition, Karel Van 
Miert, the European Commission expressed its impatience at the 
French government's apparent reluctance to disclose Bull's and 
Air France's recovery programs. 
  Bull, Air France: the French government is paying 
considerable sums to these state-owned companies without 
submitting to the European Commission the recovery programs it 
is preparing. Before giving its green light, the EC must 
evaluate whether the efforts undertaken are likely to restore 
the viability of the troubled groups. Karel Van Miert, the 
commissioner in charge of competition, is losing patience at the 
French government's procrastination, especially in Bull's case. 
  "We have reached a completely illegal situation," he told LE 
MONDE. "The French government has been promising us a 
restructuring plan for months, but nothing is coming and there 
are complaints from competing manufacturers in other Community 
countries. This puts the Commission in an impossible position. 
The Commission cannot approve any more payments, or it will have 
to refer the case to the European Court." 
<H5>  Unpleasant Surprise </H5>
  The commissioner noted that the French are quick to protest 
when they find that Brussels is not diligent enough in going 
after abusive state subsidies: Francis Mer, the Usinor-Sacilor 
CEO [chief executive officer], recently regretted that the 
Commission does not impose a more severe rationalization of 
state-owned steelmakers in Italy, Spain, and the East German 
provinces. It was also at France's and the United Kingdom's 
request that the Commission demanded--and obtained--that the 
Austrian government recover two-thirds of the subsidies granted 
to Grundig to build a plant in Austria. "The Commission must be 
able to act consistently," he said. 
  Mr. Van Miert recalled the episodes of the Bull serial: 4 
billion francs [Fr] in 1992, which the French government 
presented as a capital increase but which the Commission 
actually viewed as state subsidies; Fr2.5 billion in February 
1993, paid by the State and France Telecom. In October, after 
many contacts with the French government, the Commission started 
the procedure on state subsidies contained in the treaty. The 
plan promised by Mr. Longuet before the summer holidays, then 
after the summer, was not disclosed. The Brussels departments 
were given "broad orientations"! 
  In December, the Commission was unpleasantly surprised to 
learn that a new Fr4 billion instalment was granted to Bull. "In 
addition, new payments are scheduled for this year, so that 
total subsidies might reach Fr15 billion, i.e. Fr1,000 per 
taxpaying household!," Mr. Van Miert worries; he is obviously 
determined to prevent France from allowing itself to follow that 
course. 
  Abel Matutes, the transportation commissioner, is in charge 
of the Air France case, but Mr. Van Miert observed that, in this 
case too, the French government is doing exactly as it likes. 
The State already paid Fr1.5 billion and intends to grant a 
total of Fr6 billion to Fr7 billion. However, under pressure 
from strikers, the restructuring plan devised by Bernard Attali, 
the former Air France CEO, was abandoned. What will his 
successor, Christian Blanc's plan be like? Will it be convincing 
enough for the Commission to approve the injection of the 
billions required to save the national airline? Mr. Van Miert 
seems skeptical, noting in passing that Lufthansa, the German 
company, eliminated 7,000 jobs but is about to restore its 
financial balance. Without state subsidies.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "Innovation: The Government </F>
Launches a Major Consultation; New Research Policy 
Orientations"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] The minister of higher education and research has 
built up a conviction. His priorities: the environment, medical 
research, aeronautics, innovation in small to mid-size 
industries. 
  "For a country like France, it is in the nation's best 
interest to question itself about the main orientations of its 
scientific policy." To start his mandate, Francois Fillon, the 
minister of higher education and research, decided to send 
French research back to the drawing board. 
  To this effect, he just launched a broad national 
consultation among researchers in public and industrial 
laboratories in order to identify priority orientations for 
French research. This consultation is accompanied by a so-called 
"Delphi" survey (based on a method developed in Japan) of 3,000 
experts. 
  The time to perform such an audit is not necessarily 
ill-chosen. Things have changed since the National Research 
Conference organized by Jean-Pierre Chevenement 12 years ago. 
First of all, the economic context: During a recession, research 
cannot escape cutbacks. Actually, the ratio of research 
expenditures to the gross domestic product has stopped 
increasing in several countries, including France, where it 
remains stable around 2.42 percent. The era of triumphant 
science is past, and the abandonment of a large program such as 
the Hermes space shuttle marked a return to greater realism. 
Especially considering that the image of science and technology 
has changed in the public's mind. 
  "Ten years ago, it was thought that boosting research would 
improve living conditions. Today, the public believes that 
science destroys employment," claimed a spokesman for the 
working group created by Francois Fillon to do the spadework 
prior to the great national debate on research. In this changed 
context, redefining priorities is probably not a luxury. 
  Already, the minister identified a few major orientations: 
environment, medical research for which an additional 100 
million francs [Fr] will be included in the 1994 budget, and a 
similar amount for upstream research in aeronautics, and 
innovation in small to mid-size businesses. The national 
consultation should make it possible to better define this 
research policy, which will be submitted to the Parliament 
during its spring session. 
  The working group, consisting of 26 members and headed by 
Robert Dautray, the high commissioner to atomic energy, just 
submitted its first conclusions. Their observations contain no 
real surprises: Basic research is good enough, but basic 
technological research remains inadequate; as for industrial 
research, not enough of it is financed by the businesses 
themselves, it is excessively concentrated by sectors, and small 
to mid-size industries are not adequately represented. 
  As a result, in years to come the ministry should focus a 
greater proportion of its efforts on basic technological 
research. "To ensure that it remains competitive, a country like 
ours needs first of all a strong technological research and 
efficient procedures to transfer the knowledge acquired to 
industrial applied research," the working group insisted. 
Unfortunately, engineering sciences have been "relatively 
neglected in France, in particular those involving expertise in 
complex systems and objects." 
  Another failure of French research is the relative 
inadequacy 
of "traditional" sectors such as building and construction, 
chemicals, transportation, and the agrifood business, although 
these sectors account for much of the economy and employment. A 
special effort was made in the 1994 budget in favor of the 
agrifood business, which doubled in recent years but 
nevertheless invested on the average only 0.35 percent of its 
sales in research, although it must integrate a whole series of 
new technologies (clean plants, high-pressure sterilization, 
ionization, etc.). The three-year program called "Tomorrow's 
Food," which is totally in line with the "Food for the Year 
2000" program, will get Fr40 million, "i.e. 50 percent more than 
the annual average for `Food for the Year 2000'," people at the 
ministry pointed out. 
  Immediate measures were also taken to support innovation in 
small to mid-size businesses: The ANVAR [National Agency for the 
Implementation of Research] budget will be 16 percent higher in 
1994, reaching Fr1 billion. Actually, small to mid-size 
businesses are underrepresented in French research; they 
contribute only 16 percent of the national effort. But their 
involvement in research is not just a matter of money. 
Businesses must also have men capable of taking over knowledge 
and translating it into innovations. In this respect, the 
minister decided to double the credits allocated to Cortechs 
(agreements to train senior technicians through research) and he 
intends to promote Cifres (industrial research-training 
agreements), two procedures that will enable businesses to hire 
researchers and technicians for limited periods. 
<H5>  A Maze of Procedures and Parties Involved </H5>
  Regional centers for innovation and industrial transfer 
(CRITTs), industrial relation committees (Crins) of the CNRS 
[National Center for Scientific Research], industrial technical 
centers: There is no lack of structures to help businesses in 
their innovation efforts. Should more be created? Certainly not, 
people at the ministry answered. It is already hard enough for 
businesses, especially the smaller ones, to find their way 
through the maze of parties and procedures involved. Obviously, 
some clarification is needed, and the ministry will undertake a 
study of the matter during 1994. The region might provide a 
rather suitable frame to improve the structure of the scientific 
and technical environment of businesses: "In each region, we 
must cause the emergence of a network of laboratories working 
with overall cohesion," the minister's staff explained. 
  Still in order to help businesses, the working group 
recommended to eliminate the restriction introduced in 1992 on 
the research tax credit, a measure that has the manufacturers' 
unanimous approval. 
  The working group also emphasized the need to strengthen the 
ties between public and private research, something on which 
everybody agrees. Joint laboratories represent interesting 
experiments, the group noted. What is required is to evaluate 
these experiments, put and end to those that are no longer 
useful, and create new laboratories with well-defined stakes and 
for predetermined probable durations. "Businesses that wish to 
do so should be able to collaborate with public research at high 
level," Francois Fillon stated for his part, quoting the example 
of the Bioavenir program, which associates Rhone-Poulenc and 
several university and CNRS laboratories. Certainly, the time 
when these two worlds used to distrust each other seems to be 
gone for good.

<F P=106> [Article by Prof. Dr. Gerhard Zeidler, chairman of the board </F>
of Alcatel SEL AG and chairman of the BDI Committee on Research 
and Technology Policy: "Ten Tasks of a Technology Council for 
Networking of Strategies for the Future"] 
  [TEXT]The question of which technology policy is the best 
is the source of much debate, as has been clearly demonstrated 
by twenty years of argument over the issue within Germany. 
  The pursuance of a technology policy characterized by the 
following is more damaging than the complete renunciation of any 
such policy: 
  - The objective of the policy rapidly fluctuates between the 
"struggle to attain world leadership in the field of high 
technology" and the "preservation of that which we have 
achieved". 
  - With regard to the degree of interventionism, the policy 
vacillates between endorsing state-run enterprises and a 
laissez-faire approach -- as well as every shade between the two. 
  - The programmatic orientation of the policy fluctuates 
between the support of broad-based and the support of 
cutting-edge research. 
  - In terms of volume, the policy attempts to accomplish more 
than is allowed for by current budgetary planning. 
  - Rather than providing a comprehensive view of technology 
creation, the policy wavers back and forth between assessing the 
state of technology and assessing the effects of legislation. 
  - It attempts to place the blame for the reluctance by 
public 
to accept new technologies on a few disgruntled teachers and 
journalists. 
  - The policy defines a "composite department" as one at 
which 
all other departments can slash away at will. 
  - The policy encourages researchers to adopt a more 
businesslike manner while at the same time calling upon 
businessmen to have more community spirit. 
  - The policy-makers are never able to offer 
internally-produced reports on the strategy of the policy, only 
those generated by consulting firms, Frauenhofer institutes, or 
commissions. 
  - When it comes to urgent national requirements, the 
policy-makers repeatedly stall for time by pointing to the 
European Union (EU) in Brussels. 
  Such a policy is worse than a (theoretically conceivable) 
complete renunciation of any technology policy, the economic 
effect of which can at least be calculated and its consequences 
plotted. 
  The Sixth Conference on Technology of the Federal 
Association 
of German Industry (BDI), held on 18 November 1993, made it 
clear once again that less-than-desirable conditions are making 
it impossible for key technological fields to fully contribute 
to the gross national product. 
  For example, the architects of the health reform did not 
take 
the effects on pharmaceutical research sufficiently into 
account. Spokesmen from the chemical industry state that many 
years of market opportunities were wasted as a result of the 
genetic engineering law alone. Through the Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology, the German government subsidizes 
composite materials, the existence of which the environmental 
ministry is apparently unaware, as it has included complete 
recyclability (i.e., separation of materials) among its 
objectives. 
  The list goes on. In short, a general lack of coordination 
and cooperation is evident everywhere. This is no minor slip-up, 
but a strategic error within our technology policy. Technology 
policy must not be limited to technical matters; it must evolve 
into an innovation policy. 
  The lack of coordination (by whom is immaterial) that most 
branches of industry are only now beginning to recognize has 
long been obvious to those industries that deal with 
infrastructures. It is no coincidence that the Maastricht Treaty 
for the EU emphasizes the importance of "trans-European 
networks" for energy, traffic, and communications. In order to 
optimize traffic, for example, it is essential to have not only 
technological, but even more importantly, organizational 
infrastructures. 
  No individual sector has the comprehensive know-how 
necessary 
to build infrastructures. Consequently, it is counterproductive 
for each individual sector to attempt to create its own. The 
most important prerequisite for the creation of infrastructures 
within Germany as a business location in the nineteen nineties 
is networked strategies developed by commercial and public 
institutions. 
  Agreement between various departments will become 
increasingly critical, and not merely to the creation and 
maintenance of infrastructures. Cooperation between the 
research, health, environmental, and labor ministries may be as 
important to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, for 
example, as cooperation between the transportation and postal 
ministries is to the creation of traffic and communications 
infrastructures. 
  Two policy decisions have recently been made that are of 
great importance to the needed innovation campaign. The first of 
these was the heartening decision by the Federal Cabinet in 
favor of the Transrapid. This decision must not be reversed, nor 
can it remain an isolated one. We must overcome the Wackersdorf 
syndrome and integrate the Transrapid into the transportation 
network. 
  The second decision was the decision to create a "Strategic 
Council for Research and Technology" within the BMFT as well as 
the creation of similar discussion rounds for the Federal 
Chancellor and the economics minister. This decision by the 
research minister represents an important step forward, one to 
which the parties and caucuses have obviously responded 
favorably. The Federal President put it quite clearly: 
"Economic, research, and technology policy should draw even 
closer together and evolve into a single entity. I am not 
referring here to a German version of the MITI (Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry). State dirigism is never 
innovative. It can neither stimulate nor replace efforts by 
industry to develop new ideas. However, within the framework of 
a dialog between all parties, the state can provide assistance 
in the reaching of a consensus on technological issues and in 
the orchestration of the many decentralized efforts." This has 
nothing to do with state control of industry or investments, 
however. 
  The Commission for the Future, headed by Minister President 
Teufel of Baden-Wuerttemberg, also called for a council on 
technological strategy. This proposal does not suggest a 
"Council of Wise Men" in the sense of a "national board of 
directors." Rather, it calls for the creation of a vehicle, 
which, via a combination of high-ranking individuals and an 
effective level of activity, will bring the issue into the 
German political arena on behalf of Europe and address both the 
practical problems involved with the coordinated development of 
infrastructures and other issues as well. Another important 
function of this council should be furthering public acceptance 
of new technologies. The marketplace is the sole test of public 
acceptance. 
  In my opinion, such a strategic council should be assigned 
the following ten tasks: 
  1. It should increase the political importance of research 
and technology issues without eclipsing the cost crisis 
generated by politics and wages. 
  2. It must provide models and visions that demonstrate the 
importance of new technologies, not only to prosperity and 
employment, but also to the attainment of other social 
objectives. These include such widely diversified aims as 
victory over hunger, war, and AIDS through the use of 
biotechnology, increasingly recycling-oriented design, 
resource-efficient energy supply, and the overcoming of distance 
via modern traffic and communication systems. 
  3. It must make it clear that it is becoming increasingly 
difficult for commercial enterprises to implement innovative new 
product lines without assistance. They require supporting 
legislation and administration (licensing procedures) and, in 
many cases, long-term political support (as in the case of 
energy). The council must serve as a political go-between. It 
must develop strategies for introducing complex new innovative 
product lines. 
  4. It must ensure that new lines of technology are married 
with infrastructure projects (including those that are privately 
financed) and innovative public procurement. 
  5. It must evaluate the entire technology policy and, in 
particular, new legislative proposals in terms of innovation. 
  6. It has the task of developing criteria for an efficient, 
strategically oriented, policy for supporting research and 
technology, including tax-supported research support. 
  7. The council must promote the strategic reform of the 
German research landscape (more application-orientation, 
competition for external funding). 
  8. It must decide whether strategic dependencies (in the 
microelectronics field, for example) should be tolerated or 
discouraged. 
  9. It must ensure that research support by the EU, the 
Federal Republic of Germany, and the laender is adequately 
dovetailed in terms of strategy. 
  10. Finally, the council must discuss whether German 
technology policy should be augmented, either temporarily or on 
a long-term basis, by additional innovative and structural tasks 
such as those currently confronting Germany as a business 
location as it endeavors to integrate the new laender. 
  The BDI will determine by Easter whether a consensus with 
the 
political community can be reached on the basis of such a task 
list. The industrial community has already begun to prepare for 
the strategic dialog. Where necessary, it will support that 
which is to be achieved through common strategies of the 
political, administrative, scientific, and industrial 
communities via an industry-wide internal dialog, such as on 
issues of common technology development and subcontracting. For 
without internal networking and coordination, industry will be 
unable to fully participate in the strategic dialog.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Augereau: "Europe Reaches an </F>
Agreement on Manned Flights"] 
  [Text] Eventually, it took the Europeans over one year 
after their Granada (Spain) meeting of November 1992, to reach 
an agreement on their manned space flight policy. Following 
several postponements, in October and December 1993, 
representatives of ESA (European Space Agency) member states 
agreed on Tuesday 18 January, after a marathon negotiation. 
  The Europeans decided to provide preliminary financing over 
the next two years for the MSTP (Manned Space Transportation 
Program) supported by the French (up to 107 million accounting 
units[.sup]1[/]) and for the Columbus program pushed by the 
Germans (270 million accounting units). The Europeans will meet 
again in mid-1995 to decide whether or not to proceed with these 
programs. 
  The first of these programs, the cost to completion of which 
was estimated last September at a little under 2 billion 
accounting units, aims to service orbital space stations with 
two vehicles: the CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle), a sort of large 
capsule capable of carrying men and equipment; and the ATV 
(Automated Transfer Vehicle), an intelligent service module 
required for setting manned modules and capsules into orbit and 
for their rendezvous operations. According to the ESA, the 
second flight of the new European Ariane-5 launcher, in 1996, 
might provide an opportunity to launch a sort of unmanned 
pre-CTV. 
  The second program, Columbus, has an estimated cost of 2.3 
billion accounting units; it will involve building a manned 
module, the APM (Attached Pressurized Module), which is becoming 
less ambitious as time and budgets go by and should one day be 
added to the future international space station concocted by the 
Americans and the Russians, soon to be joined by the Europeans 
and the Japanese. 
  The ESA council decided to implement an "Act in council" 
that 
should soon bring the MSTP and Columbus programs under a single 
banner, making it easier to negotiate with manufacturers and to 
join forces for the negotiations with Moscow and Washington. 
Footnotes 
  1. One accounting unit is worth about 7 French francs.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Francois Fillon Confirms `The </F>
Government's Intention to Make Research a National Priority'"] 
  [Text] Paris--According to a statement on 6 December by 
Francois Fillon in his New Year's greetings to the media, the 
French government "is politically determined to make research a 
national priority," and is relying heavily on the major debates 
now taking place to define by June the broad outlines of the 
national scientific policy. 
  The Minister of Higher Education and Research emphasized 
that 
"in Europe, France is the only country where the research budget 
is increasing, even if modestly. I can tell you that during my 
meetings with colleagues from neighboring countries, I learned 
that budgetary constraints were affecting their research much 
more severely than our own." 
  The minister added that the national debate has been opened. 
It will continue with the organization of a series of six 
regional conferences, the first of which to take place in Le 
Mans on 14 February, followed by others in Marseille, Grenoble, 
Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Lille before the concluding national 
debate scheduled for 9 April in Paris. 
  Fillon further said that "the preliminary task force report 
being circulated since 26 November has already inspired some 
fifty responses, mostly but not exclusively from the major 
research institutions." The 30,000 copies of the final report 
will be mailed out beginning on 1 February so that in-depth 
institutional studies may get started. 
  The six scheduled conferences will address research and 
innovation in PME-PMI (small and medium size enterprises), 
reports from the scientific and social communities, research and 
enterprises aimed at competitiveness, basic research, ways of 
enhancing "France's assets," advanced training and research 
organizations: structures and trades, and finally, the 
international scope of research. 
  Fillon does not want these conferences, each of which will 
involve around 300 invited participants, to become "High 
Masses," but rather to generate "genuine dialogue." He expressed 
hope that they will result in important ideas from which the 
government will formulate the scientific and technological 
policies required by the country's development and by the 
international context. He did not conceal his support of 
proposals for a five-year or programming law as in the case of 
Defense, but he acknowledged that these proposals would probably 
have to wait until after the 1995 election. 
  In response to some questions, Fillon said he hoped that the 
new French space policy "would be defined soon. My ministry has 
expressed its views on the subject but the Ministry of Industry 
is the one in charge of Space." The minister announced that the 
first contract between the government and research organizations 
would probably be signed with the Atomic Energy Commission 
(CEA), then with the National Institute for Computer and 
Automation Research (INRIA). 
  With more specific reference to higher education, the 
minister restated his intention of initiating as of this year "a 
genuine technological track" and to intensify efforts to reduce 
the concentration of his ministry's departments toward colleges 
and universities, through the proven approach of 
decentralization.

<F P=106> [Article by Caroline Monnot: "Following the European </F>
Commissioners' Meeting, Brussels Will Freeze 2.5-Billion-Franc 
Aid for Bull"] 
  [Text] Brussels is expected to freeze temporarily the 
second installment of the capital appropriation that the French 
government was planning to give to Bull. Karel van Miert will 
notify Paris of the decision on Wednesday 26 January, after the 
commissioners' meeting. The freeze applies to the 2.5 billion 
francs [Fr] that were to supplement a first contribution of 
Fr4.5 billion made available in December 1993. Actually, the 
government promised to pay Fr7 billion in new money to Bull 
during 1993 and 1994. To this amount should be added the 
contributions made by the other shareholders: France Telecom, 
which paid Fr1 billion of the planned Fr1.4 billion, and NEC, 
with a little under Fr400 million. IBM declined to provide any 
additional capital to the French state-owned group. 
  People in Brussels refuse to dramatize the freeze. "We are 
merely applying the regulations in force concerning aid. The 
French government did notify us of these payments. But part of 
the payments was made available before the Commission had 
decided on the case," they explained. The European executive 
branch denies any intention to engage in a power struggle with 
Paris: "It's a rather measured reaction. European Court 
precedents enabled us to suspend the payments already made. This 
option was not accepted." 
  According to the Commission, the freeze will give Paris some 
more respite. People in Brussels said they were still waiting 
for Bull's famous strategic plan, which Gerard Longuet promised 
at the beginning of summer. In an interview with LA 
TRIBUNE-DESFOSSES, on Wednesday 26 January, the minister of 
industry blamed the delay on the burden of the past. "We 
inherited 10 years of ambiguity in Bull's management," he said. 
"Do not ask us to correct a 10-year trend in just 10 months." 
And he added: "It will take us two years."

<H3>  SPD: Intergenerational Commitments Can Be Built Only Upon 
the New Technologies. </H3>
  SPD research policy makers like Josef Vosen find "the 
growing 
loss in importance of research and technology policy" to be 
"nothing short of irresponsible." By the middle of the projected 
decline, the speaker on research policy of the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] calculates that "the share of the 
research budget will sink below 2% of the federal budget 
for 
the first time in 20 years. And in view of these numbers there 
can certainly be no question" of a research policy initiative by 
the government coalition. 
  More than in the past years, the German Social Democrats now 
also see in research and technology policy a way out of the 
economic crisis. What was previously the province of a few 
specialists in the Federal Parliament is increasingly becoming a 
prime-time topic. Still in mid November, Rudolf Scharping 
allotted unusually much space to research and technology policy 
at the party conference in Wiesbaden. Also Oskar Lafontaine, the 
economic and political forecaster of the Social Democrats, has 
always granted it a central roll in the "future perspectives for 
a model Germany." 
  In the "Government Program 1994" Commission, a task force 
under the direction of Peter Glotz is currently developing a 
concept of a research and technology policy for the SPD's 
government program. It is supposed to be presented early next 
year. 
  An early outline of this conceptualization is already taking 
shape. "Above all," according to Vosen, "we must again give 
research policy the importance it deserves." In the view of SPD 
research policy makers, that should also have an discernable 
affect on the research budget. According to Ocsar Lafontaines' 
criticism of the government, "German unity is [still] not being 
reflected at all in the research budget." And still at the 
beginning of December at the SPD's science forum, Peter Glotz 
calculated that, since the beginning of the current government 
coalition, federal expenditures for research have fallen from 
121 German marks per capita in 1981 to 97 German marks in 1992. 
  "If the research budget had grown since 1986 the way the 
federal budget has," an SPD paper on research policy says, it 
would "mean a sum of about 12.5 billion German marks" for the 
1994 budget of Federal Minister for Research and Technology Paul 
Krueger. In fact, Krueger has only just 9.47 billion German 
marks at his disposal. Therefore, the Social Democrats want to 
increase the research budget by at least a "minimum" of one 
billion German marks. 
  The differences between the government coalition's and the 
SPD's ideas on research and technology policy are notably small 
in principle regarding the question of financing. Both are 
primarily concerned with improving the competitiveness of the 
German economy and improving living conditions. 
  There are, however, significant differences in the details. 
The Social Democrats want to again take up the nearly expired 
middle class assistance for senior citizens and make more money 
available for the transfer of technology. A significant 
difference is also their demand, which is supported by industry, 
for tax benefits for investments in the area of research and 
development. 
  At the same time the SPD wants to again take up the expired 
"Humanization of Work" program and direct more funds into the 
research and development of renewable energies and energy-saving 
technologies. 
  The SPD wants to decrease funding above all for basic 
research in large-scale research directions, for space flight 
and high-energy and elementary particle physics. The 
possibilities for intervening in the factors controlling human 
heredity would have to remain under federal control. 
  For the SPD, research has thus also become an "extremely 
important element in policy concerning the labor market and 
industry." "Social security benefits can only be safeguarded 
though the jobs of future generations," according to the Social 
Democrats' conceptualization of research policy. 
"Intergenerational commitments can be built only upon the new 
technologies."

<F P=106> [Article by Wolfgang Mock - "With Its Call For a Build-up of </F>
the Fourth General Program for Research and Technology, the 
European Parliament is Headed on a Confrontation Course"] 
  [TEXT] 
<H3>  The Ministers for Research and Technology of the European 
Union are Facing Tough Negotiations. </H3>
  VDI-N, Bonn, 3 December 1993--Next Monday the European 
ministers for research and technology are meeting in Brussels. 
Their theme: the fourth General Program for Research and 
Technology for the European Union. There are not only 
difficulties in agreeing on content and financing. Now the 
European Parliament is also headed on a confrontation course and 
has called for an additional increase in money for research. 
  "We realize that we are on a confrontation course with our 
demands," Rolf Linkohr, the European parliamentarian, conceded, 
"but we cannot permit research in Europe to continue losing in 
importance." At Linkohr's suggestion, on the 18th of November 
the European Parliament called for 13.7 billion ECU (1 ECU = 
1.92 German marks) for the fourth General Program for Research 
and Technology starting in 1994, 600 million ECU more than 
planned. 
  Next Monday in Brussels the European ministers of research 
and technology will attempt to find an answer to this demand. 
But they already failed at their last meeting in mid-October to 
come to an agreement either on the content or the financing of 
this fourth General Program for Research and Technology for the 
European Union (EU). Nor is their success on Monday in any way a 
sure thing. "The chances," according to a colleague of Federal 
Minister for Research and Technology Paul Krueger, "are 
fifty-fifty." 
  Three different ideas must be reconciled in the formulation 
of the fourth General Program for Research and Technology: 


    -  The European Commission has requested 13.1 billion ECU 
calculated for the research and technology program from 1994 to 
1998. The largest blocks go to information and communications 
technologies (I&amp;C - 3,900 million ECU), industrial 
technologies 
(1,800 million ECU), life sciences (1,325 million ECU), energy 
technology (1,050 million ECU), fusion research (980 million 
ECU), and environmental research (970 million ECU). 
  -  The European Parliament had originally agreed to this 
proposal 
but then on the 18th of November demanded another 600 million 
ECU. Of this, 400 million ECU should be added to research on 
non-nuclear energy carriers. In addition, the industrial 
technologies were supposed to go up by 300 million ECU and 
I&amp;C 
technologies go down by 300 million ECU. Finally, the funds for 
the "socially oriented research" recently included in the fourth 
General Program for Research and Technology are also supposed to 
be increased from the previous 125 million ECU to 225 million. 
  -  The European ministers for research and technology 
responsible 
for the financing of this general program have until now 
approved neither of the Commission's or the Parliament's ideas 
on content nor financing. Even among themselves they are still 
far from agreeing on the content and financing (see VDI-N 22/93, 
p. 3.). 

    That is why this coming Monday the ministers for research 
and 
technology will try above all to determine the amount of the 
total budget. While the majority of the EU countries either 
agree with the Commission's proposal of 13.1 billion ECU or even 
call for more, Krueger considers this proposal overspending. 
With his colleagues in the Cabinet and the Minister of Finance 
Theo Waigel in tow, he will therefore try to keep the budget 
down to under 13 billion ECU. He has the influence to do it. 
After all, Bonn finances the Brussels budget and thus the fourth 
General Program for Research and Technology as well to a good 
30%. 
  However, Krueger can currently count only on the British for 
support with his demands. They had already indicated in October 
that they did not want to go over 11 billion ECU. Krueger and 
his British colleagues cannot not be outvoted--unanimity is a 
requirement for passing the program. 
  For tactical reasons, according to the Brussels research 
manager, the Council of Ministers may remain with its budget 
proposal well under the 13.1 billion ECU proposed by the 
Commission. That gives the ministers the necessary playing room 
in the poker game with the Parliament, since it has the final 
say in approval of the program. 
  EU parliamentarians like Linkohr are, however, not counting 
on the Parliament being able to push through its demands for 
another 600 million ECU. "But," as Linkohr says, "we won't 
consider anything less than 13.1 billion ECU."

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Bangemann: "Research Policies Play a Key </F>
Roll in Europe's Structural Industrial Change, yet they must be 
Supported by a Broad Section of the Public"] 
  [TEXT] 
  VDI-N, Brussels, 24 December 1993-The European Union 
wants to give greater encouragement to technological innovations 
which will make a viable contribution to strengthening Europe's 
competitiveness, according to EU Commissioner Martin Bangemann 
in his following article. 
  In recent years the European economy has lost a lot of 
ground 
in the technologies of the future. Japan's leadership in the 
high-tech sector seems almost unstoppable, and a similar lag in 
genetic and biotechnology compared with the USA is also taking 
shape. 
  While the European share of the world market in high 
technology was still around 25% in 1970, today it is less 
than 
20%. In contrast, during the same period of time, Japanese 
companies have increased their share from 15% to 
25%. It is 
therefore not astonishing that the number of Japanese patent 
registrations in the USA today is greater than those of all the 
countries of the European Union put together. Does this mean we 
are on our way to second class status in technology? 
  That is surely an exaggeration. European industry is still 
the world market leader in many areas, and no other industrial 
region has at its disposal such a highly developed industrial 
culture. But it cannot be overlooked that the trump cards of the 
past such as steel, automobiles, and chemistry are no longer, 
and new ones are not in sight. This leads to the question of 
where the new jobs will come from which are so urgently needed 
to compensate for the increasingly rapid dismantling of jobs in 
the old industries. 
  In this situation it is not enough just to appeal to 
European 
businesses and demand of them greater efforts in research to 
make European industry competitive. The most important thing is 
the creation of a climate favorable toward innovation, since 
throughout the European Union a whole series of complicated 
administrative and procedural provisions prevent private 
investments in the area of research. Therefore, it is completely 
understandable that increasingly more European firms are moving 
their research activities to countries where there are no such 
limitations. 
  There is a peculiar ambivalence in the public debate. On the 
one hand, the decline in jobs and growing unemployment are 
loudly lamented. On the other hand, technological innovations 
are resisted, and researchers are discouraged from translating 
the results of their work into competitive products. Those 
attitudes are not very compatible, but the political strength is 
lacking to expose the obvious contradictions and develop 
strategies which point to the future. Here we just talk too many 
things to death without thinking about the economic consequences. 
  We have to support technology and research policies in 
Europe 
more strongly than we have in the past. Our competitors on the 
world market are fully aware of the importance of federal 
policies on technology and research. While, for example, in 1991 
the total expenditure for research and development in the 
European Union was only 2.1% of the gross domestic product 
(GDP) of the EU, the USA and Japan spent around 2.8% and 
3.5% 
of their GDP to fund research and development. The amount of 
money spent is not in itself decisive in the results which are 
achieved. But it would be a mistake to deny any connection 
between investment capital and demonstrable success. 
  Therefore, with the Fourth General Program for Research and 
Technology we want first of all to strengthen the technological 
competency of the European economy. The continuing increase in 
the share of research expenditures within the Union's total 
budget indicates what importance we place on policies for 
research and technology--incidentally, in contrast to the member 
states which are more likely to be cutting back their research 
budgets as a whole. 
  There is a fateful tendency, especially in times of economic 
crisis, to use a great deal of money to support old industries 
which are no longer competitive. How many new jobs could have 
been created in recent years in Germany if the billions used for 
coal had been invested in research? Today this money is gone, 
without an end in sight to the coal subsidies--on the contrary. 
On 1 January 1994, the coal pfennig will actually be increased. 
An estimated 6.1 billion German marks will then be being spent 
just to preserve unprofitable German coal mining. We can 
certainly not improve the position of research in Germany in 
this way. 
  With the Fourth General Program we are gathering all the 
research efforts of the Union together in a single program, 
where we have to concentrate on fewer lines of research because 
of the relatively smaller share of our resources to all public 
research resources. This does not mean that we primarily want to 
support large individual projects as we did in the past. This 
action was not successful, as the example of the high-definition 
television shows. We are rather concentrating on supporting 
generic technologies. These are technologies which have an 
important overlapping effect on various branches of industry. So 
the first area of activity for implementing programs for 
research, technological development, and demonstration forms the 
main focus of the program. The total budget for this area is to 
be around 17 billion German marks, the 7.5 billion mark bulk of 
which will go to support new information and communications 
technologies, and 2.5 billion marks will go to support 
industrial technologies. 
  The Fourth General Program for Research and Technology 
carries through an important change in the paradigm. While, 
previously, individual technologies were specifically promoted, 
especially those from which large companies profited, the 
emphasis now is on technologies which overlap multiple fields. 
This requires a different sort of implementation. The goal is no 
longer to identify tomorrow's winner, which due to the 
increasingly greater market dynamics and the increasingly 
swifter decline of technological competence, is also no longer 
possible. The point is much more to encourage technological 
innovations which conform with pubic priorities, innovations 
which make an effective contribution to strengthening the 
competitiveness of European industry. 
  One important focus must lie in the development of 
environmentally sound products and production processes as well 
as of intelligent transportation and communications systems. 
There can be no doubt that these are important problems for the 
future whose solution will be of decisive significance for 
competitiveness. Until now we have just been lacking 
comprehensive technological approaches which link strategically 
important goals with appropriate technological means in the 
solution of problems. 
  Our research activity will continue to be concentrated on 
the 
economically pre-competitive stage. We thereby take into account 
the demand from trade and industry itself which wants to avoid a 
distorting effect on competition as much as possible through 
market-oriented research. Yet research may not limit itself to 
basic research if it is supposed to lead to quickly practical 
results. It must become by and large "closer to the market", 
since it is only with new products and new production processes 
which reach the market quickly that we can maintain the 
competitiveness of the European economy. We can no longer afford 
to be world leaders in basic research while leaving it to our 
competitors in the world market to bring the results of our 
research to the marketplace. We are only wasting our resources 
by doing this. 
  We first need stronger networking to develop new 
manufacturing processes or to deal with public tasks more 
efficiently with the most modern information technologies. The 
new conceptualization of our support for research thus 
fundamentally concerns the development of "networks of 
excellence" among industry, science, and end-users, so that more 
and more information in word, picture, and sound can be 
exchanged with ever increasing speed and accuracy. The common 
priorities for research must be determined in close dialog with 
business and industry and above all must contribute to the 
purposeful dissemination of the results of research. The small 
and mid-sized businesses in particular will also profit from 
this, companies which often do not have sufficient means at 
their disposal to participate directly in our research plans. 
Only in this way can we make a contribution to reducing 
structural unemployment. 
  European policies on research and technology are making an 
important contribution to the structural industrial change in 
the Union. They cannot, however, bring it about alone. It first 
depends on society's ability to make a systemic change. Still, 
modern policies on research and technology can contribute in 
substantial measure to keeping jobs which are endangered and 
recovering those already lost. However, it is decisive here that 
the goals of our policies are shared by the majority of our 
citizens. For this we need information and solutions which are 
free of taboos. That is the prime task of the state in a highly 
developed industrial society.

  [Text] Nine new special research areas will be established 
by the German Research Society (DFG) at the beginning of next 
year. Three of these projects will be assigned to biology and 
three to engineering; two pertain to the natural sciences and 
one to economics. Thus, from 1 January 1994, the DFG will be 
supporting 196 special research areas in 52 institutes of higher 
education. 
  "Signal recognition and transfer on cell surfaces" will be 
investigated by scientists at the Free University in Berlin, the 
Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, and the Institute 
for Plant Genetics and Cultured Plant Research in Gatersleben. 
This is intended to clarify the molecular basis of signal 
recognition on the surface of cells, their transmission into the 
interior of the cell and reactions stimulated in the process. 
Inflammations, differentiation among embryos and the development 
of tumors are closely linked with signal transmission. 
  Researchers at the two Munich universities and the Max 
Planck 
Institute for Biochemistry in the same city will investigate the 
"molecular and bioorganic basis for secondary metabolism." 
Secondary materials are considered to be those which are formed 
by plants or microorganisms but which are not absolutely 
necessary for their metabolism. They are characterized by 
complex structures and are often used in pharmacy. Using modern 
techniques it is hoped to shed light on their mechanisms and to 
produce new therapeutically effective substances. 
  Scientists from the Max Planck Institute and the university 
in Goettingen are participating in the third biological project 
along with the Brunswick Technical University and the Hannover 
Medical College. Their subject area, developmental biology, has 
had an explosive career over the last 10 years: It has been 
possible, using new techniques, to identify those genes which 
control the development of an organism out of an egg cell. Now 
the question is how the activity of the genes is regulated in a 
particular developmental program. Investigations in various 
animals ought to facilitate a general understanding of molecular 
strategies and blueprints in the animal kingdom. 
  Researchers from the Hamburg-Harburg Technical University 
and 
the GKSS Research Center in Geesthacht plan to concern 
themselves with an area of engineering which has been neglected 
in this country, the "micromechanics of multiphase materials." 
In view of the increasing need for innovative materials in 
industry, knowledge about the inner mechanism of materials is 
growing in importance. The behavior of metallic alloys, 
ceramics, or plastics must be known so that they can meet safety 
standards. 
  Two more special research areas in engineering have been 
assigned to the Aachen Technical College. Ergonomists, 
electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers will study 
"autonomous production cells." In the process systems should be 
developed which perform complex processes substantially 
independently and without interruption. Human beings should once 
again play an appropriate role in the factories of the future as 
"machine directors." 
  The heart of the "integrative material modeling" project is 
computer supported development of materials. Transcending the 
traditional classification of materials, the program ranges from 
the raw material to the finished components. The results will be 
important not only for basic research but also for business, 
since modeling is increasingly replacing expensive experiments 
in the production of components. 
  A third special research area is being set up in Aachen. 
This 
deals with "asymmetrical syntheses using chemical and biological 
methods." Too little attention has been paid to the fact that in 
chemical syntheses "chiral forms" arise as mirror images of a 
compound. These differ in their biological activity, e.g. in 
medications or plant protection. One of the forms is unnecessary 
or even dangerous. Thus techniques are being sought by which 
pure natural substances and hormones can be produced. 
  Scientists at Leipzig University will study "molecules in 
interaction with boundary surfaces." These surfaces control 
processes which are important in nature and technology and mark 
off functional spaces. Molecules change their characteristics 
when they come in contact with boundary surfaces and 
simultaneously have an effect on the behavior of the surfaces. 
The explication of fundamental relationships is important for 
new procedures in optoelectronics, sensorics, and informational 
technology, and also for medicine and environmental research. 
  Economists and mathematicians from the Humboldt University 
in 
Berlin will apply themselves to the "quantification and 
simulation of economic processes." In this study economic, 
mathematical, and statistical procedures are to be combined to 
evaluate the dynamics of economic processes.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  Measured in terms of domestic product, the U.S.A., Japan, 
and 
Germany spend about the same for research and development. The 
success is quite different. Referenced to the money spent, the 
Japanese register more patents than the Americans and the 
Americans more than the Germans. Using another indicator of 
success, the Nobel prizes for natural sciences, America is 
without peer. Then comes Germany while Japan has none. However, 
most of the Nobel prizes for Germans were awarded for research 
done in foreign countries and in foreign laboratories. 
Apparently, the Germans are good scientists but Germany does not 
provide them with enough development potential. 
  There is no international comparable data for the commercial 
success of R&amp;D expenditures. However, there is no doubt that 
Germany would be an also-ran. The reason for the low German 
research productivity is apparently poor organization. The 
famous Japanese MITI brings the companies together around one 
table to discuss a joint project. If the companies are ready to 
use their own money together, the MITI makes available a 
relatively modest government grant in addition. 
  In Germany and in the European Union, this is done 
differently. The government awards research and development 
contracts, some of which it finances completely--Jager 90, 
Transrapid, high-temperature reactor, space travel, fusion 
reactor, etc. If the contractor for a project that is fully 
financed by the government is a company and not a government 
research institute, the company has every reason to generate 
costs as high as possible because the contracts are usually 
awarded on a cost-plus basis. This means, the higher the costs, 
the higher the profit for the contractor. On the other hand, it 
makes virtually no difference to the company whether the 
development leads to a marketable product. The company is 
earning money on the research and need not recoup the costs of 
this research by way of sales. 
  Transrapid is a beautiful example of the results of this. 
The 
government-financed high-tech means of transport has been 
traveling around in circles for years as fast as lightning on a 
track in Emsland that is 31.5 kilometers long. Under the stilts 
of this track, contented cows graze. Unfortunately, no one has 
yet seen fit to buy this miracle of German engineering prowess. 
Therefore, in a second step, the sales are also to be financed 
by the government. The government wants to build a track from 
Hamburg to Berlin for 5.6 billion marks. A consortium of private 
companies will take over operation, again subsidized in the form 
of tax reductions. Because it is just the nature of government 
investment projects that, at the end, they are twice as 
expensive as originally estimated; the taxpayers will, when all 
is said and done, be asked to pay a few hundred marks per 
household. For this a reference track, which interested parties 
from the world over can view, will be available in the year 
2004. The test track in Emsland was apparently too short. 
  You can just imagine how the story continues. In 2005, a 
Russian delegation appears. They want to use the Transrapid on 
the line from Moscow to St. Petersburg. However, the Russians 
have no money. Consequently, the federal government ensures an 
interest-free, non-repayable loan because otherwise the contract 
would go to the Japanese. 
  Many such stories can be told. The Airbus received 
government 
financing but cannot be produced profitably without additional 
subsidies such as inexpensive loans and dollar exchange-rate 
guarantees. The Ariane is a reliable booster but a commercial 
flop. The Russians and even the Chinese are cheaper transporting 
payloads into space. The high-temperature reactor swallowed a 
large portion of the budget of the Federal Research Ministry for 
years. Not a single one has been sold and the only commercial 
reactor in Hamm-Uentrop has been shut down by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Land government--even though it was completely 
operational. The fast breeder reactor was even more expensive 
and just as unsuccessful. 
  Government support of microelectronics was a similar flop. 
Germany cannot defy Japan and the U.S.A. and cannot even keep up 
with South Korea anymore. Now, the government that has already 
paid for most of the research is also to subsidize production. 
You have not heard anything for two years about one of the most 
expensive projects, the fusion reactor. The government supported 
wind systems are, in the meantime, supplying a little power, but 
even then only because the electric power companies have been 
forced to purchase wind power at excessive prices. The goal of 
government research support is to provide innovative products 
that can be produced profitably in the high-salary country of 
Germany. The meaning is perverted if the production must also be 
subsidized. 
  The only reasonable strategy is to support research only 
where industry also assumes some risk with its own funds and 
therefore has an interest in marketable products. Then, the 
government need not care about the selection of projects any 
more. There was such a program in the form of salary subsidies 
for research plans of medium-sized companies. The program was 
overturned. That program could have produced something 
marketable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Bundespost Backs SES"] </F>
  [Text] Deutsche Bundespost Telekom has announced that it 
is to invest in Societe Europeenne des Satellites [SES] and form 
a joint company with SES to "promote the development of digital 
transmission technology in the areas of satellite and cable 
distribution for television and radio as well as for interactive 
services". The move, announced perhaps significantly on 27th 
December, when most European business was closed down, must come 
as a bitter blow to Eutelsat and its ambitions for Hot Bird 
Plus. As hinted at exclusively in Interspace last month, the 
mode involves one of Eutelsat's biggest and more progressive 
members backing its main rival. 
  The sums of money involved are not likely to be small; it is 
expected that the Bundespost will take more than 10 percent of 
SES's equity during the first quarter of this year. (However, 
it is not expected that it will have more than 10 percent of the 
voting rights.) SES will be expanding its equity base to 
accommodate the move and it looks as if the additional funding 
will be used as part of the financing for Astra 1f, a direct 
competitor to the digital Hot Bird Plus. 
  Moreover, the joint venture between SES and the Bundespost 
is 
likely to be set up in the first quarter of 1994 and will be 
used as a "development" arm to support manufacturers and 
broadcasters. 
  However, it is understood that Eutelsat's senior management 
are still looking at the implications of the Bundespost's 
planned investment and that there is a view at Eutelsat that it 
is not greatly significant for the future of the organisation. 
It is not the first time that such a move has happened; BT 
[British Telecom] during the late 1980s backed both SES and 
Eutelsat although no equity investment in SES was involved. It 
is believed that the Bundespost (currently the fourth largest 
user of Eutelsat) will continue to "support" the organisation. 
The SES move is seen as evidence that the Bundespost will not 
finance a second generation DFS Copernicus or TV-SAT 
replacement. 
  The Bundespost is also understood to be firmly behind the 
digital Hot Bird Plus project but the final decision of award of 
this contract (and hence its financing) is not due to be made 
until March of this year. 
  Nevertheless, the Bundespost is under financial pressure and 
it may yet become unwilling to finance a major part of the Astra 
system as well as Hot Bird Plus and Eutelsat III systems. The 
organisation will be faced with a massive investment in the next 
few years to convert its low capacity analogue cable networks to 
digital. This could cost between $3 billion and $10 billion. It 
is also believed that these cable operations are currently 
losing money heavily; some reports suggest as much as 500 
million a year. 
  An open question now is whether the Bundespost intends to 
"pool" its current satellite capacity (three DFS Copernicus FSS 
spacecraft and one TV-SAT BSS satellite) with that of SES, 
offering the latter the possibility of capacity for 
non-broadcast services. SES has been looking for some time at 
entering the telecommunications marketplace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France/Germany - France Telecom/DBT </F>
Announce Global Alliance"] 
  [Text] At a press conference held in Brussels on December 
7th, France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBT) 
confirmed recent speculation of a link-up between the two 
largest European operators when they announced a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) to create an ECU1 billion global strategic 
alliance. The two companies said the alliance was "the result 
of an in-depth dialogue, during which both operators have gained 
a new vision of their long-standing partnership in a 
fast-growing market." 
  According to the MoU signed by the two operators, each will 
hold equal shares of the new company, as yet unnamed. 
Initially, the joint venture will build from activities 
transferred from existing entities of the two carriers such as 
Transpac and its European subsidiaries, and Datex-P in Germany. 
Other France Telecom entities, including some units of France 
Cables et Radio, and DBT units as well as EUNETCOM, the France 
Telecom/DBT value-added services joint venture, will also be 
transferred to the joint company. 
  The company will provide services to multinational 
companies. 
These will include X.25 switched data, frame relay and Internet 
Protocol (IP) services, as well as virtual private data network 
services, international end-to-end digital circuits, VSAT 
[very-small-aperture terminal] services, international virtual 
private voice networks, and other voice value-added services. 
These services will use a single backbone network and have 
common network management systems. 
  The company is scheduled to become operational in early 1995 
when it will offer competitively-priced services, centralised 
billing, one-stop shopping, and global customer support. 
Products and services will be marketed under a joint brand name. 
  The new company will be headquartered in Brussels, with 
corporate offices and central operational units in France and 
Germany. 
  During its first year of operation, DBT and France Telecom 
expect the new venture to generate revenues of around ECU1.5 
billion and to have some 4,000 employees. 
  The two operators said they viewed the alliance as a "major 
undertaking to provide a range of competitive, innovative, 
high-value services on a worldwide basis," and said that "access 
to the North American and Asia-Pacific markets may be achieved 
through cooperation with other partners." Negotiations are 
believed to be ongoing with AT&amp;T of the United States. 
  Formal details of the new global alliance will now be 
examined by the European Commission which has yet to decide 
whether it falls under its jurisdiction. Most recently, the 
Commission said that it could not examine the proposed joint 
venture between BT and the United States operator, MCI, under 
its 1990 merger regulations because the deal was too small and 
instead would examine it under wider European anti-trust rules. 
  BT's Chairman, Iain Vallance, recently voiced his 
disapproval 
of the France Telecom/DBT merger. He believes that effective 
liberalisation and a regulatory regime which encourages European 
companies to develop new technologies to the best advantage can 
best be accelerated by a total freedom to compete for 
telecommunications services and customers across Europe and is 
dismayed that implementation of a European Commission directive 
insisting on full telecommunications liberalisation has been 
delayed until 1998, with exclusion clauses for some countries. 
  It is in this context that he disapproves of the prospect of 
the merger of DBT's and France Telecom's operations. If such a 
merger was allowed to take place before the full liberalisation 
across Europe, then it would simply constitute a firmly 
entrenched pan-European telecommunications monopoly that is 
totally at odds with the European vision of open competition in 
a single market, he said. 
  Announcing the alliance, the two operators said that all the 
activities of the new company are in sectors fully opened to 
competition and not subject to monopoly control. Furthermore, 
these activities will be pursued in total conformity with the 
rules of competition defined by the European Commission. They 
added that the arrangements would not compromise any existing 
bilateral correspondent agreements already established with all 
other international carriers. 
  DBT and France Telecom hope to receive EC Commission 
approval 
for the merger before the end of March next year. 
  Prior to the announcement confirming the alliance, the 
German 
Postal Minister, Wolfgang Boetsch, and Industry Minister Gerard 
Longuet of France, welcomed the European operator's plans and 
said that they did not infringe upon European competition rules. 
  In a statement, the German Postal Ministry said: "The plans 
should be seen against the backdrop of an alliance and 
partnership which could lead to a capital swap as soon as the 
legal status of the two firms allows it." 
  A date for the privatisation of France Telecom has not yet 
been decided, while the privatisation of DBT is scheduled to 
begin in 1995. 
  Announcement of the alliance came as European ministers were 
meeting in Brussels to discuss the European Commission's 
proposals for the liberalisation of the European 
telecommunications sector.

<F P=106> [Article: "ASEA Takes Over Renault Robotics Operations"] </F>
  [Text] Its marriage with Sweden's beautiful Volvo has not 
even taken place yet, but Renault is already making eyes at the 
other Swedish beauty, ASEA [Swedish General Electric 
Corporation], which is going to take over its robotics 
operations and set up a joint venture. Renault Automation's 
robotics branch (ACMA, employing 350 and accounting for from 10 
to 12 percent of Renault's turnover, which totaled 1.4 billion 
francs in 1992) is the leader in the French industrial robot 
market, but until now it has had only limited access to the 
international market. Its integration with ABB Robotics, the 
world leader, which had a turnover of $450 million (2.6 billion 
francs) in 1993 and faces such heavyweight competitors as 
Japan's Fanuc, Yaskawa, Matsushita, and Kawasaki, will enable 
the Swiss-Swedish group to strengthen its presence in the French 
market, notably by increasing its turnover fourfold to 360 
million francs. The purpose of the joint venture, whose owners 
will be equal partners, will be to develop activities in the 
area of auto body assembly systems so as to offer turnkey 
automatic systems to automobile manufacturers and other 
industrial sectors. That market is growing steadily, and Stelio 
Demark, president of ABB Robotics, estimates that it is worth 
some $1 billion (about 6 billion francs). The agreement will put 
the Swedish group in a position to reach all of Renault's 
customers and some of Peugeot's as well. Although Renault will 
continue to manage their joint venture -- which has now shifted 
its attention to special machine tools, automated assembly 
operations, and machining (in Castres) -- for at least two 
years, it is a good bet that the powerful Swedish electrical 
engineering firm will not stop there. All of Renault Automation 
is likely to become Swedish, and Volvo, which is already one of 
the ABB's biggest customers, might help expand that cooperation. 
Getting rid of Renault's automatic controls subsidiary with its 
chaotic operating results has long been the French 
manufacturer's express wish. Selling Renault Automation piece by 
piece began with the sale of the April programmable robots to 
Merlin Gerin. Then it was the turn of industrial engineering, 
which was taken over by Dynatech. Lastly, a subsidiary of the 
Italian group Elsag Bailey--the DEA [San Giorgio Electronics 
Company-Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry]--bought 
the measurements branch last year. Renault then tried to reach 
an agreement to sell the robotics branch, whose turnover had 
dropped by almost half in two years' time (170 million francs in 
1992), to Comau, a Fiat subsidiary. ABB Robotics, whose sales on 
the French market totaled 119 million francs in 1992, has long 
supplied automobile production lines with manipulator arms and 
other electronic controls. The result is that automobile 
manufacturers have long been its natural allies, and it is very 
dependent on them. The decline in investments in the automotive 
industry as a whole is making itself felt in the world robotics 
market, which is deteriorating steadily even in Southeast Asia, 
where the ABB already faces strong Japanese competitors.

<F P=106> [Article: "Dassault Systems Announces CAA Development </F>
Agreement With Australia's Moldflow"] 
  [Text] Moldflow and Dassault Systems have announced their 
CAA (CATIA [Computer-Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive 
Applications] Application Architecture) development agreement. 
The two companies will integrate their engineering design and 
analysis products so as to offer CATIA users a complete analysis 
system for injection-formed plastic parts. The interface between 
CATIA and Moldflow makes it possible to analyze the flow of 
material during the injection and cooling of the part, monitor 
surface effects and weld lines, check shrinkage, and so on. The 
part is designed and meshed by CATIA before being subjected to 
Moldflow's specialized problem solvers. The analysis results are 
then displayed using CATIA's postprocessor. The development 
agreement provides the first solution for analyzing and 
simulating plastic injection in complete integration with CATIA, 
according to Francis Bernard, general manager of Dassault 
Systems. It also makes it possible to "optimize the design of 
injected plastic parts by simplifying the design process and 
reducing analysis times." Moldflow Proprietary, Ltd., 
established in 1978 and now the world leader in the plastics 
analysis market, develops and markets computer-aided engineering 
software specifically for the molded-plastics injection market. 
That technology, consisting of a combination of software and 
design concepts, has literally revolutionized the design of 
parts and moldings all over the world. The firm's headquarters 
are in Melbourne, Australia, with subsidiaries in Great Britain, 
Germany, Korea, China, and the United States employing about 100 
people.

[European Satellite Company] Cooperation on Digital 
Transmissions Via Satellite"] 
  [Text] Paris--Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBP Telekom) and 
SES, which operates the Astra satellites, will create a joint 
company to develop the digital transmission of TV and radio 
programs via satellite and cable, the SES announced on 27 
December. 
  In addition, DTB [Digital Television Broadcasting] will 
acquire an interest in SES "within the next three to four 
weeks," the objective being for DBP Telekom to eventually hold 
"15 or 16 percent" of the Luxembourg company capital, people at 
the SES head office in Betzdorf (near Luxembourg) indicated. 
  Luxembourg will remain the largest shareholder, through two 
public companies, the State Savings Bank and the National Credit 
and Investment Company, each retaining one third of the voting 
rights. The future company "will promote the development of 
digital satellite and cable transmission techniques for TV and 
radio programs and interactive services." 
  The SES intends to use digital compression on its two future 
satellites, Astra-1E and Astra-1S, to be launched at the 
beginning of 1995 and 1996 respectively. With 40 repeaters each, 
these two satellites will broadcast up to 400 TV programs. This 
range of new services will enable consumers to pay only for what 
they choose, or even to place orders directly by telephone 
through a modem.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Ericsson Expected to Double 1992 </F>
Sales"] 
  [Text] Ericsson reported pre-tax earnings of 569 million 
Swedish Kronor [SKr] for the third quarter of this year, 
representing a nine-fold increase on 1992's third quarter 
earnings of SKr63 million. For the nine months to the end of 
September 1993, pre-tax income reached SKr1,855 million, more 
than 15 times the Skr122 million recorded in the comparable 1992 
period. 
  The net result was a SKr347 million profit for the third 
quarter of this year compared with a loss of SKr205 million in 
1992. In the January to September 1993 period, net income was 
SKr928 million versus last year's SKr9 million. 
  Net sales rose 54.7 percent to SKr15,021 million in the 
quarter and 41.3 percent to SKr42,415 million in the nine-month 
period. Order bookings in the January to September 1993 period 
totalled SKr49,210 million which was SKr11,483 million more than 
the amount of orders booked in the same period in 1992. 1993's 
sales and order bookings were boosted by a decline in the 
exchange rate for the Swedish kronor and, if this was taken into 
account, Ericsson noted that the increase in net sales was 20 
percent and the order bookings increase about 10 percent. 
  The United States is currently Ericsson's largest market, 
measured in net sales, followed by Italy, Sweden, and the United 
Kingdom. Over the past year, China's share of net sales has 
risen from three to six percent, which makes this country 
Ericsson's fifth largest market. 
  "Radio communications" is the product area showing the 
strongest growth and is now the largest of Ericsson's business 
areas, both in terms of order bookings and net sales. The sharp 
increase in net sales within this product group was mainly 
attributable to sales of mobile phone systems and mobile phones. 
Notable among the most expansive markets were China, Germany, 
and Australia. Order bookings also rose sharply, with large 
orders reported in China, the United States, Mexico, Germany, 
and Australia. 
  "Public telecommunications" reported third quarter and 
nine-month sales increases of 17.2 per cent and 15.6 percent, 
respectively, despite the divestment of the former operator 
activity in Argentina and the transfer of telecommunications 
exchanges for mobile telephone system to "radio communications" 
which took effect in January 1993. The increases were mainly 
attributable to Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, and Malaysia. 
Order bookings rose most in China, Spain, Australia, and 
Thailand. Important orders were also signed in Saudi Arabia and 
Lebanon. Ericsson's new switches for broadband transmission 
based on ATM [asynchronous transfer mode] technology have been 
ordered in Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Italy. SDH [synchronous 
digital hierarchy] for digital signal transfer has been ordered 
in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. 
  "Business networks" reported strong increases in net sales 
and order bookings. This was mainly due to the consolidation of 
the Austrian company, Schrack. Major order bookings were 
recorded in Spain, Argentina, and the Philippines. 
  "Components" showed an increase in net sales following a 
number of deliveries of power equipment to markets in Germany, 
Spain, and the Far East. 
  The increase in net sales for "defense systems" was only 
marginally affected by currency rate changes, since most of the 
customers are based in Sweden. Order bookings were slightly 
lower than during the corresponding period in 1992 due to last 
year's substantial JAS orders.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense: GEC Renounces Ferranti </F>
Takeover"] 
  [Text] GEC has just renounced its takeover bid on the 
British defense electronics specialist saying that an 
examination of Ferranti's books had revealed a much worse 
financial situation than anticipated. GEC had offered one penny 
per share, or 10.1 million pounds (some 90 million French 
francs) in addition to taking over the Ferranti's debts, 
estimated at 140 million pounds. 
  Following GEC's withdrawal, Ferranti has been put into 
receivership. The receiver will try to sell off the company's 
assets in an attempt to pay off creditors. Operations may be 
sold off one by one, which would enable GEC or others to take 
over only the most attractive activities (for example, the sonar 
operation managed through a joint company with Thomson-CSF) 
without Ferranti's debts. During the first quarter of the 
fiscal year, Ferranti recorded a loss of 19.4 million pounds for 
revenues which fell by 17 percent to 91 million pounds and an 
order book worth 165 million pounds. GEC, for its part, has 
just concluded its first quarter with a 2.9 percent increase in 
revenues (4.38 billion pounds) and pretax profits totaling 360 
million pounds.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "Fiar Overcomes the Crisis in </F>
the Sector with Increased Foreign Orders"] 
  [Text] The strong contraction in military aircraft sales 
that is being felt all over the world has pushed Fiar (a 
Milan-based company of the Finmeccania group) to explore the new 
market of upgrading electronic equipment aboard fighter aircraft 
in the sector. This is a decision that the Italian company made 
about 10 years ago when the first signs of difficulties were 
being felt in the defense industry. This field is characterized 
by extremely long design schedules and full aircraft operations: 
it may take up to 10 years from the date the program is 
launched to the date of installation on a jet. And the 
never-ending Eurofighter 2000 story is a wide confirmation of 
this fact. Therefore Fiar, anticipating the current market 
crisis, decided to invest in the avionic radar sector to upgrade 
a vast family of jets thereby lengthening the operational life 
of aircraft in an area (that of electronics) that characterizes 
a fighter aircraft, allowing it to compete almost on a par with 
more modern, but certainly more expensive machines. By pursuing 
and achieving this objective, Fiar ranks as one of the very few 
leading companies in this sector worldwide. Within the next 10 
years these companies will share an international market 
currently estimated to be worth 15 trillion lire. The most 
recent Fiar success dates to a few weeks ago when Pakistan 
assigned the Milan-based company a 90-billion-lire order to 
upgrade the radars installed on its F7 fighter aircraft (the 
Chinese version of the MIG-21) with another 50-billion-lire 
option. And once again with Pakistan, Fiar is negotiating a new 
order to upgrade the Mirage line. However the electronic 
company marketing division is also negotiating interesting 
contracts with other countries in South-East Asia for the sale 
of a radar that derives from the Grifo model, also suitable for 
the U.S. Northrop F-5 fighter aircraft. Last year 76 percent of 
Fiar's orders came from overseas markets. This figure has 
permitted the company to cover a large part of the gap that 
comes from the national market whose budget is at survival 
levels following the constant cuts made by the last government 
budgets to the item on the upgrading of the Italian Air Force. 
This is a painful area for Italian companies, which have seen 
the third phase (of the six scheduled) of the order for the new 
AMX fighter-bomber aircraft (Alenia, Aermacchi, Embraer) 
stopped, without giving any go-ahead on the program to upgrade 
the jet with the Grifo X Plus radar. 
  Fiar is currently developing the ECR90 radar for the 
Eurofighter 2000 with the British company GEC Marconi Avionics, 
DARA [German Aerospace Agency] of Germany, and Insiel of Spain, 
with a 26 percent share. Moreover since June 1992 Fiar has 
been the leading contractor in an order for the development of 
the Pirate infrared system (once again for the new European 
fighter). It is an extremely advanced piece of electro-optical 
equipment which, thanks to a particular data and signal 
processing capacity, can operate either as a fighter radar or in 
an entirely passive way, that is, without emitting radiation 
that can be detected by enemy sensors, in addition to allowing 
pilots to fly in the most absolute obscurity without the aid of 
any external reference points. And in the final stage of this 
program Fiar will develop a system that will send the images 
from the infrared system to a visor on the pilot's helmet and 
present television-quality images of the scene scanned by Pirate 
directly in front of his eyes. These programs, combined with 
others such as those for space equipment and new sonars for the 
navy, enabled Fiar to achieve 225.5 billion lire in revenues 
last year with a 344.5-billion-lire portfolio of orders and 57 
billion lire allocated for research and development. Even this 
year, business should reach 1992 levels, but with a stronger 
share of foreign orders.

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Salvatori: "Olivetti's Challenge Begins </F>
With OTM"] 
  [Excerpts] The news of the creation of Olivetti Telecom 
and Multimedia (OTM) is very important. It could change the 
future of Olivetti over the coming years and partially 
contribute to resolving the serious employment problem that is 
currently affecting the Ivrea-based company. For the time being 
talks with the trade unions concerning surplus employees have 
been suspended. According to recent unconfirmed statements this 
surplus is estimated to be 2,000 people. The attention now 
moves to what the Ivrea management is doing to give the general 
development trends for the immediate future. Olivetti like all 
the other major and medium-sized companies in the computer 
sector is currently experiencing a crisis. 
  [passage omitted] How is it possible to get out of this 
situation which appears to be one of no return. There are many 
answers: widening the consumer market, moving toward software, 
increasing consulting services, increasing services... One of 
the winning routes is surely that of integrating the computer 
and telecommunications sectors. 
  Today, TV, computers, and consumer electronics converge at a 
single point: the possibility of providing each of us with the 
information he needs (Stock Exchange quotations, soccer results, 
telephone conversations, client databases etc.) wherever we find 
ourselves and wherever there are archives containing this 
information. For the computer world combining computers with 
telecommunications is not an extra opportunity: it is the 
opportunity. 
  For this reason the formation of Olivetti Telecom and 
Multimedia is strategic: It is a real sign that Ivrea is well 
aware that this marriage cannot be avoided. 
  OTM is divided into four operational areas supervised by 
Olivetti Vice President Elserino Piol and led by Francesco Caio, 
formerly De Benedetti's assistant and director of company 
projects. The first area, Omnitel, is dedicated to mobile 
telephony. Omintel is the consortium led by Olivetti which is 
candidating itself to manage the European GSM mobile telephone 
system, a 1.5 trillion-lire business that could employ more than 
2,000 people and which the trade union has paid a great deal of 
attention to over recent days. 
  The second area, Telecommunications Systems, comprises 
companies that have been operating in the data transmission 
networks and payment systems fields for years now: Sixtel and 
Sixcom. The Cambridge laboratories fall under this area, it is 
an extremely dynamic task force that in one way or another has 
been behind all of Olivetti's announcements in the 
telecommunications sector. 
  The third area, that of telecommunications services, 
includes 
Seva, which offers value-added services, and the Geonet network, 
a property network that can represent the basic infrastructure 
for the supply of outsourcing services to clients. The last 
area includes the Radiocor press agency and the newborn Opera 
Multimedia for CD-ROM development.

<F P=106> [Article signed O.P.: "300-Million-Franc Loss for </F>
Eurocopter in 1993"] 
  [Text] Eurocopter CEO Jean-Francois Bigay is at a 
crossroads. The Franco-German company (Aerospatiale: 70 percent; 
Deutsche Aerospace: 30 percent) has just been through a 1993 
fiscal year which would have been disastrous but for two 
last-minute military contracts with Turkey and the Netherlands. 
And Mr. Bigay opens the 1994 year with license agreements and 
an order for five Dauphin helicopters from Samsung Aerospace, 
hoping he will not have to implement a new streamlining plan. 
  In financial terms the helicopter manufacturer went into the 
red last year for the first time ever. The exact amount of the 
losses will not be known until April, but it should be close to 
300 million French francs [Fr], including Fr250 million in 
depreciations and specific risk allowances. In 1992, Eurocopter 
earned Fr25 million. Its objective for 1994 is clearly to 
restore its financial balance. However, it will not be able to 
prevent sales from falling further this year. Sales amounted to 
Fr10.2 billion in 1993, a 10.5 percent decline. Another 
Fr800-million drop is expected this year, with sales falling 
below the Fr9.5 billion mark. Mr. Bigay's explanation is that 
"the world market for helicopters last year was the worst in 25 
years, with 260 civilian and 285 military machines (not 
including two closed markets -- the U.S. and Russian armed 
forces). Such a low level of orders had not been witnessed 
since the mid-1960s, with the exception -- on the military side 
-- of the year 1991, weighted down by the Gulf War. 
<H5>  Slight Reprieve </H5>
  The Franco-German company did manage to capture 56 percent 
of 
the civilian market and to regain its average defense share (24 
percent). Its order book totaled Fr9.3 billion and 166 
helicopters, including 43 large ones. Ninety-five percent of 
orders come from abroad, with, among others, 20 Cougars for 
Turkey and 17 military Super Pumas for the Netherlands -- a 
Fr1.4-billion contract. Thus Bonn and Paris will have only made 
a very limited contribution to the company's health. 
  Still, although the recent contracts will guarantee some 
activity for 1994 and part of 1995, Eurocopter badly needs 
another large order this year -- about 20 Super Pumas worth 
Fr1.5 billion. The company is therefore hoping that France and 
Germany will agree to give it a hand should foreign orders fail 
to materialize in 1994. Indeed, it was only in the hypothesis 
that another large order was on the way that Eurocopter decided 
not to suppress more jobs, as it did in 1993 for 1,060 
positions, cutting its total workforce down to 10,500. The 
Franco-German company would rather resort to short-term measures 
only, such as temporary unemployment; a gamble which it may need 
to reconsider in the second half of 1994 should market 
conditions keep deteriorating.

<F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Collet: "Saudia Airlines: The Wings </F>
of Desire"] 
  [Text] After Jedda and Abu Dhabi, and before returning to 
Paris, [Industry, Foreign Trade, and Telecommunications 
Minister] Gerard Longuet stopped off at the Dubai aeronautics 
salon, the third gathering since its creation in 1989. This was 
a particularly timely visit since a number of contracts, civil 
and military, are now on their approach run. 
  The "jumbo contract" will be for the partial renewal of the 
Saudia Airlines fleet, representing some 40 aircraft and worth 
in the region of 20 billion French francs. 
  The Airbus-Boeing race to win the contract will be ruthless. 
After Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and President Mitterrand, and 
before Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, it was Gerard Longuet's 
turn to discuss the deal with Saudi officials. For the 
Americans, President Bill Clinton personally telephoned King 
Fahd to inform him of the importance he attaches to this 
contract. It is true that Boeing, which has had to concede 70 
percent of the market in this region to the Europeans from 
Airbus Industrie, is determined to catch up again. This is all 
the more true since the potential airliner market in the Middle 
East could be worth in the region of $28 billion between now and 
2010. 
  Between 7 and 10 November, the 48 French companies present 
in 
Dubai, out of a total of 450, noticed that competition was 
increasingly severe, with the arrival of newcomers like South 
Africa and Romania. 
  Serge Dassault, president and managing director of Dassault 
Aviation [DASA] and chairman of the French GIFAS [French 
Aerospace Industries Grouping], took the opportunity to 
reiterate that "unlike the United States, we are not opposed to 
the transfer of any of our technology." 
  French manufacturers are ready to take off in the military 
market. Dassault Aviation hopes to sell Mirage 2000's, and in 
the longer term, Mirage 2000-5's, which Taiwan has expressed an 
interest in purchasing. 
  Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and DASA, which has 
already sold 190 helicopters in the Gulf, would like to sell 
some fifteen Panthers to the United Arab Emirates, to compete 
with the British Lynx. The Cougar is also being offered to 
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in competition with the American 
Blackhawk. 
  Lastly, Matra has sold the Mistral missile to Saudi Arabia, 
the Emirates, and Qatar. The company, headed by Jean-Luc 
Lagardere, is in the final stage of negotiations with Kuwait and 
Oman. 
  The coming year 1994 will reveal whether or not France has 
found takers for a share of this arsenal.

  [Text] At a cost of billions of German marks, Siemens AG, 
Berlin/Munich, intends starting chip production in Dresden. A 
new semiconductor factory for computer memories and logic 
circuits will be set up in the Saxon capital, probably employing 
1,200 people. A group spokesman confirmed that major 
investments are planned in microelectronics. But the details 
will not be announced until Federal Research Minister Paul 
Krueger is in Dresden on 23 December. 
  The construction of a microchip factory in Dresden was 
already under discussion about two years ago. When Siemens was 
looking at various possible sites to build such a factory, the 
then Federal Trade and Industry Minister Juergen W. Moellemann 
came out strongly in favour of the Saxon capital. But at the 
same time he refused "special financial support" for the 
project. As Siemens market researchers came to the view that 
sales of memory chips would decrease significantly over the next 
few years (because of their greater capacity), the Semiconductor 
Division was grappling with enormous losses, and the subsidy 
offered was not what the group expected, at the time Siemens put 
the project on hold. 
  Now a decision has evidently been made. According to a 
report in the magazine "BILD", a chip factory costing one 
billion German marks [DM] will be built in Dresden with a DM300 
million government subsidy. It was further reported that DM2.4 
billion will be invested at the Saxon location over the next 10 
years. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology will 
grant as much as DM30 million a year in subsidies to specific 
research projects at the factory under the budget heading 
"Microelectronics Research and Development." Siemens could, of 
course, also claim the normal investment subsidies available in 
eastern Germany. 
  The factory, to be built on a site close to Dresden airport, 
is initially intended for dynamic memory chips (the so-called 
DRAM [dynamic random access memory] semiconductors), but will 
later also make logic circuits, in particular customer and 
application-specific chips (ASIC [application-specific 
integrated circuits]). The memories will, so to speak, secure 
the necessary basic quantities of work, on which ASIC 
manufacture can then be built up. When completed, the factory 
will probably employ 1,200 people, 100 of them in the 
laboratory. The same number of jobs will be secured or created 
with future suppliers. 
  Siemens is understood to be seeking additional industrial 
partners for the new works. It will cooperate with the Dresden 
Microelectronics Center (ZMD), in which the Commerzbank AG and 
the Dresdner Bank AG, both of Frankfurt, have a holding, and 
which Siemens is already providing know-how, managerial staff, 
and orders. There is also the possibility of cooperation with a 
Fraunhofer Institute that developed out of the ZND's precursor 
company. Microelectronics could thus again become one of 
Dresden's major industries. 
  How far Siemens' proposed involvement in Saxony denotes a 
change in company policy in the semiconductor sector remains to 
be seen. Dresden is likely to make the 16 and 64 megabit memory 
chips. Under earlier plans, the former was to have been built 
with U.S. computer giant IBM in France. A new factory was not 
previously planned for the 64 megabit chip either. Instead, 
existing manufacturing plants were to have been adapted 
accordingly. But it seems that the chip boom that has resumed 
in the meantime has led to a rethink.

<F P=106> [Interview with SGS-Thomson Chief Executive Officer Pasquale </F>
Pistorio by Marc Nexon; place, date not given: "SGS-Thomson 
Equipped To Take on The Competition"] 
  [Text] 
  [Nexon] How do you see the situation of SGS-Thomson? 
  [Pistorio] Today we have the answer to the question that was 
being asked seven years ago about the survival of the company: 
SGS-Thomson has managed to recover and has become a 
structurally-sound group. Debt has been reduced to less than 
$300 million from the $900 million of two years ago. Cash flow 
has been positive for two years now. On the technological 
front, today we have some undeniable advantages. At Crolles, 
near Grenoble, we have a plant the likes of which few groups in 
the world can pride themselves on. 
  In 1993 we moved into the world's top three producers of 
EPROM [erasable programmable read-only memory], one of our 
specialist products. We are also a world leader in mixed and 
power technologies. You may not know, for example, that last 
year SGS-Thomson filed 327 patents -- one-third of the number 
filed by IBM and almost twice as many as were filed by the whole 
of the German microelectronics industry. That should be 
stressed. However, that does not mean we can now rest on our 
laurels. 
  [Nexon] What ambitions do you have for SGS-Thomson? 
  [Pistorio] The group must continue to grow faster than the 
market. If we want to hold five percent of the world 
semiconductor market at the end of the decade (currently we have 
2.7 percent), then we need to increase SGS-Thomson's revenues by 
a factor of four. This is a major challenge, but one that we can 
meet. I am committed to making SGS-Thomson one of the 10 world 
leaders in this area within two years. On condition, of course, 
that we do not drop our guard. 
  [Nexon] What if there is another downturn in the market, as 
people are predicting, in two years' time? 
  [Pistorio] SGS-Thomson now has the means of remaining 
profitable. Even if the components market falls, we will remain 
positive. Our aim now is to increase our profitability over the 
average for the microelectronics industry. In 1994 our profits 
will, in principle, be better if the favorable trend continues. 
If, on the other hand, the market takes a downturn in the 
second half, the situation will be different. 
  [Nexon] Do you intend competing with Intel in 
microprocessors 
and with the Japanese in dynamic memory (DRAM)? 
  [Pistorio] We are currently involved in the microprocessor 
business, but it is true that we are not active on the mass 
microcomputing market. We are currently seriously considering 
this option. We will make our final decision in the next few 
months. We do not want to rush into things because we are 
talking about a long-term strategy. To enter this market we 
could broaden our alliance with the American manufacturer Cyrix. 
Where dynamic memory is concerned, the answer is clearly no. 
There are too many competitors, and there is even competition 
in Europe. It is a vast market but it is not a strategic one 
today. It is possible to obtain a high level of technological 
know-how without gaining expertise in this type of component. 
  [Nexon] It is rumored that your public shareholders in Italy 
want to pull out... 
  [Pistorio] There is nothing that makes me think our Italian 
partners want to pull out. On the contrary, they should find 
the company's results rather reassuring. 
  [Nexon] So there are no new partners on the horizon, for 
example Texas Instruments or Motorola? 
  [Pistorio] None. Any conjecture about transferring a share 
of our capital to the Americans is quite unfounded. 
  [Nexon] Are you still assured of receiving the remaining 
$500 
million for your recapitalization now you have returned to 
profit? 
  [Pistorio] That is a decision for the shareholders, but I am 
confident. It is precisely because they felt the full potential 
of the company that they released an initial slice of $500 
million. Indeed, the performance of SGS-Thomson justifies new 
investment. In any event, to maintain accelerated growth we 
will need external financing. 
  [Nexon] People are also talking about a possible flotation 
on 
the Paris stock exchange... 
  [Pistorio] Our expansion and our profitability mean that we 
are going to need capital. The group's situation is likely to 
encourage investors. Today the conditions have come together in 
such a way that we can start to think about a flotation. 
Personally, I am in favor. I have made my views known to my 
shareholders, but it is they who will decide. 
  [Nexon] What about the $1 billion contribution promised by 
the French and Italian governments for R&amp;D? 
  [Pistorio] The public authorities are giving positive signs 
about their desire to maintain the R&amp;D effort. The actual sum 
will depend on the different projects put forward. We have to 
remember that this aid will on average finance one-third of the 
cost of the R&amp;D for the group's main technological projects 
approved by the pubic authorities. 
  [Nexon] Can we expect to see a major European alliance for 
components, in particular with Siemens? 
  [Pistorio] We are open to all cooperation agreements. 
Moreover, we are working with Siemens in the context of the 
European research program JESSI [Joint European Submicron 
Silicon Initiative]. However, we should remember that our 
respective strategic interests are different, especially since 
we decided not to venture into the area of flash memory. 
Siemens has just made a large investment in Dresden (former 
East Germany), but we are not interested in participating. For 
our part, we are involved in a major R&amp;D cooperation project 
in 
Crolles with Philips and the CNET (France Telecom). Managing 
such a program with three partners that big already requires a 
lot of work. For the time being, our agreements with Siemens 
remain on a case-by-case basis. The defense of the European 
electronics industry does not necessarily come through 
partnership deals. 
  [Nexon] How is your industrial restructuring program going? 
  [Pistorio] It is complete. Five years ago we had 22 
factories. Today we have just 15 sites. However, we have a 
great need for new capacity. If we had had it last year, our 
revenues would probably have been up by 50 percent instead of by 
30 percent. As a result, we will be deciding on fresh 
investment in the next six months. This year we must are to 
start building a new assembly plant in Asia, probably in China. 
Demand is burgeoning on the Chinese market. We will therefore 
also need to build at least two more distribution plants 
(modules) in the next five years, including one in the United 
States. Nor must we forget our investments at Crolles. Some 
$250 million has been invested so far, and an additional $150 
million is currently being assigned. By the end of next year, a 
total of $600 million will have been invested on this site. 
  [Nexon] In which zones do you want to build up your 
presence? 
  [Pistorio] In 1993 our sales outside of Europe topped 50 
percent of revenues for the first time ever. However, that is 
still not enough. Our aim is to reach 65 percent by the end of 
the decade by strengthening our position in the United States 
and Asia, where demand is very high. We generate $650 million 
in revenues with American customers. We hope this year to top 
the $1 billion mark. Our presence in Asia will also be 
strengthened through the development of our activities in Japan. 
Staff numbers should quickly rise to around a hundred. 
  [Nexon] Seven years after the merger, would you say that 
SGS-Thomson is now out of trouble? 
  [Pistorio] Absolutely. The company now has considerable 
resources including on the human level. Last year we took on 
850 people in France and Italy, and we are continuing to recruit 
this year. The group is now capable of reacting quickly and of 
adapting to changes in the market while preserving its culture 
and warmth. 
<H5>  Pasquale Pistorio </H5>
  "I still have some fifty or so years ahead of me," jokes 
this 
58-year old Sicilian. At the controls of the French-Italian 
manufacturer for seven years now, this rotund and friendly man 
who despairs of ever finding a winning diet, does not intend 
hanging up his boots just yet. "He is boiling over with ideas 
for his group," a government representative said of him. His 
latest hobby horse is ecology. "SGS-Thomson must be the first 
company to eliminate CFC's from its products from 1996," he 
insists. Over the years, Pasquale Pistorio has won the respect 
of his shareholders. In his view, the European electronics 
industry deserves to be fought for, all the more so since "the 
Japanese have definitively lost their market leadership to the 
Americans."

  Preface 
  The Research Centre Julich (KFA) is a multidisciplinary 
research institution dealing with a broad range of topics and 
research activities of particular interest for the public. Its 
five research priorities structures of matter/materials 
research, energy technology, information technology, 
environmental precaution research and life sciences contribute 
to basic research and long-term programmes as well as to 
precaution research and key technologies. Interdisciplinary 
cooperation through and beyond the boundaries of specific areas 
of research is the basic concept pursued at the Research Centre 
Julich. Nevertheless, the KFA is not isolated, but maintains 
close cooperation with universities, other non-university 
research laboratories and industry, e.g., in the form of 
collaborative programmes. 
  This annual report is intended to present the various 
research activities of the Research Centre Julich to the public 
at large. A major portion of the report consists of popularized 
contributions based on work in the five main areas of research. 
Of course, they only highlight individual aspects of research, 
but they also illustrate the efficiency of cooperation beyond 
institute and division boundaries and demonstrate how concrete 
applications are derived from application-oriented basic 
research. 
  Interdisciplinary cooperation is indispensable especially in 
environmental research in order to explain the complicated 
interrelations prevailing there. Examples presented in this 
connection are the "Interactions between Biosphere and 
Atmosphere" and "Larix sibirica--an Archive of Climate 
Research." Progress in state-of-the-art medicine, specifically 
in medical diagnostics, is not conceivable either without 
cooperation between physicians, scientists and engineers, as is 
shown by the example "Tomographic Methods." The "Career of an 
Enzyme: From Analytic Reagent to Technical Catalyst" illustrates 
that life sciences also include industrial and product research. 
Further progress in information technology requires basic 
research over many years. Components can only be further 
improved and miniaturized today if the underlying structures are 
precisely characterized. A striking example is "Si/SiGe 
Semiconductor Heterostructures Investigated by Ion Scattering." 
Application-oriented basic research often provides concrete 
applications even on a shorter time scale, as can be seen in 
"Thin-Film SQUIDS Made of High-Temperature Superconductors." New 
findings in the field of basic research also depend on efficient 
experimental methods. "Optical Frequency Conversion and 
Nonlinear Laser Spectroscopy" is an example of new methods used 
in surface research. 
  Of course, a research centre like the KFA with its excellent 
infrastructure also demonstrates its efficiency by the 
construction and operation of large facilities. A milestone in 
this long-standing tradition is the new Cooler Synchrotron COSY 
inaugurated on 1st April this year and constituting a storage 
ring for ions, in particular for protons. COSY will be a unique 
facility in the medium-energy physics range for years to come, 
not least due to its good beam quality, and provide new insights 
into the structure of atomic nuclei. 
  This brief survey may illustrate that the Research Centre 
Julich will continue to contribute substantially to national and 
international research in the future despite financial 
constraints to be expected also in the next few years.

<H3>    Si/SiGe Semiconductor Heterostructures Investigated by Ion 
Scattering </H3>
  Si/SiGe heterostructures are favourable candidates for new 
high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices based on Si 
technology. The thermal stability of these structures is an 
important issue since high-temperature processing steps are 
often unavoidable during device fabrication. In this work, ion 
scattering was used to investigate thermal interdiffusion 
between the individual layers as well as structural changes. 
Interdiffusion between the layers of heterostructures was 
measured as a function of temperature and initial Ge 
concentration. Since the Ge lattice is about 4% larger 
than the 
Si lattice, Ge starts to grow in a strained mode on Si 
substrates. The distortion of the crystal lattice was measured 
by ion channeling along inclined directions. These measurements 
show directly the angular deviation between the inclined 
orientations of the alternating layers. Depending on the initial 
Ge concentration and layer thicknesses, these structures are 
thermally stable up to approximately 800C. 
<H5>  Optical Frequency Conversion and Nonlinear Laser Spectroscopy </H5>
  A newly developed high-power laser system producing widely 
tunable picosecond light pulses by optical parametric generation 
and amplification in lithium borate 
(LiB[.sup]3[/]0[.sub]5[/]) and silver thiogallate 
(AgGaS[.sup]2[/]) crystals is presented. Computer-controlled 
rotation of these crystals which are pumped by the third 
harmonic (0.355 m) and the fundamental (1.064  m), 
respectively, of a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser allows quick and 
continuous wavelength tuning of the generated light pulses from 
0.41 to 12.9  m. The system is used for nonlinear optical 
spectroscopy of vibrational and electronic excitations at 
surfaces and interfaces. Examples of applications to vibrational 
spectroscopy of the hydrogen-terminated (Si(111) surface and to 
the spectroscopy of direct band gap transitions in a thin layer 
of strained Si at the Si/SiO[.sup]2[/] interface demonstrate 
the versatility of the laser system. 
<H5>  Larix sibirica--an Archive of Climate Research </H5>
  Studies on the verification of atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/] 
concentration are of great significance for reconstructing the 
climate of past time epochs in addition to temperature history 
studies. A particularly important question needs to be answered 
in view of the current development: Does an increased 
CO[.sup]2[/] concentration lead to temperature increase or is 
an increase in atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/] concentration the 
consequence of increasing temperature? Besides isotope analyses 
on maar sediments and annual rings as well as organic 
geochemistry studies, the project Isotope Geochemistry and 
Palaeoclimate may serve to find an answer to this question. 
Palaeoclimate research can certainly contribute substantially to 
the assessment of future climatic developments. 
  Possible climate reconstruction by means of isotopic signals 
from annual rings of trees will be described, especially using 
the isotopic carbon data from a Siberian larch tree. 
<H5>  Interactions Between Biosphere and Atmosphere </H5>
  The biological activities on the earth determine the 
composition of the earth's atmosphere. Some of the close 
interactions between air and plant, i.e., the uptake and release 
of reactive trace gases, are studied interdisciplinarily in an 
exposure chamber using sunflowers, tobacco and maize. Combined 
air chemistry analysis, labelling with the stable [.sup]15[/] 
N isotope and rhizosphere control permit a 
balancing of the nitrogen flows. The uptake of NO[.sup]2[/] 
is only limited by the slit width, whereas NO still has to cope 
with a resistance in the plant itself. After eight-hour exposure 
80% of the [.sup]15[/]N from NO[.sup]2[/] is found again 
in the sunflower leaves (12% in the stalk, 8% in 
the root). 
Ninety-eight percent of the nitrogen is incorporated into the 
organic compound and utilized. Although this uptake only 
contributes a minor share to the nitrogen metabolism of a 
well-nourished plant, these flows are important for the chemical 
equilbria in the atmosphere. This also applies to the release 
of NO, preferably in the dark phase and with changing culture 
medium, as well as to the release of organic compounds. These 
volatile organic compounds can already trap ozone outside the 
plant. 
<H3>  Career of an Enzyme: From Analytic Reagent to Technical 
Catalyst </H3>
  The formate dehydrogenase enzyme (FDH) plays a key role in 
nicotinamide cofactor regeneration. Cofactor regeneration is 
necessary if dehydrogenases are used for synthesizing chiral 
compounds of high enantiomeric purity from prochiral precursors. 
For FDH production with the methylotrophic yeast Candida 
boidinii a continuous production process (fermentation and 
recovery) has been developed up to pilot scale: A high cell mass 
specific FDH activity (50 U/g) is achieved by process computer 
controlled supply of pure methanol to operate the continuous 
stirred-tank reactor (300 l) at an optimum methanol 
concentration of 10g/l. The achievable FDH space-time yield and 
FDH concentration are a function of the oxygen transfer rate of 
the fermenter. Isolation of the intracellular FDH enzyme was 
performed using extraction with an aqueous two-phase system 
(polyethylene glycol/K[.sup]2[/]HPO[.sub]4[/]). A 
technical product quality of 1.2 U/mg FDH was achieved without 
any chromatographic purification step. 
<H5>  Tomographic Methods </H5>
  Tomographic methods are used at the Research Centre Julich 
for a variety of applications. Two different groups of methods 
are employed. Firstly, transmission tomography where the 
distribution of the attenuation coefficients in a sample is 
determined and secondly emission tomography where the 
distribution of radioactive sources in a body is of interest. 
  For medical research, positron emission tomography (PET) is 
used in order to obtain quantitative information about 
diabolisms resolved in space and time. Positron emitting 
materials are injected and three-dimensional source positions 
are reconstructed from the measured gamma-ray emission. A 
similar method although with different physical parameters is 
required in order to determine the radioactive content of waste 
containers. 
  Transmission tomography is mainly used for nondestructive 
material research and quality control. Modern methods provide 
fast reconstruction and imaging of three-dimensional attenuation 
coefficient distributions in samples or workpieces. Spatial 
resolution down to a few micrometres is possible. 
<H5>  Thin-Film SQUIDs Made of High-Temperature Superconductors </H5>
  YBa[.sup]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-x[/] films grown 
epitaxially on suitable substrates, appropriate "gentle" 
micropatterning methods, and a Josephson junction technology 
based on grain boundary engineering resulted in 
liquid-nitrogen-cooled superconducting quantum interference 
devices (SQUIDs) with attractive sensitivity. Magnetometers with 
a field sensitivity in the 100 femtotesla/Hz[.sup]1/2[/] 
range have been constructed using flux focusing. This 
sensitivity is sufficient to record human biomagnetic signals 
such as well-resolved magnetocardiograms. Auditorily evoked 
magnetoencephalograms have also been obtained. Nondestructive 
testing of materials is another area in which SQUIDs can serve a 
useful purpose, one example currently under investigation being 
the magnetic detection of fractures in steel reinforcements of 
concrete structures. An important task to be solved in this 
context is the reduction of interference signals by differential 
methods.

Boucher: "With Sales Down Three Percent in 1993, Mercedes Looks 
for Cooperation With Other Automobile Manufacturers"] 
  [Text] "During the last two years, the automobile market 
declined faster than we could adjust; from now on, we shall lead 
the recovery." Helmut Werner, the new Mercedes-Benz chief 
executive officer [CEO], appointed in May 1993, has great 
ambitions. His company, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, 
will gain market shares in the future. Sales--down to 508,000 
vehicles in 1993 compared with 522,000 the year before--are 
expected to reach 570,000 vehicles in 1994, and between 850,000 
and 900,000 in 1998, at the end of the five-year plan started 
this year. Last year was difficult. The company lost money on 
cars and trucks (trucks were already losing money in 1992). 
Sales declined by three percent, to 64.6 million German marks 
[DM] (about 219 billion francs [Fr]). They should rise by five 
percent this year, reaching DM68 billion. 
<H5>  Cultural Revolution </H5>
  In support of this prospect, Mr. Werner indicated that sales 
during the second half of 1993 achieved an annualized rate of 
300,000, thanks to the Class-C compact car introduced last 
summer. Apart from that, Mercedes plans to expand its line with 
a van called Viano, a small convertible, an all-terrain vehicle 
to be manufactured in Alabama, and a Class-A "mini" to be 
introduced in 1997. Innovation in the product line is the first 
direction of Mr. Werner's strategy. 
  The second one is structural reform. Mercedes eliminated 
11,000 jobs in 1993 and will eliminate another 8,000 this year. 
But this policy, in addition to "adding to the recession 
spiral," is wearing out. Mr. Werner explained that, from now on, 
they must take into account the productivity of capital, not 
just that of labor. In other words, machines must be made to 
work more efficiently. Mercedes will use three methods to 
achieve this end: relocation--one Mercedes vehicle out of 10 
will have to be manufactured outside of Germany "in the 
intermediate term," compared with one in 50 at present; 
increased subcontracting (60 percent of components in 1998 
compared with 55 percent now); and, finally, cooperation with 
other manufacturers. Mercedes is currently negotiating setting 
up plants in Korea and in India, in cooperation with the local 
group Tata. 
  This policy implies cost savings, which amounts to a 
cultural 
revolution at Mercedes where engineers used to rule the roost. 
The five-year plan was reduced by DM3.3 billion, down to DM 18.7 
billion for investments and DM16 billion for research and 
development. Mr. Werner said he was confident as to the 
capacities of the German industry which, for the new age, 
"possesses greater potential" than its U.S. and Japanese 
competitors.

<F P=106> [Article: "Cap Sesa Counting On PME's"] </F>
  [Text] With 1 billion francs[Fr] of annual revenue within 
the industry, representing 3.6 percent of the French software 
and computer services market last year, Cap Sesa Industrie is 
aiming at a six percent share of the market by the end of 1996. 
To attain its ambitious goal, in a context in which acquisitions 
are at a forced standstill, and in which double-digit growth is 
a thing of the past, this Cap Gemini Sogeti [CGS] subsidiary is 
banking mainly on a new organization and on a shift in strategy 
toward the most promising sectors in terms of growth. "Overall, 
French industry's spending on computerization last year totaled 
Fr92 billion, of which Fr29 billion went into software and 
computerization services alone," says Gerard Mezin, general 
manager of Cap Sesa Industrie. This figure can be expected to 
grow at an average rate of 8.6 percent annually, approaching 
Fr40 billion in 1996, and to represent approximately 35 percent 
of the industrial sector's computerization budgets. "With the 
big enterprises reducing their investments in computerization, 
the growth of the market is currently being fostered by the 
medium-sized industries." A Cap Sesa survey of the major 
industrial sectors indicates fields of activity that are still 
largely underequipped. The food processing industry devotes not 
more than one percent of its revenue to information processing, 
versus around 12 percent for the aeronautics and defense 
industries. The automobile, steelmaking, and petrochemical 
industries devote between 2.5 and 3.5 percent of their revenue 
to this need. Based on these findings, the CGS subsidiary has 
decided to shift to a new operational organization, effective 1 
January 1994, involving market development units designed to 
sell to specific sectors and to centers of expertise 
specializing in a particular type of services or applications. 
This should enable Cap Sesa Industrie to better attack the 
market and occupy niches with high value-added potential.

<F P=106> [Interview by Gordon Hewitt of the Manchester Business </F>
School by hfe., date and place not given: "`Europe's Enterprises 
Could Deprive Themselves of Their Future'"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Most of the enterprises in Europe still 
do not seem to know what international competition means, 
concludes Gordon Hewitt. To be sure, sales and production in 
international markets are part of the everyday picture for most 
medium-sized companies as well. But this is by no means 
participating in the global competition. For that reason, 
Europe's businesses could deprive themselves of their future if 
they don't change their way of thinking. 
  The organization of enterprises is much more oriented toward 
local conditions. But if global competition is misunderstood in 
this manner, even the most renowned producers could lose their 
position in the market. It is therefore important for the 
management to organize the company globally, which is far 
removed from "Develop and produce here, sell there." This global 
know-how does not involve merely the geography of the business 
activity but involves thinking past the edge of the national 
dinner plate. And in so doing, the question "Is our company even 
prepared for global competition?" unavoidably emerges. In order 
to create certainty, the company management should specify the 
way into the future and clearly define the goals. Pure financial 
planning would be no substitute for strategy here. 
  Of course, status quo is also not a guarantee for the future 
in global competition. A good position in Europe, for example 
in telecommunications, by no means results in a leading position 
in the international markets. European companies should quickly 
accept this fact, or else their domestic position will also be 
in jeopardy in the future. It is evident even today that, for 
example in the field of high technology, no European enterprise 
is any longer participating in shaping the future. "Sure, 
Siemens or Olivetti are very strong in Europe and help determine 
the markets. But the longer the distance from which one looks at 
the companies, the smaller their importance appears," says 
Hewitt. 
  Truly global enterprises, on the other hand, are present 
everywhere. And if you take that as the standard, you must also 
be concerned about the European automobile industry. A glance at 
the streets of Asia or America should correct Europe's judgement 
of itself. Not even the bastion of high-priced cars has held. 
The stylish European manufacturers have now clearly felt the 
quality-offensive from the Far East. Even so, the impression 
remains that many Europeans still have not grasped the situation 
in earnest. Hewitt thinks that the only chance is repeatedly to 
make it clear to those responsible that not only have the 
economic rules of the game changed, but that an entirely new 
game is now being played. This can be compared to England's 
situation in the postwar era; there, too, attempts were made to 
keep or further develop the old virtues and capabilities. This 
was the reason that the connection was missed. What remains is 
only nostalgia--such as for the auto names of Triumph or Aston 
Martin. Reversing this process is an urgent task for the 
management. There are enough examples of this as well, such as 
British Airways. This airline has a past as a totally 
insufficiently managed state-owned enterprise and is today one 
of the leading airlines in the world. The inertia in industry 
also led to new, innovative products no longer being created in 
the old companies, as the "garage manufacturers" at Sachsen 
Computer have repeatedly proved. "Part of the way the rules of 
the game have changed is also that strangers to the industry 
suddenly take up a production and do it very successfully," says 
Hewitt and refers to the conflicts between Nintendo and Atari in 
computer games, Toshiba and IBM in laptop computers and Canon 
with ex-champion Xerox in copying.

  Viewpoint: Europe can do it. Juergen Knorr, 
member of Siemens Corporation's board of directors and director 
of its Semiconductor Division, believes in a recovery of lost 
ground by European microelectronics. 
  In the eighties the German semiconductor industry suffered 
harsh losses in position vis-a-vis its American and Asian 
competitors. The cause are the work hours per annum: today 1519 
h in Germany while 1857 h in the U.S.A. and 2007 h in Japan. The 
net labor costs are about the same in Germany and in Japan, in 
the U.S.A. 20% lower, but the supplementary labor costs 
are in 
Japan 37% and in the U.S.A. only 33% of what they 
are in 
Germany. 
  Manufacturing wafers for the 1 Mbit DRAM (Dynamic 
Random-Access Memory) in Germany thus costs 10% more than 
it 
does in the U.S.A. and 16% more than it does in Japan. In 
the 
nineties the European and especially German semiconductor 
industry has invested a great deal into holding its ground under 
such a pressure from abroad. 
  System engineering was expanded. Many innovations coming 
from 
Europe have found acceptance worldwide, among them the GSM 
mobile radio system and DECT cordless telephone Standard for 
which ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits) had been 
developed. 
  Semiconductor enterprises in Europe underwent slimming 
cures. 
Production was tightened and wage-intensive operations 
transferred to Southeast Asia. 
  Collaborations were entered into so as to reduce the rising 
cost of new technological developments. An example is the 
agreement with IBM and Toshiba regarding the joint chip 
development. 
  If the European policy were to create conditions equally 
favorable for competitiveness, then an invigorated semiconductor 
sector could be supporting other sectors of industry with its 
innovations.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Mueller, interviewer for INGENIEUR </F>
DIGEST] 
  [Text] Interview: Many Chances in the 
Recession 
  Prof. Dr.-Eng. Hartmut Weule, on the Daimler-Benz AG 
[Aktiengesellschaft = Corporation] board of directors 
responsible for research and engineering, warns against 
underestimating research during crises. 
  Q. You call for a different research policy in Germany. Why? 
  A. Although both government and industry pump a lot of money 
into research and development, there is no equivalent output in 
terms of innovations good enough to be entered into the world 
market. There is simply something wrong with the way research 
and development in Germany are being managed. For instance, 
assistance to medium-scale research is based on insufficiently 
strategy-oriented considerations while at the same time 
mission-oriented large-scale research facilities are engaged in 
too wide a range of tasks. 
  Q. Has, because of this, German research been knocked down? 
  A. No, there are downright very promising signs. I am 
thinking of the EC (European Community) Project AIT: "Advanced 
Information Technology in Design and Manufacturing" as an 
example. Spurred by Daimler-Benz, it could revolutionize the 
entire European Aero-Space Flight industry. Because it brings 
user and provider of information technology together during the 
development and production processes. Positive signs are also 
coming from the "Round-Table Microelectronics", launched by 
Siemens, IBM, Bosch, and Daimler-Benz as well as from the 
"Consensus-Group Production Technology." Innovative projects and 
research strategies regarding microelectronics and production 
technology in the application-oriented industry are being 
developed here by thinking 15 years ahead. 
  Q. But will Germany gain something from this during the very 
next few years already? 
  A. No. Especially in a time of crisis affecting both the 
economic boom and the business structure, however, it would be 
wrong to aim for better short-term results only. While the 
current strained economic condition creates problems, it also 
harbors good chances for the German economy. 
  Q. What chances? 
  A. One could apportion the research budgets in new ways and 
change the modality so as to soften up structures which have 
become rigid. Using its ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated 
Circuits) in the indispensable key technologies such as 
microelectronics, Daimler-Benz plans to recover lost ground 
vis-a-vis Japan and the U.S.A. by way of international 
collaboration. In environmental engineering, moreover, we want 
to assume the top position from the very start. Wherever 
necessary we will enter into strategic alliances with other 
research partners. I am thinking here of energetics and space 
flight particularly.

<F P=106> [Article by Siegfried Hofmann under the rubric "Companies </F>
and Markets": "BASF AG/R&amp;D Work Remains Steady at Around Two 
Billion German Marks [DM] in Spite of Recession - Innovation 
Processes to Become Faster and More Efficient. `Research Has to 
Be Strong Where Business Is Still Weak'"] 
  [Text] Ludwigshafen, Saturday-Sunday, 4-5 Dec 93 
(HANDELSBLATT)-- The BASF group will invest around DM2 billion 
in research and development again in 1993 too and thereby is 
emphasizing its intention of not neglecting innovation efforts 
even in a phase of dwindling earnings and tight resources. All 
the same, the changed economic and competition situation also 
has not left the chemical group's R&amp;D divisions unaffected. 
  For instance, a number of organizational changes lie hidden 
beneath the since 1990 largely steady application of funds, 
BASF's head of research planning, Professor Horst Konig, 
states in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT: In the years since, 
BASF has turned heavily to the methods of project management 
with the aim of making innovation processes faster and more 
efficient. They include first of all clear agreements on goals, 
individual development steps and schedules. Planning itself 
takes place within the framework of a strategic performance 
target of the managing board based on individual suggestions 
from the fields of concentration ("bottom up"). At the same time 
the company has also for a short time been encouraging 
innovative behavior via an innovation prize for BASF personnel, 
which was awarded to two research teams for the first time a few 
weeks ago. 
  Konig sees the main concern of project management to be 
the speeding up of research projects. "Because in the chemicals 
industry time is more often than not more important than money." 
For him the importance of the time factor can be seen, for 
example, in the fact that today almost 10 years are required for 
the development of a new plastic, 12 years for plant protectives 
and on average 15 years for pharmaceuticals. As a result, a 
half-year's delay could already lower a project's overall 
profitability by up to 40 percent. 
  Konig blames a portion of these long development times on 
the especially time-consuming (and thereby 
innovation-inhibiting) approval terms and conditions in Germany. 
Just the thorough testing of a new substance in accordance with 
the law today requires around 1.5 years. However, because 
substances of this kind are often used as additions or 
intermediate products in a multistage process, this expenditure 
of time can easily build up. Hence, the aim of project 
management--which one could wish for the government approval 
process too--is precisely to lessen these delays also. 
<H5>  Concentration on "Core Knowledge" </H5>
  More precise planning, project management and a more 
critical 
analysis of prospects for success have, says Konig, 
contributed to the fact that the number of individual research 
projects in the BASF group has been reduced since the end of the 
eighties from 800 to around 600 now. An additional reason for 
this was the more recent changes in the product portfolio. For 
instance, the retreat from the especially research-intensive 
field of concentration of structural materials. 
  However, Konig by no means wants to have anything to do 
with applying to research the motto of "concentration on core 
fields." Rather the goal here has to be concentration on "core 
knowledge," he says. He points out that dealing with new fields 
of concentration in the final analysis constitutes a 
prerequisite for the further development of a company. 
  BASF too would never have entered many of its major fields 
of 
concentration and would not have been able to find its present 
structure if it had concentrated its development activities 
instead on already strong fields of concentration. So, in 
principle research has to be strong precisely where one is not 
so strongly developed in business, Konig stresses. "All the 
branches cannot be cut off the tree, otherwise it will not grow." 
  How strongly the emphases and orientation change he 
illustrates by the example of BASF's four large central research 
facilities: For instance, the main laboratory today is regarded 
as a "life science" center (with a distinct emphasis on the 
field of research of pharmaceuticals and plant protectives and 
biotechnology). In the plastics laboratory there is an ever 
stronger move toward research on materials, while the color 
laboratory has been generally dealing with the optical 
properties of materials and has developed an emphasis in the 
field of "effector materials." In the ammonia laboratory (which 
traces its origin to fertilizer research) they are turning ever 
more strongly toward research on catalysts, which play a central 
role in almost all chemical production. 
  Konig rates the present basic structure of BASF's 
research as "solid and well adapted for the future," whereby, no 
doubt above all, efforts in the field of "life sciences" will be 
still intensified in the future. When the company is presently 
attending to developing a "vision" for all its research, so as 
by no means to create a sheer slogan, but to create a genuine 
leitmotif that presupposes a basic direction, without unduly 
restricting the researchers' creativity. 
  Konig expects that an important change in overall 
chemical research will above all be the fact that in the future 
one will in general have to turn far more strongly to system 
development. Thus, there will be increasing research in an 
integrated system, whereby chemistry will also act ever more 
strongly as a development partner for other industries. 
<H5>  Research in an Integrated System Gaining in Importance </H5>
  While in Konig's viewpoint one can blame German chemical 
research for all told only a few failures (rather, he ascribes 
the industry's current problems to too rapid market changes), he 
recognizes a still substantial need to catch up in the area of 
transindustry cooperation in research. He refers to the fact 
that this kind of integrated research is already far more 
strongly established in Japan, for example, where a short time 
ago a 16-partner-strong consortium integrated its work under the 
guiding theme "clean car."

<F P=106> [Article by WIS: "German Aerospace: More Operations to Be </F>
Eliminated; `Existence of Defense Technology Is Endangered'"] 
  [Text] Munich, HANDELSBLATT, Tuesday, 7 Dec--"If the 
defense budget continues to be used as a quarry in the Bonn 
budget, the only thing left for us to do will be to close down 
or sell off our defense technology." Juergen Schrempp, the 
chairman of the board of the German Aerospace Company (DASA) in 
Munich leaves no doubt that further cuts in the military 
procurement budget will seriously jeopardize the existence of 
the defense technology industry in the aerospace branch and once 
again place thousands of jobs at risk. 
  He said that DASA defense technology operations have already 
been cut back about 60 percent since 1990 and the workforce has 
been reduced from 16,000 to 9,000. Now many business sectors are 
already facing a "subcritical size." "After a certain point we 
can no longer maintain development and production capacities," 
Schrempp said. In some business sectors this point will be 
reached if the Defense Ministry actually cuts back the 
procurement budget, as planned, for 1994 from about DM8 billion 
this year to only DM5.1 billion. Since 1990 this budget has 
already been cut back 60 percent from DM18 billion. 
  But not only is it raining in on the defense technology 
division of the Daimler-Benz Company subsidiary in Stuttgart; 
the weak aircraft market and Bonn's policy of support for civil 
aircraft is making it hard for the aviation division to manage. 
Schrempp reported that an agreement concluded by the government 
with the United States two years ago enables the aviation 
division to continue to obtain indirect support through 
government contracts, but it reduces the direct support for 
development of from 80 to 90 percent of development costs that 
used to be customary in Germany by two-thirds. Indirect aid to 
compensate for this loss is not available here at all. Moreover, 
the existing already small appropriation in the budget for 
aviation of DM60 million for new projects has recently been cut 
back to DM16 million for 1994. "And this," Schrempp said, "after 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union], CSU [Christian Social Union], 
and SPD [Socialist Party of Germany] politicians had shortly 
before admitted that there had been omissions as far as the 
aerospace industry is concerned and promised to provide 
political aid for it." 
  Schrempp stressed the fact that the six plant closures 
announced in October and the reduction of personnel by a total 
of 16,000 to 70,000 is the minimum that is necessary under the 
present circumstances. He admitted that they should actually 
have begun to settle the matter of the all in all 52 plants (in 
connection with the merger with MBB [Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm 
Company]) sooner. Another two plants, among them the one in 
Dresden with 600 employees, are seriously endangered. As 
additionally, reported, the personnel measures planned up to now 
alone will cost DASA about DM800 million for social contribution 
plans and compensation in 1993. 
  The consequence of the unpleasant basic conditions will not 
be that DASA no longer operates in the field of aerospace, 
Schrempp said, "but we don't know whether we'll still be 
operating in Germany." Even now many operations are only 
possible in connection with joint ventures--most of them with 
the French Aerospatiale. The following joint ventures and 
eliminations are planned: 


    -  The whole guided missile division will be moved to the 
joint subsidiary, Euromissile (with Aerospatiale) with its main 
office in Frankfurt. 
  -  The satellite division, which accounts for about 50 percent 
of 
DASA's space operations (2,000 employees), is to be brought into 
a joint venture (Eurosatellite) with Aerospatiale, probably with 
a German main office. 
  -  There is also talk of German-French cooperation on military 
satellites. 
  -  The 18-seat Dornier 228 propellor aircraft is being 
discontinued and is to be built only in China under license. 
  -  The new 30-seat Dornier 328 will in the long run also be 
brought into a European joint venture. 
  -  DASA subsidiary MTU [Motor and Turbine Union, Inc.] in 
Friedrichshafen (diesel engines) is to be transferred to AEG 
[General Power Company]. 
  -  DASA is withdrawing to a minority holding in microelectronics 
subsidiary Temic [Telefunken Microelectronics] (50 percent held 
by DASA and 50 percent by AEG).

<F P=106> [Article by Alain-Gabriel Verdevoye: "Germany: Car </F>
Manufacturer Announces Losses of Seven Billion Francs [Fr]; 
Volkswagen Has Enough Resources to Rebound"--first paragraph is 
L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] The announcement of heavy losses and the recourse to 
the 28.8-hour workweek came as a shock. But the European leader 
might come out stronger. 
  Car manufacturers are like politicians or show biz stars. 
The 
higher we praise them, the quicker we are to dismiss them. Only 
two years ago, observers raved about the forced growth of 
Volkswagen, the undisputed European leader; today, many promise 
it the fate of dinosaurs. 
  True, according to Ferdinand Piech, the German group is 
expected to lose Fr7 billion this year. True, the Wolfsburg 
manufacturer is forced to cut its workweek to 28.8 hours 
(instead of the present 36) in order to save 30,000 jobs. With a 
10 percent wage cut. True, Volkswagen plants remained idle some 
30 days between January and last October, Audi plants some 50 
days over the whole year, and the Spanish subsidiary SEAT 
[Spanish Passenger Car Company] is operating in the red. 
  True, the group's production dropped by 16 percent during 
the 
first nine months of the year--as much as the European market. 
True, production costs are still 15 percent higher than those of 
French competitors. True, finally, investments over the period 
1994-1994 will be 20 percent below the fantastic forecasts of 
the group's former president, Carl Hahn. 
  Yet, the position of the fourth largest manufacturer 
worldwide is in no way desperate. Having little debt, it 
launched a serious campaign last March to increase its 
productivity; it is known by the quite unpoetic name of KVP2. 
Already, 350 plants have been screened, with average 
competitiveness gains of 27 percent within just a few months. 
  The group's models still enjoy a good reputation of quality, 
and high-level technology. Besides, although it is hardly 
represented in the United States, Volkswagen is the most 
international of European manufacturers: it is strongly 
established in East Europe and, during the first half of the 
year, it achieved sales of 167,000 vehicles in Brazil, 64,000 in 
China, and 75,000 in the Asia-Pacific area. Today, the patient 
is suffering but after a long period of recovery it should come 
out still stronger.

Decrease by 25 Percent"] 
  [Text] According to a supplier, during the last four months 
of the year, Renault production should decrease by 25 percent 
compared with last year. In October, production was down 35 
percent! In November, it will be down only 10 percent. In spite 
of successful sales, Renault is hard hit by the automobile 
market crisis. But that is nothing compared with the drop in 
truck sales: minus 50 percent in France in four years! As a 
result, RVI (Renault Industrial Vehicles) must eliminate 1,423 
jobs out of a total of 15,500. All plants will be affected, 
except Limoges.

<F P=106> [Article by Dieter Abendroth, BMFT (Federal Ministry of </F>
Research and Technology)] 
  [Text] Successful Model 
  Altogether 183 firms have so far been supported by the 
government in accordance with the BMFT"s "Assisting 
Technology-Oriented Enterprise Establishments" (TOU) model 
experiment. Jointly with the Information Service, the BMFT is 
devising a "program - implementation of assistance - founders of 
firms" sequence. 
  It is by means of the TOU model experiment that the Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) aims to have 
technological enterprises established in the new Federal States. 
The assistance extends over the length of time it takes an 
enterprise to develop its eventually profitable product and thus 
over the lean initial period of its existence. Not only funds 
for product development but also advice on organizing an 
enterprise and raising private capital for product marketing are 
made available at that time. 
  By last August 183 such innovative enterprises have thus 
been 
assisted with a total sum of about 123 million DM. New top-notch 
workshops have been built. The results of earlier research done 
in the GDR (German Democratic Republic) are being successfully 
converted into novel products. So far most projects originate in 
measurement, medical, and processing practice. Next in numbers 
are projects in the fields of microelectronics, software tools, 
environmental engineering, optics, and biotechnology. 
  What has been learned from the model experiment is that the 
enterprise founders are by far highly qualified persons (see 
diagram). The distribution of enterprises among the new Federal 
States duplicates the distribution of previous research and 
industrial sites among them. At the top is Saxony, followed by 
East Berlin, and Thuringia. 
  Database Diagram (Pie Chart): 377 enterprise founders in 
second phase of approved projects: 
  1. no data available (8.2%) 
  2. others (no education, some study completed, military 
training) (5.0%) 
  3. professional education (technical, manual trade, 
business) 
(3.7%) 
  4. technician (1.9%) 
  5. graduate economist or industrial management specialist 
(1.1%) 
  6. graduate engineer, physicist, chemist, et al. 
(41.4%) 
  7. other degrees (2.1%) 
  8. engineering degree (36.6%) 
  Not surprisingly, there remain gaps in knowledge of and 
experience in industrial management and marketing techniques. 
The enterprise founders try to close these gaps by continuing 
their education or by measuring up to Western partners endowed 
with relevant skills. They are aided here by consultations with 
TOU-Project carriers and by seminars organized by them. 
  In the meantime, a great many thus assisted enterprises have 
completed their development stage and have begun marketing their 
products. A quite encouraging picture emerges here: The first 
firms among them are slowly gaining a foothold on the German 
market and on the international market as well.

TOU-ASSISTANCE 
Tools and Implementation 
  1. Professional Support 
  To each enterprise founder the TOU-project carriers assign a 
team consisting of an industrial manager and an engineer or 
natural scientist. This team advises the founder during 
conception of the enterprise, during work on implementation of 
development plans, and during product marketing or production 
setup. The consultations are free of charge, but cannot be made 
available on an unlimited basis. The team members moreover 
arrange contacts with actual customers, potential customers, 
partners for joint projects, suppliers, and financial investors 
while also doing, if necessary, research on technical and 
marketing problems. Besides providing those free consultations, 
the TOU-Project carriers also conduct seminars which are 
specially planned to deal with problems relating to given 
enterprises and which require payment of a fee for custodial 
service. 
  2. Financial Support 
  Phase I. Conception. Work involved in conception of an 
enterprise is supported with nonrepayable grants-in-aid, toward 
expenses for necessary studies (market scope, technical 
feasibility, etc.) and for certification of operations 
management. The assistance covers 75% of these expenses 
up to 
45,000 DM maximum. The enterprise need not yet be established 
during this phase. 
  Phase II. Development. The enterprise must have been 
established and its founders must be fully devoted to carrying 
out the development plan. Also during this phase they are 
assisted with nonrepayable grants-in-aid covering up to 
80% of 
the expenses, but not exceeding the 800,000 DM maximum. A 
marketable product should be ready at the end of this phase. 
  Phase III. Marketing. During this phase the BMFT can 
underwrite TOU loans. The maximum amount of such a loan is twice 
the large as a concurrent loan from a Home Loan Bank, but will 
not exceed the 500,000 DM maximum. These loans do not require a 
collateral and are not subject to an interest markup so that the 
rate of interest on them is 3% below the market rate. 
  3. Implementation of Support 
  The application for support of an enterprise establishment 
is 
informally submitted to a TOU-Project carrier. The application 
must include a brochure containing all ideas and describing 
essential facts about the proposed enterprise. Following an 
examination of these brochure (which takes about four weeks), 
the TOU-Project carriers coordinate with the applicants the 
further enterprise conception procedure. This includes a time 
schedule, requirements for phase-I assistance, key items in the 
conception work, etc. 
  After completion of the conception work (within about six 
months), the application can be submitted for phase-II 
assistance. A decision by the BMFT is then reached within six 
weeks. Following the development phase (2-3 years), the 
enterprise concept is to be checked out and prepared for 
realization. Enterprises often require a second round of 
financial support, for preparation of product marketing. When 
necessary, TOU loans can now be applied for at the German 
Equalization Bank.

Privatization. With the help of business contacts, 
the Velox Automation Ltd is finding the direction to the profit 
zone in West Europe 1994. Established in 1990, this new 
technological enterprise employs already 13 workers. 
  "Direction to profit zone has been found" say ex-officer 
Wunderwald. 
  The family of products offered by the team of ex-officers 
includes special sensors for operation in intricate and extreme 
environments, also robust but efficient measuring instruments as 
well as control and regulation engineering devices. The new 
developments, registered under the trademark "Velomat", utilize 
the latest knowledge and experience concerning error-tolerant 
networks and simulation of complex sensor or actuator fields. 
  The founders of this enterprise located at the Brauna in 
Saxony had previously worked in the Department of Scientific 
Instrument Design at the Officers' College in Kamenz. Reinald 
Wunderwald, the guiding spirit of the founding foursome, did not 
want to wait till others would decide his professional fate. He 
aroused in his friends enthusiasm for establishment of an 
engineering office: "We should be able to successfully apply our 
technical know-how and team spirit to production of civilian 
goods." 
  The four of them plunged into preparatory theoretical work 
and then let an enterprise consultant help them with the 
financial concept. After the Velox Ltd had finally been 
established in spring 1990, there followed usual difficulties: 
aggrevation with hesitant bankers and attendance in many places 
at the same time. Simultaneously with the development of a 
salable product line, there also had to be built up a core of 
customers. 
  During this difficult phase the Velox team made contact with 
the VDI/VDE- Technology Center for Information Technology. The 
offered TOU (Technology- Oriented Enterprise Establishments) 
assistance program was gratefully accepted and subsidies were 
quickly approved. Meanwhile, the Velomat product line has grown 
to include 20 items and more are being developed. Stimulation 
for this is now already provided by the expanding core of 
customers. 
  This TOU assistance provided the foundation for dynamic 
evolution of the Velox Ltd from an engineering office into a 
manufacturing enterprise. "The program has helped us a great 
deal" says Wunderwald. He does not hide, however, that arriving 
so far has required quite a lot staying power. "We relied too 
much on the East German medium-size industry." The recession in 
machine manufacturing in the old (East German) States created 
gaps in the original conversion plan. 
  The management team of this enterprises, which had already 
grown to a staff of 13 employees, was helped by business 
contacts in Austria, France, and the Netherlands in overcoming 
those deficiencies. "The present status of orders indicates that 
next year we will have reached the profit zone" joyfully 
announces Wunderwald.

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Willeke: "Fractal Research"] </F>
  [Text] The Ingenieur Digest (ID) interviews Prof. Dr. 
Hans-Juergen Warnecke, the new president of the Fraunhofer 
Society, about the future of German research and his 
specialty--factory organization. 
  ID: How do you see the special place of the 
Fraunhofer Society within the German research community? 
  Warnecke: We are actually a service operation for society 
and 
the economy. The special mission of the Fraunhofer Society is to 
bridge the great gap between knowledge-oriented and 
result-oriented research. Consequently, our researchers ought 
not be viewed simply as scientists but as salesmen and 
entrepreneurs as well. 
  ID: That sounds like an excerpt from your book 
The Fractal Factory. What do you intend to change in the 
Fraunhofer Society? 
  Warnecke: A new man at the top always does things 
differently 
because he brings in a different mentality. But not just for 
that reason alone. Conditions have changed for the Fraunhofer 
Society. I shall therefore strengthen the promising 
decentralized structure and management of the Society. The 50 
institutes that we have, including those in the new federal 
states, operate as independent profit centers in their own 
specialty. They have to market accordingly and constantly 
monitor their own efficiency. 
  ID: The knowledge-oriented and result-oriented 
research dichotomy you refer to has been much discussed. How do 
you view the relationship between basic and applied research? 
  Warnecke: Basic research, as always, is very important. We 
need basic research knowledge upon which to build, without, 
however, being under the constant pressure of seeking 
applications and uses. The question really is just how much 
basic research and how much applications research we should 
undertake. It is my opinion that applications research should, 
owing to current innovative weaknesses and the great need for 
quick innovations, receive the greater emphasis. 
  ID: Do you welcome this development. 
  Warnecke: There is no other choice for me. I don't want to 
start an allocations war. That would be ridiculous. We must--in 
view of limited resources--set priorities sensibly within a 
cooperative dialogue with the political, scientific, and 
economic sectors. 
  ID: In your book, you ridicule the slavish copying 
of Japanese production models. What do you propose instead? 
  Warnecke: We have to develop our own concepts as how to 
organize, structure, and manage conpanies in Germany. The 
question today is to survive in a climate of increasingly more 
intensive global competition and under increasingly turbulent 
conditions. We cannot do that if we must first wait for some new 
message of salvation from Japan before getting up off our duffs. 
  ID: Perhaps, the reason for this is that we do not 
have a salvation plan of our own. What, then, specifically has 
to be changed in the German business world? 
  Warnecke: It must constantly be in a position to react 
swiftly to new surprises emanating from the customer and from 
the competition; innovations must become routine. A single 
production process is no longer decisive for maintaining 
competitiveness in such a changed situation. Rather, 
communications and information exchange between the various 
specialists must be perfected. In this way the logistics--in the 
broadest sense--will be made available for the successfully 
breaking bottlenecks. This is why German industry has suddenly 
found itself is such difficulties. 
  ID: You therefore propose "fractals," that is, 
relatively independent operational entities, as the solution. 
How would that function in practice? 
  Warnecke: In the following way. I view a particular company 
undertaking and proceed to engage a number of subcontracters to 
carry it out. I find them in our own business. Each associated 
group can be viewed as an independent subcontracter to whom I 
assign a specific target goal. In the ideal case, each 
individual associate knows his own target goal. Besides the 
targeting system, a navigational system is also needed. Each 
associate has to know precisely where he stands with respect, 
for example, to processing times, defect rate, and costs. These 
are the data that determine the difference between the specified 
planned state and the actual state of affairs. We hope--and 
various projects have given us reason to hope--that a 
motivational thrust will ensue from the difference between the 
specified and actual states so that the process continually 
improves itself. 
  ID: Isn't there a danger of the subcontractors 
becoming too independent? 
  Warnecke: I don't think so. The overall organization ought 
not become chaotic. We shall--as before--have a top management 
team, but with the flatest possible hierarchy. 
  ID: Is management ready for this? 
  Warnecke: Of course there will be a learning process. It is 
simply not going to be the case that the individual fractals, 
the business entities, or cells--it doesn't matter what you call 
them--will only be established and structured from top 
management once, and then left to be. Further improvements will 
be made whenever deficiencies or problems are detected. The 
system will have its own dynamic. We are bringing the 
customer-supplier relationships together in an internal 
competition. 
  ID: Please give an example. 
  Warnecke: Take, for example, the present maintenance field. 
As a supplier to the production field, it had to be understood 
as a subcontractor. In future, it will no longer have a fixed 
budget with a fixed number of workers. Instead, it might be 
decided that you will only be budgeted on the basis of half the 
number of your staff workers. The other half you will have to 
earn by performing services and jobs for which the production 
groups or fractals contract you. 
  ID: In developing such model factories, do you 
have any specific examples in mind? 
  Warnecke: There have been and continue to be companies that 
already practice this. Science is lagging behind. One example 
that comes to mind is the Mettler-Toledo Company in Albstadt. It 
was brought to my attention by someone who had read my book and 
said that he had seen my "fractal factory" in operation there. 
  ID: Have you found any emulators? 
  Warnecke: Yes, in the meantime there have been small to 
medium-size companies that are attempting to do the same. But 
any one who attempts to do this must be fully aware that you 
simply cannot buy an organizational structure. You have to find 
your own specific solution. 
  ID: After the collapse of entire industries, the 
East German enterprises are in particular need of structural 
solutions. Does your concept offer any hope in resolving these 
immense difficulties? 
  Warnecke: It would be presumptuous of me to claim that those 
very special problems could be eliminated in this way. But there 
is a certain harsh advantage in starting from point zero. In 
some ways, it is simpler than attempting to introduce changes in 
a matured West German organizational structure. Out of 
necessity, that is now being attempted with brute force. There 
are some opportunities for it in the eastern states. 
  ID: Are they being taken advantage of? 
  Warnecke: Opel has introduced a policy change in its 
Eisenach 
plant. A manager also wanted to show me a factory in 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a branch of the Pfanni Company in 
Munich, that was operating on my principles. The manager told me 
that he had actually structured his plant contrary to 
instructions from Munich, with the strong support of the workers. 
  Professor Warnecke has headed the Fraunhofer Institute for 
Production Technology and Automation; he is a member of the 
management boards of various institutes and companies; and he 
teaches at Stuttgart University. By virtue of his books and 400 
professional publications, he is considered the pope of factory 
planners.

<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  In advanced industrial countries the production of knowledge 
and the turning of this knowledge into innovative products and 
manufacturing processes are decisive for growth and prosperity 
and determine the importance of countries in international 
politics. Japan has proven to what extent this is possible. 
Bavarian industry too has been able in recent decades to 
strengthen its position in the international innovation 
competition. But, considering the dramatic shifts of emphasis in 
world markets because of Japan and the emergent industrial 
nations in East Asia, one asks the question what is to be done 
to maintain Bavarian industry's position and to strengthen it 
further in the coming decades. 
  Against this backdrop the Bavarian state government's 
scientific and technical advisory board commissioned IFO to 
analyze Bavarian industry's strengths and weaknesses in 
individual fields of technology, to reveal growth opportunities 
for Bavarian industry with alternative scenarios for the future, 
and to work out points of departure for Bavarian research and 
technology policy for ensuring and strengthening Bavarian 
industry's innovation might. 
  The study was made in 1991 by the industry and structure 
department (then headed by W. Gerstenberger). The analysis is 
based for one thing on making use of the data on world R&amp;D 
output prepared by IFO's patent statistics department, and on 
another on interviews of high-tech companies as well as of 
scientists and engineers at universities and government research 
institutes. The people in charge of the research project were 
aided by Eberhard Buckel, who performed the extensive 
computations for the analysis of international patent 
statistics, which are documented in detail in a table appendix. 
The interviewees' willingness to be interviewed at length was a 
prerequisite for the study's being done. The people in charge of 
the project would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to 
the participants for this. 
  The study could not be published till now, after the 
scientific and technical advisory board developed 
recommendations for further action based on the study and 
presented them to the public at the end of 1992.

<H5>  The Most Important Results in Brief </H5>
  Bavarian industry has strengthened its position in the 
Federal Republic of Germany in recent decades and in so doing 
has concentrated on aerospace, motor vehicle manufacturing, the 
electrotechnical and electronics industry and machine 
manufacturing as emphases. 
  German inventors are generally doing well with third place 
in 
the international innovation competition. Strengths 
(environmental engineering, transportation engineering, chemical 
engineering) and weaknesses (electronics, data systems and 
communication technology, biotechnology and genetic engineering) 
show here. Bavarian research holds an above-average position 
within Germany in almost every field studied. This is especially 
pronounced in laser and superconductor technology and power 
engineering, but also in electronics and data systems and 
communication technology. Diverse non-industrial research 
activities pepper the research fields forming the basis of this 
study. 
  The picture of future research requirements is based on 
three 
scenarios (the affluent information society; environmental 
problems; East-West and North-South tensions) and their effects 
on specific fields of application of technology and on spheres 
of life. These seven fields are data systems and communications, 
the environment, energy, transportation, agricultural 
production, medicine/health, and security and defense. 
  Metrology and control engineering will gain in importance 
from various viewpoints in the future, resulting in 
corresponding research requirements in the fields of 
electronics, optronics, sensor technology, micromechanics and 
microsystem engineering. The field of data systems and 
communications likewise requires research in electronics, 
optronics and photonics--specifically: new compound 
semiconductors, three-dimensional components, optical 
waveguides, systems for optronic or photonic data processing, 
microsensor technology, and microsystem engineering. 
  There is a great demand for research in laser technology and 
superconductor technology, for which tremendous application 
potential is in store if high-temperature superconductors can be 
used in practice. 
  The field of materials, including surface and thin-film 
technology, is likewise a research field of a crucial nature. 
Materials for electronics, engineering ceramics, lightweight 
construction materials, high-temperature materials, functional 
polymers, composite materials and biological polymers are 
important research directions with a great demand. 
  Public health, agriculture and ecology need research results 
from biotechnology and genetic engineering. Protein, peptide and 
enzyme research, microorganisms and genome decoding are the 
keywords for research directions. 
  A research policy priority for the field of data systems and 
communications is to be inferred from the scenario-influenced 
trend in various fields of application of technology. The 
structure of Bavarian industry provides a good basis for this. 
This prioritizing includes microelectronics, optronics, sensor 
technology, micromechanics and microsystem engineering as well 
as the materials possible in each case. It also includes the 
development of more powerful computers and corresponding 
software. 
  In addition, research emphasis should be placed on the 
fields 
of photovoltaics, hydrogen technology and recycling--especially 
of electronic equipment--and on certain research fields in 
biotechnology and genetic engineering.

<F P=106> [Article by Martine Laronche: "Consequence of the Air </F>
Transport Crisis: Airbus Industrie Received 59 Order 
Cancellations in 1993"] 
  [Text] Airbus Industrie will not present its results this 
year. No official reason was given, but this was a particularly 
difficult year for the aeronautical industry (LE MONDE, December 
28, 1993). Overall, Airbus Industrie is said to have received 
some 59 order cancellations in 1993 and a total of 38 orders, 
yielding a negative balance of 21 aircraft. In 1992, the 
European aircraft manufacturer had a better year, with 136 
orders for 95 cancellations. 
  The manufacturer was particularly hard hit by order 
cancellations from the Irish company GPA (Guiness Peat 
Aviation). Last May, GPA was saved from bankruptcy by the U.S. 
group General Electric. In September, it announced a drastic 
restructuring plan. Airbus was more affected than Boeing, as its 
firm orders dropped from 91 aircraft (for delivery during 
1993-2000) to only six to be delivered in 1997 and 1998. After 
this cancellation, the Toulouse-based consortium recalled that 
it still had orders for a total of 55 aircraft--mostly A-320s 
and A-321s--to be delivered to GPA by the year 2000. 
  These mediocre results are due to poor economic conditions 
for airlines. Following an all-time high deficit of $4.8 billion 
in 1992, based on figures published by the IATA [International 
Air Transport Association], their losses are expected to total 
$2.4 billion this year. The overcapacity crisis drove airlines 
into a price war. In this context, they drew up drastic fleet 
and staff restructuring plans. Airbus Industrie is obviously not 
the only manufacturer to bear the brunt of these. For its part, 
Boeing announced a few weeks ago that it had received 226 orders 
during the year, but 214 airplanes were retired. 
  Nevertheless, the European manufacturer's deliveries 
proceeded at a satisfactory pace. They should account for 138 
aircraft in 1993, compared with 157 in 1992, which was a very 
good year. However, sales should be higher in 1993 than in 1992 
($7.6 billion) because of the delivery of long-haul A-340 jumbo 
jets. 
  On the bright side, 1993 was marked by the introduction of 
the Airbus A-319 carrier at the Le Bourget Show. The A-340 was 
set into service in March 1993 at Lufthansa and Air France, and 
the first A-330 was delivered to its launching airline, Air 
Inter, in December.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Gallard: "A Khaki Airbus"] </F>
  [Text] The beasts of burden of French aviation are worn 
out. The humble stars of current events, the 82 Transall and 
Hercules C130 aircraft of the military transport fleet see 
service in all armed interventions and all humanitarian 
operations. These aircraft, 30 or more years old, will have to 
be replaced just after the year 2000. This retirement date is 
scheduled even sooner in Great Britain and is similarly close in 
Germany (co-producer of the Transall), Spain, and Italy. Their 
replacement by a European "future large aircraft" (FLA) has 
become a burning, even explosive issue since eight chiefs of 
staff for the Army and Air Force met in Paris on 20 December at 
a meeting chaired by French General Lanata. 
  This meeting uncovered three weighty issues: The creation of 
a military subsidiary of Airbus Industrie; the possible 
invention of a new mode of financing in response to the American 
GATT challenge; and the development of a new type of engine by 
[French national aircraft engine manufacturer] SNECMA in 
association with European partners. The role of party-pooper 
was played by the American company Lockheed with its offer of a 
share in the production of the updated Hercules C130-J. The 
Americans have courted British manufacturers with subcontracting 
offers worth more than 10 billion French francs [Fr]. 
  All this crazed commotion has one aim: to reduce the 
estimated cost of the FLA by one-third from its initial Fr35 
billion for 200 aircraft. Public paymasters gagged when this 
price was announced, and began to eye offers from America 
(Lockheed) and the Ukraine (Antonov) that were proposing new 
versions of old models. French military officials, however, 
considered any deal with the Ukraine to be too risky. As for 
the Hercules C130-J, they found its cargo bay too narrow. "We 
need an aircraft with a fuselage diameter of four meters --like 
the large Airbuses and the FLA project -- so that we can carry 
large helicopters or anti-aircraft missile batteries without the 
need to ask the Americans if they would be kind enough to lend 
us planes bigger than the Hercules," General Lanata insisted. 
It appears that he convinced his colleagues that it would be 
better to cut down the FLA estimate rather than make do with the 
diameter of the American aircraft. 
  The first novelty was that, instead of the usual step of 
creating a new, tailor-made industrial consortium, the partners 
want to adopt the mold and procedures of Airbus Industrie. The 
idea is to create a military subsidiary where the four majority 
Airbus partners would be joined at least by the Italian company 
Alenia, if not by a Belgian, Portuguese, or Turkish 
manufacturer, since these are the other partners and future 
customers of the FLA project. The advantages of this are 
two-fold: Participants would profit from the efficiency of the 
methods used in civil aviation; and a gateway would be created 
for channeling public subsidies from the military to the 
civilian branch. Since the military is not subject to the 
requirements of GATT, this subsidiary could, without fear of 
reprisals, receive uncapped refundable loans if the 
participating are unable to fund the aircraft's development. 
After all, Boeing is currently hoping to receive an order for 
80 Boeing 747's for military transport, which at the present 
rate of production represents more than three years' work for 
the jumbo assembly line. 
  Second, the generals will content themselves with a simpler 
aircraft, with less ambitious equipment for the mass-produced 
aircraft, and quite different engines. The forces want both an 
airliner capable of flying long distances at high speeds, which 
had led to the decision of a four-engined model, and an assault 
plane capable of landing on an clay runway or a plowed field, 
which requires turboprop engines. This second solution is 10 
percent less expensive. Meeting this week in Rome, 
manufacturers from eight countries know that the choice of 
engine will be crucial. Opposition between Rolls Royce and 
SNECMA 10 years ago blew apart the European fighter plane 
project. Now it looks like a showdown between the young 
Anglo-German partnership of Rolls Royce and BMW and the new 
French-German pairing of SNECMA and MTU [Engines and Turbines 
United]. Both groups have at least a "core" that can be used as 
the basis for a high-speed turboprop engine capable of reaching 
speeds of 800 kph. Aircraft manufacturers and European chiefs 
of staff are keeping their fingers crossed that history does not 
repeat itself.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Elected by Shareholders on Wednesday </F>
19 January, the Volvo Board of Directors Will Have to Clarify 
Its Relations With Renault"] 
  [Text] Volvo shareholders elected their new board of 
directors during a special meeting held on Wednesday 19 January, 
in Goteborg. Bert-Olof Svanholm, currently general director for 
Sweden of the Swedish-Swiss industrial group ABB Asea Brown 
Boveri, was elected chairman of the board, replacing Pehr G. 
Gyllenhammar. His first task will be to determine what he 
intends to retain from the partnership agreement signed with 
Renault in 1990. 
  Mr. Svanholm, 58, was nominated in December by a group of 
large Volvo shareholders, representing together about 40 percent 
of the board of directors votes, to succeed Mr. Gyllenhammar who 
resigned on 2 December 1993 after the failure of the planned 
merger with Renault. In addition to Mr. Svanholm, six new 
directors were appointed at the meeting of shareholders; one of 
them is Louis Schweitzer, CEO [chief executive officer] of 
Renault, the largest Volvo shareholder with nearly 10 percent of 
its capital. However, Mr. Schweitzer did not attend the Goteborg 
meeting. 
  The other directors are Per-Olof Ericsson (general director 
of the Sandvik group--special steels, tools), Haakan Frisinger 
(former general director of Volvo from 1983 to 1987), Tom 
Hedelius (president of the Handelsbanken [Commerce Bank]), 
Bjoern Svedberg (president of the S.E. Banken), and Soren Gyll, 
the current Volvo general director. Three union representatives 
also sit on the board. 
  Speaking to some 700 shareholders, Mr. Gyll declined to give 
any material precision concerning Volvo's future strategy and 
the future of the Renault-Volvo partnership set up in 1990 by 
the two manufacturers. "The forms that the partnership or 
non-partnership with Renault should take are a priority for both 
Volvo and Renault," Mr. Svanholm merely stated. 
  The next regular general meeting of the board, scheduled for 
20 April, will consider this matter, as well as that of the 
Swedish group's industrial strategy.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Aerospatiale Cut its Losses in 1993"] </F>
  [Text] Paris--Aerospatiale "substantially" cut its losses 
in 1993 compared to 1992 in spite of "some of the worst 
circumstances it has ever experienced" and the French group 
expects no recovery in 1994, according to a statement by its 
president, Louis Gallois on 5 January. 
  In 1992 the French aeronautics manufacturer recorded a net 
loss of 2380 billion francs. Gallois estimated that "balance 
should be achieved in 1995 at the latest." The turnover figure 
for 1993 should be five percent lower and reach about 49.3 
billion francs, plus or minus one hundred million francs, 
compared to 51.9 in 1992. 
  According to the Aerospatiale president, the group hit 
"bottom" in 1993, "even if recovery cannot be expected for 1994; 
the situation will not improve before 1996-97. In 1993, the 
markets were awful for the civilian sector (planes, 
helicopters), stable for the military sector, and rather good in 
the space sector." 
  Gallois reaffirmed that the anticipated privatization of the 
group will not take place in 1994 nor in 1995, but he still did 
not rule out minority shareholding in the enterprise's capital 
during that period. The French groups Matra and Alcatel have 
already expressed interest in Aerospatiale, and so has DASA 
(Germany), an already very large partner in the French group. 
  Total orders (planes, helicopters, and military and civilian 
space) have dropped--to 29 billion francs in 1993 compared to 39 
billion in 1992--"despite increases in military orders for 
export, and in space orders." At the end of the year, orders 
amounted to 130 billion francs, representing two and a half 
years of activity according to Gallois. 
  Concerning orders for planes with over 100 seats, 1993 was a 
"blank year" and this was also true for competitors Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas: "cancellations slightly exceeded orders." 
Gallois did not give specific figures for order cancellations at 
Airbus for last year. However, indications from aeronautics 
sources are that these amounted to 59, compared to 38 orders. 
But the number of firm orders is uncertain since some aircraft 
sold in Indonesia are excluded, as are Cathay Pacific and Air 
Canada planes, orders for which were announced in December. 
Referring indirectly to Mirage sales in Taiwan, Gallois noted 
"the emergence" of Boeing on the Chinese market against Airbus 
"whose activity there is in slow-motion." 
  ATR (the Alenia-Aerospatiale consortium) recorded 31 firm 
orders in 1994. In this field of regional aircraft, Gallois 
confirmed that there are discussions with other manufacturers, 
Fokker, Dornier, BAE, CASA, Saab, but also Embraer (Brazil), or 
De Havilland (Canada), and he mentioned that several Asian 
countries are definitely interested in the construction of 
planes of this type. According to him, the ATR-82 (which will 
likely be an 80-passenger turbo-prop) could be the key to this 
future field. 
  In the military field, Mr Gallois found that 1993 showed 
"export recovery" and was a particularly "good year for 
missiles." Lastly, Eurocopter, the joint subsidiary of DASA and 
Aerospatiale, felt the collapse of the civilian market but still 
managed to increase its market share. In 1993, orders for mass 
produced helicopters totaled more than in 1992. Eurocopter 
regained its 20 percent share of the world military market, 
which it had abandoned since the Gulf War, thanks to the Turkish 
and Netherlands contracts announced at the end of the year.

  [Text] The Commission has selected 194 new projects under 
its scientific and technological cooperation scheme with the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia. The projects will involve a 
total of 666 partners and will receive ECU31.4 million 
assistance in 1993. 
  A large number of projects have already been supported by 
the 
Commission since the scheme was launched and these absorbed the 
full amount of ECU55 million earmarked for 1992. 
  Those projects consisted in particular in the award of 2,531 
study grants to researchers from the East, enabling them to 
spend an average of three months in some of the Community's 
leading laboratories and to acquire fresh knowhow to be put to 
use on their return home, while establishing valuable contacts 
for the development of networks in the future. Support was also 
given for scientific conferences, seminars and workshops and for 
projects to develop pan-European scientific networks and to 
enable Central and Eastern Europe to participate in Community 
research programmes or COST projects (European cooperation in 
the field of scientific and technical research).

  (Text) The Hungarian branch of the French computer firm 
Bull has just implemented a management personnel change. The 
position of managing director Gerlai Matyas--after the OKHB's 
[National Commercial and Credit Bank] 25 percent buy-out--ceased 
to exist, and, at the end of October, his French managing 
partner Ives Thon's commission also expired. On 1 November, 
their combined positions have been taken by the 37-year-old 
economist Gert-Jan de Kieviet, freshly arrived from the 
Netherlands. His career at Bull began in 1989--earlier he was 
the vice-president of an insurance association--and by 1991 he 
had become the head of Bull's social security department. 
  According to Mr. Kieviet--whose opinion had been influenced 
by an IDC [Information and Documentation Center] analysis on the 
Hungarian computer industry--in recent years, Bull Hungary's 
strength has developed exactly in areas for which IDC predicted 
the greatest growth potential: value-added (complementary) 
services, applications (ready-made, complete solution), and the 
PC sector, respectively. 
  In reference to the future, Mr. Kieviet expressed his intent 
to make the company a market leader in distributed computing 
architecture and systems integration: he will not be a simple 
box-seller, but wants to transform Bull Hungary into a 
production unit with its activities focussed on open systems 
solutions and services while "working together with consumers as 
teams". In the West, the switch-over to open systems is 
extremely expensive and cumbersome, due to the already 
installed, custom-designed systems--made up of a large number 
of computers--and due to the software written for them. 
  In this respect, Hungary enjoys a much luckier position. 
Others, beside Mr. Kieviet, are also looking for these new 
avenues: For instance, presently, a French banking specialist is 
investigating ways to adapt Bull applications to Hungarian 
conditions. 
  Mr. Kieviet places a great enphasis on applications and 
complete solutions; according to his experience, not only in 
Hungary is Bull considered by many to be just a hardware and 
software manufacturer. The new CEO would like, by all means, to 
change this image, showing the Hungarian market how complete the 
Bull product line actually is. 
  He also wishes to introduce a more efficient management: He 
believes that the marketing division must not rigidly separate 
from the other branches. At year's end, the commission of 
commercial director Jean-Luc Chalant will also expire: His 
activity will be covered by existing personnel. 
  The new director has been preparing for the new assignment 
since last summer, by diligently studying Hungarian, 
familiarizing himself with the country. He confesses to have 
found many similarities between Hungary and the Netherlands.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "500 Europe-CIS [Commonwealth of </F>
Independent States] Scientific Cooperation Projects To Be 
Launched"] 
  [Text] Brussels--On 22 December, the European Commission 
announced that over 500 cooperation projects between European 
and CIS laboratories would be launched, with the assistance of 
the International Association to Promote Cooperation with 
Scientists in the New Independent States of the former USSR 
(Intas). 
  The Intas, which was created on the initiative of the 
European Commission, will contribute up to 21 million ECUs to 
these 509 projects, each of which associates at least two 
European laboratories and one laboratory in a former USSR 
country. The funds will be used primarily to pay CIS researchers. 
  The projects selected concern all scientific fields, from 
the 
exact and natural sciences to the applied, social, and economic 
sciences. The principle of this cooperation is to ensure that 
laboratories remain in the new CIS states and are able to 
continue their work. 
  Created in June 1993, the Intas includes the twelve members 
of the European Union, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland, and 
the twelve members of the CIS.

<F P=106> [Article: "Bulgaria: EDF Continues Cooperation on Kozlodoui </F>
Power Plant"] 
  [Text] French Power Company [EDF] has signed 
cooperation accord with Energy of Bulgaria officials covering 
operation and modernization of the Kozlodoui power plant, EDF 
announced on 18 January. 
  The accord signed with the Bulgarian Energy Committee and 
the 
Bulgarian state-owned power company NEK identifies areas and 
modalities of Franco-Bulgarian cooperation over the next three 
years. In addition to the Kozlodoui plant, it provides for 
continuation of cooperation agreements in the domain of power 
system management. 
  Among other things, the agreement provides for creation of 
permanent structures for dialogue and for bilateral financing of 
high-priority nuclear safety improvements. This financing will 
come in addition to funds put at the Bulgarians' disposal by 
international agencies. 
  Franco-Bulgarian cooperation, launched in 1991 with the help 
of European Community funding, has facilitated rehabilitation of 
the Kozlodoui 1 and 2 generating units, which started up again 
recently and are now "operating within acceptable safety 
parameters." NEK has benefited from constant organizational and 
management support since early 1993. 
  The Kozlodoui plant generates 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours 
per 
year, accounting for all of Bulgaria's nuclear energy production 
and 33 percent of the country's electricity. Kozlodoui has six 
generating units equipped with Soviet pressurized-water (VVER) 
reactors; the first four of them had safety problems, according 
to international experts.

<F P=106> [Article signed E.F.: "Samsung To Focus on </F>
Application-Specific Circuits in Europe"] 
  [Text] The Korean company Samsung is counting on its 
300,000- gate array circuits and on its rapid prototyping 
service to expand into the consumer, information technology, and 
telecommunications markets. 
  Samsung, whose ASIC [application-specific integrated 
circuits] activity represents less than one percent of its 
European revenues in semiconductors ($500 million in 1993, up 50 
percent on a world total of $2.3 billion), intends to do 
something about this situation and, quoting Samsung 
Semiconductor Europe spokesman Peter Anders, "to diversify into 
a more stable market than the memory market." His objective for 
1994 is a sales figure of $10 million in this area. To achieve 
this the Korean company, which has just installed its first 
European design center near Frankfurt in Germany, is planning to 
open design centers in all major continental European countries 
in the coming year. 
  As for products, Samsung is now offering a range of gate 
arrays in 0.65-micron CMOS [complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor] technology integrating a maximum of 300,000 gates 
and operating at 3.3-V voltage in Europe. A range of standard 
cell circuits, enabling up to 350,000 gates to be integrated in 
the same 0.65-micron technology, should be available by 
mid-1994. Samsung is aiming at mid-range consumer, information 
technology, and telecommunications applications, where it has a 
certain expertise and where it can take advantage of what is 
considers its two strongest points: the availability of cell 
libraries comprising digital signal processors (DSP) and 
microcontrollers (Z80 compatible); and its rapid prototyping 
capacity (25 days for standard cell circuits and 45 days for 
gate arrays).

<F P=106> [Article by P.O.: "The Train Changes Track Gauge </F>
Automatically"] 
  [Text] Talgo SA of Madrid, Spain, will develop a system in 
cooperation with the Japanese steel producer and mechanical 
engineering firm Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Osaka, which 
will allow railroad cars automatically to change the track width 
of the wheelsets. There is a simple reason for Sumitomo's 
particular interest in further development of the Spanish 
technique. 
  Since the Japanese railways were split up and privatized in 
1987, competition between the railroad companies has increased a 
great deal. The declared goal of numerous railroad enterprises 
is to attract more passengers with a higher level of comfort. 
Since with the traditionally overfilled Japanese trains it will 
hardly be possible to improve the comfort of the cars 
themselves, the railroad companies are primarily intent on 
eliminating the need for many transfers. In numerous cases, 
however, this is only possible if at certain points the trains 
can change their track gauge rapidly. 
  The Spanish Talgo system originated out of the necessity of 
changing tracks for foreign trains when transferring to the 
broader Spanish gauge. In order to do so, the train runs at slow 
speed over a 15-meter-long gauge conversion track. In addition 
to the normal rails, additional rails have here been mounted on 
both sides. The railroad car also has so-called yoke elements 
mounted on the wheels, also on both sides. 
  The yoke elements are lowered at the rail section parallel 
with the actual track. In so doing they lift the train slightly. 
This leaves the wheels free for a brief moment. At this moment 
the guide rails press the wheels into the new position--that is 
to say either onto the narrower or, in the opposite direction, 
onto the broader track. 
  Sumitomo and Talgo now want jointly to improve this 
technique 
and, according to their own information, initially aim 
particularly for the Japanese market, where in this respect 
demand is extremely intense. In Japan a truck with four wheels 
dominates, while in Spain there are two-wheel elements. Further, 
in Japan on countless trains the wheels of the trucks of 
individual cars are directly driven, while in Spain the trains 
are almost exclusively pulled or pushed by separate locomotives. 
  Consequently, trucks and driving wheels must now be 
developed--based on the Talgo system described--which can be 
similarly automatically adapted. The prototypes of powered, 
convertible trucks are to be ready for testing during the course 
of 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by FO: "Daimler-Benz/Mitsubishi: Fifth Summit </F>
Meeting With Concrete Agreements; Semiconductor Know-How From 
Japan for Company Subsidiary Temic Secured"] 
  [Text] Berlin, HANDELSBLATT, Wednesday, 1 Dec--Temic 
(Telefunken Microelectronics, Ltd.), a subsidiary of 
Daimler-Benz, has secured the semiconductor know-how of the 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Access to the so-called CMOS 
[complementary metal oxide semiconductor] technology has been 
opened through a license, something that company head Edward 
Reuter described as a "milestone" in cooperation with the 
Japanese Mitsubishi combine. 
  The Temic agreement is part of a package of projects which 
was agreed on by the top managers of both companies on Tuesday 
in Berlin (which has already been reported in another section of 
HANDELSBLATT). With it, according to Shinroku Morohashi, the 
chairman of the Mitsubishi Corporation, six of a total of 35 
planned joint ventures can be realized. 
  Morohashi and Reuter described the fifth meeting as 
extraordinarily successful. Reuter confronted critics of the 
talks held between the two technology combines for three and a 
half years now with the fact that the participants had been "not 
so impatient" and the contacts "somewhat longer-term" 
deliberately. Morohashi indirectly explained the obviously 
difficult rapprochement of the Germans and Japanese as being 
attributable to "different management methods" and "a different 
corporate philosophy." 
  They also reached a concrete stage on the planned joint 
construction of a metallurgical recycling plant for used cars in 
Germany. According to Reuter, two locations for the 
DM100-million project, in which the Austrian firm, Voest Alpine, 
is also to be participating, are being studied. Mercedes-Benz 
and Mitsubishi want to examine the cost effectiveness of the 
technology with this pilot plant. Another cooperative project 
involves joint research in the field of recycling of plastics. 
  However, an agreement in principle is still to be negotiated 
in detail between Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi Motor Corporation 
on the licensed production of the MItsubishi L-2000 minivan by 
Mercedes-Benz of South Africa. Mitsubishi is at present 
producing from 50,000 to 60,000 units a year of this vehicle 
with a payload of one ton in Japan. According to the firm, its 
worldwide competitors in this class of vehicle are Nissan and 
Toyota. 
  Further arrangements between Daimler and Mitsubishi involve 
a 
joint appearance at the "New Earth '93" environmental exposition 
in Osaka this month, various research fields, joint purchases of 
materials worldwide, and management training. Furthermore, 
Mitsubishi wants to submit an offer to take over the general 
management of one or several of the buildings of the Daimler 
construction project on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. 
  Reuter estimates that his company spends from DM50 to DM100 
million a year on research and investments involving joint 
ventures. With more comprehensive aerospace projects, this 
figure could be considerably higher.

  [Text] An "innovation center for microelectronics" is to be 
created in Dresden. This involves two adjacent facilities to be 
financed in different ways: one will be a joint project of 
German business to develop future technology for electronic 
semiconductors and the other a semiconductor factory which is 
being planned by Siemens in association with the Japanese 
electronics company Toshiba and the Center for Microelectronics 
in Dresden (ZMD). 
  Experts say that the proximity of the research institute to 
the production facility is particularly interesting. Following 
the decision of the Daimler-Benz company to manufacture their 
products in Rastatt, this project is also regarded as further 
evidence from major industries that new production projects 
located in Germany are possible. 
  With DM2.4 billion in investments spread over 10 years, this 
will be the largest microelectronics project in Europe. At the 
same time it is said to be the only production site in which the 
entire technology of chip manufacture will be employed in 
production. The project is to be presented this Thursday in 
Dresden by Siemens board chairman Heinrich von Pierer and 
Federal research minister Paul Krueger (CDU). Negotations on the 
project have been conducted in strict secrecy over the past 
three weeks. In Siemens' plan for chip manufacture, Toshiba is 
to acquire 25 percent of the shares and the Center for 
Microelectronics five percent. The Commerzbank AG and the 
Dresdner Bank AG are participants in the ZMD. The production 
center with 1,200 jobs in its final stage is to be constructed 
next to the ZMD research park. The companies can count on public 
subsidies of 35 percent of the investment total. These are not 
research budget funds. 
  The principal chip production in Dresden will be of 
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for 
telecommunications and automotive electronics. The production of 
memory chips is possible, but is not to be of central 
importance. The plant is to embody the concept of the 
"mini-factory" for microelectronics. A modular structure is 
intended to ensure that the transition to the next semiconductor 
generation can be achieved at relatively low cost. The new 
factory is to begin with the 16-megabit technology and gradually 
widen its range to include up to 256 megabits. 
  The research and development unit ("nested factory") is to 
consist of about 100 workers. Its task is to evaluate new chip 
manufacturing technologies and introduce them into production. 
The goal is to lower the wastage rate, which is sometimes 60 
percent. The companies hope that an increase in profits will 
partially offset the cost disadvantage in comparison with 
semiconductor production in low-wage countries. The experience 
gained in the optimization of production technologies is to be 
made available to all German businesses. Besides Siemens, 
Daimler-Benz, IBM and Bosch also figure prominently here. 
  These companies had already summed up their ideas over the 
summer after negotiations with the Federal government in a 
"consensus paper" on microelectronics. The Federal Research 
Ministry then agreed to support joint projects with other 
partners. The companies are reckoning on DM25 million. 
  For example, a personnel exchange e.g. with Bosch or 
Daimler-Benz is anticipated. At the beginning of December, the 
research ministry invited businesses to participate in the "chip 
factory of the 21st century." Siemens also invited other 
companies to work with them. The project is considered the first 
concrete effect of the agreements which were made as early as 
the spring in the "microelectronics dialog" between the 
ministries of research and the economy on the one side and 
German industry on the other. German microelectronics 
manufacturers had agreed to support one another in the 
introduction of new technologies or in cases when difficulties 
arose with the technology so that valuable specialized knowledge 
would not have to be kept within each company. Bonn says that 
the conditional pledge of support does not mean an about-face in 
research policy. It is said to be important that Germany possess 
not only research institutes but also production plants for the 
newest chip technologies. Even within the government coalition 
there have been varying opinions over the past few years about 
the question of whether the state should support production 
plants for microelectronics. 
  The construction of a Siemens factory for memory chips was 
already under discussion two years ago. But Siemens decided 
against making this investment and noted that these electronic 
components could also be produced in existing locations. 
According to the company, the decision about the plant now being 
planned was accelerated by the investment plans of Texas 
Instruments (TI) in Saxony. The company wanted to produce 
64-megabit memory chips there.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Vilnat: "New Lease on Life for Prestress </F>
Shot-Blasting"] 
  [Text] Development possibilities are opening up for 
shot-blasting thanks to very innovative techniques. 
  Shot-blasting, which consists of propelling small metal, 
glass, or ceramic pellets against the surface of metal parts to 
increase their resistance to fatigue, is finding wider 
applications. Teknoson, a new PMI (small and medium-sized 
enterprise) in the Paris region, has perfected a new method of 
propelling the pellets to their target. The parts to be 
processed are suspended in a metal bowl containing a handful of 
steel pellets. The bowl is connected to an ultrasonic generator 
which makes it vibrate at a frequency of 20,000 Hz. The pellets 
thus set in motion will impact the parts in a totally random way 
at approximately 20,000 times per second. Whatever its shape, 
the part is treated evenly. It is even possible to shot-blast 
hollow parts such as inlet tubing, where the shot enters through 
one opening and exits at the other. 
  The depth of the process can reach 0.8 mm, depending on the 
diameter of the pellets, the length of processing, and the power 
of the ultrasonic transducer. Jian Lu, an engineer at the Cetim 
materials department who has tested numerous samples prepared by 
Teknoson, emphasized that "the shot used comes from ball 
bearings. It is therefore very hard and perfectly spherical. As 
a result, the surface condition obtained is better than the one 
achieved with standard shot-blasting where the particles are not 
always round." 
  The technique developed by the PMI in Saint-Soupplets 
(Seine-et-Marne) is patented and was invented by a Russian 
scientist for the particular purpose of shot-blasting 
aeronautics parts and gun barrels. 
  In addition to these functions, the technique has the 
advantage of being very economical: it does not require much 
shot, does not need the installation of a shot-sorting system, 
and does not use up much energy. Prestress shot-blasting 
applications are very widespread: turbine blades, compressor 
vane footings, springs, tubing, and so on. Furthermore, 
shot-blasting can be used on steel or aluminum as well as on 
titanium. Because of the excellent homogeneousness of the 
process, thin parts do not warp. To achieve the same result, 
standard machines must use two nozzles at the same time. 
  By adapting the shape of the ultrasonic transducer, it is 
also possible to process hollow shapes such as rifle barrels. A 
part can very easily be partially shot-blasted if so desired. 
The surfaces to be protected just need to be covered with 
masking tape, which will absorb the energy of the shot without 
transmitting it to the metal. Teknoson specialists are already 
formulating further developments for their process. For example, 
by adding a powder to the bowl, parts could conceivably be 
plated. But in this field, everything has yet to be invented. 
  Measuring particle velocity is one factor in predicting the 
efficiency of a shot-blast operation. Until now, this parameter 
was very difficult to establish. To solve the problem, the 
Wheelabrator Allevard company, world leader in steel 
shot-blasting, has joined Helispire, a startup company 
specializing in measurement systems design, who has come up with 
the solution: an optical process called Travel. 
  Yves Lecoffre, head of technology at Helispire and inventor 
of Travel, explained that "until now, the only technique 
available was Doppler laser anemometry, a very complex method 
that is much closer to laboratory techniques than to industrial 
ones." Not to mention that the laser-based device is costly and 
must be operated by experts. 
  At present only enterprises like Snecma have invested in 
such 
an installation. Lecoffre pointed out that "our system makes it 
possible to efficiently measure shot particle velocity by simple 
means and at reasonable cost (about 120,000 francs)." His method 
consists of illuminating the measurement area with a rectangular 
beam of white light. When a particle crosses the beam, it sends 
the light back to a lens that is placed perpendicular to the 
light beam. This lens is fitted with a mask featuring two narrow 
slits of different dimensions. The travel time of the reflected 
light across the slits gives the speed and direction of motion 
of the particle. Better yet, by doubling the beam through a 
semi-transparent mirror and adding two more perpendicular slits, 
two components of velocity are obtained (one horizontal, the 
other vertical). The Travel device thus makes it possible to 
measure particles whose diameter size is of the order of 0.5 mm 
at velocities between 1 m/s and 100 m/s with a precision of the 
order of one percent. A computer system collects all the results 
and calculates an average velocity for the particles. As is only 
fitting, the first shot-blaster equipped with the Travel system 
is in operation at Allevard Wheelabrator, but future customers 
have already expressed interest in a machine equipped in this 
manner.

<F P=106> [Article by Scha: "Controls for Robots"] </F>
  [Text] Dortmund--Under the direction of Eckhard Freund and 
in collaboration with the Action Association of NRW [North 
Rhine-Westphalia] Aerospace-Oriented Companies, the Institute 
for Robot Research (IRF) of the University of Dortmund has 
developed a new control concept for automated systems and robots 
by employing "virtual presence" methods. The control concept is 
supposed to serve to make robot and automation systems 
universally usable. For this purpose, the working environment of 
the robot is graphically reproduced on the computer screen and 
the operator can carry out his assignment through the computer 
graphics with the aid of a so-called data glove. The IRF control 
technology then sees to it that the activities are carried out 
in the "virtual world" of the computer graphics--the 
transporting of objects, for example--are replicated by the 
robots. Conceivable applications with a commercial background in 
the space industry are, for example, the inspection and repair 
of costly geostationary communications satellites. Numerous 
applications for this "virtual presence" technology are also 
obvious outside the space industry, in the field of medicine, 
for example, to provide support for operations.

<F P=106> [Article: "Robsyc Born of CEA Alliance With B + </F>
Developpement"] 
  [Text] The robotics unit of the CEA [Atomic Energy 
Commission], located at Fontenay aux Roses (Hauts de Seine), and 
B + Developpement, have developed a robot, Robsyc, capable of 
repositioning small objects accurately and rapidly. Robsyc is 
probably the world's fastest robot today over long 
distances--1.5 meters--owing to accelerations of 8 G, and is 
capable of handling randomly positioned containers weighing 2 
kilograms, lift them by means of suction at the rate of 80 
containers per minute, and reposition them in orderly layers at 
the rate of 8 meters per second. Its precision of plus or minus 
0.5 mm is provided by a simple mechanism based on flat belting 
and capable of four degrees of freedom. B + Developpement (18 
persons and annual revenue of 20 million francs) is located in 
Gemenos, near Marseille. It specializes in "mechanotronics" and 
works under contract on new designs of materials-handling 
robots. According to Gilbert Gras, a B + Developpement engineer, 
Robsyc's capabilities are essentially the result of the very 
innovative architecture of its command control system. To the 
classic "process + corrector" system, the CEA has added three 
model modules: inverse, observer-predictor, and behavior. The 
combination corrects, in real time, the difference between 
calculated and actual trajectories, by means of rapid computing 
cards based on distributed signal processing using industrial 
PC's. Today, Robsyc is a feasibility demonstrator prototype. In 
the coming months, B + Developpement will adapt it to 
multiple-object selective sorting (handling of wholesale 
pharmacist deliveries), and emboxing (depositing of products in 
cellular-like container or arrangement of containers) for the 
agricultural food products industry (fancy boxed chocolates, for 
example).

<F P=106> [Article: "ABB Robotics Launches Two New Robots] </F>
  [Text] ABB Robotics has launched two new robots: its IRB 
1400 (5 kg) and IRB 2400 (10 kg). These are the first two 
products of the new line of robots developed by the ABB group 
under its customized approach to robotization. They feature 6 
axes, operate very rapidly, and follow a trajectory with 
precision. "We know that the primary demands on the part of our 
clients boil down to reduced cycle time, the manufacture of a 
wider variety of products on a small-scale production basis, at 
a reduced price per unit. They also want customized integration 
of products, systems, and services. This is the feedback that 
has prompted us to develop this new line," says Guy Micoulet, 
president of ABB Robotics France. At the heart of the new line 
is the all-new S4 command console, which enables the user to 
rapidly put the robots into operation within his current 
manufacturing process, without delay, without any specific 
development of software, and without costly adjustments and 
fine-tuning. This new line also provides in advance for the 
needs of the manufacturing industries, through various 
innovations. The line includes a Windows-type operating system 
interface that facilitates communication regardless of whether 
the user is an operator, programmer, computer engineer, or 
systems engineer. It utilizes its own technology, and its 
language in the form of interactive dialogue is simple. The 
command console enables very precise adherence to trajectory at 
a high speed. Rapidity of movements is obtained through 
automatic optimization of control. The console utilizes a 
complete real-time dynamic model of the robot arm, enabling 
incremental accelerations and higher speeds of the arm. The 
command system always provides the optimum acceleration 
regardless of conditions of use; as a function, for example, of 
the position of the arm within the robot's work envelope, or 
according to the weight and inertia of the load taken on. The 
system also uses the robot's mechanical potential to optimum 
advantage. The duration of cycles is therefore shorter and 
productivity is improved. ABB Robotics will launch other new 
products and services as part of the new product line it is 
developing together with its clients. Its current gamut of 
products and services provides a platform that can be modified 
and adapted to keep ahead of the needs of industries beyond the 
next 10 years. The group posted a 1992 revenue of $350 million 
worldwide with personnel totaling 1900 employees. R&amp;D 
accounted 
for $35 million of this revenue. Its activity in France 
generated a revenue of 162 million francs with 150 employees.

<F P=106> [Article by toz: "Atomic Cluster Formation Facilitates </F>
Production of Nanostructures"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Specific production of nanostructures is 
hardly possible with the masking techniques used until now, if 
one wants to produce future electronic switches with structural 
widths below about 50 to 60 nanometers. To be sure, using 
converted grid-tunnel electron microscopes scientists have been 
able to place single atoms in a specific spot on silicon 
surfaces. But this technique is slow, because only one atom at a 
time can be worked on, and it would be very expensive. 
  However, new research results by Swiss and North American 
scientists now indicate that there are various ways to build up 
metals, oxides or possibly other compounds as well in a 
controlled manner for functional electronic structures on 
silicon or metals. 
  A Swiss group of physicists at the EPF Lausanne (Institut de 
Physique Experimental, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland) is using a 
guided separation process which leads to clustering or 
depositing on various surfaces. The surfaces absorb individual 
atoms, which by means of very precise regulation of the 
prevailing substrate and material temperatures gather into 
larger aggregations and finally into clusters. 
  In so doing the individual atoms act similar to 
crystallization nuclei in crystal growing. In these processes 
the atomic surface structure also plays an important role for 
the depositing processes, a "shaping, defining" role, so to 
speak. The physicists describe their work principle as 
"diffusion-controlled aggregation." In these processes the laws 
of depositing follow the kinetic behavior of the various 
materials. 
  It has been possible in the laboratory to deposit, among 
other things, several hundred Angstrom-long, strip-like lines of 
copper atoms on surfaces of palladium foils and cluster-sized 
silver particles on bases of platinum. 
  The results by the Swiss physicists are not yet suitable for 
immediate practical application. But they have discovered 
principles with which it is now possible to build suitable 
structures for simple, and later on also more complicated, 
three-dimensionally conceived, electronic components. 
  U.S. scientists at the NIST National Institute of Science 
and 
Technology in Gaithersburg (Maryland) have taken another 
approach. They use laser light in order precisely to deposit 
individual atoms. With their method they were able to build 
several three-dimensional tracks of chromium atoms on a silicon 
base, for example, which are a little more than 30 nanometers 
high and are spaced about 213 nanometers apart. 
  Right now their method functions with metal atoms which are 
directly applied with the laser beam on the bases. In so doing 
the excited metal atoms "ride" on the laser beam, which 
simultaneously also excites the base, so that when they meet 
aggregations similar to those constructed in the Swiss 
experiments are created. This method works quite fast: In one 
minute it was possible to apply 0.7 nanometers of chromium onto 
a relatively large surface of 0.4 by 1 millimeter with a laser 
in the spectral range of 425 nanometers. 
  For the moment the method permits only application of 
straight line structures. But the developers are working on 
being able to produce more complex structures as well. This 
method has the advantage that it is no longer necessary to work 
with many steps of lithographic masking processes and 
considerably more expensive x-ray or ultraviolet light. In the 
subsequent work one will also use two or more laser beams in 
order to apply structures from not just one but several 
materials. 
  At the moment, the still unsatisfactory stability and 
relatively uneven speed of the laser beams has turned out to 
represent a bottleneck. It is believed that this problem can be 
satisfactorily solved in about two to three years. It would then 
be possible to produce structures with widths of six nanometers. 
In this way "nanoelectronic" switches could then actually be 
produced which are about 100 times smaller than today's 
microelectronic switches. 
  Meanwhile, applications have been made for several patents 
for the laser method. The government institute cannot use these 
patents itself and therefore wants even now to conclude 
utilization agreements with interested industrial enterprises 
which are prepared to participate financially and with manpower 
in the future development work, reports NIST (National Institute 
of Science and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, USA).

<F P=106> [Article by OEL: "Brightness of Light-Emitting Diodes </F>
Clearly Improved; Polymer in Conjunction With Indium-Tin Oxide 
Electrodes; Thin Polyphenyl Vinyl Coating"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are based on 
the phenomenon of electroluminescence--if several electrons with 
different energy levels come together, they emit photons. The 
number of photons released is responsible for the luminosity of 
the LEDs and that depends on the material used. 
  In addition to the up to now most frequently used 
semiconductor materials, since 1990, with a discovery by British 
physicists and chemists at the University of Cambridge, we have 
also been aware of organic polymer compounds that are capable of 
electroluminescence. Up to now, however, they exhibited 
conversion rates of only from 0.5 to 1 percent, corresponding to 
200 or 100 electrons per photon released, which is why they did 
not give off enough light for practical applications. 
  A polymer now being used by researchers consists of 
cyanoterephthalyliden, a terephthalic acid used as a substitute, 
the manufacture of which is well mastered. It makes it possible 
to produce LEDs with a conversion rate of up to 4 percent. This 
results in a very high luminosity given the fact that ordinary 
electric light bulbs attain rates of only about 10 percent. 
  The new polymer works in conjunction with indium-tin oxide 
electrodes that are coated with a thin layer of polyphenyl 
vinyls (PPV). It absorbs into its conduction band electrons that 
are injected from the electrode material and the coating. 
  PPV was the first polymer that the team of scientists 
discovered. But it exhibits a relatively high 
electron-conduction band and it could only be made luminescent 
with a very reactive electrode material like calcium. This is 
why its practical application was not possible. But, since it 
attaches itself readily to more stable indium-tin oxide 
electrodes, this makes possible an effective transfer of 
electrodes to the polycyanoterephthalyliden. 
  The developers hope to be able to produce bright displays 
covering large surfaces and, later, computer monitor screens as 
well with this new and, in comparison with semiconductor 
materials, easier to process polymer. This is why they have 
founded a new company, Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd., for 
its commercial application. This company is expected to obtain 
additional capital to work out the production techniques, set up 
possible production, or assign licenses to interested industrial 
companies. The scientists want to continue their search for 
more, similar organic compounds and, in addition, attempt to 
further increase the power output by improving the coating 
between the electrodes and the active polymer. For further 
information: University of Cambridge, Cavendish Laboratory, 
CambridgeCBS OHE, United Kingdom.

  [Text] Pulsed laser beams can be used in many ways for 
material processing. The effects on the material induced by a 
laser pulse are produced in a very short period of time and in 
small areas. Exact knowledge about these effects is important 
for optimal laser utilization. However, there are two goals in 
observation. First, the observation procedure must possess high 
magnification. It should also possess high temporal resolution 
in order to be able to represent the effects of individual laser 
pulses. Professor Oleg Bostanjoglo and his colleagues from the 
Optical Institute of the Berlin Technical University (Strasse 
des 17. Juni 135, 10623 Berlin) have now developed a high-speed 
electron microscope (EM) linked with a pulsed laser which 
possesses the necessary properties. The device makes it possible 
to depict precisely laser-induced crystallization and 
vaporization processes. According to Bostanjoglo, large effects 
can be produced in small target areas by irradiating material 
with pulsed lasers. The high heating and cooling rates lead to 
the formation of new phases and structures in the irradiated 
materials which are not attainable using other methods. The 
technical utilization of the laser is only in its infancy, but 
has already led to important applications. These include the 
boring of very small holes, the labeling of components, the 
hardening of metal surfaces and employment in digital optical 
read/write memory. Until now the electron microscope has been of 
only limited use in the investigation of microscopic effects, 
since while it is sensitive to structure and possesses high 
resolution spatially, in conventional use it possesses only low 
temporal resolution. The Berlin scientists have thus converted a 
commercial electron microscope into a high-speed apparatus.In 
principle, rapid-exposure photographs can be made in two ways. 
In continuous operation the sample is constantly irradiated by 
the electron beam, that is both during and after the laser 
bombardment. With the help of a 
scintillator-storage-oscilloscope combination as a detector the 
individual phases can then be observed with high temporal 
resolution. The second possibility is that of producing 
rapid-exposurejphotographs of laser processing with the help of 
an image enhancer. These photographs are produced by pulses 
either from the source of illumination or from the image 
enhancer.In order to investigate the direct effect of the laser 
beam on the sample, a Nd:YAG laser is combined with the 
high-speed EM. The laser*beam pulse is focused on the sample in 
the EM by a laser objective and a deflecting mirror which has a 
hole for the electron beam. The laser beam and the electron beam 
run in parallel in the same direction and thus make it possible 
to investigate the laser effects in real time in a controlled 
way. The Berlin high-speed electron microscope makes it possible 
to take rapid-exposure photographs with illumination times from 
five nanoseconds. The interval between pictures is between 30 
nanoseconds and a few microseconds. Both reflective EM 
investigations of massive materials and transmission EM 
observations of thin layers can be carried out. The individual 
pictures can be combined into a "film" in order to observe the 
dynamics of laser-induced material transformation. 
Investigations with the high-speed EM have thus far been 
directed towards research on crystallization processes in 
semiconductors, structural changes in metals during laser 
processing, and laser-induced vaporization of thin layers. These 
researchers aim to achieve a better understanding of laser 
processing procedures like removal, alloyage, recrystallization, 
grain formation and vitrification. The projects are being 
supported by the German Research Association.

<F P=106> [Article by GMN: "Laser Monitor for Checking Coating </F>
Thickness; New Laser Systems Monitor Coating Processes On-Line"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--New kinds of laser sensors that can be 
used to inspect materials in particular are currently being 
developed in the Department of Metrology of the University of 
Saarland. As Prof. Alexander W. Koch explained, surface 
structures, component movements, surface rough spots, and 
vibrations, as well as coating thicknesses and optical constants 
of thin surface films, for example, can be analyzed with these 
sensors. 
  Especially the thin coating technique is playing an 
increasingly more important role in environmental and medical 
technology in particular. There is a large number of possible 
coatings that endow the underlying materials with new 
properties. Laser measurement techniques have also proven to be 
very well suited to the examination of optically transparent 
coatings. With them the laser light on the interface between the 
surrounding medium and the coating is in part reflected and in 
part refracted into the coating. 
  The light fractions interfere with one another, dependent on 
the changes in the optical path. He further said that, since the 
difference between the optical paths can only be vaired by a 
change in coating thickness when the material properties are 
constant, they have with this technique a sensitive in-situ 
monitor for the thickness of the coating. The resolution 
maximally amounts to somewhat more than 10 nanometers. 
  When two interferometers are combined in a dual-beam 
experiment, their beam paths form different angles with the 
surface of the coating. If the coating is thicker, there are 
different periodicities of both monitor signals. Both 
interferometers detect the difference between the optical paths 
with high local resolution at the same point on the coating. 
  A comparison of both monitor signals also further provides, 
in addition to the thickness of the coating, the refractive 
index of the coating. Furthermore, Koch explained, computer 
simulations of the signal sequences allow for conclusions as to 
absorption coefficients and the homogeneity of the coating.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Energy Aggregate-Ion Beams </F>
Obtained at IPN [Nuclear Physics Institute]"] 
  [Text] Paris--Aggregate beams consisting of three to four 
high-energy electrically-charged atoms were obtained recently by 
an IPN team at Orsay. These results, according to the IN2P3 
(National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics of the CNRS 
[National Center for Scientific Research]), "give France a 
definite lead in this field." 
  Using a gold source and the Tandem electrostatic 
accelerator, 
the IPN team headed by Serge Della Negra succeeded in producing 
aggregate beams consisting of three to four atoms, each carrying 
one positive charge (Au[.sup]+++[/] and Au[.sup]++++[/] 
aggregate ions) and having an energy of 10 million electronvolts 
[MeV]. 
  Aggregates are assemblies of weakly-bonded atoms (from just 
a 
few to a few hundreds) that constitute a special state of 
matter, the structure and behavior are somewhat similar to those 
of atomic nuclei. Their chemical reactivity and selectivity make 
them useful intermediates in catalysis, optics, and electronics. 
Thus, since the eighties, many laboratories throughout the world 
have been studying them. 
  More particularly, aggregates are increasingly considered as 
a replacement for single-atom ions, to bombard solids. 
Increasing the projectile mass also increases the energy 
deposited on the bombarded area. Bombarding small areas (of the 
order of 100 square angstroms) with single-atom ions would 
require currents of several mega-amperes, but it can be done 
with heavy polyatomic ions (heavier than iron). 
  The idea of producing at the IPN aggregate beams with 
energies of several MeV was formed several years ago; two years 
ago, it became possible to start the project (Orion-Tandem 
project) with financial support from the IN2P3, the CNRS and the 
DRET (Directorate of Research and Technical Studies) of the DGA 
(General Delegation for Weapons). 
  The method used at the IPN consists in placing a source of 
metallic aggregates and its beam-directing line at the center of 
the accelerator and subjecting them to a 10 megavolt potential. 
The positive aggregate ions thus created and pre-accelerated to 
60 kV are injected onto the accelerator axis and further 
accelerated to 10 MeV per charge. 
  At the start, researchers faced two questions: Would the 
aggregates withstand the acceleration, and collisions with the 
residual gas during acceleration until they reached the 
experimental site, 20 meters farther? Experiments performed last 
year with carbon molecular ions (C60 and C70 fullerenes) made it 
possible to answer this question in the affirmative. Apart from 
that, would the electronic setup withstand the 10-15 MeV 
breakdowns that may occur within the accelerator? That is the 
problem that the IPN solved in November. 
  These experiments also enabled the researchers to observe 
very important non-linear effects (coherent effects much higher 
than the sum of the effects of individual constituents) and to 
observe the transmission of shock waves in matter to a distance 
of 0.2 micron and over. They are currently studying the 
alterations of the solid after impact. 
  According to researchers, these results open new prospects: 
"Energies of the order of one gigaelectronvolts could be reached 
with other sources, multicharged molecular ions (with masses of 
100,000 and 100 positive charges) for instance, and transferred 
under a very small volume during a single collision and in 
10[.sup]-13[/] seconds."

<F P=106> [Report signed L.M.: "TAB Adapted for Use in Small Batch </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] Are electronic systems manufacturers interested in 
the development in France of a TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) 
process for assembling bare chips onto tape? Asked in a survey 
that could lead to the creation of a company within two years, 
this question again seems reasonable given the launch of the 
market in multichip modules (MCM's) which consist of several 
very complex bare chips assembled onto the same substrate (for 
use in military, aeronautical, computing, and telecommunication 
applications). 
<H5>  Chips on Tape More Reliable </H5>
  Chips mounted on tape can be tested before they are 
assembled 
in the module and thus, even in short production runs, present a 
considerable financial advantage over bare chips connected by 
wires or beads (flip-chips) whose faults can only be detected 
after assembly. According to certain experts, tests on modules 
containing the most complex chips can result in a reject rate of 
up to 30 percent. For complex MCM's, assembling the chips onto 
tape also has the advantage of reducing the limitations placed 
on the connection pitch by the wire method (currently used for 
most applications) and without seriously affecting the chip 
design. Karel Kurzweil, in charge of microassembly technologies 
at Bull, explains: "The dimples for the connection of the chips 
on the tape are in the same locations as the pins for wire 
soldering, whereas bead connection over the whole area of the 
chip means that designers have to redefine the entire mounting 
process." Until now, and despite these advantages, the 
manufacturers of sophisticated electronic systems have snubbed 
TAB technology. Tape-mounted chips require expertise in a large 
number of manufacturing processes (tape preparation, putting the 
dimples on the wafers, mounting the chips on the tape, and 
assembling the TAB chips on the substrate) and thus require 
large scale manufacture to amortize all the machinery needed. 
The difference between the requirements of potential users and 
the requirements of TAB technology therefore dissuaded many 
outfitters. It is probable, on the other hand, that the creation 
of a more flexible structure, such as that envisaged by the 
general arms directorate [DGA], which would handle the assembly 
of chips on tape at a reasonable cost even for small and medium 
production runs, would interest MCM manufacturers. 
  The participants in the DGA's project know that the cost of 
the service proposed will be the decisive factor. Mr. Kurzweil, 
the Bull representative in the DGA project, said: "In the TAB 
process, the large number of tools needed to produce the tape is 
one of the drawbacks of the technology for short production 
runs. You should reckon on between 30,000 to 80,000 French 
francs-worth [Fr] of equipment for each production series." 
However, he assured us: "We are currently trying to reduce 
these costs." 
<H5>  Will Euro-TAB Packaging Become a Reality? </H5>
  Dassault Electronique and Bull have been commissioned by the 
DGA's electronics and computing technical department [STEI] to 
study the contribution that could be made by TAB technology to 
military electronic systems. The two microelectronics 
specialists, assisted by other partners in the fields of silicon 
and tape, will have to produce prototypes to prove the economic 
viability of this type of component. At the same time, the STEI 
has surveyed potential users (military and civil) to determine 
what their future requirements in terms of TAB components will 
be. The results of the survey will be published in the second 
quarter of this year. According to Roland Even, manager of the 
STEI project, between Fr5 million and Fr10 million will be 
invested in these studies. If the results of these evaluations 
and the survey are favorable, an industrial structure, 
christened Euro TAB packaging could be created within two years. 
It will specialize in the supply of tape bonded chips to civil 
and military outfitters for small and medium-term production 
runs. The structure will in particular take charge of tape 
design and control, the production of the dimpling on the 
silicon wafers, the assembly of the chips on the tape, and their 
testing and burn-in. Systems manufacturers will then be 
responsible for assembling the chips onto the substrate. Roland 
Even was reluctant to disclose precise details of how this 
potential company will be structured financially, but he said 
that it will accept production runs ranging from just a few 
chips to several thousand, and will initially employ several 
dozen people.

<F P=106> [Report signed S.D.: "Rapid ASIC Prototyping for Signal </F>
Processing"] 
  [Text] Automatic tools for generating hardware and software 
prototypes for the emulation of specific circuits -- in other 
words, "virtual" ASIC's [Application Specific Integrated 
Circuit] -- are a relatively recent invention. Quickturn Systems 
and PiE Design Systems which have now joined forces under the 
name Quickturn Design Systems, have led the way in this field. 
The British company Inca (purchased last year by Zycad) has 
turned the spotlight on digital signal processing applications. 
Last year at the American DAC show it presented the initial 
results of its work in the development of systems based on 
digital signal processors (DSP's) carried out in the context of 
the European ESPRIT project (footnote 1) (The Retides project. 
Other participants include Philips, Thomson, EDC/Mentor 
Graphics, and the Catholic University of Louvain). Continuing 
with this line of work, Zycad is now bringing to market a family 
of solutions for the rapid prototyping of specific applications, 
christened Paradigm RP. The first model in this family is aimed 
at DSP-based designs. This solution therefore makes it possible 
to test complex designs based on DSP's even before they are 
implanted onto silicon. These designs have a degree of 
complexity ranging from 30,000 to 120,000 gates or more and 
clock speeds in excess of 10 MHz (usually from eight to 15 MHz, 
although 20 MHz may be possible in some cases). 
<H5>  Emulation Based on FPGA's [Fixed Programmable Gate Arrays] </H5>
  The Paradigm RP consists of a software component and a 
hardware component. The software component is used to draw, 
partition, compile, check, and debug a logical circuit on a 
predefined and modular programmable hardware architecture. This 
hardware component is built around an emulation mother board 
containing the equivalent of 30,000 gates in the form of Xilinx 
4010-type programmable gate arrays. Interchangeable daughter 
boards can be connected to the main module, enabling 
combinations of FPGA's, RAM, ROM, DSP's, and DSP cores and 
forming a part of the emulated system. The company says that it 
will support a range of daughter boards to cover all of the most 
common DSP applications. 
  Zycad is banking on this product to quickly take shares in 
this rapidly expanding market for DSP applications, more 
precisely in a segment of the DSP market that the American 
consultancy Forward Concepts calls FASIC (Function and Algorithm 
Specific IC) and estimated to be worth $1.2 billion in 1994 and 
$3 billion by 1997. In addition, Zycad specializes in logical 
simulation accelerators, fault simulation, and VHDL [Very High 
Description Language] simulation.

<F P=106> [Article by Franz Frisch: "6,000 Rpm in a Grain of Rice: A </F>
2-mm Motor Goes Into Series Production -- Leading-Edge 
Technology from Mainz"] 
  [Text] The engine has been running continuously for weeks 
as a fatigue test, its rotor making 6,000 revolutions per 
minute. What is so special about it is that it has a diameter 
of only 2 mm, the size of a grain of rice. It is to be launched 
in 1994 as the world's first electric motor manufactured using 
modern microengineering techniques to come onto the market. 
  Silicon chips first fired information technology, and now 
miniaturization is also moving into conventional fields such as 
mechanical and electrical engineering and metrology. 
  Contrary to what has happened in microelectronics, Europe 
still has its nose out in front in this technology of the 
future, which makes it possible to produce a vast range of 
microscopic components. Over the last 15 years, its inventor, 
Professor Wolfgang Ehrfeld, has been granted about 50 patents 
for what is known as the LIGA (standing, in German, for 
lithography, electroplating, and molding) process. 
  The first micromechanical motor thus comes not from Boston 
or 
Tokyo, but from Mainz, where Ehrfeld set up the Institute of 
Microengineering (IMM), a 120-strong research corporation 
sponsored by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate, in 1991. 
  Like semiconductor chip circuits, these mini-components are 
first designed in large scale then projected onto the material 
in an extremely reduced scale. The three-dimensional structures 
formed by exposure to parallel x-rays, which are now available 
worldwide in synchrotron centers (such as DESY [German Electron 
Synchrotron] in Hamburg). 
  Simple micromechanical products are already in industrial 
use: Ehrfeld, who first worked at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research 
Center, began setting up the microengineering division at the 
STEAG AG group in 1988. In 1990, this division turned into the 
Dortmund company, Micro-Parts, which now has 60 employees and 
exports microtechnology -- to Japan as well. Outstanding 
examples are its perfectly formed nozzles with diameters ranging 
from 20 to 100 micrometers for inkjet printers. 
  The IMM in Mainz goes for more complex applications ranging 
from a plug for optical communication systems that is only 1 
centimeter wide, is easily inserted, and accurately connects 12 
ultrathin glass fibers on 1 micrometer, to a device the size of 
a cigarette packet for measuring thin films on chips. 
Electronic circuits can even be conjured onto mini-components 
made of silicon. 
  The demand for microtechnology solutions, which are on 
average 100 times smaller than their conventional counterparts, 
is showing a marked increase: Joint projects with industry in 
Mainz rose from 11 to 45 in 1993 alone. 
  Over the three years of the IMM's life to date, Ehrfeld has 
consolidated its leading position. For example, he has managed 
to raise the surface quality of ceramic microstructures 100-fold 
(previous roughness: 3 micrometers, compared with Ehrfeld's 
current 30 nanometers). Gold-coated diamond membranes give 
unprecedented precision for x-ray masks -- the negatives for 
lithography. Jena-based Jenoptik GmbH and the IMM have jointly 
developed an automated machine for producing LIGA structures, 
the first two models of which have been sold to France and the 
United States. 
  As the head of the IMM is aware that the technological lead 
that it has acquired over the United States and the Far East can 
only be maintained if research and development reach critical 
mass, he has established a European network of firms and 
research institutes in 12 European countries. The EU [European 
Union] has awarded this joint project a grant of approximately 
3.5 million German marks.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Alfred Felder and his 
colleagues have developed a fast chip that breaks the 
microelectronics sound barrier: Their silicon chip, which 
measures less than a square millimeter, can process 40 billion 
bits per second, the quantity of data that would be generated if 
each of the million-plus inhabitants of a city the size of 
Munich were to make phone calls simultaneously. The Siemens 
researchers have set a world record with their 40 
Gigabit-per-second microchip: It had previously been considered 
impossible for a silicon-based circuit to reach processing 
speeds of this magnitude, with the result that many 
manufacturers had turned to gallium arsenide, which is costlier 
and more complicated to work with. Three different processes, 
applied to the best advantage, brought about this success: 
transistor technology, circuit design, and metrology. The 
latest production methods give controlled deposition of 
extremely thin films precisely where required. Single-crystal 
semiconductor and insulating films 1 billionth of a millimeter 
thick can be accurately positioned using this process, which 
goes hand in hand with transistor technology developments that 
create high-performance, purpose-structured transistors by 
depositing microscopically thin semiconductor materials. The 
transistor technology is complemented by an optimized circuit: 
"We did not have to reinvent the wheel by any means, as the 
circuitry principles are not new, but we succeeded in scaling 
and arranging the components in such a way as to achieve maximum 
performance," says Felder. 
  The scientist, who received the 20,000-German mark Philipp 
Reis Prize for his work, took advantage of his know-how as a 
qualified high-frequency engineer when developing his high-speed 
circuit technology. "There are technical sound barriers that 
you have to know. Once you exceed speeds of a few Gigahertz, 
the structural and measuring techniques have a major impact," he 
explains. 
  The chip is still a prototype and is only a part of the 
complete 40-Gigabit transmission system. Felder and his 
colleagues are continuing work on the other key electronic 
components required for data rates of this magnitude. These 
include circuits capable of converting parallel data stream 
inputs into a serial data stream. These "multiplex circuits" are 
a must for feeding large volumes of data into a glass fiber 
cable. 
  There are already trial glass fiber network lines capable of 
transmitting 10 billion bits per second. The expansion of these 
networks renders high-performance circuits in the switching 
stations indispensable. The Siemens researchers expect an early 
breakthrough for ultra-high-speed transmission technology, 
particularly in data systems and communications. 
  This means that future circuits and integrated network 
concepts will have to handle billions of bits per second if they 
are to be able to transmit this data together -- for 
high-definition television, digital radio, and mobile phones, 
for instance.

  Text] Invigorated from Crisis 
  Electronics specialists from East Germany appear at the 
PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition with renewed self-esteem. While two 
years ago they needed only one common display booth, there are 
now already 15 exhibitors in Munich. 
  "It required a great effort to gain a foothold on the 
market" explains marketing manager Ingo Reichel. A little luck 
played its role too: In 1991, just during the confusion in the 
aftermath of the turning-point events, the West European 
manufacturer of GaAs single crystals Wacker closed shop. 
  This did not help the people in Saxony much at first, their 
enterprise still being held in trust. "Had we been so far 
advanced then as we are today, we certainly would have been able 
to take over the customers by following target-oriented 
marketing procedures" assesses Reichel. As it was, however, the 
competition in Southeast Asia snatched the customers away from 
us with lightning speed. "Today we must spare no effort to win 
these customers back." 
  At the PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition the Elektonikwerkstoffe 
(Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg displays single-crystal 
silicon blocks and slices for photovoltaic cells and electronic 
devices, also GaAs slices for microwave components and for 
low-power components. This enterprise has developed and made 
specialty materials for over the past 35 years. As always, in 
keeping up with developments in electronics, these materials 
today are silicon and gallium arsenide. 
  Also Lothar Spaeth of Jenoptik Ltd is now in Munich. 
Evolving 
from the former Carl Zeiss combine in Jena, this company could 
have afforded to send a representative to the previous 1991 
PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition already. Spaeth wants to enter not only 
the European market but also the U.S.A. and Southeast Asia. With 
a staff of 1,250 highly qualified employees, the enterprise is 
active in many business areas: microelectronics, sensors, 
heavy-duty optics, and precision mechanics. 
  One strength of Jenoptik is development and production of 
equipment for the semiconductor industry: electron-beam lighting 
apparatus, wafer steppers, fine-structure forming apparatus for 
printed-circuit boards and handling systems, also for measuring 
and inspection devices. 
  The Jena people are exhibiting in Munich three innovative 
developments. The DirectPrint 40 is a laser-type direct-lighting 
apparatus for printed-circuit boards. It facilitates formation 
of fine structures having an only 40 m track width on a 
printed-circuit board. A minifacility for fabrication under 
Class 1 clean-room conditions is hidden behind the SMIF Lean 
Robot SLR 150 AF exhibit. The third novelty is the DefectFinder 
2000, a wafer inspecting device with which slicing processes can 
be automatically monitored. 
  Now, for the first time, the FHR Anlagenbau (Equipment 
Construction) enterprise, in existence since 1991, represented 
in the very traditional Apparatus Construction Post Dresden. 
This enterprise evolved from the Elektromat enterprise. The 
staff brought with it many years of experience in development 
and construction of equipment for vacuum and film deposition 
processes. With this asset, it should be possible to increase 
the net output from 1.2 million DM in 1992 to 2 million DM in 
this year already. 
  The enterprise does not only develop equipment and devices 
but also takes over services from and handles products of 
prominent European manufactures. Its current principal area of 
activity is environment-friendly treatment, modification, and 
cleaning of surfaces by plasma and vacuum processes. A 
large-surface sputtering apparatus makes it possible to coat 
most diverse target surfaces of all materials currently in use. 
A whole selection will be shown in Munich. 
  The Feutron Ltd in Greiz (Vogtland in Thuringia), for over 
50 
years a specialist in refrigeration, climate, and environment 
simulation engineering, has already installed about 15,000 
climatic test chambers all over Europe. It holds 50 relevant 
patents. This company will demonstrate in Munich how it reacted 
to the collapse of ancestral eastern markets by modernizing and 
shaping up its product line so that now its specialties are: 
custom-built high-tech equipment for simulation of 
characteristics of the environment, complete transportable 
climatic test laboratories, and outdoor measuring stations.

  [Text] SUCCESS WITH INNOVATIONS 
  A message of top significance almost drowned in the general 
lamentation about the future of Germany's industrial status: At 
the end of September 1993 IBM and Siemens exhibited their first 
working samples of the first in the world 64 Mbit chip! Other 
German companies are exhibiting alongside Siemens: only by way 
of innovations in the "high-tech" technologies can the crisis be 
overcome with invigoration. Several items in the area of 
electronics manufacture which demonstrate this are displayed at 
the 9-13 Nov 1993 PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition in Munich, but is 
this enough? 
  Since 1990 have Siemens and IBM been working in expectation 
of this day. As to the public response to their success, 
managers and developers have indeed been more than disappointed. 
Hardly anyone seemed to take notice when at the end of September 
the first in the world 64 Mbit chip was shown. The newspaper 
BERLINER ZEITUNG found this event to be worthy of only three 
full lines in the WIRTSCHAFT (Economy) Section. 
  Some samples had already been previously distributed among 
select customers. The size of a single chip is 10.7x18.1 
mm[.sup]2[/]. The finest DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) 
structures, only 0.35 m wide, had been produced by the 
photolithographic process in far-ultraviolet light. 
  Because of the most readily achievable symmetric and regular 
DRAM structure, production of this type of memory is so 
important to a semiconductor manufacturer that methods of 
producing ever finer such structures are being explored and 
developed for such memories. This type of memory is, in effect, 
the stimulator of technological innovations in microelectronics. 
  With this chip, a German enterprise has finally knocked the 
Japanese and the North Americans hard in the key technology 
dominated by them. What the significance of this success will be 
in the long run remains to be seen. Meanwhile, a 256 Mbit chip 
is already being worked on by Siemens together with IBM and 
Toshiba. 
  This example indicates that there are some German 
enterprises 
which do not participate in general wailing about the recession 
but rather channel their strengths toward a leading position in 
the field of electronics. They are pursuing their chances 
particularly in specialty sectors of the market. 
  In electronics processing technology and production 
facilities, strongly emphasized at the PRODUCTRONICA, overseas 
competition is certainly still ahead. But even overseas 
innovations have helped German enterprises find a few niches. An 
example is the new LA 440 S sputtering apparatus, a joint 
development by the Von Ardenne Anlagentechnik (Equipment 
Engineering) Ltd in Dresden and the Balzers Hochvakuum (High 
Vacuum) Ltd in Wiesbaden. This apparatus facilitates deposition 
of thin films on wafers. It can be easily re-equipped to suit 
most diverse technological processes and sputtering methods, 
which is ideal for research and development. It demonstrates a 
high potential for electronics and machine manufacture in West 
and East Germany. 
  Another example is the Karl Kuess Ltd in Garching, worldwide 
leader in manufacture of x-ray stepper drives. They are used for 
x-ray lithography, a method of most highly integrated microchip 
structurization. This company has found a market in the U.S.A., 
since hardly any x-ray lithography is being done in Europe. 
  Recently Jenoptik is competing with its x-ray lithographic 
equipment against Karl Kuess in that overseas market. Its new 
X-Ray Scanner has attracted worldwide attention of professionals 
in this field. 
  Germany is also strong in communications engineering: 
Siemens, still the world master of innovations, has cropped a 
winner with its ATM (Asynchron Transfer Modus). This is a 
multiplexing and exchange system for the future broad-band 
telephone network. While synthesizing and standardizing this 
system, Siemens has simultaneously developed the now classical 
technology based on use of ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated 
Circuits); just as it did for the GSM mobile radio system and 
for the cordless telephone in the DECT Standard. 
  New developments are budding even in East Germany, where the 
electronic industry sector quickly collapsed after having been 
previously subsidized while cut off from the international 
market. A scientific and technical potential is still to be 
found here: LSI Logik in Erfurt, VLSI Technologie in Dresden, 
Elektronikwerkstoffe (Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg, 
Jenoptik in Jena, and many smaller candidates for niche 
positions in the market are vying for them. 
  In Soemmerda (Thuringia), where once the Robotron combine 
was 
manufacturing office machines, Germany's most modern computer 
factory is now in place and production has resumed beginning 
last October. In this new plant the ASI Computer Ltd will employ 
about 600 workers and produce at least 300,000 personal 
computers annually, which will make this enterprise Europe's 
largest PC producer. By manufacturing them in Germany, 
management hopes to respond faster to a fluctuating market 
demand and to thus extract pricing advantages better than is 
possible with imports from the Far East. 
  Take the Electronic Materials Ltd in Freiberg, the sole 
manufacturer of GaAs single crystals in Europe. After the West 
German previous manufacturer Wacker had closed shop, the 
Freiberg company was able to take over its European customers 
despite a few initial difficulties. 
  However, top-notch German electronic specialists are rather 
an exception: "There are no white elephants among the electronic 
companies" deplores Tom Sommerlatte. At the end of last October 
the Arthur D. Little consulting team had concluded its 
investigation of German companies. The objective was to identify 
those which had in the past three years, despite crisis and 
recession, realized above average output and profit gains. The 
list includes quite a few well managed medium-size industries, 
but no electronic companies. 
  By the way, Sommerlatte has nothing particularly good to say 
about the German economy anyhow. The enterprises, he claims, are 
far too frozen into their old business molds and originate very 
little innovation. 
  The Federal Republic is a land deficient in raw materials, 
which the Research Minister Paul Krueger is quite aware of. 
Therefore, it can retain its position as a leading industrial 
country only by top performance technologically and not being 
last in the field of electronics. Its only chance is investment 
in intelligence and creativity. 
  Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the Bavarian VDMA [Verein fuer 
Deutschen 
Maschinenbau und Anlagenbau = German Machinery and Equipment 
Construction Society] agrees with the Research Minister on this 
point. But on the foreground of PRODUCTRONICA '93 he has also 
accused the intolerable power wrangle in Bonn of being 
responsible for the fact that future-oriented decisions made 
regarding Germany's research and industrial status are 
exceptions rather than the rule. 
  "Discussion about the status, though certainly needed, are 
missing the main point" believes Dr. Ekkehard Suess, chairman of 
the Productronic technical group within the VDMA. He demands 
more recognition for technical science, because it is the source 
of prosperity and jobs. "It is even helpful in protecting the 
environment" he said when addressing the PRODUCTRONICA '93 in 
Munich. 
  In the long run, Doctor Suess warns, "Germany will not be 
able to keep up with the international competition if chip 
production is left more or less to the Siemens company alone." 
For this key product line competition in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, 
and now also in China is being backed by the "entire government 
machinery." Poor Germany! 
  Industrial manager Suess calls it outright pure nonsense 
that 
ensuring and promoting microelectronics production be entrusted 
to the Ministry of Research, already burdened by shortage of 
funds, instead of also involving the Ministry of Economy. As far 
as the Research Minister Paul Krueger is concerned, Ekkerhard 
Suess crashes open doors. The minister wants to focus his policy 
on "the new technologies which have good chances both 
economically and technically" so that the results of research 
can be faster converted into competitive products and processes. 
A top product line under consideration for the next ten years is 
electronics. 
  In order to push this through, Paul Krueger had formed a 
strategizing team which held its first meeting last September. 
Its task is to set in motion the needed dialog between 
scientists, economists, and politicians. Members of this team 
include Hubert Markl (former president of the German Research 
Society), Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker (director of the GenCenter), 
Heinrich von Pierer (on Siemens board of director), Edzard 
Reuter (on the Daimler-Benz board of directors), and Lothar 
Spaeth (business manager of Jenoptik). Krueger's model is 
Japan's innovation model. Eventually he will also bring about a 
general consensus in Germany. 
  The BMFT (Federal Ministry of Research and Technology) has 
just pushed through a project involving effective division of 
tasks between the Government and economic management, namely 
promotion of the Laser 2000 concept. As a part of this project 
there have been set up and are being tracked five sub-projects, 
with diverse objectives ranging from heavy-duty diode lasers to 
medical instruments.

<F P=106> [Article by Anne Lombard: "Chlorine Regulated At the Faucet"] </F>
  [Text] The Lyonnaise des Eaux [water company of Lyon] 
and SAGEP [water company of Paris] are validating the first 
installation of electrochemical microsensors--amperometric cells 
costing less than 10 francs[Fr] each--to regulate the chlorine 
in potable water. 
  Since chlorine must be used to purify potable water, sensors 
are needed to verify that the chlorine content is neither too 
high nor too low. The question is at one and the same time a 
legal one (0.1 mg/l of admissible residual chlorine), one of 
prevention (kill the bacteria without poisoning the drinker), 
and one of comfort (ugh! the horrible taste of javel water!). 
The answer? Regulate the dosage continuously and in real time. 
Drawn by the technology of chemical microsensors, Sagep, 
Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Parisienne des Eaux, have recently 
achieved the first chlorine amperometric microsensor for use in 
water. Apic Systeme, another subsidiary of the Lyonnaise 
company, together with Cylergie, a GIE [economic interest group] 
subsidiary of the Lyonnaise des Eaux, and the Swiss Microsens 
company, developed the measurement operating software. The 
project required three engineer-years and an investment of Fr1 
million a year over a period of two years. Several pilot 
installations, each equipped with some 15 sensors, are 
undergoing validation in Paris and in the regions. 
<H5>  Enhanced Reliability </H5>
  Manufactured as an electronics component, hence 
mass-produced, each amperometric cell will cost around 10 
francs. At this price, it will be feasible to multiply the 
number of cells and to effect measurements on a continuous 
scale, in real time (the response time of the sensor is less 
than a minute), and with reliability enhanced by multiplying the 
number of measurement points. By means of these tiny throw-away 
chips (they are 1.5 mm thick, 4 mm wide, and have a life of six 
months), the chlorine will be regulated... at the consumer's 
faucet! By way of comparison, the macrosensors used, one at the 
output of a water treatment plant, and one at the input to the 
distribution network, cost Fr60,000 each. They require bimonthly 
maintenance. The microsensor requires none. The Lyonnaise 
company will market the method both by sale of the cell to other 
water companies, and in the form of a "pen" for spot-testing 
samples. The company is conducting research in the direction of 
bacteriological detection.

<F P=106> [Article by Thierry Lucas: "From the Cire group: Printed </F>
Circuits that Diffuse Heat"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE 
introduction] 
  [Text] A new metal-base substrate quite suitable for power 
electronics is currently being tested at Peugeot. It could also 
be used in telecommunications. 
Multiplexing considerably simplifies the electric wiring of 
vehicles, but it requires the development of very specific 
technologies. In particular, the printed circuit--the substrate 
of electronic component interconnections--must possess three 
qualities: good dissipation of the heat produced by power 
components, small overall dimensions, and both at an affordable 
price. The SMI (insulated metallic substrate) developed jointly 
with Peugeot by BREE (a subsidiary of the Cire group) meets 
these criteria. A preseries designed for use on 1,000 XM 
vehicles is being manufactured; it will be used to test the new 
process on a quasi-industrial scale. 
  The most original feature of SMI printed circuits is that 
they use a metallic base instead of the standard glass-epoxy 
material. Actually, the circuit is built on an aluminum foil no 
more than 3 mm thick, which is covered with an insulating layer 
on which the copper conducting plate is pressed. Additional 
conducting layers can be obtained by using silver or 
copper-based polymer pastes. When the circuit is equipped with 
its components and mounted in the car, therefore, the heat it 
produces can diffuse into the metallic substrate and from there 
into the car body. This is an efficient solution that does not 
require adding a heat sink on the circuit--the usual method to 
improve heat dissipation in power circuits. According to Pascal 
Poisson, the BREE manager, the savings achieved by not having to 
purchase and install these heat sinks should offset the 
additional cost of the metallic substrate, so that the cost of 
the product would be about the same as that of a traditional 
circuit. 
  Industrializing the SMI process required the development of 
adequate production means. In particular, since aluminum foil is 
a malleable material it cannot be machined with the equipment 
traditionally used in making printed circuits. The metallic 
plates must therefore be drilled, cut, and scribed with special 
tools developed by BREE. 
  The conveying and loading/unloading systems were also 
modified to accommodate the new substrate, which is heavier than 
traditional substrates. 
  A total of 1 million francs was invested in preseries 
production facilities. The Peugeot group's certification of the 
insulated metallic substrate already created considerable 
interest from other potential clients (in telecommunications). 
They are waiting for the first results of the full-scale test 
performed on the 1,000 XM vehicles which, according to BREE, 
might warrant going on to mass production.

<H3>  Europe's Semiconductor Industry is Finally Holding a Trump 
Card: The Chip Card. </H3>
  "I'm going to buy some bread," calls the five-year-old to 
his 
mother on Saturday morning. She replies, "OK, but don't forget 
the chip card." Benjamin routinely pays the baker with the card. 
  "Where did you last see a doctor?" asks the physician in 
Munich. He is talking to the tourist from Hamburg who is having 
heart trouble. Instead of answering, the patient inserts the 
medical insurance record chip card into the physician's 
computer, releases the data stored in the chip using his 
personal identification number, and allows the doctor to read 
the patient's history. 
  "Please insert your chip card," requests the screen of the 
new arrival. Only after comparing the typed code with the code 
stored on the chip card does the computer network become enabled 
for the user. 
  Paying, storing, unlocking. The variety of applications of 
the plastic card is virtually inexhaustible thanks to the 
integrated chip that may contain a complete minicomputer. The 
handy medium is opening completely new possibilities of drumming 
up customers primarily for the service branch. "The present 
applications are just scratching the surface," says 
Hans-Dietrich Kreft. He is the managing director of Angewandte 
Digital Elektronik (ADE) from Dassendorf in North Germany. Kreft 
is one of the most committed trail blazers of the chip-card 
technology. The untiring promoter was among the winners in 1987 
of the innovation prize of the German economy. Today, he can be 
certain that the chip card is conquering the world with mass 
applications. 
  The Europeans, in particular the French and Germans, are the 
front runners. They have an important advantage, "the larger 
domestic market," says Winfried Gaal. He is the product manager 
at Giesecke &amp; Devrient (G&amp;D), a chip-card manufacturer 
in Munich. 
  After successfully introducing the phonecard, the Germans 
are 
now reaching for the chip twice with the medical-insurance chip 
card and a new Euroscheck [check guarantee] chip card. While the 
electronic substitute for the medical insurance record card will 
be introduced starting on the first of January 1994, the new 
'ec' chip card will presumably be available in 1995, according 
to information from the banking branch. About 120 million chip 
cards will be necessary just for these two applications. 
  The European electronics industry, which has not exactly 
been 
spoiled, is the beneficiary. "The chip card can become a new 
pillar for the European semiconductor industry," predicts Ulrich 
Hamann. He is the director of marketing for chip-card ICs at 
Siemens AG. 
  Besides Motorola as the only non-European, just Siemens, 
Bull, SGS-Thomson and Philips possess the necessary know-how and 
fabrication capacities at this time. Due to this, the ranking of 
vendors is unusual for electronics conditions. With 30 per cent 
of the market, both Siemens and Motorola are running neck and 
neck, followed by SGS-Thomson and Philips. Hitachi appears in 
fifth place as the first Japanese chip manufacturer. It has a 
skimpy six per cent of the market. The Europeans have fallen by 
the wayside in the triad competition. However, they may be able 
to experience another success story with the chip card similar 
to that for the GSM standard for cellular telephones. This has 
proven to be an export hit. 
  In any case, the timing of the market introduction is 
perfect. The insurance card does not appear to make sense at 
first glance because the potential of the chip is not fully 
exploited. Only the data present on the medical insurance record 
card are stored. The physician prints out a standardized form 
with these data and continues to handwrite his services on this 
form. However, this is just what the semiconductor manufacturers 
want. On the one hand, "Using these relatively simple chips, we 
can learn how to stabilize our production process," according to 
the Siemens expert Hamann. On the other hand, the corresponding 
readers and physician's computers will create an infrastructure 
that will subsequently enable the use of more demanding chip 
cards. 
  Consequently, the big bang in the card industry is set. 
Market surveys by Siemens claim that the world market for the 
chips the size of a finger nail will grow from 160 million marks 
last year to almost 1,000 million marks in 1997. Of this amount, 
the German chip manufacturer wants half. Axel Hartstang is the 
managing director of the German subsidiary of Motorola. He 
expects that sales of less than 50 million cards currently will 
grow almost ten times to more than 400 million within five years. 
  In this respect, the chips are only a fraction of the 
business. They must be integrated into the card and personalized 
for the individual user by special service providers. For image 
reasons, marketing strategies allow the plastic substrate to 
accept high-quality printing. In addition, the system operates 
only with readers. 
  With the domestic market and technical lead, the Europeans 
have the best chance of dominating the world market over the 
long term. Card producers such as G&amp;D, Orga Kartensysteme, 
Oldenburg, Gemplus and Schlumberger are already supplying their 
products to the burgeoning markets in Australia, Brazil, South 
Africa and Hong Kong. Success is beckoning Siemens even into the 
lion's den. The conglomerate from Munich is on the verge of 
completing deals with Dai Nippon Printing and Toppan, two of the 
largest printing firms in the world. The company from Munich is 
to supply chips to Japan. The chips will be installed in cards 
there. 
  The Europeans have also been working flat out on chips that 
offer processors and complex operating systems (so-called 
controllers). Courageously, they are now defying Motorola, the 
vendor previously dominant in this sector. These open systems 
form the prerequisite for so-called multifunctional cards. Such 
cards allow not only one special application but can even be 
equipped with new functions later. 
  Consequently, according to the plans of the Central Credit 
Committee (ZKA), the owners of the new 'ec' cards will not just 
be able to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines and make 
telephone calls. These cards will also function as electronic 
wallets. To allow for the transfer of small amount such as 
paying for bread, the chips are loaded with specific sums which 
can be paid out little by little. For larger amounts, a credit 
line is stored on the card. Even the primitive medical insurance 
chip card will be extended to a comprehensive patient card over 
the long term. Then, it will store data regarding accidents and 
portions of the medical history in addition to management 
specifications. 
  Such multifunctional cards could also work as tickets for 
buses and trains. While buying the correct ticket at an automat 
is more of a game of chance today--primarily in strange 
cities--the electronics does everything for the user of the chip 
card. "Because of this, we are hoping to reduce the inhibition 
threshold and get more customers to use public transportation," 
says Achim Muller. He is the managing director and consultant 
for the cities of Luneburg and Oldenburg. 
  Without having to study any sort of schedule, the rider 
inserts his card into a reader when entering and exiting. The 
central computer can then not only determine the cheapest fare. 
Frequent riders also get a discount. In Luneburg, no rider pays 
more within 30 days than the price of a monthly ticket.

<F P=106> [Article by TAR: "DRAM Chip With Trench Cells"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt--IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba want to use a 
trench-cell structure in developing their common 256-megabit 
DRAM memory chip. This structure was recently presented on the 
occasion of the International Electron Devices meeting of 
experts in this field in Washington. What is involved is a 
self-aligned trench-circuit contact which is defined by the 
intersection of a deep trench-memory node and the "shallow" 
trench insulation. As described in the journal SEMICONDUCTOR 
INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 16, 1993, No. 12, p 18), the trench cell, a 
"buried" strip, is 0.55 x 1.1 micrometers in size. It is 
produced with the aid of the 0.25-micrometer technique. The cell 
surface is claimed to be only 0.1 of a square micrometer larger 
than the theoretical minimal surface of such a cell and the 
smallest of the folded bit-circuit cells that have been 
proposed. It differs considerably from Mitsubishi's 
planar-stacked capacitor-cell design, which was also reported on 
at the Washington conference. The superdielectric, constant 
barium-strontium-titanate film was also discussed.

<F P=106> [Article: "Revolutionary Nuclear Reactor Proposed by CERN </F>
Director"] 
  [Text] Geneva--Nuclear generating plants powered by an 
inexhaustible energy source that is also virtually risk-free and 
poses no military proliferation threat: This is the 
revolutionary project unveiled on 24 November in Geneva to some 
500 physicists from all over the world by Professor Carlo 
Rubbia, director of the European Particle Physics Laboratory 
(CERN). 
  Speaking in CERN's crowded amphitheater, the Nobel 
Prize-winning physicist explained that ecological concerns had 
motivated his conception of this project, which builds on 
earlier work and consists essentially of an "energy amplifier" 
driven by a heat-producing particle accelerator. In other words, 
the project consists of "extracting energy from heavy nuclei 
with the help of nuclear cascades induced by an accelerator." 
One might even go so far as to envision an "upsurge in global 
demand for nuclear energy to replace fossil fuels" such as 
hydrocarbons that engender so-called "greenhouse gases" and 
contribute to warming of the earth's atmosphere. 
  According to Mr. Rubbia, the particle amplifier, which would 
use thorium (abundantly available) rather than uranium as fuel, 
represents a safer solution because the reactor would be 
"subcritical" and there would be no danger of chain reaction. 
  Mr. Rubbia noted the general public's misgivings about 
traditional nuclear reactors in light of accidents such as Three 
Mile Island and Chernobyl and the need to bury highly 
radioactive waste products for very long periods of time. Use of 
thorium in this way would offer the advantages of "being simple, 
safe, cleaner, not posing any important technological hurdles, 
nonproliferating, and inexhaustible," Professor Rubbia said. 
Small plants would produce virtually no plutonium, and "no one 
could make a bomb with it." But Professor Rubbia concluded on a 
warning note: The project is still at the stage of "virtual 
reality, and experimental verification will be required," along 
with very complex calculations, before the idea is implemented. 
  According to CERN spokesman Neil Calder, Mr. Rubbia has 
computer-tested his theory and plans to begin experimental work 
on it next year at CERN. Most of the physicists reacted 
positively to the proposal, Mr. Calder said. 
  In his presentation, the Nobel Prize-winner said his work 
was 
based on research done in the 1950s by W. Lewis (Canada) and 
more recently by Professor C. Bowman's team at Los Alamos (New 
Mexico). At the end of December, Mr. Rubbia will step down as 
director of CERN, which he has headed for the last 5 years, and 
will be replaced by Christopher Llewellyn Smith. He will then 
devote himself entirely to his energy project.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "LHC [Large Hadron Collider] Project </F>
Presented to CERN Council"] 
  [Text] Geneva--On 17 December, the board of the CERN 
[Nuclear Studies and Research Center] (the European Particle 
Physics Laboratory), which includes representatives of its 19 
member states, reviewed the final version (technical parameters 
and budget) of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) project which, if 
built, will be the most powerful particle physics facility in 
the world. 
  According to Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith 
(Great-Britain), who will succeed Professor Carlo Rubbia as CERN 
director on 1 January 1994, the cost of this giant proton-proton 
collider, which will be 10 times more powerful than the CERN's 
present electron-positron ring, the LEP (Large Electron-Positron 
Collider), is estimated at 2.23 billion Swiss francs (nearly 9 
billion French francs [Fr]). 
  If it is approved by the board during the first half of 1994 
(the decision should be made in April), construction of the LHC 
might start in 1995 and be completed in 2002. The expenditures 
concerning the project were included in the CERN 10-year plan 
for 1995-2005. Pr. Llewellyn Smith said that member states might 
increase their participation and mentioned the possibility of 
both intellectual and financial contributions from non-members, 
such as the United States now that the SSC [Superconducting 
Super-Collider] project has been abandoned, which "complicates 
the decision." 
  In fact, a few weeks ago, the U.S. Congress refused to go on 
with the construction of the SSC--a project similar to the LHC 
but still more gigantic and powerful--which was deemed too 
costly (total cost: about $11 billion). People in Geneva 
estimate that, as a result, "thousands of physicists, in 
particular U.S. physicists, will be tempted to come and work at 
the CERN" if the LHC is built. 
  France is in favor of building the collider, which will be 
set up above the LEP, in the 27-km-diameter ring under the 
French-Swiss border. Early in November, Russia expressed its 
intention to contribute to the construction. In addition, 
Switzerland recently announced that it would grant the CERN a 
loan of 34.4 million Swiss francs ($23 million) for the 
construction of a new building that might provide an additional 
876 work stations. 
  Every year, 6,000 scientists from all over the world 
(including already an increasing number of Americans) come to 
the CERN, which has a permanent staff of 3,000. For over 10 
years now, the CERN has been the leading particle physics 
laboratory in the world. Building the LHC would enable it to 
retain its rank and to make new discoveries, several of which 
have already been predicted by theoreticians, for instance that 
of Higgs' boson. 
  The CERN board also approved the laboratory's 1994 budget, 
which amounts to 924.1 million Swiss francs, compared with 
951.67 million Swiss francs in 1993.

"Karlsruhe Tritium Laboratory/Laboratory Studying the Fuel for 
an Energy Source for the Distant Future/Settling of Safety 
Problems. Fusion Research Has Supplanted the Fast Breeder"; 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, Wednesday, 1 Dec 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Now 
a tritium laboratory (TLK) has officially opened at the 
Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center. This is an experimentation 
facility by means of which nuclear researchers want to acquire 
precise information and working know-how in dealing with larger 
quantities of tritium--a necessary step toward the hoped-for 
commercial exploitation of nuclear fusion for the generation of 
electricity in the still distant future. 
  The acquisition of reliability and safety data have to have 
high priority here. Tritium, the heaviest of the three isotopes 
of hydrogen, along with deuterium (heavy hydrogen) is needed as 
fuel for plasma fusion reactors. Nuclear fusion--the fusion of 
light atomic nuclei and the atomic-energy-liberation process of 
the sun--is at some time to be utilized in fusion reactors on 
the earth for energy transformation and the generation of 
electricity. Therefore, TLK's specified tasks are dictated by 
the requirements of research and development work on fusion 
research. The nuclear research center is included with the 
fusion project in the European fusion technology program and in 
the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) 
reactor project. 
  With TLK the nuclear researchers in Karlsruhe have the first 
finished experimentation facility of this size for fusion 
research in Europe. As yet they have seen comparable facilities 
only in Los Alamos, USA and Tokaimura, Japan. The laboratory was 
built over a period of seven years with an investment of around 
45 million German marks [DM]. The state of 
Baden-Wurttemberg 
and the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology each 
absorbed in a special financing arrangement 50 percent of the 
costs incurred. The Nukem and Siemens companies were appointed 
as general engineers by the nuclear research center for 
construction of the laboratory. 
  The laboratory was built in the same building in which a 
breeder test stand was built in the seventies. This demonstrates 
the change in KfK's [Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center's] 
scientific-technical problem range and the reconstruction of its 
infrastructure and experimentation facilities. Working with the 
lightest elements, the isotopes of hydrogen, is being practiced 
today in the same room in which years ago heavy elements like 
uranium and plutonium were dealt with. 
  Radioactive tritium has a (relatively short) half-life of 
12.3 years, but at the same time high diffusibility through 
other materials. The researchers want to achieve the safe 
handling of this hydrogen gas by means of a multiple barrier 
system. This consists of the metal walls of the equipment and 
pipes in which the gas is handled. In addition, all the 
apparatus is enclosed by a secondary system with glove boxes, a 
sub-atmospheric-pressure maintenance system, and tritium hold-up. 
<H3>  Development Work for Protection of Personnel and the 
Environment </H3>
  The building itself constitutes the third barrier. Its 
exhaust air is constantly monitored. Not only will the 
feasibility in principle of the occurrence on just the earth of 
the fusion process that takes place in the sun be decided one 
day by the realization of this process in a reactor, but also 
the solution of as yet less discussed safety problems in the 
protection of personnel and the environment. 
  As a priority, chemical and process engineering problems 
relating to cleaning the fusion reactor fuel mixture will be 
worked on within TLK's range of tasks--like, for example, the 
removal of impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen. Uranium, 
which combines tritium in the form of uranium tritide (a stable 
uranium-hydrogen compound) acts as a storage medium. The tritium 
can be set free again by heating up this storage medium, and the 
tritium is then available for experiments. An integrated isotope 
separation system can separate the components of hydrogen 
mixtures into normal hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and tritium (T) 
and resupply the thus purified tritium to the experiments. The 
pilot plant's process control system is automated and permits 
round-the-clock operation.

<F P=106> [Article by SEL: "Encapsulated Ge-Detector"] </F>
  [Text] Aachen/Juelich--An encapsulated Ge-detector has been 
developed by the Juelich research center (KFA [Nuclear Research 
Facility]) in collaboration with the University of Cologne's 
Institute for Nuclear Physics and the Intertechnique company in 
Strasbourg. The ultrahigh-vacuumtight, encapsulated germanium 
detector was brought to production readiness in the main 
Department of Technology within the framework of the Euroball 
project. The so-called Euroball is a gamma spectrometer that is 
being developed through European cooperation and will be used 
for experiments in the field of high-precision gamma 
spectroscopy. With it exotic nuclei of borderline stability can 
be studied. 
  In addition to greater reliability, the advantages of the 
Ge-detector are protection of the extremely sensitive surface of 
the detector as well as ease of operation and 
interchangeability. Furthermore, it is possible to join 
Ge-detectors together into complex detector arrangements of any 
kind whatsoever. These detectors can be regenerated without any 
problems when there is radiation damage by heating them up in 
standard ovens. 
  The range of applications of Ge-detectors includes gamma 
spectroscopy for the identification of exotic atomic nuclei, 
applied research, protection against radiation and of the 
environment, and applications in the field of medicine. 
Furthermore, the Ge-detectors presented by the KFA nuclear 
physics institute in Juelich in the journal "Inside KFA" (No. 3) 
can be used in industrial production control and space. 
  In connection with technology transfer, the Juelich research 
center has concluded a licensing agreement for the production of 
encapsulated Ge-detectors with Intertechnique. A patent for the 
production process has been applied for at the German Patent 
Office. This year a total of 16 detectors were produced and 
delivered.

  [Text] Marseilles/Paris (DPA/AP)--At the nuclear research 
center in Cadarache near Marseilles they are trying to 
deliberately bring about a meltdown of the sort that occurs 
during a presumed major accident in a power plant. The 
researchers hope to gain clues from this experiment as to how to 
improve the safety standards for future nuclear reactors. The 
experimental plant in Cadarache was provided with additional 
safety equipment to prevent radioactivity from escaping from it. 
Moreover, the experimental reactor contained only a small 
fraction of the amount of fuel in reactors of the customary 
size. That is why critics of the experiment have doubts as to 
whether the results obtained here in the laboratory can be 
applied to the conditions in large nuclear power plants. There 
were contradictory statements with regard to the duration of the 
experiment, which might also indicate that the experiment could 
have been prematurely terminated on Thursday of last week. It 
further means that the results of the experiment will be 
reported on in the course of this week. The institute wants to 
undertake five more experiments of this kind over the next few 
years.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "Juelich Reactor Operates With Biomass </F>
Support; Activated Sludge Tank Simulated; Separately Ordered 
Filtration Uses Cross-Flow Technique"] 
  [Text] Juelich--Bacteria perform important tasks in sewage 
plant activated sludge tanks. They break down a multitude of 
undesirable compounds like ammonium and highly ecologically 
harmful, problem-creating substances. Simulation of the growth 
processes in these tanks is necessary in order to study the 
decomposition processes. Wolfgang Tappe of Juelich Research 
Center, Ltd., (Institute for Biotechnology [IBT3], 52425 
Juelich) has now developed a bioreactor system that is suitable 
for these tasks. 
  As Tappe informed us in Juelich, bacteria grow in the soil 
and in water, as well as at sewage plants, at very low rates of 
growth. The supply of nutrients is frequently so limited that it 
is only enough for bacteria to survive, but not sufficient for 
growth. The study of these processes is important in view of the 
services bacteria render in breaking down harmful substances. 
With conventional bioreactor systems, however, simulation of 
these kinds of growth conditions is impossible or only very 
limited. With a continously operating laboratory bioreactor, a 
specific amount of fresh nutrient solution per time unit is 
supplied and the corresponding amount of consumed medium 
removed. In the process, biomass is also lost, which has to be 
replaced by the growth of the bacteria in the reactor. Now if 
the organisms' maximal rate of growth is very low, the danger 
exists that the lost biomass can no longer be replaced. 
  Since the average generation periods at activated sludge 
plants range from 150 to 500 hours, they are comparatively long. 
In simulating these growth conditions, conventional bioreactor 
systems are frequently overtaxed. Since the nutrient supply in 
this case is only very little, an even distribution is in part 
no longer attained in the reactor. The result is that the 
bacteria population is no longer homogeneous. Some bacteria grow 
faster than others. 
  The solution to the problem lies in the Juelich reactor with 
biomass support. The principal difference between it and the 
conventional, continuously operating reactor is a separately 
ordered filtration module. In it the consumed medium is filtered 
out while the bacteria are held back. The filtraiton process is 
not simple since the round filter has a tendency to get blocked. 
Tappe has solved this problem with the cross-flow technique. A 
magnetic agitator that creates a flow that moves at right angles 
to the direction of filtration (cross-flow) rotates right above 
the membrane. With this system, blockages can be successfully 
prevented. 
  The molecule is surrounded by a high-grade steel housing and 
is connected with the reactor container by hoses and pumps. In 
this way a continous supply of nutrients can be obtained without 
any loss of biomass and bacteria with very low rates of growth 
can be studied. These growth conditions come very close to the 
actual conditions in activated sludge tanks. The Juelich 
system's filtration module can also be used for on-line 
monitoring of sewage plants. It delivers a biomass-free sample 
from which chemical parameters can be determined.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Augereau: "Nuclear Waste: </F>
Worldwide Problem"] 
  [Excerpts] Installation of Storage 
sites Is Posing Problems Everywhere in the World 
  Where should waste from nuclear projects be stored? How can 
it be done under conditions acceptable to all? The issue is so 
sensitive and the public is now so watchful and cautious that 
the governments of nuclear energy producing countries think 
twice before presenting their proposals. Ten years ago, who 
would have predicted the proliferation of mediators, sent to the 
front lines by public administrations, nuclear industry 
manufacturers, and brand-new agencies in charge of managing this 
waste, to inform, reassure, answer questions, and consider 
everyone's probing and apprehension before reaching any 
decisions? 
  Nuclear power can no longer be forcefully imposed; public 
administrations have understood this and have learned their 
lessons from the past. In February 1990 the Rocard government, 
aware of difficulties it would encounter if it imposed this or 
that site for storage of highly active waste from the nuclear 
industry, chose to halt hostilities with the determined 
population on 9 February 1990 and to let time do its work. Of 
course this decision was not completely devoid of electoral 
considerations, but excessive coercion eventually creates a trap 
which Rocard wanted to avoid by declaring a one year moratorium 
on the management of these awkward waste products. 
  The 30 December 1991 law on this issue has formed a 
legislative framework for any new steps in this regard and given 
mediator Christian Bataille the heavy responsibility of 
consulting constituencies and collecting voluntary proposals 
from communities interested in the installation of an 
underground laboratory for research on nuclear waste. This was a 
good initiative and about 30 such proposals came quickly to 
light. 
  Today, four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Neuse, and 
Vienne 
have been tentatively selected by Bataille (see LE MONDE of 6 
January) and the government has just authorized the Radioactive 
Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) to begin geophysical surveys of 
the sites. Here again, cautiously, the authorities will take 
their time for one to two years before reaching any decision. 
  Groundbreaking for the laboratories, which will cost 1.5 
billion francs each, cannot begin before the end of 1997 at the 
earliest, which means that operations would begin in 2002. This 
would be followed by eight years of research on site quality 
(nature of bedrock, water flow study, deeply-imbedded materials 
performance, and so on); this is because ANDRA is not scheduling 
materials storage before 2020 at sites that have yet to be 
determined assuming the program is authorized to continue after 
Parliament deliberations around 2010. 
  This surfeit of caution is not unique to the French 
authorities: all nuclear energy producing countries are facing 
the same type of problems. As a matter of fact, France is 
managing fairly well at present with its surface storage for low 
radioactivity waste at the Hague (Manche) which is filled, and 
at Soulaines (Aube) which has just opened. The only remaining 
problem is to, so to speak, settle the delicate issue of 
permanent storage of highly active waste. One step has just been 
taken with Bataille's report. Many other countries wish that 
they were that far along. 
<H5>  Strong Local Opposition </H5>
  In Europe the situation has more facets as a few examples 
will illustrate. In Germany where disagreement is sharp, it is 
clear that all nuclear industry waste will be stored underground 
regardless of its radioactive level. Storage has already been 
established at two locations for low and medium-activity 
radioactive waste: at the former salt mines in Morsleben near 
the old East German border, and at Asse (Lower Saxony). The 
latter has in fact been for some years, the site of 
international experiments for storage of high radioactivity 
waste. 
  Two other sites also in Lower Saxony are currently being 
discussed as possible storage centers. The first is in Gorleben 
where two wells are being drilled in a salt dome for high 
radioactivity waste, the first shipments of which may come in 
1994 and 1999 from France and Great-Britain. But work on this 
project has been stopped. The second is at the Konrad iron mine 
for less radioactive material. But its placement into service is 
being hotly contested between the federal government and the 
Lower Saxony authorities. 
  In Switzerland where there a research laboratory in granite 
already exists at Grimsel, nuclear industry waste is housed 
on-site at plants and research facilities, while waste resulting 
from other industry activity has been temporarily stored since 
25 November 1992 at a 9.3 million Swiss franc installation in 
Wurenlingen in the Argovie canton. For permanent storage, the 
Cooperative for Radioactive Waste Storage (CEDRA) approved in 
June of last year a center whose cost is estimated at 500 
million francs and which would be built in Wellenberg in the 
semi-canton of Nidwald. 
<H5>  Swedish Example </H5>
  But canton authorities are blocking current construction 
based on their recently acquired legal power to grant licenses 
for underground utilization. Many discussions must yet take 
place before Parliament issues a decision (in 1997?) on this 
proposed center whose operation could begin in 2005. As for high 
radioactivity waste, this is only the beginning. 
  Preliminary drilling intended to analyze the nature of the 
soil (granite and gneiss) has already been conducted in the 
northern part of the country in Bottstein, Leuggern, Weiach, 
Kaisten, Schaffisheim and Siblingen. Other drilling operations 
have been requested by federal authorities to prospect clay 
deposits in the Aar Valley and in the area between Baden and 
Schaffhouse. But as the JOURNAL DE GENEVE pointed out last 
summer, in Siblingen, the canton authorization procedure for 
drilling took six years while at the federal level it took one 
year and eight months. "All that time to come to the realization 
that the site was not suitable..." 
  Clearly waste management is not an easy matter and according 
to nuclear energy promoters it is hampered less by technical 
difficulties than by social and political problems. The country 
currently having the most success in resolving them is Sweden, 
whose early decision against reprocessing irradiated fuels at 
its plants has made the choices easier. 
  Sweden has an underground facility, the SFR, carved out of 
granite on the Baltic coast not far from the Forstmark plant, 
which since April 1988 has been used for permanent storage of 
low and medium radioactivity waste. At the same time the 
Stockholm government in the early 1980's commissioned an 
enormous underground storage center in Oskarshamm, the CLAB, 
intended for storing irradiated fuels from Swedish plants for 40 
years before they are permanently buried in the substrata of the 
country's two northern communes situated right in Lappland near 
Arjeplog and Overkalix (see LE MONDE 17 September 1992). 
  Discussions are underway to determine which of these two 
locations may receive these vexatious ashes. There is no hurry, 
even if it takes time to win over a very skeptical public 
opinion. This is why, in spite of CLAB's intermediate storage 
(CLAB received its first highly radioactive shipments in July 
1985), the Swedes want proof "through a dress rehearsal" that 
their permanent storage plan in granite is efficient. 
  The Swedish Fuel and Radioactive Waste Processing Company 
(SKB) has thus begun drilling a deep tunnel in granite at 
Orskarshamm near CLAB; this is the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory 
(HRL) which is intended to serve as proving grounds for the 
engineers. The whole facility should be completed at the end of 
1994 or the beginning of 1995. But unlike its Canadian 
counterpart, URL at Pinawa in Manitoba, this underground 
laboratory will not be converted to a storage site.

Superconductors Capable of Carrying More Load"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Application of the new high temperature 
superconductors (HTSL) still fails in many areas because the 
superconductivity is lost under the influence of comparatively 
weak magnetic fields. When ceramic materials under the influence 
of magnetic fields get a little below a Tesla, they are only 
superconducting at very low temperatures of a few Kelvin. For 
important practical applications superconductivity under 
magnetic fields can therefore only be used with metallic 
superconductors and by cooling with expensive liquid helium. 
  But physicists of the University of Birmingham (School of 
Physics, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom) have now succeeded 
in making the movement of the magnetic field lines in high 
temperature superconductors visible. Consequently, there is now 
an opportunity directly to observe the effect of measures 
against the drifting of the field lines. 
  With this discovery the developers of high-temperature 
superconductors hope to be able to solve the problem in a way 
similar to the comparable behavior for metallic superconductors: 
By doping the material, the field lines are "frozen," which 
makes the construction of high-performance magnets for computer 
tomography possible, for example. 
  The observation and image recording of the magnetic field 
lines in high temperature superconducting materials succeeded 
with a neutron-scattering method in a bismuth, strontium, 
calcium-copper oxide high-temperature superconductor. The 
methods used so far in order to determine the collapse of the 
magnetic field lines were based on indirect measurement 
processes which did not give an image. 
  With the neutron scattering method both the crystalline 
structure and the field line can be recorded. If the 
high-temperature superconductors being studied are under the 
influence of a magnetic field and the temperature is raised from 
a few degrees Kelvin, after a certain point there will be such 
large internal resistances that this causes the crystalline 
structure to be lost. 
  This has the result that the superconducting state is also 
abruptly halted. Because of this phenomenon the British 
physicists speak of a "melting away" of the magnetic flux 
structure (flux lattice melting). In the high temperature 
superconductors available today this will already take place at 
temperatures between four and ten Kelvin. 
  The continued development work by several research groups in 
Europe, the United States and Japan is now aimed at finding ways 
to prevent the "migration" of the magnetic field lines as far as 
the area of critical temperatures between 90 and 100 Kelvin. 
With the "old" metallic superconductors this could only be 
achieved by adding certain compounds. Nevertheless, it took 
almost 10 years before this doping technique had been mastered 
from the aspect of production technology. Whether this will be 
achieved for high-temperature superconductors in a similarly 
long development process, is something no one dares predict. 
  Meanwhile, the development work continues in the United 
States as well. With massive support from the U.S. Department of 
Energy, the development of efficient current limiters for public 
grids from high-temperature superconducting materials is to be 
accelerated. 
  As reported by the authority, a consortium of three 
enterprises and a government research laboratory headed by the 
General Dynamics company (San Diego, California 92186, USA) has 
been awarded almost 5 million dollars for these development 
studies. 
  These funds are to help the company develop operational 
current limiters in two to at most four years. The authority 
expects that by using the new type of current limiters energy 
losses on the order of 100 million dollars a year can be avoided. 
  Current limiters are relay-type switches which keep the 
currents in high-voltage grids within certain ranges. They 
reduce the network current if, for example, lightning strikes or 
if there are short circuits. They protect the power consumers 
against having their equipment damaged by excessively high 
current. 
  By installing superconducting current limiters in 
high-voltage networks, relatively simply constructed and cheap 
power interrupters and simple fuses can be used. The investment 
and operating costs of the supplying enterprises could thus be 
reduced and the production of excess power be avoided. 
  This way the output of the supply networks can take place in 
certain voltage ranges, which leads to considerable savings for 
the power supply companies even at relatively modest cost. 
  The new high temperature superconductors which are being 
used 
for this are not under the influence of magnetic fields at the 
limiter circuits. For that reason, even with the critical 
currents of high temperature superconductors reached today they 
can be used without any further difficulties. 
  Superconducting switching elements have the advantage over 
conventional current limiters that they regulate the supply 
currents with very short switching times, practically unnoticed 
by the consumer, and in this manner provide largely uniform 
currents.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Temperature Superconductors: </F>
Dramatic Breakthrough by Two French Teams"] 
  [Text] Paris--Within a few hours of each other, two teams 
headed by French scientists announced that they had achieved a 
dramatic breakthrough in the field of superconductivity, raising 
it for the first time to around zero degree Celsius, and thus 
heralding the day when superconductors will be available at room 
temperature and under normal pressure. 
  On 17 December, the CNRS [National Center for Scientific 
Research] announced that researchers at two of its Grenoble 
laboratories had obtained mercury cuprates that are partially 
superconductive at temperatures ranging from 190 Kelvin [K] (-63 
degrees Celsius [C]) to 280 K (+7 degrees C), thus beating the 
250 K (-23 degrees C) record announced less than 24 hours before 
by a team of the Higher School of Industrial Physics and 
Chemistry of the City of Paris (ESPCI) headed by Michel 
Lagues--which record, according to the researchers themselves, 
remains to be verified. 
  Although these results were obtained by different methods 
and 
with different compounds, nevertheless they prove the existence, 
long in doubt, of superconductivity at a very high "critical 
temperature" (below which a material will conduct electric 
current without opposing any resistance to it). Less than three 
months ago[.sup]1[/], the record was only 157 K, at a 
pressure of 235 kilobars (about 235,000 atmospheres), whereas 
the new results were achieved under normal pressure. 
  The Grenoble researchers, at the Research Center on Very Low 
Temperatures (Jean-Louis Tholence, Benedict Souletie, Olivier 
Laborde) and at the Crystallography Laboratory (Catherine 
Chaillout, Jean-Jacques Capponi, Massimo Marezio, and Miguel 
Alario Franco) obtained mercury cuprates, consisting of mercury, 
barium, calcium, and CuO[.sup]2[/] copper oxide, and more 
precisely with [sic] the phase Hg-1223 
(HgBa[.sup]2[/]Ca[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8+d[/]), 
as well as Hg-1245. 
  What did the team headed by Jean-Louis Tholence and formed 
nearly seven years ago observe? The two "signatures" of 
superconductivity: a sudden drop of electric resistance (in 
seven of the samples) and the "diamagnetic transition," which 
shows as an apparent magnetization in a direction opposed to 
that of the magnetic field applied to the sample (on the 15 or 
so samples), at temperatures ranging from 190 K to 280 K, 
depending on the compounds. 
  According to Jean-Louis Tholence, the record, a 
"superconductive transition" at 280 K, was observed on "one 
percent of the sample volume." Its structure remains to be 
determined in order to obtain samples with larger 
"superconductive" fractions. A report on this research will be 
published on 3 January in the American review PHYSICS 
LETTERS.[.sup]2[/] 
  At the end of September, the Grenoble physicists had already 
achieved a record, reaching a critical temperature of 157 K in a 
mercury cuprate (Hg-1223, already), but subjecting the sample to 
a very high pressure: 235 kilobars. Like Paul Chu and his team 
at the Houston University, they used the fact that, in these 
cuprates, bringing atoms closer together (which can be done by 
applying pressure) will increase the critical temperature. 
  In November 1992, the Crystallography Laboratory had 
discovered the first compound of the family, Hg-1201 
(HgBa[.sup]2[/]CuO[.sub]4[/]) with the collaboration of 
Serguei Poutiline of the Lomonossov University in Moscow, who 
was in Grenoble at the time. 
  The Grenoble researchers' samples measured about 10 cubic 
millimeters. The material in which the ESPCI team[.sup]3[/] 
observed a "resistive transition" at 250 K--i.e. a sudden 
decrease of electric resistance, "by a factor of 100,000," which 
led the researchers to believe that it involved a 
superconductive transition--was a bismuth cuprate, of the 
BiSrCaCuO family (bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide), 
deposited on a substrate in the form of a 30-nanometer thick 
film. In addition, the characteristics of the phenomenon--in 
particular its non-linearity, i.e. the anomalies observed in the 
current/voltage ratio (which normally increase [sic] in a linear 
manner)--"point to the existence in this material of a 
superconductive phase at a still higher temperature, which a few 
minor changes might make evident." 
  This result, an account of which was published in the 
American weekly SCIENCE,[.sup]4[/] was obtained through long 
and persistent research performed in collaboration at the 
Tel-Aviv University (Guy Deutscher), the Higher Normal School 
(Philippe Monod, Nicole Bontemps), the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie 
University (Julien Bok, also at the ESPCI), and the Institute of 
Materials Sciences and Radiation or ISMRA (Guy Raveau) in Caen. 
  Actually, back in 1986 a Surfaces and Superconductors team 
was created at the ESPCI; the following year, the team leader, 
Michel Lagues (with the support of Jacques Lewiner, scientific 
director of the ESPCI, and Julien Bok) decided to attempt the 
development of thin-film superconductors. To deposit these films 
on a substrate, one atom layer at a time, the ESPCI decided to 
acquire a machine that Riber, the French manufacturer of 
epitaxial facilities (which currently supplies 50 percent of the 
world market) took two years to develop, jointly with the ESPCI 
team. 
  Although the initial results were disappointing, which 
explains why many teams throughout the world became 
discouraged--actually, in cuprates, atoms are not always willing 
to cooperate and grow in a single plane (a phenomenon which 
Michel Lagues proposed to call "infinite phase" growth)--the 
team managed to master this method of "epitaxy through imposed 
sequence of atomic layers," which is continuously controlled by 
electronic diffraction, and they prepared their first sample, 
with three layers of copper oxide, and then, two years later, 
the present compound with eight CuO[.sup]2[/] layers. 
  The technique was covered by a patent application and a 
structure was set up jointly with Sofinnova for "the industrial 
implementation of this research." Although the diamagnetism of 
the sample remains to be verified (a difficult operation 
considering the thinness of the film, which tests the 
sensitivity of measuring instruments), the ESPCI seems 
confident. These results, they estimated, "should open a new 
field for the study of the superconductive properties of 
cuprates," and above all "should make it possible to achieve the 
goal pursued for 15 years by many laboratories throughout the 
world: to dispense with cryogenics, which until now was required 
to achieve superconductivity at normal pressure." 
  With the results of these two teams, the wild hope of 
obtaining superconductive materials at room temperature 
therefore seems to be taking shape. Although no "superconductor 
market" can be envisioned within the next five years, as Michel 
Lagues pointed out on 17 December, nevertheless huge long-term 
prospects are opening up in the low-current field, i.e. in 
electronics and data processing.

<H5>  Iritel Joint Stock Company </H5>
  This was created on 8 May 1992 to manage the transitional 
phase that will lead to the constitution of a single 
administration. It will guarantee the continuity of services by 
transferring and retraining personnel who were formerly with 
ASST [State Telephone Services Agency] and PT [Post and 
Telecommunications] (about 12,000 people), and by creating the 
technical, economic, and organizational conditions for the 
successive integration of its own operational structures into 
the new system. It is the sole administrator of public and 
private telecommunications systems (including equipment 
installation and management), formerly done by ASST and the PT 
Administration. The telegram, electronic mail, and public 
telematics services carried out by post offices, national 
telex-data services and, until the relative concessions expire, 
those entrusted to SIRM [Italian Marine Radio Corporation] and 
Telemar, are excluded. 
  Iritel supplies the means of transmission within the 
national 
long-distance network for interconnection between the transit 
switching nodes of the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone 
Company] (SGT) network and between these and the national 
transit nodes managed by Iritel itself (for European traffic) 
and by Italcable (for intercontinental traffic). Furthermore it 
manages international traffic to and from Europe and the 
countries bordering on the Mediterranean basin, together with 
the relative equipment. 
<H5>  Italcable Joint Stock Company </H5>
  This company manages intercontinental telecommunications 
services (telephones, data transmission, telex, cables, and new 
value-added services). Furthermore it participates in the study 
and realization of the more important underwater cable systems. 
It is collaborating with partners in the Atlantic area to build 
a vast and complex network that directly connects North America, 
the Mediterranean, and South-East Asia. Its network is one of 
the largest and most diversified in the world and uses both 
cables and satellites in a balanced way. 
  It is quoted on the stock exchange and has a capital stock 
of 
275 billion lire. In 1992, with 3,068 employees, its proceeds 
were 789 billion lire; investments totalled 120 billion lire 
with profits of 130 billion lire. 
<H5>  SIP Joint Stock Company </H5>
  SIP -- the Italian telecommunications company that 
administers national public telecommunications services -- is 
responsible for customer relations. 
It guarantees the basic telephone service, with 23.7 million 
subscribers (in 1992) that will rise to 26 million in 1996, with 
a density of over 45 percent of the population. One subscriber 
in five belongs to the business world, whilst there are over 1 
million mobile telephones and it is forecast that this number 
will double by 1996. There are more than 240 million kilometers 
of circuits under our cities and along our motorways and in 1996 
about 40 billion communications are forecast, that is more than 
75,000 per minute. 
  The primary goals of SIP are the modernization of the 
network 
and the management and maintenance systems, improvement of 
quality, and the introduction of new services (ISDN [integrated 
services digital network], intelligent networks, etc.). 
  It is quoted on the stock exchange and has a capital stock 
of 
5.465 trillion lire. With 89,293 employees, in 1992 its 
revenues were 21.557 trillion lire; investments totalled 9.718 
trillion lire and profits 461 billion lire. 
<H5>  SIRM Joint Stock Company </H5>
  SIRM is involved in the installation, running, and 
maintenance of the radio stations that legally must be on board 
pleasure craft and ships bearing the Italian flag. In addition 
it sells various types of radio navigation aids. These are 
divided into two categories: those with a high innovative 
content for ships with large tonnage (satellite terminals and 
integrated navigation systems) and those that use the older 
technologies, for a wider and less professional market, such as 
the fishing sector and pleasure craft. 
  It has a national maintenance network with 10 operations 
depots and about 40 agencies in the principal coastal towns. 
<H5>  Telespazio Joint Stock Company </H5>
  Telespazio -- space telecommunications company -- has the 
exclusive concession in Italy for satellite communications 
(telephones, television and data). It participates in advanced 
space programs and in the design and testing of new applications 
for satellites. It is developing the use of small antennas on 
dedicated networks and has over 400 completed installations. It 
is the first supplier in the world of telemetry services, and 
services for the management and control of satellites in orbit. 
It receives, processes, and distributes the data transmitted by 
Earth observation satellites (remote sensing). 
  It has a capital stock of 40.2 billion lire and has 1,130 
employees. In 1992 its revenues were 348 billion lire; 
investments totalled 126 billion lire and profits 25 billion 
lire.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Question of Competitivity"] </F>
  [Text] We are believers in the opportunity market that may 
be created by ISDN and so it appears are the national 
telecommunication companies (TELCOs) which shortly, before the 
end of this year, will begin to celebrate the birth of 
Euro-ISDN, Europe's ISDN showcase. In its most recent meeting, 
the European ISDN User Forum, which now boosts an average 
attendance of some 300 participants -- mainly service providers, 
at its six-monthly rendez-vous, announced TELCOs plans for 
launching the special EURIE '93 week from 12-17 December. 
  The demonstrations, to run concurrently in all main European 
cities, will come to a head on December 14 when, in a live 
broadcast from Brussels, top European Union (former European 
Community) executives and Belgacom chairman, Bessel Kok, will 
discuss ISDN and map out its European future. 
  In another meeting, recently held at one of Europe's 
best-known universities, ERASMUS in The Netherlands, we have 
already tested for ourselves some of the promises of ISDN. 
  Live videoconferences and all forms of multimedia 
transmission (what will come of Electronic Trade Data 
Interchange?) are possible with a modest Apple and a 64 Kbits/s 
channel. Two channels offer much better quality of course. 
Cost? Not more than ECU5,000-6,000 (dollars approx.), computer 
and telecamera included. 
  But this is only part of the Pandora's box that may be 
opened 
up by ISDN. Consider the opportunities for teleshopping, 
telebanking, interactive television and other multimedia 
wonders. British Telecom is likely to be allowed to send movies 
to the homes of all who have a telephone. Analogue may offer 
patchy quality, but ISDN, through the very substantial advances 
made in the past two years in data compression technology, will 
certainly be up to standard. 
  In the meantime, whilst Europe is struggling to find its 
ISDN 
identity, other developed regions are not waiting on the 
sidelines. East Asia, Pacific countries and North America are 
moving swiftly to be ahead of the game. Pacific Bell, one of 
the large United States "Bell" companies, has just announced 
plans, in line with the political motivation of Vice-President 
Gore, for the creation of the "super highways" data 
infrastructure, modernizing its California network with a fibre 
cable investment of some ECU16 billion. Forecasts are for some 
five million homes to be connected by the year 2000. To put 
this in perspective, that is more than all houses in Belgium. 
  Europe is also doing what it can, although, if one takes the 
recent announcement by Mr. Carpentier, Head of the powerful 
Directorate General XIII (Telecommunications, Information Market 
and Exploitations of Research), for a ECU90 million grant to 
help ISDN developments, one begins to wonder what sort of 
minimalistic policies Europe is beginning to implement. Sure, 
this is money that will go towards sharpening interconnectivity 
and convergence, but it is like spraying droplets of water on 
dry soil. Hopefully this will only be an interim measure, until 
the EU's Council of Ministers unblocks funding for some ECU13 
billion for the next quadrennial plan for research and 
development in the European Union. 
  Still, as this money must be shared amongst all sorts of 
R&amp;D, 
very little can be expected to be added to the ISDN pot. 
  It goes without saying that TELCOs prefer to address their 
investments to their own markets and may consider European needs 
as peripheral matters. Why release, for the common good, 
research and development effort that may give other operators a 
leading edge? 
  We must consequently accept with some reservations any claim 
that ISDN is fully available across frontiers. TELCOs' driving 
strategy may differ and so will the facilities that they 
provide. Full integration will be delayed by other important 
factors. Few European TELCOs aim to provide facilities wall to 
wall, something that would make ISDN really take off. France, 
the United Kingdom and a good part of united Germany may move 
perceptibly ahead, but most of the others show more than 
unwillingness to offer customers ISDN home-based facilities. 
  We, for one, resident in the capital of Europe, ten minutes 
by car from the headquarters of the powerful Directorate XIII, 
Telecommunications, will be unlikely to see the light of fibre 
optics in our office this century, if ever. Imagine the destiny 
of some of the more remote regions in this Europe of ours. 
  Then there is the problem of cooperation. We are all agreed 
that telecommunications knows no bounds, yet it looks as if the 
dismantling of those we have today may take sufficient time to 
ensure that we all become economically handicapped in the 
meantime. Size is the game of the next century: to have size, 
one needs alliances. It may be a shame that Europe's three 
giants (British, French and German TELCOs) did not manage to 
decide on a common penetration policy and have now gone their 
separate ways, forming two distinct blocks, one by the British 
Telecom and MCI alliance and the other codenamed Project 
Atlantic (French, German Telecoms and AT&amp;T). 
  It reminds us of efforts, in the late 1970s, to try to bring 
Euro manufacturers, ICL, Siemens, BULL and Olivetti around the 
discussion table to form a Euro-venture. See what has become of 
them now. 
  Of course, there is always the spectre of Directorate 
General 
IV, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission, to 
remind us that such alliances create almost monopolistic 
situations. Let's wait and see. 
  Yes, we are believers of the opportunity market that may be 
created by Euro-ISDN, but we know that this will only be 
possible if it is given size, spread and funding to implement 
killer, multimedia-based applications. In short, a joint 
investment in hard Euro-cash rather than soft Euro-words at 
Euro-ISDN festivities.

  [Text] The Federal Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [BMPT] has concluded a memorandum of 
understanding with the Ukrainian postal administration on aid 
with legislation on the postal reform planned in the Ukraine. 
Dr. Laufs handed and illustrated to the Ukrainian delegation a 
paper on the assistance to be provided by the Federal Government 
in an advisory capacity. He pronounced the BMPT willing to 
tutor experts from the Ukraine in Germany. There is enormous 
interest in the Ukraine in laying and operating optical fiber 
lines for the trunk network, and a leasing model is being drawn 
up with DBP [Deutsche Bundespost] Telekom to finance the 
program. In parallel with the political talks, BMPT manager 
Masson discussed the issue of radio frequencies with Ukrainian 
specialists. Their talks covered openness in frequency 
allocation, licensing, and approval matters, charges, monitoring 
systems, and organizational and working procedures. Since its 
separation from Moscow, the Ukraine has had neither specialists 
nor data material at its disposal. Germany thus promised 
support with the technical preparations for the forthcoming 
world broadcasting conference. 
  The telecommunications sector in the Ukraine is much 
courted, 
and the United States, the Netherlands, and France are all 
trying hard to get a foot in the door for their companies. DBP 
Telekom, too, has permanent representatives in the Ukraine: 
Telekom holds shares in mobile radio and the digital overlay 
network, and has also trained 100 experts from the Ukraine. 
Siemens maintains a joint venture engaged in manufacturing its 
EWS [electronic switching system].

  [Text] STET has just celebrated its 60th anniversary and 
has begun to make its "comeback" by establishing the basis for 
the development that will take place in the coming years, and 
that will see it playing a leading role in the most important 
change in the history of Italian telecommunications. It is an 
organizational and financial effort that has no precedents and 
is already being formed as a result of the law providing for the 
reorganization of telephonic services, the first tangible 
effects of which will be seen between 1 January and the end of 
1996. 
  The document has still not been made public but some 
guidelines have been revealed by Managing Director Michele 
Tedeschi. 
  In brief, there are plans for an investment program that 
will 
have a total value of 32 trillion lire, and a growth in revenues 
of between 30 and 36 trillion lire per year, with the goal of 
reaching a telephone density of 48.4 percent in a context that 
is becoming more and more internationalized. These are the most 
important statistics of the "group program" for 1994-1996, that 
was approved in mid-November by the STET board of directors, 
presided over by Biagio Agnes. This period will be particularly 
demanding for the IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of 
Industry] finance company, because of the reorganization of 
telephonic services to form a single operator, Telecom Italia, 
and the effects of this reorganization that will start to be 
seen within a market situation that is continually evolving both 
at home and abroad. 
  The sole operator, which will surmount the fragmentation of 
the five former concessionaires, will face the opening up of 
overseas markets following the abolition of the monopolies, the 
appearance of large foreign corporations, and the formation of 
new alliances that go beyond national and continental barriers. 
  The formulation of the plan is therefore coherent with the 
current trends of demand that accentuate the supremacy of market 
factors in a context that is increasingly characterized by 
strong competition. With the new organization, the Italian 
system, like those of the other major European countries, will 
be able to present itself on the services market with a 
structure that is capable of enforcing a strategy of a single 
offer and competitivity, with the prospect of reaping all the 
possibilities of growth in the telecommunications sector. 
  In particular, the constitution of the sole operator, the 
formation of which, it has been confirmed, will take place 
before September 1994, will permit its intrinsic synergies to be 
exploited. Consequently this will strengthen its position both 
on the national and international markets, and ensure the group 
a more favorable contractual position within the context of a 
global alliance. 
  Specific emphasis will be given in the new plan to client 
segmentation to be able to prepare the most appropriate response 
in terms of services/prices, particularly for business clients. 
The rapid strengthening of the network structure and the 
relative administration systems, the strong nationwide 
organization of customer services, and the evolution of the 
pricing structure, will contribute to this. In 1994, the latter 
in particular will already have the goal of gradually reducing 
existing mutual assistance to give greater competitiveness to 
the global supply system through the reduction of long-distance 
prices, and thereby start to catch up with the most advanced 
organizations at international level. 
  Therefore, in view of the fact that the program contract 
will 
be applied when the single operator is formed, the plan has been 
worked out on the basis of a price restructuring process that 
does not presuppose greater net capital contributions to the 
sector. The resulting benefits will be an improved utilization 
of the network and a more favorable market position. 
  These actions are part of a management plan that also 
foresees achieving a notable improvement in economic-financial 
strength. 
  Under this profile the program is characterized by a growth 
in the volume of revenues from the current 30 trillion lire to 
38 trillion lire by 1996, and by overall investments of over 32 
trillion, and a revenue situation that will be decisively better 
than that of 1993, the results of which were already favorable. 
It is also forecast that debts will be notably reduced thanks 
to the good progress of internal financing which, in the next 
three years, will be clearly in excess of requirements for 
investments. 
  As far as quantitative aspects are concerned the program 
provides for: 
  -- An increase of about 1.5 million subscribers to the fixed 
network, 600,000 of which business subscribers; an increase of 
over 800,000 subscribers to mobile services; a density 
(subscribers to fixed and mobile services) that will reach a 
value of 48.4 percent by the end of 1996; and a final total of 
over 300,000 ISDN [integrated services digital network] 
equivalent connections; 
  -- A development of national traffic for which a growth rate 
of 6.7 percent per year is foreseen, and of international and 
intercontinental traffic for which notably higher increases are 
foreseen (respectively about 12 percent and over 13 percent); 
  -- Further technological updating of the network, continuing 
with the digitization of the exchanges (77 percent by the end of 
1996) and the extension of optical fibers to the distribution 
network too. As far as the industrial sector is concerned 
programs are aimed at improving productivity and increasing 
foreign market penetration. Special emphasis has been placed on 
the complete integration of the Finsiel group to exploit the 
potential synergies of information science and 
telecommunications services. 
  Finally, the process of internationalization, which provides 
for investments of about 1.5 trillion lire, hinges on the 
acquisition of licenses to carry out services in areas of 
preeminently strategic interest as well as on the reinforcement 
of the supply system in an international environment through 
strategic alliances that also involve the industrial activities 
of the group.

  [Text] A workforce of 106,000 employees, 11.58 trillion 
lire in investments, 24.896 trillion lire in revenues from 
sales: With this identity card the companies involved in the 
reorganization of telephone services in Italy have faced 1993, 
the year that has seen them lead separate lives for the last 
time. In fact, at the end of December, the formal acts required 
by the Italian civil code for the constitution of the sole 
telecommunications operator, which will have its new 
organizational structure by 1994, will be completed. 
  Even if the new company, Telecom Italia, does not formally 
exist, the general lines for its development have already been 
traced out at STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. The plan 
for the next three years is not, as plans in former years have 
been, a "company" plan. It has been prepared as a "business" 
plan in view of the current situation. It is a group plan that 
will identify itself with the new operator plan. It is not the 
sum of various company plans, but a plan for a new integrated 
organization. It contains the basic directives and the stages 
of realization up to 1996. 
  Italian telecommunications have started to move in two 
directions in recent months. The first is the legal definition 
of the form of Telecom Italia, starting 1 January under the 
convention, and should in any case be finalized by next 
September. The second will establish the operational structure 
of the company, with the first three-year plan being constructed 
"in the laboratory." Though the companies are still separate, 
STET is busy preparing a plan which is based on the logic of a 
single organization and not on the simple coordination of 
autonomous programs. 
  This first attempt is the premise that will make the single 
plan operational for the next period: the three years 
1995-1997. This will be the real organizational plan for 
Telecom Italia and will be created using this new logic from the 
beginning. The strategies are being prepared. Successively 
they will be verified by the units dealing with the individual 
products, and then nationally. The feedback will be put 
together to initiate the process of adaptation to actual market 
requirements. 
  To get an idea of the task awaiting the new single operator 
we should consider the fact that the number of telephone 
subscribers in our country will increase from 22.35 million in 
1990 (with a density of 39.78 percent), to 25.19 million in 
1995, and 29.83 million in 2000 with a density of 52.1 percent. 
According to forecasts, the percentage increase of subscribers 
over the decade 1991-2000 will touch 33.5 percent. In market 
terms, a total of ECU92.562 billion is forecast for the decade 
1991-2000. 
  Telecom Italia is being set up to be the sole operator of 
all 
the services that are subject to controls at the present time. 
It is easy to see that when we get to 1998, with the complete 
liberalization planned by the EEC, the operational structures 
will have to adapt to the new situation. In fact, the operators 
for the services to be liberalized will either have structures 
that are based on existing divisions, or distinct entities will 
be formed. 
  The operator could have a structure based on operational 
divisions for controlled services, and perhaps have independent 
structures for the services that are not controlled. Telecom 
Italia will come under the STET holding company, so it will be 
alongside other companies (software companies, manufacturers, 
etc.). Relationships with the outside world, the general policy, 
and coordination will be defined at a holding level to make the 
maximum use of existing synergies. 
  The telecommunications world is complex so it is difficult 
to 
outline a definitive policy at this moment. For example, mobile 
radio services, that is small mobile telephones that are 
available today using structures of superimposed networks 
interconnected with the fixed network, still remain an open 
issue. It is necessary to define regulations for 
interconnection by evaluating both the technical problems and 
the economic problems (access charges and others). 
  In any case, with the liberalization planned for the coming 
years, the operator will be able to offer customers a "package" 
of services using a single system that is the result of very 
close integration. 
<H5>  Internationalization </H5>
  Telecommunications is moving toward a world that has no 
frontiers. The most recent forecasts indicate that in 1995 more 
than half a billion of the 5.1 billion inhabitants of the world 
will be telephone subscribers, with a density of 11.68 percent. 
At the start of the new century there will be 5.4 billion 
inhabitants and the subscribers will increase to 723.4 million, 
this being a density of 13.32 percent. A percentage increase of 
44.7 percent is forecast for telephone subscribers during the 
decade 1991-2000. Furthermore, processes are under way to open 
up markets for telecommunications services that will provide 
interesting prospects for the operators. These facts alone show 
that operators must undertake a process of internationalization 
aimed at reinforcing overseas markets. There are two roads that 
can be followed. 
  The first is tendering for licenses in countries where the 
system is being privatized. This type of participation would 
also provide the other members of the group with opportunities. 
For example, in Argentina, STET, having acquired the 
telecommunications license for the north of the country, is 
providing new openings for both manufacturers and for plant 
installation. 
  The second road is that of the problem of alliances with 
foreign organizations. This affects all the group, which 
operates in all areas of the information technology sector, and 
has areas of convergence between the operators of services, 
constructors of equipment, and producers of software. In the 
United States, a colossus like AT&amp;T allies itself with 
various 
local partners to offer its own services/products on a world 
basis. In this context the goal of the operator must be to 
"serve" business clients, and in particular the multinationals, 
with a new supply capability. That is to say the operator must 
be capable of satisfying the communications requirements of its 
clients with technical commercial structures, and with a 
portfolio of products/services that can satisfy a demand that is 
becoming more and more personalized, and that as far as 
geographical dimension is concerned, often goes outside national 
boundaries. It is a process that will become more and more 
important in the world of the future and that will cause a major 
ferment in the new markets. For this reason the sole Italian 
operator has launched its own policy of internationalization, as 
the major operators throughout the world are trying to do. It 
is an obligatory choice in order to face the opening up of the 
markets, in which the competition tends to acquire the richest 
parts, given that the market cannot be defended by staying at 
home. 
  Telecom Italia, like the other operators, must rapidly 
insert 
itself in international alliances where the goal is to protect 
the world market that will no longer be regional but global at 
the end of this decade following liberalization. 
  The choices are: 
  1) To have local distribution agreements for the services of 
third parties; 
  2) To be one of those operating at a global level, 
constructing services together with other administrations. 
  The Italian telecommunications system is classified sixth in 
the world for volume of business. Because of its size and what 
it can offer, it cannot remain limited to its own country. The 
Italian operator cannot just be a distributor at a local level. 
It must enter into alliances with partners who will contribute 
to increased competitivity at a world level in order to protect 
its clients at home, to acquire shares in international markets, 
and to carry out the role of a global operator with an 
infrastructure, commercial network, and portfolio of 
products/services that enable it to acquire competitiveness 
worldwide. 
  The policy of alliances has been pursued for some time by 
other countries, and from now on it will be a point of 
fundamental importance for modern operators. We cannot wait 
until Telecom Italia is ready with all its structures: for this 
reason work is already being done so that the new operator can 
start off with a precise direction for its actions in the 
international market. The network of alliances should therefore 
be operative when the new sole operator is officially formed. 
  An essential point is the choice of partners. It is 
necessary to choose partners that have common objectives, in 
order to combine capacities and resources, and to be able to 
increase presence on the market. The characteristics of 
individual operators should be taken into consideration when 
seeking partners to bring complementary activities together, 
thereby attaining greater competitive strength. 
  If Italy is to retain its place within the "group of the 
seven most industrialized countries" the Italian 
telecommunications system but must be an active, not a 
subordinate, partner in the new initiatives. It must play a 
role of equal dignity in the game of alliances that is being 
defined and must build up relationships with the goal of 
offering global services: This will start in the first instance 
with an agreement between operators. Then it will be possible 
to think about successive agreements with other bodies (for 
example in the software sector, etc.), to extend the 
competitivity of the group, utilizing the synergies of an 
integrated system like STET. 
  The STET group is looking at the future as a challenge that 
is presenting itself at a moment that is rich both in 
opportunities and in threats. The opening up of world markets, 
and their complete liberalization, are fundamental elements 
characterizing the new scene in which the operators have to 
move. The STET group, understanding the size of the problem 
that has to be faced from an organizational point of view, and 
the strategic choices that are necessary, has already started to 
introduce greater efficiency and productivity on the operational 
structures side and to also acquire greater competitivity for 
the entire range of its products/services through alliances that 
can ensure suitable complementarity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The EC's Directive on Satellite </F>
Communications"] 
  [Text] The EC has issued its draft directive on the mutual 
recognition of satellite licenses. The draft directive is aimed 
at the markets for such activities as provision of FSAT 
services, MSS services and SNG. 
  A major change from previous proposals from the EC is the 
addition of a one stop shopping procedure in the directive, 
replacing the concept of a single community license issued by 
the Commission. This reflects what has actually happened at 
national level over the last two years. Whilst the Commission 
clearly wants a mechanism which provides licenses that are 
harmonised and fully recognised by all member states, the 
transitional one stop shopping procedure reflects the reality 
that this will be slow and difficult to implement. It also 
appears to reflect a shift of power away from DG XIII to CEPT 
and national level. 
  The Commission hopes that the transitional concept of one 
stop shopping will be replaced over time by "appropriate 
harmonisation conditions". 
  The document is largely silent on the issue of direct access 
to Eutelsat and Intesat -- "As concerns the discussions in the 
International Satellite Organisations... on improvements to the 
access conditions to the space segment capacity of their 
respective intergovernmental satellite systems, this proposal 
builds on the progress of these discussions and in particular 
the recent decision by the Eutelsat Assembly of Parties to 
propose the Member States options for improved and broadened 
access either through the installation of a national Signatory 
Affaire Office and/or through the so called multiple access 
option in which access to the capacity can also be sought via 
Signatories other than the national one. The proposal foresees 
that both options shall be implemented and recognised." 
  The position is a significant shift from the 1990 Green 
Paper 
which explicitly called for EC action to ensure direct access to 
Eutelsat and Intelsat. However, the EC says that the draft 
directive now "further builds on the discussions and decisions 
taking place within the International Satellite Organisations 
and in particular those within the Eutelsat framework." 
  An indication of just how slow the Commission has been in 
this sector is that the Green paper was issued (after much 
delay) in November 1990. The final directive is planned for 
implementation no later than 1 October 1995. Trade sources 
suggest that this is a tight timetable given that European 
Radiocommunications Office (see later) has other greater 
priorities than satellite communications; it is unlikely that 
the Commission will have its act together until well into 1995. 
<H5>  Power to CEPT </H5>
  The draft directive calls for a major CEPT role in 
implementing the harmonisation of licensing conditions for 
satellite services as distinct from the interim one stop 
shopping set up. CEPT represents all European countries, not 
just the 12 members of the European Union. The draft calls for 
two CEPT bodies to have a role, the European Committee for 
Telecommunications Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA) and the European 
Radiocommunications Committee/Office (ERC). 
  "As a first step, ECTRA may be mandated by the Commission to 
elaborate the technical basis for harmonised licensing 
conditions, based on the expertise of ECTRA and ERC, in the 
wider European context, and as such appropriate to satellite 
communications. The technical basis could include matters such 
as arrangements for the coordination of frequencies or for site 
approval, verification of space segment access arrangements, 
issuing of network numbering schemes, practical arrangements 
which facilitiate contacts with prospective licensed satellite 
network operators in case of an emergency, practical adherence 
to specific national conditions in conformance with Community 
law etc." 
  "As a second step, the Commission will test the provided 
technical basis against Community law and policies, in 
particular telecommunications policy; after which common 
licensing conditions will be adopted. In accordance with the 
responsibilities conferred on the Commission by the Directive." 
<H5>  One Stop Shopping Timetable </H5>
  Fairly tight timetables are set down for the issue of 
licenses under the one stop shopping arrangements. When a 
service or network provider files with a national organisation 
for a license, that organisation must notify national regulatory 
authorities involved within seven days. 
  The national regulatory authority responsible for issuing 
the 
license must take a decision and inform the applicant within six 
weeks of receipt of application. 
<H5>  LEO's </H5>
  The draft also addresses the issue of new service categories 
for which harmonised Community licensing conditions have not yet 
been agreed, such as services from non-geostationary satellites 
and in cases where certain satellite services might not be 
covered by any of the established service categories due to the 
uniqueness of the service for which a license is sought. Under 
such circumstances, applications for mutual recognition can be 
dealt with under transitional one stop shopping until harmonised 
conditions for the service category in question have been 
elaborated. 
<H5>  The Community Telecommunications Committee (CTC) </H5>
  The EC intends to use the CTC as the vehicle to implement 
the 
directive at Community level. The CTC is composed of 
representatives of national regulatory authorities of EU member 
states. However, most of the major tasks of implementation of 
the directive will be taken at national level. The CTC will 
also be used as a conciliation body when appeals are made to the 
Commission. 
<H5>  Bad News for the USA </H5>
  The Directive will give rights to satellite service 
providers 
or network operators only if they are owned through a three 
quarters majority ownership by member states and/or national of 
member states. "That means that a US owned SNG operation, for 
example, could be forced to continue to obtain licenses at 
national level and have a separate license for each of the 12 
member states. In practice it looks to be more of a vehicle to 
keep U.S. common carriers out of the European marketplace. 
Indeed, European organisations are currently specifically 
prevented from obtaining common carrier licenses in the USA. 
  The draft directive states that the protectionist measures 
"will remain to be applied until satisfactory completion of 
bilateral or multilateral agreements which allow a more balanced 
developments, or until the developments of the satellite sector 
requires a review of these provisions...." 
  Essentially this is a GATT services issue covered in last 
month's final meeting or the Uruguay round. 
  It appears that the clauses are likely to lead to a lot of 
lobbying by US interests.

  [Text] The government's move from Bonn to Berlin must 
not allow political tourism to explode. Telecooperation and a 
multimedia datalink are supposed to keep the travelling frenzy 
within bounds. 
  Albert Noltemeier refuses to accept at least one argument 
from those opposed to the government's partial move from Bonn to 
Berlin: "Effective cooperation is also possible over great 
distances," maintains the expert from the Society for 
Mathematics and Data Processing (Gesellschaft fuer Mathematik 
und Datenverarbeitung mbH, GMD) in Sankt Augustin near Bonn. 
  Noltemeier knows what he's talking about. The national 
research institute itself has long been testing work in 
"distributed organizations." As early as last summer, the 
society set up more than 30 teleworkstations at its headquarters 
in Schloss Birlinghoven and in locations in Darmstadt and 
Berlin. The datalink functions via telecom's switched broadband 
network with a bandwidth of 140 megabits per second. The 
workstations are each equipped with a computer, audio and video 
accessories, and the necessary applications software. 
  This is testing the future of the "innovative Bonn-Berlin 
datalink" (Informationsverbund Bonn-Berlin, IVBB), developed for 
the Federal Ministry of the Interior by the GMD together with 
partners at universities and in industry. The project bears the 
name POLIKOM. The term is a combination of the Greek polis 
(cities) and communication. Prof. Dr. Dennis Tsichritzis, GMD's 
chairman of the board, sees implementation of the link as an 
"outstanding opportunity for the exemplary use of cooperation 
and communication technology in Germany." 
  POLIKOM, for which the federal government will spend at 
least 
120 million marks by 1997, should give Germany a leading 
position in the area of multimedia technologies. Economic 
researchers estimate that the market for high speed 
communication systems will boom. With components for this 
technology, sales could grow from almost $20 billion to about 
$55 billion by 1997. 
  US President Bill Clinton declared the national networking 
of 
the states with data connections as being among the most 
important tasks in building up the infrastructure. Total cost: 
$500 billion over 15 years. Whether or not Clinton can mobilize 
these gigantic sums in view of pressure to cut costs in the 
American budget remains to be seen. Germany, however, with Bonn 
and Berlin as separate seats of government, needs a modern 
communications link. Industry is also urgently seeking 
possibilities for faster data transfer. 
  And in a united Europe, it would be almost essential for 
survival. "European integration will put demands on all forms of 
government to coordinate and integrate their functions," says 
Dr. Nigel W. Horne of KPMG Management Consulting in London. 
However, this sort of cooperation and communication can hardly 
succeed with today's methods, which, along with telephone and 
fax, are characterized in particular by automobile, airplane, 
and train travel. In Great Britain alone, according to a traffic 
study, job-related car travel amounts to about 170 billion 
kilometers each year. Depending on the size of the company car, 
that corresponds to billions of liters of gasoline, which, 
moreover, are increasingly often frittered away uselessly in 
traffic jams. Horne is not the only one convinced that 
"effective communications systems, which reduce the need to 
travel, can contribute to energy conservation." 
  POLIKOM managers have already outlined a scenario of how 
that 
could function: A member of the Bonn Bundestag who wants to lead 
talks in his district, see how construction is coming along in 
Berlin, and take part in a committee meeting usually needs two 
to three days to do it now, suffers a lot of stress, and travels 
many kilometers. With POLIKOM technology, the representative 
could manage this all in a single day, largely stress-free and 
without having to leave his office. 
  Telepresence and telecommunication are the technical terms 
for this. In the future, says Dr. Josef Schaefer, program 
manager of the project, telepresence techniques should make it 
possible "to hold working meetings with participants in 
different locations using the same databases, transparent 
presentation media, and with joint work on the same document." 
That is far more than today's videoconferences already offer. 
  Figure 1. Telepresence: Collaboration hundreds of kilometers 
apart. [Figure not reproduced] 
  In general, the systems must assure the exchange of 
information between partners in different locations, facilitate 
collaboration between widely scattered sites, and support the 
cooperation of groups over relatively great distances. 
  Through joint viewing of documents, telepointing, and joint 
editing, mediated by data lines, this should operate as if the 
coworkers were sitting in a single building on several different 
floors, as commonly happens today. 
  In telegroup work areas, it must be possible for discussions 
to take place in which everyone has rapid access to the same 
archives, records, and documents. Personal teleworkstations 
should facilitate rapid contact with each other over hundreds of 
kilometers at any time. 
  In this way, telecooperation, the shared performance and 
coordination of tasks, should become possible. In POLIKOM, a 
sort of personal assistant is supposed to organize tasks, manage 
and monitor deadlines, and perform secretarial duties. 
Information can be obtained quickly from a multimedia archive. 
Encoding functions and electronic signatures should provide for 
data security. 
  Figure 2. Datalink: Multimedia documents from the electronic 
archive. Features include: decentralized information sources; 
records and written document management; multimedia archives; 
organizational knowledge bases and other sources of information; 
distributed telecooperation workstations; personal files; data 
switching; network access. [Figure not reproduced] 
  All are functions which are available at least in the early 
stages today, but which must still be integrated into a whole. 
In today's prototypes of POLIKOM teleworkstations at the GMD-- 
cost per workstation about 50,000 marks--some of these functions 
are already being tested: video-tools, multi-media-mail, an 
organizational knowledge base, an activity assistant, or the 
security system SECUDE with chip card terminals for electronic 
signatures. 
  The technical basis of the system will not only be cheaper 
in 
the future, but also considerably more powerful. The most 
important point however: The systems must be so reliable and 
easy to use that they are accepted. 
  This is what GMD wants to test in practice. In the 
Cologne-Bonn area, it is currently working on a project in the 
area of industrial development. A structural development 
company, founded in 1991 on the basis of the Berlin resolution, 
is to insure the future of the region together with several 
industrial developers--soon supported by multimedia functions 
and telecooperation.

<H5>  Arctic Fusion </H5>
  The ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, and climatic 
catastrophes continue to bring the Antarctic publicity as a 
crucible of weather. The fusion achieved between former East and 
West German polar researchers caused less of a sensation. 
  Polar researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar 
and Oceanic Research Bremerhaven made out well during "ceiling 
control," which in plain English means last year's freeze on 
national research institute budgets by the BMFT (Federal 
Ministry for Research and Technology). Mention of their 
participation in the international Global Change Program, which 
is aimed at studying global environmental change, protected them 
from the red pencil. 
  The Germans can make a traditionally significant 
contribution 
to tracking down global changes, especially in the Antarctic. In 
1976, GDR researchers set up their own research station to study 
solar-terrestrial relationships in the Schirmacher Oasis in 
Queen Maud Land, which later was given the name "Georg Forster." 
After the conclusions of this program, isotope physicists and 
chemists from Leipzig, geologists from Potsdam, and 
geomagnetists moved in. 
  The first Federal German station, "Georg von Neumayer," was 
built in 1981. With the German-German fusion of polar research, 
the question arose whether and how operation of the stations 
should be continued. Result: "Forster" is being renovated, but 
in the future it will only be used as a summer base. The budget 
afforded no more, especially since the old Neumayer station on 
the Ekstrom shelf ice in western Antarctica had to be given up 
and replaced by new facilities in 1992. 
  What too seldom works out in other cases went well here. 
East 
German polar research was given an exceptionally positive 
assessment by the Science Council. AWI director Prof. Gotthilf 
Hempel, chairman of the evaluation committee, even raved about 
"a pearl of former GDR Academy research." There was no 
duplication of West German goals. Structurally, of course, there 
were adjustment problems. Earlier, a maximum of six staff 
members of the Academy's Central Institute for Geophysics in 
Potsdam prepared and coordinated the expeditions logistically. 
Scientists from various institutions carried out the research 
itself. After unification, it was decided to expand the Potsdam 
working group to an AWI research center. The staff was increased 
to 40, 20 of whom are scientists. 
  Corresponding to the marine specialization of the AWI parent 
institute, continental activities went to the Potsdam group. In 
addition, atmospheric research using radio-equipped weather 
balloon ascents, radiation measurements, ozone exploration with 
lasers, and spectroscopic detection of aerosols are increasingly 
being undertaken. One group of the Bremerhaven scientists 
involved with this area has moved to Brandenburg. "Certainly the 
long tradition of East German research on the Antarctic 
atmosphere influenced this decision favorably," believes 
research center director Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten. GDR 
scientists, he acknowledges, "were the first to measure the 
vertical structure of the ozone hole continuously with balloon 
probes." This longest and most complete series of measurements 
will be continued in the future at the Neumayer station. "But 
aerological investigations as well as total ozone measurements 
on Spitzbergen will be made and evaluated by us," says 
Hubberten. His goal: To maintain the good image of the Potsdam 
research center and to polish it up with new ideas and findings.

<H5>  Synapse is Faster </H5>
  Neural networks for specific applications on conventional 
computers are already marketable. The trend is towards 
universally applicable neurocomputers made of special hard and 
software. Siemens researchers have developed such a high-power 
computer. 
  The modern broker no longer depends only on his nose. Nor 
must he rely on the supernatural. The computer forecasts stock 
trends for him with greater probability. 
  Conventionally structured computers must suffice for such 
tasks. Complex interrelations of this sort cannot be completely 
described mathematically. The usual devices with von Neumann 
architecture can only process given algorithms sequentially, and 
then only if the input information is complete. 
  It is precisely this handicap which is overcome by specific 
software which imitates the functions of the human brain, the 
neural network. 
  The brain, working together with nerve fibers and sensory 
organs, can comprehend and classify things, even if the input 
information is incomplete. The information is stored 
associatively, i.e. in specific interrelations. This makes the 
brain capable of learning. Since it builds up its connecting 
structures itself in accordance with actual conditions, it is 
also self-organizing. Millions of neurons work as active 
processors, linked by nerve fibers (axons) terminating in 
contact points which are connected in parallel to each other. In 
the brain of an adult human, there are approximately 
10[.sup]13[/] such synapses. 
  A neural network imitates brain function in a greatly 
simplified fashion using mathematical algorithms. Like its human 
counterpart, it is capable of learning and can thus be trained 
to recognize specific patterns. Numerous models were developed 
for this, from the simple algorithm with hardwired neurons to 
models in which the connections are formed by self-organization. 
  First generation applications like the stock market 
forecaster mentioned in the introduction run on powerful 
workstations or other conventional computers. However, real time 
processing of language, processing of moving images and complex 
controls can no longer be carried out in this way. Therefore the 
trend in hardware is towards special components and chips 
(ASICS), which are significantly faster. 
  Heretofore, solutions have been tailor-made for special uses 
and have not been universally applicable. 
  Therefore, at the Central Research Department of Siemens AG 
in Munich they have gone one step further with a two-year 
project on the SYNAPSE-1 neurocomputer. 
  "Our goal," says the director of the development team, Dr. 
Ulrich Ramacher, "was to build a neural special computer on 
which the simulation of any desired neural networks and learning 
algorithms is possible." The Munich researchers have used a 
new system architecture for the neurocomputer, developed the 
MA-16 signal processor, and created their own software. Prior to 
this, various network models were analyzed. Dr. Ramacher: "The 
analysis showed that there are 25 different compute-bound basic 
operations for which it is worth developing a special chip. That 
is what we have done." 
  The result is the largest pure logic chip developed at 
Siemens. It has 610,000 transistors on an area two centimeters 
square. Its more than 200 connections and clock frequency of 50 
MHz allow an input-output rate of 10.9 gigabits per second. At 
the same time, the architecture of SYNAPSE-1 was so designed 
from the beginning that processor performance and memory size 
can be adapted to specific applications. 
  Dr. Ramacher is proud that SYNAPSE-1 is at least 8,000 times 
faster than conventional solutions. One hour of computing time 
on the neurocomputer corresponds to 8,000 hours on the latest 
SUN-Workstation. At this year's CeBIT in Hannover, Siemens 
researchers showed a sample application in which eight 
incomplete images were reconstructed in 62 milliseconds. For one 
such image, a workstation would have taken longer than two 
minutes.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenther Ludvik: "Beautiful Bride"] </F>
  [Text] A dream becomes reality, exults Hans-Juergen Thaus, 
chairman of the board of Schneider Rundfunkwerke AG, Tuerkheim. 
Home movies "with a screen measuring in square meters, which 
shows even the smallest details of the picture with unimagined 
sharpness and the whole range of colors." 
  It will be a few years until this happens, however. 
Initially, the 50-man development crew at Schneider in Allgaeu 
presented only a prototype of the new television generation, 
after five years of work and expenditures amounting to double 
digit millions. It works with expensive gaseous lasers and needs 
a cooling unit the size of an armoire. Although not ready for 
the market for a long time yet, the technological achievement 
itself is described as "considerable" by entertainment 
electronics giants. The industry is urgently in need of 
innovations in order to revive the market. In Germany, after the 
unification boom, sales of color televisions dropped from 5.75 
million units last year to no more than 5.5 million this year. 
  Laser TVs, although not an entirely new idea, would arrive 
right on time. The technology sounds simple but it is bulky: 
Using a red-green-blue laser beam bundle, a projector shows 
colored images on a screen, analogous to today's picture tubes, 
in which electron beams are modulated by the video signal and 
conducted in rows across the screen. However, precisely this 
control is causing problems with the laser technology. 
  What works in the picture tube with changing magnetic fields 
does not work with laser light. It can be done with mechanical 
methods, such as mirrors, but the required speeds are extremely 
high. With an ordinary television picture the pixels write 25 
times 625 rows per second, equalling 15,624 times across the 
screen. For HDTV [high-definition television] or flickerless 
100-Hertz images, which are the future particularly for 
large-screen projection, they must be twice as fast. Schneider's 
R&amp;D chief, Guenther Elster, and project leader Christhard 
Deter 
insist that they have mastered these technologies. However, the 
micromechanical know-how will not be revealed until all patents 
have been secured. 
  It is conceivable that small polygons will be used as 
mirrors, which rotate or swing around their axis. This 
beam-deflection technique requires intermediate storage of the 
image information in a digital memory, which passes them on in 
correspondingly modified timing to the laser. A great deal must 
still be done, above all for the laser technology. Only 
semiconductor-diode lasers can offer small size and low prices 
per unit. They have proved themselves in large-scale technology, 
for example in CD systems. "For the colors red and green the 
light intensities obtained today are already in the range of 
data specified for multilaser projection technology," says 
Professor Gunther Krieg, Dr. of engineering. For blue-light 
systems, however, "solutions can only be expected in the next 
two years." 
  Thus, the first projection units in video recorder format 
for 
DM 3,000 could be available three years from now, at the 
earliest, in the opinion of Hans-Juergen Thaus. Middle-size 
enterprises do not have the staying-power and, above all, the 
financial strength to develop laser projection until it is ripe 
for the market. Schneider is therefore looking for partners in 
the industry, but there is mostly skepticism. Many contracting 
parties have already been involved with similar technologies but 
given up. At least half a dozen other companies could also 
demonstrate that the idea in principle does function. But if 
laser TV were to break through, most would have to worry about 
their large capacities in the production of picture tubes or LCD 
displays. 
  Nevertheless, the PR show has had a positive effect for 
Schneider: The value of a share, which was introduced in 1986 at 
a price of DM 540 and which had meanwhile plummeted to DM 
112.50, in early August climbed to DM 423. Thaus is now hoping 
that a U.S. company with a lot of capital will step in: "After 
the world premiere, the bride has become a great deal more 
beautiful."

<F P=106> [Article: "New EC Proposal on HDTV Transmission Standards"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels--The European Commission [EC] is going to 
propose a new directive (Europe-wide law) on high-definition 
television (HDTV) to promote popularization of wide-format 
television (16/9 width-height ratio) that will be applicable 
independent of the transmission standard used, according to 
Community sources. 
  This new proposal follows the Twelve's decision last June to 
promote wide-screen television in the HDTV action program and 
abandon any reference to a single, mandatory transmission 
standard. Initially, the Commission had planned to make the 
D2-MAC and High Definition-MAC (HD-MAC) standards obligatory. 
  The new proposal, to be submitted to member states on 7 
December, provides that television services transmitted to 
viewers by cable, satellite, or ground-based broadcasting 
stations must utilize either D2-MAC or a transmission system 100 
percent compatible with PAL or SECAM standards. Among other 
things, that should permit use of the German "PAL Plus" standard 
now under development. 
  For services not fully digitized, the Commission proposal 
endorses the HD-MAC transmission system. Experts expect digital 
transmission standards to evolve rapidly in the coming years. 
The Commission stipulates however that digital transmission 
systems will have to be "standardized by a European 
standardization body." 
  The proposed directive also says that "any wide-format 
(16/9) 
television service that is picked up and rebroadcast by cable 
systems must be rebroadcast in the wide (16/9) format."

"Telecommunications Techniques, Prospects"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Perceived Need </H5>
  In the Gulf War as well as in the landing in Somalia, news 
reporters had extremely advanced communications resources, at 
first glance, more advanced than those of the military. But 
those two examples -- the tip of a deeply submerged iceberg -- 
are not representative of all the events and their diversity. To 
set up their own communications, the military could not rely 
upon the technical, political and economic opportunities that 
made possible the extraordinary media coverage of recent 
operations. 
  The military telecommunications system of the year 2010 will 
not entail the mere transfer of civilian solutions in gestation 
at France Telecom or in the research laboratories of the major 
French, European, U.S., or Japanese industries. 
  Civilian telecommunications currently are already displaying 
typical features of a basically market-oriented development. 
Areas having heavy population density or generating large 
volumes of traffic are and increasingly will be emphasized. 
Investments, too, will be concentrated on the most "profitable" 
communications services. In contrast, the military has to be 
able to communicate from everywhere to anywhere and with 
anyone . They will have to be guaranteed a full-spectrum 
leading-edge service no matter how heterogeneous the resources 
rendered operative. Defined in this way, their requirements are 
too varied to be met fully and directly by off-the-shelf 
purchasing of such products or civilian systems. 
  Civilian investments, however, are not comparable to those 
authorized by the armed forces. For this reason, if the military 
telecommunications system, a meta-system harmoniously and 
effectively incorporating the "fixed" segment and the "tactical" 
segments, relies on the humongous technological effort that the 
telecommunications industry has made, it will incorporate 
developments appropriate for meeting specific requirements. 
<H5>  Future Trap </H5>
  Technological progress will lead to an unprecedented 
development of data exchanges. An easy way to conjure up 
tomorrow's telecommunications is based on France Telecom's 
Eurodisney attraction entitled It's a Small World . 
In a scaled-down world, the latter displays a host of 
individuals who spend virtually all their time on the telephone 
or watching cartoons. Will technology enable everyone at any 
time to have all the data that one could wish to receive at the 
risk of no longer being able to choose among the data that will 
be submitted to that individual? Will the military itself not be 
overwhelmed by the load of available data and, mesmerized by the 
data, become incapable of making decisions and taking action? 
Will the world of telecommunications be the golden age that 
humanity dreams of or will it be a nightmare? 
<H5>  Reduced Distances and Technological Innovation </H5>
  In the near future all transmittable signals will be in 
digital form. The transfer rates necessary for the different 
services will be highly varied, going from a few bits per second 
to tens of megabits per second. The transfer rates needed for 
different source codings will be heavily dependent on the 
desired quality. Music coding will be done for transfer rates 
varying in a ratio of 10. For speech, the ratio will approach 
100. For images it will exceed 1,000, including videophone and 
the high-quality television necessary for productive societies. 
The transfer rate for data transmissions, in turn, will be 
limited only by computer memory access times. The rapid 
escalation of communications capacity will lead to a 
considerable subjective reduction of distances. A distant 
correspondent will be as easy to reach as the neighbor down the 
hall. 
  Optical fiber is now being used in transatlantic cables. The 
TAT 9 cable that was put into service in 1991 between Europe and 
the U.S., makes it possible to transmit 560Mbits/s. In 1995, TAT 
12 will make it possible to transmit 5 Gbits/s, that is, 60,000 
telephone communications. In the laboratory, the National Center 
for Telecommunications Studies [CNET] is experimenting with a 20 
Gbits/s 108 km link. For sure, before the year 2,000, 100 
Gbits/s will be realized with multi-color systems, that is, 
employing several optical wave lengths. 
  Satellites will mainly be used for the broadcasting of 
images. For data transmission or telephone channels, the 
increasing congestion of the geostationary orbit and the 
saturation of the spectrum will increasingly lead to reserving 
the use of digital telecommunications satellites for covering 
the oceans and desert areas. Possible development of clusters of 
low-orbit satellites is not likely to check this trend. 
  It will be difficult to transfer this development into the 
military sector, nor is it certain that there is a real need to 
do so. The innovative technologies that will directly interest 
the military and impact its transmission system will be those 
being investigated for radio broadcasting and digital radio 
telephony for mobile units. 
  In effect, the features of the modulation that is used make 
it possible to counter radio channel distortions. Digital 
Audio Broadcasting [DAB], undergoing experimentation, will 
surely be the first application of that technology for digital 
radio broadcasting. It will therefore be possible on a single 
transmitter to multiplex six different stereophonic programs and 
to transmit 1.3 Mbits/s in a 1.5 MHz channel. 
  What is more, all transmitters broadcasting the same group 
of 
stations will use the same frequency. That will noticeably 
reduce the congestion of the spectrum and even do away with the 
concept of frequency plan. The same principles will soon be 
applied to television. It will be possible to transmit 5-20 
Mbits/s in a current TV channel to fixed or mobile receivers. 
There too, multiplexing of several programs on a single 
transmitter will be possible. 
  Even if protection against electronic warfare might restrict 
the effectiveness of the subsets of a military 
telecommunications system using such solutions, the interest 
that such techniques could afford for broadcasting data to 
forces deployed in theaters of operation can be imagined. 
  Concurrently, mobile radio telephony will continue to 
develop. Systems like Itineris, based on the GSM 
[Global System for Mobile Communication] standard, will be 
supplemented by new systems occupying other frequency bands. 
Wireless telephones like Bi-Bop will be increasingly 
used. Wireless local-network and private switches will emerge. 
  Ultimately, short-range links with mobile units will develop 
around various applications: navigation and traffic control, as 
with Prometheus, automatic toll collecting, or even 
detection of stolen vehicles. 
  To be sure, military systems will resort to the same 
techniques without necessarily realizing the same effectiveness 
since they will have to be shielded against the occurrence of 
electronic countermeasures and incorporate data security. 
<H5>  Frequency Spectrum Management </H5>
  Frequencies are a very rare commodity. Civilian pressure on 
the military is already strong and could even intensify since 
the new market shares that use of frequencies currently 
allocated to the military represent for civilian operators are 
quite sizable. Besides the scarcity of military bandwidths, 
being side-by-side with a very large number of civilian systems 
and involuntary disturbance phenomena will require the 
introduction of a very strict management of frequency usage, 
transmitting powers and a very precise definition of radio 
equipment features. 
<H5>  Forwarding of Data </H5>
  Conceivably, use of rapid packet switching technology or 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode [ATM], adopted in the 
combined forces Socrate system, will become 
widespread. All the data to be transmitted will be submitted in 
a single fixed-length format that is especially well suited for 
real-time switching. With the upsurge in data transmissions 
among computers, the required transfer rates will be 
increasingly large and sporadic. 
  The very broad heterogeneity of the channels making up the 
military transmitting system -- optical fibers, satellite links, 
Hertzian link-ups -- will be even further intensified by the 
presence of degraded modes during electronic warfare. 
  The switching system capable of optimizing the use of all 
such transmitting resources will be extremely complex. An 
increasing amount of transmission channel capacity will be 
dedicated to management data exchanges. In effect, it will 
require transmission of all the data needed for operating the 
services proposed for users and system supervision. In military 
systems that are simultaneously adaptable, reconfigurable in 
real time shielded against intrusions, the development of 
switches will be especially difficult. In fact, the switching 
system will be a major shared computerized application. Already 
in Rita, the option made was to make the software 
more complex in order to facilitate deployment of the system and 
its operation. This trend will be continued with ease of 
operation for the user always being the underlying parameter to 
be emphasized. 
<H5>  Civilian Sector Services </H5>
  Standardization of transmission channels combined with 
increasing software programming is going to lead to a 
diversification of services. Initially, source coding will be 
increasingly suited to each application: wide-band sound, 
video-conferencing image coding, color facsimile coding, etc. A 
number of those signals could be combined in a transmission 
channel to create a multimedia service. 
  Subscriber mobility, a service originally offered by the 
lone 
tactical system Rita, will become a reality in 
civilian systems and all military systems. 
  An apparently complete freedom of movement for subscribers 
will result from the development of Hertzian link-ups. 
  At present, systems having a shorter range like Bi-Bop are 
surfacing. Micro-cellular system design with a 200 m or less 
close-in range is emerging. Its short range is offset by the 
universal availability of terminals for connecting to an optical 
fiber based wire system. Since users are unaware of the constant 
changing of their connecting terminal they therefore have a 
feeling of absolute freedom in their movement and the impression 
of an unlimited range for their portable telephone. 
  To conjure up the impact that the telecommunications 
development could have on our lifestyle, let us imagine a 
Parisian on vacation somewhere in the heartland of France in the 
year 2,010. His car's on-board computer takes him unswervingly 
to the sight, described in his travel guide, that he decided to 
go admire. On the way back to his hotel he decides to take a 
route through the woods. Covering hardly 100 meters, an alarm 
points out to him that he is no longer on a listed roadway. A 
few meters further on, his radio telephone informs him that, 
without a satellite terminal, he has lost all "civilized" 
contact and will not be able to be rescued in the event of an 
accident. 
  What will the effectively developed services be? Will they 
help improve the quality of life? Those are the real stakes in 
this impressive technological development. What will the 
behavior and reactions of the military personnel be, who, in 
civilian life will be "conditioned" by such an environment? The 
outlook in this sector continues to be quite difficult! 
<H5>  Specifically Military Services </H5>
  In the military systems, the impressive transmission 
capabilities made possible by the technology will facilitate 
broadcasting to the lowest command levels, even to the troops, 
intelligence in the form of texts, sounds, or images. Command 
systems likewise will be able to receive all the data they will 
need. In exchange, such systems will have to merge increasing 
amounts of data. 
  An increasing de-localization of functions will be noticed 
as 
well as the emergence of shared weapons systems whose elements, 
specialized by function, will cooperate for the extent of a 
mission. Already, during operation Desert Storm, 
computing the necessary elements for aiming the 
Patriot missiles was done in the U.S. on the basis of 
data collected by the various available sensors. Is it to be 
feared that all decisions will be made by a staff, far removed 
from ground truth? Be that as it may, telecommunications 
flexibility will facilitate the development of designs for the 
employment of forces. But it should never be forgotten that 
electronic warfare will bare any blind alley or indiscretion 
made in the design stage and that there is no allowance for 
error. 
  If the geographic spread of conflicts requires increased 
interoperability with civilian systems, it will also be 
necessary to be able to dispense with local infrastructures that 
have been destroyed or that are in the hands of non-controlled 
elements. 
<H5>  Standardization in the Civilian World </H5>
  In upcoming years, the intense creativity of 
telecommunications, on the digital signal processing level, 
equipment or systems and systems and services will engender two 
opposed movements. First, the proliferation of concepts will 
lead to the development of mutually incompatible technologies. 
It will be hard to choose among them. Second, the complexity of 
the systems will require the new products to adhere to precise 
standards enabling their introduction into the systems. That 
holds for equipment as well as services even if the so-called 
"smart system" structure will ease their introduction by making 
it possible to export the necessary software in the servers. 
  In the civilian world, the "deregulatory" movement launched 
in imitation of the U.S., could lead to a diversification of 
technical options among competing operators. Absent a firm 
policy aimed at requiring systems interoperability, the result 
could be a lowering of the quality of service in the eyes of the 
customers. If the operators are dynamic enough, the emergence of 
de facto standards will be noticed, as in computers, and, with 
the interplay of alliances, the establishment of very large 
transnational groups on the international level. Otherwise, 
initial commercial failure will delay development. 
  In London, for example, cut-throat competition among four 
operators caused an initial attempt at introducing a BI-BOP type 
service to flop while it enjoyed absolute success in Paris. In 
turn, development of the pan-European GSM radio telephone 
demonstrates that voluntary awareness by all the economic 
players of the interoperability problems can lead to a major 
industrial and commercial success while allowing operators to 
multiply. Therefore, standardization is an extremely major stake 
in the future of civilian telecommunications. 
  In military systems the interplay is unquestionably even 
more 
complex. To hold down development costs, it has to be able to 
derive maximum benefit from the investments made in the civilian 
world while allowing for military specifications: security, 
confidentiality, shielding against electronic warfare. That is 
possible only if the military, considered as a minority 
operator, participates in one form or another in the elaboration 
of civilian standards. Too frequently, a haphazard selection at 
the commencement of the standardization process makes it easy or 
impossible later to adapt the products to military requirements. 
The basic options, therefore, should be made with an awareness 
of the case. 
  Unlike what happens in other sectors, in telecommunications, 
the definition of standards precedes the development of the 
prototypes. Systems or services conjured up the engineers are 
specified and then standardized before springing into existence. 
Except in rare sectors not involving interoperability, 
innovation no longer can arise from an individual initiative but 
from a consensus that is all the more difficult to realize 
because the interests of the different parties are frequently at 
odds. The ability to persuade, therefore, is becoming an 
essential quality in engineers, an indispensable supplement to 
their technical expertise. 
  Telecommunications already have greatly impacted our 
lifestyle. In the past, the telephone radically altered the 
relationships among individuals. Presently, the fax is 
transforming our work style by eliminating the mail carrier's 
delivery routes and abolishing delays in the transmission of 
documents. In the future, when the videophone becomes less 
expensive, it too will alter social behaviors. 
  In the civilian world, development will occur because of a 
compromise between the disorder stemming from the development of 
new designs and engineering consistency that is the only thing 
able to allow different correspondents wishing to communicate to 
make themselves understood. Development will no longer be 
limited by engineering possibilities, but rather by the slowness 
of the standardization process, the investment burden to be 
amortized or even the difficulty in realizing a threshold of 
profitability for a new service. 
  Military systems should supply quality services comparable 
in 
all respects to those offered by their civilian counterparts. 
Even more than in the past, those in charge of developing 
military systems will not tolerate anything less than total 
availability for the transmissions they will require. 
  Only military systems are designed to completely dispense 
with the support of local infrastructures. Equipment manufacture 
in small series and durable in a very hostile environment cannot 
be compared to unshielded civilian systems. On the other hand, 
they should be interoperable with them in order to be able to 
afford the military optimum effectiveness under all 
circumstances. Military telecommunications have to remain 
operational in a major conflict. They will benefit from the 
development of civilian telecommunications but there will be no 
correspondence between the services offered by civilian 
telecommunications and the requirements of the military. 
Therefore, the systems cannot be identical. 
  In this article terminals have been dealt with only through 
the intermediary of the services. By the year 2,010, what will 
the user interface look like? In a period of office 
communications what will the operational modes be that will be 
deemed ergonomic by the next generation? A further unresolved 
issue: besides civilian systems, with what others will it have 
to be interoperable?

<F P=106> [Article by Volker Fink: "Start in the Mass Market"] </F>
  [Text] The connection of ISDN [Integrated Services Digital 
network] had developed into a sought-after product on the German 
telecommunications market. The official startup of Euro-ISDN in 
December will give the digital network an additional boost. 
  In the past years a number of countries have introduced 
ISDN. 
But there were no extensive ISDN standards, so that various 
performance characteristics and features were being used for 
connections in the individual countries. Above all, local ISDN 
terminal equipment and applications were confined to use in each 
country, so that each country developed its own terminal 
equipment. The result of this greatly limited the marketing 
opportunities, which also led to low production numbers and 
relatively high unit prices. 
  In order to counteract these problems, 26 network operators 
from 20 European countries have committed themselves to 
introduce an ISDN based on a uniform European standard by the 
end of 1993. Telekom has also signed this agreement. It was 
determined that every network operator should offer both basic 
and primary multiplex connections. In addition, a minimum of 
services and performance features must be supported. Beyond 
that, however, every network operator is free to offer 
additional performance features, but he must use the 
international standards. The minimum range includes: 


    -  64 kbit/s transmission service (transparent 
transmission of 64 kbit/s without limitation), 
  -  3.1 kHz audio transmission service, 
  -  transmission of the calling number to the subscriber called, 
  -  suppression of transmission of the calling number 
  -  digital information display through to the extension in 
telecommunications facilities, 
  -  multiple number dialing 
  -  interchanging at the passive bus of the multiple equipment 
connection. 

    With Euro-ISDN the user thus has the advantage in the future 
of being able to use a large, high-capacity, and inexpensive 
international range of terminal equipment. 
  It has already been established that this is not just a 
future vision. Thus, as of January 1994 Telekom will offer a 
modern Euro-ISDN telephone at the cost of not quite 300 German 
marks [DM], which can be used with all current Euro-ISDN 
performance features. Small ISDN telecommunications facilities 
at a cost of DM 1,000 will be available approximately in 
mid-1994, and many experts anticipate that the price of passive 
ISDN PC adapter cards will shortly drop to about DM 200. 
  Another important advantage with Euro-ISDN lies in the users 
being able to employ their ISDN applications and communications 
solutions without change in various countries, which greatly 
simplifies international communication. 
<H5>  Introduction of Euro-ISDN in Germany </H5>
  Telekom began to implement Euro-ISDN in its network in 
August 
1993. The only thing needed to make Euro-ISDN available is to 
change the software at the switching center. Hardware changes at 
the switching centers or the subscriber's network end is not 
necessary. The introduction of Euro-ISDN is so simple because 
international compatibility involves only signalling on the 
access line, the D-channel protocol. 
  For technical reasons the introduction of the new software 
can only take place in stages, however, so that Euro-ISDN will 
not be available nationwide until April 1994. In regions where 
the work has been completed, customers can already be connected 
before that. The startup of regular operation took place on 1 
December 1993. 
  With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom will offer both 
the national (1TR6) and the European D-channel protocols (DSS-1) 
in its network. Each user can then decide whether he wants to 
use an ISDN connection with the national or the European 
standard. This applies to both existing connections and to new 
installations. The conversion takes place individually for each 
connection at the switching center. No changes are necessary at 
the network port. For connections between ports with various 
protocols, the conversion is carried out by the network. 
  How long national ISDN will remain part of the features 
offered will be determined mainly by market requirements. 
Telekom plans to offer the choice between ISDN connections with 
national or European protocols until the year 2000. 
<H5>  `Bilingual' ISDN Base Terminal </H5>
  Due to the different D-channel protocols, a 1TR6 terminal 
unit cannot be operated with a Euro-ISDN port. Conversely, it is 
also not possible to operate a Euro-ISDN terminal unit with a 
1TR6 connection. Since Telekom will offer both D-channel 
protocols simultaneously in its network, and the customer 
himself can decide which standard he wants to use, this 
limitation is not significant with only one end unit. This 
applies in particular to ISDN connections of telecommunications 
facilities and computer centers. 
  With Euro-ISDN Telekom will also offer a bilingual basic 
connection for multiequipment configuration (basic connection 
with passive bus), in which both standards are available 
simultaneously. For this a modified network port must be 
installed at the subscriber's which uses the European D-channel 
protocol toward the ISDN switching center and at the subscriber 
network interface (S[.sup]0[/] interface), in addition to the 
European D-channel protocol, also the 1TR6 protocol. This makes 
it possible to operate terminals with the national and European 
standard at the same time with one and the same basic connection. 
  Bilingual primary multiplex connections are not possible for 
technical reasons and are therefore also not planned. If a 
telecommunications facility is connected through several ISDN 
ports, however, some of the ports could use the European 
D-channel protocol and the other ports the 1TR6 protocol. 
<H5>  Services and Service Features with Euro-ISDN </H5>
  With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom offers a 
spectrum 
of services and service features which are clearly above the 
minimum range required. There will be many performance features 
which are not in the national ISDN and which make new 
applications possible. Some performance characteristics will 
also have new properties which permit even more comfortable 
communication. An example of this is "multiple dialing." 
  This feature replaces the previously well-known "terminal 
selector character." With the terminal selector character it was 
possible to select each equipment specifically in the event 
several terminals are connected to an ISDN port. While in 
1TR6-ISDN exactly 10 numbers are available in ascending order at 
a multiequipment port with the addition of another position to 
the ISDN call number, in Euro-ISDN up to 10 numbers can be 
defined as multiple call numbers. These can be any free numbers 
from the volume of call numbers at the switching center. This 
means that when changing over to Euro-ISDN the customer can keep 
his previous call number if he is already connected to a digital 
switching center. Basically, one can say that the service 
features of the national ISDN are connection-related, while in 
Euro-ISDN they are call number-related. For the user this has 
the advantage that he can use the service features for each 
multiple call number separately. Example: In rerouting a call, 
the entire connection is no longer transferred; instead, various 
rerouting destinations can be entered for each multiple number 
dialled. 
  Additional features will be added over the next few years. 
In 
addition to three-party conferencing, special mention may be 
made of "partial rerouting" which will be available after 
1994/95. With this feature rerouting calls from 
telecommunications installations will be possible for each 
individual extension. 
  The "reserved permanent connection" feature (old name: 
semipermanent fixed connection), for which there is still no 
European standard at this time, will not be offered so far. 
"Three-party conferencing" will not be possible to use until the 
end of 1994. 
<H5>  Euro-ISDN Rates </H5>
  Regarding ISDN rates it is necessary to distinguish between 
connection rates for basic and primary multiplex connections and 
for traffic rates. The traffic rates correspond to the normal 
analog telephone connection. For that it does not matter whether 
you call or send text, images, and data. There will be no 
service-based rates. Telekom thereby differs from some other 
countries, in which non-voice communication carries different 
and in part higher charges than voice transmission. 
  However, the Euro-ISDN connection involves a new product 
with 
new features. That is the reason why Euro-ISDN rates are 
different from the rates for national ISDN. Basically, there 
will be separate tariff items for a Euro-ISDN connection without 
features, as well as for all features which can be switched on 
separately. Telekom is obligated to do this based on directives 
from the Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunication and 
the EC Commission. For reasons of handling and clarity, two cost 
packages are planned in which ISDN connection and features are 
bundled. The two packages offered are called ISDN Standard 
Connection and ISDN Comfort Connection and are offered in the 
basic connection variant at DM 64 and 69. At these rates the 
basic Euro-ISDN connection is DM 10 cheaper than the national 
connection variant. 
<H5>  Access to X.25 Networks </H5>
  Euro-ISDN will not only offer new performance features but 
also the foundation for flexible and inexpensive communication. 
An example of this is access to X.25 networks over the B and D 
channel of the ISDN connection, for which Telekom will create 
the preconditions based on Euro-ISDN. Access through the D 
channel of the basic connection is particularly attractive for 
many applications. 
  The D channel is basically reserved for the signalling of 
the 
connection. Information transmission in this channel is 
packet-oriented and takes place with a transmission speed of 16 
kbit/s. Only a part of this transmission capacity is needed for 
signalling, so that the rest is available for transmission of 
"useful information." 
  An ISDN customer can thus operate his basic connection 
independent of the use of the B channels as a X.25 connection. 
The access through the D channel is suitable for transmission 
speeds of up to 9600 bit/s. For higher speeds a B channel must 
be used. 
  If a user would also like to utilize his ISDN connection as 
a 
packet network connection, he must pay for the use of this 
feature in addition to the monthly base rate for the ISDN 
connection. Connection charges in ISDN are not included in the 
present concept, but the rates for each X.25 network are added. 
Access through the D channel of the basic connection will 
presumably be very inexpensive. As of right now, operation is 
likely to begin in the second quarter of 1994. 
  The intended technical solution primarily offers advantages 
for applications in which only small data quantities must be 
transmitted per connection and which also have other 
communications needs. Among them may be mentioned the electronic 
cash systems in retail sales or booking systems in travel 
agencies. The advantage is that the users do not have to acquire 
several different telecommunication ports for language 
communication and data transmission, which leads to more 
flexibility and, above all, savings.

<F P=106> [Article by Adrian Morant: "From Janet to Super-Janet"] </F>
  [Text] For a decade the local area networks (LANs) at 
approximately 200 universities, polytechnic colleges and 
research institutions in Great Britain have been connected to 
one another through Janet (Joint Academic Network). Janet was 
installed in the early 1980s, currently serves about 50,000 
terminals and offers access to electronic mail services around 
the world. 
  This system is now being improved by means of the most 
modern 
optical waveguide technology so that in addition to its existing 
function as a news transmission medium it will also function as 
a future-oriented communications structure for the academic 
community. The new improved network by the name of Super-Janet 
is needed to support certain teaching and research activities. 
In addition to language transmission, they also require rapid 
data, image and video transmission. Super-Janet will not replace 
the existing network but expand it. 
<H5>  Powerful Overlay Network </H5>
  The new network will not radically change the type and way 
in 
which scientists access decentralized data bases and routinely 
communicate by E-mail with their colleagues all over the world. 
But it will create a significantly more powerful overlay 
network, to which gradually more and more facilities all over 
the country will be connected. After the development of similar 
networks in other countries, new perspectives will open up on 
this level as well. 
  Dr. Robert Cooper, who heads the project for the Science and 
Engineering Research Council/Universities Funding Council Joint 
Network Team, regards Super-Janet as "singular in Europe." In 
explaining the pioneering role of the new network, he adds that 
it involves a test system for the demanding academic community. 
  The British Universities Funding Council (UFC) awarded the 
contract, worth 18 million pounds over a period of four years, 
to British Telecom (BT). In the first phase data centers at the 
Universities of Cambridge and Manchester, Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory, University College London (UCL), at Imperial College 
London and the University of Edinburgh will be interconnected. 
In the course of 1993/94 about 50 locations will be connected to 
the network. Additional ones will follow, according to the 
availability of the necessary funds. 
  The network concept will be realized by means of the latest 
broadband technology. Most communications opportunities are 
based on the Switched Multimegambit Data Service Definition 
(SMDS) by BT. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is to be 
used as a central network technology, which together with new 
broadband transmission methods (Distributed Queue Dual Bus, 
DQDB, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode, ATM) will offer a maximum 
of transmission opportunities. 
  Dr. Alan Rudge, head of BT's research and procurement 
division, who is responsible for all the company's technical 
research work, stresses that the broadband transmission platform 
used to interconnect the locations is just as important for the 
industry as for government offices and academics: "The 
Super-Janet order enables BT, together with the universities, to 
develop new applications which sooner or later will bring the 
companies a competitive advantage." 
  Dr. Rudge further refers to the necessity of promoting the 
image of "broadband as the standard." According to his 
information, BT is proposing to the industry that it should 
participate in joint projects with the suppliers in order to 
offer these facilities. A critical mass is needed in order to 
stimulate confidence. BT therefore expects that the availability 
of the network will have a decisive "trigger function." 
<H5>  Broad Application Range </H5>
  Transmission of visual output data from extensive, 
fluid-dynamic calculations executed at the Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory near London on a Cray YMP supercomputer to Imperial 
College in London is one potential technical application. Since 
the enormous amounts of data produced can only be processed by 
the user if they are present in image form--often with color and 
animation--Super-Janet offers the advantage that the researchers 
no longer personally have to go to the Rutherford laboratory. 
  The Cyclotron Unit of the MRC (Medical Research Council) at 
Hammersmith Hospital in London also have several facilities for 
producing pictures of the brain, which are of interest to 
researchers in other places. In the pilot project these pictures 
are transmitted for analysis from Hammersmith Hospital to the 
psychiatric departments of the University of Edinburgh and the 
University College London as well as for processing by the 
supercomputer center at the University of Edinburgh. 
  University College London has the equipment for teaching 
surgery by means of interactive video. For that reason a 
proposal was made to carry out a series of surgical 
demonstrations between the UCL and the other centers which are 
able to support interactive activities. These can be for example 
surgical demonstrations from the operating room, clinical 
demonstrations in the lecture room, discussions between surgical 
specialists, joint preparation of video-teaching material and 
investigation of possibilities to use existing teaching 
materials for self-study in a decentralized teaching environment. 
  Among the applications in the field of information services 
are preparation of archival documents and a test project for an 
electronic magazine, as well as a series of applications which 
require rapid transfer of voluminous data from one place to 
another. The former application is to demonstrate inquiry for 
and preparation of documents with the network. At least seven 
universities will participate in order ultimately to establish a 
regular service between the locations. This method is more 
economical than the existing slow and personnel-intensive 
borrowing agreements between the libraries. 
  Super-Janet will enable a multitude of projects--in the most 
varied disciplines--which are being postponed at this time for 
lack of a suitable fast network. Furthermore, with every 
successful application the advantages of Super-Janet are 
becoming noticed by an increasingly larger circle of users.

<F P=106> ["Optical Communications with Satellites: Carl Zeiss Jena </F>
Technology Supports ARTEMIS Data Transmission"] 
  [Text] VDI-N Jena, 10 December 93, M.S. - When the ARTEMIS 
satellite is launched in 1996, the ESA (European Space Agency) 
will make practical tests of the effectiveness of laser 
technology in providing communications between the space 
vehicles themselves and between the satellites and the ground 
station. In late November, Carl Zeiss Jena will have delivered 
the one-meter mirror telescope to be used for this purpose at 
the ground station situated on the Tenerife volcanic massif. 
  In three years, when the ESA's ARTEMIS research satellite, 
equipped with the necessary transceiver module, has been put 
into a geostationary orbit, one of the most promising projects 
of European space research of this decade, designated Silex 
(Semiconductor Intersatellite Link Experiment) will get 
underway. For the first time in the civilian domain data will be 
transmitted directly via laser pulses between the French 
Earth-surveillance satellite Spot 4 and ARTEMIS. On board each 
satellite will be a 25-cm receiving mirror and laser operating 
in the 820-nm light wavelength band. In addition, using the same 
system, ARTEMIS will also be able to transmit the signals 
received further on to the ground station in the Canary Islands. 
From the Canaries, the data can then be transmitted by light 
waveguide, copper cable, or radio, whichever method is 
preferred, to subscribers worldwide. 
  German companies, too, especially Carl Zeiss Jena, which is 
responsible for the optical elements in Silex, have received 
important contracts through Dara (German Space Agency) for this 
project that will, providing the general tests with ARTEMIS are 
successful, be continued from late 1998 with the first 
commercial communications satellites. On the occasion of the 
delivery to Dara of the telescope, Dr. Elk Zittow, business 
manager, stated frankly: "This has been an enormously important 
contract for our astronomical instrumentation branch, which is 
currently being rebuilt." The instrument, which cost roughly 2 
million German marks [DM], is one of 14 contracts that the 
company is presently working on for the space program. It had 
been originally destined for an astronomical observatory in 
Kazakhstan. Since the original customer was no longer able to 
pay, Zeiss Jena modified the telescope for its new use. Anthony 
Dickinson, associated with ESA's technology center, sees many 
advantages in the use of laser light, which has already found 
many applications on the Earth. If free transmission is 
successful in orbit, not only would a reduction in energy use 
become possible through the better beaming of light but a 
greater degree of resistance to interference as well will be 
achieved. Moreover, the limitations on the available radio 
frequencies and their limited transmission capacity have 
compelled the search for such new approaches. 
  Dr. Fritz Merkle, Carl Zeiss business manager, expressed it 
this way: "An enormously important contract for our company, 
whose astronomy technology department, now being built up and 
directed in Jena, possesses technological know-how from both the 
West's and the East's space programs." 
  This participation in the European Silex Project is also a 
helpful contribution to the ongoing debate concerning Germany's 
competitiveness as a desirable industrial site. As Prof. Ralf 
Joachim, deputy business at Dara, put it: "In recent years there 
has been a double digit growth rate in the electronic satellite 
communications field internationally. Regrettably it has passed 
Germany by." Joachim continued: "We have to break away from our 
present `sub-critical' presence in the ESA; the successful 
engagement in Silex provides grounds for careful optimism." 
  Space research and technology, which is sometimes criticized 
and repeatedly threatened by funding cut-backs, truly advanced 
economic developments, especially in telecommunications. In 
Prof. Joachim's opinion, satellite-based data transmission plays 
"a key role in maintaining and expanding the competitiveness of 
our service and technological industries." A study prepared by 
the Euroconsult Company estimates that the world-wide market 
volume for civilian satellite communications systems will reach 
US$79 billion dollars in the coming decade, of which $55 billion 
alone will be for on-board systems. Of the approximately 144 new 
satellites to be built in this time frame, about 36 will 
originate in Europe. 
  It is Dara's conviction that German industry has--through 
its 
own efforts and with some outside funding--produced some 
outstanding achievements, such as Kopernikus, TV-Sat, and 
Symphonie, although, it must be admitted, with less satisfactory 
commercial spin-offs than hoped for. However, the competition 
remains very uneven because the United States and other 
countries can help support their space programs through high 
military development outlays and government technological 
programs. Consequently, German companies have to be especially 
innovative and advance new technologies. Optical communications 
represents one shining example of just such a new technology. 
  The ARTEMIS scenario, which ESA believes will become the 
reality after the successful conclusion of the test phase in 
late 1998, should bring urgently needed advantages for 
low-flying Earth reconnaissance satellites and for manned space 
flights as well. The ARTEMIS relay station will not only receive 
signals and transmit them in the conventional microwave manner 
to Earth, but will also ascertain whether the laser system will 
prove to be the preferred technique for reliable and rapid 
contacts and which frequencies are best. Finally, it is also 
conceivable that at some future point a laser optical system 
will also find use in distant missions. "We still do not know 
the practical limitations of this technology, but I'm convinced 
we will hear a lot more about it in the fullness of time," Dr. 
Fritz Merkle of Zeiss asserted. It is now quite clear that the 
laser system, by virtue of its lower power requirements, will 
permit the weight of communications equipment to be 
significantly reduced. This alone will open up completely new 
opportunities. 
  Closer at hand, of course, are the tests planned for late 
1995, when the Tenerife ground station is equipped with the 
Zeiss telescope. The instrument, as Mario Lopriore of the Estec 
space technology center pointed out to ESA, will most probably 
also be used to search for space junk. An accessory CCD camera, 
using the optical system of the telescope, reportedly will be 
able to detect remnant objects from older satellite or rocket 
engines from the centimeter range.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "First Airplane Telephone Communications </F>
Using the TFTS System"] 
  [Text] Paris--On 3 December, France Telecom sent its first 
telephone communication using the European system TFTS 
(Terrestrial Flight Telephone System) from a Paris-Athens flight 
on Air France, according to a statement from the telephone 
carrier. 
  The TFTS system makes it possible to establish telephone 
communications--or to send faxes and data--from a plane to any 
country by means of automatic dialing. The air-ground link is 
directly established through specialized equipment aboard the 
aircraft and a cellular network of stations on the ground, each 
with a range of 240 km linked to the stationary telephone 
network. 
  At the end of 1990, France Telecom joined with several 
European telephone carriers to create a TFTS network that would 
gradually cover all of Western Europe by 1994. The telephone 
carriers are also working with six European airlines (Air France 
for France) which will begin full-scale testing early next year 
aboard their planes.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The Information Technology Society in the Frankfurt 
League of German Electrical Engineers (ITG) regards digital 
mobile radio as a significant improvement in the position of 
Germany and Europe. They note that the Germans, in particular, 
not only played an essential role in the development of the new 
"Global System for Mobile Communication" (GSM) standard, but 
they were also in the vanguard in the development of the GSM 
mobile radio net. They also claim that a large percentage of 
Federal German territory is already equipped with radio stations 
for the D1 and D2 nets which use the GSM standard. By 1995, 95 
percent of the territory should be included. 
  GSM is the prerequisite for mobile telephoning without 
borders: 28 countries, including the CIS, China and Australia, 
want to install GSM radio nets over the next few years. When 
that has happened anyone within these countries who has a GSM 
mobile phone can access the net and place or receive a call. 
  The technical prerequisite for the compatibility of the 
individual national networks is the GSM standard set by ETSI 
(European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute). It 
defines the processing of the digital signals at the interface, 
the division of the frequency band into channels, modulation and 
coding as well as the functions of the fixed radio stations and 
their regulation. In Germany these technical requirements were 
met with the activation of the D1 net. ETSI standardization is 
converted into the national standard by the German Electronics 
Commission in the DIN and the VDE (DKE). 
  Software for the complex GSM systems runs on supercomputers 
which in turn must be incorporated into the net. The nets are 
constructed in such a way that in the signal area every radio 
station can reach a maximum number of subscribers simultaneously 
by mobile telephone. This is achieved by data reduction and by 
optimal utilization of the frequency bands by multiplex 
processing. The 137 frequencies in the 900-megaHertz band 
alloted to the GSM can each be utilized by eight subscribers. By 
multiple utilization of the frequencies at various points on the 
net an almost unlimited subscriber capacity is achieved. In the 
opinion of VDE-ITG, demands on mobile communications systems 
will continue to grow. Intelligent network functions will have 
to be developed for current nets in order to introduce a unified 
worldwide call number. Only then can the goal of "universal 
personal communication" be realized. Every subscriber should be 
able to access the network on any continent by card or telephone 
and be able to receive calls using the same call number in any 
country. By the year 2005 the European "Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System" should be using an integrated system 
to provide the services of mobile radio nets which today exist 
side by side. Comparable efforts are being undertaken worldwide 
with the objective of creating a "Future Public Land Mobile 
Telecommunication System."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Airbus: Air Inter to Buy the A319"] </F>
  [Text] AIR INTER has decided to order nine A319s from 
AIRBUS INDUSTRIE for delivery between July 1996 and mid-1997, 
plus nine options. The A319 is the short version of the A320 
and has many common features with the latter and with the 
stretch version A321, particularly systems and equipment. This 
makes for many maintenance and operational advantages and hence, 
economy. The cockpit of the A319 will be identical to that of 
the A320 and A321. Crews too will need one blanket type 
qualification to fly any of the three types. At present, AIR 
INTER flies 33 A320s. The airline has also ordered seven A321s 
for delivery starting this summer plus 15 wide-body A330s, the 
first of which was delivered on 30 December and entered service 
on 17 January on the Paris-Marseille and Paris-Toulouse 
connections. By February 1995, AIR INTER will receive four more 
A330s. The A330 also shares a strong family resemblance with 
the single-aisle versions made by AIRBUS INDUSTRIE. AIR INTER's 
A319s will be fitted out for 142 single class passengers. To 
date, AIRBUS INDUSTRIE has booked 802 orders for its 
single-aisle line (A319/A320/A321).

  [Text] Alcatel Espace Toulouse, a subsidiary of Alcatel 
announces the signing of an agreement with the Italian firm 
Alenia Spazio for development and building of a band Ka and S 
relay for the European Space Agency's experimental satellite 
Artemis. 
  The Artemis experimental satellite will be a precursor of 
future European DRS [Data Relay System] satellite-relays. It 
will be used to test and in-orbit qualify new payload 
technologies for transmitting low and high output data between 
ground stations in Europe and low orbit satellites. 
  As partner of the prime contractor, Alenia Spazio, Alcatel 
Espace will develop the direct relay that receives data coming 
from ground stations at 30 GHz [gigaherz] for S (2 GHz) and Ka 
band (23 GHz) to users such as the Spot 4 or the future European 
polar platforms Envisat and Metop. Alcatel Espace will also 
build part of the return relay which receives data from these 
same operators and retransmits same to the ground at 20 GHz. 
Under this contract, the Toulouse premises of Alcatel Espace 
will integrate equipment made by itself and by various European 
firms such as SIAR (Italy), ANT (Germany), COMDEV (United 
Kingdom) and, more particularly, by such Alcatel space-oriented 
firms as Alcatel Espacio (Spain) and Alcatel Bell (Belgium).

<F P=106> [Article signed by M. Hopmann from DASA [Deutsche Aerospace </F>
AG]: "Ariane-5 Upper Stage AESTUS Engine"] 
  [Text] Upper stage motors are not as powerful and 
impressive as those that propel the lower stages. However, due 
to their position closer to the payload, they have to offer 
extremely high efficiency and absolute minimum mass. 
  The AESTUS engine development started with a technological 
phase in 1986. The go-ahead for the main industrial development 
programme was given in 1989. The AESTUS engine is being 
developed by Deutsche Aerospace with support from more than 
eight industrial companies throughout Europe. 
  The AESTUS engine is the key propulsion element of the 
Ariane-5 upper stage, which provides thrust and impulse for 
payload insertion into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), low 
earth orbit (LEO), and sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). During the 
mission to GTO it burns nearly 10 tons of the storable 
propellant combination monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen 
tetroxide. 
  From the early technological and pre-development activities, 
the pressure-fed engine (formerly called "L5", then "L7") has 
grown in thrust, operating time and specific impulse. The 
latest version, now in its final development stage, produces a 
thrust of 28 kN [kilonewton] for a nominal duration of 1100 
seconds [s] and it operates with a vacuum specific impulse of 
3177 Ns/kg (324 s). The increase of thrust from 20 to 28 kN, 
achieved by an increase in dimensions, caused a severe 
combustion stability problem during development. Considerable 
efforts were spent to solve the problem and the engine has now 
successfully passed all stability tests. 
  All other development targets have been reached and the 
formal qualification of the engine is planned for early 1994. 
It has been proven that the design is mature and it has 
sufficient margin against critical loads or conditions. This 
was demonstrated by exploring a much wider test domain (in terms 
of mixture ratio and thrust), compared to the operational domain 
expected during flight. 
  The engine is therefore considered to be a highly reliable 
workhorse for Ariane-5, offering also growth capabilities for 
future versions of the launcher. 
  Since reliability was one of the most important design 
drivers, well-proven design concepts were used. The only 
notable exception was the injector, where a novel coaxial 
multi-element design was introduced with the aim of achieving 
high combustion efficiency, combustion stability, and adequate 
thermal conditions for the injector face plate and the 
combustion chamber inner wall. The photograph shows the layout 
of the engine that consists of the following components: 
  -- cross-type universal joint 
  -- multi-element coaxial injector 
  -- regeneratively-cooled combustion chamber 
  -- radiation-cooled nozzle extension 
  -- oxidizer and fuel valve assembly 
  -- gimballing actuator struts. 
  The newly developed injector comprises 132 coaxial injection 
elements. The fuel enters the injector coming from the cooling 
channels of the chamber. It cools the face plate before feeding 
each injector and being injected into the chamber. The oxidiser 
is distributed to the injection elements via a manifold located 
on the rear of the injector base-plate. 
  The combustion chamber is an integral design, the same as 
that developed and used by Deutsche Aerospace for the cryogenic 
engines HM7 and HM60 Vulcain. It consists of a stainless steel 
inner liner with milled cooling passages and an electrolytically 
deposited nickel layer for outer closure. The 
regeneratively-cooled nozzle part extends to an area ratio of 
10:1. At the interface to the injector, the combustion chamber 
is fitted with quarter wave acoustic absorbers. The absorbers 
are not required for normal engine operation and not even during 
helium-gas ingestion testing, but bomb testing revealed too 
small a margin against bomb-triggered combustion instabilities. 
This margin could be markedly improved by the introduction of 
these absorbers, tuned to the first and second tangential modes 
of the chamber. Following are the main design and operation 
data of the motor: 
  -- Length: 2195 mm 
  -- Nozzle exit diameter: 1263 mm 
  -- Mass: 111 kg 
  -- Thrust (N): 27,870 
  -- Mass flow: 8.772 kg/s 
  -- Mixture ratio O/F: 2.05 
  -- Chamber pressure: 10.28 bar 
  -- Propellant feed pressure: 17.8 bar 
  -- Nozzle area ratio (aerodyn.): 83.3 
  -- Vacuum specific impulse: 3176.8 Ns/kg 
  -- Characteristic velocity: 1684.7 m/s

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "AEROSPATIALE: Report for 1993"] </F>
  [Text] During his meeting with members of the press on 5 
January 1994, Louis Gallois, Chairman-Chief Executive of 
AEROSPATIALE commented on the activities of the firm during 
1993, a year of depressed markets. He expressed the opinion 
that the market would not improve suddenly as if by magic. 
Figures relating to the second half of 1993 show that while a 
nadir has been reached, there were a few bright spots during the 
year: 
  1) AEROSPATIALE not only consolidated, but in some cases 
improved its market position in spite of the difficult period. 
  a) Civil market was particularly down in 1993: 
  -- In the case of aircraft with more than 100 seats, 
cancellations and new orders balanced each other out. The three 
major constructors thus consider 1993 to be a year of status quo; 
  -- Demand for commuter aircraft was more vigorous during the 
2d half of the year and the ATR [Regional Transport Aircraft] 
significantly strengthened its position; 
  -- The civilian helicopter market was also in deep 
depression, although EUROCOPTER increased its share to more than 
50 percent of the world market; 
  -- Space products, the Ariane and satellites proved that 
they 
could successfully compete, notably, with American products. 
Key events during the year 1993 were seven faultless Ariane 4 
launchings, anticipatory launcher procurement by ARIANESPACE and 
the starting up of a new satellite platform, Spacebus 3000 with 
the Arabsat II. 
  b) In the field of military helicopters and missiles: In 
spite of a continuing slump in the market, there was a definite 
improvement in export orders which indicated the ability of the 
company to remain competitive. The French Defense budget for 
1994 is better than might have been feared with a market poor in 
promise for military expenditures. 
  During 1993 orders for civil aircraft and helicopters 
retracted to around 29 billion francs [Fr] against nearly 40 in 
1992, in spite of an improvement in military and space export 
contracts. At the end of the year, order books stood at Fr130 
billion, representing two and a half years of activity. The 
1993 revenue of the AEROSPATIALE group was around Fr49.3 
billion, a retraction of only 5 percent compared to 1992. 
  2) Trim-down Steps Already Show Significant Results in 1993. 
  While net profits were still in deficit phase in 1993, there 
was a significant improvement. This improvement, vital for 
AEROSPATIALE, was not obtained, as we have seen, through any 
recovery in the general situation, worse in 1993 than in 1992, 
but through rigorous restructuring efforts by the company and a 
remarkable willingness of personnel to accept them. These 
efforts will continue through 1994. At the time, andebtedness 
stabilized and even diminished. Now the aim is to return to a 
balanced situation as soon as possible, and, in any event, no 
later than 1995.

European Astronauts on Board Mir] 
  [Text] Two space missions involving ESA astronauts are 
planned for 1994 and 1995. As they will take place on board the 
Russian station MIR, they have been dubbed the "EUROMIR 
missions". 
  Since August 1993, four astronauts have been training at 
Star 
City near Moscow in preparation for the missions: The first one 
will last 30 days and the other 135 days. Training has been 
particularly intensive because time is short. The astronauts 
working on EUROMIR 94 (30 days in orbit) and Ulf Merbold from 
Germany, and Pedro Duque from Spain. The Swedish astronaut, 
Christer Fuglesang, and the German, Thomas Reiter, are working 
on EUROMIR 95 (135 days in orbit). For each EUROMIR mission, 
one ESA astronaut will fly and the other will be the back-up. 
All four European astronauts recently completed their basic 
training and embarked on the second phase after the Christmas 
holiday period, which was a welcome break from the schedule of 
intensive activities on which they have been working with the 
Russians. During the break, on 17 December, Thomas Reiter, 
Christer Fuglesang and Pedro Duque, together with the Frenchman 
Jean-Francois Clervoy and the Italian Maurizio Cheli -- who have 
both been training as mission specialists for a flight on board 
a US Shuttle -- received their official European astronaut 
certificates at a ceremony held at the European Astronaut Centre 
(EAC), Cologne, Germany, to the great pleasure of Ulf Merbold, a 
spaceflight veteran who has been on tow missions aboard the 
Shuttle. 
  This has also been an appropriate time to take a closer look 
at these missions for which the go-ahead decision was taken at 
1992 Granada meeting of ministers responsible for space. Until 
then, the Member States of ESA had cooperated with the Russians 
on manned flights on an individual basis only. However, once 
the Russians had declared an interest in cooperation on a wider, 
more European basis, the European space ministers meeting gave 
ESA a remit to negotiate new areas of cooperation. 
<H5>  The Transitional Period </H5>
  Russia has built up a formidable space capability; increased 
international cooperations is a way of sustaining a using this 
capability more efficiently, to the benefit of all mankind. 
  But international cooperation on large programmes such as 
manned spaceflight is also a must for Europe, the United States 
and other space-faring nations, not only in terms of 
cost-sharing but also because cooperation pools technical as 
well as human resources. Generally speaking, the world today has 
nothing in common with the world as it was five years ago. 
Manned missions are now seen in a different light. Where there 
was competition, there is now international cooperation. What 
is taking place is in fact a merger of the Russian MIR station 
with the international space station concept, thus making it 
"global". Distinctions are no longer drawn between the West's 
Freedom station and the successor of the Russian MIR-1 station. 
  "We are moving into the age of manned flights on a worldwide 
scale", explains Jean-Jacques Dordain, Associate Director for 
Strategy, Planning and International Policy at ESA. "Europe 
intends to be a full partner in this development and this means 
that the plans drawn up in 1987 need to be adjusted to take into 
account the new situation that we have now." 
<H5>  The Deadline </H5>
  Since the MIR station was not planned to be operational 
beyond 1995/6, Europe could not wait for years before putting 
its astronauts into space. That is why this deadline prompted 
it to rapidly conduct negotiations with the Russians. The 
problem confronting ESA is the relatively short period available 
for preparation of the experiment programme and for training. 
The Russians assured that one year was sufficient training for 
a one-month mission such as EUROMIR 94. However, this assumed 
that the astronauts were of high calibre! The Russians have 
confirmed that the two candidates chosen for this flight fully 
meet the requirements for the type of mission involved. 
  "We have a little more time for EUROMIR 95", says 
Jean-Jacques Dordain, "even though this will be the first time a 
non-Russian will spend 135 days in space! This mission requires 
longer, more complex training but the Russians, who undoubtedly 
have more experience that us in this respect, have assured us 
that this is feasible." 
  One the political decision had been taken, a coherent 
science 
programme had to be drawn up rapidly. ESA took up the challenge. 
  Heinz Oser, the senior life scientist in the ESA 
microgravity 
programme says: "For the first flight we have chosen three main 
experiment themes in life sciences. The first will concentrate 
on studying changes in the cardiovascular system when an 
astronaut leaves Earth to go into space, and monitoring his or 
her readjustments to gravity on returning to our plant. The 
second theme concerns studies of the human neuro-sensory system 
to gain a better understanding of how certain internal 
mechanisms react when a human being is subject to near 
weightlessness. The third theme concerns the muscle system 
which will be measured before and after the one-month long 
flight in terms of muscle-strength and mass. It is believed 
that under weightlessness conditions, muscle-weakening 
mechanisms are different from those on Earth. ESA has also 
selected five materials science experiments, which will require 
the use of a furnace on MIR developed by the Czechs, and two 
technology experiments." 
  For the choice of experiments to be performed on MIR for the 
1994 mission, a factor to be taken into account was also the 
restriction on the weight of the payload to be brought back by 
the Soyuz capsule, which must not exceed about ten kilos. This 
limitation has obliged ESA to give preference to certain 
experiments and even cut down on others -- for instance, there 
will be fewer urine samples than scientists originally planned! 
  "Returning time-critical experiment products to Earth is one 
of the major problems of these missions" explains Wolfgang 
Nellessen, ESA EUROMIR Project Manager. "On Soyuz, there is 
only limited capacity for bringing back specimens and samples in 
addition to the cosmonauts. This means we have to decide which 
products should be brought back as a priority and, in the event, 
the biological blood, urine and saliva samples will return to 
Earth with the European astronaut on Soyuz. The materials 
science samples may have to stay on MIR until one of the 
US-Russian missions, when a Shuttle will dock with the station 
and could bring them back." 
  The Shuttle will visit MIR up to ten times over the period 
1995 to 1997, foreshadowing the development of a global station. 
Since EUROMIR 95 is to take place during the period in which US 
Shuttles will fly to MIR, it may be possible to use the Shuttle 
flights to carry equipment to MIR and return to Earth samples 
from some experiments carried out during the EUROMIR 95 mission. 
The Shuttle could therefore be used to considerably enhance the 
EUROMIR 95 operations. 
<H5>  135 Days in Orbit </H5>
  The most distinctive feature of the EUROMIR missions is the 
exceptionally long period that will be spent in space. This 
will be the first time European astronauts will be in orbit for 
so long -- 30 days for the first mission and 135 days for the 
second. 
  Heinz Oser: "This period, which will be far longer than 
those spent with the Americans on the Shuttle (8 to 14 days), 
will enable us to gather much more data. For the first flight, 
lasting 30 days, we have sought to make maximum use of the 
equipment already on board MIR. However, for the second 
mission, planned to last 135 days, there is more time to develop 
new hardware involving European firms. Experiments envisaged are 
a biokit, which will enable us to expose biological samples to 
microgravity and cosmic radiation, and an instrument able to 
measure changes in an astronaut's bone density as bones tend to 
become brittle during long-duration missions because of 
demineralisation." 
  Several research institutes, most of them attached to 
European universities, will be taking part in the experiments on 
the EUROMIR missions. 
  Heinz Oser: "With these experiments, European life 
scientists will be able to refine their analyses and statistics 
on how human beings react when they leave the Earth's gravity 
behind them to live under microgravity conditions in space and 
then return to Earth after periods of varying duration. The 
more people studied, the more reliable the results will be. In 
making preparations for the first mission, we have of course not 
been able to select all the experiments originally proposed by 
scientists." 
<H5>  Precursor Flights </H5>
  An astronaut frequently has a heavy workload given that it 
takes much longer to carry out an experiment in space than on 
Earth! 
  "During each EUROMIR mission, the ESA astronaut will work a 
daily shift of a maximum of twelve hours of which up to six 
hours are dedicated to scientific work", says Wolfgang 
Nellessen. "Saturdays and Sundays are rest days. By fixing the 
weekly work period for experiments at about 25 hours, and given 
that the European astronaut will work for four weeks on the 
EUROMIR 94 mission, a hundred or so hours will be spent carrying 
out the mission's scientific programme." 
  Around a hundred hours of scientific experimentation for the 
European astronaut on EUROMIR 94 and, by extension, about 450 
hours for EUROMIR 95, lasting 135 days, will be allocated. In 
addition, the Russian cosmonauts will provide support for the 
ESA programme of experiments. 
  In the words of Mr. F. Engstrom, ESA's Space Station and 
Microgravity Director: "These EUROMIR flights are considered as 
precursors of European participation (through the Columbus 
programme) in the global space station. Using such a station in 
space obviously means long-duration missions will be necessary 
so, clearly, you cannot change astronauts every week! At 
present, it is planned to change crews on a permanently manned 
space station every three to six months. With the two EUROMIR 
missions, Europe is therefore preparing its astronauts for the 
forthcoming global space station era. Furthermore, this is an 
excellent opportunity to perform scientific experiments as well 
as prepare the user community for that era."

<F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Kerlouegan: "ATR In Good Health"] </F>
  [Text] Toulouse -- While most aircraft manufacturers are 
still rather gloomy, the French-Italian Economic Interest 
Grouping [GIE] ATR is looking remarkably satisfied. According 
to Managing Director Henri-Paul Puel, 1993 "was a good year." 
  With 61 firm orders recorded last year, against 20 for the 
previous year, ATR has performed even better than in 1990, which 
had been the best year for orders since the group's creation in 
1981. "Our group alone sold more aircraft last year than all our 
competitors put together," stated Henri-Paul Puel. The total 
including options comes to 138, against 135 in 1990. 27 orders 
were cancelled, 21 of which by the Irish leasing company GPA. 
  The consortium welcomed 14 new purchasers last year, 
bringing 
its number of customers to 60. To date 42 percent of the 
aircraft produced have been sold to Europe, 38 percent to North 
America, but only 10 percent in Asia, 6 percent in Africa and 
the Middle-East, and 4 percent in South America. Since its 
creation, the group has taken 53 percent of the world regional 
transport plane market in the 40 to 70-seat turboprop category. 
  Revenues for 1993, which depend solely on deliveries, 
totaled 
3.7 billion French francs [Fr], the same as in 1992. The net 
result, however, should be "well up" with a gain in the order of 
Fr50 million. For the third year running, ATR should see a 
profit. According to Henri-Paul Puel, the balance sheet for 1994 
should be similar to that for 1993, i.e. around 50 deliveries 
with some 60 firm orders. 
<H5>  ATR 82 </H5>
  This year, or by the start of 1995 at the latest, the group 
should announce the launch of a new aircraft which will be the 
third in the ATR family. In the wake of the ATR 42 and the ATR 
72 that can carry 48 and 66 passengers respectively, the 
consortium proposes building the 80-seater ATR 82. Henri-Paul 
Puel still considers the launch cost, today estimated at Fr3 
billion, to be too high and he wants to lower it to Fr2.4 
billion. 
  Although it does not appear to be essential, it is very 
probable that a third industrial partner might enter the group 
at this time to join forces with Aerospatiale and Aeritalia, 
which have stood alone for 13 years. The question is who will 
it be, and will they have to be European. According to 
Henri-Paul Puel, "anything is possible," although he adds that 
at the current time, as the saying goes, "everybody is talking 
to everybody else." 
  Lastly, the group's limited foothold in Asia could soon be 
improved if there is a successful conclusion to negotiations 
being held with China. However, everyone knows that the Chinese 
are in no hurry, and Henri-Paul Puel is still very cautious when 
he mentions the conclusion of the current negotiations for the 
sale of ATR 72's to three airlines and the creation of an 
assembly line at Xian, with the possibility of a license being 
granted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Imagery from NRSC"] </F>
  [Text] The UK's National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) Ltd 
has signed an agreement with Jebco Information Services Ltd of 
London to sell Russian high resolution digital satellite 
imagery. The NRSC has access to over 2 million photographic 
images acquired over the last 19 years. 
  Panchromatic and multispectral images acquired by Resource 
satellites offer a best ground resolution of five metres which 
is sufficient to define streets and buildings, says the NRSC. 
This is said to be ideal for the generation of image maps for 
use by cartographers, geologists and urban planners. An oil 
company recently ordered imagery of the pre-Caspian Basin in 
Kazakhstan to identify oil wells and roads. 
  The NRSC distribution stems from the formation of WorldMap, 
a 
consortium comprising Jebco, Priroda (Russia's leading civilian 
remote sensing organisation) and Rosvneshgeo (a Russian company 
associated with geology and mineral exploration). WorldMap is 
addressing the problems of exploiting Russian satellite imagery, 
difficulties such as data conversion, cataloguing, prompt 
delivery, quality, and payment. 
  Resource photographic films are archived by Priroda and 
WorldMap has embarked on a massive digital conversion project. 
About 500 scenes a month are being put on 8 mm Exabyte tape. 
Two Vexcel VX3000 scanners are linked to Sun Microsystems SPARC 
workstation. The scanners are capable of pixel spacing down to 
8.5 microns. 
  All tapes are archived in London. A catalogue allows data 
search. Delivery from London takes a matter of days, whilst 
delivery of images not yet available from London usually only 
takes 10 days. Previously, payment had to be made in advance 
and delivery often took months. 
  Priroda operates two satellite types, Resource F-1 and F-2. 
Three or four flights per year are made, each lasting about 30 
days, with a maximum of 17 days of photography. Vertical 
incidence imagery is available at latitudes up to 82.3o and 
specific areas can be overflown on request.

<F P=106> [Article signed Jean-Paul Croize: "Ariane: The </F>
Consequences of a Chance Mishap"] 
  [Text] Two "shop-window" satellites of French technology, 
with a global value in the region of 2 billion French francs 
[Fr], fell into the Atlantic Ocean together with the rocket that 
was carrying them. A developing country, Turkey, and an 
international organization, Eutelsat, lost precious 
communication tools. Several weeks at least will be needed for 
the technical inquiry, bringing Ariane's commercial ambitions to 
a temporary halt. These are the weighty consequences of the 
failure of the 63rd rocket launch six minutes after lift-off 
from the Kourou space center in French Guyana. 
  However, this should not cast doubts on the credibility of 
the European rocket. This was only the sixth accident to occur 
since launches commenced in December 1979. 
  It already appears that this failure was due to a 
malfunctioning component in the engine of the third stage used 
on this version. According to the announcement made yesterday 
afternoon by Charles Bigot, managing director of the rocket's 
production company, Arianespace, the faulty component was a 
roller bearing in the turbopump supplying the engine with 
oxygen. "We view this problem seriously but also calmly, 
because we know that our rockets are reliable" he said, before 
quoting from a letter from French Industry Minister Gerard 
Longuet assuring him of the "confidence" of the French 
government. 
  A commission of inquiry will submit a report explaining in 
full the circumstances of the incident, before the next rocket 
launch which could be delayed only a few weeks. 
  Yet, everything had started very well on Monday evening for 
this 63rd rocket flight, which took off as planned at 2137 GMT 
with its payload of "Turksat 1", Turkey's first 
telecommunications satellite, and "Eutelsat II F5" belonging to 
the European organization of the same name. Everything went 
according to plan with the first and second stage separations, 
and the ignition of the third stage engine on this "Ariane 44 
LP" rocket was greeted with the usual sigh of relief on the 
ground at the Kourou space center. 
<H5>  Sensitive Point </H5>
  Some 80 seconds later the flight controllers noted an 
abnormal pressure drop in the third stage engine's combustion 
chamber which was suddenly extinguished. 
From that point on, the rocket and its two satellites were 
irredeemably lost. Even at an altitude of 200 km Ariane had not 
built up a speed sufficient to push it into orbit, and its radar 
trace, represented by a dot on the control screens, plummeted 
towards the middle of the Atlantic before crashing a few minutes 
later. 
  By the end of the evening, in French Guyana the first 
analyses of the measurements taken between third stage ignition 
and its premature shutdown had revealed an abnormal heating-up 
of one of the roller bearings in the third stage engine's 
turbopump, a kind of "carburetor" used to inject the mixture of 
liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to make it work. Some 60 
seconds after lift-off, the bearing of the shaft supplying the 
engine with oxygen gradually started to heat up before its 
temperature rose suddenly at the 80-second mark, which was 
probably when the bearing jammed, blocking the turbopump and 
causing the engine to stall because it was no longer being 
supplied with fuel. 
  This extremely sophisticated engine has been responsible for 
four of the six Ariane failures. However, it would appear that 
this failure will not lead to a rethink of the engine's design: 
"We fully master its technology, even if it is one of Ariane's 
more sensitive points. I consider its design to be the 
state-of-the- art," Charles Bigot forcefully underlined. He 
also remarked that there had not been a third-stage failure 
since 1986, some 44 flights previously. While he admitted that 
Arianespace would not run the risk of launching another version 
of the rocket before the commission of inquiry had reported back 
with its conclusions, he believed that an initial report could 
be available by the middle of February. The possibility of 
flights beginning again within a few weeks cannot therefore be 
ruled out. 
  Given that there have been 26 successful flights since the 
last accident in 1990, and the fact that these two satellites 
were particularly well-insured -- according to Kourou the launch 
had been covered for $350 million -- Monday evening's failure 
seems to have been received calmly. Engineers were talking of a 
chance mishap, difficult to take but at the end of the day quite 
"acceptable" for a launcher that originally was designed with an 
MFR of 10 flights to keep production costs down. The 
Arianespace managing director even stated: "It should be 
possible to gradually claw back the delay caused by this problem 
to achieve our aim of 30 launches over the next three years." 
  With some 70 percent of the world market in civilian 
satellite launches, Ariane still has, after the loss of these 
two satellites, a total of 35 firm orders for putting satellites 
into orbit between now and 1997. Arianespace stated yesterday 
that the coming weeks should see no cancellations cutting into 
this winning formula, which generates revenues of more than Fr17 
billion.

<F P=106> [Article signed Jean-Paul Croize: "An Ill-Fated Third </F>
Stage"] 
  [Text] For the engineers there is no question of rethinking 
the technical concepts on which the European launcher is based. 
They claim: "It is a one-off problem relating to a part 
failure or a machining accident for one of the components in the 
third stage." 
  Nevertheless, Ariane's third stage, based on the use of a 
cryotechnical engine that is extremely difficult to master since 
it is fueled by a mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen at minus 
251 degrees Celsius and minus 184 degrees Celsius respectively, 
is really the "ill-fated" part of the launcher, since it has led 
to four of the six failed flights. 
  The initial technical data once again clearly points the 
finger at this third stage, and more specifically its engine. 
After several operations engineers spoke at Kourou of a "loss 
of pressure" when the failure occurred, the theory was 
postulated of a failed roller bearing in the engine's turbopump. 
It seems that initial flight data analyses soon showed the 
bearing to be heating up. This would have led to it blocking 
and prematurely stopping the turbopump injecting hydrogen and 
oxygen into the combustion chamber. 
  Weighing some 30 kg, this turbopump is without doubt the 
most 
fragile Ariane component. It delivers 400 kilowatts of power, 
the same as a high speed train, and rotates at 63,000 rpm. 
Throughout its 600 seconds of operation in normal flight it has 
to undergo extreme stress, and is less than 50 cm from 
temperatures of minus 251 degrees Celsius at the hydrogen 
injection point and plus 1,500 degrees Celsius in the combustion 
chamber. 
  Without re-examining the design of the engine itself, it is 
clear that even the slightest machining error or flaw in the 
alloys can have devastating consequences.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Karnevi and E. Dean: "Envisat's Advanced </F>
Synthetic Aperture Radar: ASAR"] 
  [Text] An advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) has 
been selected as the imaging radar sensor for the Envisat-1 
payload. In addition to providing continuity of data with the 
single-swath, single-polarisation Active Microwave 
Instrumentation (AMI) currently flying on ERS-1 (and ERS-2), the 
ASAR has the additional advantages of offering: greater 
coverage, with more flexibility in the choice of swath 
positions, a wider range of incidence angles, and a wide swath 
capability; dual polarisation; and improved wave mode 
capabilities. 
<H5>  ASAR'S Role </H5>
  The objectives for the Advanced SAR are very similar to 
those 
of the AMI on ERS-1 and ERS-2. The main task will again be that 
of monitoring the Earth's environment to collect more precise 
information on global change, focussing specifically on global 
climate and all of the factors that may influence it. 
  Monitoring of the Earth's bio-mass, especially the 
deforestation in the large primeval forests in the equatorial 
regions, will allow better modelling of the influence on the 
greenhouse effect and global climate and facilitate the 
implementation of countermeasures. 
  Desertification and the distribution of humidity, changes in 
water levels, flooded areas, and the extent of the ice caps 
around the North and South Poles are other major factors that 
need to be monitored in order to improve our understanding of 
global climate change. 
  Envisat's SAR images will also further improve our 
understanding of ocean dynamics, the interactions between oceans 
and atmosphere, as well as both manmade and natural processes in 
coastal zones. 
  The major advantage of using a SAR for earth-observation 
tasks lies in its ability to acquire imagery day or night and 
independent of cloud cover and weather conditions. This 
weather-independent capability is of vital importance for 
disaster assessment, as major floods or large oil spills, 
usually occur in weather conditions that drastically curtail the 
usefulness of optical sensors. 
  ERS-1 SAR images have also proved extremely useful for 
shipping operations in Arctic ice. Ocean-wave spectra taken 
around the globe with ASAR will further improve the safety of 
shipping routes and offshore activities. 
  As experience with SAR data grows, its contribution to 
resource management will also become more and more important. 
In addition to the bio-mass estimating application already 
mentioned, improved classification methods will allow more 
accurate harvest predictions, better estimates of sweet-water 
resources and, via geological surveys, support the search for 
mineral resources. 
<H5>  The ASAR Instrument </H5>
  Given the rapid expansion in the SAR data user community, it 
is essential that Envisat should carry an instrument that not 
only provides data continuity with ERS-1 and ERS-2, but also at 
the same time represents a step forward in terms of both system 
flexibility and the scientific and operational value of its data 
sets. 
  To satisfy these needs, the ASAR design incorporates: 
  -- A flexible swath-position capability, which will offer 
the 
choice between several image swath positions at various 
distances from the subsatellite track with different incidence 
angles. 
  -- A dual-polarisation facility (cf. vertical only on ERS), 
offering horizontal or vertical polarisation imaging. 
  The ASAR's ability to switch between different swaths offers 
very fast multiplexing, so that an overall swath more than 400 
km wide can be imaged in one pass. In addition to this 
so-called "Wide Swath Mode", the ASAR can be set to operate at a 
coarse spatial resolution of only 1000 m. The data rate will 
then be low enough for tape recording onboard the spacecraft. 
This is known as the "Global Monitoring Mode" and it 
constitutes a tool for monitoring such features as ice coverage, 
snow coverage, deforestation, desertification or humidity, 
without interruption and on a global scale, due to its 
independence from ground-station coverage. 
  The ASAR's ability to switch between two polarisation allows 
a special "Alternating Polarisation Mode" to be implemented 
which permits half of the looks at a scene to be acquired with a 
horizontal, and the other half with a vertical polarisation in a 
single pass, thereby considerably increasing the target 
classification capability (especially if used in conjunction 
with multi-temporal imaging of the same scene). 
  Furthermore ASAR will, like ERS, have a "Wave Mode" for 
taking 5 x 5 km images but more frequently, over 100 or 200 km 
distances, and with two such images in any swath over the 
oceans, to supply ocean-wave spectra on a global basis. 
  The ASAR instrument is divided functionally into two 
sub-assemblies: 
  -- An Antenna Sub-Assembly (ASA), containing the 
phased-array 
antenna electronics distributed over 20 "tiles", and 
  -- A Central Electronics Sub-Assembly (CESA), providing 
signal (RF) generation and reception, control signals, power 
conditioning and data formatting. 
  The ASAR antenna consists of five hinged panels, each 
containing four tiles. 
  The CESA equipment units are mounted on three of the Payload 
Equipment Bay panels inside the spacecraft. 
  Control of the instrument covers the following functions: 
  -- Selecting the required mode and generating the 
appropriate 
timeline. 
  -- Selecting the required antenna beam pattern for the 
required swath (or beam patterns in modes where multiple swaths 
are needed). 
  -- Housekeeping, including setting redundancy paths. 
  -- Monitoring the status of all equipment. 
  -- Patching and dumping any software. 
  Control is maintained by sending macro-commands via the 
onboard computer to the Instrument Control Unit (ICU). 
<H5>  Instrument Performance </H5>
  The ASAR instrument has several operating modes, which can 
be 
grouped into four areas: 
  -- Support modes 
  -- Operational modes 
  -- Calibration modes 
  -- Test/health-check modes. 
  The various roles are summarised in Table 1.

Test                                     On-ground testing facility 


  The operational modes can themselves be divided into three 
different categories: 
  -- High-spatial-resolution imaging modes 
  -- Low-spatial-resolution imaging modes 
  -- Wave mode. 
<H5>  High-spatial-resolution Imaging Modes </H5>
  In these two modes - the so-called "Image Mode" and 
"Alternating Polarisation Mode" - the ASAR operates as an 
imaging radar with high spatial resolution (typically a few tens 
of metres), and relatively narrow swaths (up to 120 km). 
  The Image Mode provides continuous coverage over a single 
swath nominally 100 km wide. The swath can be selected anywhere 
within a 500 km region (incidence angle range 15-45 degrees). 
For nominal operation, seven swaths (IS1 to IS7) are defined 
over this region. The imaging is performed by transmitting a 
continuous series of pulses and acquiring the required echo 
information after the appropriate return trip delay. 
  The transition to Image Mode is made automatically following 
the appropriate macro-command. Before the actual measurement of 
data is initiated, a period of stabilisation, noise measurement 
and internal calibration is performed. Echo measurement then 
starts, during which the initial calibration is updated on a 
regular basis. Image Mode operation continues uninterrupted 
until the receipt of another macro-command to switch to another 
mode. 
  The Alternating Polarisation Mode provides vertically and 
horizontally polarised imaging of the same scene by interleaving 
looks with each polarisation along track within the synthetic 
aperture. The echo measurement is made within repetition cycles 
containing two bursts of transmissions on each of the 
polarisations. The sequence is only interrupted when the 
internal calibration requires updating (as for the Image Mode). 
<H5>  Low-Spatial-Resolution Imaging Modes </H5>
  These are the "Wide Swath Mode" and "Global Monitoring 
Mode", 
in which the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with low spatial 
resolution (100 m to 1 km) and relatively wide swath (more than 
400 km). To obtain global coverage for the Global Monitoring 
Mode, the data is stored onboard the satellite and transferred 
to ground when it passes over a ground station. 
  The Wide Swath Mode provides continuous coverage over a 
swath 
nominally 400 km wide, which is divided into five subswaths 
ranging from 60 to 100 km in width. The ASAR transmits bursts 
of pulses to each of the subswaths in turn in such a way that a 
continuous along-track image is built up for each subswath. 
  During a transition to Wide Swath Mode, all the necessary 
data transfers and timing parameters are established. 
Stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration 
follow in a similar manner to the Image Mode, after which the 
echo measurement sequence itself commences. For each subswath, 
there is a burst of transmissions followed by a short quiescent 
period whilst the echoes from the last transmit pulses are 
received. Transmissions then switch to the next subswath in the 
cycle. The updating of the internal calibration is performed at 
the end of each subswath transmission burst. 
  The Global Monitoring Mode provides continuous along-track 
sampling across a 400 km swath, again using a SAR scanning 
technique. This mode has a low data rate due to a slightly 
reduced along-track duty ratio and the use of digital filtering 
for reduction in the across-track direction. The same subswaths 
as defined for the Wide Swath Mode are used. 
<H5>  Wave Mode </H5>
  In the "Wave Mode", the ASAR uses the facilities of the 
Image 
Mode to image small areas of the ocean surface, measuring the 
changes in radar backscatter from the surface due to wave 
action. The imaging is carried out to a high spatial resolution 
over one or two areas across a swath of approximately 5 km x 5 
km at intervals of nominally 100 or 200 km in the along-track 
direction. 
  The transition to Wave Mode is identical to that for the 
Image Mode, including the initial calibration sequence. This is 
followed by a burst of transmissions covering the 5 km 
along-track vignette distance. A quiescent period is then used 
to transfer the data to the Payload Data Handling and 
Transmission System via the low-rate data interface. The total 
duration of the repetition cycle is the time taken to traverse 
the 100 or 200 km separation between vignettes. Noise and 
calibration sequences are repeated at the start of each cycle. 
  The predicted in-orbit performances of the ASAR instrument 
in 
its various modes of operation are presented in Table 2. The 
instrument is still in the development stage and its final 
performance parameters will be established as part of the 
Preliminary Design Review, scheduled for early 1994.

<H5>  Product Processing </H5>
  The images acquired by ASAR will be processed on the ground 
and distributed mainly from ESRIN in Frascati(I). The products 
will fall into four main categories: 
  -- High-Resolution Images, generated within 24 h of sensing 
and normally distributed by non-electronic means, similar to the 
ERS-1 Precision Image (PRI). 
  -- Fast-Delivery Products, delivered within 3 h of sensing 
via electronic links; this product will have a lower geometric 
resolution (approx. 100 m pixels). 
  -- Browse Products, delivered within 3 h, but with very low 
resolution, and used for Browse Catalogues. 
  -- Wave Imagettes and Spectra, similar to the ERS-1 wave 
spectra, but with the ASAR enhancements. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In addition to achieving comparable performance to ERS-1 in 
the swath that coincides with the ERS-1 single fixed swath, the 
ASAR instrument will give Envisat-1: 
  -- Wider swath and incidence-angle coverage 
  -- A second channel of information by means of the dual- 
polarisation capability 
  -- Variable spatial resolutions and data rates. 
  In addition, the ASAR can be tuned during its in-orbit 
lifetime to make optimum use of the power available. Satellite 
instrument designs are generally driven by end-of-life 
requirements, which often results in under-utilisation early in 
a mission. The ASAR's built-in flexibility will allow it to 
take advantage of beginning-of-life conditions. It will also 
enable operating modes other than the baseline modes that were 
identified in Table 1 to be explored during the Envisat-1 
mission, thereby helping to define requirements and modes of 
operation for future SAR missions.

<F P=106> [Article by Waldemar Schafer and Josef Hess under the </F>
rubric "Companies and Markets": "DARA [German Agency for Space 
Affairs]/Conversation With the New Director General, Jan-Baldem 
Mennicken. Adapt Strategy to Changed Conditions. Stronger 
Involvement of Small and Medium-Sized Companies. German 
Astronautics Must Not Jeopardize Its Great Potential"] 
  [Text] Thursday, 11 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--"As long as our 
competitors are being government-supported in a world of 
international competition, this has to be possible in Germany 
too. As with all high technologies, with space too the 
government has to not only set the general framework, but also 
provide positive support for further development." The new 
director general of DARA (German Agency for Space Affairs), 
Jan-Baldem Mennicken, made this statement in a conversation with 
HANDELSBLATT. 
  In Mennicken's opinion, German astronautics is contributing 
to the solution of terrestrial problems. This refers first and 
foremost to problems of telecommunications, earth observation, 
navigation and detection and ranging. It is making use of fixed 
positions beyond the earth. 
  Besides direct practical application, DARA is interested 
also 
in the (indirect) economic effect of space projects, in 
improvement of the industrial structure. It is precisely small 
and medium-sized companies too that must be included in the 
programs here: On the one hand, large companies must let 
themselves be supplied by small and medium-sized ones. 
Mennicken: "We want to bring about transparency in the market as 
regards national funds and those of the European Space Agency 
(ESA) as well. We are trying to get the large system companies 
to deliberately award a part of their contracts to small and 
medium-sized companies." On the other hand, DARA is trying to 
make small and medium-sized companies fit for such industrial 
cooperation, including for development, as regards reliability 
and quality standards, for example. DARA has worked out a 
strategic plan for this purpose. 
  There have definitely been successes in the endeavor of the 
"commercialization" of German astronautics--meaning economic 
activities independently of government support. According to the 
German industry's data, space's share in 1992 already reached a 
volume of business of 430 million German marks [DM], primarily 
in the area of telecommunications and through contracts 
associated with the production of ESA's Ariane-4 rocket. DM1.248 
billion of government support funds were received in the same 
time period, it is stated. The one-to-three ratio between both 
sources of income is viewed as relatively satisfactory. 
<H3>  Research Funds Not Only from BMFT [Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology] </H3>
  Ever since its founding DARA has endeavored to interest in 
space projects other departments too, besides the Federal 
Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) as the main 
financier of German aerospace. There have already been successes 
here too. For instance, a decision has been made at the Federal 
Ministry of Transport to appropriate funds for the second 
generation of Meteosat weather observation satellites that will 
be operational around the year 2000. The time lead versus purely 
terrestrial weather observation already today amounts to two 
days. Cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture is desired in 
a special application for monitoring the use of agricultural 
areas. The observation of seismic areas is very valuable to the 
insurance business, for example. The German Rosat x-ray 
satellite has provided spectacular results in 
space-station-based astronomy. It is essential for full 
utilization of the potential for the exploitation of space to 
develop certain additional instruments or to find a new use for 
instruments at hand. 
  According to Mennicken, the Europeans' participation within 
ESA-- essentially cofinanced by the Germans--in the 
international but American-dominated Freedom space station has 
to be redefined. For, after the turn of events in the East and 
for budget reasons, the Americans decided on close cooperation 
with the Russians. A flight of the US Space Shuttle to the 
Russian Mir space station, where the Americans want to dock, is 
planned at present. In addition, a "core station" is to be built 
from American and Russian components in 1997-98. The large 
Freedom space station is still the ultimate goal. By the way, 
the Japanese have decided on a stay in this ambitious project. 
Furthermore, the Canadians too are one of the party with their 
robotic arm that they designed. 
  The Europeans have had to order substantial economizing in 
their Columbus contribution--likewise for budget reasons. For 
instance, the MTFF (Man Tended Free Flyer), i.e., a docked 
laboratory module, has been shelved. Using the new Ariane-5 
rocket as a transporter for cargo and later for people is being 
discussed now, instead of the canceled Hermes space transporter. 
On the other hand the Polar Platform scheduled for orbiting over 
both poles of the earth will come about. It is planned as a 
carrier for the new large Envisat satellites. The Europeans 
(ESA) demanded active participation in the (to be reconfigured) 
Russian-American space station. They would like to provide a 
data management system or a special antenna for communication 
between satellites, for example. 
  After the two space shuttle missions under German scientific 
leadership--D1 and D2--there will be no D3. This is an obvious 
political decision, says Mennicken. Just whether there will be a 
Europe-1 mission within ESA is still being debated at present. 
The hypersonic transporter project, along the lines of the 
Sanger (Germany) or Hotol (Great Britain) proposals, at 
the 
interface of aeronautics and astronautics, also had to be 
revised in its basic formulation nationally or within ESA, "in 
order to be able to decide in 10 or 20 years on the development 
of prototypes." 
  Mennicken joins with the call of the Federal Association of 
the German Aerospace and Armaments Industry (BDLI) to absolutely 
maintain a certain industrial base in order to be able to still 
take part at all as a partner country in international projects. 
There is a threshold that, if fallen below, has to result in a 
loss of know-how and of valuable staff members. This holds true 
all the more so when the USA together with the Russians has 
definitely decided to further pursue manned space flights too. 
<H5>  Lunar Station Is Being Debated As Ever </H5>
  The Japanese are going all out in space today after years of 
a certain reservedness. The (unmanned) Russian Mars mission is 
pending in 1994 and 1996. Three US shuttles have also come of 
age up to the Challenger replacement, the Endeavour. According 
to NASA's account, plans for a successor transport system cannot 
be financed at present. 
  According to the head of DARA, a lunar station--which was 
previously one of the visions of the German rocket pioneer and 
father of the Saturn-5 lunar rocket, Wernher von Braun--is for 
the time being not topical. However, ESA is forming a strategy 
group of space specialists, bankers and industrialists that is 
to examine this aspect. 
  Mennicken also mentions visions of space experts at Deutsche 
Aerospace AG [German Stock Corporation]. According to them, in 
cooperation with the Russians sometime in the future, helium-3, 
which occurs in practically unlimited quantities on the moon, 
could be "surface-mined," transported to the earth and be used 
here to produce energy in "clean," i.e., non-radiating, fusion 
reactors. A second vision boils down to the solution of the 
ozone hole problem. The use of laser beams in order to form 
ozone is one of the possibilities to be investigated here. 
  Whether these visions can ever be realized cannot be 
answered 
at present. But the head of DARA considers it important to 
inspire young people toward new ideas henceforth also. At any 
rate part of the impetus of the last 30 years owes itself to 
this enthusiasm. 
  DM1.737 billion have been appropriated as the total sum for 
space for fiscal year 1993 (German contribution to ESA, funds 
for the national space program including the bilateral project, 
as well as funds for the German Research Institute for Aerospace 
(DLR)). The head of DARA considers this amount "still 
considerable considering the problems in this country. Our job 
will be to focus on priorities the funds available." Additional 
potential for the exploitation of space must always to be paid 
attention to. We have to investigate, for example, "whether we 
should proceed via satellite technology in the further 
development of telecommunications." There are particularly very 
good capabilities for astronautics in Germany with its 
industrial infrastructure and with DLR's research and testing 
centers, he says.

<F P=106> [Article by Wolfgang Engelhardt: "ESA Budget Shrinks Still </F>
Further"first paragraph is FLUG REVUE introduction] 
  [TEXT] During his visit to Jena-Optronik, European Space 
Agency (ESA) Director General Jean-Marie Luton announced the 
latest developments regarding the ESA budget. The extent of ESA 
participation in a space station project will not be decided 
until 1995. 
  Primarily in response to pressure by Germany and Italy, the 
ESA will further reduce its already curtailed plans for manned 
space projects. The budget proposal recently submitted by ESA 
Director General Jean-Marie Luton, which would have totaled 
approximately 35 billion German marks [DM] by the year 2000, 
will be subjected to further cuts. This latest budget estimate 
already incorporated the elimination of DM7.5 billion from the 
long-term budget agreed upon in Grenada only a year ago. Now it 
appears that the DM5.3 billion ceiling placed on the 1994 ESA 
budget was too high. The worldwide recession has hit the ESA 
member states as well; furthermore, Germany is struggling with 
the cost of unification. Further reductions in the research 
budget and in the German contributions to the ESA are inevitable. 
  Luton plans to submit a new budget proposal in mid-December. 
This is likely to include additional cutbacks in manned space 
projects in particular. For example, it is doubtful whether the 
recently announced projects for a scaled down space station 
module, the astronaut capsule, and a transport vehicle will be 
able to be developed simultaneously, as was planned. 
  It will be impossible to determine what is important 
technologically until the negotiations between the National 
Space Agency (NASA) and Russia concerning the space station are 
closer to being finalized. Given the Russian surplus in space 
station components, the construction of a European laboratory 
module for the Alpha Station, as it is presently called, may no 
longer make as much sense. 
  This could revive plans by the ESA for a new astronaut 
capsule with high load capacity. This capsule would be capable 
of placing American and Russian as well as European astronauts, 
together with their equipment, into orbit around the Earth. This 
"Crew Transport Vehicle" could also serve as a rescue vehicle. 
  Europe could also provide a strong, reliable carrier in the 
form of the Ariane-5 rocket, the development of which is near 
completion. The Ariane 5 can transport a capsule carrying four 
pilots and a 400 kg payload into orbit, even at an equatorial 
axis of 52 degrees, as is currently being considered for the 
international space station. By no means is the ESA willing to 
relinquish its long-term objective of participating in the space 
station project. According to Luton, the organization is still 
hoping for a substantial German contribution. 
  The ESA Council will continue its discussion of future ESA 
participation in the European space station project in 
mid-December, taking in account the most recent results of the 
American-Russian talks. However, the final decision on the 
construction of a space station module and/or the astronaut 
capsule will not be made until the executive council meeting, 
which is to take place in the spring of 1995. 
  While in Jena, Luton checked into the productivity of the 
local optoelectronic firms, which would like to play a larger 
role in European space projects. He indicated that he was 
impressed by the technical caliber of Jena Optronik as well as 
by the commitment and skill of its approximately 100 workers. 
Luton will attempt to see to it that the newly organized 
aerospace plants in the new laender, with their experienced 
personnel, receive more ESA contracts. 
  This is extremely important, as the few research contracts 
awarded by the ESA to eastern German firms in 1993 totaled only 
DM1 million. This figure could reach as high as DM25 million in 
1994 if all the bids from Jena to produce optoelectronics 
components for several ESA satellite projects are accepted. 
These include the so-called Omos Ozone Telescope for the Envisat 
Environmental Satellite (DM6 million) as well as various 
components for the planned European XMM X-ray Satellite. 
  In the past, the technicians and scientists of the "VEB Carl 
Zeiss Jena" produced their cameras and sensors exclusively for 
Russian space projects, but with the breakup of the Soviet 
Union, this market has dried up. New the four reorganized and 
drastically "trimmed" parts firms with their high-quality 
products must find new markets and customers. Both the German 
Space Agency (DARA) and Deutsche Aerospace have jumped on the 
bandwagon and invested heavily in Jena.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "Coordinator Wants Fair Competition" first </F>
paragraph is FLUG REVUE introduction] 
  [TEXT] In Bonn, Dr. Reinhard Goehner, federal coordinator 
for aeronautics and aerospace, has proposed a program designed 
to help improve conditions for the aeronautics and aerospace 
industry in Germany as a business location. 
  The parliamentary state secretary in the Ministry of 
Economics took responsibility for the policy leading to the most 
recent decisions by Deutsche Aerospace AG (DASA), which will 
result in the loss of more than 10,000 additional jobs by the 
end of 1996. At the same time, however, he declared that 
industry is responsible for establishing a productive and 
competitive corporate structure, and that the federal government 
neither can nor will interfere in corporate decisions. 
  The state secretary added that the federal government has 
provided this technologically important branch of industry with 
considerable startup money, and over the past few years has 
supported the aircraft industry alone with more than 10 billion 
German marks [DM]. Now it is a matter of improving the general 
conditions within the industry. The Eight-Point Program 
emphasizes the necessary conditions for this: 
  1. The German government strongly supported a multilateral 
GATT aircraft agreement designed to bring the widely diverse 
terms of competition within the manufacturing countries closer 
together and ward off future subsidy races. 
  2. The German government is pressing for strict adherence to 
existing international commitments, particularly the US-EC Large 
Aircraft Agreement. 
  3. The German government will adjust its industrial aid 
practices to current international conditions. Goehner announced 
a "German Regulation on Aeronautical Research Policy and 
Technology Policy," to take effect in early 1994. The objective 
is a new, more effective, industrial support structure designed 
to support future research and development projects within the 
aircraft and aerospace industry. 
  4. The German government urges the EC to take aeronautical 
engineering into greater account in its fourth General Research 
Program. It would like to see an autonomous research and 
technology support program within the framework of this general 
program. 
  5. Goehner encouraged the retention of a minimum capacity 
within the defense industry. Apropos to this, he recommended 
that the German policy on the export of armaments and export 
permits be reviewed. In the course of ongoing negotiations, the 
German government has been urging that European policy on 
dual-use products be harmonized. 
  6. Goehner also supported the idea of contracting out 
Luftwaffe maintenance work to the aircraft industry. He 
applauded initiatives already taken to this end by the Federal 
Ministry of Defense. 
  7. With regard to the aerospace industry, the German 
government will support the expansion of satellite-supported 
telecommunications, navigation, and Earth observation, 
particularly for the augmentation of the national infrastructure. 
  8. The coordinator announced a public forum on Aeronautics 
and Aerospace, to be held in early 1994. This forum is to 
address the importance of the aircraft and aerospace industry to 
Germany as a business location and the long term chances for 
growth. 
  The federal coordinator acknowledged special responsibility 
for the industry in those areas in which the government acts as 
the client. This is particularly true in defense and space 
research. In both of these areas, the industry had requested 
concrete planning figures -- regarding the mass production of 
the Eurofighter 2000 or support of aerospace projects, for 
example. 
  Goehner does not believe that the current administration is 
solely to blame here, however. The opposing party must also 
accept some responsibility. No one who shoots down long-planned 
projects should complain in the same breath about the subsequent 
loss of jobs.

  [Text] Paris--The European Union will spend 16 million 
ecus, or about 105 million French francs [Fr], to underwrite one 
of the instruments for the Spot-4 satellite. The National Center 
for Space Studies (CNES) will act as chief contractor for the 
device, which has been dubbed Vegetation. The Earth observation 
satellite Spot-4 is expected to be placed into orbit around 
mid-1997. 
  The French space agency announced that the European 
Commission and the CNES 1 had signed an agreement 
to allocate 16 million ecus to the French agency for the program 
on 17 January in Paris. Besides the European Commission, France, 
Belgium, Sweden, and Italy will team up on the project, for 
which Aerospatiale (France) has been selected as chief 
industrial contractor in charge of instrument payload. 
  Europe expects to finance 50 percent of the cost of the 
Vegetation program, including manufacture of the instrument and 
construction of an image-processing center. According to the 
CNES, the Commission already plans "an additional funding 
package." 
  The CNES directed construction of the first three Spot 
satellites, in partnership with Belgium and Sweden. Spot-3 was 
placed in orbit last 26 September.

  [Text] Paris--Two ESA astronauts will represent Europe this 
year in space, by flying with Americans and Russians this fall 
aboard NASA shuttles and the Mir station. 
  For the European Space Agency (ESA), the two flights are a 
way of showing that the world's third-ranking space power, 
Europe, fully intends to defend its place in space exploration, 
and that its personnel and technologies qualify it to 
participate in building the international space station R-Alpha. 
  Europe's collaboration with Russia will begin with the first 
departure of an ESA astronaut--either the Spaniard Pedro Duque 
or the German Ulf Merbold--aboard the Soyuz-TM-20 bound for the 
Mir station. The flight, which will probably take place in 
October, will be similar to Jean-Francois Clervoy's on Columbia 
and will help give European astronauts' the broadest possible 
experience living in space. 
  The designated astronaut will be named in May or June and 
will spend a month aboard the Mir with the Russians. In 1995, 
another European, either Thomas Reiter or the Swede Christer 
Fuglesang, will spend 135 days on the Mir and will even leave 
the station for a walk in space. 
  These EuroMir-94 and -95 missions were planned before the 
final decision to shelve the West's space station Freedom, but 
after the Hermes spaceplane was "scrapped." 
  Jean-Francois Clervoy will be the fifth ESA astronaut, after 
Ulf Merbold (Germany, two flights, in 1983 and 1992), Wubbo 
Ockels (the Netherlands, 1985), Claude Nicollier (Switzerland, 
1992 and 1993), and Dirk Frimout (Belgium, 1992), to fly. 
  Clervoy will be a mission specialist, which means his 
responsibilities will equal those of Nicollier when he 
jettisoned the EURECA platform two years ago, or recovered the 
Hubble Space Telescope last December using the Endeavor 
shuttle's robot arm. 
  Currently there are no plans for another European astronaut 
to fly on American shuttles. But with the Italian Maurizio Cheli 
training as a mission specialist in Houston, surely there will 
be again. 
<H5>  Flights of ESA Astronauts or Associates </H5>
  Ulf Merbold: 
  - 1st flight from 28/11 to 8/12/1983, first Spacelab 
  flight, on Columbia; 
  - 2nd flight from 22/01 to 30/01/1992 on Discovery. 
  Wubbo Ockels: 
  - from 30/10 to 06/11/1985 during the Spacelab-D1 flight 
(Germany) on the Challenger. 
  Dirk Frimout: 
  - from 24/03 to 02/04/1992 on Atlantis. 
  Claude Nicollier: 
  - 1st flight from 31/07 to 08/08/1992 on the Endeavor 
  (EURECA mission); 
  - 2nd flight from 2 to 13/12/93, on the Endeavor (Hubble 
mission).

<F P=106> [Article from the supplement on Science and Education by </F>
Karel Knip: "The Free Piston Engine"] 
  [Excerpts] For decades it was the dream of an entire army 
of inventors: to build a combustion engine with a "free piston" 
that produced power without using the unfortunate combination of 
connecting rod and crankshaft -- in other words, a combustion 
engine without rotating parts. It is impossible to say how many 
solutions to this problem have been devised over the years. 
  However, not many of these solutions ever made it further 
than the drawing board and, eventually, all the designs 
disappeared without trace. Engineers at the Innas engineering 
bureau in Breda designed and built two interference-free 
prototypes of a "free piston unit" which has every chance of 
being the first produced on a large scale. When asked, experts 
are unanimously enthusiastic and impressed. Volvo and Daf Bus 
[Department of Daf which manufactures buses] have said they are 
"very interested." 
  It would not be true to say that the Innas "free piston 
unit" 
operates noiselessly. Even if the heavy door of the 
sound-proofed cell in the hall where the machine is set up is 
closed and the piston frequency is reduced to an impressively 
low level, simply by turning a knob, it remains impossible to 
hold a normal conversation. 
  Peter Achten, rounding off a long technical explanation with 
the noisy demonstration, wears an "I couldn't care less" 
expression. Either he no longer hears the racket or he no 
longer wants to hear it. In the exhaustive measuring and 
optimization program which he ran through with the spiritual 
father of the machine, Theo Potma, no attention has yet been 
devoted to sound production. For ease of research, the machine 
is running with no muffling worth mentioning. It is expected 
that the unit will make less noise than the diesel hydraulic 
engine which it is intended to replace. It will not be 
difficult to mount the unit free from vibration. 
  The Innas free piston unit appears to be a compact machine, 
smelling pleasantly of oil, of which precious little can be 
seen, least of all moving parts. What is most exciting is the 
picture that the computer monitor gives of the piston movement. 
Free piston movements look very unusual -- in no way comparable 
with the smooth sinusoidal movement of the piston in a 
crankshaft engine. 
  Noise measurements and life cycle trials are virtually the 
only tests to which this machine, the second operating prototype 
built by Innas, has not been subjected. For over four years, an 
average of four people have been measuring vibrations, emission, 
output, controllability and response speed. It has thus been 
established that the unit could prove a worthy replacement for 
the regular diesel hydraulic drive in forklifts, mechanical 
scoops ("shovels" as they say on television), street cleaning 
machines, garbage trucks, and city buses. The theory is that 
the Innas unit is considerably more economical and cleaner than 
the drives it can replace and, furthermore, will only require 
approximately half the space. In addition, it offers 
flexibility of control and low purchase and maintenance costs. 
[passage omitted ] 
  The output of the diesel engine within the unit is estimated 
at 50 percent, while in regular diesel hydraulic units it is 
approximately 45 percent. The absence of the mechanical 
intermediate stage between diesel engine and hydraulic pump 
(where roughly 10 percent of the loss occurs) is obviously just 
as important. The maximum overall yield of a conventional 
diesel hydraulic unit is estimated at 36 percent -- that of the 
Innas unit at 45 percent. The differences between average 
consumption outputs could be even greater. 
  So far, two working prototypes of the Innas unit have been 
built, the second "pre-production prototype" was finished this 
year and already seems a considerable improvement on the initial 
type. The maximum stroke frequency of the piston (which 
determines the delivery of the hydraulic pump) has been 
increased from 23 to 35 hertz, the hydraulic output from 60 to 
90 percent (by restricting leakage and current losses) and 
consumption by peripheral equipment has been cut from 7.5 to 5 
kw. Efforts are being made to improve the modest cylinder 
output (the extent to which combustion gases are replaced by a 
fresh fuel/air mixture). The number of sensors can perhaps be 
reduced. "The concept still has a great deal of room for 
development, there is still a lot left to perfect," says Achten. 
  An operational free piston unit is now available, with a 
maximum capacity of 20 kw (27 Horsepower) which is almost half 
the size of a conventional diesel hydraulic unit of the same 
capacity. NOx [Nitrous Oxide] measurements taken by the 
Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research [TNO] 
in Apeldoorn have shown that the emission of combustion gases 
will be below the future Euro III standard. (The emission of 
particles has not yet been measured.) [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, four new patents have been applied for with 
regard 
to the main discoveries. This summer, the BV Innas Free Piston 
Engine (IFP) was founded in order to "market" the unit. Novem 
[committee which counseled the project] thought it was time to 
look for a partner in industry. 
  Achten and Potma found this no easy task -- remember the 
Wankel syndrome and the gloomy example of Van Doorne's 
Transmission. As Van der Does of Projectbureau Warmte/Kracht 
(PWK) says: "The problem is that the Netherlands lacks an 
industrial climate." 
  The design of the Innas unit is so simple that it will 
certainly be no problem finding sufficient companies in the 
Netherlands to manufacture the engine. With the exception of the 
piston and the engine block, it can be assembled almost entirely 
using existing products. The problem is that the companies 
approached can only start production once there is a firm order 
for the sale of the machines. Potential customers such as Daf 
Bus, Volvo and the German company Linde (forklift manufacturer) 
only want to order when production is guaranteed. The young 
company IFP is still hesitant about the nature of the contracts 
which it wants to conclude with the business community. 
  One promising aspect is that Daf Bus has expressed lively 
enthusiasm about the new engine, which product planning manager 
G. Batterink refers to as "very daring and very innovative." 
"This defies all recent thinking in the field of combustion 
engines." Volvo Flygmotor of Sweden is following developments 
very closely and has already sent delegations to Breda on four 
occasions, offering far-reaching collaboration. It is claimed 
that the Innas unit could not be put to better use than in city 
buses equipped with Volvo's controversial Cumulo system for 
recycling brake energy (which Daf Bus could also buy). Cumulo 
buses have a heavy conventional diesel hydraulic drive which 
could very profitably be replaced by an Innas unit.

  [Text] In 1995 and 1996, Deutsche Bundespost's postal 
service, in conjunction with well-known industrial partners, 
will conduct large-scale trials with electric vehicles powered 
by a zinc-air system. 
  The field trial, preparations for which began back at the 
beginning of 1994 [as published], will be based on the Greven 
mail center near Muenster in Westphalia. The large-scale trial 
grew out of studies by the postal service as to how part of its 
diesel vehicle fleet could be replaced by propulsion systems 
that caused less pollution. A novel zinc-air power system 
emerged as a promising prospect, although it is not without its 
expert critics as regards the overall ecobalance. 
  However, initial tests, involving outside inspectors, on the 
new power system installed in a trial vehicle went off 
successfully at the TUeV [Technical Monitoring Board] for 
Bavaria and Saxony, its power and output values, which far 
exceeded those of conventional batteries, and its ecological 
acceptability proving particularly attractive. 
<H5>  Autonomy Range Considerably Extended </H5>
  The trials centered on use in the postal service, where 
requirements are three or four times higher than in the private 
transport sector. Whereas electric vehicles with an accumulator 
weight of 350 kg have had a range of about 40 km to date, the 
new technology permits journeys of at least 300 km. 
  The large-scale field trials scheduled to begin in 1995 will 
set out primarily to establish whether the zinc-air power system 
is economically viable and what its infrastructure requirements 
are. The latter is necessary because the power cells cannot be 
charged like conventional storage batteries: The electrodes 
have to be changed. The "worn-out" electrodes are subsequently 
regenerated, after which they are ready for reuse. This is why 
large-scale field trials can only be performed with major fleet 
operators such as the postal service. 
  In addition to the postal service, in the role of project 
leader, and Electric Fuel Limited, the inventor of the zinc-air 
system, other well-known firms have agreed to take part in the 
field trial. Some firms and town councils also want to 
participate in the trial with parts of their own fleets.

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Alhaus: "Like a Repair Shop"] </F>
  [Text] Philipp Pommerenke does not want his operation 
mistaken for an auto graveyard. "This is not going to be like in 
a factory, with a lot of noise and mountains of wrecks in the 
courtyard," says the graduate engineer; "we don't want to be a 
scrapyard but function like a modern auto repair shop." Not too 
large, extremely friendly toward the environment, without impact 
on the residents around it, easy to fit into any business area, 
are Pommerenke's terms of reference. 
  The engineer heads Berlin's newest pilot project for 
recycling old cars. The Lepkojus Innovations-Gesellschaft (LIG) 
fuer Entwicklung und Fertigung fuer Aufgaben im Umweltschutz mbH 
[Lepkojus Innovation Company for Development and Production for 
Environmental Protection Tasks Ltd.] operates this auto 
disassembly facility at a former Sero site in the city district 
of Hellersdorf. Approximately 15 vehicles a day are now being 
disposed of here. The goal is to do twice that amount. The 
principal advantage: The work is done with "nonspecific models." 
  The operator of the facility, the Alba company, once again 
"had its finger on the pulse and recognized a future market," 
praised Federal Environment Office President Dr. Heinrich von 
Lersner when the project was taken into operation. More than 2.5 
million vehicles wind up on the scrap heap each year in the FRG; 
in Berlin alone it is about 200,000. In Hellersdorf a maximum of 
7,500 scrapped cars, precisely three percent, can be recycled in 
the first expansion phase. A drop in the ocean in comparison 
with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer's goal of recycling half 
of all old cars by the year 2000. 
  The Berlin pilot project is aimed at future safety. The 
basic 
sealing of the work hall is the same as in waste dumps; 1,000 
square meters of disassembly surface was sealed with 
high-pressure polyethylene foils. Under that lies a 
10-centimeter-thick concrete plate on top of a 
20-centimeter-thick sub-base. 
  One out of every three German marks [DM] of the DM 6.6 
million investment cost--half of the expenditure was provided by 
the Federal Environment Ministry--went for soil and ground water 
protection. Waste water is led through separate dirt and 
rainwater channels, passing through an oil and coalescence 
separator. The waste water from the hot steam vehicle cleaning 
unit also flows through an de-emulsification facility. 
  Dr. Dieter Pautz, in charge of old car recycling at the 
Environment Ministry, praises the Berlin-Hellersdorf facility: 
"Here an example is being set for the integration of all known 
technologies." The Federal Government's cost sharing is for the 
purpose of "raising the level of the technology in this field." 
  Five points are of primary importance for auto recycling: 
Complete removal of fluids--so far it is only possible to drain 
about 95 percent, separation of all synthetic parts by type, 
extracting secondary raw materials, the greatest possible profit 
from sales of replacement parts and, finally, consideration for 
all ecological requirements. 
  The project has national economic proportions. If projected 
onto the entire annual German number of cars, a total of about 
1.7 million tons of metal and 450,000 tons of special waste in 
the form of oils and fluids, synthetic and compound materials, 
rubber and glass would result. Thus, professional and ecological 
disposal has its price: The Association of German Automobile 
Industry allocates DM 400 per car; experts from various 
institutes estimate DM 300 to 600. Pommerenke would like to push 
the cost down to an acceptable DM 150. 
  Utilization of replacement parts from the old cars for 
maintenance and repairs can also make a contribution. On the 
shelves at Hellersdorf are stored engines, wheels, tires, doors, 
body parts, seats, radiators, tanks, carburetors, propeller 
shafts, dashboards, gear shifts, headlights, rear lights, 
mirrors... Pommerenke manages the inventory with the help of a 
computer: "We can react quickly to customer inquiries." The 
price advantage for auto firms, private persons, car repair 
garages, reprocessing enterprises and exporters is 30 to 50 
percent below the new price. A supraregional operating system is 
being established at this time. 
  In addition to the old oil, particularly the synthetics 
require a great deal of expenditure. If the legislators actually 
decree the return of cars and exclude thermal disposal, plastic 
parts must be easily separated out and properly recycled. For 
that reason, a laboratory is already a part of Pommerenke's 
pilot project. Dr. Dietrich Schumann is often a guest. In his 
laser laboratory in Adlershof (LLA GmbH), synthetic waste 
products with various fillers, contaminations and dyes are being 
studied. As a result, a near-infrared sensor was created 
(0.7-2.5 micron wavelength), with which synthetics can be 
detected in 10 milliseconds and--in a facility down the 
line--semiautomatically separated out. A type purity of 96 
percent is to be possible. 
  With his development, the LLA marketing chief says, he can 
only succeed in industry if the method does not get too 
expensive: "There must be no DM 250,000 lasers in a recycling 
facility." The frequently black automobile synthetics make this 
more difficult: "Just as plastic parts with metallic coatings, 
they produce a type of fog when looked at with spectroscopy. The 
LLA device has now got this problem under control." 
<H5>  Trabant: No Problem </H5>
  At least 500,000 Trabants are still rolling on the roads. 
Unless it involves as few prized specimens with options for 
future increases in value, these must also be disposed of at 
some point. But the plastic bombers are not a special recycling 
case: "The Trabant is not an environmental problem," says Dr. 
Dieter Pautz, an engineer. "Anyone who wants to make money on it 
is getting a bad deal." With not quite 35 kilograms--"all of it 
uncomplicated Duroplast"--there is less synthetic material in 
the Trabant than in the Golf, for example. Recyclers can easily 
deal with this plating on bumpers, roof, doors and trunk lids.

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Lauvige: "Secrets of the Renault Sport </F>
Semiautomatic Gearbox"] 
  [Text] In racing, it cuts gearshifting time in half. On a 
passenger car, it frees the driver from the "acrobatics" 
required for each shift. The scene is the Limousin Rally, on 10 
October 1993. Approaching a tricky hairpin turn, Jean Ragnoti, 
official driver for the Renault team, is manhandling the 
stickshift of his Clio-Williams and frantically stomping on the 
clutch for a fast downshift. At the same spot, and with the same 
type of car, his teammate Philippe Bugalski, presses lightly 
with his fingers on a "joystick" without letting go of the 
steering wheel, and downshifts three speeds in record time. His 
advantage? A semiautomatic gearbox born from a collaboration 
between Renault Sport and Magneti Marelli. Tested in races, it 
should soon be installed on certain mass produced cars. 
  It is in fact a device which activates a conventional 
gearbox 
in place of the driver. It consists of two components: one is 
mounted on the box and the other on the clutch. The shift 
linkage is replaced by an electric-hydraulic mechanism with five 
small actuators (two linear and three rotary) which select and 
engage the six speeds of an H-pattern gearbox. Also, the clutch 
cable is replaced by an actuator controlled either by a solenoid 
or by the left pedal, thus leaving the driver in control of 
clutch release at certain times, such as when starting the car. 
  The pressure needed for these operations is obtained from a 
150-bar hydraulic pump which is coupled directly to the 
camshaft. Gilles Lallement, head of development at Renault 
Sport, explained that "we opted for this solution in spite of 
the great complexity presented by its implementation. The fact 
is that the very high power of these components makes it 
possible to build actuators that are sufficiently compact and 
fast, characteristics that are essential to such an application." 
  The driver therefore no longer has to expend any effort to 
shift gears. He merely has to pull up on a small handle located 
near his steering wheel to upshift and pull down on it to 
downshift. Instructions are sent to a computer which also 
receives data concerning engine speed, the speed of each wheel, 
the hydraulic pressure... about thirty parameters altogether. 
The computer then calculates the shift sequence. 
<H5>  Adapting Engine Speed </H5>
  To shift up by one or several gears, the computer sends 
instructions to the injection system which then adapts the 
engine speed to the rotation speed of the driveshaft. As soon as 
this synchronization is achieved, the shift is allowed and the 
computer activates the sequence of rotary and translation 
motions needed to engaging the selected gear. The driver can 
thus go from first to fifth while still flooring the gas pedal. 
The strategy is somewhat different for downshifting: In this 
case the computer has to enable the clutch actuator before 
engaging the gear. 
  Patrick Landon, head of the Renault Sport racing department, 
states that "the advantages of this semiautomatic box are 
undeniable in racing." Notably, it cuts in half the time needed 
for shifting: from 0.28 seconds manually for an experienced 
driver to 0.13 seconds in automatic. This means a gain of 0.38 
seconds per kilometer on a custom car! 
  For the average motorist, shaving off a few tenths of a 
second from his commute may hardly seem worth it. But he may 
well be attracted to some of the advantages of this gearbox. 
Adapted to a passenger car, it reduces physical fatigue. It is 
estimated that in city traffic, a driver shifts an average of 
fifty times per kilometer. Pushing the clutch each time, his 
left foot expends a cumulated effort of 100 to 150 newtons, 
which over a distance of 12 kilometers corresponds to moving a 
load of about 7 tons! With only one leg... 
<H5>  No More Acrobatics </H5>
  In addition, the optimization of shift sequences increases 
the life of the gearbox while software safeguards prevent 
downshifting above 8500 rpm to protect against racing the 
engine. And finally, freed from the acrobatics imposed by any 
gear shifting, the driver can concentrate totally on steering 
his vehicle. 
  These advantages are enough for Magneti Marelli to undertake 
the implementation of a version which is intended for "Everyman" 
and which can satisfy the expectations of the luxury car driver 
without frustrating lovers of the stickshift. The possibility of 
adapting it to any existing box without modifications would 
enable car manufacturers to offer this automation as an option, 
at a price lower than that of a completely automatic box. One 
version has already been unveiled at the Frankfurt Salon on an 
Alfa Romeo. Volvo also is said to be thinking of installing it 
very soon on one its top of the line models. 
<H5>  An Enticing Market </H5>
  Other equipment makers are just as convinced of the success 
of "semiautomation" for European drivers. Thus Valeo is devoting 
intense efforts to implementing a similar system. Benoist Hue, 
marketing head of the clutch division, says that "we are already 
putting a mass produced electronic clutch on some Ferraris. And 
we have a number of projects underway to get it installed on 
European cars during 1995. But we will have to wait until the 
following year for completely robotized mass production of 
gearboxes." 
  This is an extremely attractive market for the French 
equipment maker who estimates that by the year 2005, 
semiautomatic gearboxes will have taken over some 12 percent of 
European production. It remains to be seen whether Old World 
motorists can live with a joystick in their hands instead of a 
shift lever...
