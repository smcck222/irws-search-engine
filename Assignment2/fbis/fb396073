<F P=106> [Article by O.L.: "Technical Wonders of a More Austere and </F>
Less Polluting Engine"] 
  [Text] How can momentum be used to reduce fuel consumption? 
Volkswagen engineers have perfected a device which cuts the 
engine off and makes it possible to roll with a stopped engine. 
Here is how. 
  The Volkswagen engineers have made an "astounding" 
discovery. 
When a bicycle rider wants to stop, he stops pedalling! With 
this in mind, the German manufacturer is about to launch the 
first assembly line vehicle whose engine shuts off automatically 
when not in use: the Golf Ecomatic. However, what is natural on 
a bicycle is much more difficult to achieve on a car. 
<H5>  Ensuring Safety </H5>
  The first difficulty is to perfect an electronic mechanism 
capable of cutting the engine when the driver takes his foot off 
the accelerator, and of restarting it when he steps on the gas 
pedal again, while also providing a great number of related 
safety functions such as maintaining power steering, lights, or 
power brakes. The wiring must for example be switched to an 
auxiliary battery each time the engine starts to avoid any 
voltage drop caused by the starter's high power drain. 
  However, stopping and restarting the engine are not enough 
to 
recover all of the vehicle's energy. Its wheels must 
simultaneously be disconnected from the transmission so that the 
driver can exploit the momentum like a freewheeling cyclist. To 
this end, a servomechanism developed in collaboration with the 
German equipment maker Pierburg, activates the vehicle's clutch 
as soon as the gas pedal is released. This servomechanism's 
power supply when the clutch is depressed is assured by an 
electric diaphragm pump which operates independently of the 
car's engine. 
<H5>  Valuable in City Traffic </H5>
  This device does not interfere with the driving of the 
vehicle, which is operated like a regular car. The only 
difference is that when the driver takes his foot off the gas, 
the engine is turned off and the car continues on its momentum, 
noiselessly, without using up gas and without exhaust. 
  This automation device is particularly valuable in large 
urban concentrations where the engine can be shut off up to 60 
percent of the time, which very strongly affects pollution and 
mileage. This system reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 36 
percent, hydrocarbons and nitric oxides by 25 percent, and 
carbon dioxide by 21 percent. 
  Another interesting advantage is that fuel consumption is 
also reduced by one liter per hundred kilometers compared to a 
car without the equipment. But Volkswagen claims that an 
experienced driver can beat this record. How? Simply by knowing 
how to build up his momentum.

<F P=106> [Article: "Automatic Car Guidance is a Reality"] </F>
  [Text] Electronic guidance for road vehicles has left the 
domain of science fiction and entered the phase of active 
experimentation: In the coming months, 2,000 drivers in 
Ile-de-France [the Paris region] will be able to test it on a 
fleet of 350 Renault cars and vans. 
  On 18 January at the Champigny command post (Val-de-Marne), 
Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and Mr. Michel Giraud, 
president of the Ile-de-France Regional Council, formally 
inaugurated the link-up of the experimental fleet with the 
traffic monitoring information system for eastern Paris (Sirius). 
  Equipped with high-powered electronic terminals, drivers 
will 
be guided in real time, intersection after intersection. The 
equipment includes a GPS (Global Positioning System) 
position-location module and a mechanism for obtaining "finer" 
location fixes using sensors attached to the vehicle wheels. The 
computed path to destination can also be corrected "in real 
time" to adjust for traffic congestion as the terminal receiveds 
and decodes traffic monitoring data. 
  Information and computed paths are displayed on a 
liquid-crystal screen built into the dashboard. The driver sets 
the vehicle's destination: A green arrow appears showing the 
general direction, and on the left is a simplified schematic of 
the next intersection showing route to be followed, junctions, 
"Do Not Enters" (in red), and distance in meters to the next 
turn. 
  By pressing a key, the driver can see the name of the street 
along which the vehicle is currently proceeding. A soft voice 
gives a timely alert message: "Turn right in 200 meters." If the 
driver makes a mistake, the itinerary is corrected. 
  The geographic data is located on digital optical disks 
prepared with the help of the National Geographic Institute 
(IGN). The most costly part of the program is compilation of the 
maps to be entered into the laser disks. 
  The system operator is an economic interest group (GIE) made 
up by Renault, TDF, and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. The 
enterprises concerned believe it will take another two years 
before the system is totally operational and ready to be 
marketed at a price between 12,000 and 15,000 French francs. By 
that time, digital disks will have "mapped" the entire country, 
including all towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants. 
  When it was introduced in Paris, the on-board computer 
performed quite satisfactorily, handling geometrically complex 
intersections such as Place Denfert-Rochereau, indicating 
highway junction points and displaying side-roads as they 
approached one by one, along with pedestrian walkways and 
outlets of private roads. 
  The utility of the system for road transport professionals 
seems obvious (deliveries, express parcel service, taxis). With 
profitability assured from these sources, it could then be made 
available to the general public at a reasonable cost, which 
Renault believes would be comparable to an option such as air 
conditioning. Europe-wide standards should make it possible to 
prepare compatible digital maps for the most important European 
Community countries.

Defect"] 
  [Text] The TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied 
Natural Science Research] has developed a test to determine 
whether a high cholesterol level is caused by a genetic defect. 
The defect in question is located in the gene close to the 
receptor responsible for cholesterol elimination [ldl-receptor] 
and causes an hereditary form of hypercholesteremia. The test 
is a combination of pcr [polymerase chain reaction] and 
gelelectrophoresis. Dr. Paola Lombardi from the TNO Institute 
for Studies on Aging and Vascular Diseases, who obtained her 
Ph.D. with this research, claims the test is nearly flawless. 
According to her, the test is not yet being used, but will be 
introduced in hospitals in the long term. The patients' veins 
have been constricting since birth, hence the importance of 
knowing whether hypercholesteremia is hereditary.

  [Text] Soil bacteria transfer plasmids to one another on a 
large scale. Therefore, when genetically altered bacteria are 
released in nature, the foreign DNA should not be added into the 
plasmids, but into the chromosomes of these organisms. Dr. Eric 
Smit analyzed the risk of putting genetically altered 
micro-organisms in the ground. He will soon obtain a doctorate 
in Wageningen on this subject. Smit put an easily recognizable 
plasmid in bacteria and released it in various soils. Next he 
verified whether other bacteria would adopt the plasmid. This 
was primarily the case under life conditions favoring the 
micro-organisms, e.g. around the roots of plants or when 
nutrients had been added to the soil. This is probably due to a 
greater density or a greater bacterial division activity. It 
has already been known that plasmid transmission in water is 
absolutely normal.

<F P=106> [Article signed Thierry Levy-Abegnoli: "The First </F>
Object-Oriented Real Time Executive Is Born"] 
  [Text] A real-time executive developed by the French firm 
Microprocess could lead to major upheavals not just for the 
development of on-board software but also for its 
implementation. It extends the advantages of object-oriented 
technology to the whole of the application's life cycle. 
  The French company Microprocess has recently developed 
SoftKernel, a real-time executive that is unique in the world 
since it is completely object-oriented. In particular it brings 
an extreme degree of modularity to the stages of development, 
maintenance, and even operation while optimizing the available 
memory space. Moreover, the very design of SoftKernel means 
that is particularly easily ported from one microprocessor 
architecture to the next and also ensures a high level of 
application portability. In addition, with SoftKernel the 
executive and the applications form a whole. These advantages 
will become particularly evident when used with on-board 
applications which have limited resources. 
  Microprocess explains that the principle used is an 
extension 
of the microkernel concept to all parts of the executive and to 
all application programs. Thus, as with Chorus, there is a 
microkernel charged with managing the memory area (and therefore 
linked to the microprocessor). The novelty, however, lies in 
the fact that other microkernels manage the files, interrupts, 
semaphores, etc. In fact, we find more or less the same 
principle in Chorus, except that with SoftKernel it is possible 
to create a specific version of any microkernel (they are all 
written in C++, sometimes with a bit of assembly language). You 
therefore only need to make an "instantiation" (a form of 
cloning) of the standard microkernel (which is just a C++ 
object) which inherits all of its properties, and then alter it. 
Moreover, an application will itself be produced by the 
instantiation of the "task" microkernel. 
  This architecture makes it possible to optimize the 
available 
resources without any particular effort, since several 
applications can share a set of microkernels and thus share the 
same code. For example, in a fax machine, the applications 
controlling the document scanner and the user interface will 
both communicate with the application controlling the line. 
Product designer Bertrand Dautrevaux explained: "It would be 
possible to do the same thing with a conventional executive and 
programs written in C, but then you would have to make sure that 
there was no conflict between the different applications. With 
SoftKernel you do not run any such risk." A number of different 
developers can therefore easily work in parallel on the same 
project. 
<H5>  Modularity Preserved In The Operating Stage </H5>
  This modularity is also expressed in other ways. Thanks to 
dynamic links established when the application is run, the basic 
and application microkernels can be loaded unsequenced into 
memory. It is therefore a simple task to replace one 
application microkernel with another, even on the target system 
itself and especially if it is equipped with flash memory. This 
then makes it simple to produce different versions of a product, 
or an open-ended product (for example, one which could take 
add-on communication protocols). In addition, it would be 
possible to order the transfer of certain "critical" 
microkernels, for example from ROM [read-only memory] to RAM 
[random access memory], so as to optimize performance. In 
Bernard Dautrevaux's opinion: "Such functions are impossible 
using conventional techniques because the applications are 
monolithic. Even if developers write in C++, if they use a 
traditional executive then the executable code will be 
monolithic. Therefore the advantage of the inherent modularity 
of object-oriented technology is only felt at the development 
stage." 
  The development of SoftKernel took just seven man-years, 
plus 
10 man-years for the development environment. Bernard 
Dautrevaux again: "That is a lot less than was needed for 
Chorus, but then SoftKernel is only an executive, not a true 
operating system." 
  For the time being, SoftKernel has been ported to Motorola 
68000, Intel 8086 (real mode) and 386 (protected mode) and Sparc 
architectures. Porting to ARM is also being examined. Of 
course, this executive is aimed at industrial-type real-time 
applications, but it is also aimed at voluminous on-board 
applications with resources in the order of 64K of ROM and the 
same amount of RAM: for example, intelligent radiotelephones, 
small printers, and military applications. Microprocess does 
not, however, intend to compete with the Apple Newton or 
Microsoft At Work technologies which are aimed at more evolved, 
resource-greedy applications.

<F P=106> [Article by P.W.: "Parallel Computers Expected to Help in </F>
Optimizing Complex Productions; Consortium Composed of Companies 
and Universities Is Developing New Software and Improved 
Computer Performance; Initial Results at Start of 1994"] 
  [Text] Aachen--The economic recession and the rising 
pressure of competition are forcing many companies to reduce 
costs more sharply. New techniques for parallel computers should 
now make possible extensive optimizations in the planning and 
production processes. Moreover, the Aachen firm Parsytec 
Computer, Ltd., (Juelicher Strasse 338, 52070 Aachen) has formed 
the Pamips (Parallel Mixed Integer Programming Systems) 
consortium. It has been reported that, together with BASF [Baden 
Anilin and Soda Factory], Inc., Ludwigshafen, Gesa, Palma de 
Mallorca, and Dash, Coventry, as well as the Universities of 
Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven, these techniques are to be 
used industrially. The developers expect to have the initial 
results as soon as the beginning of 1994. 
  In industries with high production volumes that are 
distributed among many individual products, efficiency depends 
on the cost structure. A reduction in production costs can, for 
example, be achieved through better use of raw materials as well 
as better use of the means of production through minimization of 
machines' service life. Another important factor in optimizing 
production is firms' global organization with production sites 
distributed worldwide. With them costs can be reduced through 
deciding on a day-to-day basis where a given product is to be 
produced on the most favorable terms. The prerequisite for this, 
however, is consideration of the various costs for wages, raw 
materials, energy, and shipping, as well as currency exchange 
rates. These formulations are similar to those involved in 
long-range planning for major investments in, for example, the 
energy supply sector or commercial airlines. Costs can be cut 
this way inasmuch as sound prognoses of needs, new products with 
lengthy development periods, and the scheduling of fewer 
expensive resources could be submitted. But up to now this too 
has failed to materialize due to a lack of software and computer 
power. In this area computer-supported production optimizations 
and process simulations can only solve small parts of the 
problem because of their traditional computer architecture. 
  What is required for this are discrete optimization 
techniques that go far beyond the range of the classical "linear 
programming approach" that stems from operation research. 
Discrete, integral, binary, and semicontinuous variables have to 
be included too in order to portray a discrete selection or 
binary decisions in a model way. This is why for over five years 
algorithms have been developed that make use of massive 
parallelism. The goal of the Pamips consortium that has now been 
formed is to for the first time solve major optimizaiton 
problems of relevance to industry with the aid of massive 
parallelism. Thefirms BASA and Gesa bring into the project 
different ways of looking at unsolved problems and the know-how 
to create models from the fields of chemistry and energy supply. 
With its Xpress-MP product, Dash is one of the leading companies 
in the optimization software market and provides the basis for 
implementing the management of problems. New algorithms and 
approahes to implementation have been developed at the 
Universities of Buckingham, Heidelberg, and Leuven. The Aachen 
firm Parsytec is assembling the hardware and software with the 
North Rhine-Westphalia Center for Industrial Applications of 
Massive Parallelism (ZIAM) and has taken over the marketing, 
especially in Germany. The Pamips optimization method is soon to 
be incorporated into the ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for 
Information Technologies] project and provided with aid. The 
parallelized version of the Xpress-MP should be available to 
users for a test phase for the first time at the start of 1994 
for Parsytec GC and XPlorer Computing.

<H5>  Alternative to Conventional Computer Technologies. </H5>
<H5>  Output Can Be Flexibly Adapted to Particular Task. </H5>
  Technologies of the 21st century. VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 17 Dec 
93. Parallel computers have crossed the threshold from research 
stage to industrial utilization. With the help of this key 
technology, users want to solve a series of problems that until 
now had been reserved for the considerably more expensive 
high-performance computers. 
  "If technical progress in car making had been as speedy as 
in 
the computer field, then you could buy an S-class limousine for 
DM5, including air conditioning, car phone, and air bag." This 
is how Dr. Andreas vom Hemdt, business manager of the Center for 
Industrial Uses of Massive Parallelity (Ziam, Herzogenrath), 
described the tremendous jumps that occurred in the price/output 
ratio. 
  What does the future of the high-performance computer look 
like? Do we need any more improvements in the output? "It seems 
as there are no limits to what people want the computer makers 
to come up with," commented vom Hemdt. This is because, when it 
comes to the "great challenges," such as nuclear physics, the 
genome project, or improved weather forecasts, basic researchers 
demand more and more computer power. And users from all fields 
of activity, such as engineers, physicians, car makers, aircraft 
makers, or city planners right now need computer output in the 
200-GFlops class, in other words, 200 x 10[.sup]9[/] 
floating-point operations per second. 
  The Ziam boss is convinced that the required high and also 
payable computer output cannot be attained by the next decade 
with conventional computer technology. Nevertheless, he argues, 
the limit of the output in the conventional sequential computer 
era is in sight in spite of all of the progress that has been 
made at work stations and supercomputers. Only a few powers of 
ten today separate processor technology from the final physical 
barrier of the speed of light when it comes to signal transport. 
Besides, the financial border has long been crossed: Very few 
university computer centers and big corporations could afford 
supercomputers with a price tag of DM20 million and more. 
  Parallel computers are increasingly replacing the 
traditional 
vectorial high-performance computers and, according to vom Hemdt 
"will become the industrial key technology in the coming years." 
Massive parallel computers with hundreds and thousands of 
processors can adapt their computation output to the particular 
problem because the number of processors can be increased 
theoretically without limit. This extreme scalability and the 
resultant good price/output ratio open up new fields of 
employment and opportunities on the market as did personal 
computers 15 years ago. Many hardware makers are preparing 
products for the new basic technology of parallel processing and 
more and more conventional user programs are ready for 
industrial employment. 
  For example, the big system maker Sentec Software, Hilden, 
which specializes in parallel computer technology, developed an 
image processing unit that ensures constant quality in filling 
beer bottles. Figuring on an output rate of 80,000 bottles per 
hour, it may well happen that bottles are equipped with tops and 
labels of the preceding beverage, particularly after a switch to 
a different beverage type. High-speed image processing 
recognizes such errors in real time and causes a claw to remove 
these bottles from the flow of material. 
  Sentec emphasizes the quick ability to learn and the 
manifold 
employment possibilities. Project manager Peter Plapper noted 
that, when it comes to starting the system up, the sample of the 
objects to be investigated could be learned "in a simple 
teach-in step." Since the system generally recognizes writing 
and geometries, it is also useful for quick analyses in the 
textile industry, precision mechanics, or testing technique. 
  Another example is a process developed by Condat GmbH, 
Fernhag, that can be used to simulate the dynamic failure of 
composite materials under shock and other stresses. In the auto 
industry, for example, one can use this method to analyze the 
elastic behavior of high-strength fiber materials and the 
gradual transition between intact and destroyed material. A 
neuronal software sees to it that one of the fastest ZIP code 
number conversions in Germany can be successfully accomplished 
on a parallel computer, that is, the Parsytec-GC with 1,024 
processors. In May 1993, around 4.4 million customer data of the 
Company for Payment Systems, Frankfurt/Main, were updated within 
a few hours during this spectacular demonstration. 
  Ziam business manager vom Hemdt is convinced that "new high 
technologies, such as massive parallel processing (MPP) cannot 
be used in research and development in the context of 
international competition without government subsidies." For the 
"Real World Computing" Project--in whose context MPP is being 
promoted--Japan spends DM2.2 billion, while in the United 
States, the government in 1993 is funneling DM1.3 billion in as 
direct government subsidies, and the growth rate keeps going up. 
In addition, American MPP makers reportedly are getting massive 
support as a result of the procurement policy pursued by public 
research institutions and the military establishment. 
  When an English Meiko parallel computer was ordered by 
Lawrence Livermore Lab, there was a massive wave of protests in 
the United States; or when Parsytec of Germany wanted to deliver 
machines to the universities of Chicago and Moscow, the United 
States Administration slowed the European competition down with 
CoCom blockades dating back to the time of the Cold War. 
  Vom Hemdt mentioned other negative examples: One of the 
biggest German industrial enterprises referred to as "Bank With 
Electronic Workshop," is combining job positions and instead 
sells supercomputers from Kendall Square or Fujitsu under the 
trademark Siemens to German universities in Munich or Aachen. 
Thinking Machines installed its computers in Wuppertal or St. 
Augustin; Intel hits the competition from Aachen with a machine 
delivered to the Juelich research facility. 
  As a result of this procurement policy pursued by German and 
partly also European institutions, taxpayers are bound to find 
themselves in the rather odd situation of subsidizing American 
computer makers and promoting the development of the next 
American computer generation. On the other hand, it is charged, 
European supercomputer makers depend on direct subsidies for 
development. 
  The research policy pursued in the EC, in the Federal 
Republic, and in North Rhine-Westphalia reportedly took these 
needs into account by means of programs and specific individual 
measures, for example, by means of Cardinal Point 3.1 in Esprit 
III, the Suprenum Project, which is worth mentioning in spite of 
commercial disaster, or the North Rhine-Westphalia initiative 
entitled Parallel Data Processing. 
<H5>  Parallel Computers </H5>
  Parallel computers attain their high computer output, which 
can exceed the output of conventional supercomputers, by 
allowing a number of microprocessors to work together. 
Theoretically, the number is unlimited; starting as of 100 
microcomputers, experts speak in terms of "Massively Parallel 
Processing" (MPP systems). 
  To be sure, each individual chip is much slower than the 
very 
core of a conventional supercomputer, but their large number 
more than makes up for this. The mostly simple microprocessors 
can be produced in vast numbers and make parallel computers much 
more cost-efficient than conventional supercomputers that, in 
their simple version, already cost about DM0.5 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Ruth Henke: "Computer Solves Complex Problems"] </F>
  [Text] VDI-N, Cologne, 17 Dec 93. Application programs for 
industrial practice are being developed. One program is intended 
to plan airline routes worldwide. The core of the new Center 
for Parallel Computing at the University of Cologne is a 
massively parallel computer with 1,024 processors. In 
cooperation with companies, the Cologne scientists want to 
develop practical applications for industry on the 
high-performance computer. 
  The Cologne supercomputer is only the second of its kind in 
Germany. Its twin stands in the University of Paderborn. With 
their output data amounting to a maximum of 4.4 GFlops, 4 GByte 
main memory, and 5 GByte/sec communications bandwidth, the 
computers are "top-of-the-line, worldwide," as Michael Wottowa 
proudly assures his Cologne system managers. Together with 
physicist Thomas Pfenning, the mathematician looks after 
programs for the high-performance computer. 
  The financing for the Parsytec GCel3-type computer, which 
has 
a price tag of DM4.5 million on it, came to the extent of 
one-quarter, each, from the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, DLR 
(German Aerospace Research Institute), a price cut by maker 
Parsytec in Aachen, and funds from the European Community. In an 
effort to make sure that the lead held by the United States and 
Japan in this field would not grow any further, the EC is 
supporting four supercomputing centers in Cologne, Paderborn, 
Amsterdam, and Athens as part of the ZEUS ("Centers for European 
Supercomputing") initiative. 
  With the help of their own application programs, the 
European 
high-performance computer centers are to try to find ways of 
transferring the output of massively parallel computing to 
industrial practice. The supercomputer with the noble, 
black-blue frog design today already displayed its special 
strength during multiple runs of the same program with different 
parameters. In this case, each processor gets an identical 
version of the program and only the parameters are newly 
determined. 
  Michael Wottowa is convinced that the "parallel computer is 
also particularly suitable for field decomposition processes." 
That applies, for example, to the expensive programs used by the 
Cologne meteorologists who can calculate medium-term weather 
forecasts and the propagation of noxious substances using the 
Parsytec computer. To do that, they subdivide the air envelope 
of the earth as a two-dimensional surface with a certain size, 
and from that, they model a grid for the computer. Each computer 
then gets a part of the grid-oriented problem to process. But, 
first of all, the weather forecasters "must transfer several 
tens of thousands of lines of weather code to the computer," 
reports the system manager in discussing the status of the 
weather forecasting project. "Just transferring such tremendous 
volumes of data can take weeks," Wottowa figures out in an 
effort to illustrate the dimensions of the programs. 
  The Power Systems Institute of the DLR is working on a 
computer-intensive project called Aerodynamics Simulation of 
Aircraft Power Plants. The aviation specialists replicate 
various shapes and arrangements of rotor blades in a jet engine 
as well as the combustion processes on the screen. Aircraft 
makers and engine makers hope--with the help of computer 
results--"to be able to optimize propulsion and to reduce noise 
emissions and fuel consumption," explained physicist Thomas 
Pfenning in emphasizing the industrial benefits to be derived 
from the program. 
  One of the hardest nuts to crack for the supercomputer is 
the 
flight optimization program. Building on a demand model, the 
German Lufthansa wants to get out of the red. But something that 
looks simple at first sight turns out to be a complex task. The 
program must consider the booking data, the utilization of the 
individual seat classes of all major airlines, all types of 
passenger aircraft, and the data from the international airports. 
  New, worldwide route planning and improved seat utilization 
are to be the result. Processes used hitherto cannot do that. 
"Just a short time ago, flight plans were fed in manually on 
little cards and the computer programs are very restricted," 
smiled Thomas Pfenning. But the very next flight plan, he hopes, 
"will be made on a mathematical basis, even if the complete 
program is not yet ready." 
  Another traffic program, the simulation of traffic jams, 
revealed some rather baffling results on the new computer. Here 
it was not computer architecture but rather only the high 
computer output that was decisive. The Cologne physicists wanted 
to find out "why traffic buildups are formed when there is no 
visible traffic obstacle and how these traffic jams can be 
prevented." Here are the astonishing answers the computer came 
up with: Buildups that keep the driving speed down are necessary 
to move as many cars as possible over the roads in a high 
traffic volume situation. Less cars can be driven overall on a 
three-lane superhighway than on a two-lane road with strict 
driving tempo requirements, the program figured out. 
  "Differing speeds, individual driving styles, and numerous 
passing maneuvers covering several lanes demand space and 
inevitably lead to jams," said Pfenning in explaining the 
results. The men in Cologne want to feed current data from 
much-traveled sections of highway into the computer soon so as 
to be able to spot the traffic buildup even before it develops. 
Many drivers will then perhaps get to their destinations faster 
if they follow the speeds recommended by the computer. 
  With the help of other, practice-oriented programs, Michael 
Wottowa wants "to prove to industry that big problems can be 
solved with parallel computers." For instance, the 
mathematicians in Cologne, in cooperation with a specialized 
software producer, are trying to put together shipping run plans 
for moving companies. Language researchers are using neuronal 
networks to design a machine translation program for spoken 
language. The economic data processing specialists are focusing 
on problems dealing with production control and credit ratings 
when it comes to borrowing money. 
  Thomas Pfenning is convinced that "one can achieve a big 
speedup in computer output only if one lets several processors 
work on the same problem." But because there is very little in 
the way of adequate past experience or standards, the most 
important thing first of all is to solve the problems of 
massively parallel computing to begin with. Supercomputers are 
still an expensive development project--a case for the expert, 
in other words. 
  Here is the next task that is planned for this series of 
"Technologies of the 21st Century"--research for the 
communications company.

  [Text] A group of switchable molecules which when "switched 
on" conduct electrical current and when "switched off" serve as 
insulators has been produced by French scientists. These 
molecules might be used some day in organic computers to 
transmit impulses. Such computers would be many times more 
advanced in calculating time and storage capacity than today's 
computers of comparable size made with silicon semiconductors, 
because the components would be significantly smaller. 
  As reported by the research group in the Journal of the 
Chemical Society, Chemical Communications (1993, Number 18, page 
1439), the molecules can be chemically altered by irradiation 
with ultraviolet light. A new bond is formed between two parts 
of the molecules. This brings about a new structure which 
conducts electrical current, unlike the original molecule. If 
the molecules are irradiated with infrared light, the new bond 
is dissolved again. The original condition is restored and the 
molecules no longer conduct electricity. 
  The molecules owe their special abilities to the 
circumstance 
that two thiophene rings are close to one another. In the 
transformation electrons are displaced, bringing about a 
socalled conjugate system. This arrangement of bonded electron 
pairs permits electrons to migrate, i.e. permits current to flow. 
  In addition the molecules have the property that they react 
to light of completely different wavelengths in the "on" and 
"off" states. This is important in making switching on and off 
possible, and also serves to distinguish between the two states. 
  The path to molecular computers is still a long one: The 
molecules must be precisely adjusted and incorporated into a 
complex system of components. This could be achieved if the 
molecules are arranged in ultrathin layers. Nobel prizewinner 
Jean-Marie Lehn, leader of the research team at the College de 
France in Paris, expressed himself cautiously in a report in the 
journal New Scientist (1003, Number 1901, page 16): "We have 
only created a basic unit."

Technologies of the 21st Century": "Photonics: Future of 
Broadband Technology. Light for Communication. Communication 
Networks Becoming the `Optical Ether' With Circuits for Lasers"; 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Berlin, 14 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--Microelectronics in 
optical-fiber transmitting and receiving peripherals still 
decide the transmission capacity of optical systems. However, in 
the future photonics--optoelectronic signal processing--will 
decide the traffic capacity of broadband networks. 
  Less than 0.005 percent of the more than 50 Tbps (equal to 
50,000 Gbps) estimated transmission capacity ("bandwidth") of a 
single optical fiber is being used today. And even if one takes 
into account the fact that the required cascading of 
intermediate repeaters reduces this bandwidth to perhaps 5 Tbps, 
a nearly inexhaustible potential remains. This is reassuring to 
communications engineers, because it is becoming more and more 
obvious that retreading is in store for the largest and most 
complex machines--worldwide telecommunications systems. 
  If multimedia terminals capable of video teleconferencing 
come of PCs, "it is unlikely that such machines will make do 
with 64 kbps," for instance, says John Buckley of British 
Telecom Laboratories (BTL) in referring to the foreseeable 
bottlenecks in the narrowband ISDN. And, in addition, the 
transmission capacity requirements will shoot up with mobile 
communications, if because of a shortage of terrestrial 
frequencies the base stations of the cells have to be connected 
via optical fiber dedicated-circuit networks. Specialists like 
Buckley estimate that within two decades with an average user 
bandwidth of 100 Mbps the traffic in national networks will 
increase to a total of 150 Tbps. It must be at around 75 Gbps 
today in Germany. 
  So, the trend toward bit transfer rates rising into the 
multigigabit range will continue undiminished: 2.5 Gbps systems 
are already the state of the art, and 10 Gbps systems are about 
to be introduced. The electronic components for 40-Gbps links 
are already being developed in the laboratory. And with plans 
for bit transfer rates of 100 Gbps, engineers and scientists are 
already looking beyond even these targets, which should be 
attained in approximately four to five years. 
  Photonics is still confined to optical-fiber external 
wiring. 
Optical signal representation is employed only in point-to-point 
connections, with a transmitting laser at the input and a 
receiving diode at the output of the optical-fiber link. 
Microelectronics predominate in terminals and network nodes: The 
gating and switching as well as the subsequent processing of 
digital signals take place electronically. 
  No one doubts that fast electronic circuits based on gallium 
arsenide semiconductors, as those being developed by Siemens, 
Alcatel SEL and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State 
Physics (IAF) in Freiburg, for example, can cope with bit 
transfer rates of 40 Gbps and more. However, as matters stand, 
the potential bottlenecks are becoming fewer in communication 
systems, "but are to be found in network nodes," Sonny Johanson 
of Swedish Ellemtel reckons. "It is important to avoid eyes of 
the needle that substantially restrict use of the network." 
  The drawbacks of electronic switching stages at switching 
centers are obvious with ever increasing data rates. "Signals 
are processed bit by bit in such switches, so that power 
consumption could prove to be problematic," says communications 
engineer Hans Melchior of ETH [Swiss Technical College] in 
Zurich, cautioning against a strategy of "more of the same." And 
if electronic circuits can no longer keep pace because of the 
high data rates, "the switching medium at switching centers will 
inevitably have to be optical," Buckley of BTL believes. This 
means that photonic components will have to take over both 
space-division, time-division, and frequency-division multiplex 
functions in communication systems (see below). 
<H5>  Photonics </H5>
  By means of photonics, in the future signals are no longer 
to 
be subject to any kind of conversion from an optical to 
electronic representation on the way from the transmitter to the 
destination station. This means that photonic components will 
have to take over both space-division, time-division, and 
frequency-division multiplex functions in communication systems: 
  Space division multiplex stages are switching 
arrangements that direct the signal from an input optical fiber 
to the desired output optical fiber. 
  In time division multiplex stages the timing 
sequence (timing relationship) of packets interleaved with one 
another is changed from various terminals according to the 
destination. They require ultrafast optical switching devices 
and optical buffers. 
  In frequency division multiplex stages the 
switching process consists in converting the desired signal from 
one light carrier at frequency f[.sup]1[/] to another at 
frequency f[.sup]2[/] . 
  Several of these functions have already been implemented in 
the laboratory by means of photonic switching devices. For 
instance, engineers at Alcatel SEL AG in Stuttgart have 
developed a "Y-laser" whose Y-type optical waveguide with one 
input and two outputs makes it possible to use it as a signal 
splitter or optical filter. As the basic module of a 
space-division multiplex stage the just 1.5 x 1 mm[.sup]2[/] 
device can guide optical signals transparently to one optical 
fiber output or another, and as the fast switch of a time 
division multiplex stage it can also extract individual 
packets--ATM cells, for example--from the optical bit stream. 
Scientists at the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin 
demonstrated in the past year by means of a nonlinear 
semiconductor laser the same function in connection with 
synchronous frequency conversion. 
  Into which network level these functions will be placed is 
thus far still an open question. For, with the almost unlimited 
transmission capacity of optical fibers, the network topology 
can in principle be simplified to a great extent: If the entire 
bandwidth is available at the subscriber station, no central 
office is needed any longer, and the terminals themselves can 
select the channel on which to communicate. 
  "The core network is both simple and passive, then," says 
John Buckley of BTL, "but this simplicity is paid for by the 
availability of the full bandwidth at the terminals." Such a 
futuristic network is making the rounds among specialists as the 
"optical ether," because it bears a resemblance to terrestrial 
radio traffic through the "ether." According to this plan the 
optical fiber network would have a function similar to that of 
the data bus in the backplane of a computer. For instance, just 
as one inserts special cards into slots in a computer, new 
services would be offered then through the functionality of the 
terminals. 
  As simple as this idea seems to be, the way to implement it 
is just as unclear. Rather, photonics is like a lottery for the 
semiconductor industry: One cannot predict today which ticket 
will win and which components will later on lead to value added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Matra: Second Order for </F>
Development of the Brevel"] 
  [Text] GIE Eurodrome, the jointly owned subsidiary of 
MATRA DEFENSE (France) and STN Systemtechnik Nord (Germany), 
have received an order from the German and French Governments to 
proceed with the second batch for development of the 
surveillance system by Brevel drones. The Brevel, intended for 
the operational needs of the French and German Armies, has been 
in development since October 1992 under an overall contract 
worth 1400 million FF [French Francs] (approximately 400 million 
DM [Deutsche Marks]), for a six-year period. Several technically 
ambitious subassemblies have already been developed for the 
program by MATRA DEFENSE and STN Systemtechnik Nord and are 
being tested intensively. The Brevel is an observation system 
built around drones (small pilotless aircraft) carrying IR 
camera and transmitting images of the area covered to a ground 
station in real time, during the day or at night. The ground 
reception station controls the drones and image processing. 
Because it is small, stealthy, easy to handle and move and 
highly reliable, the Brevel is ideal for executing dangerous 
reconnaissance missions with maximum precision and without 
involving a threat to the life of a pilot. The current 
political situation in Europe requires means for coping with 
crises, particularly, surveillance systems capable of providing 
civil and military authorities with data on which to base 
decisions. Because of its stealth qualities and resistance to 
all types of jamming an because it is remote guided, the Brevel 
is ideal for such missions.

<F P=106> [Report signed Yvon Avenel: "Military Tracking Precision </F>
Multiplied Tenfold"] 
  [Text] Military tracking is making progress. Traditional 
radar technologies can now offer decametric precision (at long 
ranges). Radars using conventional video cameras controlled by 
operators or one of the many GPS [global positioning system] 
technologies (differential or with an inertial unit) can reach 
precisions of one meter or even one half meter. This precision 
has just been multiplied by a factor of 10 with the tracking 
system (Master) recently developed by Sfim Industries. This 
system is thus capable of locating and automatically tracking a 
high-speed target at a distance of 1,500 m (for example, an 
anti-tank missile) with a precision of 5 cm in real time (the 
"delay" is two video frames, i.e. 40 ms) and in the region of 1 
cm in deferred time after automatic image analysis. A new 
generation of distance measurement systems currently being 
developed for the DGA [French General Armaments Delegation] 
(footnote 1) (The DGA is to purchase this system for testing 
future sub-munition missiles (of the Bonus-type, developed by 
Intertechniques with Sweden] will make it possible to 
simultaneously pick up 20 targets in real time and accurately 
track the progress of five of them, although in this case there 
will be a slight loss of precision. According to Project 
manager Patrice Huver: "It is not the tracking that is the most 
complex thing to achieve, but the robustness of the processing 
-- you need similarity criteria so that when two targets cross 
over they are not mixed up." Target tracking is ensured by a 
double image-processing technique: contrast analysis (resolution 
is 5 percent) and correlation (for each frame, the movement of 
the target is measured against its last position and is compared 
with its previous trajectory stored in memory). 
<H5>  Benefits of Software </H5>
  This high performance has mostly been made possible by 
developments in the hardware and software of new image 
processing systems which include specific real-time processors, 
and the development of servo-control systems for the turrets 
(footnote 2) (internal model control-type which takes into 
account the modeled behavior of all turret components) that 
contain the various pieces of image acquisition equipment (video 
cameras, infra-red technology, laser range-finder, etc.). 
  In addition to the control and launch tests envisaged by the 
DGA and NATO, the applications of these tracking systems are 
military (firing control for a weapons system), but also 
industrial and medical. Automatic, high-precision tracking 
could be used to produce sensitive land or sea site surveillance 
equipment or to develop equipment for localization or assisting 
large vessels in delicate port maneuvers. Work is said to be 
underway to adapt these systems for use with robots required in 
extreme operating conditions. In medical research, distance 
measuring equipment could be used to monitor or count bacteria 
or viruses viewed in an electron microscope. Other applications 
include high-speed top-of-the-range industrial process control 
and television (for automatic air photography, tracking aircraft 
or missiles, sporting events covered from a helicopter, etc.).

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aerospatiale: First Firing of </F>
Ground Version of the Aster 30"] 
  [Text] Under prime contractorship of AEROSPATIALE, a 
ground- air Aster 30 missile was fired for the first time at the 
Landes Test Center of DGA, using a ground launcher designed by 
the Italian group ALENIA. The firing represents a key state in 
test and development of the anti-missile Surface-Air Medium 
Range Ground Weapon system (SAMP/T). 
  The Aster missile has been designed to intercept and 
structurally destroy new generation aircraft and air-surface or 
surface-surface missiles having high maneuvrability and high 
speed. It is a two-stage powder missile with highly agile 
second stage obtained by a Pif-Paf piloting system combining 
aerodynamic and force piloting to destroy enemy missile. The 
SAMP/T system, built around ground based Aster missiles is 
designed for protection of the battlefield area, air bases, 
command stations and all sensitive targets. By the end of this 
century, the first operators will be the French and Italian 
Armies and the French Air Force. For the latter, it will be 
superseding the American Hawk system. 
  Consequently, the vertical launch procedure of the Aster 30 
has now been approved. Various subassemblies involved in a 
firing of this type: The missile itself, the launcher container 
tube on the ground and the launch ramp have been tested in 
configuration similar to operational version. AEROSPATIALE was 
in charge of the test which is part of a project for the 
development of ground and naval medium-range surface-air defense 
systems. In this program, EUROSAM (AEROSPATIALE, ALENIA, 
THOMSON) is prime contractor.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Schwarz: "Radar for the Next Fighters" first </F>
paragraph is FLUG REVUE introduction] 
  [TEXT] Although the radar systems for the Eurofighter and 
the Rafale are still undergoing testing, European electronics 
giants are already busy with the next generation. In mid-October 
1993, the British-French firm GEC Thomson Airborne Radar 
received a contract to develop a system with active send/receive 
elements such as that which will soon be available in the United 
States. The European product could be operational by 2010, at 
which time it could be utilized in new tactical aircraft or for 
a modernization of the fighter aircraft currently under 
development. 
  Thomson CSF and GEC Marconi Avionics have already completed 
a 
great deal of preliminary work for the AMSAR (Airborne Multirole 
Solid-state Active-array Radar) over the past three years, and 
will invest approximately 25 million more German marks [DM] of 
their own funds. The contract awarded by the French Delegation 
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale pour l'Armement amounts to nearly DM50 
million. 
  This sum should enable scientists to conclude the 
preliminary 
work necessary for the construction of the active-array radar. 
The most important prerequisite is the processing of the 
gallium-arsenide, which is the most important component in the 
1,500 to 2,000 send/receive modules. Additional studies are also 
needed on the assembly and cooling of these components. Last but 
by no means least, it must be ascertained how the system can be 
manufactured at an acceptable price. 
  The AMSAR program is divided into two phases. The year 2005 
is the approximate target date for the production and test 
flight of a fully operational system. The total cost will amount 
to more than DM400 million. This investment is essential, 
however, if Europe is not to fall behind in the field of radar 
technology. "This level of development is only possible through 
European-wide cooperation," explains Bernard Rocquemont of 
Thomson-CSF. Consequently, talks are already ongoing with the 
German government and German industry concerning the 
participation of Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and/or Siemens.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "European Combat Plane's Initial Flight </F>
Scheduled for April"] 
  [Text] Bonn--A spokesman for the German Ministry of Defense 
announced on 30 December that the first flight of the European 
combat plane (ACE) Eurofighter has been set for next April. 
  The Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug Gmbh company had indicated in 
October that this initial flight was not likely to take place 
before the beginning of 1994. The first test flight was to have 
occurred over one year ago but the program schedule, upset by 
the decision to build a simplified and less costly version of 
the ACE, had been set back to last fall, then delayed once more 
when the British firm CEC Marconi Avionics encountered problems 
with flight control software. 
  The 3 January issue of the magazine DER SPIEGEL announced 
that financing for the Eurofighter is short one billion 
deutschemarks (about 3.5 billion francs). It also stated that 
DASA, subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, billed an additional 940 
million marks to the Ministry of Defense and 740 million marks 
to NEFMA, the company managing the Eurofighter project. But the 
1994 defense budget only allows 520 million marks for the 
Eurofighter. 
  The Defense spokesman confirmed DASA's additional request, 
asserting however that it only amounts to 650 million marks. He 
also indicated that the amount for which the company is 
responsible has to be determined.

<F P=106> [Article: "Test Flights of Saab's JAS 39-Gripen Halted"] </F>
  [Text]Paris - Trollhaettan -- On 21 January, a spokesperson 
for Volvo Flygmotor, the aeronautical branch of Sweden's leading 
industrial group at Trollhaettan, announced that test flights of 
Sweden's Saab JAS 39-Gripen military aircraft have been halted 
as the result of the breakage, a week ago, of a blade inside the 
RM12 turbine engine that the aircraft is equipped with. 
  According to the spokesperson, Sweden's military authorities 
grew very circumspect after a Saab JAS 39-Gripen crashed on 8 
August 1993, during a demonstration, near the downtown area of 
Sweden's capital. The pilot could no longer steer the aircraft 
because of a failure in the control lever. 
  During a test bench session "sizable vibrations" 
were registered in the engine's turbine.

  [Text] Paris--The Franco-German firm Eurocopter has decided 
to revamp its Tiger program by expanding the number of combat 
helicopter versions to five to meet German and British needs. 
  The Tiger will evolve into "an 80-percent standard 
helicopter, to which different equipment will be added as 
needed," said Eurocopter president Jean-Francois Bigay. 
Industrialization of the helicopter is slated for early 1995, 
following the recent signature of a government agreement between 
France and Germany. 
  Initial designs called for two versions: an antitank 
helicopter dubbed Tiger, and a battlefield version christened 
Gerfaut. France plans to buy 140 Tigers and 75 Gerfauts, which 
the army has just renamed Tiger. Budget difficulties and a new 
strategic context have prompted Germany to cut back its need for 
Tigers (which it calls UHUs) to 75 for the 1993-2003 period. 
Germany will order a versatile antitank/battlefield version, 
said Mr. Bigay. 
  In terms of exports, Eurocopter is counting on a British 
order of 91 Tigers, on which London plans to announce its 
decision in May of 1995. In addition, the joint venture firm has 
just begun studying another versatile, cheaper Tiger version, 
which it plans to export beginning in 1998, notably (it hopes) 
to the Netherlands.

  [Text] Stockholm--Saab Aircraft AB announced 17 January in 
Linkoeping that its new, radar-carrying Saab-340-AEW had made 
its first test flight, which lasted two hours. 
  The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model, 
which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab-340 
type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900-kg radar made by 
the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics. 
  The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary 
electrical power system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply 
the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its 
computers. 
  Sweden's Defense Equipment Office (FMV) ordered six of the 
aircraft for surveillance of national land and sea territory. A 
spokesperson for Saab Aircraft AB said that construction of the 
craft, excluding radar, would cost just over 500 million Swedish 
crowns (a little over 365 million French francs [Fr], give or 
take). 
  The new Saab-340-AEW, which the British have nicknamed "the 
poor man's AWAC", has attracted the notice of international 
specialists. This, says the company spokesperson, "is a very 
good sign for future exports." The first AEW will be delivered 
to Sweden's defense forces during the first quarter of 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Buerke: "Light Purifies Water -- </F>
UV-Lamps Can Be an Alternative to Chlorine -- Pilot Plant 
Planned Near Bonn"] 
  [Text] Mankind has been able to control a number of 
epidemic diseases, such as cholera, by disinfecting drinking 
water. Chlorine has been the main agent used for this purpose 
for about 100 years. In the more recent past, however, 
scientists have acknowledged that these additives also give rise 
to the formation of a number of harmful by-products, such as 
chloroform. This was why the Federal Research Minister set up a 
joint research project six years ago to examine the feasibility 
of using ultraviolet light to disinfect drinking water, for 
which it provided total funding in excess of 6 million German 
marks. Not long ago, the multidisciplinary research team 
demonstrated that plants of this type can be built on an 
industrial scale as well. 
  Actually, there have been UV disinfecting plants since the 
beginning of the century, though only for fairly small 
throughputs and primarily for use with well or spring water, 
which is relatively untainted. The multiyear studies set out to 
create the technical prerequisites for an industrial-scale plant 
capable of purifying large volumes of water from lakes and 
reservoirs, where the main problem is biological contamination 
caused by plankton, which constitutes organic matter that 
subsequently reacts with chlorine to form harmful substances. 
  The test system was built by scientists at the Max Planck 
Institute of Radiation Chemistry in Muelheim. It basically 
comprises a UV lamp similar in shape and size to a neon tube, 
which is inserted into a stainless steel pipe. The water flows 
through the space between the lamp and the inner wall of the 
pipe, where it is exposed to UV radiation. 
  The researchers optimized their plant over long series of 
tests until it was possible to kill off sufficient quantities of 
the main bacteria and viruses. An important condition for 
success in this respect is that all the water in the flow pipe 
must be evenly exposed to uniform radiation. Moreover, 
researchers from the Free University of Berlin Hygiene Institute 
have also established that no substances that could have a 
mutagenic effect on human beings occur in UV-treated water. 
  Nevertheless, technical limitations also emerged. For 
example, if the water has too high an iron or manganese content, 
radiation precipitates these elements, which then form a thin 
film on the glass wall of the lamp. In extreme cases this 
halves the intensity of the radiation after only 500 operating 
hours. Care is also needed when treating water with a high 
nitrate content, as toxic nitrite can be formed. However, this 
problem can be avoided by using a special UV lamp in such cases. 
  A general drawback is that -- unlike the procedure used with 
chemical additives -- the water is, of course, not further 
disinfected in the mains after radiation, so it is possible that 
germs may re-form there. It still has to be established whether 
recontamination of this type occurs or not. 
  Be that as it may, in certain conditions the UV method 
constitutes an alternative to chemical disinfection. A pilot 
plant will thus be set up at the Wahnbach reservoir, whose 
waters supply about three-quarters of a million people in the 
Bonn area with drinking water.

Waste Gases"] 
  [Text] The TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied 
Natural Science Research] has developed a membrane absorber 
which removes 95 percent of the sulphur dioxide from waste 
gases, as became clear from tests in the potato flour plant 
Avebe. The collected sulphur dioxide can be recycled. A 
membrane absorber is a device which brings gas in contact with 
fluid. It consists of a series of hollow fiber membranes, 
through which a fluid passes. The noxious fumes flow on the 
surface of the fibers, with some being absorbed by the fluid. In 
the membrane absorber, the stream of fumes is crosswise to the 
stream of fluid. The advantage of this is that the reduction of 
pressure is small and the unwanted oxidation of sulphite to 
sulphate is low.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Speed Sorter for Plastic </F>
Parts"] 
  [Text] A consortium of European companies and research 
organisations has won a research contract worth nearly Ecu 1.5m 
from the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) to develop 
a system for the identification and separation of plastics in 
mixed waste. The consortium's proposal -- submitted under the 
CEC's Brite-Euram Industrial and Materials Technologies 
Programme -- was awarded an A1 (outstanding) assessment in 
competition with over 1,250 proposals. 
  The proposed system has major implications for the 
efficiency 
and cost effectiveness of recycling plastics by detecting 
specially developed 'tracers' added in minute quantities to the 
various plastics used by the packaging, automotive and other 
industries. The tracers will be detected by an advanced device 
using the latest fluorosensor technology. 
  One benefit of the system is that it is able not only to 
detect different generic plastics but also to segregate 
different grades of the same material. The potential for 
identifying and separating a wide range of different plastics 
types and grades is virtually unlimited. 
  The system is unique in being able to identify plastics 
containing black and other strongly absorbing colours. It is 
also able to operate with materials which are surface 
contaminated, the system will also be able to identify and 
reject specific unwanted materials. 
  A product of the contract will be a pilot sorting machine; 
this will be capable of making at least 100 identifications and 
of sorting plastics at speeds of at least 10 articles/s. 
Proving trials will take place at a waste management site. 
  The consortium comprises: Pira International, UK -- lead 
contractor and project co-ordinator; Bayer AG, Germany -- will 
develop fluorescent tracers under its own patent; Cranfield 
University (RMCS), UK -- will develop a sensitive detection 
system using fluorosensor technology; Newell Engineering, UK -- 
will create handling systems for high speed segregation of 
plastics articles and construct a pilot sorting machine; APME, 
Technical and Environment Centre (formerly PWMI), Belgium -- 
responsible for proving the processability of the tracers and 
the conversion of plastic containing them into three dimensional 
articles; and Laboratoire National d'Essais France -- 
responsible for checking the stability of the tracer/polymer 
systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Bart Stam: "Heemstede Is Experimental Garden For </F>
Biological Water Purification"] 
  [Text] Heemstede -- After three years' research, the 
Hoogheem council of the Rijnland area regards the time ripe for 
the introduction of a new water purification technology. This 
will take place in Heemstede, where phosphates will be removed 
from the water using a combination of biological 
dephosphatization and a granular reactor. The equipment will 
cost 7 million guilders to install. 
  The Heemstede Water Purification Plant (AWZI) is a 
demonstration model. Should the test unit meet expectations, 
then the Hoogheem council is considering building more of these 
dephosphatization plants. "That depends on the experience we 
build up in Heemstede over the coming year," says P. Knaapen, 
head of Rijnland's purification technique department in Leiden. 
"We are checking whether it meets expectations with regard to 
phosphate purification. And we are also taking account of 
aspects like control, maintenance and the definitive size." The 
Heemstede unit is based on a scale model which Rijnland has 
tested since 1990 in three water purification plants. This 
mini-plant can be transported in a container. In 
Zuid-Kennemerland it is the first time that the purification 
method will be used at real size. 
<H5>  Algae Growth </H5>
  When phosphates enter water, they cause an increase in the 
number of nutrients in the water (eutrophication). This in turn 
causes a massive growth in algae, so that the amount of oxygen 
in the water declines. The main sources of phosphates in water 
are households (kitchen waste and feces) and agriculture 
(fertilizers). The contribution caused by washing powders is 
declining because many manufacturers have switched to 
phosphate-free products. 
  The AWZI in Heemstede already had a biological purification 
process. However, the equipment to remove the phosphate from 
the mass of bacteria -- the purification sediment -- is a new 
element. Its main advantage is that it does not increase the 
quantity of purification sediment. When oxygen is added, the 
micro-organisms absorb the phosphates. Rijnland continually 
separates off part of the sediment and adds acetic acid. While 
the bacteria absorb the acid as nutrients, they give off the 
phosphate again. This leads to water which is rich in 
phosphates and sediment which contains virtually none. 
  The next step is separating sediment and water. The Hoogheem 
council has chosen a centrifuge to do this. After the 
separation process, the sediment returns to its own purification 
process to once again absorb phosphates. At this stage the 
effluent contains virtually no phosphates. On the other hand 
the phosphate-rich water from the centrifuge must undergo two 
more processing stages. 
  The first processing stage is the addition of sulfuric acid 
to the water. This removes the carbonate from the water. This 
is necessary because this substance can block the following 
phase of the process, the granular reactor. The granular 
reactor was developed by the DHV engineering company in 
Amersfoort and enjoys an international reputation. 
<H5>  Large Granules </H5>
  Once the water has been pumped into the granular reactor, 
limewater is added to the centrifuge effluent. A deposit of 
calcium phosphate then forms from the limemilk and phosphate. 
The water goes from the bottom to the top of the reactor 
several times. The granular reactor contains grafting sand. 
The calcium phosphate attaches itself to the grafting sand and 
forms phosphate granules. The result is obvious: The granules 
become bigger and eventually drop to the bottom due to their 
weight. Here they are removed. The purified water is returned 
to the oxygenation tank. 
  The AWZI in Heemstede is one of 45 water purification plants 
in Rijnland. The aim of the plant is to help the Hoogheem 
council in the fight against phosphate. Rijnland calculates 
that in 1995 it will have to process some 900 tonnes of 
phosphates. This figure is based on the assumption that there 
are no increases in phosphate use.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: "The Problem Of </F>
`Biodegradability'. Materials And The Environment."] 
  [Text] An increasing awareness of the environment has 
resulted in research being instigated into new and 
environmentally friendly materials, such as biodegradable 
plastics. Initially the creation of these biopolymers was held 
up by various different problems, but at the same time essential 
basic knowledge was being acquired and the `biodegradable' 
phenomenon has recently been defined in a better way than ever 
before. In other words, biopolymers are well on the way to full 
development. 
  In the meantime, various `biodegradable' plastics have 
appeared on the market which have been evaluated too light, such 
as those mixtures which were often blends of polyethylene and 
modified starch. They were sold under the principle of 
environmental friendliness, but in fact they were worse than 
traditional plastics. Micro organisms only break down the starch 
component, while the polyethylene fragments are diffused 
directly into the environment. There they are digested by birds, 
which are often unable to survive such a diet. All of this has 
done perception of the environmental character of biological 
plastics no good at all. 
  "It has been a very good learning experience," said Dr. Bert 
Tournois, divisional head of the Agrotechnological Research 
Center, ATO, in Wageningen. "If a plastic is being marketed as 
biodegradable, then the polymer really does have to be 
biodegradable." According to Tournois, this means that it is 
highly necessary to be able to define biodegradability in one 
way or another. That, therefore, has been one of the subjects 
into which ATO has been carrying out research. 
<H5>  Biological Breakdown Test </H5>
  ATO-DLO [Agrotechnological Research Center - Division 
Agricultural Research] has been very involved over the last few 
years researching pure biopolymers, particularly in connection 
with modified starch. In the first instance, the relationship 
was examined between a specific modification to the starch 
molecule and the final quality of the plastic. This research is 
progressing well, and ATO now has at its disposal a form of 
structural properties sample card. The result is that by means 
of specifically aimed modifications in the structure of the 
starch polymers, the properties of the bioplastic can be chosen 
very precisely. This involves characteristics such as 
brittleness, strength, elasticity, water attraction and 
repelling features, and so on. According to Tournois, "One of 
the most important properties in these new materials is, of 
course, their biodegradability, and this property had in fact 
not been properly defined until recently. A great deal of 
progress has been achieved in this field in recent years." 
  ATO has developed a number of tests in which the biological 
breakdown can be determined, a package which is not only 
applicable to bioplastics but is also of interest for a wide 
group of materials, ranging from paper and wood to adhesives, 
rubbers, and coatings. A biological breakdown test for solid 
components appears, in fact, to have been a gap in the market. 
Until recently there had been standardized methods for liquid 
waste matter, but not for solid materials. Above all, what 
exactly is `biodegradability'? 
  As Tournois explains, "If something dissolves, it doesn't 
necessarily mean that it is also biodegradable. The easy 
tendency is to say that biopolymers have been biologically 
broken down when you can no longer see them. That is not the 
case. We feel that the biological breakdown needs to be 
described as a chemical change which is initiated by a 
biological activity." 
<H5>  Breakthrough </H5>
  ATO has therefore made an inventory of the tests which 
existed previously, and afterwards started considering what a 
standard test for bio-destruction should be like. In particular 
they have sought contact with standardization bodies such as the 
European CEN [European Committee for Standardization], and the 
Dutch Standardization Institute, NNI. These efforts have led to 
a number of standardization tests for four different features: 
anaerobic or aerobic, wet or dry. ATO has in the meantime made 
these tests commercially available, and according to Tournois 
there is great interest, not surprisingly. Following the 
problems that occurred with the first so-called `biodegradable' 
blends, it is now of vital importance that the term should be 
given real meaning. Using a standardized test, business, 
industry, and materials developers will be able to work out how 
their new product can be broken down by micro organisms, even 
under which circumstances and within what time scale. A 
breakthrough, Tournois feels. 
<H5>  Outstrip </H5>
  The perception of the relationships between structure and 
properties, and the development of a standardized biological 
breakdown test, have brought the introduction of more and 
improved bioplastics closer. That means, however, that research 
into polymers is still moving rapidly. In fact the biopolymer 
technicians are rapidly overtaking the petrochemical polymer 
technology. Whereas the conventional plastics industry can rely 
on more than 40 years' experience, the bioplastics industry is 
still at the crawling stage. However, the catching up is taking 
place very fast indeed, not in the least because much of the 
groundwork has already been covered by the petrochemical 
industry. Meanwhile, various bioplastics have been developed, 
such as [polyhydroxyalkanoaten] polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA's), 
of which polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most well known. 
They are produced by micro organisms which store the polymers 
in the shape of little balls within the cell. By adapting the 
process and by choosing a specialized breeding ground, it 
appears to be possible to let bacteria produce certain PHA's 
more or less `on measure'. These so-called fermentation 
polymers are still very expensive, despite the fact that the 
price per kilo has dropped over the last few years from about 60 
Dutch guilders to around 10 guilders. 
  Another category covers polylactids or polylactic acids. 
Initially this advanced degradable plastic seemed to be far too 
expensive, and it was used primarily for medical applications, 
such as surgical stitching thread. It now seems possible to 
produce it at a much cheaper price, by withdrawing the lactic 
acid raw material not from sugar, but for instance to prepare it 
from potato waste or from whey. A further cost reduction 
appears possible as a result of increasing the production 
capacity. In the meantime there are a number of relatively 
large installations in operation in the United States and Japan 
(see POLYTECHNISCH WEEKBLAD Number 45, 1992). Such 
installations can now produce the polymers for approximately 
five guilders per kilo. Protein plastics, such as gluten, can 
cost even less and the same applies to modified starch polymers, 
the price of which is expected to be not much more than that of 
polyethylene. 
<H5>  Biopolymer Center </H5>
  The biopolymer industry is at the starting line and the 
first 
products are already on the market, such as shampoo bottles made 
from PHB and French fries bags created from modified starch. On 
the research front, too, work is being done on biopolymers, for 
instance at the Universities of Twente, Leiden, Utrecht, 
Groningen, Eindhoven's Technical University, and naturally in 
the research institutes, not least at ATO-DLO in Wageningen. 
  Recently an official center for biopolymers was set up at 
ATO, where centralized research is being carried out into some 
eight or nine different biopolymer types. It is a relatively 
large and excellently equipped center, in which around 60 
researchers will be working. The new center is not intended to 
remain a purely national concern. According to ATO, the 
institute must achieve international status.

  [Text] All over the world, great efforts are being made in 
various directions to make wider use of solar power. In 
addition to solar heat collectors, which are primarily used to 
heat water, solar cells also make it possible to generate 
electrical current directly from sunlight (photovoltaics). 
Photovoltaics is already being widely used to generate 
electricity in remote areas and for small-scale applications in 
appliances. Photovoltaics is also being used in numerous 
demonstration plants in conjunction with mains electricity. The 
electricity from main-connected photovoltaic systems still costs 
about 10 times as much as conventionally generated mains 
electricity. Of the several approaches being explored in an 
attempt to lower the cost of photovoltaics, it is considered 
that the scientific quest for more effective solar cell 
materials and the development of cheaper production methods hold 
out the best prospects. High-absorption thin-film solar cells 
and novel production processes involving cost-saving material 
deposition onto a substrate take on particular significance in 
this respect. The Berlin-based Hahn-Meitner Institute, working 
with the University of Stuttgart's Institute of Physical 
Electronics, has recently achieved a significant improvement in 
efficiency in a thin-film solar cell made of copper, indium, and 
sulfur. This sulfurous material is largely 
environment-compatible. The efficiency of this novel solar cell 
was raised to 10.2 percent -- in natural daylight and without 
further optimization in the form of, for example, an 
antireflection coating. 
  This material's theoretical efficiency exceeds the maximum 
performance of silicon. The thickness of the absorber layer, 
which has a direct bearing on production costs, needs to be only 
three-thousandths of a millimeter, so copper-indium disulfide 
has great development potential. It was possible to raise the 
degree of efficiency in the new cells because the vapor 
deposition process produces copper-rich photoactive material 
with a high sulfur surplus. An improved "window material" used 
as a transparent, conductive contact layer also contributed to 
this positive result.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "Lotem Studies the Conductibility of </F>
Geological Layers"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Lotem is the name of a geophysical method 
to detect petroleum and natural gas deposits, by studying the 
property of conducting electricity of geological strata. As 
reported by Dr. Andreas Hoerdt at the Institute for Geophysics 
of Cologne University (Albert-Magnus-Platz, Cologne), the Lotem 
method is cheaper, and in some cases also more precise, than 
conventional prospecting methods. 
  When a region is to be studied for potential deposits of 
hydrocarbons, a cable approximately one kilometer in length is 
first stretched over the search area. The cable is grounded by 
two electrode plates at the ends. If a current of between 20 and 
100 amperes is now sent through the cable, it becomes a 
transmitter of electromagnetic waves. The waves penetrate into 
the ground to be studied. 
  The direction of the current is reversed at certain 
intervals, which produces induction currents in the ground. 
These currents now persist longer the better the electrical 
conductibility of the layer in question. The induction currents 
produce an electrical and magnetic field, which can be measured 
at the surface. 
  The measurement instruments are induction coils or copper 
sulfate electrodes, which function as receivers. When measuring 
the terrain the transmitting cable remains in the same place; 
only the receiving equipment is moved. This way a cutaway view 
of the geological formation of the underground can be obtained. 
  In the context of oil exploration, the profile can then be 
used for, among other things, determining the most suitable site 
for test drilling. Financially, this is a big help, since test 
drilling is expensive. At present, a five-kilometer-deep bore 
hole costs about 20 million German marks [DM]. 
  Lotem has already been successfully tested by Cologne 
University both in Germany and within the framework of a BMFT 
[Federal Ministry for Research and Technology] project in China 
and India. The display of the geological profile was recently 
made even more graphic by using the current-image interpretation 
method. With this method the specific electrical resistance of a 
layer is visualized directly in the form of various colors or 
gray levels. 
  Although Lotem is relatively inexpensive compared to 
conventional methods of prospecting, such as seismic 
prospecting, its application is still limited. This is due to 
the low resolution of the procedure. Complicated faults cannot 
yet be measured. 
  On the other hand, Lotem can very well distinguish between 
water and oil-bearing strata, which is not possible with seismic 
methods. Furthermore, Lotem is not hindered by volcanic rock 
covers, which transmit electromagnetic but not sound waves.

  [Text] 
  In the new version of the Packaging Ordinance, the Federal 
Minister for the Environment, Klaus Topfer, is backing quota 
measures. Chairman of the VKE, Dr. Albrecht Eckell, says, "By 
1998, capacities of 700,000 metric tons per annum and more will 
be ready." 
  In the case of returnable packages, plastics are already on 
the offensive in the Federal German packaging market, according 
to Dr. Bernd Hallier. He is the director of the 
Euro-Handelsinstitut in Cologne. In the case of non-returnable 
packages on the other hand, he says that plastics are still on 
the defensive. The reason for this is the recycling crisis into 
which the plastic branch has slid since the Packaging Ordinance 
became law. This is because the increase in capacity for 
material utilization of plastics has not yet been able to keep 
up with the rapidly growing amounts collected by the Dual System 
Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. However, this situation will change 
soon. Dr. Albrecht Eckell predicted on 30 November at the 
"Plastics + Environment" symposium in Cologne that, "Just using 
raw-material recycling, the plastic utilization problem will be 
solved by 1998." He is the chairman of the Association of 
Plastics Producing Industries (VKE) in Frankfurt. Starting by 
the end of 1997, he claims that in Germany, recycling capacities 
on the order of magnitude of 700,000 metric tons per year and 
more will be available. 
  In spite of this, Dr. Albrecht Eckell welcomes the current 
political consideration being given to the Packaging Ordinance 
and the acceptance of raw-material recycling (in the form of 
chemical preparation methods) as material reuse provided in the 
draft amendment. This is because a fifty-fifty division of the 
discussed new utilization quota (60% instead of the 
previous 
64%) between processed-material recycling (plastic remains 
plastic) and raw-material recycling (plastic becomes 
petrochemical raw material) is still not sufficient in the 
opinion of Dr. Johannes Brandrup, the director responsible in 
his association for environmental interests. For reasons of 
quality, only 10% to 20% of the recycled processed 
material 
may be accessible over the long term. Reutilization on a large 
scale, on the other hand, is provided by the raw material method. 
  Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer is the Federal Minister for the 
Environment. In an amendment to the Packaging Ordinance, he 
wants to see the pressure maintained on the industry by means of 
a specific quota for processed-material recycling. Corresponding 
technologies that are just starting in the small-business arena 
should not be allowed to wither because of a lack of critical 
mass. "Where we set bottlenecks in a market economy, the 
reaction is not resignation but rather technical progress." 
Virtually no packaging has remained unchanged for example as a 
result of the Ordinance -- with a corresponding reduction in the 
packaging volume. Even the DSD has struck a resounding chord 
with the people. The bottleneck in utilizing sales packages is 
not demonstrated in collecting nor in sorting but in material 
utilization. However, it could scarcely be expected that 
appropriate capacities for reutilization would be built before 
the corresponding quantities of material were available. 
  According to Topfer, "For me, the question in amending the 
Packaging Ordinance is, what is utilization? For this reason, in 
the future, we will not only observe and make possible 
processed-material recycling but also raw-material recycling in 
all possible facets. We are assuming that both sub-areas will 
achieve a recycling quota of 60% by 1998 and want to 
specify 
this quota in the amended Ordinance." 
  In the words of the Federal Minister for the Environment, 
everything exceeding these figures not only can be sent to a 
thermal utilization process but must be sent there. Says Topfer, 
"No one can explain to me why it is that we mine brown coal from 
the earth using open-pit mining, burn this coal for power and 
heat and then fill the holes we have made by mining with 
domestic trash when the domestic trash has a higher heating 
value than the brown coal."

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "More Effective Waste Water Treatment With </F>
the Biogas Tower Reactor"] 
  [Text] Anaerobic biotechnical waste water treatment in 
bioreactors is today already being used by the food industry, 
pulp production and paper manufacturing companies. The field of 
bioprocessing technology at the Hamburg-Harburg Technical 
University (Professor Herbert Maerkl, Denickestrasse 15, 21071, 
Hamburg) has now, in cooperation with Preussag Noell 
Wassertechnik GmbH, developed a new type of bioreactor concept 
for increasing the decomposition effects. 
  As reported by Maerkl, anaerobic biotechnical cleaning 
methods are generally held to be less effective than aerobic 
ones. This is due to the slow rate of growth of the anaerobic 
microorganisms. However, the decomposition effects per gram of 
biomass are comparable to those of aerobic microbes. For that 
reason, if it is possible to increase the biomass in the 
reactor, anaerobic methods are also very effective. This 
increase has been achieved with the biogas tower reactor from 
Hamburg by using the sludge bed process. Another problem with 
anaerobic bioreactors is transferring the generated biogas to 
the outside. Gas production can be so high that disposal is 
impossible to deal with or would lead to a loss of biomass 
through flotation. This problem is also solved by the tower 
reactor. Gas suction equipment has been built into the reactor 
container at various heights. This makes it possible to dispose 
of gas even at low levels. Technically, the suction equipment 
works by adding pockets in the form of sloping metal sheets in 
the reactor volume. They partition the reactor into several 
compartments connected with each other and catch the rising 
biogas. The gas bubble formed under the sheet can be drawn off 
through a vent placed there. By regulating the gas extraction at 
the various heights, it is possible to regulate the gas content 
so as to be uniform throughout the reactor. But the gas bubble 
under the pockets has other advantages as well. By means of the 
free surfaces formed on the liquid, floating biomass particles 
are also kept down. Therefore, the gas extraction is possible 
without loss of biomass. The pockets can also help when mixing 
the reactor content. It is important for the decomposition 
effect that the microorganisms and the added waste water are as 
evenly distributed as possible. Since some microbes live in the 
form of symbiotic agglomerates, this blending must have as 
little gravitational force as possible. This problem is 
elegantly solved in the biogas tower reactor. 
  If the gas under the pockets is not removed, it continues to 
rise upward over an overflow edge. Through built-in flow 
channels this creates a circulating flow in the liquid. It can 
be controlled by the level of gas removal. In this way various 
blending intensities can be regulated in the various 
compartments of the reactor. The requirement to achieve good 
blending in the lower reactor areas and a high storage capacity 
for the biomass in the higher areas is easily met. By properly 
regulating the blending, the inhibiting effect of hydrogen 
sulfide, which is created from sulfate in the waste water, can 
also be reduced. 
  At this time a 20-meter-high reactor with a diameter of one 
meter is being operated as a pilot facility. It has turned out 
to be successful in treating yeast waste water.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Rhone-Poulenc Is Considering Different </F>
Rare Earths Production Methods to Solve Waste Problems"] 
  [Text] Paris--Rhone-Poulenc announced on 6 December that it 
is considering producing its rare earths from bastnaesite, an 
ore purchased and preprocessed in China and the United States, 
instead of the monazite presently imported from Australia and 
whose residues create storage problems. 
  The fabrication of rare earths (15 chemical elements) from 
monazite generates residues with low radioactivity. This waste 
has been stored for the past twenty years at a specialized site 
in the Manche, but it reached saturation capacity in 1991 and 
Rhone-Poulenc had three years to find another solution. 
  The chemical group had considered storing the waste at the 
site of a former uranium extracting plant at Ecarpiere (Vendee), 
which raised strong local opposition. Lacking authorization for 
this site, and with "no storage solution found at the national 
level," Rhone-Poulenc is thinking about simply switching to 
bastnaesite for its supply. 
  This substitution implies shutting down the ore 
preprocessing 
plant at La Rochelle (Charente-Maritime) in September 1994, 
involving 65 jobs out of a plant total of 500. The decision 
however is not expected to cause any job losses as the employees 
will be reassigned at the site. 
  Rhone-Poulenc is the world's main producer of extracted rare 
earths, with 20 percent of the world's volume (36 percent in 
terms of value), ahead of the American Molycorp, the Japanese 
Santoku and Chinese manufacturers. The group notably holds 65 
percent of the world market for rare earths used in catalytic 
converters for automobiles. Rare earths are also used in 
luminescent applications (notably television screens), 
electronics, and magnetic applications (audio recording heads, 
magnets, scanners), and optics.

<F P=106> [Article by Scha: "Progress in Biological Plant Protection; </F>
Ciba-Geigy Brings Two New Biological Products to Market"] 
  [Text] Bielefeld--The use of biological plant protectants 
is today still subject to many limitations. Their production is 
mainly labor-intensive and costly, their storability often very 
short, delivering them to the plants is also labor-intensive and 
costly, their effectiveness often limited, and the user has to 
be very knowledgable about them. Ciba-Geigy, which claims to be 
the leading firm in the plant protection market, has now 
introduced the first bioproducts ready for marketing in Germany 
to control pests and diseases biologically in commercial 
horticulture and tree nurseries which, according to Jakob 
Brassel, the director of the Ciba department for research and 
development on biological plant protection, signify a 
breakthrough in this sector. Whereas up to now biological 
control agents have accounted for only 1.5 percent of all 
pesticides worldwide, this percentage is expected to grow to 5 
percent by the year 2000. By then Ciba wants to have developed a 
product line of biological pest and disease-control agents. 
  Based on live elvers (nematodes), the bioproducts "Exhibit 
F27" and "Exhibit G25" that have now been introduced will be 
used in the cultivation of ornamental plants to control the 
larvae of small gnats [Lycoriidae] or of the dreaded 
Dickmaulruessler [a type of insect pest]. In 1992 Ciba concluded 
a worldwide developement and marketing agreement for 
nematode-based products with the American firm Biosys in Palo 
Alto, California, and it possesses the marketing rights for the 
whole world, with the exception of Japan. The nematodes are 
produced in the trillions in biofermenters, emptied into fabric 
hoses pervious to air, and in the process embedded in a natural, 
viscous biopolymer. The practical apportionment of 5 million 
units allows for a dosage that matches production with demand, 
even over smaller areas. The bioproducts are closely bound to 
the insect larvae to produce specific effects and are therefore 
absolutely compatible with plants and the environment. 
  In connection with this, Ciba-Geigy stresses the fact that 
chemical plant protection will also be essential in future to 
ensure profits, especially with big crops like, for example, 
wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. But in terms of 
integrated plant protection, the combination of biological and 
chemical agents is gaining in importance. Approaches involving 
genetic engineering may also offer ways of solving the problem.

  A company, declared dead in 1991, sparkles with innovative 
systems for soil restoration. The Trust Agency had already 
written them off. "Incapable of reorganization," was the 
assessment of the privatization agency of Berlin in May 1991. 
They made a fundamental error. 
  For a long time, the Samag Maschinenfabrik Sangerhausen 
GmbH, 
located on the southeast edge of the Harz Mountains in 
Saxony-Anhalt, has been making hefty profits. This year, the 
profit is expected to be five million marks. By the end of next 
year, the company will employ 1,400 people -- 100 more than 
before the unification. At this time, it employs 1,150. In 1995, 
it plans on moving onto the stock market. 
  Rescue came in the form of the South Tyrolean industrial 
scion Kurt Mayer, 50, who took over the operation two years ago. 
Using sugar production systems, the professional in barter trade 
first pepped up the regular Eastern European customers who had 
broken away. The people from Sangerhausen supplied centrifuges 
and pulp presses. The customers, Russians and Ukrainians, paid 
with oil, high-grade steel, and sugar. 
  With part of the proceeds from this barter, the 
white-bearded, shaggy-haired dynamic individual with the baroque 
figure expanded environmental engineering "to the second pillar" 
of the company. Mayer calls it "a gigantic growth market." In 
the meantime, systems for sewage sludge disposal and sewage and 
effluent handling make up one third of production. 
  The people from Sangerhausen want to turn a hefty profit. 
They have more than tripled their revenue from 1991 to about 200 
million marks today, primarily with a newly developed recycling 
system that detoxifies soil, slags and building rubble. A lot of 
contracts are beckoning. 
  At the end of October, Federal Minister for the Environment 
Klaus Topfer presented the draft for the soil conservation law. 
This law would obligate the party responsible to eliminate 
hazardous waste from the past. The Federal Environmental Office 
in Berlin estimates that the restoration of about 240,000 
locations suspected of containing hazardous waste from the past 
in Germany will consume up to 390 billion marks. Of these 
locations, 80,000 are in the New Lands. 
  The Samag engineers are particularly proud of the fact that 
in their washing method, no residue remains that must be placed 
in a landfill. The dissolved pollutants which, at the end, 
adhere to tiny grains of earth and stone, are sealed. In 
technical language, they are immobilized. This happens, for 
example, by adding insoluble phosphates into the wash water. The 
encapsulation is so dead-certain, swear the engineers, that even 
acid rain could not rinse the poisons out in a thousand years. 
  The immobilized granulate can then be used as building 
material for example for curb stones and noise abatement walls 
or it can be mixed with gravel. "With the hundred percent reuse, 
we are ahead of the competition by a nose," says Mayer joyfully. 
  There is something to this. In the high-pressure soil 
washing 
system of Klockner Oecotec GmbH in Duisburg, one of the market 
leaders in Germany in cleaning contaminated soils, after washing 
1000 metric tons of contaminated earth, 100 metric tons still 
end up in landfills for hazardous waste. "We must reduce this 
amount," promises the marketing director Winfried Brull. 
Immobilization such as that practiced by the people from 
Sangerhausen is one conceivable method. 
  The Samag tinkerers also view themselves as having an 
advantage over thermal methods of soil cleansing such as that 
offered by Ruhrkohle Umwelttechnik GmbH (Rut) in Bottrop. This 
is because incineration only renders organic pollutants harmless 
but not heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury. 
  Decontamination costs 250 to 800 marks per metric ton, 
depending upon the degree of contamination. This amount is about 
the same for Samag and its competitor Oecotec. To protect the 
procedure against imitators, the people from Sangerhausen 
operate their mobile recycling system which, depending upon the 
design, can cost between 25 and 32 million marks, "in principle 
by ourselves," says Mayer. The 40 to 60 modules are built in at 
most four weeks on location, assured Rainer Sonnenberger, 
director of environmental engineering at Samag. 
  The system passed its baptism by fire in Wolfen near 
Bitterfeld. There, under contract to the Trust Agency, they are 
cleaning up to 1000 metric tons of building rubble daily from 
demolished buildings of the Orwo film factory. Hot steam and 
water, mixed with lyes and surface-active agents, dissolve heavy 
metals and acids from the heavily contaminated rocks in several 
washing stages. Finally an attrition mill, a type of vibrating 
machine, rubs particularly difficult toxic substances from the 
fine-grained debris left after passing through sieves several 
times. The toxic water in the closed circuit of the system is 
extensively cleaned again and again. 
  "The system can be easily modified so that it cleans every 
contaminated material optimally," enthuses the Samag boss Mayer. 
The necessary analyses come from their own laboratories. 
  After Christmas, a second recycling system will start 
operation on the ground of Chemie AG in Bitterfeld. This system 
is to decontaminate the soils, building rubble and industrial 
sludge of the former chemical combine. In addition, there are 
four orders from Italy, one from New York, and two from the New 
Lands. 
  Precisely there is where the business is particularly 
difficult, complains Mayer. "East Germans still have a very low 
opinion of East Germans." Even worse, the old boys' network 
makes sure somebody in the network gets the lucrative contracts 
for restoration of hazardous waste from the past. According to 
Mayer, "We have to fight with a knife between our teeth." 
  The go-getting entrepreneur also had trouble with the 
chairman of the board of the Wolfen Vermogensverwaltung AG 
(WVV), Rolf Rattunde, who was placed in that position by the 
Trust Agency. Mayer wants to create three new operation with 450 
jobs on some of the land of the Orwo film factory that he has 
restored: 


    -  a precast concrete form factory in which the 
immobilized granulate from the recycling systems is to be reused, 
  -  a system for solvent recover from the Orwo film production, 
  -  a system to obtain biological diesel from the sewage sludge 
and 
rape. 

    However, Rattunde has been dragging his feet for five months 
over the sale of the necessary land, grumbles Mayer. However, 
such objections cannot turn the steadfast South Tyrolean from 
his expansion plans. Mayer is not going to make the same error 
committed by many eastern companies that fired research and 
development personnel by the dozens. "Only with innovative 
marketable products will we be able to stand on our own two feet 
again," he recognized early on. He employed 62 engineers, 
brought experts from Italy and the Czech Republic. To obtain the 
best know-how fast, he hired scientists from the universities in 
Tubingen, Milan, Graz, and Berlin. In the next year, Mayer will 
put another 20 million marks into research. 
  The investments are bearing fruit. The Samag boss firmly 
expects acceptance of the bid for renaturation of the Silbersee 
near Wolfen that was completely contaminated by the sewage and 
effluent from the nearby Orwo film factory. With a water 
purification method, Mayer will restore the sewer for 80 million 
marks and, so he promises, "make the lake odorless." He has 
spent 2.5 million marks on the development of this water 
purification method. 
  The people from Sangerhausen have proven that the method 
works using a demonstration system. They have pumped large 
quantities of air into the lake through hoses. The oxygen 
contained in this air activated bacteria that ecologically 
annihilate the stinking sulfur gases rising from the sludge 
layer at the bottom of the lake. 
  Actually, the decision regarding restoration of the 
Silbersee 
should have been made at the beginning of December. However, the 
fall of the government of Saxony-Anhalt stopped the project. 
Temporarily, Mayer believes, who would rather look toward the 
future. "If we succeed with the Silbersee trial, millions of 
marks in business beckon us in restoring dead waters."

<F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "The Forest is Left Standing in </F>
the Acid Rain"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Research Has Not Been Able to Explain the Processes of 
Forest Decline </H3>
  The State of the Forests Report from the Federal Government 
does not contain much new information this year -- two of three 
trees in Germany continue to be sick. Ten years of research into 
forest damage have not yielded any strategies for stemming the 
tide of damage. In addition, criticism of the methods for 
surveying the damage is growing. 
  To summarize the results of the new damage survey, the State 
of the Forests Report needed only one short page. According to 
this report, 24% of the trees in Germany show clear 
damage, 
40% show slight damage, and 36% show no signs of 
damage. The 
forest in northwest Germany is relatively well off. In this 
area, the portion of trees showing clear damage is 16% on 
average. In southern Germany on the other hand, every fourth 
tree shows clear damage. In the new Federal Lands, this figure 
is 29%. In Thuringia, every second tree is dying. 
Different 
types of trees react differently. One fifth of both the spruces 
and pines show clear damage. However, this is the case with 
45% 
of the oaks and 32% of the beeches. 
  The data show little that is new. The rates in the 
individual 
damage stages have changed little since 1991. Accordingly, 
2% 
to 2.5% of the trees have lost at least 61% of 
their needles 
or leaves (damage stage 3) or have already died (damage stage 
4). Also, 22% to 25% exhibit needle or leave 
losses of 26 to 
60% (damage stage 2), 40% still have at least 
three quarters 
of their original needle or leave mass (damage stage 1), and 32 
to 36% have been declared healthy because they have lost a 
maximum of 10% of their needles or leaves. "The forest 
continues to be in a difficult situation," comments Jochen 
Borchert. He is the Federal Minister for Agriculture and said 
this during the presentation of the report at the beginning of 
December in Bonn. "However, we are not ready to ring the 
disaster alarm." 
  Indeed, sick trees do not frighten anyone any more. One 
reason is that the forest is dying more slowly than believed ten 
years ago. The chronology since 1984 shows that, in northwest 
Germany (former Federal Lands), the rate of trees "showing clear 
damage" (damage stages 2 to 4) increased from 10% to 
16% by 
1993. The rate of "healthy" trees (damage stage 0) dropped from 
62% to 50% in the same time. In southern Germany, 
the portion 
of sick trees increased from 20 to 25%, the portion of 
"healthy" trees fell from 45 to 33%. 
  For the survey, the individual Lands first covered their 
forest areas with a grid. Depending upon the size of the forest, 
this grid was between 4 km by 4 km and 16 km by 16 km. At the 
points of intersection of the grid, the crowns of 24 marked 
trees at each point were assessed from the ground in July and 
August. The leaf or needle loss of these trees was estimated. 
  Numerous associations and environmentalists, however, warn 
against overrating these data. On the one hand, the broad mesh 
of the measuring network only permits the assessment of trends 
over an entire Land, differentiated only according to the types 
of trees and age groups. Soil composition and the annual 
increase in biomass are important indicators for the progress of 
damage. Data on these items have not yet been included in the 
survey and will not be available until 1994. Merely counting 
leaves or needles is not very suitable for assessing forest 
decline, points out the study group of the Association of German 
Forest Owners. A slight recovery of "trees showing clear damage" 
as indicated by this year's report is, according to information 
of the forest owners, not to be attributed to improved air 
quality, but rather to a summer with growth-promoting weather. 
In addition, the results are distorted in that about 2% 
of the 
test trees die and are felled annually. Also, environmentalists 
criticize that even young trees that are scarcely knee high are 
counted in the survey just like old, mature samples. In 
addition, larger areas where the trees have died off no longer 
appear in the statistics as former forest areas. 
  The declining forest still generates a number of questions 
for science. Why do different types of trees react so 
differently? Why do many forests grow at a greater rate now than 
50 years ago in spite of a reduced mass of needles and leaves? 
What portion of the decline can be attributed to air pollutants 
such as sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, ammonia 
and ozone, what portion to weather, what portion to insect pests 
and disease-causing agents? The "Forest Decline" advisory 
committee had already determined in 1989 that "in the face of 
the numerous relationships of location, composition, management, 
and pollution factors, there cannot be a simple explanation of 
the causes for the new type of forest decline valid uniformly 
for all forests." 
  The scientist have not advanced their knowledge much further 
at this time. In the meantime, the Federal Research Ministry 
(BMFT) established forest ecosystem centers at the Universities 
of Bayreuth and Gottingen. Here, research should change its 
emphasis from the previous study of individual pollutant effects 
to the analysis of the entire forest ecosystem. The annual 
budget of about 33 million Deutsche marks, however, appears 
rather meager when compared to the 477 million Deutsche marks 
that the Federal Government and its Lands have expended since 
1984 for so-called accompanying forest measures -- 175 million 
Deutsche marks for liming and compensation fertilizing of the 
forest soil and 170 million Deutsche marks for reforestation. 
  The many question marks in forest decline research should 
not 
prevent politics from acting. Environmental associations have 
been demanding this for years. "In reality, there is still no 
such thing as forest preservation policy," criticizes Dr. Helmut 
Klein. He is from the Association for the Preservation of the 
Environment and Nature of Germany. Just how difficult it is to 
provide concrete political measures to preserve the forest is 
shown by the example of the Fertilizer Use Ordinance. Besides 
air-borne sulfur and nitrous oxides, agricultural fertilizers 
containing nitrogen throw the forest ecosystem out of balance. 
An ordinance prohibiting excessive fertilization has been kept 
in the wings for years. 
  Another important question is still on ice. Should forest 
owners be compensated for the dying trees? An inter-ministerial 
study group was to calculate what economic damage was done to 
the forest by which air pollutants. In the meantime, this study 
group has stopped work. "There is no money available for such 
compensation," fears Assistant Secretary Peter Splett from the 
Forestry Management Department of the Federal Ministry for 
Agriculture. If forest owners are compensated for their sick 
trees, the owners of monuments or public buildings would also 
have to be compensated for the loss in value caused by air 
pollutants. The question of compensation is about to be 
clarified by the Federal Constitutional Court. If the justices 
decide in favor of compensation, "That would become a bottomless 
pit," says Splett.

<F P=106> [Article by Si: "Three-way System Solves the Plastics </F>
Problem"] 
  [Text] 
  In the future, processed material, raw material and thermal 
methods will be used jointly. The chance for plastics to 
develop into a recyclable packaging material continues to 
increase. Since the Federal German Packaging Ordinance went into 
effect, more and more paths are bypassing the landfill. 
  According to Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "the question of plastic 
recycling will be answered by 1998," simply by means of 
raw-material recycling. Dr. Eckell is the chairman of the 
Association of the Plastics Producing Industry. He said that the 
chemical transformation of plastic waste back into its initial 
products could recycle several hundred thousand metric tons in 
the coming years. This was recently at the symposium on 
"Plastics + Environment" in Cologne. 
  The announced recycling push is also urgently needed. 
However, in the opinion of Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer, in the 
future, human labor will no longer be scarce. Rather energy, raw 
materials, and environmental media will be the scarce 
commodities of the economy. This will show up in the costs of 
the production processes as desired by the Federal Minister of 
the Environment. For this reason, he wants to continue to set 
clear priorities and provide an economic stimulus for material 
recycling (quota for plastics starting on 1 January 1998: at 
least 60%, half of this by means of polymer 
reutilization) even 
in the amendment of the Packaging Ordinance. However, Topfer 
also admits that thermal recycling is not only a possibility but 
a necessity for the remaining 40%. 
  The recycling principle behind the German Packaging 
Ordinance 
is correct in the opinion of Wolfram Bruck. He is the manager of 
Dual System Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. "Our government was 
compelled to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills 
because an economy can also choke on clogged landfills." Today, 
with the help of the Dual System, about 50% of the volume 
has 
been transferred from the trash cans of Federal German 
households onto other recycling tracks. 
  In Cologne, Prof. Dr. Michael Droscher also confirmed the 
necessity of plastics recycling. "Used plastics do not belong in 
landfills," according to the chemist with a master's degree, 
responsible for environmental issues at Huls. Independent of 
this, there is less and less landfill space available. Droscher 
says, "In 1977, there were still 1,355 landfills. Today, there 
are about 290 and, by 1995, the capacity will drop again by 
50%." 
  In spite of this, the plastics expert remains skeptical with 
regard to the recycling quotas of the Minister of the 
Environment. "At some specific recycling quota, we start to make 
ecological nonsense," says Droscher. For this reason, the 
plastic recycling should not be controlled using rigid quotas 
but rather using ecological and economical factors. Droscher 
says, "There is no one true path. Every recycling path must be 
optimized. Processed-material recycling is to be limited to 
large pure material streams. Raw-material recycling and thermal 
recycling should handle large quantities of mixed plastics. 
Small and highly polluted packaging should remain in the trash 
and be mineralized, thus incinerated, with this trash."

<H3>  Environmental Protection Technology Provides Additional 
Company Profit </H3>
<H3>  Integrated Recovery Systems for Etching and Electroplating 
Return Valuable Materials to Production </H3>
  Effective environmental protection in a company does not 
just 
result in costs. Sometimes it becomes a profitable business if 
advanced recycling technology is used. Siemens Matsushita 
Components GmbH in Heidenheim and Siemens-Steckverbinderwerk 
[connector factory] in Speyer are demonstrating this. 
  The environment is being saved in the future from 18,000 
m[.sup]3[/] of waste water and up to 7,000 metric tons of 
compressed sludge residue. This previously resulted from the 
etching of aluminum capacitors. At the same time, the 
electronics firm of Siemens Matsushita Components has reduced 
the operating costs in its capacitor factory in Heidenheim by 
1.7 million Deutsche marks annually. The system required an 
investment of 1.2 million Deutsche marks to realize these 
production and environmental goals. It is about 500,000 Deutsche 
marks cheaper than the previous model. 
  Jakob Bauer is the Siemens environmental manager who 
provided 
these figures. He also provided information regarding the 
technical details. According to him, the new system is achieving 
a high degree of recycling. "Of the hydrochloric and sulfuric 
acids used here, 80% are recovered from used etching 
baths. 
Previously, these acids would be neutralized, the sludge removed 
and sent for waste disposal." This activity shows up in the 
statement of costs because resources are now being returned to 
the production cycle. Jakob Bauer emphasizes that, in 
Heidenheim, the bath residues coming from the etching process 
are "separated into highly acidic and weakly acidic fractions 
using a membrane method, diffusion dialysis. These fractions are 
rich in metals." In this way, according to Bauer, it has become 
possible to extend the working life of the etching baths. This 
saves money. Besides this, not only is 96% of the aluminum 
salts retained but also, in an additional step, they serve the 
goal of environmental protection. Now, these salts are supplied 
to community sewage treatment plants which can make use of them 
again as precipitating agents. 
<H5>  Electroplating in the Siemens Factory in Speyer </H5>
  Waste water treatment that makes minimal use of chemicals, 
water cycling for rinsing baths, and recovery methods for 
resource recycling increase environmental protection and company 
profit. Another example of methods providing both increased 
environmental protection and profit potential is the 
Siemens-Kabelwerk [cable factory] in Mudanya in Turkey. There, a 
recycling system for cable remainders has been in operation for 
a few months. This system first breaks up the incoming lines and 
then separates the polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride of the 
cable sheath from the copper by means of a vibrating chute. In 
this way, the plastics can be used again and copper with a 
purity of 99.5% and which can be smelted again is 
recovered. In 
addition, claims Bauer, this environmental protection system 
also contributes to Siemens' profit with 250,000 Deutsche marks 
annually. 
  Behind these and other production methods and products is, 
according to Bauer, the idea that, "we need to work on complete 
solutions for the emission areas of waste water, waste products 
and exhaust air. In these solutions, the sum of all emissions 
should represent an optimized minimum." These environmentally 
conscious production methods and products will not always be a 
profit-generating investment for the companies. In addition, a 
safety system is to be created for the emission areas of soil 
and ground water which "is adapted to the existing potential 
danger." 
  Systems that traditionally pose particular problems for the 
environment include electroplating shops such as those in the 
Siemens Steckverbinderwerk in Speyer. These systems are 
problematic because of their use of water-polluting materials 
and because of their often large requirement for rinse water. 
However, it can be seen even here how a modern plant of this 
type can be created to protect the environment. 
  "In Speyer," says Bauer, "we no longer operate with the 
conventional end-of-pipe technology. Rather, we treat the waste 
water using the advanced side-stream method." Recovery methods 
integrated into the process here serve the recycling of 
resources. The remaining waste water is treated according to 
special concepts designed to make minimal use of chemicals. 
These innovations also include a control and documentation 
system under computer control. The usefulness of these 
innovations has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of waste 
water by about one half. As "we now recover 2,000 kg of copper, 
80 kg of palladium and 6 kg of gold and 7,500 liters of 
polishing bath and 1,700 liters of nickel bath annually, the 
metal hydroxide waste is also reduced by about one third," 
summarizes Jakob Bauer.

  [Text] In the activated sludge tanks of purification 
plants, bacteria take on important tasks. They break down a 
variety of undesirable compounds like ammonia and highly toxic 
problem materials. The simulation of growth processes in the 
tanks is necessary in the investigation of decomposition 
processes. Wolfgang Tappe of the Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH 
(Institute for Biotechnology IBT 3, 52425 Juelich) has now 
developed a bioreactor system which is suitable for these tasks. 
  As Tappe reported in Juelich, bacteria have a very low 
growth 
rate in the soil and in the water as well as in purification 
plants. The supply of nutrients is often so low that it allows 
bacteria only to survive but not to grow. The investigation of 
these processes in important in view of the role of bacteria in 
decomposing toxic materials. But with conventional bioreactor 
systems the simulation of such growth conditions is either 
impossible or possible only to a very limited degree. In a 
continuouly operating laboratory bioreactor a certain amount of 
fresh nutrient solution is added per unit of time and the 
corresponding amount of used medium removed. In the process 
biomass is lost which must be replaced by the growth of bacteria 
in the reactor. But if the maximal growth rate of the organisms 
is very low the danger exists that the lost biomass cannot be 
replaced. 
  In activated sludge plants the medium generation spans are 
between 150 and 500 hours, and thus are relatively long. 
Conventional bioreactor systems are often overextended in 
simulating these growth conditions. Since the addition of 
nutrient solution in this case is very low, it sometimes happens 
that an even distribution in the reactor is not achieved. The 
result is that the bacterial population is no longer 
homogeneous. Some bacteria grow more rapidly than others. 
  In the Juelich reactor the solution of this problem involves 
reservation of the biomass. The main difference in comparison to 
conventional, continuously running reactors is the separately 
arranged filtration module. That is where the used medium is 
filtered while retaining the bacteria. The filtration is not 
simple, since the round filter tends to become clogged. Tappe 
solved this problem with a cross-flow technique. Close over the 
membrane is a revolving magnetic stirring rod, which creates a 
current moving diagonally to the direction of filtration 
(cross-flow). With this device clogging can be successfully 
prevented. 
  The module is surrounded by a refined steel housing and is 
connected to the reactor container by means of tubing and pumps. 
In this way a continuous addition of nutrients can be achieved 
without loss of biomass, and bacteria with very low growth rates 
can be investigated. These growth conditions are very close to 
the actual conditions in activated sludge tanks. The filtration 
module of the Juelich system can also be used for on-line 
supervision of purification plants. It provides a sample free of 
biomass from which chemical parameters can be determined.

  [Text] Engineering diagnosis of electrical operating 
equipment and systems increases their reliability and prevents 
their depreciation. It thus becomes an important tool for 
environmental protection. 
  If the saying that runners never have time needed 
validation, 
Otfried Maus would be the living proof. Previously active at the 
Buna in Schkopau throughout his professional life and now a 
university instructor, he tirelessly espouses his belief to 
students during lectures and to European enterprises during 
conferences: "The state of the insulation in electrical 
operating equipment can be checked and monitored by diagnostic 
methods. Diagnostic measurements are performed in the course of 
periodic inspection." 
  He stuns his audience not by just stating this proposition, 
which can be looked up in every better textbook. Rather, he does 
so with his practical accomplishment the field of diagnostics 
during his work at the Buna in East Germany. This senior 
engineer has often even stunned managers of prominent Swedish, 
Austrian, and Swiss firms as well as of German ones. 
  At that chemical enterprise he did, first alone and later 
with a staff of assistants and in collaboration with 
universities, perform diagnostic measurements long before they 
had been included in international maintenance standards. One 
thing always interested him in cables, electric motors and 
generators, transformers and switchgear: "I recognized the 
possibility of ensuring fitness-oriented maintenance by 
consistent analysis of causes of anomalies occurring after 
repair. In this way I was able to minimize the probability of 
disturbances and accidents, thus increasing the reliability of 
the operating equipment." 
  Otfried Maus wanted more. By means of diagnostic engineering 
measurements, he tried again and again to determine the state of 
the insulation in electrical operating equipment and the state 
of bearings in rotating or driven mechanical equipment. On the 
basis of the readings, he not only wanted to devise inspection 
and maintenance schedules but also wanted to be able to estimate 
the remaining service life of operating equipment and components 
so that necessary new investments for replacement could be made 
on time. 
  "We had to recognize very soon however," recalls Maus, "that 
the results of diagnostic measurements cannot be interpreted 
upon a simple evaluation of the readings. Their interpretation 
requires a great deal of expert knowledge, experience, and 
self-reliance". It cannot be done without team work and exchange 
of ideas. Collaboration was needed even more so during the GDR 
(German Democratic Republic) era, because the necessary 
measurement technique often could not be purchased. Own in-house 
developments and cooperation with fellow specialists, say at the 
Technical Universities in Dresden and in Prague, led time and 
again to realization of new instruments and methods. 
  And today Maus continues to advocate exchange of experience. 
In October 1992 he issued invitations to a conference in 
Schkopau on "Environment-Friendly Maintenance of Electric 
Machines and Plants." This conference was a continuation of the 
traditional biennial 1983-1989 series which he had organized at 
the Buna Works jointly with the Technical Department "Electrical 
Engineering" at the Chamber of Technology (GDR) and the 
Technical University in Dresden. The good response to this 1992 
new version encouraged Maus to conceive another such conference 
to be held in fall 1994.

<H5>  MAINTENANCE: Tips and Tricks </H5>
  1. Inspection of bearings in electric motor drives: After 
having recorded and evaluated the diagnostic data with the aid 
of a computer, we submitted the results to the operators with 
recommendation as to necessary steps to be taken. By repeating 
the measurements periodically, we monitored the steps taken and 
their effects. Our software also contained data on the location 
of machine sets, on the kind of drives, on the operating 
conditions, on prior disturbances, and on typical worn parts. 
  2. Generator and motor windings: By measurements made during 
partial load dumping, we determined the state of the insulation 
of individual coils. Depending on the results of diagnosis, it 
was decided whether a new complete winding should be installed 
or replacement of the damaged coil will suffice. 
  3. Transformers in industrial plants and electric 
public-utility networks: In oil-filled and thus high-cost 
transformers, for instance, electric and thermal anomalies 
during their still harmless early stage already produce small 
amounts of noxious gases which dissolve in the insulating oil. 
Using the appropriate methods, we extracted these gases from the 
oil and analyzed them by gas chromatography. The examinations 
were performed systematically, without considering the course of 
operation, whereupon we evaluated the results using a special 
computer program. In this way faults were detected already in 
the initial stage. 
  4. Switchgear components: Besides mechanical loads also and 
above all electrical loads can produce weak spots in the 
insulation, whether under the applied voltage or during fast 
short events such as switching, ground fault, short circuit, or 
lightning stroke. Using the appropriate methods and instruments, 
we have checked the state of the insulation during operation. 
From the results one can learn not only about just the 
switchgear alone, however. With a sufficiently sensitive method 
of diagnosis and with enough experience on hand, it is even 
possible to extract from the main switchgear of an industrial 
network ideas about the state of the insulation of equipment 
operating in substations tied into that network.

<H5>  COMMENT: Longer Usable Products </H5>
  "If we squander and destroy our natural resources, strip the 
land instead of cultivating so as to increase its yield, we will 
undermine the very prosperity which we are duty-bound to enhance 
and pass on to our children". What sounds like warning a given 
today about the consequences of destroying the environment is in 
fact already 86 years old. In the year 1907 President Theodore 
Roosevelt expressed his concern about this in his message to the 
United States Congress. 
  The admonition is still as timely. It was established at the 
1992 United Nations Conference on "Environment and Growth" in 
Rio de Janeiro that "the world must now face the beginnings of 
an ecological revolution or will risk an ecological collapse and 
economic demise." 
  There have been warnings, action is now called for. In order 
to ensure that damages to the environment do not become 
irreversible, it is necessary to institute unavoidable 
fundamental changes in the production, consumption, and disposal 
of goods. Society must place a higher value on conservation and 
efficiency, and to an even higher measure emphasize renewable 
energy sources. As a rule of thumb, for every ton of waste 
material from a product at the end of the latter's useful life 
there were five more tons of tailings lost in manufacture of the 
product and 20 tons of the material lost during during its 
shipment. Doubling the average useful life of a product not only 
would cut in half the energy consumption and the amount as well 
as pollution but also would delay depletion of natural resources. 
  Environment-friendly production technologies need to be 
developed and products need to be made more durable, i.e., their 
useful life needs to be lengthened and their repair, i.e., 
maintenance needs to be simplified. Engineering diagnosis, by 
the way, can be helpful in optimizing the design of products for 
a longer useful life and their easier maintenance.

<H5>  Perfect Minimizers </H5>
  A team of scientists at the Trier University has analyzed 
170 
environmental engineering enterprises. The result: three recipes 
for success. 
  Everybody is familiar with performance indicators such as 
competitive prices, manufacturing flexibility, filling of market 
niches, reliability of delivery, or technical standard. But the 
FOKUM team (Simone Amann, Simone Schuemmelfeder, Dagmar 
Stupperich, Dirk Wolter, Martin Fontanari, Markus Keller) did 
not take it so easily. "analyzing over 50 performance indicators 
was found to be an extremely complex task" groans research 
director Fontanari. It has become obvious at first glance that 
no enterprise can successfully optimize all performance 
indicators. "We were therefore interested in which aspects of 
performance are being enhanced and also which groups of 
enterprises are focusing on the same combinations of performance 
indicators." 
  Using a special statistical evaluation process, the FOKUM 
team arrived at three types of strategy by which the leading 
contestants have entered the market. 
  FORMULAS FOR SUCCESS: Three splendid types of 
strategy 
  Type 1: 


    -  making products of high technical quality, 
  -  reducing production costs, 
  -  customer assistance, 
  -  volume expansion, 
  -  wholesale distribution, 
  -  , 
  -  Cost Leader. 

    Type 2: 


    -  filling market niches, 
  -  filling diverse market segments, 
  -  comprehensive customer assistance, 
  -  package deals, 
  -  engineering design of products, 
  -  image building, 
  -  , 
  -  Customer-Oriented Package Deal Designer 

    Type 3: 


    -  filling market niches and diverse market segments, 
  -  comprehensive customer assistance, 
  -  package deals, 
  -  image building and advertising, 
  -  securing technical advantage, 
  -  streamlining and optimization of production sector, 
  -  competitive pricing 
  - 
  -  Customer-Oriented Cost Minimizer 

    The first type of strategy surpasses the customer-oriented 
second and third types with competence in volume expansion and 
wholesale distribution. This suggest series production. Only a 
minority of enterprises can do the trick of holding their ground 
exclusively in price competition on a market oriented toward 
individual customers. These are mostly small medium-size 
enterprises and genuine providers of environmental engineering 
products, mainly to soil and waste treatment, clean air 
protection, and power technology sectors of industry. Half of 
them do not invest in new technologies but consider improvements 
only. They are not at all interested in collaboration with other 
enterprises. 
  The second type of strategy is entirely different. 
Characterized by an excellent production technology, it helps 
enterprises acquire an image of first-rate manufacturers. This 
type of strategy emphasizes customer assistance and individually 
designed high-value deals. It does not lead to a higher 
production efficiency in terms of neat cost reduction measures, 
neither does it contribute to competitive pricing. It will make 
a difference in quality and service only. Small to medium-size 
enterprises using this type of strategy are genuine providers of 
technical know-how in water treatment as well as in soil and 
waste treatment. They rely on uniquely high quality of products 
and close rapport with customer. Half of them invest in new 
technologies, mostly from net earnings, and expect to gain 
competitive advantages by collaboration with others. 
  The "customer-oriented cost minimizing" third type of 
strategy is perfect. Enterprises using it have achieved 
"quadrature of the circle", because they offer a difference in 
customer-orientation and product quality while being at the same 
time able to offer competitive prices. This type of strategy 
makes winners in the product quality contest. Enterprises using 
it have most modern production facilities and can afford to pass 
their cost advantage along to customers in terms of lower prices 
so as to thus gain latitude securing, say, investments in 
manufacturing technologies. Among them are large enterprises 
which diversify in the environmental market and fill niches in 
it. Customers for their products are first of all water 
treatment, clean air protection, and peripheral sectors of the 
environmental industry. Firms using this type of strategy invest 
mostly in improvement of technologies. Every second such 
enterprise expects to gain competitive advantages by 
collaboration.

  [Text] 1993 was the year of wind energy. The market for 
this clean and renewable energy source is experiencing a strong 
boom. According to the German Wind Energy Institute (DWI), the 
German wind energy park accumulated a total of 100 megawatts of 
rated output in 1993 (70 megawatts in 1992). One of the reasons 
for the increase, along with Federal and state funding programs 
and the selling price of 16.5 pfennigs per kilowatt hour 
guaranteed by the current input law of 1991, is the clear 
tendency to build large plants with a rated output of at least 
500 kW, now being produced serially by several manufacturers. 
Experts anticipate that within two years at the most windmills 
with rated output of a megawatt and more will be available in 
series. 
  The tendency to larger size has continuously increased the 
affordability of windmills, according to the rule of thumb, "the 
bigger, the cheaper." Today it is possible for windmills in 
windy areas, generally situated on the coast, to produce current 
at a cost of 8 to 16 pfennigs per kilowatt hour, which is 
scarcely more expensive than energy from conventional power 
plants. Armin Keuper of the DWI anticipates that at these sites 
wind energy plants could be functioning even without state 
funding within five to seven years at most and be "commercially 
successful." That is why more and more professional investors 
are getting involved with wind power along with the communes and 
associations of environmentalist citizens. Even banks have 
discovered wind generators as investment possibilities. 
  The move to larger plants is amazing in view of the fact 
that 
at the very beginning a large-scale project which foundered took 
the wind out of the sails of the wind power movement. The 
so-called "Large Wind Energy Plant," popularly known as 
"Growian," was shut down in 1987 after a four-year test run 
because of technical flaws. After the failure of the 
three-megawatt generator and the dropping of the project by the 
disappointed major companies the industry went for small, simple 
plants, "away from technical development at one fell swoop and 
towards progress in small steps," as Keuper says. Such steps 
have brought about the development of wind technology from 
plants under 100 kW to today's size. Thus energy utilization per 
rotor surface has doubled over the last 10 years; wind current 
has gradually become about 30 percent cheaper since 1988. This 
was also helped by manufacturers' lowering of prices, which was 
made possible in part by increased productivity in serial 
production and was partly forced upon them by increasingly 
strong competition in the marketplace. 
  Volker Friedrichsen, managing director of the company Vestas 
Deutschland GmbH in Husum, says, "Technical improvements were 
achieved with the jump to each new size level because of 
increased experience." The Danish parent company is the largest 
international producer of wind energy plants. Their robust 
construction methods, rooted in agricultural technology, and 
gradually enhanced by modern technology, is very successful in 
the marketplace; the proof is the 4,300 wind wheels they have 
installed all over the world. This has not prevented other 
manufacturers from looking for success with innovative and 
technically demanding ideas. These include wind wheels with 
electronically regulated rotor blade installation for optimal 
wind utilization, with a variable rotation rate instead of a 
fixed one, and most recently also with a driveless generator, as 
offered by the company Heidelberg Motor GmbH in Starnberg or 
Enercon GmbH in Aurich. Technology pioneers are particularly 
hoping for greater economy based on higher efficiency from these 
new developments. 
  However, this advantage has not yet appeared. So far, in 
Keuper's professional opinion, there are "hardly any 
differences" between the plant concepts available on the market 
in price per kilowatt hour. Other experts point out that for 
enduring market success the plants have to establish themselves 
not only in Germany, but also on the world market. Here the 
traditional plants are considered to be proven, reliable 
technology. This reputation, which encourages business with the 
developing and emerging nations as well as with the Eastern 
European states, still has to be earned by high-tech windmills.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Possible Sites in Gard, Haute-Marne, </F>
Meuse, and Vienne for Waste Storage Study Laboratories"] 
  [Text] Paris--Four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Meuse, 
and Vienne have been suggested as possible sites for installing 
two underground research laboratories for the storage of nuclear 
waste, according to a 5 January announcement by Christian 
Bataille, chief negotiator for these installations. Bataille 
also announced that "everything indicates that the government 
will present proposals in the next few days," and he added that 
only two sites would ultimately be picked. 
  More thorough investigations led by the Bureau of Geological 
and Mining Research (BRGM) are planned for 1994 in those 
departments. It will take another year to officially announce 
the two sites chosen for installing the laboratories, which are 
stipulated by the law of 30 December 1991. 
  While four geological strata--clay, granite, schist, and 
salt--are considered suitable for holding highly active and 
long-lived nuclear waste, which is the most dangerous--the 
Bataille project has retained only the clay and granite options 
after reviewing the initial geological data. 
  Bataille and his assistant, the prefect Jacques Monestier, 
selected six likely departments out of thirty which applied to 
the negotiators last year--Gard, Marne, Haute-Marne, 
Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, and Vienne. This selection was later 
narrowed down to the four mentioned earlier in this article. 
  Bataille made several recommendations in the report he 
presented to the ministers of Industry, Environment, and Land 
Management, Messrs Gerard Longuet, Michel Barnier, and Charles 
Pasqua. He suggested that "the dialogue" initiated under his 
authority be "pursued at the national and local levels." When 
the time comes to build the storage facility--in 2008 at the 
latest--he requests that the possibility of waste storage 
reversibility resulting from research conducted by the Atomic 
Energy Commission (CEA), among others, be taken into account. 
Finally, according to him, the future of the laboratories once 
their work is accomplished should be "guaranteed and formalized." 
  Each laboratory, employing 150 people including about 30 
scientists, should require an investment of one and a half 
billion francs and will serve for fifteen years. Operating costs 
for each are estimated at 70 million per year in addition to 60 
million annually for local development.

<F P=106> [Article: "Modern Urban Waste Treatment Plant in Yvelines"] </F>
  [Text] Versailles--Carrieres-sous-Poissy (Yvelines) has 
been chosen as the site for an urban waste treatment and 
conversion plant described as one of the least polluting in the 
world, it was learned at a 13 January press conference. The 
plant will serve 15 of the region's communes. 
  This plant, unique in France in many respects, aims at "zero 
pollution." Once it goes into service--it is scheduled to begin 
operations in late 1996--it will process each year about 100,000 
tons of household waste "produced" by the 200,000 inhabitants of 
the 15 communes that have joined in partnership under the 
umbrella of an intercommunal syndicate headed by the deputy 
mayor of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Mr. Michel Pericard. 
  Its standards for waste purification are 2 to 12 times as 
strict as those currently required in France. "For some ejecta, 
pollution levels are not even measurable today," said Mr. 
Pericard. For example, even the water-vapor plume released 
through the plant's smokestack will be eliminated with the help 
of condensation equipment. "We have accepted a financial 
sacrifice to obtain these results," admitted Mr. Pericard, 
noting that the cost of waste processing would be 498 French 
francs [Fr], versus Fr370 in the past. 
  Dubbed "Azalys," the project was developed by Novergie (a 
part of the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez economic interest group) at 
a total cost of Fr355.8 million. It also takes special pains 
with "final residues": the sludge that will be used in laying 
road underpaving, and treated oven-smoke residues. Those 
residues will be rendered "inert" before storage. 
  Described by Mr. Pericard as a "technological showcase," the 
project was approved after 10 years of negotiations among the 
region's communes and represents a step toward meeting the 
target of eliminating all discharges of untreated waste by the 
year 2002 set forth in legislation enacted on 13 July 1992.

  [Text] Strasbourg/Paris--The daily newspaper LES DERNIERES 
NOUVELLES D'ALSACE reported 15 January that French researchers 
from the European School for Advanced Chemical Industry Research 
(EHICS) had just devised new molecules that can trap cesium with 
great efficiency. The Atomic Energy Commission's Nuclear 
Research Center in Cadarache and COGEMA (General Nuclear 
Materials Company) collaborated with EHICS on the molecules, 
which are dubbed calixarenes. 
  "In the future, calixarenes may be able to reduce the volume 
and weight of radioactive waste by a factor of 100. Highly 
radioactive waste, which is buried 500 meters underground, could 
be concentrated, while waste of lower radioactive levels could 
be stored 20 meters below the surface," said one of the research 
team "bosses", Jacques Vincens of EHICS. 
  Calixarenes are one of the first industrial applications of 
supramolecular chemistry, whose father, Professor Jean-Marie 
Lehn, won the 1987 Nobel prize for chemistry. The Atomic Energy 
Commission (CEA) describes the cup-shaped molecules as a "step 
forward" in research to manage highly-active, long-lived 
radioactive waste. But it will be at least another 10 years 
before the molecules can be applied industrially. 
  Jean-Yves Barre, director of the CEA's "fuel cycle" 
division, 
explained to the AFP that calixarene, a "highly selective 
chemical gripper", is "a cage-molecule that will be able to 
capture the desired element in a solution, extract it from the 
solution, and release it on demand." Another advantage of using 
the "very selective" molecule to extract radioactive elements is 
that it is not very water-soluble and does not deplete. In other 
words, "Calixarenes are not destroyed through use." 
  For now, calixarene molecules can only trap cesium and its 
various isotopes extracted together. Cesium isotopes include 
long-lived (2.3 million years) cesium-135, which researchers 
want to recover, and cesium-137, which has an average lifespan 
(30 years). Barre says that the team headed by Jean-Francois 
Dozo in Cadarache "has gotten yields of 99 percent." 
  The discovery is part of ongoing research programs--some of 
them European1--to find ways of reducing the 
noxiousness of long-lived, nuclear-plant radioactive waste 
through chemical separation or transmutation. The teams have 
been working on the calixarenes for seven or eight months, and 
recently filed a patent on the process. 
  In France, the investigations are an application of the 30 
December 1991 law on "research into the management of 
radioactive waste." The law also deals with "the study of 
possible ways to reversibly or irreversibly store waste in deep 
underground geological formations, notably in underground 
laboratories", and "research on ways to package and warehouse 
such waste for long periods on the surface." 
  The CEA has assigned 190 million French francs [Fr] and 250 
people to the separation/transmutation project, otherwise known 
as SPIN, or Separation and Incineration of Long-Lived 
Radioactive Elements. (The entire waste-management research 
program involves Fr440 million and a staff of 500.) SPIN itself 
consists of two subprograms: PURETEX, which aims to reduce waste 
and improve the performance of COGEMA's retreatment plants in La 
Hague (through enhanced separation of plutonium and neptunium, 
among other methods); and ACTINEX, which seeks to improve 
PURETEX and destroy long-lived products. ACTINEX employs 
additional separations of plutonium, neptunium, americium, and 
curium from long-lived fission products, using accelerators to 
transmute the long-lived radioactive elements contained in such 
waste.

  [Text] At an altitude of 1,400 meters on the Semenic 
mountain plateau, the first pilot wind power station is 
beginning to take shape not far from the well-known resort of 
the same name. The project's history in this area which, 
according to experts, is most favorable for wind energy 
exploitation, began three years ago with the operation of the 
first experimental 300-kw wind turbine, the result of joint 
efforts of the Timisoara Technical University faculty staff, the 
researchers and designers of the Specializing Institute in 
Timisoara, and the machine builders in Bocsa. Recently, a second 
such power unit has just passed into the final installation 
phase, to be followed by two more units which are presently 
being built and tested in the Bocsa plant and the Timisoara 
workshops respectively. These four experimental 300 kw 
"EOLTIM"-type turbines will constitute the first pilote wind 
power station in our country. The next phase in wind energy 
exploitation, considered presently to be the cheapest form in 
the world, is the installation of 100 turbines of this type, and 
in the more distant future--according to experts participating 
recently in an international symposium on the subject--the 
constructing of a 900-kw power station: a true record in the 
field.

<F P=106> [Article by Rio de Janeiro correspondent Sergio Adeodato] </F>
  [Text] The husband-and-wife team of Russian scientists 
Boris Margulis and Irina Fridlarkoca arrived in Rio de Janeiro 
last month with their family, and carrying in their luggage the 
technological know-how that enables them to swap their measly 
salaries of $50 a month in Moscow for the $3,000 monthly they 
will start earning as heads of the hybridoma laboratory at the 
recently established Universidade Estadual do Norte 
Fluminense--UENF [State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro], 
located in the municipality of Campos. 
  The university has already invested $60 million in plant and 
equipment. This month it begins the second semester since its 
founding, and it is hiring 22 Russian researchers to staff five 
high-tech laboratories in the fields of biotechnology, new 
materials, and molecular biology -- facilities at which projects 
will be carried out that are directly related to the 
socioeconomic realities of the northern Fluminense region, where 
agriculture and oil prospecting predominate. 
  "In 1992, right after we announced the intention to bring in 
Russian scientists, we received more than 300 resumes from 
Russia. We had to send four academic delegations to that country 
last year to make the selections," said Wanderley de Souza, the 
molecular biologist who is rector of UENF. He recalled that, 
with budget appropriations continuing to shrink, "working 
conditions for Russian scientists in most technological fields 
are very bad, maybe worse than in Brazil." 
  Boris and Irina, like other married foreign scientists who 
decided to move to Campos, will be given airline tickets for the 
entire family, in addition to a subsidy equivalent to two 
salaries so that they can settle in the city. This benefit is 
also extended to the unmarried. The contracts are for a minimum 
of two years. "Institutions in the United States have offered 
the Russians salaries averaging $5,000, but many opted for Rio 
de Janeiro, not just out of concern that they might experience 
discrimination by the Americans, but because of good medium and 
long-term market prospects for their technologies in Brazil," de 
Souza said. 
  Along with scientist Alexander Kineo, also contracted by the 
university, the couple will bring to Brazil advanced techniques 
for production of reagents to be used in faster and more 
efficient diagnosis of illnesses like toxoplasmosis, a disease 
transmitted by a protozoan that attacks the central nervous 
system and the eyes. The new diagnostic method (at present, this 
country imports the tests) will be developed by fusing cells 
that produce antibodies (the body's defense agents) with cells 
from tumors that have the ability to reproduce themselves on a 
large scale. This will produce a hybridoma, i.e., a cell that 
combines the capacity to defend an organism with the ability to 
multiply itself in large numbers, thereby making commercial 
production feasible. 
<H5>  Transgenics </H5>
  A group of eight Russian scientists, all with doctor's 
degrees and headed by Oleg Serov and Alexander Kerkis of the 
Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Academy of Sciences of 
Russia, will work on development of transgenic animals, such as 
goats that have been genetically altered to produce milk 
containing insulin. Other animals with transplanted genes might 
be used to obtain blood clotting factors that are vital to 
hemophiliacs. 
  The chief product of the new materials laboratory will be 
the 
technology for producing artificial diamonds by compression of 
carbon molecules. These diamonds are essential to equipment such 
as dentists' drills, marble-cutting tools, and oil-drilling 
bits--the latter being one of the region's main economic 
activities. 
  The technology of the synthetic materials known as 
"superhards," developed by a group of five Russian scientists 
that will work at UENF for two years, reflects the technological 
strategy being pursued by this institution: absorb the know-how 
at an advanced point in its development without spending many 
years on research, so that the technology can be transferred to 
industry in the midterm future. "The technologies will be 
intimately related to the vocations of this region," said Gilca 
Alves Wianstein, president of the State Foundation of Northern 
Rio de Janeiro, the institution responsible for administration 
of UENF, which has the flexibility and independence needed to 
set up commercial and technological partnerships with the 
production sector. 
  In the vicinity of its 25,000 square meter campus--which 
during the first semester of this academic year will house 278 
undergraduate and graduate students and 50 researchers--the UENF 
plans to encourage the formation of a high-tech complex 
sustained mainly by biofactories that produce cuttings for use 
in growing fruit and sugarcane, and in reforestation.

<H3>  Innovative Polymers Enhance Competitiveness of Many 
Industrial Branches </H3>
  Japan and the U.S.A. are increasing their strategic 
investments. "Long diffusion times in material development 
prevents speedy practical application." 
  Technologies of 21st Century High-Tech polymers 
and fiber- reinforced plastics can significantly contribute to 
continued competitiveness of the German industry. For this 
reason the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) in 
Bonn encourages further development in this field and has 
included high-performance polymers as a key technology in its 
R.&amp; D. strategy for the 21st century. The German plastics 
manufacturers are, however, more skeptical about it. 
  Innovative materials such as high-performance polymers or 
fiber-reinforced ones offer a favorable market outlook not for 
the manufacturer only. In addition they also influence the 
competitiveness of important groups of users, in some cases 
considerably. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology 
has an interest in technologies needed for making and 
appropriately processing these materials, and even special 
interest because of their major significance for future 
developments. In the "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st 
Century" study made by the BMFT, progress-oriented use of 
specialty polymers is regarded as one of the key technologies on 
which the health of the national economy will depend. 
  Accordingly, the people in Bonn have supported materials 
research since 1985 with almost 2 billion DM so far, of this 
amount 21.2% for new polymers and 19% for 
composites. "There 
is no doubt that this has substantially contributed to Germany's 
ability to maintain parity in materials research with leaders in 
this field, namely the U.S.A. and Japan. The German enterprises 
which had very actively participated in this program are today, 
unlike in 1985, among the enterprises engaged in most intense 
worldwide patent activity covering many areas. The problem is, 
however, that a German competence in materials and treatment 
technologies can today be found only in "islands of experts", 
while a consolidation of the acquired know-how into a 
comprehensive network is still lacking. 
  Evidently various German enterprises assess the market 
opportunities and possibilities for high-performance polymers 
and composite materials differently than do the people in Bonn. 
Following the motto "save whatever there is to save" based on 
the then prevailing economic trends, many enterprises have 
either withdrawn from this business altogether or are about to 
cut back their activities in this field. While at Bayer the 
emphasis is entirely on further development of engineering 
thermoplastics which can be sold in large quantities, Leverkusen 
has discontinued making a number of high-performance materials 
such as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP) and composites. Contrary 
to original expectations, they claim that the volume of these 
specialty materials sold has by far not reached the anticipated 
level. 
  The managers at Hoechst do, however, regard at least 
liquid-crystal polymers as a still very interesting group of 
materials with a future. Otherwise the Frankfurt people would 
certainly not expand their production capacity in the U,S.A., 
even though Peter Gleisberg in the Department of Engineering 
Plastics knows that for the time being such a high-performance 
material will remain a "niche product" only. 
  Meanwhile the BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in 
Ludwigshafen seeks its opportunities with high-temperature 
thermoplastics. Because according to Doctor Eckard Koch, 
plastics expert in the Application Engineering Department for 
Thermoplastics at the BASF, the increasing demand for these 
materials by the electrical and electronic industry as well as 
by the automotive industry will ensure their above average 
growth rate in the next few years. As to fiber-reinforced 
plastics, on the other hand, Leverkusen just as Bayer 
discontinued making them. 
  While consumption of engineering thermoplastics in West 
Europe, Japan, and the U.S.A. increased on the average by about 
290,000 tons annually (by 110,000 tons in West Europe alone) 
during the 1989-92 period, as reported by Bayer reports, the 
demand for specialty polymers increased only from 28,000 tons to 
37,000 tons over the 1982-91 period. This was too little to 
justify the high cost of their development and production. 
  "Because of high costs", maintains Dr. Manfred Schneider, 
"wherever European enterprises lose or do not to recapture their 
leading position in technology they are doomed to permanent 
failure. We must nevertheless remain innovative over the entire 
range of our activities." 
  "With specialty products alone the German industry, the 
European industry as well, will not be able to hold its position 
on the market" adds the chairman of the Bayer Corporation's 
board of directors. This means, among others, let us not spread 
ourselves too thin. In engineering thermoplastics Bayer sees a 
greater potential than in specialty polymers. 
  As to composite materials, the predictions made in the 
beginning of the nineteen eighties proved often to be also far 
too optimistic. The euphoria based on those predictions induced 
quite a flood of investment. This flood was soon followed by a 
more sober approach. Many mistakes had been made in production 
capacity and market volume planning. After fiber-reinforced 
plastics were particularly hard hit by both the recession and 
the end of the cold war (the latter resulting in drastic 
cutbacks in the military budget and thus in applications for 
these materials), many companies pulled the emergency brake: 
they sold their business enterprises in this field. 
  The reaction of the German-American Multi Dupont Ltd to 
these events was exactly the opposite. About one year ago this 
company first opened its European development center for 
composite materials in Bad Homburg. With an investment of over 
30 million DM, this company quite obviously bucked the 
prevailing market trend. For top management of the Multi Dupont 
Ltd agrees with the BMFT that, despite all the problems 
involved, high-performance materials and fiber-reinforced 
plastics offer important industries some strategic marketing 
advantages. 
  This can be seen in Japan and in the U.S.A. as well. 
According to the MITI, the R.&amp; D. efforts of Japanese 
enterprises in these areas will intensify and more than a 
constant rate in the coming years. They do, moreover, emphasize 
particularly effective efficiency-raising measures and 
collaboration strategies internationally as well as nationally. 
However, only institutes and enterprises already in strong 
position technologically will be accepted as partners. 
  In terms of R.&amp; D. efforts made to develop new 
materials, the 
U.S.A. by far surpasses Germany for years already. By developing 
new materials, the American industry expects to strengthen its 
competitiveness on the international market. 
  In both countries emphasis is on the system concept and on 
intensification of nationwide materials research in a 
surrounding of dynamic domestic user industries. Compared with 
that, in Germany the innovation process is still too much 
focused on basic research and manufacture concludes the 
"Evaluation of the Materials Research Program" study made by the 
BMFT. According to that study, materials research in this 
country continues nonetheless on a high internationally 
recognized level. It is however necessary not only to keep it at 
this level but also to intensify it in selected strategically 
important areas of application for high-performance materials. 
  New high-voltage ignition cables can be installed in motor 
vehicles as well as in oil or gas burners operating at 
temperatures from -40C to 200C. Owing to layer of 
insulation made from fluorocarbon plastics "teflon" and 
"tefzel", these cables are 60% thinner the conventional 
ones. 
  Water-resistant sliding bearings made of "iglidur" have been 
developed for duty in very humid air. This composite material, 
usable at temperatures up to 230C, consists of a 
fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and solid-lubricant inclusions.

<H3>  High-Performance Plastics Still Often Hobbled by Economic 
Hurdle </H3>
  Heat-resistant thermoplastics how have the greatest 
development potential. High-performance polymers constitute a 
very promising class of materials and have already entered areas 
of application heretofore assigned to metals, glass, or ceramic 
only. They will become increasingly important in the future, 
despite a few problems relating to economics. 
  "High-temperature thermoplastics can today already withstand 
temperatures about 350C for short durations, temperatures 
above 250C continuously causing no problem any more." Dr. 
Eckard Koch predicts above average growth rates for these 
materials in the coming years. The plastics expert in the 
Application Engineering Department for Thermoplastics at the 
BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in Ludwigshafen believes 
that these materials will play a more significant role 
especially in the electrical and electronic industry, where now 
the principal demand for them exists. 
  One of the reasons for the further increasing demand is that 
"exactly in this industry the fire resistance requirements are 
becoming more stringent" says Doctor Koch. "Because of new 
specifications regarding precautions and commercial use, fire 
proofing by conventional means will in the future be done to a 
limited extent only." 
  The automotive industry, too, promises a growing demand for 
these materials. According to Doctor Koch, work is now being 
done on parts located near the engine block. Here pressure-cast 
aluminum is eventually to be replaced with high-performance 
thermoplastics. 
  Also Grad. Eng. Gerhard Kloetgen also recognizes the 
greatest 
economic potential for highly heat-resistant polymers in the 
automotive industry as well as in the electrical and electronic 
sector. The sales manager for engineering materials at the 
DuPont Nemours Deutschland (Germany) Ltd in Bad Homburg sees 
future applications generally where the requirements exceed the 
capability limits of conventional materials. He finds it almost 
impossible, however, to quantify their innovation potential in 
terms of worth. This is especially so because of a specific 
problem peculiar to all high-performance polymers: They do in 
many cases fail the economics test. "The development costs are 
very high, owing to the small ratio of quantities eventually 
sold to the potential production yield" says Kloetgen. The 
prevailing enormous downward pressure on prices makes it, 
moreover, very difficult to cover these costs with the proceeds 
from sales a product stored in the warehouse. 
  This was a sufficient reason for the Bayer Corporation to 
discontinue producting of several high-performance polymers such 
as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP), polyphenylene sulfides (PPS), 
and composite materials. Meanwhile the Leverkusen people are 
concentrating more on engineering thermoplastics. 
  Polyether ketones (PEK) are the best among heat-resistant 
thermoplastics. They can withstand temperatures above 250C 
and remain rigid under heat. Their excellent mechanical 
properties are reflected in their Young's modulus: 4000 
N/mm[.sup]2[/] without reinforcement, still 3000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] even 
at 150C. When reinforced with carbon 
fibers, 
their Young's modulus rises to 20,000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] and 
higher. 
  Its high flexural fatigue strength even at elevated 
temperatures makes the "Ultrapek" polyether ketone an ideal 
material for gears when light weight as well as sufficient 
overload capacity and adequate chemical resistance are demanded 
all at the same time. 
  Polyether imides (PEI), according to Peter Stahl, feature an 
outstanding combination of thermal stability, flame repellence, 
electrical properties, and high mechanical durability. The 
technical director at the Plastics subsidiary of the German 
General Electric Company in Ruesselsheim includes them among the 
few thermoplastics approved for the interior furnishing of 
aircraft, because of their high oxygen index along with the thin 
smoke and the low toxity in case of fire among other favorable 
properties. 
  "The great application potential of polyether imides should 
also lead to an economic winner" adds Peter Stahl. Their growth 
proceeds at double-digit rates, even though at this time there 
is an oversupply of high-temperature thermoplastics on the 
European market. The development potential of polyether imides 
has, however, by far not yet been realized. 
  One of the most important goals for Peter Stahl is improving 
processability. The range of applications can thus be broadened 
by new kinds of blends, i.e., mixtures of plastics. Research is 
being done not only on blends but also on copolymers which 
promise entirely new properties and applications. 
Semicrystalline polyphenylene sulfides have a properties profile 
very similar to that of polyether ketones. They not only can 
withstand high service temperatures and are inherently very 
flame-repellent but also have a high chemical and oxidation 
resistance along with adequate hardness and stiffness. 
  Also liquid-crystal polymers can withstand service at 
temperatures significantly above 200C. They surpass steel 
in tensile strength and yet are much lighter. They have a high 
chemical resistance, also against polar and nonpolar solvents or 
acids. Peter Gleisberg, product manager at "Vectra" (trade name 
of liquid-crystal polymers made by Hoechst), is convinced that 
these engineering materials still have a great development 
potential. "They will find their market wherever an extremely 
high fluidity, narrow tolerances, and stability during soldering 
are demanded." 
  In order to impart high mechanical strength to a part made 
of 
a crystalline polymer and to optimize the layout of its 
structural unit for minimum weight, it would be necessary to 
orient the molecular chains in the entire part with their 
principal axis in the direction of the acting load. This should 
make such a layout much more difficult to achieve, as experience 
at the Institute of Plastics Engineering in Aachen has 
confirmed. Without the aid of simulation programs, for one, it 
is hardly possible to predict the orientations of molecular 
chains in individual layers and the thicknesses of those layers 
in the the finished part. Furthermore, most engineers who design 
injection molding equipment are not used to take into account 
the anisotropic behavior of a material inside the mold.

<F P=106> [Article by "bh" under the rubric "Companies, Research, </F>
Technology": "New Catalysts for Special Plastics"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--In the estimation of polymer chemists, 
catalytically produced polyolefin plastics in the next few years 
should increasingly supplant plastics produced by high-pressure 
free-radical polymerization. The metallocene catalysts 
introduced at the end of the 80s made possible the "custom-made" 
synthesis of rubber-elastic, heat-resistant and other 
interesting plastics. In addition, the new plastics are lighter, 
reprocessable and accordingly more environmentally friendly than 
the standard first-generation plastics. 
  As Rolf Muhlhaupt of Freiburg emphasizes, it has 
become 
possible by choosing the catalyst to synthesize polyolefins 
having desired properties. The mechanical, optical, 
morphological and processing properties of the plastics can be 
altered selectively by means of the new high-tech catalysts. 
Above all, the discovery of single-site catalysts has opened up 
entirely new capabilities for the synthesis of polyolefins. 
  Muhlhaupt writes in the journal NACHRICHTEN AUS 
CHEMIE, 
TECHNIK UND LABORATORIUM (Vol 41, p 1341) that examples of this 
are copolymers in which, as in the case of a 
polypropylene/polyamide blend, one kind of polymer is compatibly 
grafted onto others, and filled polymers. In addition, with 
alicyclic polyolefins--ethene tetracyclododecene, for 
example--plastics are available that can be used in engineering 
as high-grade structural materials and special plastics. The new 
polyolefins can be produced with less energy consumption than 
can the typical high-pressure polymers and are halogen-free in 
addition, they say.

"Companies/Research/Technology": "Polymer Films for 
Light-Emitting Diodes"] 
  [Text] Mainz--Teams at Mainz University's Institute for 
Physical Chemistry (Dr. Muhwald, professor, 
Jakob-Welder-Weg 
11, 55 128 Mainz) together with the Racah Institute of Physics 
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem want to develop a new 
class of materials for light-emitting diodes that are to replace 
the semiconductors primarily used thus far. Components made of 
organic materials are of particular interest here. 
  A thin polymer film is to be used for making these 
components. It will be constructed in two or three separate 
layers depending on its functions. This polymer film will be 
between two electrodes made of inorganic materials. The 
charge-transfer and light-emitting substances will be 
synthetically produced. The new kind of thin-film construction 
is to be combined with typical components for system design. At 
the same time systems will be developed by means of which inner 
boundaries can be characterized. Mastery of the structure of 
these boundaries, which are important for transfer processes, is 
a central mission they say. 
  According to the scientists, still more basic research will 
have to follow in order to be able to understand the film 
structures on the molecular scale, changes in them under strong 
current, and their meaning for charge transfer and luminescence. 
The merits of ultrathin films lie in their light weight, their 
pliability and the size of the components that can be made from 
them. Flat viewing screens measuring several square meters are 
being conceived of.

<F P=106> [Article by "re": "Solid-State Reactions Instead of </F>
Precipitation Process"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--The Cermet 
Metallkeramische Werkstoffe GmbH [Cermet Materials, Ltd.] 
company (Hansaring 145-147, 50670 Koln [Cologne]) reports 
that, by applying knowledge from the processing of powders for 
ceramic materials, it has succeeded in producing without waste 
water entirely new types of catalysts having compositions and 
high activities not producible thus far. The new process is 
based on mechanically induced solid-state reactions between the 
oxide powders instead of the joint precipitation of heavy-metal 
oxides from dilute solutions, whereby highly polluted waste 
water results, as well as dust when calcining. 
  In addition, the process presents the capability of 
reactivating spent catalysts. For this purpose the catalysts are 
again subjected to mechanical treatment after the organic refuse 
has been separated, in the process of which it has become 
apparent that fresh catalyst surfaces become available and 
contaminated surfaces are to a large extent cleaned. Specimens 
thus treated display activity almost equal to that of newly 
produced catalysts, it is further reported. 
  The process, for which a patent has been applied for in the 
meantime, can be translated relatively easily to the commercial 
scale, because the plants required for the reaction are to a 
large extent available from other applications. A production 
plant having a daily capacity of a ton and more could also be 
built within a short time. The production costs are much lower 
than with conventional precipitation, the Cermet company 
emphasizes.

<F P=106> [Report by the Microgravity Advisory Committee: "Focused </F>
Sciences Interim Report: Focused Research in the Microgravity 
Programme"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Part 1: Physics, Materials, and Fluid Science </H5>
  The Microgravity Advisory Committee of ESA proposes to 
concentrate the scientific programme in the field of 
microgravity on the most promising research areas with 
outstanding expertise in Europe. Being intended to form the 
foundation for a sound development of this recent field into the 
future, the programme will not be restricted to existing 
knowledge, but is open to new ideas at any time. The present 
paper is limited to physics, materials, and fluid sciences; a 
similar exercise covering life sciences has been initiated. 
<H5>  Results of Previous Experiments </H5>
  Despite the fact that the number of flight opportunities for 
microgravity experiments in the past has been severely limited, 
the results available to-date have had considerable influence on 
the scientific development in the disciplines concerned, 
demonstrated by the large number of scientific papers emerging 
from microgravity-promoted studies. Materials science has 
experienced a dramatic improvement of our general understanding 
of transport processes in crystal growth from space experiments, 
resulting in improvements in ground-based production methods. 
In fluid sciences, detailed phenomena have become observable 
which previously were not accessible due to obscuration by 
buoyancy flow or hydrostatic pressure on Earth. Thermodynamics 
has made considerable progress in understanding transport 
processes in fluids and relaxation effects near the critical 
point. Physical metallurgy has developed a new understanding of 
the interactions at fluid-solid interfaces, and novel insight 
into the behaviour of multicomponent systems. 
  Several major breakthroughs or discoveries can be identified 
in the results available today. Among those are: 
  In the Field of Crystal Growth: 
  -- the new, rapidly growing research field of protein 
crystallisation in space opened by a SL-1 result, which 
generated considerable fundamental and commercial interest, e.g. 
in pharmaceutical industry; 
  -- identification of the relative influence of various 
transport processes on crystal perfection, with subsequent 
improvements in ground- based production techniques, e.g. by 
magnetic field growth; 
  In the Field of Fluid Physics: 
  -- the observation and quantitative measurement of 
bifurcation phenomena in pure Marangoni flow; 
  -- a quantitative understanding of static and dynamic 
stability limits of large liquid interfaces; 
  In the Field of Thermodynamics: 
  -- evidence against the accepted model for diffusion in 
liquid melts, with important implications for metallurgy; 
  -- the first accurate measurement of the Soret effect in 
liquid metals and the observation of isotopic separation through 
a thermal gradient; 
  -- the unexpected observation of critical heat flux in 
boiling being independent of gravity, in contradiction to 
present understanding; 
  In the Field of Critical Point Phenomena: 
  -- the demonstration of a novel thermalization phenomenon 
near the critical point (piston effect); 
  -- the quantitative confirmation of a thermophysical 
divergence in the immediate vicinity of the critical point; 
  In the Field of Metal Physics: 
  -- new insight in physical phenomena at the growth interface 
of metallic materials and in the dynamics of the solidification 
front; 
  -- an improved understanding of phase separation and 
ripening 
processes in immiscible alloys, the results of which are used in 
ground production of bearing materials. 
  One objective of the ESA microgravity programme was a 
critical assessment of the early speculations concerning 
industrial activities in space. Here fundamental scientific 
investigations were used as a basis for judgement. The results 
clearly indicate that, while applications emerged in several 
fields for ground-based industry, no near-term prospects for 
space production have been identified so far. 
<H5>  Science Priorities </H5>
  Leaving aside possible developments in the direction of 
space 
production at the moment, the programme presently concentrates 
on -- fundamental science within existing basic research fields, 
-- application-oriented investigations directed towards 
improvement of ground processing and strengthening of the 
European industry. 
  A high level of excellence is to be ensured by critical peer 
reviews, and by industrial interest where applicable. 
  The present analysis relies on the outcome of the recent 
peer 
review of the Columbus precursor proposals, combined with the 
experience of past results and the preferences in the national 
programmes of European member states. The latter has been 
derived from an ESA paper which forms an element of the future 
development of the programme. The priorities obtained in this 
way are defined in terms of research focuses and individual 
experiments centred around proposals which have received the 
highest rating in the peer review. 
  High-priority research focuses bring together several 
proposals of highest quality, which are expected to benefit from 
the synergy originating from cooperations in topical working 
groups. The following topics were selected in this group (on 
equal level): 
  In the Field of Crystal Growth: 
-- `Crystallisation Mechanisms of Biological Macromolecules' -- 
finding the underlying fundamentals of this successful new 
method; -- `Growth Mechanism and Perfection in Solution and 
Vapour Crystal Growth' -- towards the perfect crystal; 
  Cross Disciplinary Between Crystal Growth and Fluid Physics: 
-- `Convection and Morphological Stability' -- exploiting new 
understanding that originated from earlier microgravity results; 
  In the Field of Fluid Physics: 
-- `Flows and Instabilities Induced by Surface or Thermal 
Radiation Forces' -- investigating fluid dynamics processes 
masked by convection under Earth gravity; -- `Double Diffusive 
Instabilities' -- coupling between heat and mass transfer in 
fluids can be investigated unambiguously under microgravity; 
  In the Field of Thermodynamics: 
-- `Time and Length Scales in Critical Point Phenomena' -- 
following up recent discoveries obtained under low gravity 
conditions; -- `Thermophysical Properties of Fluids' -- 
extending thermodynamics into novel areas like the largely 
inaccessible metastable regime of undercooling; -- `Mechanism of 
Boiling' -- investigating unexpected results with high 
fundamental and technological relevance; 
  Cross Disciplinary Between Materials and Thermodynamics: 
-- `Metastable Phases' -- investigating the fundamentals of the 
formation of novel materials through containerless processing. 
  High-priority individual experiments are defined as 
investigations of scientific excellence proposed by coordinated 
European groups with proven expertise. The following 
experiments were selected (in alphabetical order, with proposing 
institutions in brackets): -- Droplet Combustions (Laboratoire 
de Combustion, Orleans) -- Interfacial Tension and Absorption 
(CNR-ICFAM, Genova) -- Laser Cooling of Atoms (Laboratoire de 
Spectroscopie Hertz, Paris) -- Monotectic Alloys (DLR, Cologne) 
-- Plasma Crystal (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, 
Garching) -- Protoplanetary Dust Aggregation 
(Max-Planck-Institute for Aeronomy, Lindau) 
  ESA is encouraged to advance both types of high-priority 
experiment groups by supporting international cooperation these 
fields within Europe, and by giving priority in the selection of 
flight opportunities and hardware development. For the case of 
high-priority research focuses, it is recommended to establish 
`Topical Working Groups' (TWG's) composed of the investigators 
concerned (essentially those selected as category I in the 
precursor proposals evaluation) as an active means to stimulate 
cooperation. 
  The activities of these working groups shall be reviewed at 
regular intervals. The priority fields shall be updated 
frequently and remain open for extension by new proposals of 
high excellence, and sufficient flexibility should be retained 
to permit the incorporation of new ideas at any time. 
<H5>  Consequences for Flight Opportunities and Programmatics </H5>
  A programme based on the scientific priority elements 
defined 
here, which notably does not yet include life sciences, has 
specific demands on future flight opportunities. It requires a 
wide spectrum of microgravity timescales, ranging from a few 
seconds to several days. Some experiments demand several weeks 
of continuous low gravity. In order to ensure research 
continuity, it is important to avoid large gaps in the sequence 
of operations. The experiments having priority in this part of 
the programme can be performed without human interaction in 
space. However, if astronauts are present, they could 
efficiently handle some of the experiments proposed. Taking 
into account compatibility with the specific scientific 
requirements, the selection of flight opportunities should be 
strictly governed by the criterion of cost efficiency. 
  A number of programmatic consequences and recommendations 
can 
be derived from the present analysis: -- Adequate funds should 
be provided in the framework of the ESA microgravity programme 
to ensure an efficient operation of the high- priority research 
groups defined above. -- ESA should encourage and stimulate new 
scientific and technical research proposals, both solicited and 
unsolicited, which, after careful scrutiny, can be introduced to 
the present programme. -- ESA is advised to extend its efforts 
to study scientific or technical problems, for example by 
initiating science definition studies. -- In view of the 
shortage of funds and of flight opportunities, ESA should use 
its proven ability and expertise to foster closer cooperation 
between national programmes in European member states. -- ESA 
should encourage increasing involvement of scientific 
investigators in hardware development, following the example of 
the science programme. -- Considering the fundamental research 
nature of the programme defined, ESA is advised to seek ways of 
incorporating the microgravity programme into the Agency's 
mandatory activities, in line with the resolution of the Granada 
ministerial council of 10. November 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "The European Biology </F>
Laboratory -- Italy Must Be Given More Importance"] 
  [Text] The conditions of Italy's participation in the 
European Molecular Biology Laboratory [EMBL] in Heidelberg have 
become the cause of a conflict that is dividing our scientific 
community, stirring up opposing initiatives of solidarity and 
objection to the work of University and Research Minister 
Umberto Colombo. 
  It is necessary to provide the background information before 
giving an update on a situation that has become incandescent. 
At the end of December, the Italian Government, at the 
initiative of Minister Colombo, decided to denounce the 
agreement under which our country belongs to the EMBL by 
protesting about the disproportion between our financial 
contribution (16 percent) and the number of Italian researchers 
present in Heidelberg (1 percent). According to the statute a 
member country must give a year's notice of its intention to 
leave. Therefore, if there are no new developments, Italy will 
leave this research organization in January 1995. 
  Prof. Alfonso Maria Liquori, a biochemist, reminded us on 
these same pages (23 January 1994) of the historical roots of 
the Heidelberg laboratory, the benefits that Italian molecular 
biology had gained from it, and the damage that would result if 
Italy should leave. Prof. Riccardo Cortese and other scientists 
who have sent letters of protest to Minister Colombo are of the 
same opinion. "Italy's withdrawal from the EMBL would damage 
both the European scientific community and that of Italy, and in 
particular it would reduce the opportunities for exchanges to be 
made between young Italian researchers and their European 
colleagues." 
<H5>  Intolerable Situation </H5>
  A large part of the biological community opposes these 
vehement requests and expresses appreciation of the action 
launched by Minister Colombo, stressing that this, rather than 
an irreversible abandonment of the Heidelberg laboratory, is the 
only way we can protest against a situation that has now become 
intolerable. ICGEB (International Center for Genetic 
Engineering and Biotechnology) Director Prof. Arturo Falaschi in 
Trieste is a supporter of this position. "The EMBL," explains 
Falaschi, "conducts basic research into molecular biology and in 
particular it deals with the study of viruses, the cell cycle, 
the structure of proteins and the genome. The spin-offs from 
this research can be considerable for the vaccine and 
pharmaceutical industry in general, and for agriculture and food 
production." 
  "The importance of this laboratory for Italy, where nothing 
exists of a comparable size, is not in question," he stressed. 
"What appears to be unacceptable is the continued tolerance of 
the disadvantageous conditions under which Italy is 
participating." Falaschi shows some tables in which the figures 
speak for themselves. In the past few years, out of a total of 
about 300 researchers there have been less than 10 Italians, 
while there have been about 100 Germans, 70 British, and 30 
French. Nevertheless, today Italy is the third supporter of the 
EMBL, after Germany and France, with a contribution of about 10 
million German marks [DM]. 
<H5>  Small Nuclei </H5>
  "I would be the first person to be sorry if Italy were to 
leave the EMBL," confirms Minister Colombo. "Last fall, when 
the president and the managing director of the EMBL visited 
Italy, I expressed unease about the fact that our country, 
despite its contribution of DM9.7 million, was below the quota 
both as far as personnel and scholarships were concerned; and 
because it had not even acquired, like the other major 
contributors, an outstation, that is an important 
EMBL-affiliated center, in its own territory. Therefore, we 
agreed that our proposal to set up about 10 small EMBL research 
nuclei in Italy, at the same number of universities, instead of 
a single outstation, would have been discussed at the next 
council meeting. The council has reduced the offer to just four 
nuclei. This has led to our protest action." 
  The denouncement of the agreement, Colombo persists in 
stressing, has a double function; that of making us stronger in 
the negotiations that we will face to obtain more dignified 
conditions for our country; and that of requesting clarification 
from our researchers, because if the number of our people at 
Heidelberg is small this also depends on internal reasons. "I 
hope," concludes Colombo, "that I will soon be able to announce 
a favorable solution to the crisis."

"Gross Domestic Expenditure On Research &amp; Development 1992"] 
  [Text] 4 Mar -- In 1992, expenditure on Research and 
Development in the UK was 2.12 per cent of gross domestic 
product. 
  In 1992, and compared to 1991: expenditure on R&amp;D in 
the UK 
increased by 4 per cent to 12.6 billion pounds in cash terms; 
expenditure on R&amp;D in the UK was almost unchanged in real 
terms 
  Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (R&amp;D) in 
the UK 
The estimate of the UK's gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D in 
1992 was 12.6 billion pounds compared with 12.2 billion pounds 
in 1991. This represents 2.12 per cent of GDP. 
  R&amp;D expenditure for civil purposes at 10.4 billion 
pounds in 
1992 was 5 per cent higher than the figure for 1991. R&amp;D 
expenditure for defence purposes, at 2.3 billion pounds shows a 
decline of 1 per cent on the 1991 expenditure. 
<H5>  Performers of R&amp;D in the UK </H5>
  The sectors of the economy carrying out this R&amp;D in 
1992 were: 
  --Business enterprises: 7.9 billion pounds compared to 7.8 
billion pounds in 1991. 
  --Government: 2 billion pounds compared to 1.9 billion 
pounds 
in 1991. 
  --Higher education: 2.1 billion pounds compared to 2 billion 
pounds in 1991. 
  --Private non-profit:(mainly medical charities) 0.5 billion 
pounds, very similar to 1991. 
<H5>  Funding of R&amp;D in the UK </H5>
  In 1992 Government funded just over a third of all R&amp;D 
performed in the UK, nearly thirty per cent of the civil R&amp;D 
and 
just under two-thirds of the defence R&amp;D. 
<H5>  Gross Central Government Expenditure On R&amp;D </H5>
  Gross Central Government expenditure on R&amp;D (both 
internal 
and external) in 1992-93 was at 5.4 billion pounds. Of this, 1.7 
billion pounds was spent within Government establishments, the 
remaining 3.7 billion pounds was in support of R&amp;D in other 
sectors in the UK and abroad.

  [Text] Deutsche Bundespost [DPB] Telekom intends its 
ambitious "Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg" project to help Berlin 
win back its status as one of the leading telecommunications 
cities in the world. The ideas that have emerged from the 
Telecommunications 2001 Berlin-Brandenburg land-level initiative 
have also been incorporated into the project, which is initially 
scheduled for conclusion at the end of 1997. It entails 
investments amounting to 8.1 billion German marks [DM], already 
budgeted in DBP Telekom's Eastern Expansion program. DBP 
Telekom has already invested DM6.6 billion in the greater Berlin 
area. 
<H5>  Prestige Project for Germany's Capital </H5>
  Much has already been done in Berlin with a view to 
normalizing telecommunications, but a comparison with other 
world capitals still reveals a considerable shortfall. This is 
particularly so in view of the future telecommunications demands 
that will arise out of Berlin's pivotal position in central 
Europe, where it acts as a hinge between east and west, and out 
of its new role as Germany's capital and seat of parliament and 
government. 
  Even now, greater Berlin, with its population of about 4.3 
million, including 3.6 million in the immediate urban area, is 
already by far the greatest conurbation in Germany, larger than 
the Munich, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart districts. In view of 
this, DBP Telekom has decided to top up its "normal" Eastern 
Expansion program with an extra project going by the name of 
"Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg" to accelerate the expansion of 
telecommunications in the federal capital. Gerd Tenzer, a DBP 
Telekom board member, heads the board committee running the 
project. 
  DBP Telekom wants to demonstrate its love of innovation and 
its efficiency first and foremost in Berlin. The conditions are 
all in its favor. It has about 15,000 employees in the city. 
In addition to operational units (directorates and 
telecommunications exchanges), Berlin is home to major sections 
of DBP Telekom's inhouse Research and Technology Center (FTZ), a 
data processing development center, a DBP Telekom technical 
training college, a management development center for managerial 
staff, and a number of subsidiaries -- e.g., DeTe Berkom, the 
German Trunk Cable Corporation (DFKG), and divisions of German 
Telepost Consulting (DeTeCon). 
  DBP Telekom considers that the additional DM8.1 billion that 
it will invest up to the end of 1997 will be sufficient to 
implement the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project. 
<H5>  Boom in Berlin and Brandenburg </H5>
  The economic structure of the Berlin-Brandenburg area will 
undergo profound changes in the near future: Manufacturing 
companies will increasingly tend to relocate to the outskirts, 
while service industries and administrations will concentrate to 
an even greater extent in the city center. The Berlin city 
planning authority expects about 200,000 new jobs to be created 
within the city boundaries alone. 
  Berlin's status as capital city and seat of government and 
the new importance that this will bestow on the city as an 
economic center will also boost its population. The planning 
authorities in Berlin and Brandenburg expect a 1-million 
population increase over the next 10 to 15 years. This will 
bring the population of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis up to 
over 5 million and make it one of the largest conurbations in 
Europe and the world. 
  A well-developed infrastructure is essential for a 
metropolis 
of this size, and, now more than ever before, this also means 
the telecommunications infrastructure. Berlin's should stand 
comparison with those of world-rank cities, such as Paris, 
London, or New York, i.e., meet international standards. The 
Metropole Berlin- Brandenburg project sets out to create just 
such an infrastructure in greater Berlin within the shortest 
possible time. This massive task cannot be performed using 
standard network tools. 
  Berlin and Brandenburg are merging to form a single economic 
area. New telecommunications services are opening up 
considerable development potential for product quality, 
quantity, and cost- effectiveness in many branches of industry. 
New applications based on metropolitan area networks (MAN's), 
broadband communications, intelligent services, and mobile radio 
are providing opportunities for raising efficiency. Future 
investors in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis, be they the 
Federal Government, multinationals, or even small craft 
enterprises, will have access to a telecommunications 
infrastructure commensurate with their requirements. The 
Berlin- Brandenburg conurbation is on the way to becoming the 
German telecommunications industry's worldwide advertising 
poster. 
<H5>  Digital Technology for Customer-Oriented Network Expansion </H5>
  Over the next few months, work on the project will focus on 
analyzing demand in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolis as closely 
as possible. An initial assessment of potential for Berlin and 
the surrounding areas indicates that, over and above normal 
requirement projections, approximately 1 million extra telephone 
lines are likely to be required up to the turn of the century 
and as many as 1.4 million more by the end of the year 2010. 
  Nowadays, one of the main parameters for evaluating the 
efficiency of a telecommunications network is its degree of 
digitization. In addition to accommodating new services, 
network digitization makes for efficient operation with low 
operating costs. Berlin is lagging way behind other conurbations 
in terms of digitization, so one of the keys to the success of 
the Metropole Berlin-Brandenburg project lies in speeding up the 
digitization process. New technologies such as Opal [optical 
line] (optical fiber systems in the subscriber line sphere), IN 
(intelligent networks), SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy), and 
ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) will also help minimize costs. 
  The medium-term goal is to set up a broadband ISDN 
[integrated services digital network] with optical fiber cables 
and ATM switching systems for voice, data, and image 
transmission at high data rates. The introduction of multimedia 
applications means that broadband communication is acquiring 
increasing importance. Multimedia will substantially modify the 
forms in which business and system customers communicate. The 
relocation of the Federal Government to Berlin and the arrival 
in the area of branches of a multitude of major German and 
foreign companies will further raise requirements and demand in 
this field. 
<H5>  Status of "Telecom 2000" Program </H5>
  Since German unification, 2 million telephone lines and over 
35,000 data lines have been installed in the new federal 
laender. Investments to date, which amount to about DM25 
billion, have secured 100,000 jobs in eastern Germany. Of this 
sum, DM6.6 billion went to greater Berlin, including DM4 billion 
for the city of Berlin itself. Overall, DBP Telekom intends to 
invest about DM60 billion under its Expansion East campaign by 
the end of 1997. A new telecommunications network has been 
created, for which the digital overlay network forms the 
skeleton and which is being fleshed out exclusively with the 
most advanced optical fiber technology. Approximately 4,500 km 
of optical fiber cables have been laid to date, making a total 
of 140,000 km of fibers. Over 35,000 data transmission lines 
have been provided specially for trade and industry. The 
service provided in the new federal laender will be sufficient 
to meet demand by the end of the current year. In the meantime, 
there are 92 telephones per 100 households in eastern Berlin. 
The density in the original federal laender averages out at 112 
telephones per 100 households, whereas the average in the new 
laender is 57. DBP Telekom intends to invest heavily in 
expanding the telecommunications infrastructure in future years 
as well: According to the recently drawn-up medium-term budget 
for 1994-1998, about DM10 billion will be invested this year 
too, DM1.5 billion in Berlin and DM810 million in the 
surrounding area. Plans to the end of 1997 include the 
provision of about 3.5 million more telephone lines, just under 
70,000 data lines, and about 2 million cable lines. The overall 
telecommunications service supply in eastern Germany will then 
be commensurate with demand. 
<H5>  Broadband Communications Between Berlin and Bonn </H5>
  The Berkom [Berlin Communications] Bravo project, which 
centers on telecommunications for the parallel conduct of 
government business in Berlin and Bonn, has now reached the 
trial stage, under which broadband communication between the 
rivers Spree and Rhine is being tried out. The participants in 
this major multimedia field trial are the Federal Chancellery 
and the Federal Press Office, the ministries of Finance (BMF), 
Posts and Telecommunications (BMPT), and the Family and Senior 
Citizens (BMFuS), and the Trust Agency. 
  The multimedia workstations installed in these agencies in 
Bonn and Berlin make it possible, for instance, to conduct 
videoconferences between one desk and another or to draft the 
same document together. This type of communication saves time 
and is effective. Especially since the decision to keep 
sections of the ministries and other bodies in Bonn even after 
the planned move to Berlin, an efficient information link 
between the two cities takes on crucial importance for the 
future. 
  Based on Bravo, DBP Telekom has drawn up a comprehensive 
service strategy for a link of this type and submitted an offer 
to the Federal Minister of the Interior accordingly: The 
"Federal Agencies Network 2000" (BBN 2000). It fulfills two 
main requirements -- the distributed organizational units of the 
federal agencies must be united by telepresence and 
telecooperation facilities, and the agencies' employees must be 
accessible at any time from both inside and outside the BBN, if 
possible via a central phone number, regardless of their 
location. It is thus planned to bring the uppermost federal 
authorities in Berlin and Bonn together under a single, 
nationwide "area" code, thus creating a Federal Government local 
network. BBN 2000 is a corporate network tailored to the 
requirements of the Federal Government as "client.'' The 
service provides much more than an advanced optical fiber 
infrastructure between federal agencies in Berlin and Bonn: In 
addition to the network itself, the concept also incorporates 
the tele- and value- added services required for the information 
link and intelligent network features and services. Special 
network solutions of this type will acquire increasing 
importance in a metropolis like Berlin- Brandenburg.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Office of Public Service and </F>
Science: "Forward With Foresight"] 
  [Text] Science Minister, William Waldegrave today threw 
down the gauntlet to academia and industry to sign up to 
"Technology Foresight" to improve the UK's competitiveness and 
quality of life. 
  Speaking at the launch of the UK Technology Foresight 
Programme, Mr Waldegrave said: 
  "The Technology Foresight Programme provides us all with an 
opportunity to improve the way in which the UK's scientific and 
technological strengths are harnessed to wealth creation and 
improving the quality of life. The Programme can succeed only if 
industry, academia and Government work together to create the 
partnerships and networks which are essential for achieving 
these goals. I can assure you that Government will play its 
part. I look to industry and academia to do the same." 
  At the launch the 15 sectors to be covered by the foresight 
process were announced. Panels of 15-20 people will be appointed 
for each sector to take forward the foresight process. 
  Each panel will be led by a Chairman and Vice Chairman and 
where possible an industrialist will be appointed to one 
position and an academic to the other. Panel Chairmen are 
already being appointed and five were announced today. These 
were: 
  -- Dr David Grant, Director of Technology, GEC [General 
Electric Company] plc will be Chairman of the Manufacturing, 
Production and Business Processes Panel 
  -- Professor John Hillman FRSE, Director, Scottish Crop 
Research Institute will be Chairman of the Agriculture, Natural 
Resources and Environment Panel - Dr John Campbell, Chief 
Technology Officer, Cookson Group plc will be Chairman of the 
Materials Panel - Dr Alan Calder, General Manager R&amp;D, Zeneca 
Specialities will be Chairman of the Chemicals Panel - Mr H 
Nahapiet, John Mowlem plc will be Chairman of the Construction 
Panel. 
  Mr Waldegrave stressed the importance of existing networks, 
such as trade associations, which already conduct specialised 
foresight activities and for the Technology Foresight Programme 
to take advantage of these. 
  Consultation and partnership lies at the heart of the 
foresight process, Mr Waldegrave said - 
  "Technology foresight is a programme which needs to be 
driven 
by the vision of our industrialists and our scientists - a 
programme which they in turn need to own, since many if its key 
benefits - closer working partnerships, better information about 
future opportunities - will be for them to exploit. 
  "For its part, the Government is determined to do all it can 
to involve all sectors involved in the foresight process. Not 
only companies which already have close links with the science 
base. We need to go wider and encourage other companies to 
benefit from our strengths in science and technology." 
  The Technology Foresight Programme is due to report its 
results in early 1995. 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  1. The White Paper, "Realising our Potential: A Strategy for 
Science, Engineering and Technology", announced the Government's 
intention to launch a Technology Foresight Programme. This is a 
means of building a consensus on those generic technologies 
where new developments are likely to yield the greatest economic 
and social benefits to the UK in the long term. The results will 
better inform government and industry in making decisions about 
funding research and development. 
  2. During spring 1994 the sectoral panels will carry out the 
initial foresight work, drawing together existing expertise. A 
preliminary report will then be produced setting out perceived 
market and technological developments in their sectors over the 
next 10-20 years. 
  3. The panels will then consult even wider before the 
Technology Foresight Steering Group will draw together sectoral 
views during the autumn. The Steering Group and panels will then 
assess priorities within and across sectors, taking account of 
the strengths and weaknesses in UK industry, science and 
technology.

  [Text] The duration of the commission that is currently 
governing the Italian Space Agency has been extended. While it 
is under this commission that the agency is being restructured 
to enable it to soon operate with a new leadership, the 
principle guidelines for its activities will be decided by the 
government. The fact that the finance bill did provide 
sufficient funding to allow the ASI [Italian Space Agency] to 
respect all its obligations has meant that some international 
agreements have had to be rediscussed. This anyway comes within 
the general modification of the situation following Russia's 
entry into the space station program. The CIRA, [Italian 
Aerospace Research Center] that was "completely disorganized," 
has also been reorganized and it has been possible to release 
600 billion lire for its operation. However, its role has been 
completely redefined as far as programs are concerned, changing 
its direction toward aeronautical topics with programs that 
decisively favor national industry in the sector to help it 
"participate in new international programs with dignity." 
<H5>  CIRA Funding Released </H5>
  At a press conference held on 11 January, University and 
Scientifical and Technological Research Minister Umberto Colombo 
described those aspects of the document, which he presented to 
the cabinet meeting on 27 December, on "Research for 
Development: Government Lines of Action on Research and 
Innovation Policy," that directly affect aerospace research. As 
well as giving suggestions for the future, the document 
describes the results of the actions that were taken to balance 
the accounts almost a year ago now. 
  The availability of the funds for the CIRA that have finally 
been released is one example of the actions taken by MURST 
[Ministry of Universities and Scientific and Technological 
Research] to compensate for the inadequacy of the resources that 
the country makes available for research, recuperating 
efficiency wherever possible. Colombo stated that: "Through 
improvements obtained by eliminating areas of inefficiency or 
bad management it has been possible to recuperate about 3.3 
trillion lire, this being about 15 percent of the annual funding 
for public research, which in 1993 totaled 23 trillion lire. In 
this way, that is, substantially by demobilizing a mass of 
passive outstanding amounts that are mainly the results of 
burdensome bureaucratic procedures, we have managed to more than 
balance the reduction of 4.5 percent that the finance bill made 
on the budgets for research bodies in 1994. As well as 
providing for the above-mentioned Aerospace Research Center this 
release of funds includes 390 billion lire under Law No. 46 on 
industrial research, 1.5 trillion lire for programs inherited 
from the former Cassa del Mezzogiorno [Extraordinary 
Intervention Fund for Southern Italy], 300 billion lire for 
science and technology parks, and 600 billion lire for national 
research programs into the environment, remote controlled 
medicine, biotechnology, electronic machine tools, 
neurosciences, pharmacy, building and the textile industry. 
<H5>  A Warning From The Minister </H5>
  Colombo warned that although the situation has been remedied 
in this way this year, it will not be possible to do any more. 
Italy must inevitably dedicate greater resources to innovation 
from now on. "It will shortly be necessary to increase the 
resources that are available because the gap separating us from 
the other industrialized countries has now reached an 
intolerable width." 
  It is also necessary to take some action, particularly 
within 
the small and medium-sized industries, to assist the culture of 
technological innovation that is traditionally lacking in Italy 
despite the diffused cult for "noble" science. We are risking 
isolation, not from the most prestigious goals of science, but 
from the benefits that this and leading-edge technologies bring 
to a nation's productive system, and therefore to its economy 
and employment. 
  Colombo placed particular emphasis on this latter point, 
insisting on the basic change in national research policy that 
the document proposes. Strategies should be defined in advance, 
instead of allowing the researchers themselves to indicate the 
goals that should be aimed at generally without any reference to 
the overall interest of the country, as has happened up to now. 
  It is necessary to focus on promoting innovation and its 
rapid application in the productive sectors of the leading 
industrial areas and on promoting advanced technologies that 
have a strong capacity for diffusion. It is also necessary to 
reinforce R&amp;D activities relating to the modernization of the 
infrastructure networks (computer science "but verifying where 
it is really needed," telecommunications, and transport). 
Generally speaking, the sprinkling of interventions that 
Colombo recognizes the validity of for basic research, as far as 
"targeted" research is concerned, should leave the way clear for 
consistent support to be given to the sectors that have an 
assured potential for economic development while an effective 
control of expenditure and results must be guaranteed. 
  Research should be organized to avoid wasting efforts, even 
in sectors of research that have already been widely explored by 
other nations and sectors that have little in common with our 
sectors of "excellence" -- in which manufacturing fields that 
only apparently have little connection with technological 
innovation, such as clothing and food production, must be 
renewed -- and in keeping with the European R&amp;D program, 
which 
was recently approved thanks to Italy's decisive contribution, 
Colombo recalled.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Belgian Breakthrough"] </F>
  [Text] On 22 December 1993, the Research Council [of the 
European Union] agreed in principle to the Fourth Framework 
Programme (1994-1998) for Research and Technological 
Development. This decision has paved the way for a Common 
Agreement which, at the time of writing, was imminent. Under 
the co-decision-making process resulting from the Maastricht 
Treaty, the European Parliament must give its agreement to the 
Council's decision in order that the Fourth Framework will 
become a legal reality. 
  The Belgian Presidency can be satisfied that it has, by and 
large, ensured agreement on the new research programme under its 
Presidency. This was its declared aim as far as R&amp;D was 
concerned. 
  The significance of the achievement can be judged by the 
budget agreed to which, at 12 billion ECUs, comes close enough 
to the Commission's proposed budget of 13.1 billion ECUs. In 
addition, the terms of the Council Agreement also provides for 
an assessment, by 30 June 1996 at the latest, to determine 
whether an extra one billion ECUs can be provided, depending on 
prevailing economic and other circumstances at that time. This 
formed the basis of the compromise engineered by the Belgians. 
  The Ministers also agreed on a formula for sharing the 
overall budget out among the different activities and specific 
programmes. They also agreed to a budget of 875 million ECUs for 
the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The Commission's original 
proposal called for just over one billion ECUs. The issue of 
how much of the JRC's work should be exposed to open competition 
was however left undecided. 
  The Presidency advocated a figure of 16.5 percent while 
Antonio Ruberti, the EC Commissioner for Research, favoured 
something of the order of 17-20 percent. He thought that 
exposing the JRC to the open market was positive, believing that 
it would improve the standard of its work and promote 
cooperation with other European research laboratories. 
  The Ministers essentially stood by the agreement taken at 
the 
Summit meeting of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels 
on 10-11 December, which made provision for a budget of 12 
billion ECUs which could be raised to 13 billion ECUs by means 
of the reserve fund. 
  In principle then, 5.9 billion ECUs should be available 
between 1994-1996, with the remainder, 6.1 billion ECUs set 
aside for 1997-1998. 
  Regarding the sharing out of the Framework's budget, 
Ministers have increased the amount for the research programmes 
(activity 1) by 0.5 percent. This has been drawn from activity 
4 (international cooperation). 0.5 percent has also been added 
to the energy research programme, most of this being used to pay 
for carrying out inspection work at nuclear power plants in 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
  Information technologies/communications has been increased 
from 15.65 percent to 16.10 percent; however, that for 
communications technologies has been reduced from 5.70 percent 
to 5.25 percent. Life Sciences: The sum for biomedical research 
has been cut by 0.10 percent, benefitting agriculture and 
fisheries research, which has had its budget increased from 5.6 
percent to 5.7 percent. 
  Energy: The percentage for non-nuclear energy has been 
increased from 8 to 8.2 percent as well as the percentage 
intended to improve safety conditions for nuclear fission (from 
3.15 to 3.45 percent). 
  The Fourth Framework is divided up into four areas of 
activity: 
  -- First Activity (Research, Technological Development and 
Demonstration Programmes); 
  -- Second Activity (Cooperation with Third Countries and 
International Organisations); 
  -- Third Activity (Dissemination and Application of 
Results); 
  -- Fourth Activity (Stimulation of the Training and Mobility 
of Researchers).

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Rich: "Take Your Partners, Please"] </F>
  [Text] Russia is attempting to salvage something of the 
high-energy physics programme that it inherited from the Soviet 
Union, with more than a little help from its foreign friends. 
At the end of October, a new scientific and technological 
cooperation agreement was signed by Russia's science minister 
Boris Saltykov and Carlo Rubbia, the then director-general of 
the CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research] European 
particle physics laboratory. 
  The agreement, CERN officials stress, is essentially an 
umbrella one, with no specific commitment to any particular 
research effort. It aims rather at providing a "reasonable" 
(three-year) transition period for developing relations between 
CERN and the Russian Federation, with the ultimate goal of the 
latter becoming a full member of CERN. But the place of the 
signing was significant - the Institute of High Energy Physics 
at Protvino, near Moscow. 
  Protvino, a typical example of the "big science" beloved by 
Soviet planners and propagandists, was originally intended to 
possess a 3000 GeV [giga electron volt] accelerator. But even 
before the Soviet Union fell apart two years ago, construction 
work was at a standstill and plans had been scaled down to a 600 
GeV device. 
  Now CERN is discussing a possible cooperation programme, 
working in an energy range now available on accelerators 
elsewhere. The lower-energy device will provide a useful 
test-beam for gas targets. Indeed, the Protvino scientists are 
already planning such a joint project with the United States, 
but it is a far cry from the grandiose visions of Protvino's 
original plans. 
  The problem with Russia's "big" physics is not simply one of 
money. Western rescue funds are available, and a CERN-Protvino 
project is, as PHYSICS WORLD goes to press, currently awaiting 
approval from the INTAL foundation where, admittedly, it is 
competing against over 7000 other applications. 
  There is also an ideological factor. "Science" was for 
decades hailed by communist theorists as the basis of the Soviet 
system; there has now been a backlash of public opinion against 
science and science spending. Privatization, rather than 
science, is widely seen as the avenue to prosperity, and 
interest in "pseudo-science" is growing. 
  Even if Russia had unlimited funds, the government might 
well 
find it difficult to justify a major commitment to science. For 
a country near bankruptcy, it is well nigh impossible. Yet 
scientists at thousands of research institutes have to be paid. 
And such is the confusion in the entire science sector that 
even Saltykov is in no position to make an unequivocal decision 
about the future of so costly an institution as Protvino. 
  Saltykov, however, does not control all Russian science. The 
Serpukhov nuclear facility, for example, still belongs to the 
ministry of nuclear energy. There is a long-standing division 
of competence between the science minister and the Academy of 
Sciences, and one of the most important research facilities the 
Dubna Joint Institute of Nuclear Research, is, strictly 
speaking, an international rather than a Russian facility. 
  Dubna belonged to Comecon (the socialist-bloc equivalent of 
the EC), which no longer exists. One of its former members, 
Hungary, quit Dubna when it joined CERN in 1990. The other 
remain members formally but can contribute little financially. 
(Paradoxically the late German Democratic Republic still 
continues to provide finance: the new united Germany, although 
formally only an "observer", has made a financial commitment.) 
  Under these circumstances, Russia is left to pay - or leave 
unpaid - the bills. In November, deputy premier Yegor Gaidar 
instructed finance minister Boris Bedorov to find additional 
funding for Dubna - although from where was not made clear. 
  International cooperation in science is now seen by the 
Russians as a vital, and perhaps the only, lifeline. It is not 
a one-way process. CERN would like to transfer to Protvino a 
number of experiments which cannot conveniently be continued at 
its own facilities. And cooperation need not be only bilateral. 
In spite of Russia's claim to be the legal heir of the Soviet 
Union, other newly independent states have inherited part of the 
ex-Soviet scientific workforce -- in many cases, with nowhere 
for them to work because the laboratories are in Russia. 
  Now the academies of sciences of the successor republics are 
discussing joint research, and an institutional framework for 
cooperation is being negotiated. Everything depends on Western 
funding. But there seems no reason why a Western commitment to 
bail out the scientific workforce of, say, Belarus or Armenia, 
should not include supporting scientists from those countries at 
Protvino or Dubna.

Science: "15.4 Million Pounds For New Programmes Including New 
Award Scheme"] 
  [Text] The allocations to the Research Councils send out 
the clear message that the Government is implementing the main 
thrust of the science White Paper in directing research and 
postgraduate training towards wealth creation and better quality 
of life, science Minister William Waldegrave said today. 
  Opening the debate on the restructuring of the Research 
Councils in the House of Commons, Mr Waldegrave announced that 
15.4 million pounds, derived from additional funds and 
reallocated resources, will be made available to "demonstrate 
our commitment to the new partnership between the Research 
Councils and industry." 
  The 15.4 million pounds will be used for a number of 
initiatives including: 
  -- a new competitive scheme to encourage researchers to 
collaborate with industry. The grants will be complementary to 
the funding provided by industry for strategic research. A small 
pilot scheme will be run with funding of 3.5 million pounds in 
1994-95. The awards will be named ROPAs after the White Paper, 
"Realising our Potential". The pilot will be coordinated and run 
by three Research Councils - the Engineering and Physical 
Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Biotechnology and 
Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) 
  -- an additional 0.6 million pounds to the CASE Awards 
available to firms which have demonstrated their ability to 
provide the right environment for postgraduate training in the 
past 
  -- priority in the distribution of research funds to areas 
identified by industry as being of strategic importance. For 
example 2 million pounds to the innovative manufacturing 
programme, 3.4 million pounds to the human and animal genome and 
immunology programmes and 4.5 million pounds to chemistry. 
  Commenting on the new ROPA scheme Mr Waldegrave said: "The 
unique feature of this scheme is that the conventional peer 
review system will not be used but industry's recognition of the 
researchers will be taken as an indicator of quality and 
relevance. It gives industry a major role in identifying the 
researchers, who will be eligible to apply for support for 
strategic research." 
  Mr Waldegrave concluded by emphasising the importance 
partnership will play in taking forward the policies of the 
science White Paper: 
  "Government took a strategic look at what scientific 
research 
and postgraduate training it should fund. And Government has 
resolved to build on existing strengths to create a closer and 
more systematic relationship with the science and engineering 
base, industry and commerce. 
  "The new initiatives I have announced today will go a long 
way to furthering those objectives. I congratulate Sir John 
Cadogan, the new Director General of Research Councils on the 
imaginative programme he has designed." 
  Detailed allocations to the Research Councils were announced 
today by Mr Waldegrave in reply to a parliamentary question from 
Cheryl Gillan MP, (Chesham and Amersham). 
  Mr Waldegrave also placed in the Library of the House a 
paper 
setting out in more detail the allocation of the 15.4 million 
pounds to new programmes.

<F P=106> [Article by J.P.C.: "Minister of Defense Wants To Make up </F>
for Rafale Delays;" introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] Francois Leotard wants to include money in the 
next Military Planning Law to make up for delays in the Rafale 
program. 
  Last Saturday, while coming down the accommodation ladder 
from the Rafale B01 on which he had just spent nearly an hour in 
the air, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard took pains to 
reassure the Air Force, which is worried about delays in the 
Rafale program. He announced that the next planning law, 
covering the period from 1994 to 2000 and due to be submitted to 
Parliament at its spring session, would provide funds for 
bringing the Rafale program up to date. 
  He also confirmed that he had decided to release the 
purchase 
orders covering 37 Mirage 2000-5's for the Air Force. Their 
delivery will begin at the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997. 
That decision is borne out by Jacques Vedel, director of 
aeronautical construction, who has just officially announced 
those contracts, which have an estimated value of from 4 billion 
to 5 billion francs. This project for modernizing the existing 
Mirage 2000's (replacing their radars with RDY radars and 
improving their countermeasures) will reduce the losses suffered 
by manufacturers due to delays with the Rafale (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS 
No. 1449) and enable the pilots to hold out until the Rafales 
arrive in their units. 
  Following his 55-minute flight, the minister found it hard 
to 
conceal his satisfaction. "It is a wonderful aircraft that seems 
very simple to pilot," he said. "One feels as safe there as one 
does in one of Air Inter's Airbus aircraft." With Captain 
Philippe Rebourg, a Rafale test pilot at the Flight Test Center 
(CEV), as his pilot, the minister got a general idea of the 
aircraft's flight characteristics as it flew at sharp angles of 
incidence, engaged in supersonic flight at Mach 1.4, and then 
made a pass at low-altitude (2,000 meters) over the town of 
Frejus, where he is mayor. Although this 59th test flight by the 
Rafale B01 was somewhat out of the ordinary, it was nevertheless 
followed from the real-time test control center at Istres by 
Marc Tourtoulon, the engineer responsible for the Rafale at 
Istres. 
  Francois Leotard's flight at Istres marks the second visit 
by 
the minister of defense to the test base headed by Francois 
Naville. He was also able to assess the Rafale's flight 
characteristics last 17 May, but on that occasion he did so only 
through a simulator. This time he went all the way by actually 
flying on the B01. The flight was rated exceptional by Weapons 
Inspector General Herve Groualle, director of the CEV. "To my 
knowledge, this is the first time that a minister has flown on a 
prototype fighter aircraft with scarcely 50 flying hours to its 
credit," he said. "That is additional proof that the program is 
progressing smoothly." Francois Leotard also acknowledged his 
admiration for the links in "the chain that developed this 
aircraft: the DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], the CEV, the 
manufacturers, and the military who have achieved one of French 
industry's finest successes." 
  Actually, the minister had not come to Istres solely to fly 
on the Rafale. He also wanted to convey a message of confidence 
in and support for the manufacturers present for the occasion: 
Serge Dassault, president of Dassault Aviation and Gifas; Gerard 
Renon, president-chief executive officer of Snecma; and Noel 
Forgeard, president-chief executive officer of Matra Defense. 
"The reason I am taking this step is that I believe in this 
program and want to show my belief to those outside France," he 
said, reaffirming the fact that providing political support for 
French export products is part of his job as a minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Arms: How To </F>
Survive"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The General Commissariat to the Plan proposes 
various scenarios and solutions. 
  The industrial strategy group chaired by the ONERA [National 
Office for Aerospace Studies and Research] president, government 
general inspector Marcel Benichou, handed over its report, "The 
Future of Industry-Related Industries," prepared at the request 
of the General Commissariat to the Plan. For one year, some 60 
professionals of all kinds (government officials, manufacturers, 
union members, etc.) worked in groups on seven different themes. 
They thus worked out various strategic choices designed to adapt 
the French defense industry, which has already lost 25 percent 
of its personnel, to the geostrategic new deal. These choices 
should also enable it to go through the crisis without excessive 
damage. 
  In the 244-page report, the group recalled the assets of the 
industry: the human potential represented by 230,000 direct jobs 
(plus 100,000 indirect jobs), a technological base, and first 
rate material resources. Its survival, they wrote, will require 
restructuring companies, making them powerful and able to 
export, and "mastering access to European markets." The latter 
will involve integrating the defense branch (which is not 
covered by the Rome Treaty) into the European Market, and 
adopting pragmatic rules for community exchanges together with a 
policy of reciprocity toward U.S. protectionism, rather than 
generalized "European preference." To ensure the survival of 
French defense industries, Marcel Benichou's group recommended 
adapting them along five lines: 


    -  Restructuring the industrial plant to make it fit the 
demand; the balance thus achieved might be as much as one-third 
lower than it was in the eighties, depending on the scenario 
considered: that would mean losing from 59,000 to 131,000 jobs 
(see table page 7 [not reproduced]). However, Marcel Benichou 
believes that prime contractors must retain their full design 
and engineering capacities in the subsectors preserved and still 
provide adequate workloads to their subcontractors, while 
subcontractors have to diversify into non-defense industries. 
Finally, the report recommends the creation of an 
interministerial fund to help small to mid-size companies and 
industries survive. 
  -  Accelerating the search for a new cooperation framework while 
eliminating the perverse effects of cooperation, such as 
administrative red tape and the law of "just return." 
Cooperation agreements should evolve toward capitalistic groups 
(the economic interest group setup is no longer adequate) and 
the integration of technological, industrial, and marketing 
resources into competitive groups. In addition, the creation of 
a European Arms Agency will make it possible to organize 
research, exploratory developments, testing centers, and 
programs on a European scale. 
  -  Rationalizing budget expenditures: for governments, this will 
mean adopting longer-term military programming laws and adhering 
to them more closely (even if they have to be revised halfway 
through); respecting program implementation schedules by 
avoiding costly delays and the simultaneous launching of many 
programs; and revising the bylaws of nationalized companies (or 
arsenals), which hinder management flexibility and marketing 
dynamism. 
  -  Technological adaptation: it will have to include increased 
consultation between civil and military departments and 
manufacturers, through technological groups set up to prepare 
sectorial plans and an advisory committee in charge of 
summarizing these plans. The report also identifies 24 
technological sectors of critical importance for the future. 
Eight of these are top priorities and require full independence 
at French level: the nuclear sector, structural materials 
(including composites) and their implementation processes, 
micro- and nano-electronic components, propulsion systems, 
navigation equipment, signal detection and processing, mastery 
of signature and stealth-related technologies, and mastery of 
complex systems. Another ten are intermediate priorities and 
could be shared with WEU [Western European Union] countries, and 
the last six are lesser priorities and could be shared with 
non-WEU countries. 
  -  Improved marketing: this will require faster government 
decision-making and greater use of military resources for 
promotional purposes. Manufacturers should improve after-sales 
service by making greater use of government networks abroad. 
Finally, the report recommends the creation (by the government 
or by the industry) of a body responsible for training future 
industry or government agents.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Agreement on ESA Manned </F>
Flight Projects"; Subhead: "Last Minute French-German Agreement 
Resolved Crisis and Enable Agreement in Principle on Manned 
Flight Programs, Commitment to Which Depends Only on Adjusting 
Spain's and Italy's Contributions"] 
  [Text] There was a pleasant surprise on 18 January at the 
second session of the European Space Agency [ESA] that had 
broken up in mid-December over a disagreement based on a 
tactless letter from German research minister, Paul Krueger, 
that entirely smacked of being an ultimatum to the French space 
minister, Gerard Longuet. Since then the tension has eased and 
the new French-German agreement has therefore made it possible 
to break the deadlock and with other relevant European member 
states arrive at a comprehensive agreement on both the tenor and 
the cost of the two new ESA manned system programs. 
  Those are the Columbus (with the attached APM pressurized 
module, the Eureca satellite, the external platform type 
supplements, aiming instrument, remote manipulator arm and two 
Mir 94-95 flights) and MSTP (with manned CTV ballistic capsule, 
automatic ATV orbital tower and ARC test flight, external remote 
manipulator and EVA spacesuit). By 31 March both those programs, 
moreover, are supposed to be merged into a single program, by 
combining the Columbus and MSTP programs, hitherto directed 
respectively by Sweden's Frederik Engstroem and Germany's Jorg 
Feustel-Buechl, into a single entity under a single authority 
(to be defined). The polar platform (formerly in Columbus) was 
already reassigned (more logically) to the ESA observation 
program. 
  An agreement was also reached on the budget of the two 
programs, with 270.4 million units of account [UA] (FF1,780 
million) for Columbus and UA207 million (FF1,363 million) for 
the MSTP, that is, a total budget of more than FF3 billion for 
European manned programs in 1994-1995. 
  In mid-January the member states, however, did not vote on 
those new programs whose committal texts (declarations) should 
be approved and submitted for the signature of the participants 
on 31 January. By then, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, 
Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden will be ready to 
participate in both activities with, in addition, the United 
Kingdom for Columbus and also Switzerland and Canada for MSTP. 
  The only obstacle to be eliminated before the end of the 
month involves adjusting Spain's and Italy's contributions 
(because of the devaluation of their currencies they are forced 
to pay more to the ESA). A compromise is expected to be found by 
31 January to adjust their quota and finally make it possible to 
commit to the Columbus and MSTP programs by the end of 1995.

<F P=106> [Article: "German Aerospace Industry Mobilizing"] </F>
  [Text] In an open discussion organized by Dr. R. Gohner, 
coordinator of the German aerospace sector, Harmut Mehdorn (DASA 
[Deutsche Aerospace]) proposed a 10-point plan for German 
industry. 
  The German aerospace industry has redoubled efforts in 
recent 
months to reaffirm its identity and its spearhead role in 
Germany's future. Its voice is beginning to be heard, as 
evidenced at the forum last Monday at Petersberg in Konigswinter 
held at the initiative of Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary 
for aerospace sector coordination. 
  Dr. Gohner discussed the eight-point program that he had 
announced last October with a view to preserving the competitive 
potential of the industry, which he noted has been the 
beneficiary of government aid totaling an estimated 10 billion 
German marks [DM]. 
  Dr. Wolfgang Piller, president of BDLI, argued brilliantly 
for Germany's need to retain a significant presence in the 
aerospace sector if the country wants to keep its current 
exemplary level of economic and social development. He noted 
that the United States and Japan provide effective support for 
their aerospace firms, recognizing the great importance of the 
latter in helping maintain a strategic global position. 
Aerospace is an especially good field for Europeans because it 
lends itself so well to industrial cooperation. This is 
demonstrated for example by Airbus Industrie group, with DASA 
just recently having proven its value again by meeting the 
production deadline for the A321, which Deutsche Lufthansa is 
putting into service within the next few days. Indeed, no major 
country's economy can afford to do without a "stimulant" like 
the aerospace industry. "If we neglect this sector, it will be 
others who decide our future for us," Dr. Piller concluded. 
  Another speaker was the president of Deutsche Lufthansa, Dr. 
Jurgen Weber. Attendees were particularly keen to hear Dr. 
Weber's remarks at this critical economic juncture, when the air 
transport industry as a whole has lost $14 billion over the last 
4 years. Weber does not expect orders to pick up substantially 
before the second half of the decade. 
  Discussing the contribution air transport operators have 
made to the industry--"without Deutsche Lufthansa and Air 
France, there would be no Airbus Industrie"--he appealed to 
aircraft makers for reciprocity. He called on all the airlines' 
partners, including the airports, to cooperate with the airlines 
on cost-cutting measures, because "the worst is still ahead of 
us, and competition will get even tougher. Improvement can come 
only over the longer term, when the air transport industry comes 
to its senses." 
<H5>  Mehdorn Plan </H5>
  Harmut Mehdorn, who heads DASA's aeronautics division, told 
attendees at the forum, which focused heavily on the manufacture 
of civilian and space aeronautics equipment, that military 
aircraft building is still the economic foundation of the 
aerospace industry. He laid out a 10-point plan for surmounting 
"the most serious crisis the industry has faced since the years 
just after the war [World War II]." For German industry to be 
able to retain its competitiveness, Mehdorn is asking annual 
appropriations of DM300-340 for the sector (including 
helicopters and equipment but not engines) and an equal amount 
of supplementary assistance, analogous to NASA disbursements. 
Such aid is indispensable for meeting competition from Boeing 
and compensating for the increased aid funneled to industries in 
the United States, Japan, and Asian and the CEI [Commonwealth of 
Independent States] countries. Mehdorn also calls for early 
finalization of the proposed FLA [Future Large Aircraft] 
military air transport and immediate allocation of a DM25 
million per year aid package to promote technologies associated 
with the project. He demands confirmation of the Eurofighter 
2000 project and faster transfer to industry of maintenance 
responsibilities for military aircraft. Support is also needed 
for technology projects and demonstrators that respond to needs 
in the marketplace. Conditions must be created within the GATT 
framework that enable the industry to withstand global 
competition. Finally, budgetary appropriations are needed for 
cooperation with the CEI countries. Better coordination of 
research investments with major professional colleges, research 
centers, and the university is indispensable. Lastly, a policy 
of stronger support for marketing activities, comparable to the 
practice in other countries, is necessary. And Mehdorn reminded 
the audience of President Clinton's commitment to Boeing. 
  Dr. Reinhard Gohner, state secretary for the German 
aerospace 
sector, personally conducted this discussion with industry 
representatives from start to finish--in part to show government 
goodwill toward the sector but probably also to offset the 
disastrous impact of statements made by some of his colleagues, 
such as Messrs. Ruhe (Defense) and Kruger (Research). He 
constantly laid stress, as did most other participants, on the 
need to put development of German industry systematically into a 
European perspective--and above all a Franco-German perspective. 
Dr. Gohner called on the industry to submit a list of aerospace 
projects for which state support would be required. But he 
warned that new investment outlays cannot be expected before the 
1995 budget, since the 1994 budget is already overloaded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Francois Fillon, Minister for Higher </F>
Education and Research, by Patrick Piernaz and Pierre Langereux; 
place and date not given: "Fillon Says Aeronautic Industry Can 
Be Supported by Upstream Research"] 
  [Text] [Piernaz/Langereux] The system of reimbursable 
advances practiced by our country and our European partners to 
support major aeronautics programs is coming under increasing 
attack from our trading partners. Would it be easy to substitute 
some other system? 
  [Fillon] Yes. It is possible to support aeronautical 
development either by assistance to upstream research or by 
indirect aid, as the United States is currently doing. Past 
agreements allow us to finance up to 3 percent of a program's 
cost through aid to research. Today we are averaging only 0.8 
percent, so there is a lot of room to expand. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] But are we in fact prepared to augment 
that contribution? 
  [Fillon] Absolutely! And I would remind you that our budget 
for 1994 is going to augment appropriations for upstream 
research by 25 percent. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Aeronautical manufacturers dispute the 
importance of that augmentation, because (they say) you're 
starting from a very low level, so the 25 percent increase will 
not amount to much. What is your response? 
  [Fillon] My answer is, they are right about the size of the 
appropriation being modest. But no one should imagine that all 
the aid is going to be transferred from one day to the next into 
upstream research credits. Our objective is to augment these 
appropriations gradually and to do so in such a way that the 
overall volume of aid utilizable by the enterprises remains 
comparable. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Who is going to receive this new aid to 
upstream research? 
  [Fillon] This is one of our concerns. In fact, apart from 
ONERA [National Officer for Aerospace Studies and Research], 
there are few public-sector research entities specializing in 
aeronautics. At the moment, many contracts are signed directly 
with the enterprises. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you favor a sort of European NASA 
that 
would administer and direct a policy of upstream research? 
  [Fillon] No, I don't think such a cumbersome entity would be 
the best instrument for conducting a voluntarist policy. A 
European system would require negotiations between 12 parties, 
each with its own special interests. Speaking generally, I don't 
think the creation of big public-sector organisms would be 
responsive to the problem. These questions are the subject of 
frequent meetings between the enterprises and government offices 
concerned, and I think we will find flexible and effective 
solutions. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Doesn't the solution lie in support for 
military programs that would have civilian spin-offs? 
  [Fillon] Certainly. And the proposed European military 
transport aircraft presents the opportunity for a great deal of 
cooperation and synergy between military and civilian research. 
Military research organs are asking for closer cooperation with 
civilians in dual-use technologies, which are more numerous than 
I once thought. You must realize that the defense industry 
consumes 30 percent of the country's research outlays while 
accounting for only 5 percent of its production. It's clear that 
our civilian industries must make better use of the 30 percent 
earmarked for military research. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] How do you and the minister for industry 
handle the division of responsibilities for the space domain? 
  [Fillon] In general, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet (Cf. 
A&amp;C No. 1453) has the lead in space affairs. But the 
financing 
for CNES [National Center for Space Studies] of course comes out 
of the Research Ministry's budget. In addition, I pay special 
attention to the scientific program and to research and 
technology activities. 
  In particular, programs for manned space flight should 
occupy 
a place compatible with our means and objectives, and consistent 
with our concept of France's role in space. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] So you support the idea of French, or 
rather European, participation in the new manned flight programs? 
  [Fillon] Yes, because it would be a serious mistake to let 
the Americans and Russians be the only ones to send men into 
space to do things. In my opinion, absenting ourselves from this 
activity so essential for the future is unacceptable! 
  France and Europe should be major partners of the United 
States and Russia in manned systems. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you think your view is widely shared 
in Europe? 
  [Fillon] I think so. The subject came up recently at the G-7 
meeting... I concluded that the Europeans were on the same 
wavelength. And I noted they were in agreement in criticizing 
the Americans for their attitude of deciding without consulting 
with their partners--presenting Europeans with a fait accompli 
on Russian participation in the "international" Space Station 
project. Japan, like Europe, is wondering whether this new 
version of the project is going to be NASA's last. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] What's the status of the Franco-German 
dialogue on the subject? 
  [Fillon] Unlike France, which is one of the few countries in 
Europe whose research budget is increasing despite the economic 
recession, Germany is being forced to accept very difficult 
budget cuts... 
  The Germans are thus confronted with difficult choices. But 
above all, they're proposing adoption of a concept of the manned 
flight program that we believe needs revision to take account of 
developments in the Russo-American discussions. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Here in France, what kind of 
governmental 
support does the plan have? 
  [Fillon] The prime minister has asked us to prepare an 
interministerial council sometime in the first half of 1994 to 
redefine France's position on all these space issues: That's 
when Gerard Longuet will be able to move things forward. 
  [Piernaz/Langereux] Will there be a national debate on the 
subject? 
  [Fillon] Yes. A debate in Parliament on the overall 
directions of France's science policy, including space, is 
planned for June 1994.

  [Text] The international value-added services market is 
growing around a new supplier of services. After the 
Worldsource consortium led by AT&amp;T, the Unisource alliance 
formed by the Netherlands, Swiss, and Swedish telecom 
organizations, and the pact between BT [British Telecom] (UK) 
and MCI (United States), DBP [Deutsche Bundespost] Telekom and 
France Telecom announced another alliance in Brussels last 
month. Subject to the approval of the European Union -- 
expected this spring -- a joint venture with ECU1 billion 
working capital and headquarters in Brussels will be formed 
employing 4,000 people. The corporation will be owned on an 
equal- shares basis and will incorporate only those divisions of 
the parent companies that are already working under competitive 
conditions. It will thus comprise a value-added data service 
network (without voice transmission) for major clients' 
commercial, cross-border communications; a European backbone 
network will become the core of the VANS [value-added network 
service] network. DBP Telekom and France Telecom estimate that 
they already have a 10-percent share of their target market, 
which they intend to build up rapidly on an international basis. 
For this they will need a strong overseas partner, and AT&amp;T's 
assent is hoped for. This would create a consortium of the 
three largest telecom operating organizations in the world. The 
prospect is already arousing skeptical comment in the United 
Kingdom, where it is feared that DBP Telekom and France Telecom, 
which are still state-owned, will distort competition in this, 
to date, largely market-led sector. There is also a "vision," 
says DBP Telekom chief Helmut Ricke, of a subsequent 
interlinking of capital between DBP Telekom and France Telecom. 
The alliance may at least be seen as a further step forward in 
the long-standing collaboration between the two corporations, 
which looks set to continue.

<F P=106> [Article by T. O.: Network Interconnections: Cisco-IBM </F>
Agreement"] 
  [Text] Cisco is offering an IBM channel attachment card for 
its Model 7000 router, that includes emulation of the 3172 
network controller. Developed together with IBM's Mainframes 
Division, this card together with the 7000 router eliminates the 
need for a 3745 front-end computer, the operating cost of which 
still brings shudders to the users of the 50,000 type 3270 
systems in service throughout the world. 
  The new Cisco card is immediately available and is expected 
to improve routing performance--between a TCP/IP network and 
[IBM's] SNA [Systems Network Architecture] protocol, for 
example--but still without providing SNA type PU 4 routing, 
which the 3745 is equipped to do. This function will become 
available only with support of APPN's, expected by the end of 
next year on the 7000. 
  This apparent allegiance on the part of IBM (if one 
considers 
that it could be prejudicing the success of its own routers) is 
backed by an agreement between Cisco and IBM's Maintenance 
Division providing for the installation of routers equipped in 
the United States. This agreement, which is to take on worldwide 
scoop very soon, will constitute a not inconsequential trump 
card for Cisco in the duel to the bitter end that its 7000 
router is waging against Wellfleet's Backbone Node. 
  This is not the first time that a supplier of routers has 
offered a direct "attachment" to an IBM mainframe. Network 
Systems has been offering one on its Model 6800 for the past six 
months. But it is the first time that IBM has manufactured an 
Escon card (136 Mbits/sec fiber-optic link) in cooperation with 
one of its most direct competitors in the routing sector. Marc 
Essinger, of IBM's Communications Service, says it is in keeping 
with Big Blue's most recent decisions, and that it means: 
"Furnishing an immediate solution to its clients, even if it 
appears, a priori, to prejudice the company's own interests." 
Two suppliers of concentrators--Cabletron and Chipcom--are also 
expected to announce "channel" links to improve the offering of 
mainframe/local network connections. Chipcom supplies the basic 
components of IBM's 8750 router.

<F P=106> [Article by P.L.: "1994: Year of Merger Among European </F>
Missile Manufacturers"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] Both teams are making preparations 
simultaneously for French-British and French-German 
regroupings--which are then expected to merge. 
  Discussing the merger of missile activities by Matra Defense 
and British Aerospace [BAe] Dynamics, Noel Forgeard, 
Matra-Hachette's general manager in charge of defense and space 
and chief executive officer of Matra Defense, writes in the 
group's in-house newspaper that "detailed talks between the 
teams are making progress, with both sides showing a desire to 
conclude the discussions as soon as possible in 1994." 
  According to Forgeard, "it is very desirable that the 
resulting Matra-BAe (missile) company be joined by Aerospatiale 
and Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], and it is very likely that that 
will happen in the medium term." 
  For the time being, the French-German team is continuing its 
separate efforts to merge the missile activities of those two 
firms in a new company that may be called Euromissile, thus 
retaining the name of the current consortium. But this is not 
certain, since the two companies have asked for in-house 
suggestions regarding a less "Euro" name! 
  What is certain, on the other hand, is that the merger of 
missile activities by Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace is in 
the final stretch. Officials met in Munich before Christmas to 
finalize their communication strategy with a view to an upcoming 
announcement regarding the new French-German missile company 
formed by Aerospatiale and DASA. 
  It is therefore likely that we will see the simultaneous 
regrouping of Matra-BAe and Aerospatiale and DASA in 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by P.L.: "Aerospatiale-DASA Satellite and Missile </F>
Partnership"] 
  [Text] The inter-union association at Aerospatial's Cannes 
facility is worried about company plans to form a "joint 
subsidiary" for satellites with Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], while 
a partnership agreement between the two firms in the missile 
domain is "approaching closure." 
  Currently in the discussion phase, a possible partnership in 
the satellite domain between Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace 
is stirring intense anxiety in the trade unions at the 
Aerospatiale plant in Cannes (Cote d'Azur). In an unusual 
gesture on 14 January, the inter-union issued a joint communique 
on the subject signed by FO [Workers Force], CFE/CGC, CGT 
[General Confederation of Labor], and CFDT [French Democratic 
Labor Confederation]. 
  The Cannes inter-union--with the support, it claims, of 
unions at the other facilities in Mureaux and 
Aquitaine--"opposes the creation of a joint company" to 
integrate the space activities, especially the satellite 
activities, of Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace; it also 
opposes what it terms "subsidiarization of the Cannes facility." 
The unions believe such a move would be "the first step towards 
loss of human, technological, and material patrimony" along with 
"loss of Aerospatiale Group's identity." They add that such a 
partnership would lead to "abandonment of our national 
independence in the sensitive sector of military intelligence 
satellites." 
  In support of its position--and it threatens to call a 
strike 
eventually, "if the views of organized labor groups are not 
taken into account"--the Cannes inter-union published what it 
said would be the "financial structure" of the joint satellite 
subsidiary. Emphasizing that Aerospatiale would control "less 
than 50 percent" of the company while DASA would control "more 
than 50 percent." It also claimed Aerospatiale and DASA have 
parallel plans for cooperation on missiles, in the framework of 
another schema that is identical but for the fact that in this 
case the French group would have a controlling share. 
  Sources at Aerospatiale headquarters say the satellite 
partnership "is still only in the early stages of discussion; 
formal negotiations have not even begun." According to the 
spokesman for the French group, "no apportionment (of shares in 
the partnership) has yet been proposed, because the scope of 
activities is still being evaluated" with respect to the 
satellite partnership. On the other hand, Aerospatiale 
management acknowledges that the missile partnership is "further 
advanced" and even "approaching closure." Not that any 
announcement is expected in the very near future! 
  Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's CEO, said in early January 
there were "two sets of discussions under way with DASA, one on 
space and another on missiles," with the objective of 
establishing "a balanced structure in which neither side would 
swallow the other"---a structure which he said might be based 
"on the Eurocopter model." As for when it might all come to 
pass, he "hoped" (but that is all) for 1994! 
  But Gallois's problem is how to create a "balanced" dual 
partnership with Deutsche Aerospace when Aerospatiale is in a 
much better industrial position than its German partner, 
especially in satellites. So one can begin to appreciate the 
anxiety felt at Cannes by the unions--and workers--knowing the 
facility currently has a "full order-book." And should continue 
to have one, even after delivering the four Eutelsat and Turksat 
satellites that Ariane is supposed to launch in 1994. 
  Broadly speaking, Aerospatiale's Space and Defense division 
is in relatively good shape. Michel Delaye, head of the 
division, told us recently that with manpower cut back to 4,725 
(from 5,600), the division last year produced Fr8 billion in 
sales and Fr9 billion in orders, with satellites alone 
responsible for Fr3.2 billion of orders and Fr2.4 billion of 
sales, almost double the volumes for 1992!

<F P=106> [Article by F. J. and N. B.: "Why Brussels Has Given </F>
Messier-Dowty Merger the Green Light"] 
  [Text] By authorizing the merger between 
Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, the European Union is 
endowing Europe with a structure capable of rivaling the 
American enterprises. 
  In giving the green light to the creation of Messier-Dowty 
International Ltd in the landing-gear sector, Karel Van Miert, 
the European commissioner for competition, has created a 
precedent in the aeronautical sector. Actually, he has 
recognized that the market in which the project calling for the 
creation of a jointly-owned Messier-Dowty company by the Snecma 
and TI groups on a 50/50 basis, to merge their landing-gear 
activities, must be positioned, is unquestionably the world 
market, rather than that of the European Community. His 
predecessor, Sir Leon, in the Havilland-Aerospatiale-Alenia 
affair, judged the need differently. And as a result, he 
rejected the acquisition of the first of these by the latter two. 
  To date, the Europeans have been lost out in the bidding on 
contracts simply because the European manufacturers of landing 
gear (Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace) were too small to 
rival the big U.S.-based firms CPC (recently acquired by BF 
Goodrich) and Menasco. In 1990, Menasco obtained the contract 
for the Fokker F100/130, and TI's Dowty Aerospace division was 
eliminated, although traditionally it had been Fokker's 
preferred supplier of landing gear. More recently, Menasco 
magnanimously offered Messier-Bugatti a partnership in a Boeing 
777 contract. 
  Currently, Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, Europe's two 
number ones, have very few other competitors. Specifically, they 
are Great Britain's AP Precision Hydraulic, with its 5 percent 
of the world market, Italy's Magnaghi, Israel's Servo Hydraulic 
Lod, Japan's Sumitomo, etc; all these small manufacturers 
together representing a total of 17 percent. The U.S.-based CPC 
and Menasco companies account for 38 percent and 22 percent of 
the world market respectively. Thus, it is impossible for the 
Europeans separately to compete with them on the same footing. 
With the forming of Messier-Dowty, the Europeans will be able 
to, since the joint company will be in a position to obtain 23 
percent of the world market, whereas neither of the two 
companies separately attains a 15-percent share of it at present. 
  In the course of their investigations, the sleuths of the 
Community's General Directorate for Competition (DG 4) were 
compelled to recognize that it would have been absurd to 
consider only the Community market, even though, a priori, the 
creation of Messier-Dowty entails a monopoly situation. Why? 
First, because of the characteristic of its clients. There are 
only four principal clients worldwide: Airbus, Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The three 
civil-sector builders, namely, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell 
Douglas, represent 80 percent of the market in terms of the 
value of all purchases of landing gear for civil aircraft. And 
the DOD alone has 70 percent, in terms of value, of all 
purchases for military applications. In any case, all four have 
a clear-cut preference for solidly-based suppliers who are not 
likely to suddenly disappear from the market. They want to be 
sure that once a supplier of is awarded a contract, he will be 
able to supply replacement parts throughout the life of the 
program. In addition, they very frequently require that the 
supplier of landing gear participate in the financial outlay for 
research and development. Suppliers must therefore attain a 
certain critical mass to be able to meet this challenge. In 
short, Airbus and Boeing do not seek necessarily the cheapest 
price, but rather a reliable long-term partner. 
  And secondly, according to the European experts, the 
creation 
of Messier-Dowty is not likely, per se, to eliminate the small 
manufacturers, even though Messier-Dowty, CPC, and Menasco will 
be in a position, among the three of them, to make a clean sweep 
of around 80 percent of the Western world's estimated $1 billion 
market for civil landing gear. The reason is very simple: The 
civil and military applications market is closely intertwined, 
and new competitors often enter the market via the military 
sector. This is the case in Germany and Japan. 
  The European Commission's green light will very likely 
enable 
Snecma and TI, to substantially reduce production costs. 
According to Karel Van Miert, they will also be able to develop 
the very recently constructed Dowty industrial site in Quebec, 
since 80 percent of Dowty Canada Limited's capital will go into 
Messier-Dowty, whose total capital will consist of this 80 
percent of Dowty Canada plus 90 percent of Dowty Aerospace's 
capital, and 90 percent of the capital of ERAM, 
Messier-Bugatti's subsidiary, to which all of Messier-Bugatti's 
landing-gear activities will have priorly been transferred. 
ERAM's name will then be changed to Messier-Dowty SA. Via 
Messier-Dowty, the two parent companies will thus attain a 
critical mass capable of competing with the American firms. 
  The other side of the coin is that TI and Snecma will have 
to 
restructure their landing-gear activities, possibly with job 
losses. But according to Messier-Bugatti's top management, this 
restructuring has already taken place over the past two years. 
If the current level of activity continues, there will be no 
need for new reductions in staff.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Vergnano: "Telecom Bets on the Network"] </F>
  [Text] Greater autonomy for the network. Taking advantage 
of new business without incurring the wrath of the European 
Union. This will be the salient line of Telecom Italia, the 
single telecommunications operator that is currently being set 
up, the macro structure of which is now in the finishing stages. 
It will be divided into five divisions: network; business; 
mobile radios (that will also deal with part of the satellite 
activity in the future); basic and international services. 
  How was this decision reached? One of the main goals that 
STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] set itself in 1992, when 
the law on the reorganization of the telecommunications sector 
was approved, was the establishment of Telecom Italia. Up to 
now telecommunications has been a fragmented realm of 
competencies and functions, that has obviously brought about 
waste and lost opportunities. It was a precise goal, but not an 
easy one. So STET created a special internal task force (that 
comes directly under Managing Director Michele Tedeschi), called 
in external consultants, and to avoid the usual rows with 
Brussels, intensified its monitoring of the European directive 
on deregulation that is becoming increasingly restrictive as 
demonstrated during the recent bidding for the GSM cellular 
telephone. For example, amongst the many directives from 
Brussels, there is number 44 of 1992 (which is being 
incorporated into the Italian regulations) that provides for 
"transparency" of the network based on the so-called ONP [Open 
Network Provision]. A special division with responsibility for 
the network has also been planned for Telecom Italia to avoid 
failure to comply with European Union directives. But let us 
proceed in an orderly way. 
  The reports of the four consulting companies called upon by 
STET (Bain Cuneo, McKinsey, Tesi and Telos) to compare the 
possibilities for realigning the Italian telephone with the 
leading industrialized countries and to make a detailed study of 
the structures of the other administrations, were delivered 
before Christmas. They were immediately distributed to the 
strategic task force, to the operational structures of STET and 
IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry], to the 
executive committees, and to the advisors of the companies 
involved in the operation. 
  The dossiers of the four consultants are set out in 
different 
ways and reach several conclusions. The McKinsey report is 
based more on international comparison, the others are more of 
an organizational nature. Let us start with the first. After 
having compared the principal operators in the sector at a world 
level, the McKinsey report reached the conclusion that today 
STET is more efficient than the very well-known (and privatized) 
British Telecom (BT), but a little less efficient than the 
French operator and the German Telekom. Furthermore, still 
according to McKinsey, SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone 
Company] should still have ample margins to improve the quality 
of its service, its purchasing policy, and its dealings with 
major international clients. As far as the tariff side is 
concerned, the Italians recognize the fact that a single 
operator is a good opportunity to restructure the tariffs too, 
since the existing restrictions can finally be lifted. 
  Now that the reports have been thoroughly studied, the men 
from STET seem to have come to a fairly precise idea about how 
to structure the Telecom Italia that is being created. But they 
know well that the process will not be a short one, because once 
the optimal structure has been outlined, its realization needs 
to be careful and gradual. 
  The first key point is the confirmation of Tecnitel, the 
subholding led by Umberto Silvestri, for the management of 
companies like Italtel, SIRTI [Italian Telephone Network 
Company], AET [Electrical Telephone Equipment], and NECSY 
[Network Control Systems] operating in the manufacturing and 
installation sector of the STET group. Furthermore, according 
to the prevailing hypothesis, the other companies that are not 
involved in the management of services (Finsiel [Information 
Systems Finance Company], Saritel, CSELT [Telecommunications 
Study Center and Laboratories], Telesoft, etc.) will be excluded 
from the reorganization. 
  And what about the sole operator (that has always been 
called 
Telecom Italia, even if the name could change)? Barring last 
minute modifications -- that are always possible -- the 
divisional structure chosen by SIP in the fall of 1991 should be 
substantially confirmed, at least as far as its philosophy is 
concerned. 
SIP currently comprises a dozen staff functions (the areas 
covering quality, programming, technology, network, strategic 
planning, real estate, purchasing, external relations, auditing, 
central affairs, administration, and personnel), and four 
divisions (basic services, business, public telephones and 
mobile radio telephones). Telecom Italia is moving toward a 
structure that has more divisions and a further balance of staff 
functions. The most important transition is the transformation 
of the basic network connecting districts, excluding the local 
network, into an autonomous division. The Telecom 
infrastructure will be created by merging the SIP, Iritel, 
Italcable, and Telespazio networks, while a single 
administration and control of the technical area (for plants and 
operations) have become essential prerequisites as far as 
marketing is concerned. In particular the network division will 
become the sole supplier both for "internal customers" and for 
the external ones (for example the operator of the private GSM 
or the major companies), as provided for by European Union 
directives. Then a new division will be formed for international 
communications, while public telephones will become part of the 
basic services that will lose the major part of the network. 
  So Telecom Italia will have five divisions. And a couple of 
warnings: First, within a period that still has to be defined, 
mobile radios should break off to become an autonomous business, 
while the policy of alliances could produce new structures. If 
this is the new Italian telecommunications structure that is 
emerging, the levels of autonomy of the various structures, the 
details of the staff areas, and the relative weights to be given 
to the various boxes shown on the organization chart [not shown] 
must still be defined.

<F P=106> [Article by Giacomo Ferrari: "Ivrea's Third War"] </F>
  [Text] On the top floor of the building in Via Jervis in 
Ivrea, the historic headquarters of Olivetti, the top managers 
have already called it a "genetic mutation" to stress its 
revolutionary aspect and identify the new industrial period. It 
is destined to characterize the company of the year 2000. 
  It is not the first time that this image has been used to 
define what Olivetti has been doing. It was first used when 
Olivetti moved from mechanics (typewriters and traditional 
calculators, older people will remember the mythical Divisumma) 
to electronics. It was used for the second time when Carlo De 
Benedetti was making his greatest stand and the company made its 
dynamic entry into computer science. And the third? "It has 
just started," they explain at Ivrea. So much so that it has 
not taken on a definitive form yet. But the road is open. And 
it is the road of multimedia, that is the road to an ever closer 
integration of computer science and telecommunications. 
  It is easy to talk. In reality it is a sort of 180-degree 
turn, that involves the same company culture, but that is quite 
difficult to explain. The Olivetti management has tried to do 
so on various occasions. For example when they decided to 
participate in the race to become the second administrator of 
the Italian cellular telephone network, and more recently when 
they launched the "Domus Life" line onto the Italian market. 
This is a personal computer that can receive television 
transmissions, read audio and video CD-ROM disks, and connect up 
with other users to exchange video games. It can even reproduce 
the background music for "karaoke," the musical entertainment of 
the moment. Ivrea is concentrating a lot of effort on this 
product. According to the French newspaper LE FIGARO, there 
will be a market for about 1.3 million of these machines in 
Europe in 1996 when families throughout Europe will own a total 
of 19 million personal computers. Olivetti hopes to sell 
200,000 over the next two years. 
  But this turn in the direction of the new business is not 
excluding others. In fact Olivetti will continue to build and 
sell its traditional products, although this will be done within 
a different organizational framework. The sectors have been 
merged and subdivided in a new way to facilitate the application 
of the new strategies. The Olivetti group is divided into four 
large areas: products (personal computers, printers, office 
equipment, and accessories); systems (complete information 
packages, for example the networks used by banks and the post 
office administration); services (maintenance, engineering and 
customer assistance also for products produced by competitors); 
finally, telecommunications and multimedia systems, with the 
Omnitel consortium for cellular telephones which is 51-percent 
controlled by Olivetti and which also includes the companies 
Bell Atlantic, Swedish Telecom, and Shearson Lehman for the 
financial part. 
  Many things are brewing, and the company is not keeping 
these 
projects tucked away in a drawer. On the contrary the draft 
agreement signed with the unions on Monday, 17 January, on cuts 
in production, discussed them at length. At least 20 of the 38 
pages making up the document, which was signed by the minister 
of labor, are dedicated to prospects and industrial strategies. 
  Olivetti intends making a new start based on its refound 
"social peace". This peace has come at the end of a long period 
of cuts in the work force; the group had 60,000 employees 
throughout the world in 1989 and less than 37,000 remain today. 
But the streamlining, together with all the other interventions 
(financial, industrial and organizational), has been 
insufficient to put the accounts of the holding company back 
into the black. This is understandable in the light of the 
dramatic situation of a year ago. The losses registered on the 
balance sheet for the 1992 financial year totaled more than 650 
billion lire. The same company sources recognize that in 
effect, if it had not been for the reserves and the other 
extraordinary accounts that have been utilized, the losses would 
have totaled more than 800 billion lire. Furthermore, for the 
second consecutive year there has been a fall in revenues, with 
consolidated sales confined to eight trillion lire. 
These are serious difficulties that reflect the serious 
situation the computer science sector is still experiencing 
throughout the world. Carlo De Benedetti has returned to manage 
Olivetti himself and has recently called Corrado Passera to his 
side as managing director. Together they have planned out a 
therapy for recovery that has these three goals: 1) to start to 
grow again, 2) to reinforce the financial position, 3) to 
balance the accounts. This is all to be achieved in the 
relatively short period of not more than two years. 
  Half of this time has already passed and perhaps the 
schedule 
needs to be updated, particularly as far as the income statement 
is concerned. In fact the partial balance is only positive as 
far as the first two aspects are concerned. Revenues have 
started to rise again, and a few days ago the first unofficial 
figures showed that at the end of 1993 consolidated sales had 
reached 8.6 trillion, an increase of 7.5 percent. According to 
the men from Ivrea, market quotas have been regained in Europe, 
particularly in personal computers (also thanks to the 
enrichment of the range of products, passing from one to four 
lines) and, most important of all, the volume of sales has 
increased enough to compensate for the drop in prices. Then the 
devaluation of the lira has certainly helped as far as revenues 
expressed in foreign currency are concerned. 
  The second goal, the financial one, has also been achieved. 
Not that the situation was particularly difficult a year ago. 
The relationship between debts and assets could have been taken 
as balanced. But it was necessary to put "hay in the barn," 
also in consideration of the burden that was to come from future 
cuts in the work force. Therefore, overcoming the skepticism of 
many of his collaborators, De Benedetti launched an increase in 
capital of 900 billion lire. An operation that the stock 
exchange easily digested and that allowed Olivetti to reinforce 
itself on this front too. 
  The third goal remains, that of achieving a balance. Here 
the news is not so good. Without doubt there will be an 
improvement resulting from the initiatives that ended during the 
year, such as the dismissal of nonstrategic activities (from 
Teknecomp to the Triumph Adler buildings in Germany). However, 
the losses for 1993 will still be high. Analysts estimate that 
the losses will be between 400 and 500 billion lire. So it is 
unlikely that the forecasts made two years ago will be met. The 
1994 financial year is all that remains to find budgetary 
equilibrium again and objectively this is not long enough. 
  In any case, they have not lost hope in Ivrea, and they are 
working to get as close as possible to this result. What 
instruments are they using? At Olivetti they explain: "We must 
increase the supply and then we must arrive on the market more 
quickly. The average life of a product is six months today. 
Furthermore, all the efforts are aimed at widening the offer. 
This year we will produce 40 new personal computers and 50 are 
planned for next year." But multimedia is the real challenge. 
"The marriage between computer science and telecommunications 
is the real business of the future. This is what the life of a 
group like ours depends on." This is the third revolution. 
Will De Benedetti and his team be able to happily lead the way 
to this haven?

<F P=106> [Article by Rodolfo Bosio: "Fiat: 10 New Models Are Ready"] </F>
  [Text] Since 15 January, when talks with labor unions 
broke off and the decision was taken to lay off first 1,800 
white-collar and then 4,500 blue-collar workers full time, Fiat 
Auto has been caught up in strikes and protest demonstrations 
and has been the focus of disputes and controversies, with 
interventions by government officials and even bishops. All 
this was perhaps inevitable. 
  As a result of this situation Fiat Auto Managing Director 
Paolo Cantarella decided to run through the contents of his 
strategic plan again, explaining its reasons and goals. He 
began by analyzing the trend in demand (after the collapse in 
1993 a recovery is forecast starting this year and a subsequent 
gradual improvement), as well as the moves by European and 
American competitors. All companies are resorting to 
investments and restructuring, but Fiat Auto is investing more 
than anyone, and with complete confidence. From 1992 to date it 
has already invested 20 trillion lire and the same amount is 
planned for the future. 
<H5>  Strategy </H5>
  The large investments and restructuring in progress are two 
aspects of the same strategic plan, aimed at the development of 
Fiat Auto, even in the long term. It is based on four areas of 
action: Product and range, costs, sales network and service, and 
the break- even point. These are the factors which Fiat 
considers essential for ensuring global competitiveness, 
profitability, and the conditions for ongoing improvement. 
  Some fundamental policy milestones have already been 
achieved, symbolically represented by the Punto model and the 
Melfi plant, although others remain unfulfilled. This explains 
the conflicts within Fiat Auto, whose results are still 
disappointing (a drop in sales and market share, full-time 
lay-offs, and continuing losses) yet more new models are being 
introduced and the company appears fully convinced of its future 
success. 
<H5>  Product and Range </H5>
  Paolo Cantarella's plan foresees valorization of the group's 
brands, coverage of market niches, and definition of life cycles 
in line with the top international competitors (the lifespan of 
Fiat Auto models, already down to 8.4 years, the European 
average, is destined to fall to six years, like the Japanese). 
The group's 14 basic models listed in 1993 are to rise to 19 in 
1996: Fiat brands will increase from six to nine, and both 
Lancia and Alfa from four to five. 
  According to the plans, 1994 will see the introduction of 10 
new models. Fiat is to launch the coupe, the Punto cabriolet, 
and the hatchback, as yet nameless (code name U60), as well as 
the new Ducato. Lancia is to introduce the Dedra station wagon, 
its first of this type, and at the end of the year, the 
follow-up to the Thema. Finally Alfa is to present a sports 
model and a coupe, plus two different models for the segment 
that currently only has the 33. All these new cars, presented at 
the Mirafiori plant, give the impression of reliability, thanks 
also to their well-defined features. 
  The total renewal and extension of the range are combined 
with corresponding efforts aimed at mechanical components. For 
example, the Mirafiori plant has begun to produce transmissions 
for segment B and C models (4,300 a day at full capacity, an 
investment of 810 billion lire); while in the spring the Pratola 
Serra plant (formerly Arna) is to produce the first 
five-cylinder engines and later, again at the Mira plant, the 
revolutionary "Torque" (base of 1,600 cc, 16 valves, 1,100 
produced per day, an investment of 380 billion lire). 
<H5>  Plants </H5>
  The plan approved at the end of 1993 calls for 
reorganization 
to obtain maximum competitiveness levels from each final plant 
(with an average daily production of 1,400 vehicles), quality 
(assigning specific missions), and flexibility. The models for 
the Mirafiori plant are Panda, Punto, Type D sedan and station 
wagon, and Uno (completely knocked down); for Rivalta both the 
Dedra versions; for Cassino the Tipo, Tempra, and two Tipo C's; 
for Melfi Punto and Y11; for Termini Punto; for Pomigliano the 
two new Alfa automobiles, the Delta, and 155 model; finally for 
Arese the sports model and the Alfa coupe. 
The Arese plant, still the "driving force" behind the Alfa 
brand, has been assigned the mission of manufacturing special 
vehicles; Mirafiori becomes strategic for the D segment (23 
percent of the European market), Rivalta for the E (10 percent), 
Cassino for the C (31 percent), and Termini Imerese for the B 
(27 percent). Pomigliano (C and D) already produces 1,200 
vehicles a day, double the capacity of the former Alfa Sud, and 
a rate destined to rise further. 
<H5>  Costs </H5>
  Reorganization of the industrial structure, according to 
Cantarella, is fundamental for cost optimization, together with 
the introduction of the integrated factory and rationalization 
of the system of suppliers, drastically reduced in number but 
now working even closer with the firm and even in partnership 
with it. 
  This area also involves efforts at lowering the break-even 
point (the goal is 1.2 million vehicles, the number sold by Fiat 
Auto in Europe in 1993), via a reduction in fixed costs 
throughout the company, at the same time ensuring by making the 
necessary sacrifices, maintained flexibility so as to exploit 
opportunities. 
<H5>  Network and Service </H5>
  In order to extend and improve the sales network over 230 
billion lire were invested last year which will rise to around 
300 billion lire this year. This is confirmation of the 
interest shown in this area, which is as strategic as 
after-sales service. Various measures are planned or already 
implemented, including dualizing of a number of sales outlets 
and service centers to enable dealers to enhance 
competitiveness, above all when the market trend is unfavorable. 
Cantarella aims at 1,060 European Alfa Romeo outlets (974 today 
and 840 in 1987) and 1,224 for Lancia (1,127) for 1996. 
<H5>  Overseas </H5>
  An important item in the investment program is Fiat Auto's 
operations abroad, in particular Turkey, Poland, and Brazil. 
These three markets are recording constant growth in sales and 
the Fiat market share. Last year Tofas (a Fiat joint venture) 
gained 47.2 percent of the Turkish market (410,000 
registrations), Fiat Poland 54 percent of the domestic market 
(241,000), and FIASA (100 percent Fiat) 22.8 percent of the 
market in Brazil (972,000). 
  Fiat Auto has allocated approximately 3 trillion lire to 
development projects in these areas, convinced of the 
opportunities they will offer, also as outlets for products 
manufactured in Italian plants (one example being the completely 
knocked down Uno). In 1993 Fiat Auto exported 76,624 vehicles 
there, compared to the 18,354 of 1991, and should exceed the 
185,000 mark in 1996 (18,000 to Brazil, 34,000 to Poland, and 
133,000 to Turkey).

  [Text] Siemens AG intends to invest more than 2 billion 
German marks in the new Dresden semiconductor factory over the 
next 10 years. COMPUTER ZEITUNG spoke to Heinrich von Pierer, 
board chairman of Siemens AG, about the electronics giant's 
project and the problems and prospects facing the chip industry. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] The head of the Munich-based Fraunhofer 
Institute of Solid-State Technology, Ingolf Ruge, takes a 
skeptical viewe regarding Siemens' plans to build a 
semiconductor factory in Dresden, claiming that the project is 
risky in that the infrastructure is better in Asia. So why has 
Siemens decided in favor of Germany? 
  [von Pierer] Many aspects of Mr. Ruge's appraisal are 
correct. Any major investment of this type is risky, but a 
businessman has to live with risks. However, it must be 
realized that Mr. Ruge is referring to the fact that the 
machinery and chemicals have to be procured from abroad, but the 
situation would have been no different had we invested in 
Singapore, Malaysia, or Taiwan, as most of the equipment comes 
from Japan. I believe that what we are now doing here will also 
be a signal for the supply industry, and that it will give rise 
to new developments in this area. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] Siemens used to complain that the 
politicians were always calling for production to be kept in 
Germany... 
  [von Pierer] Siemens did not complain. We have always 
endeavored to stress the positive factors in the debate on 
locational conditions. Germany must not be written off as a 
manufacturing base. Of course, there are a number of worrying 
factors, but we have a superb infrastructure and great political 
stability in Germany, added to which good labor relations play a 
major role. There are also highly qualified skilled workers and 
engineers in Dresden. Germany will hold its own as a 
manufacturing base in the future as well. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] So there was no arm-twisting behind the 
decision? 
  [von Pierer] No, no one can force us into this. It was a 
decision taken on mature reflection. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] You recently said in an interview that 
Siemens intends to lay more staff off and relocate more of its 
production abroad. How can this be reconciled with your 
involvement in Dresden? 
  [von Pierer] I did not say that we would relocate production 
abroad. What I said was that under current conditions we are 
forced to create and expand production and engineering capacity 
abroad and that there are two reasons for this: The first is to 
take advantage of the lower costs that can be achieved abroad, 
and the second is to open up markets. In many projects it is 
extremely important to be able to do business locally as well. 
This applies especially in Southeast Asia, where we have done a 
lot of business. And we shall continue to do so in Siemens' 
various sectors of operation. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] The semiconductor industry is booming at 
the moment. What is your forecast for this sector over the next 
few years? 
  [von Pierer] For memory chips there will be the usual cycles 
that can break off at any time. However, I see quite clearly 
that there will be a further growth in demand for logical units. 
We have conducted surveys of our own that predict 10- to 
13-percent annual growth in this market. Our system know-how 
gives us the skills needed to secure an appropriate share of 
this market. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] So you mainly expect growth in logical 
units? 
  [von Pierer] I see it for memory chips as well. The only 
thing is that our past experience with memory chips has taught 
us that these cycles end. I cannot say when such a bullish 
cycle of the type we are going through now will collapse. One 
has to assume that it will happen some time. This will be less 
the case in the logical field. 
  [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] Will Siemens subsidiary SNI [Siemens- 
Nixdorf] be in the market for semiconductors from the new 
factory? 
  [von Pierer] SNI will be a major customer, for instance for 
personal computers, in which we have achieved over 100-percent 
growth over the last two years. Our eco-PC's will also 
constitute a user market for Dresden's chip output.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Aerospatiale Strengthens </F>
Its Position"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Operating below capacity and with declining sales, 
the group strengthens its strategic alliances. 
  For Aerospatiale, 1993 was a very bad year. The traditional 
annual results presentation by its chief executive officer 
[CEO], Louis Gallois, perfectly illustrated these difficult 
conditions. Sales shrank by 5 percent, to 49.3 billion francs 
[Fr], and new orders dropped by 25.6 percent, from Fr39 billion 
in 1992 to Fr29 billion last year, with a Fr130-billion backlog 
of orders (2.5 years of operation). "The helicopter and aircraft 
market was awful; all three manufacturers just broke even, with 
practically as many cancellations as new orders," the CEO 
commented. In spite of all, Louis Gallois wants his group to 
remain on the offensive, and he is starting work along four 
lines: to strengthen the group's alliance in its branch; to 
reconfigure the group with a view to its privatization; to 
prepare for the future by overhauling its product line; and to 
negotiate with the labor force. Being an optimist, he predicts 
that 1994 will be "a year for conquest and ambition." 
  Thus, Aerospatiale pursued its strategy of national and 
international alliances. In France, it signed an agreement with 
SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] concerning the 
CELERG company, a specialist of tactical missile motors (see 
next page). With DASA [German Aerospace Company], its partner of 
30 years, Aerospatiale is planning new partnerships based on the 
Eurocopter model; these partnerships will materialize in the 
next few months in the fields of missiles, space, and commuter 
aircraft. For the latter, Louis Gallois believes that "because 
of its dynamism, the ATR [commuter aircraft] economic interest 
group should serve as a pole for turboprop aircraft production, 
and that the new ATR-82 project might be used as a basic 
program." Preliminary talks, therefore, started in all 
directions, both in Europe (with Fokker, Dornier, Saab, and 
British Aerospace) and in many Asian countries. 
  Concerning satellites, which represent sales of Fr1.5 
billion 
and orders of Fr3.2 billion for Aerospatiale, Louis Gallois 
believes that the four-partner Alliance formed with Alcatel, 
DASA, and Alenia and which holds 49 percent of Space System 
Loral, is "somewhat weak." This in spite of the fact that it was 
through the Alliance that Aerospatiale's Cannes plant (which 
just delivered the photography unit of the Helios military 
observation satellite to MATRA [Mechanics, Aviation, and 
Traction company]) obtained the contract for the Intelsat-7 
satellite integration. He wishes, therefore, to strengthen the 
Alliance as soon as possible, and Eurocopter might be used as a 
model. "Our ambition is to place each of our operations in the 
partnership structure most likely to promote its development," 
Louis Gallois indicated. 
  In France, this ambition already resulted in the creation of 
an Aerospatiale maintenance group. This restructuring is part of 
the efforts the group must make with a view to its 
privatization. These efforts also involve financial 
reorganization, which started in 1992. The resulting improvement 
affected the net result which, although still a loss, showed a 
"marked improvement" thanks to the austerity measures adopted by 
the personnel as a whole. It also affected the debt, which was 
stabilized and even decreased by Fr1.5 billion. Finally, the 
capital should be increased to Fr3 billion. The objective is now 
to restore equilibrium as soon as possible, by 1995 at the 
latest.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "New Step Toward Establishment </F>
of Messier-Dowty"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] By merging their landing gear operations, 
Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace are aiming at the pole 
position in the worldwide market. 
  Finally, on 2 December, France's Snecma and Great Britain's 
TI Group signed the agreement to merge the landing gear 
operations of their respective subsidiaries, Messier-Bugatti and 
Dowty Aerospace. Fulfilling the hope expressed by Jean-Paul 
Bechat, Messier-Bugatti's president-chief executive officer, 
during an interview with AIR &amp; COSMOS last July (see AIR 
&amp; 
COSMOS No. 1433, page 11) in connection with the announcement 
that negotiations between the two companies had begun, steps to 
evaluate and set up the company were completed before the end of 
the year. The fact remains that actual establishment of the 
Messier-Dowty firm still requires approval by stockholders in 
both firms and by national and Community authorities. That 
approval is expected in the early months of 1994. 
  By combining the landing gear operations of the two firms, 
Messier-Dowty should achieve an annual turnover of about 2.5 
billion francs with some 2,400 employees divided between Great 
Britain, France (the Bidos plant in Pyrenees-Atlantiques), and 
Canada, where Dowty is firmly established. 
  When the agreement was being signed, Gerard Renon, president 
of Snecma, and Sir Christopher Lewinton, president of the TI 
Group, said only that Messier-Dowty would be among the world's 
leading landing gear manufacturers. It is felt, however, that 
the newly formed firm may take first place--ahead of the 
Cleveland Pneumatic Corp., which recently joined the B.F. 
Goodrich Group, and Menasco of the Coltec Industry Group.

<F P=106> [Article by J.G.; "Christian Blanc: We Must Catch up With or </F>
Outdo Lufthansa by 1997"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] As far as the president of Air France is 
concerned, this is the only real challenge that the airline must 
absolutely meet if it does not want to be swept away. 
  Air France President Christian Blanc and his team met with 
representatives of the company's union organizations early this 
week to discuss the contents of a memo he had sent them the week 
before. 
  Considered a "focusing document" and having the value of a 
"framework," the 13-page document was intentionally left 
incomplete so that it could easily be altered, if necessary, or 
rounded out as a result of the talks held during the meetings. 
Comprising four chapters--"Where Are We?" "How Did We Get 
There?" "What Must the Spirit of Reform Be?" and "Air France's 
Battles"--the document reviews the situation (estimated losses 
of 7.5 billion francs in 1993 and indebtedness totaling some 36 
billion francs) and sets forth the objectives to be achieved to 
enable Air France to catch up with the leading airlines and 
ensure its survival. The model chosen is Lufthansa because the 
challenge in that case is a reasonable one. "The German airline 
began to overhaul itself only a year ago, whereas British 
Airways began stirring 10 years ago," and besides, any recovery 
that might bring Air France up to the same level as American or 
Asian airlines would result in the "social destruction" of the 
French company, something that Christian Blanc rejects. 
  The president of Air France notes in the memo distributed to 
union representatives that the company's announced losses for 
1993 account for half the total losses reported by the IATA's 
[International Air Transport Association's] 212 member airlines 
for that year. He identified the following as being among the 
factors contributing to those losses: 
  1. Insufficient earnings: the airline's current revenues do 
not cover its current expenditures. 
  2. A poor commercial position: the company's market declined 
by 7 percent in 1993, whereas the German and British markets 
grew during that same period by 7 percent and 9 percent 
respectively. 
  3. Air France's share of the international market declined 
by 
7 percent in 1993: 13 percent of all passengers chose the 
state-owned airline in 1989, but that figure is now down to 11 
percent. 
  4. Unprofitable routes: every 100 francs taken in is offset 
by 117 francs in expenditures in North Atlantic traffic, 111 
francs in South America, 110 francs in Europe, and 108 francs in 
Asia. Only West Africa pays off: with a profit of 6 francs! 
  5. The fleet is too heterogeneous: there are 24 different 
aircraft types (British Airways has 20) and 33 different cockpit 
versions. 
  6. Productivity is much too low: a British Airways agent 
produces 130 francs in revenues where an Air France agent 
produces 100, but what makes it worse is that the British agent 
costs 80 in wages and benefits, whereas the Air France agent 
costs 100. 
  7. Inappropriate working methods: where Air France spends 
100 
francs to carry passengers and/or freight, Lufthansa spends 94 
francs and British Airways spends 89 francs. 
  8. Organization and operating methods are too cumbersome, 
complex, hierarchical, and centralized--in other words, too 
costly. 
  9. The idea of customer service is insufficiently developed. 
  The objectives are set forth below. The meetings last Monday 
and Tuesday were to result in a new consensus document. That 
document will be submitted to all of the company's personnel, 
who will then have two months in which to give their input. The 
"plan for the company" that will emerge from this vast dialogue 
next spring will then be used as a common reference point for 
implementing the necessary actions. 
  The objective is to see to it that a significant portion of 
Air France's capital will belong to the personnel within three 
years if the necessary actions are successful. 
<H5>  Main Objectives </H5>
  1. To increase the company's economic efficiency by 30 
percent within three years. 
  2. To achieve a 14-percent increase in revenues within three 
years. 
  3. To achieve savings of 7 percent per year in all operating 
expenses for three years. This means buying less and better. 
  4. To reduce personnel costs by 10 percent annually for 
three 
years. 
  5. To reduce financial costs by half over the next five 
years. However, the state will not be able to inject more 
capital unless a return to a sound position becomes apparent. 
That is a necessary condition for getting the green light from 
Brussels. 
  The target year is 1997, the reason being that 1997 will 
mark 
the start of the single European air transport market, and it 
should also mark an end to the era of overcapacity in the 
airlines.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Bull Trying To Define Its </F>
Limits"] 
  [Text] After the Compagnie des Machines Bull refinanced to 
the tune of 8.5 billion FF in December and after it reduced its 
debt to 2.4 billion thanks to a squeeze in capital, the group's 
directors are now looking for ways to retain the advantage of a 
strengthened financial structure. Two goals have priority for 
1994: an increased business volume, and cost reduction. 
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull's CEO, is said to have begun by 
asking his dealers to produce 4 billion FF in 100 days! He has 
even supposedly found his war horse: ISM, the distributed 
systems environment for manufacturing management. 
  Trying to save 3 billion FF in 1994, the Bull CEO presumably 
will bring about a reorganization and a reduction in the number 
of locations, as well as measures favoring more part-time work 
and salary reductions. This program is becoming increasingly 
harder to negotiate with the unions, which walked out on the 
management team on 4 January on the grounds that some 
representatives had not been invited to the meeting. The agenda 
would have included a discussion of employee layoffs at the 
Villeneuve-d'Ascq plant, and the startup of Athesa, FM 
subsidiary of Bull. Nevertheless, it is now a given that Athesa 
TSP will take over the internal computer operations of Bull 
(about 750 MFF business volume), while the Athesa International 
holding company prepares the opening of a subsidiary in Great 
Britain in the near future. Athesa France, meanwhile, has just 
landed an initial contract for 20 MFF with the Caisse Centrale 
du Batiment for the Paris region.

  [Text] SSII, a subsidiary of CEA-Industries and Cap Gemini 
Sogeti, is supposed to finalize its reorganization by this 20 
January. According to a company spokesperson, Cisi is getting 
rid of a structure defined on the basis of tasks and is 
preparing to restructure its organization on the basis of its 
customers' market sectors. As a result, Cisi Ingenierie, Cisi 
Transtec and Cisi Telematique (excluding the part that is being 
reattached to Athesa France, Cisi's and Bull's joint subsidiary 
in facilities management) are going to merge into a single 
company. That will depend on Cisi SA, the financial holding 
company that is supposed to head up the group's overseas 
subsidiaries, as well as Athesa France. This restructuring is 
supposed to impart dynamism to Cisi activity (FF70 million in 
losses in 1992 on a turnover of FF1.5 billion) and accelerate 
structural savings. Shuffling the workforce at Rungis is also on 
the agenda.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Airbus Industrie </F>
Delivers 138 Aircraft in 1993"; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] Despite 69 canceled orders and a negative 
balance of 31 aircraft for the year, this GIE [economic interest 
group] increased its turnover by 13.7 percent to 50 billion 
francs and is still showing a profit. 
  Like its two American competitors, Airbus Industrie 
continued 
to feel the effects of the difficulties being experienced by the 
world's airlines throughout last year. It ended the year with 69 
canceled orders, compared to the cancellation of 95 units in 
1992, and 38 new orders, compared to 136 the year before. Those 
figures do not take into account the announced decisions by 
Cathay Pacific and Air Canada to purchase 12 of the model A340's. 
  The same decline was noted on the delivery side. General 
manager Jean Pierson announced at the start of 1993 that 150 
aircraft would be delivered at a price of $8.7 billion (50.5 
billion francs)--a 19 percent increase in value--but the 
consortium wound up delivering only 138 units (compared to 157 
in 1992) because of postponements by a number of airlines. But 
there was considerable progress nonetheless in terms of money 
values, since the deliveries included 22 A340's and one A330 
worth over $100 million each, and in the end, Airbus Industrie's 
turnover increased by 13.7 percent to $8.3 billion (48 billion 
francs). Operating results remained "favorable," although no 
details have been provided, the reason being that as usual, the 
GIE does not announce its "accounting surpluses," which exceeded 
1.5 billion francs ($267 million) in 1991 and 1992. 
  As a result of that succession of cancellations and the low 
volume of new orders, Airbus Industrie's order book has grown 
slim. The firm still had 952 aircraft (including 252 A330's and 
A340's) worth $71.2 billion to deliver as of the start of 1992, 
but that figure was down to 838 units worth $66.4 billion by the 
start of 1993 and 667 worth $55.4 billion by the start of this 
year. That is a drop of 30 percent in two years. But even so, 
the remaining orders represent over four years of production for 
the consortium's partners.

  The decline in new orders has already affected the rate at 
which Airbus aircraft are being produced. Jean Pierson stated 
last year that production would gradually increase from 150 to 
170 aircraft in 1995 (and that in itself was a retreat from the 
220 units announced in the boom days), but he has now revised 
production rates downward. "As early as the end of 1990, Airbus 
Industrie instituted a policy of rigorously managing its order 
book so as to judiciously adjust its future production rates in 
plenty of time to match the market," say officials in Toulouse. 
Result: the consortium has slowed the increase in its production 
rate, which now stands at 134 aircraft for 1994, 138 for 1995, 
and 154 for 1996, the mix including about 30 percent A330's and 
A340's and 50 percent A319's, A320's, and A321's. But Airbus 
Industrie also says that it "will continue to pay close 
attention to the market so as to be ready to adjust its work 
load whenever a change becomes necessary, but with the 
expectation that the market will recover during the second half 
of the decade." 
  And in fact, the consortium is beginning to view the future 
with "cautious optimism." The first signs of a stabilizing air 
transport market are appearing, and some airlines are again 
making a profit. And since it has an extensive and complete 
family of products, it feels that it "is capable of capturing 
more than 30 percent of the market."

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Business Down for Eurocopter"; </F>
AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction is 
"Despite a rally in orders and excellent market penetration, 
1994 will be another rough year."] 
  [Text] Just as CEO Jean-Francois Bigay predicted several 
months ago, the Franco-German group Eurocopter has posted losses 
of over 300 million French francs [Fr] for the 1993 fiscal year. 
Depreciation and specific contingency provisions account for 
Fr250 million of those Fr300 million. Eurocopter's turnover 
comes to Fr 10.21 billion, down 10.5 percent over 1992. 
  Executive board co-president Siegfried Sobotta attributes 
the 
sales slump to a decrease in receivables from production 
aircraft deliveries, which plummeted to 159 in 1993 from 211 in 
1992. No one expects those deliveries to start creeping upward 
again before mid-1995. Sobotta also sees the collapse as the 
result of a "sharply deteriorated non-military customer base", 
matched by a decline in service sales. "To adapt to this tough 
economic situation, we have had to implement measures that 
include staff cutbacks (a total of 1,060) in France and Germany, 
reduced working hours, and lower stock levels to bring operating 
costs under control," Siegfried Sobotta goes on to explain. 
  "1993 was a challenge way beyond anything we could have 
imagined," admits Jean-Francois Bigay. "Both the civil and 
military markets were disastrous--a level unlike anything we've 
seen since 1965-67." Despite all these woes, results are 
encouraging. "We took orders for Fr9.32 billion, including Fr4 
billion for maintenance and Fr3.5 for new aircraft. New airplane 
orders totaled 166 against 159 in 1992, despite a tough market." 
Moreover, the new orders involved higher tonnages: 43 
Cougar/Super Pumas against only 10 in 1992. 
  Market penetration results are also encouraging. Indeed, 
Eurocopter has increased its civil market share to 54 percent of 
the value of registered aircraft (compared to 51.5 percent in 
1992), and 60 percent of the value of registered craft in the 
parapublic sector. The group has also regained its pre-Gulf War 
military market share, or 24 percent of the value of aircraft, 
compared to 7.5 percent in 1992 (figures apply to the open 
military market, outside the CIS and USA). 
  Nearly all these market shares have been won through 
exports: 
95 percent of the new helicopters are registered outside France 
and Germany. This worries Jean-Francois Bigay, who notes that 
"Too high a rate of exports makes a company fragile; [...] we 
need national orders." 
  In any event, "1994 will be another rough year for the 
group," Jean-Francois Bigay continues. "Although orders are up, 
the effect will not be felt until 1995, and we expect another 
10-percent decline in turnover." 
  "1994 will be quite a challenge for us," continues Bigay. 
"Eurocopter will be consolidating to insure a calmer and more 
active future for itself... We will need support from every 
quarter to shore up our export position in 1994, while winning 
more national orders." Eurocopter's objective is to cover 100 
percent of the civil market's needs, and 80 percent of the 
military market's needs by century's end. 
  No layoffs are planned for 1994. This is another challenge 
the helicopter manufacturer has set for itself, one that depends 
on its hopes to capture national orders within the next six 
months. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: NH-90 Opts for the RTM322 </H5>
  Technical progress on the Tiger has been smooth, and the 
NH-90 transport helicopter program has taken a significant step 
forward with the final selection of several technical options. 
  --Engineers have chosen the RTM322 turbine of Rolls-Royce, 
Turbomeca, MTU, and Piaggio. It will be developed and rated for 
use in the naval and land versions of the NH90, while General 
Electric's and Fiat Avio's T700 will be partially rated 
("brought to technical maturity") as a second engine, ostensibly 
to equip Italy's 260 craft. 
  --Program planners no longer consider the rear ramp for the 
French Army's tactical transport version an optional feature. 
Instead they are taking it into account as they develop the 
helicopter. 
  --The naval version's carrying capacity will be expanded to 
include 700-kg missiles. 
  The other programs--the civil EC-120 and EC-135 and the 
military Tiger, which is beginning tests of its navigational and 
weapons systems--are moving ahead as planned. But the situation 
in Russia is at a virtual standstill. The proposed joint venture 
to develop the Mi-38 with Mil "has made little progress 
organizationally", according to Sigfried Sobotta.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Sextant Avionique Eyes the Trainer </F>
Aircraft Niche"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Sextant Avionique's display and navigation products 
are best positioned for the trainer niche, which promises to 
develop further as former East bloc countries "westernize" their 
aircraft. 
  As new aircraft programs become thin on the ground, Sextant 
Avionique is making the logical shift into military and civil 
modernization markets. So far, the French equipment maker has 
been fairly successful in the civil realm, notably with its new 
Enhanced Vision Systems piloting display technology. EVS aims to 
improve the poor-visibility landing capability of old aircraft, 
not all of whose autopilots perform up to requirements. 
  But Sextant's attempts to capture a share of the military 
market have stalled, for lack of both a clear strategy and 
opportunity. The equipment maker's product line, for instance, 
does not feature mission electronic systems (radar, 
navigation/attack systems), which are a key element in 
modernizing interception or ground-attack aircraft, the stars of 
the military aircraft retrofitting market. 
  Sextant's international marketing head Jose Sarnito divides 
the military retrofitting market into five categories: basic 
trainer aircraft; advanced trainer aircraft; air-to-ground 
attack aircraft; multipurpose aircraft; and, at the top of the 
echelon, multipurpose aircraft with night-flight capability. 
There is a wide array of equipment to be updated in each of 
these categories. 
  Customers will want new navigation and display instruments, 
usually culled from general aviation equipment catalogs, for 
basic trainer planes. In addition, advanced trainers will have 
to be equipped with a headup display, multipurpose screens, and 
an accurate navigational system, that is, with specifically 
military products. The third category, ground attack planes, 
introduces the need for such mission equipment as a laser 
telemeter, possibly a laser designation pod, and in some cases 
even a helmet sight to reduce the pilot's defense reaction time. 
Finally, the fourth category, multipurpose aircraft, requires 
radar, while the fifth calls for infrared devices for night 
attack capability. 
  Jose Sarnito considers advanced trainer planes (AlphaJet, 
Hawks, etc.) to be the most promising market segment. Sextant 
has a broad line of display and navigation products for advanced 
trainers, and can integrate their equipment. Lower down the 
product line, customers look for the best price on initiation 
aircraft, and take care of integrating equipment themselves. 
Higher up the line are operational aircraft, where the cost and 
technical weight of mission electronics become the overwhelming 
factor. Sextant does not aspire to market leadership in this 
niche, leaving it to its partner Thomson-CSF. Moreover, its big 
French competitor Sagem already has a firm foothold in the 
mission electronics market. 
  Jose Sarnito believes Sextant has a card to play in former 
East-bloc countries. "The governments of those countries," he 
explains, "are trying to preserve their cold-war-era industrial 
capability and pilot operational ability at the lowest possible 
cost." Their approach, whether in Poland, Czechoslovakia, or 
Russia, is to support new trainer projects that adapt Western 
avionics to locally-made airframes, which they will eventually 
convert into light fighter craft. Inspired by British 
Aerospace's success with the Hawk line, Poland's PZL took this 
approach with its M-93s and M-95s, which are versions of the 
Iryda I-22 with new engines and equipment. So did Mikoyan with 
its MiG-AT and Czechoslovakia's Aerovodochody with its L-159, a 
version extrapolated from the L-59 and said to have an added 
radar. 
<H5>  Joint Venture Project </H5>
  Sextant has decided to enter the market for the long term. 
"Our goal," explains Jose Sarnito, "is to imitate Allied Signal 
or the other big American equipment manufacturers. We want to 
develop ties with local distributors, set up shop in country, 
and team up with local industries to transfer technology or 
market manufacturing licenses." Sextant Avionique is said to be 
discussing a possible three-way joint venture with Polish and 
Czech equipment makers to pursue those goals. 
  Sextant's technical line involves a complete flight 
electronics system christened Topflight, from which customers 
can select a list of equipment based on specific project needs. 
Topflight features the one-piece headup display "Smart", 
liquid-crystal head-in-the-middle color displays, a set of 
computers that incorporates mission control and symbol 
generation functions, an anemobarometric device, and 
conventional emergency instrumentation. Depending on the 
navigational accuracy desired, customers can choose between the 
Stratus inertial measurement unit (with a Pixyz, three-axis, 
self-contained gyrolaser) developed for the Tiger helicopter, or 
the Totem gyrolaser navigational system that is currently being 
manufactured in large numbers to renovate the Transall. Finally, 
Sextant is also offering the Topstar military GPS receiver, with 
or without decoding, that it is delivering on Mirage 2000 Ds. 
  "To capture modernization markets," explains Jose Sarnito 
once again, "a company must always be able to offer 
off-the-shelf solutions. The sums involved do not cover the cost 
of new developments. And the first requirement of customers is 
always an accurate navigational system." 
  Sextant's liquid-crystal multipurpose displays have just 
been 
chosen by the Bangalore Aeronautics Establishment (India) to 
equip prototypes of the future light combat aircraft (LCA). 
Though the French equipment maker has its sights set on the more 
lucrative avionics integration or chief-contractor projects 
getting off the ground in east Europe, this is still an 
encouraging sign. In the meantime, however, its competitor Sagem 
has again managed to land most squarely on its feet: it has been 
selected by the Warsaw Aeronautics Institute to build the M-93 
demonstrator.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick Piernaz: "Europe Turns Toward Japan"] </F>
  [Text] Though for many years its development was based 
solely on American technology, Japan is now opening up to 
cooperation with European firms. Several proposals could lead to 
joint endeavors, mainly in civil aeronautics but also in the 
military domain... 
  In the civilian sector, three new joint Europe-Japan 
projects 
(with or without American participation) are under 
consideration. By order of size and feasibility in time, they 
are: 


    -  the YSX regional transport aircraft, with a capacity of 
70-80 passengers; 
  -  the future very large capacity aircraft (600-800 seats); 
  -  the second-generation SST (successor to the Concorde). 

    The YSX project is dear to the hearts of the Japanese. 
Prefeasibility studies for this aircraft, which would take the 
place of the YS11, are being carried out by Japan Aircraft 
Development (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki) with 
support from MITI [Ministry of Industry and Trade]. The Japanese 
have already held discussions with the Chinese on joint 
construction of the aircraft. In September 1993, a delegation 
from the Japanese Aeronautical Industries Group (SJAC) visited 
China at the invitation of its counterpart, the China National 
Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC). The two entities agreed to 
promote exchanges between the two countries, and in particular 
to launch discussions on development of this 70-80 seat plane. 
The two Asian partners are also looking for one or two western 
partners. Possible candidates include Boeing, the Franco-Italian 
ATR, and Sweden's Saab. 
  Boeing's participation would come as a surprise, since the 
American airplane builder dropped out of the regional aircraft 
market a little more than 2 years ago by selling off its 
Canadian subsidiary De Havilland. But Boeing has made Japan 
virtually a private preserve. The Japanese builders are closely 
involved in Boeing manufactures, particularly in production of 
the 767 and the future Boeing 777; the Japanese are junior 
partners in production of the latter, supplying a large part of 
the fuselage. Plus there is the forthcoming 737-X, which the 
Japanese selected after toying with the idea of developing their 
own 150-seat aircraft. If Boeing is ready to "get aboard" the 
YSX, it is probably just to keep an eye on what Japanese 
builders are planning with other firms. All the same, the 
Americans are taking it very seriously. Dean Thorton, president 
of Boeing Commercial Airline Group (BCAG), traveled to Japan in 
October 1993. He reaffirmed his company's interest in the YSX 
project and according to our information actually entered into 
negotiations with Japan about the program. Since January, the 
negotiations begun by Thorton have been pursued by Ronald 
Woodard, his successor as head of BCAG. 
  Finally, it was learned a few days ago in the Japanese press 
that European builders ATR and Saab might participate in the 
program. These two partners would lend technical credibility and 
an extraordinary marketing base to this program, leaving 
Germany's DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] and its Fokker subsidiary 
out in the cold. Sources at Aerospatiale and ATR confirm the 
discussions now under way, noting that other partnerships are 
also under consideration and the question has not yet been 
decided. 
  The two other civilian programs that might give rise to 
joint 
ventures with Japan are less far advanced. The giant 600-800 
seat aircraft is the subject of discussions between European and 
American firms, which are going to meet in March to decide 
whether to pursue feasibility studies. If the project gets a 
go-ahead, it is clear the Japanese manufacturers will be 
participating. For two reasons: The first is that they are ready 
to contribute substantially to the financing--and lots of money 
will be needed. According to latest available figures, it would 
cost 90 to 120 billion French francs [Fr] to develop a 
super-jumbo aircraft! 
  The second argument for Japanese participation is the fact 
that Japanese airlines comprise most of the estimated 500-plane 
market for jumbo carriers. It is difficult to imagine Japan 
Airlines or ANA opting for such an aircraft if their country 
were excluded from its manufacture. It is always possible, 
however, that European and American builders will decide not to 
work together. In that event, they would be fighting to cut a 
deal with their Japanese partner. About a year ago, Airbus 
Industrie made some overtures along those lines to Japan. Boeing 
did not appreciate it. 
  There remains a third domain of possible cooperation between 
western firms and the Japanese: the second-generation supersonic 
transport. The Japanese are very excited about the Concorde's 
successor, especially the technological potential of such a 
program. Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, and Fuji have joined the 
American-European study group working on the feasibility study. 
This SST would carry 250-300 passengers and have a range of 
10,000 to 12,000 km traveling at twice the speed of sound. It 
would thus go twice as far as the Concorde and carry twice as 
many passengers. But no one knows whether the fare would be half 
as expensive. According to Boeing, for success to be assured, 
the average fare (all seating classes combined) for a supersonic 
flight could not be more than 20 percent over the average 
subsonic fare. In this domain, the Europeans have the advantage 
of all their technological experience with the Concorde, while 
the Japanese have the financial resources and desire to work in 
the most advanced technologies, and the Americans have a fierce 
determination not to let Europe continue enjoying a monopoly in 
this field! 
  Besides the benefits presented by cooperation in civil 
aeronautics, Japan also has enormous potential in the military 
domain. Little by little, Japanese military defense spending has 
steadily grown. It has now even outstripped France's [military] 
budget, one of the largest in the world. With the recession, 
Japan has slowed down the growth in its defense spending, which 
is virtually pegged to Gross Domestic Product). The military 
budget each year is equal to about 1 percent of GDP. 
  For fiscal 1994, the Defense Agency's budget is equal to 
about Fr250 billion (4,730 billion yen), up 1.95 percent over 
1993. The Navy fares best (up 3.5 percent) in the current 
budget, since Army spending has increased only 2.9 percent and 
the Air Force is suffering a 2.8 percent cutback. 
  Japan's commitment to self-reliance in arms manufacturing 
presents certain opportunities to European and French 
industries. That explains the initiative of 20 French 
enterprises that sent a mission of 30 engineers to Tokyo late 
last year as part of a delegation led by GIFAS [French 
Aeronautics and Space Industries Group]. The purpose: to 
introduce the most advanced French technologies and persuade the 
Japanese to quit thinking of the United States as their only 
possible industrial partner. 
  In the field of helicopters, for example, Japan will soon be 
facing two important decisions. The first concerns a medium-size 
transport helicopter eventually to be equipped with rocket 
launchers. Eurocopter is offering the Cougar, to be built in 
partnership with Kawasaki, which if the deal goes through would 
build it in the archipelago under license. The competition is 
Sikorski, which in partnership with Mitsubishi is offering the 
Black Hawk. A decision is expected in March 1994. The order 
could be for as many as 40 of the craft. 
<H5>  Helicopter Market </H5>
  The other major decision concerns the OHX observation 
helicopter, 100 of which are to be built. This would be a 
helicopter designed and manufactured entirely in Japan, with 
Kawasaki as prime contractor and engines provided by Mitsubishi. 
Many French outfitters are competing to equip the Japanese 
craft. Sextant Avionics, in partnership with a Japanese 
licensee, would be among the best placed to succeed. 
  In general, French industry is following closely the efforts 
of Japanese industry to break free of reliance on the Americans. 
The latter are chary--and we would be no less cautious--about 
turning over their technology, and they intend to continue 
keeping a close eye on new Japanese developments. This is the 
case too in the domain of warplanes. In the FSX program, the 
airframe is being built in partnership with Lockheed and the 
engines in partnership with General Electric. GE has agreed to 
let Ishikawajima Harima (IHI) manufacture the F110 GE engine 
under license, but the US Government and Congress have refused 
to lift restrictions on some technologies incorporated into the 
engine. Mitsubishi has completed fabrication of the first left 
wing built entirely of composites. Lockheed is building the 
right wing. Japan is also working on countermeasures for the 
FSX. Besides its own electronic defense system, the Japanese 
craft will benefit from protection provided by a specialized 
aircraft. This is the F-15 J, which would carry an 
ultra-powerful countermeasures system (using active-antenna 
radar) in a nacelle housing. 
  Overall, Japan's technological needs will continue growing. 
Anxious about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and the 
increasing power of China, Japan cannot afford to lower its 
guard. Numerous psychological and juridical obstacles must still 
be overcome before Japan plays a more active role in the Asian 
region. Indeed, as recently as last December Keisuke Nakanishi, 
director general of the Japanese Defense Agency (and 
quasi-defense minister), was forced to step down because he was 
a little too quick in calling for revision of the 50-year-old 
law that determines Japan's defense posture. He wanted Japan to 
be able to respond pragmatically to the demands of the post-Cold 
War period. But in the meantime there's nothing to stop Japan 
from developing areas of excellence in defense electronics and 
space technology. So its advances and innovations will need to 
be followed attentively.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "France Prefers Beijing </F>
to Taiwan"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] To restore relations with mainland China, where it 
hopes to open up civilian markets in which Aerospatiale is well 
positioned, Paris will curb arms deliveries to the Nationalist 
island... 
  Alternation in the political sphere is also having its 
effect 
on French foreign policy. In a 180-degree change of course, the 
government is turning its back on Taiwan and normalizing 
relations with Beijing. It is thus putting behind it a 
Franco-Chinese estrangement stemming from the 1982 sale of 60 
Mirage 2000-5 to Formosa, and is meeting the PRC's two 
conditions: recognition of Beijing as the "sole legal government 
of China, and recognition of Taiwan as an integral part of 
Chinese territory." In addition, it is promising "in future not 
to authorize French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan." 
  The Chinese for their part have not committed to much in 
return for all this "kowtowing" (or grovelling, as one expert in 
Franco-Chinese relations calls it). They merely declare that 
"French enterprises will be welcome to compete in the Chinese 
market on an equal footing." In other words, the Chinese agree 
to recognize as applying to France a trading privilege that 
exists with respect to every country with which our country 
maintains diplomatic relations. 
  The news has had a mixed reception in aeronautical circles. 
Firms currently filling arms contracts with Taiwan are clearly 
somewhat nervous about how the Nationalists will react. But for 
the moment it appears they have nothing to fear. Taipei does not 
appear keen to retaliate by voiding current contracts, and 
Beijing is not insisting on their cancellation. Dassault, 
SNECMA, Thomson, and Matra will thus be able to fulfill their 
30-billion-franc [Fr] contract. Similarly, arming of the six La 
Fayette class frigates built by DCN [Directorate of Naval 
Shipbuilding] at Lorient is expected to continue. The primary 
beneficiaries of that contract, valued at between Fr10-15 
billion, are Thomson-CSF (battle system, Crotale naval missile), 
Matra (Mistral missile), and Aerospatiale (Exocet). But 
notwithstanding the government's assertion of the right to 
continue selling arms to Taiwan--so long as Beijing does not 
consider them "offensive"--doubts persist regarding the future 
of the big contract (an option for nine more frigates) and 
prospects for other deals such as submarines, armored vehicles, 
a second tranche of Mirage 2000, and a complement of Mica for 
Matra. 
  However, the news was received with a measure of 
satisfaction 
in civil aeronautics circles. Particularly at Airbus Industrie, 
which has just expanded its Beijing office. As pointed out by 
the consortium and its French partner Aerospatiale, dialogue 
with the Chinese buyers will be greatly facilitated. The 
partners hope, for example, to close the gap with Boeing, which 
has already placed 250 of its commercial jets--compared to only 
about 30 Airbus (and some 20 to Taiwan)--in a market estimated 
at 600 aircraft between now and the year 2005. Louis Gallois, 
Aerospatiale's CEO, has a lot of hopes riding on the ATR-42/72 
regional air transport, which he sees as "perfectly adapted to 
the Chinese market." All the same, it has not been ordered yet 
by any airline on the continent, despite the fact Beijing is 
participating in fabrication, whereas 18 of them are flying the 
colors of the Nationalists' Trans Asia Airways, formerly Foshing 
Airlines. Also in the civilian aeronautics sector, the robust 
growth in air traffic means air traffic control systems will 
have to be modernized and airports expanded, opening up major 
opportunities for Thomson-CSF and Aeroport de Paris. The Chinese 
have already purchased several dozen TB-20 from Socata for 
training their airline pilots. 
  The situation is less clear in the defense sector. The few 
contracts signed in the past have not been renewed. There was an 
order for Rasit radars from Thomson, for 13 Super Frelon, for 
eight Super Puma (some of them put to civilian uses), for eight 
Ecureuils, eight Gazelles armed with Hot antitank missiles, 
several batteries of Crotale missiles (which some people believe 
were used to develop an equivalent indigenous system), and the 
first phase of modernization of the A-5 fighter-bombers 
(formerly MiG-19) by Thomsen and Sagem. The only success story 
to stand the test of time is the fabrication of 50 Dauphin under 
license, with Ariel engines provided by Turbomeca. The French 
opening is expected to give a boost to Eurocopter's current 
negotiations for a new series and strengthen cooperation on the 
EC-120 light helicopter.

  [Text] Nakayama Steel Works, Ltd. has developed and made 
practical a ``non-breeze sintered iron ore,'' a sintered iron 
ore, which is one of the main raw materials for blast furnaces, 
produced without using breeze (pulverized coke). The system is 
one in which metallic iron powder is used as an energy source 
instead of breeze to sinter pulverized iron ore, and the 
generation of CO[.sup]2[/] and NO[.sub]X[/] can be 
controlled to a great extent. Facilities for the process have 
already been built at the Nakayama Plant (Osaka), and start-up 
work is in progress. Actual operation will begin in April 1994. 
From the beginning, this was seen as being useful for reduction 
in energy consumption and improvement in the environment, but it 
is also seen as helping with recycling of scrap and waste steel 
from blast furnaces. Since this is the world's first example of 
this technology, it is drawing attention. 
  Sintered iron ore is produced by sintering iron ore with 
breeze, but during sintering, C0[.sup]2[/], NO[.sub]X[/] 
and sulfides are produced, and there are environmental problems. 
  The method developed by Nakayama Steel Works sinters 
metallic 
iron powder instead of breeze. The process is one in which the 
energy when metallic iron with a metallization ratio 
20-70% 
comes in contact with high-temperature air is used and iron ore 
is sintered. The main points are that high temperature exhaust 
gas of 200C to 300C is used, the ignition temperature 
of the powdered iron made uniform and the process speeded up. 
  In this way iron ore can be sintered homogeneously, and the 
amount of iron powder can be reduced. In addition, it is said 
that the sintered ore obtained from this process has excellent 
reduction and cold strength. 
  The newly completed facility consists of a hot blast unit 
for 
recycling the high-temperature portion of gas exhausted from the 
sintering process and a wet electrostatic precipitator for 
purifying the exhaust gas. This facility makes for a large 
reduction in NO[.sup]X[/] in the exhaust gas. In addition, 
the amounts of sulfides and C0[.sup]2[/] exhausted are near 
zero, so this one step toward the realization of a clean steel 
works. 
  The material for the iron powder used here is the portion of 
the waste iron generated by the blast furnace that cannot be 
used as raw material for an electric steel furnace, so there is 
the merit of recycling. In addition, not using breeze there 
results in a reduction of more than 200 million in annual costs.

  [Text] Countermeasures for waste oxides of nitrogen 
(NO[.sup]X[/]) generated by fixed sources such as power 
plants and mobile sources such as automobiles have gradually 
become more stringent, but in metropolitan areas like Tokyo, 
Osaka and Kanagawa, the NO[.sup]X[/] concentration has not 
been reduced, and in areas around roads, concentrations of 
nitrogen dioxide often do not comply with environmental 
standards (Figure 1). The reasons for this are the absolute 
increase in traffic, delay of NO[.sup]X[/] countermeasures 
and the increase in the proportion of vehicles with diesel 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-13A>           Figure 1. Condition of Environmental Standards for NO[.sup]2[/] At Automobile Exhaust Measurement Stations </FIG>

engines. Along with emphasizing the development of 
NO[.sup]X[/] reduction technology, the Environment Agency has 
promulgated the "Act for Special Measures Concerning the 
Reduction of Total Emissions of NO[.sup]X[/] from Vehicles in 
Specified Areas" and is aiming at the reduction of 
NO[.sup]X[/] concentrations. 



  In addition to these countermeasures, there have been 
various 
proposals for development of technology for cleaning 
environments with high concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/], but 
the main roads of metropolitan areas have become more 
multilayered and complex each year and creation of tunnels for 
new roads is progressing. The exhaust from these large-scale 
tunnels contains more than 1ppm of NO[.sup]X[/], and 
elimination of NO[.sup]X[/] from large amounts of exhaust is 
expected to help in improving the environment in these areas. At 
present, processes in which silica gel and zeolite are used as 
dry absorbents and ammonia is used for reduction processing are 
being examined. However, the processing equipment for this 
method is very large, and the energy and cost required for 
operation are estimated to be very large. 
<H5>  Why Attention Was Drawn to Photocatalysts </H5>
  As one study on the behavior of NO[.sup]X[/] in the 
atmosphere, the authors examined the NO[.sup]2[/] absorbency 
and reactivity of soil particles and the metal oxide particles 
that compose them in relation to photochemical air pollution and 
acid rain. The absorbency of NO[.sup]2[/] itself was not so 
large, but we obtained interesting results concerning the 
absorption using incident light and the increase in nitric acid 
produced (Table 1). Among the metal oxides that were examined, 
titanium dioxide (TiO[.sup]2[/], which is present in soil 
particles at around 1%), which has photosemiconductivity, 
exhibited a large effect with incident light, and we found out 
that NO[.sup]2[/] was oxidized to create nitric acid. Nitric 
acid is more easily absorbed by solids, has greater dissolution 
in water and is more easily processed using absorbents and 
absorbent liquids than NO[.sup]X[/]. Therefore, we thought of 
actively using the photocatalytic operation of these 
photosemiconductive particles in the elimination of the sub-ppm 
level of NO[.sup]X[/] in the atmosphere.

<H5>  NO </H5>
[.sup]X[/] Elimination Capacity of Photocatalysts 
  As is shown conceptually in Figure 2, the electrons of 
photosemiconductive metal oxides like TiO[.sup]2[/] shift 
(excitation) to the conduction band from the valence band when 
light with an energy higher than the band gap (difference in 
energy between the valence band and the conduction band) is 
incident to them, and particles (holes) with a positive charge 
are generated in the valence band. A part of the electrons and 
holes are dispersed on the surface of the oxide particle, and 
the electrons are involved in reduction reactions and the holes 
in oxidation reactions. TiO[.sup]2[/] is a semiconductor 
excited by ultraviolet light (360nm or lower) and is an 
photocatalyst with great oxidative power; we conducted our 
search for a catalyst for processing NO[.sup]X[/] centered on 
this. 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-14A> Figure 2. Generation of Electrons and Holes Through Light </FIG>
 Absorption by Semiconductors Like TiO[.sup]2[/] 




<H5>  1. Experimental Methods </H5>
  The experimental system shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced] is 
composed of a flow-through photo reaction unit, reaction gas 
control unit and analytical unit. The reaction tube is a silica 
glass tube with fine glass powder sintered to the surface, and 
about 250mg (0.8ml) of the catalytic powder is applied to this; 
after being baked in air over night, this was placed in the 
central glass tube. The catalyst on the surface of the reaction 
tube was illuminated using 12 blacklights (wavelength 
300-400nm). The reaction gas was air that included 1-2ppm of 
NO[.sup]X[/], and humidity was controlled (dry to 70%) 
using a humidifier; the reaction was carried out continuously for five 
hours at a flow rate of 0.5l per minute. During this time, the 
concentration of NO[.sup]X[/] (NO and NO[.sub]2[/]) in the 
reaction gas was monitored continuously by a chemiluminescence 
nitrogen oxide meter. After the experiment was completed, the 
reaction tube was removed and cleaned ultrasonically in pure 
water, and the pH and nitric acid ion 
(NO[.sup]3[/][.sup]-[/]) concentration measured. 
<H3>  2. 
NO </H3>
[.sup]X[/] Elimination Activity of the Photocatalyst 
  As can be predicted from Table 1, TiO[.sup]2[/] exhibited 
a high NO oxidation activity, but about 30% of the NO was 
released into the gas phase as NO[.sup]2[/], and we can see 
that this is not a sufficient catalyst from the standpoint of 
NO[.sup]X[/] elimination. Using something that absorbs 
NO[.sup]2[/] well can be thought of as sufficient for 
avoiding the release of NO[.sup]2[/], and we took a look at 
mixing activated carbon (AC), which can be expected to absorb 
NO[.sup]2[/] with TIO[.sub]2[/]. 
  Table 2 shows the amounts of NO and NO[.sup]2[/] 
eliminated and the amount of nitric acid produced when reaction 
gas that included 1.6ppm of NO[.sup]2[/] was used with 
TiO[.sup]2[/], AC and TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC. When there was no 
illumination, it was clear that (1) AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC 
eliminated NO[.sup]2[/], (2) generation of NO actively 
occurred with AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC and (3) little nitric 
acid was generated with any sample (no NO[.sup]2[/] 
oxidation). On the other hand, when there is illumination, (1) 
there was a large change in the activity of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC, 
and the generation of NO was inhibited and nitric acid 
production hastened, but (2) there was almost no change in the 
activity of AC. The elimination of NO[.sup]2[/] and 
generation of NO by AC is assumed to be reduction of 
NO[.sup]2[/] to NO when absorbed by AC. On the other hand, 
both the oxidation of NO to NO[.sup]2[/] and the oxidation of 
NO[.sup]2[/] to nitric acid (HNO[.sub]3[/]) occur on the 
surface of TiO[.sup]2[/], and this is related to the 
generation of various types of active oxygen (0, 0[.sup]-[/], 
OH, etc.) on the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface when illuminated. The 
nitric acid generated is caught by the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface, 
but the ability of TiO[.sup]2[/] to absorb NO[.sub]2[/] is 
low and part of the NO[.sup]2[/] is thought to be released as 
a gas. The reason that the release of NO[.sup]2[/] is 
inhibited by mixing TiO[.sup]2[/] and AC can be understood as 
there being time for NO[.sup]2[/] to be caught by AC and the 
NO[.sup]2[/] to be oxidized to HNO[.sub]3[/]. Figure 3 
shows the mechanism for NO[.sup]X[/] elimination using the 
TiO[.sup]2[/] photocatalyst.

  If a small amount (1-3 wt%) of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
is added to this catalyst (TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC), there is a 
large increase in the NO[.sup]X[/] elimination activity. The 
results are summarized in Table 3, but in comparison with 
TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC, elimination of NO with a TiO[.sub]2[/]- 
AC-Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](I) catalyst is about double, 
and there is a 30% or more increase in nitric acid 
production. TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) is made by 
mechanically mixing commercially available 
Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder with TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC 
and adjusting it, but the nitric acid production is two times 
that of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC. Since Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
itself does not exhibit much photocatalytic activity and the 
optimal addition is 1-3 wt%, Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] is a 
auxiliary catalyst, and it can be thought of as playing a role 
in promoting the attachment of NO and NO[.sup]2[/] to the 
catalytic surface (see Figure 3).

  4) The numbers 1, 2 and 3 are the number of times the same

<H5>  3. Properties of the Photocatalyst Developed </H5>
  The properties of this TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC- 
Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) catalyst are as follows: 
  (1) The reaction occurs at room temperature, and sunlight 
can 
be used (wavelength: 300nm-360nm). 
  (2) Special reaction materials (ammonia, ozone, etc.) are 
not 
needed (NO[.sup]X[/] oxidation uses atmospheric oxygen and 
the electrons and holes generated on the surface of 
TiO[.sup]2[/]). 
  (3) It has a high activity for directly oxidizing low 
concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/] (nitric acid production), and 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-15B>           Figure 4. Applications of Photocatalytic </FIG>

nitric acid is caught by the surface. 
  (4) Regeneration of the catalyst is easy (water wash: see 
numbers (1)-(3) in Table 3). 
  (5) Easy adjustment (mechanical mixing of the three 
components). 
  (6) Changes in catalytic activity due to relative humidity 
are small. 
  (7) TiO[.sup]2[/], activated carbon and 
Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] are available in large quantities 
and are not expensive. 
<H5>  Toward NO </H5>
[.sup]X[/] Elimination Applications of the 
Photocatalyst 
  We have shown that oxidative elimination of NO[.sup]X[/] 
using a photocatalyst centered on TiO[.sup]2[/] can be 
effectively carried out, but in order to use this catalyst in 
the cleaning of tunnel exhaust as in Figure 4, a system that can 
process large volumes of exhaust gas must be constructed. On the 
other hand, in cases in which an open atmosphere is the object, 
as with street canyons (environments that include roads 
surrounded on both sides with tall buildings in which the 
concentrations of pollutants like NO[.sup]X[/] are high), 
there is a need for appropriate placing of the photocatalyst in 
the environment. 



<H3>  1. Cleaning of Closed Atmospheres Like Tunnels (Using 
Artificial Light) </H3>
  The small reaction unit shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced] 
was 
insufficient for obtaining the necessary data for designing a 
system for processing tunnel exhaust, and experiments were 
started using a large scale unit produced jointly with Fuji 
Electric Co., Ltd. On the inside surface of the cylindrical 
reaction chamber (1.5m x 0.2m) in the middle of Photo 2 
[not 
reproduced], 20-30g of catalyst was applied, and illumination 
provided by an internal fluorescent lamp. Reaction gas 
containing several ppm of NO[.sup]X[/] passes through an 
electrostatic precipitator from the inlet at the far left, at a 
rate of several meters of gas per minute. Part of the results 
are shown in Figure 5, but in a reaction chamber (basic type) in 
which the gas passes straight through, with a flow of 2m per 
minute, the rate of elimination is low at 10%. On the 
other 
hand, the data shown by solid black circles is that obtained for 
a reactor set up with a circular cone shaped screen, and there 
is a great improvement in NO elimination. We can see that when 
the gas flow is large, it is important to improve the contact of 
the gas with the catalyst, inclusive of the time of contact. 
Research on developing systems, including reaction tube length 
and diameter and light intensity, aimed at practical 
applications is continuing. 



<H3>  2. Atmospheric Cleaning for Open Systems Such as Highways 
(Using Sunlight) </H3>
  It is not easy to use sunlight in tunnels, but it is 
possible 
with open systems such as highways. In such cases, the energy 
for artificial lighting is unnecessary, and we can expect energy 
efficient economical NO[.sup]X[/] elimination systems. 
However, since it is difficult to apply powdered photocatalysts 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-16A>           Figure 5. Evaluation of NO Elimination Performance </FIG>

to the surfaces of sound absorption panels on highways and the 
surfaces of buildings and not have exfoliation over the long 
term, it is necessary to create panels and set them up. 
  What was developed for this were the sheet catalysts shown 
in 
Photo 3 [not reproduced]. A fluorine-contained resin powder and 
the photocatalyst were mixed, and these were formed by rolling. 
Experiments comparing the two 10 x 10 cm sheets continually 
exposed to a flow of 0.5l per minute of air containing NO for 12 
hours were conducted. With an atmosphere with a 0.05-2ppm NO 
concentration, it was confirmed that almost all of the NO was 
eliminated. The NO elimination rate decreases with the time of 
use of these sheet catalysts, but if they are washed with water 
the activity is completely recovered. There are many small holes 
in the fluorine-contained resin used to form the sheets, and, it 
was shown that starting with NO, gasses and water are easily 
diffused within the sheet, osmosis takes place, and there was 
sufficient contact with the catalyst. In addition, when these 
sheets are exposed to outside air for a long time, a large 
amount of nitric acid is recovered, so it was confirmed that the 
photocatalyst works with sunlight. From here on, we plan to move 
forward with evaluation and research on helping to develop a 
high activity, durable catalyst, determining how much the 
photocatalyst can contribute to NO[.sup]X[/] elimination at 
actual sites such as highways and determining on what scale 
there is a need for using the photocatalyst in order to make a 
contribution. 
  While there is a great deal of basic research at present on 
breakdown and elimination of pollutants using photocatalysts, 
there are very few that have actually been offered for use. 
Since photocatalyst technology for elimination of pollutants 
that does not require thermal energy and does not use reaction 
materials like ammonia is technology that is in harmony with 
environmental protection, we plan to promote research and 
development with the goal of reducing materials that cause air 
pollution, starting with NO[.sup]X[/]. The sheet 
photocatalyst that was developed, has the merit of easy 
"separation on contact with water," which was difficult with the 
earlier powdered photocatalyst, and there are expectations for 
applications in the processing of water pollutants and 
high-level processing of water.

  [Text] Toshiba Corp. (Fumio Sato, president) announced on 
19 November that it has developed a small superconductor magnet 
without using liquid helium, by commercializing a refrigerating 
machine that can cool to the temperature of liquid helium 
(absolute temperature of 4.2K=-269C). Since 
conventional refrigeration machines have not been able to go 
below 10K, niobium titanium superconductor magnets could 
not be used, but since with this new refrigeration machine 
cooling to 4.2K is possible and the container is 
approximately one-third the size of conventional ones, it is 
possible to generate a strong magnetic field of six tesla in a 
large diameter room temperature space, which has an internal 
diameter of 18 cm. Toshiba believes that there will be a great 
expansion in the fields using superconductor magnets. 
  The superconductor magnet system that was developed 
incorporates a small refrigeration machine that is an 
improvement on the Gifford-McMahon (GM) type refrigeration 
machines that are most commonly in use at present. Since 
conventional refrigeration machines could not cool below 
10K, niobium 3-tin, etc. had to be used, but by finding 
regenerative materials with large specific heats below 10K, 
Toshiba was able to attain cooling in the 4K range. 
  In addition, an oxide superconductor which has low thermal 
conductivity and in which current flows well in a strong 
magnetic field is used for the power lead that brings current to 
the superconductor coil, and this is connected to the reduction 
in cooling temperature. 
  With this it is possible to use the main current niobium 
titanium superconductor magnet, for which liquid helium cooling 
had been necessary, with a direct cooling refrigeration machine, 
and a strong magnetic field can be generated with a small unit. 
  The container that accommodates the magnetic field is 65 cm 
wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, a small size about that of a 25 
inch television set, and all that must be done when it is used 
is to turn on a switch. 
  Toshiba says that almost all superconductor magnets, such as 
those for industry and research, can use this refrigeration 
machine, and it will release users from the complexity of using 
liquid helium cooling.

  [Text] The Semiconductor Technology Center of Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. developed the world's first 
surface-emission laser optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC) 
which can operate 10 times as fast as a conventional matrix-type 
surface-emission laser. The center designed a unique system in 
which transistors are mounted on lasers (transistor-on-laser) 
and lined up 64 lasers in an array-formation in a cell that is a 
480 micron square. Each laser has a built-in transistor as its 
driver. As a result, this accomplishment makes 10 gigahertz 
high-speed operations functionally possible and it will open up 
the way to the attainment of optical computers and optical 
switchboards. 
  Innovations in the CPU [Central Processing Unit] and such 
have advanced the speed of computers. However, transmission 
delays become a problem when there is an interchange among them 
on networks. It has been pointed out that there are limits to 
the present method used to amplify the signal by converting 
optical communications into electricity. 
  Therefore, there is a strong need for optical switches and 
such which will make ultra high speed circuitry possible for the 
switching of optical signals, without conversion, between 
optical fibers. The surface-emission laser is expected to be one 
of the basic technologies to make this possible. 
  Although a chip has been developed which has integrated over 
a thousand elements in the surface-emission laser, the 
conventional product uses a matrix form of circuitry which needs 
a large electric current to change the frequency of the laser. 
Moreover, the circuit distance from the driver transistor is so 
great that it makes high-speed operations difficult. 
  In this instance, the device developed by Matsushita 
Electric 
has 64 0.98 nanometer wavelength surface-emission lasers each 
integrated with a driver transistor. This structure uses a 
unique method of putting the transistor on top of the laser. By 
doing this, Matsushita made it possible to increase the 
high-speed operations to more than 10 times that of the 
matrix-type and also made it possible to increase the density 
and reduce the area to one third of the latter type. A special 
quality is that it is feasible to increase the speed up of 10 
gigahertz and it is expected that this development will 
drastically promote the utilization of optical computers and 
optical switches.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation has developed a 
semiconductor laser for a home optical communications system. 
This new laser operates at high temperatures at low current and 
emits in the 1.3 band with high reliability. Because the 
laser provides stable operation even at high temperatures, there 
is no need for a cooler to control the temperature, which will 
lead to greater compactness and lower costs. Sample shipments 
will begin in January 1994, and Mitsubishi plans to produce 
10,000 units per month beginning in April. The sample price will 
be &yen;10,000. 
  The operating current at high temperatures is only about 70 
mA, which is half the current required by previous semiconductor 
lasers, and the threshold current for laser emission is 20 mA, 
which is only three-fifths that of previous models. Thanks to 
this reduction in operating current, Mitsubishi says that the 
unit will maintain stable operation at 85C with an optical 
output of 10 mW for an estimated 20,000 hours or longer. 
  Semiconductor lasers are used as light sources in optical 
communications, but they get very hot from the heat produced by 
nearby electrical circuits. Because the semiconductor lasers 
used in intercity trunk line systems have operating currents 
exceeding 100 mA at high temperatures, the lasers deteriorate 
from the high current. 
  Therefore, when a communications system with an optical 
fiber 
line running to each house is created in the future, a 
semiconductor laser with high reliability and low operating 
current will be needed.

Makino; Microwave Tube Division, NEC] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  NEC has already developed high efficiency klystrons with 
outputs of 30 kW and 80 kW (jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries) in the 2.45 GHz frequency band as microwave sources 
in microwave power systems that require high output and high 
efficiency. Now NEC has developed a high-wattage, 
high-efficiency klystron with an output of 100 kW and an 
efficiency of 76%, the world's best, as the 
top-of-the-line 
model of this product series. 
  Because the electron beam bunching efficiency is 
dramatically 
improved in this klystron, for two of the seven cavity 
resonators we used higher harmonic cavity resonators coupled to 
the 2nd harmonic. We also selected a relatively small perveance 
and optimized the positions of the various cavities. 
  Furthermore, along with high power, this klystron features 
excellent power resistance and output stability, and it is 
lightweight, compact, and has a long product life. 
  This article describes points that were given special 
consideration during the design stage in developing this 
klystron and the properties that were obtained. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Recently microwaves are being used in industry for heating, 
drying, baking, sintering, etc., and in fields such as medicine, 
environmental protection and energy. The microwave sources in 
these microwave power systems must have high output, high 
efficiency, and high reliability. 
  Magnetrons that have been used up till now have a low 
maximum 
single-tube output of about 15 kW, and they are also relatively 
short-lived. Klystrons, on the other hand, have a large 
single-tube output, excellent frequency stability, and are 
better in terms of lifetime as well, so klystrons have received 
a great deal of attention as replacements for magnetrons. 
  In response to these needs, NEC has already developed 
high-efficiency klystrons with outputs of 30 kW and 80 kW 
(jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) in the 2.45 GHz 
frequency band.[.sup]1[/] To answer the need for greater 
power and higher efficiency, NEC has developed the world's first 
klystron that features a high output of 100 kW, an efficiency of 
better than 75%, and a long product life. This product is 
discussed below. 
<H5>  2. Design Policy </H5>
  In designing the high-efficiency klystron with a high power 
output of 100 kW, we made a comprehensive design of the main 
parts--the electron gun, high-frequency circuit and 
collector--on the high-precision CAD developed in house at NEC. 
The following points were given special consideration during 
design. 
  (1) Cooling 
  We planned to use the same water-cooled format for the 
collector that we used in the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons, but 
because the power loss at the collector would be increased to 
about 150 kW, it would be necessary to use a large volume of 
water to cool the collector, and if we did not change the 
collector structure, the pressure loss in the cooling system 
would be too great. 
  Moreover, it was also necessary to reduce pressure loss so 
we 
could make the device more compact. Therefore, we studied 
designs for the klystron collector cooling system that would 
allow us to maintain cooling efficiency while holding pressure 
loss in the cooling system to a minimum. 
  (2) High Voltage Resistance 
  We decided on a relatively small perveance in this klystron, 
so that meant the beam voltage would be quite high. Therefore, 
we had to consider ways to maintain the voltage resistance of 
the electron gun. 
  (3) Beam Shape 
  It is essential to obtain a uniform, rod-shaped beam with 
laminar flow in order to maintain stability during high-output 
operation. Therefore, we studied the electrode shape and 
magnetic circuit shape to realize the proper beam shape. 
  (4) High-Frequency Circuit 
  We designed the length of the high-frequency circuit based 
on 
the electrical circuit lengths of the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons. 
Furthermore, to hold down heat generation in the drift tubes 
that accompanies such high output, we optimized the shapes of 
the drift tubes. 
  Generally, if we increase the OD and the wall thickness of a 
drift tube, the cavity impedance R/Q will drop. As a result, our 
target efficiency is difficult to realize. Therefore, we 
considered how to make the R/Q value the same as in the 30 kW 
and 80 kW klystrons that we had already made. 
  (5) Long Life and Reliability 
  Generally, the life of the microwave tube is dependent on 
the 
life of the cathode that emits the electron beam. Therefore, we 
studied how to create a long-lived, highly-reliable cathode and 
adopted those modifications in this klystron. 
  Next we determined the objective characteristics for this 
klystron as shown in Table 1. We set the operating frequency 
band at 2.45 GHz, which is the ISM band (Industrial, Scientific, 
and Medical), set output at 100 kW or better, and efficiency at 
75% or better. Further, we considered the capability of 
the 
input pre-stage solid-state amplifier, and set a target gain of 
48 dB or more. On the other hand, we also wanted the device to 
be constructed so it would produce the specified characteristics 
without adjustment when it was installed to facilitate 
maintenance and replacement operations. As far as cooling was 
concerned, we used water cooling for the body and the 
electromagnets, and forced air cooling for the electron gun.

<H5>  Electrical Design and Structural Design </H5>
  Below we explain the major items involved in the electrical 
design of the electron gun section, high-frequency current 
section and collector section, and in the structural designl. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-20A>           Fig.1 Stimulation of Electron Beam Trajectory </FIG>


   3.1 Electron Gun Section 
  With respect to perveance, which is an important parameter 
for the klystron, because there are problems with space-charge 
strength and velocity scattering, it is generally advantageous 
to have a low perveance value to focus the beam more easily and 
increase efficiency. On the other hand, there are disadvantages 
in terms of voltage resistance and compactness because the 
voltage is higher and the high-frequency circuit must be longer. 
  Naturally, for the sake of compactness, the lower the beam 
voltage the better. We studied this overall problem and settled 
for a perveance of 0.5A/V[.sup]3/2[/]. Therefore, because 
of the relationship between output and effectiveness, the beam 
voltage became 38.5 kVdc. 
  The parameters of the electron gun are shown in Table 2. To 
obtain stable operation, it was necessary to increase voltage 
resistance between the electrodes and obtain an electron beam 
with laminar flow that has few ripples. Therefore, we used 
computer simulations to determine the cathode diameter, electron 
beam focusing ratio, distance between electrodes, and the design 
of the electromagnetic circuit that creates the magnetic field 
for focusing. Figure 1 shows the electron beam trajectory 
obtained by computer simulation. The ripple rate of this 
electron beam was an extremely small 1.5%, and thus we 
obtained 
an excellent electron beam.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 








  Generally, the greater the power the bigger the collector 
that captures the electron beam. We used the CAD to optimize the 
shape of the collector so that it will capture the electron beam 
with greatest efficiency, and this enabled us to make it more 
compact overall. 
  We used the same water-cooling format that we used on the 30 
kW and 80 kW klystrons. Generally, as the Reynolds number gets 
higher the convective heat transfer between the collector and 
the cooling water improves and cooling efficiency increases. On 
the other hand, however, pressure loss also increases. In this 
100 kW klystron we computed the optimal cooling grooves on the 
collector for maximum cooling efficiency with minimum pressure 
loss and were able to design a very small collector. 
<H5>  4. Performance </H5>
  Table 4 shows the operating characteristics of the klystron. 
The input/output properties under the operating conditions in 
Table 4 are shown in Figure 4. At a frequency of 2.45 GHz we 
obtained an output of more than 100 kW, a power gain of 50.5 dB, 
and under saturated output operation, a conversion efficiency of 
76%. These were nearly identical to the computed values 
predicted by the CAD. Moreover, as far as weight is concerned, 
we were able to make the device compact and lightweight at about 
60 kg. Cooling the collector requires a flow volume of 150 L/min 
of cooling water, and the pressure loss is a small value of 2.0 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/] or less.

<H3>  Transistor Can Function at Room Temperature up to 2V Drain 
Voltage </H3>
  According to Toshiba, its latest experimental nMOS 
transistor 
is said to ``function at the normal level'' equal to that of the 
0.5-micron-long gate transistor in terms of current voltage 
characteristics at room temperature. 
  First of all, with respect to nMOS's drain current-gate 
voltage characteristics, even if drain voltage is raised to 2V, 
current quickly responds to this with precipitous rise, 
confirming the fact it is equipped with a function to increase 
width as a transistor. Secondly, as for the nMOS's properties of 
drain current and drain voltage, it has been confirmed that when 
source voltage is set at .1.5V , if gate voltage is below 0.6V, 
drain current will not flow (in other words, it has a cut-off 
property); also saturation characteristics has been confirmed 
for drain voltage. 
  As for breakdown voltage by [punch-through], it was possible 
to obtain 3.5V, comfortably topping the 1.5V which is equivalent 
to the upper limit of power source voltage with current gate 
length. An increase in drain current resulting from 
[punch-through] was said to have been observed at around 4V. 
This was due to the 10nm-deep shallow junction formed through 
[punch through]. With a 30nm-deep junction, because of the 
[punch-through], the transistor cannot be activated below the 
0.5V level. 
<H5>  To Get Around the Problem of Short Channel, Hot Carrier </H5>
  With Toshiba's latest nMOS transistor, it became possible to 
make change in threshold voltage and suppress lowering of S 
factor (the inverse number of subthreshold current inclination). 
Hot carrier effect is said to be minimum. 
  First of all, with respect to change in threshold voltage by 
short channel effect, the threshold voltage for the 1.5V drain 
voltage was controlled at below -0.16V through shortening of a 
gate length from 1 micron to 0.04 micron. This compares 
favorably with the case in which change of 0.1 V was obtained by 
shortening a gate length from 1 micron to 0.1 micron by using 
existing impurity-diffusion technology. As for the S factor, 
although inferior to 80mV/[keta], still it was able to obtain 
100mV/[keta]. 
  Toshiba found that it was difficult to generate hot carriers 
with the nMOS transistor. Measurement of impact-ionization ratio 
and drain voltage dependency of substrate current indicated that 
in both cases drain voltage plummeted to below 1.5V. Since this 
drain voltage of 1.5 V is very close to Si's energy gap of 1.1 
V, it stands to reason that not many hot carriers will be 
generated under such conditions. Moreover, the energy level of 
most hot carriers generated( which is a low-probability event) 
in many cases tends to be low. For this reason, even if gate 
length becomes minute, effect of hot carriers will not be 
increased. 
  It was possible to improve the transistor's driving power 
even with a 0.04 micron gate. With a 0.1 micron transistor, 
improvements in both drain current and mutual conductance have 
been in the range of from 30 to 40%. This will put drain 
current at 600mA/mm and mutual conductance at 450mS/mm. It used 
to be that, if below 0.2 micron, because of speed saturation, it 
was not possible to improve drive capability by miniaturization. 
However, the results of Toshiba's new transistor undermines this 
thinking. The company's plan for the immediate future will be to 
examine its mechanisms. 
<H5>  Gate Length 0.04 micron, Junction Depth 10 nm </H5>
  In order to prevent short channel effect, something which 
must be done in order to obtain Toshiba's new transistor 
characteristics, it is necessary to make a junction 10nm deep 
for the gate length of 0.04 micron. 
  In order to achieve the gate length of 0.04 micron, after 
the 
excimer laser has been exposed, a gate electrode was made still 
thinner using an isotropic [aciding]. Using the SEM measurement 
method, Toshiba verified the length of the gate to be 0.043 
micron after etching. 
  In order to obtain a shallow junction of 10nm, solid-phase P 
was diffused from a gate-side wall. The company used 1000C, 
10 seconds RTA (rapid thermal annealing) processing. Use of a 
solid-phase diffusion using RTA is a technique Toshiba has 
developed in order to develop a 0.1 micron pMOS transistor. In 
this case, Toshiba achieved a 40nm junction formation by 
diffusing B from BSG. On a Si substrate on which As is mounted, 
since P is inclined to be segregated more than B, Toshiba's 
thinking was that it would be easy to form a shallow junction. 
In the case of B, the company could not form the junction less 
shallow than 30nm. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-30A>           Fig. 3. Realizing Low Sheet Resistance Diffusion Layer </FIG>




  Distribution of impurity in the direction of depth was 
examined by measuring SIMS and sheet resistance. Using the SIMS 
analysis, the company was able to verify that distribution in a 
10nm zone was 10[.sup]18[/]/cm[.sup]3[/]. Sheet resistance 
was improved to achieve 
  An overall process flow consists of the following: 
  (1) formation of a field-separation oxidation film; 
  (2) mounting of B on channels; 
  (3) heat diffusion by a furnace unit; 
  (4) formation of an oxidation film of a 3nm-thick gate using 
800C oxidation; 
  (5) polycrystal Si film formation by adding P as impurity 
in-situ; 
  (6) exposure of the gate using excimer laser; 
  (7) processing designed to make resist thinner using 
aciding; 
  (8) etching of gate polycrystal Si using RIE; 
  (9) PSG film formation; 
  (10) formation of 190nm thick-side wall with RIE etchback; 
  (11) mounting of source- and drain-impurity As masking gate 
electrodes and side wall; 
  (12) RTA processing to achieve diffusion of solid-phase P 
forming a shallow junction of 10nm. 
<H5>  Realization of pMOS Problem of Future </H5>
  Future problems include realization of pMOS and suppression 
of parasitic capacity. According to Toshiba, the company is 
studying various methods, including solid-phase diffusion, to 
develop pMOS. However, since the solid-phase diffusion of B 
results in a junction as deep as 30nm, Toshiba feels that it 
should investigate other type of impurity.

<F P=106> [Article by Yosuke Mochizuki] </F>
  [Text] Toshibas's Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory has 
developed a KrF excimer laser featuring narrow bandwidth, long 
life, and high output. Its narrow spectral half-width is less 
than 1 pm, and its life-span and average output are equal to 
those of lasers mounted on cutting-edge excimer steppers, with 
the output capacity 8 W doubling that of the laser currently in 
use. Moreover, the initial costs of the laser as well as 
operational costs remain the same. This was achieved by a 
newly-developed resonator, which uses etalon as a narrow 
bandwidth element. The narrower bandwidth made it possible to 
reduce the degree of degradation of contrast produced by 
chromatic aberration, and this, in turn, made it easier to 
increase stepper lenses' numerical aperture (NA) to achieve the 
range, 0.55-0.6. Since the designing of lens is simplified, rise 
in stepper price resulting from higher NA can be compensated by 
the savings in design costs. 
  The 64M DRAM exposure technique employs the conventional i 
line lithography in a non-critical layer, and in a critical 
layer the technical trend is moving in the direction of the use 
of KrF excimer. Currently, two leading domestic companies are 
following this practice, that is at least in the first 
generation version. In the second generation version, a greater 
number of companies lists the KrF excimer as their first choice. 
  As is the case with i line lithography, NA (numerical 
aperture) of the KrF stepper needs to be enlarged as 
miniaturization progresses. However, under the present state of 
laser technology using diffraction grating in narrow-bandwidth 
region elements, spectral half-width of 2 pm is considered too 
large, causing the generation of chromatic aberration. 
Consequently, even if NA is increased, degradation in contrast 
will prevent a stable formation of minute patterns. (For further 
detail on this problem, please refer to this journal's May 1989 
issue, pp.70-80). If this problem is attacked by modifying the 
lens, the cost will be prohibitive. Generally speaking, the 
spectral width of 2 pm is sufficient to achieve NA 0.45. 
However, spectral widths of 1.5pm and 0.8 pm are considered 
necessary for NAs 0.55 and 0.6, respectively. In fact, the 
half-width of lasers used in the latest excimer stepper is plus 
or minus 2pm. The NA in this case is around 0.43, which still is 
lower than that of the leading i line steppers. 
<H5>  Elimination of Rate Controlling Factor for High N.A. </H5>
  The laser developed by Toshiba's Manufacturing Engineering 
Laboratory has a narrow spectral half-width of less than 1 pm 
(See Table 1 and Fig. 1). Its life-span is about the same as 
that of the laser mounted on the latest excimer stepper and its 
average output is 8W, twice that of the diffraction grating 
laser currently in use. By providing a narrow bandwidth zone, a 
rate controlling factor, an obstacle to achieving high NA, can 
be removed, making it possible to realize an optical system with 
NA ranging from 0.55 to 0.6 pm. Toshiba has accomplished this by 
using a newly developed resonator, in which etalon facing two 
silicon boards is used as a narrow bandwidth zone element. 
  According to Toshiba's trial calculations, the cost of 
lasers, along with initial and operational costs, is 
approximately the same as those incurred when the existing 
diffraction grating method is used. Reasons for this are as 
follows: 
  (1) doubling of the average output improved stepper's 
processing capability; 
  (2) laser cost can be held at the same level as that of the 
diffraction grating laser; 
  (3) the life-span of laser is about equal to that of the 
diffracting grating laser. 
  Since narrow bandwidth zone makes it possible to reduce the 
degradation of contrast caused by chromatic aberration, lens 
design can be simplified. Thus a decrease in lens material cost 
is creating expectations among LSI makers who look forward to 
have ``the KrF steppers with high NA without paying higher 
prices.''

<H5>  Reducing Etalon Degradation </H5>
  In order to realize the performance of KrF excimer laser, 
Toshiba designed a resonator with a new structure and evaluated 
it using a prototype device. Unlike existing resonators which 
introduced total output light into etalon, Toshiba's new 
resonator is structured to take in partial light through prisms 
and into the etalon. By minimizing degradation of etalon with 
this structure, the company was able to achieve a narrower 
bandwidth region, longer life, and higher output. 
  The following two factors account for Toshiba's ability to 
reduce etalon degradation: 
  (1) the light which enters etalon comprises 20% of 
the total 
light output; 
  (2) the area of light which came through prisms was spread 
by 
three-fold on the etalon, which made it possible to lengthen the 
life of lasers by more than tenfold as compared with the case in 
which existing etalon method was employed. 
  The reason why Toshiba was able to realize the narrowed band 
region was that the etalon consists of two layers. Because of 
the minimum degree of degradation, it was possible to have this 
layered structure. 
  It was possible for Toshiba to increase output to the 
maximum 
level simply because it was not necessary to suppress etalon 
degradation, whereas in the past, the company did not have such 
freedom, and this fact affected the level of output.

<H5>  Special Report </H5>
<H3>  Key To Realize 80% Production Level Is To Decrease 
Idling 
Time By Employing Multiphase </H3>
  First of all Mr. Tajima of Hitachi Manufacturing Company 
talked about the topic of ``what has to be done now,'' in order 
to reach the goal of &yen;50 thousand level by 1995, which 
includes the need for: 
  (1) Technical Reform; 
  (2) Cooperation of LCD/equipment makers to expand the 
market. 
  Next, Mr. Matsuno of Compaq Computer gave a lecture about 
Notebook PCs and TFT-LCDs from the user's point of view. In 
order to accelerate sale of the color Notebook PC that is 
expected to show sharp growth, there remain major issues to 
resolve including: reduced cost for color LCDs, improvement of 
screen image, complete software, and lower power consumption. 
Also, the size of the next generation standard LCD will be 
determined by: cost efficiency, technical constraints (LCD 
makers), price, maximum dimensions, stable supply (PC makers), 
price, and the demand for large screens (PC users). 
  Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba gave a lecture focusing on the 
manufacturing line structure and relooking at the cost of parts 
and materials for the second term. According to a study done by 
Toshiba, it was verified that there is the ``possibility of 
faster production than first term'' by looking at the 
specification of four multiphases, and tripled production 
investment based on glass baseboards of 360 x 465, multi-sheet 
equipment, and automation. If the number of production lines 
equipped for different generation production necessary to meet 
the demand for TFT-LCD is set as one (4 lines) for the first 
term, then it is viewed that the second term will be three times 
(12 lines) and third term will be over five times. 
  Mr. Morimoto at NEC gave a lecture about second term line 
structure. For the first term, although emphasis was placed on 
the verification of creation and mass production for the TFT 
market, there are some reconsiderations left before pursuing 
sharply increased mass production. For this reason, he mentioned 
the need for: 3-4 times higher manufacturing lines than in the 
first term, secured and improved quantity from manufacturing, 
realization of reasonable price, and establishment of a TFT-LCD 
manufacturing base. 
  Mr. Nakada of Sharp gave a lecture about the status and 
issues regarding equipment for a second line. The scenario of 
&yen;50 thousand by 1995 involves, ``twice the productivity, and 
80% performance level reducing idling time, and the 
reduction 
of material cost by half.'' That is to say, the keys for the 
second term are: 
  (1) improved production by multiphase; 
  (2) improvement for idling time by employing shorter 
processing and dust control; 
  (3) batch vs. piece, improvement and selection of inline 
method vs multichamber method; 
  (4) improvement for high speed and high quality film 
throughput. 
<H5>  Concrete Solutions Suggested by Each Material Maker </H5>
  In the afternoon the panel discussion adopted the debate 
format, and the status of each material and approach to the low 
cost regarding color filter, LCD driver, glass baseboard, and 
blacklight were discussed. In the discussion, at the request of 
LCD makers, each material maker talked about their projections 
from now on. 
<H5>  1. Color Filter (CF) </H5>
  Chairman, Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba opened the session, and 
indicated that CF takes 30% in logic material cost, which 
is 
disadvantageous for lowering the cost of LCDs. It is necessary 
to study improvement of idling time and investment production, 
and the possibility of new methods. In response to this, Mr. 
Nakano of Toppan Printing indicated, ``in actual cost of CF, the 
ratio between black matrix (BM) and glass baseboard is quite 
large. By improvement of performance in low reflection, 
improvement of through-put, interface with large model, and 
atomization of the inspection process, a cost reduction of 
40% 
is our aim.'' Mr. Tsuda of Dainippon Ink said that reduction of 
processes such as elimination of BM, and improvement of 
performance are under study. Dainippon Ink is currently 
constructing a new plant scheduled to begin operation in 1994, 
and the company will employ a four phase interface which will 
increase the performance by 3 to 4 times. Mr. Yasukawa of Shinto 
Painting specializing in STN talked about the company's plan to 
increase production in 1994, and in the beginning of 1995, at 
that time STN will complete its phase, the company intends to 
plan mass production of TFT-LCD by electrodeposition. LCD makers 
welcomed the newcomer. Each CF maker indicated a 60-80% 
price 
reduction by 1995. Also standardization for glass baseboard was 
requested. 
<H5>  2. LCD Driver </H5>
  Chairman Mr. Kato of NEC pointed out that LSI cost structure 
ratio in TFT-LCD used for the PB98 Notebook is 30%, and 
the 
cost is high next to CF which is about 40%. Also, doubt 
about 
the possibility of high performance and low cost were evident. 
Mr. Sano of Sharp representing the driver cited: 
  (1) low LCD operation voltage (15V 5V); 
  (2) digital LCD operation; 
  (3) minute wafer processes; 
  (4) minute pitch; 
  (5) multiple outputs. 
  Furthermore slim TCP packaging was also cited. Responses 
from 
Mr. Aoki of NEC, Mr. Takagi of Toshiba, and Mr. Takuma from 
Japan Texas Instruments were almost the same. Reduction of chip 
size will continue and discussion about packaging still left 
some issues to resolve. 
<H5>  3. Glass Baseboard </H5>
  Mr. Iwai of Corning Japan which has quite a large market 
share cited: 
  (1) improvement of solvent, molding, processing, and 
inspection techniques; 
  (2) large original board size; 
  (3) thin board; 
  (4) eliminating grinding; 
  (5)eliminating annealing. 
  Mr. Iwai indicated that it is possible to realize a 
50-60% 
cost reduction by adopting the above. Mr. Makino of NH Techno 
Glass, a newcomer, indicated that an annual 10% reduction 
by 
eliminating the complete grinding process; and Mr. Hara of Asahi 
Glass Fine Techno indicated 20% cost reduction by 1995 by 
eliminating annealing and using a thin baseboard. As a request 
to LCD makers, not only standardization of baseboard size, but 
standardization of other specifications were cited. Also other 
opinions were expressed, indicating that especially the method 
of inspection must be intensified from now on, and 
standardization is urgently needed. 
<H5>  4. Back Light (BL) </H5>
  Although BL is most active in the four material groups, to 
fulfill 1/3 of the goal and 1/2 of the cost cut are quite 
difficult. Already types are limited to short axial single light 
types for black and white, and long axial single light for 
color. Mr. Kojima of Chaya Industry indicated that ``power 
consumption is reduced from 5W to 2.4 W.'' Also ``a complete 
automated inspection process will be realized by 1995,'' said 
Mr. Kojima. The other solutions he cited included the 
development of material technology for standardization, 
automation line (Toshiba), review of production system, 
improvement and efficiency of mass production of optical 
conductor baseboard and invertor circuitry, review of each 
material for BL and improvement and effect of total material 
technology. 
<H5>  Danger Of Seeking Only Low Cost </H5>
  As a closing statement, Mr. Horikiri of NEC gave a lecture. 
``TFT-LCD especially still has a problem of stable production 
largely due to idling. Still the product has not yet reached the 
mass production level. But stable supply by second term 
production structure is important,'' mentioned Mr. Horikiri. 
Also he said that material cost ``has been cut in half in the 
past two years. To lower the cost, it is necessary to approach 
the cost aspect at a design stage.'' 
  This time, concrete solutions for low cost were suggested by 
each maker. Issues to solve such as the specification and 
standardization of glass baseboard and other materials were left 
to LCD makers. Response to these issues will be the key to 
explore &yen;50 thousand by 1995. 
  At last, Mr. Kanetani of Sharp pointed out, ``most of all 
marketability and a commercial base are important, and unless 
the configuration for a commercial product in 1995 is 
understood, the debate this time will have been nothing but 
nonsense.''

<H5>  New Business Strategy Is Explored With 9.5 Model STN Color </H5>
  Kyocera's renewed business strategy includes market 
penetration with a new 9.5 model STN color, and the start of 
color filter sales. For STN color market penetration, the 
company will attack TFT-LCD with an eye toward the personal 
computer market. Employing COG packaging that is Kyocera's 
forte, high precision products will be challenged. In March of 
next year, it is said that they will mass produce 15 thousand 
units per month. On the other hand, since the sales of color 
filters will start, production planning at the Kawauchi plant, 
which is one of five main five plants that the company operates, 
will be restructured. 
<H5>  Over 1993's Sales Amount &yen;5 Billion Projected </H5>
  --What is the behind the scenes story of Kyocera's entry 
into the LCD business, referring to the strategic location of 
Hayato plant, and its overview? 
  Research on LCD started in 1981, and its production started 
in 1986. The product was realized by integrating the thin film 
technology that we are good at, and COG packaging technology 
employing a thermal head. By employing COG packaging technology, 
a thin film model was realized from the beginning of sales. 
  The Hayato plant (Kagoshima Prefecture) which is the base 
for 
production has been operated since June, 1981. As seen from the 
date, the plant was not build for LCD production. The place was 
functionally a mother plant for various kinds of thin film 
electronic parts. As we still maintain the same business 
philosophy now, LCD is recognized not as a special device at our 
company but as one our thin film parts. 
  At present the production site is divided in two wings, one 
for LCD and the other for thermal head production. In the LCD 
production environment, a clean room related to lithography is 
operated at a class less than 300, and rest is at a class of 
1000. 
  --What are the products and their capacity at the Hayato 
plant? 
  The production capacity for the 9.5 model is 30 thousand per 
month. The main product is a 9.5 model STN monochrome for 
personal computers. This is 50% of our entire production. 
Forty 
percent is model 5 for FA and electronic notebooks, and 
10% is 
9.5 - 10.4 model STN color for OHP. One hundred percent of the 
products are sold. 
  --How about Kawauchi plant that manufactures color filters ? 
  The Kawauchi plant (Kagoshima prefecture) is three stories 
high and was constructed in 1990. The first and third floors 
were used for other businesses, and color filter production 
takes place on the second floor. A clean room is operated with 
same base as that of Hayato plant. At present, the line only 
occupies 1/8 of the entire floor. This lineUs capacity is 10 
thousand a month but in reality production is 4 thousand a 
month. If lines are installed on the entire floor, 200 thousand 
a month will be produced. 
  --Color filter production method and production idling? 
  A pigment dispersion method is employed. Due to idling, the 
production level is 80% but we will raise that to 
95% level in 
two to three months. 
  --Base place for R &amp; D? 
  A new wing was constructed at the site of the Hayato plant 
in 
December of 1991. R&amp;D is conducted in this new wing including 
the research for thin films such as LCD. Development of 
commercial products, material technology, and process 
development are all conducted here. 
  --Ratio for export? 
  Fifty percent of the products sold are exported, and 
80% of 
our exports are for the US, 20% are for Europe. We intend 
to 
maintain the sales ratio for domestic and overseas market at 
50-50. At this point we are not considering overseasUs 
production. Even in the future if we decide to open plants 
overseas, the plants will probably be for assembly only. Also I 
think the production of color filters will not go overseas. 
<H5>  New Business Explored </H5>
  --New Business Strategy for LCD Business? 
  Since September of 1993, 9.5 model STN color production for 
personal computers has started. As you know, supply for 
monochrome is 2 to 3 times greater than the demand. That is to 
say there is an excess of supply. On the other hand, TFT for 
color can not catch up with the demand. For this reason, the 
market is shifting from TFT to STN color. 
  At a concrete level, production at a rate of 150 thousand 
per 
month is planned by March of 1994, and production ratio for 
color and monochrome will be 50:50. After March, color 
production will be increased, and eventually the ratio will be 
90:10. 
  Also, a dot pitch 0.25 with high precision will be 
commercialized by the beginning of next year (1994), we will be 
ready for market penetration. Application is for subnotebook 
personal computers. 
  --What is the technical point that will realize the 0.25 
dot pitch? 
  That is the COG packaging. Certainly in monochrome type, 
other companies' products are getting thin, and the merit of COG 
is diminishing. However, for color, COG packaging is still 
surviving. With STN color, to package 0.25mm products with TAB 
is difficult. In the TAB technique, 70m is the limit for 
pitch, but our COG technology can interface up to 60m pitch. 
Moreover the color filter is also manufactured at our company, 
the disadvantage of meeting delivery day seen in TFT is not a 
problem. 
  --So we hear that the color filter be sold also. 
  The sales will start in November this year. A concrete plan 
has not yet been finalized, but at present, samples have been 
shipped to three makers for evaluation. From now on, looking at 
the status of ordering and shipping of STN color, production 
plans at Kawauchi plant will be formulated. 
  --How about business exploration from now on? 
  Our first goal is to raise the STN color ratio. The 
monochrome type is not going to diminish in the market at all, 
minute high precision products will become important. After 
that, products with a digitizer on board for use with a pen 
input and OHP will also become important. These four products 
will be the pillar for our business. 
  --How about the budget for new business plan? 
  We project 1994 sales of &yen;10 trillion. 
<H5>  Keyword Is Color </H5>
  -- What about the plan for TFT-LCD Commercial Products? 
  At this point when and how to get into the market is not 
clear. It is still at the stage of R&amp;D. 
  --How are you going to purchase the driver ICs? 
  From several semiconductor makers, we buy bare chips stored 
in a tray. 
  --From bare chips, are you going to package? Don't you face 
any environmental test? 
  We have technology and data that were accumulated for 12 
years that built the thermal head. Reliability is no problem at 
all. Structure of technology is quite well founded. For example, 
liquid crystal panel guaranteed value is 60 C at maximum, 
and even polarizing plate is 60-70 C. These guaranteed 
values are quite less than our thermal head requires. 
  At present, after the chips are packaged, they will be 
subjected to environment tests, and repair will be done. And for 
new products, 100% inspection is performed. After the 
manufacturing process is established, then random sampling will 
be employed. 
  --How do you reduce costs other than through the production 
of your own color filter. 
  Reduce the number of process, and throughput will be 
increased. On that foundation, by the efficiency of mass 
production, cost reductions will be planned. 
  --Are you referring to a single unit commercial product for 
efficiency of mass production? 
  That is right. Our business strategy aims at the 9.5 model 
STN color from now on. 
  --How about lines for processing? 
  Still the same one that is seven years old. The dual phase 
processing line using 300 x 360 baseboard. 
  --Are you going to invest in new equipment? 
  No. The present line is good enough. If we build a new 
plant, 
then that will be a four-phase line. But we don't feel the need 
at this point. Will there be any merit for investing in new 
equipment for STN? To recoup from investment, if the plus is 
going up, then new investment doesn't make sense. For that 
reason, our LCD business is a part of the thin film electronic 
products department. We have so many other things to do. before 
getting into new equipment investment under a cloudy climate. 
  --How about mid-long planning? 
  That will be also after March of next year (1994) when the 
ratio of color and monochrome reaches 50:50. The keyword is 
color, and the trend of color will determine our business plans 
from now on.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  For minute MOS devices, oxide gate film damage caused during 
the processes of dry etching and ion implantation is 
problematic. In the ion implantation process, charge-up damage 
caused by the ionsU electric charge, and the impact of energy 
granules are major problems. Especially in the doping process by 
which source and drain are implanted simultaneously, it is 
necessary to pay attention so as not to cause damage. 
  Generally, as a way to prevent damage caused by charge-up at 
the time of ion implantation, a method is employed by which 
electrons are supplied and the positive ion beam is neutralized. 
However, sometimes because of the supply of electrons, a reverse 
negative charge is built up and the damage to the oxide film 
becomes even greater. 
  In this text, the problem of oxide film damage is discussed 
based on the results of measurements obtained from oxide film 
pressure tolerance, and the reduction of negative charge-up 
using magnetic and electrical fields. Also quantitative 
evaluation of oxide film damage at the time of ion implantation 
using the method of QBD (charge to breakdown) by 
TDDB (time dependent dielectric breakdown) is discussed. 
<H5>  Method of Experiment </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-36A>           Figure 1. Antenna Capacitor Cross Section </FIG>




  The device used for ion implantation in this experiment is a 
batch type large electrical current ion implantation model, 
equipped with a flood gun which neutralizes the electric charge 
of the ion beam. This flood gun employs a method in which low 
energy secondary electrons from Ar atoms derived from heated 
electrons (first generation electrons) are pulled out from a 
filament and then exposed to Ar gas. The quantity of secondary 
energy is controlled by the emission current (filament bias). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-36B> Figure 2. Ratio Of Good Quality Yields By Pressure Tolerance </FIG>



  In the experiment to evaluate deterioration of pressure 
tolerance in the oxide film caused by charge-up, a 15nm thick 
oxide gate film with an area of 20x20 m[.sup]2[/] was 
formed. Using an antenna capacitor (figure 1) formed by poly-Si 
electrodes with a 200 nm thick film as a test device, and an 
80keV beam current at 22mA, 5 x 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] 
As ions were implanted. The experiment was evaluated by studying 
the dependency of antenna ratio (ratio of area in electrodes and 
oxide film) on the rate of production of an oxide film with good 
pressure tolerance (&gt; 8MV/cm). 
  In the experiment to measure Q[.sup]BD[/] due to constant 
current TDDB, the same test device used in the evaluation of 
pressure tolerance was employed, and the sample to which ions 
were implanted by changing the energy and dose, and to which 
constant current stress (10mA/cm[.sup]2[/]) was applied, was 
measured. The amount of electric charge damage Q[.sup]BDO[/] 
(initial characteristic of oxide film) measured with the test 
material without ion Implantation was 47 C/cm[.sup]2[/]. 
<H5>  Damage Of Oxide Film Pressure Tolerance Caused By Charge-Up </H5>
  First of all, damage of oxide film pressure tolerance in the 
case of ion implantation without neutralized electrons is 
discussed here. When ions are implanted without operating a 
flood gun, the rate of producing material with good pressure 
tolerance tends to be low because of the high antenna ratio 
(figure 2 (a).) This is because, if the antenna ratio is higher, 
that is to say, as the area of the electrodes exposed to the ion 
beam increases, the amount of electric charge the electrodes 
receive also increases, and a large electric charge is implanted 
in the oxide film. 
  Therefore, damage of oxide film at the time of ion 
implantation depends on the electric charge to which the 
electrodes are exposed. This damage can effectively be prevented 
by neutralizing the ion beamUs positive electrical charge by 
electron exposure. For this reason, figure 2 (b) shows antenna 
ratio dependency with good pressure tolerance when ion 
implantation occurs with flood gun operation. In this case, when 
flood gun was operated, compared to ion beam exposure only, the 
rate of acceptable production declined. This is thought to be 
because electrons from the flood gun reversely cause a negative 
charge-up . Thus an experiment to verify the occurrence of this 
negative charge was conducted. 
  Under the same condition of flood gun exposure but in the 
absence of an ion beam as shown in figure 2 (b), there is an 
antenna ratio dependency to the good production rate for 
pressure tolerance, when only electrons are exposed, as shown in 
figure 2 (c). In this case, even with higher antenna ratios, it 
is observed that good production ratio for pressure tolerance is 
not reduced. By calculating the amount of electric charge 
electrodes receive from electrons as a result of the waferUs 
exposure to the electron beam, and the maximum antenna ratio, 
the amount of electric charge Q[.sup]BDC[/] 
(47C/cm[.sup]2[/]) was found not to be large enough to cause 
static damage to the oxide film. From this finding, the cause of 
negative charge-up in the case of the flood gun is thought to be 
caused by the interaction of electrons with the ion beam when 
both are present simultaneously. Therefore the following 
experiment was conducted. 
  Generally ions are implanted inside the wafer uniformly by 
wafer foil spin and scan at the time of implantation. If ions 
are implanted without scanning, then different stress can occur 
inside the wafer as shown in figure 3. Figure 4 shows the 
distribution of the oxide film pressure tolerance in the wafer. 
From this figure, it is clear that the loss of pressure 
tolerance is found initially in the peripheral area of the ion 
beam exposure region. This shows that electrons are accumulated 
at the peripheral area of the ion beam. And it is considered 
that this high density of electrons causes negative charge-up. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-37A>           Figure 3. Conceptual Diagram Of Ion Implantation Without </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-37B>           Figure 4. Distribution Of Pressure Tolerance When Ions Are </FIG>




<H5>  Control of Electron By Magnetic Field </H5>
  Although negative charge-up occurs as electrons reach the 
wafer, when charge-up advances to some level, electrons having 
low energy can not reach the wafer, and charge-up will not 
advance. Therefore even if there is a high density of low energy 
electrons, the charge-up at that point may not contribute to 
oxide film damage. That is to say, in the prevention of negative 
charge-up, the supply of low energy electrons to the wafer is 
important. 
  In the ion implantation device used this time, an upward 
direction of magnetic field was observed near the wafer. In this 
case, as seen in figure 5 (a), first generation electrons 
released from flood gun, can reach the wafer. Thus, as shown in 
figure 5 (b), an experiment was conducted in which the direction 
of the magnetic field was changed to the opposite direction, and 
the orbit of first generation electrons was reversed, that is 
opposite of the wafer direction. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-38A> Figure 5. Conceptual Diagram Electron Orbit To The </FIG>



  Figure 6 shows the result of an experiment in which the 
direction of the magnetic field was reversed. In this 
experiment, the condition was established so that the density of 
electrons reaching the wafer became evenly dispersed, 
independent of the direction of the magnetic field. When the 
magnetic field is in an upward direction, as the antenna ratio 
increases, the production rate of material with good pressure 
tolerance decreases, however with a downward magnetic field, it 
was found that as the antenna ratio increases the rate of good 
material production is maintained. This is thought to be because 
the direction of electron orbits with higher energy are bent in 
a reverse direction by the magnetic field, and as a result the 
distribution of electron energy that reaches wafer is changed 
(figure 7). In the case of an upward directed magnetic field, 
the maximum energy level of electrons reaching the wafer is the 
same as the filament bias (electron heat pulled out by the 
applied voltage), and it is thought that first generation 
electrons are reaching the wafer. On the other hand, it was 
found that in the case of a downward directed magnetic field, 
even though filament bias is high, only low energy second 
generation electrons reach the wafer, and high energy first 
generation electrons are fully eliminated. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-38B>           Figure 6. Distribution Of Pressure Tolerance Good </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-39A>           Figure 7. Distribution Of Pressure Tolerance Good Product </FIG>




  By doing this, it was found that controlling high energy 
electron orbits by using an electrical field effectively 
prevented damage to oxide film pressure tolerance caused by 
negative charge. 
<H5>  Control Of Electrons By Electrical Field </H5>
  In this section, we discuss the result of experiments in 
which the electron energy reaching the wafer is effectively 
changed by applying a DC bias to the wafer, in addition to the 
effect of the magnetic field. In the experiments, -10V and +10V 
bias voltages are applied to the wafer while the magnetic field 
was directed downward. 
  Figure 7 (a) shows the antenna dependency of good product 
rate of oxide film pressure tolerance when bias is applied to 
wafer. The electron energy at this point is shifted as much as 
the amount of the bias current (figure 7 (b). When a positive 
bias is applied, maximum electron energy is controlled at a low 
level, even though the higher antenna ratio will maintain a good 
product rate. 
  Thus, for prevention of charge at the time of large current 
ion implantation, it is important to supply low energy 
electrons. By using magnetic and electrical fields, the test 
verified that the method to control the electron energy using 
magnetic and electrical field is valid. Also the experiment this 
time found that the oxide film pressure tolerance will not 
deteriorate when the distribution of electron energy supplied is 
less than 40-50 eV. 
<H5>  Evaluation Of Oxide Film Damage By Q </H5>
[.sup]BD[/] Method 
  In the following, evaluation of oxide film damage due to ion 
implantation employing the method of Q[.sup]BD[/] with 
constant quantities is discussed. In this experiment, after ions 
are injected under each antenna capacitor in conditions having 
various antenna ratios (As+: 30-80keV, 5x10[.sup]14[/] - 2 x 
10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]), electric charge 
Q[.sup]BD[/] causing damage by applying constant current 
stress (10mA/cm[.sup]2[/]) was measured. Figure 8 (a) and (b) 
are the measurements plotted for Q[.sup]BD[/] against the 
stress of electric charge Q[.sup]ST[/] (amount of electric 
charge that antenna receives) by ion implantation. Figure 8 (a) 
shows that Q[.sup]ST[/] changes with dose, and figure 8 (b) 
shows Q[.sup]ST[/] also changes with the antenna ratio. The 
value of Q[.sup]BD[/] when Q[.sub]ST[/] = 0 shows 
Q[.sup]BD0[/] (47C/cm[.sup]2[/]), and the other plot shows 
the value of Q[.sup]BD[/] after each stress is applied. 
Namely, it shows how oxide film is damaged by ion implantation 
stress. The broken line is the line shown by the equation of 
Q[.sup]BD[/] = Q[.sub]BD0[/] -Q[.sub]ST[/], and like 
the constant current TDDB, it shows damage to the extent that 
the electric charge that flows in the oxide film reduces 
Q[.sup]BD[/]. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-40A>           Figure 8. Relation Between Q[.sup]BD[/] And Ion </FIG>




  When ion implantation energy is low (30keV), dependency of 
dose Q[.sup]BD[/], and antenna ratio dependency are almost on 
the same direct line, and the characteristic is similar to that 
of the broken line. This demonstrates that the damage of oxide 
film is proportional to ion implantation stress and it 
progresses along with constant current TDDB. On the other hand, 
the figure shows that when ion implantation energy is high 
(&gt; 50keV), Q[.sup]BD[/] dose dependency and antenna ratio 
dependency tend to be different. The antenna ratio dependency 
shows the characteristic of flatness which indicates that oxide 
film damage is not dependent on the amount of electric charge. 
From this and reduction of Q[.sup]BD[/] by increase of dose, 
it can be said that the increased amount of ion exposure rather 
than the electrical charge contributes to the damage. Also, even 
in implanted ion profile which is in range of energy collected 
in the shallow region in poly-Si, it should be noted that damage 
to the oxide film is considered to be caused by ion exposure. 
  Therefore, for damage of oxide film due to ion implantation, 
three modes of damages can be cited: Damage that depends on the 
amount of implantation of electric charge which is significant 
in the low energy region; damage that depends on the amount of 
ion exposure which is significant in the higher energy region; 
and damage in the early stage that depends on the implantation 
energy. In the case of the damage caused by the amount of 
electric charge implanted, it is possible to reduce this by 
supplying neutral electrons, but since the damage by ion 
exposure will have bad a effect on the reliability of the oxide 
film, it is necessary to be cautious. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  At the time of large current ion implantation, damage to the 
pressure tolerance of oxide film caused by charge up was 
studied. It was found that negative charge-up, in the case when 
neutral electrons are employed, is generated when excess high 
energy electrons exist, and when these electrons collect around 
the high density ion beam to which the material is exposed. And, 
as a way of preventing this negative charge-up, it was found 
through the results of our experiments in which a magnetic field 
was applied near the wafer or a DC bias was applied to the 
wafer, so that the distribution of electron energies reaching 
the wafer was controlled, and only the high energy electrons 
were eliminated, that the negative charge-up was effectively 
reduced. As a benchmark indicator for lowering the energy, we 
found that when the electron energy reaching the wafer is 
controlled to less than 40eV, damage of pressure tolerance in 
the oxide film was not seen even with capacitors having high 
antenna ratios. 
  From the evaluation found using the Q[.sup]BD[/] method to 
assess the damage of oxide film due to ion implantation, it was 
determined that there are two causes: One mode is derived from 
the amount of implantation of electrical charge and is seen when 
the implanted energy is quite low, and another mode is derived 
from ion exposure and is seen when the implanted energy is 
relatively high. It was found that in the former case, the 
relation of the amount of implantation of electric charge and 
Q[.sup]BD[/] is almost the same as the constant current TDDB, 
and in the latter case, the amount of damage becomes greater as 
the injected energy becomes higher. 
  From the discussion above, for the prevention oxide film 
damage during the process of ion implantation to gate 
electrodes, it is important to pay attention to the relation 
between the film density at gate electrodes and the energy 
implanted, so that ion exposure damage can be prevented, and 
furthermore, charge-up damage can be prevented by supplying low 
energy electrons. 
  For their help in conducting this research we thank our 
associates at Applied Materials Japan, Incorporated.

  [Text] On 7 December JAERI disclosed the manufacturing 
status of the intermediate heat exchanger to be installed on the 
high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR), which is a 
high temperature gas reactor research facility that JAERI is 
building at its O-arai Laboratory in Ibaraki Prefecture. At 
present the heat exchanger is about 55% completed and is 
scheduled to be transported to the construction site in 
September 1994. 
  The HTTR heat exchanger is being built at Yokohama Plant No. 
1 (Yokohama City) of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. The 
device will transfer the heat from high temperature helium gas 
coming out of the reactor at 850-950C to a secondary helium 
gas system. The secondary helium gas will reach a temperature of 
900C and become a heat source for thermal systems other 
than those used for power generation. 
  These will be the highest temperatures in the world for a 
heat exchanger installed in a reactor to operate under. To 
assure durability under these high temperatures, the body of the 
heat exchanger has a two-layered structure, and the space 
between the inner and outer casings will be cooled by secondary 
helium gas flowing through pipes at about 400C. This design 
will help maintain the pressure-resistant outer casing at a 
lower temperature. 
  The high temperature gas reactor uses [omission] as fuel, 
graphite as the core structural material, and helium gas for 
cooling. It offers advantages because high temperature heat can 
be obtained for a variety of uses in addition to power 
generation. Construction began on the HTTR at the research 
facility in March 1991, and work is proceeding with a target of 
attaining initial criticality in 1998.

  [Text] On 8 December the Japan Atomic Power Company 
revealed that it is considering having the U.S. company 
Westinghouse participate in the detailed design and equipment 
manufacturing for its Tsuruga NPP III and NPP IV (output: 
1,420,000 kW each) planned for construction at Tsuruga City in 
Fukui Prefecture. Japan Atomic Power is taking positive action 
to ease U.S.-Japan trade friction in the electric power industry 
by importing gas turbines, etc., from the U.S. Participation by 
Westinghouse in this project, which has a projected total 
construction cost of one trillion yen, should alleviate some of 
the trade friction. 
  Tsuruga NPPs III and IV will use a modified PWR reactor with 
increased output and better safety devices. The reactor is based 
on the modified reactor developed jointly by five electric power 
companies including Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric 
Power, Japan Atomic Power, etc., and Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Westinghouse, and the national government. Because 
of its past involvement, Japan Atomic Power is considering 
asking Westinghouse to participate. However, Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries is scheduled to be the main contractor, and Yutaka 
Kurihara (executive director, Japan Atomic Power) says, 
``Westinghouse will not receive half the work load.'' 
  The U.S. company General Electric and Hitachi, Ltd., have 
each received one-third of the orders for the Kashiwazaki Kariwa 
NPPs VI and VII (output: 1,350,000 kW each) being build by Tokyo 
Electric Power. It appears that Japan Atomic Power has learned 
from this example in considering the participation of a U.S. 
company. 
  On site coordination has not been completed for Tsuruga NPPs 
III and IV, so the date construction will begin is still 
undecided. Because construction will take at least 4.5 years, 
these NPPs will begin operation after the turn of the century.

  [Text]According to a study of atomic energy related 
industries for 1992 compiled by the Japan Atomic Industrial 
Forum, atomic energy related sales in mining and manufacturing 
have reached the two trillion yen mark for the first time. Since 
first topping the one trillion yen mark in 1981, sales have 
doubled in just eleven years. Among expenditures in the electric 
power industry, the increase in repair costs was especially high 
because Kansai Electric Power began replacement of its steam 
generators. 
  The study covered 520 companies in atomic energy related 
industries and is based on the data they supplied. Atomic energy 
related sales in the mining industry totaled 
&yen;2,241,000,000,000, an increase of 22% over 1991. The 
increase in reactor equipment was 24% over 1991, and fuel 
cycle 
related sales also increased 11%, reflecting a rise in 
sales 
overall. 
  Among the 326 companies responding, 40 had sales greater 
than 
ten billion yen, and the top 50 companies occupied 83% of 
total 
sales. When we break down domestic power generation by BWRs and 
PWRs, each format has about the same number of operating power 
plants, but when we look at plants under construction and in the 
planning stages, BWRs outnumber PWRs five to one for an 
overwhelming advantage. 
  Atomic energy related expenditures by the electric power 
industry came to &yen;1,834,190,000,000 for an increase of 
0.5% 
over 1991. This breaks down to 41.2% for operating and 
maintenance costs, 39.1% for construction, 15% for 
fuel, 3.6% 
for setup costs and 1.1% for miscellaneous expenses. 
Operating 
and maintenance costs came to &yen;755,300,000,000, a new high.

  If we let the expenditures by the electric power industry 
for 
1992 equal 100, the expenditures for 1993-1997 are expected to 
range from 86 to 92. Construction costs of more than seven 
hundred billion yen in 1992 are expected to drop to the three 
hundred billion yen range by 1997. However, Electric Power 
Development Coordination Council plans call for eleven new NPPs 
in the next two years with an output of about 12,000,000 kW, and 
we can expect mid- and long-range construction costs to make a 
comeback.

  [Text][dateline: Fukui] 
  Kozo Iida, president of Japan Atomic Power Company, visited 
Fukui Prefecture on 9 December and asked for prefectural 
governor Yukio Kurita's cooperation on the construction of 
Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4. At a press conference after the 
meeting, when Mr. Iida was asked about the decommissioning of 
Tsuruga NPP No. 1, which is among the conditions for additional 
construction proposed by the mayor of Tsuruga City, he said, 
``We will consider decommissioning the plant after the year 
2000, when NPPs No. 3 and 4 are completed.'' 
  Japan Atomic Power already has a group for investigating 
reactor decommissioning in its Power Generation Division's Power 
Generation Administration Department. The company began setting 
aside funds for decommissioning in 1988. 
  However, the only example of decommissioning in Japan is the 
Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR) at JAERI's Tokai 
Research Institute (Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture), so Japan 
has less experience than the U.S. or European nations. There are 
questions to be answered such as whether another nuclear power 
plant can be built on the same site, how to dispose of the large 
amount of waste material, etc. In the future, the topic of 
decommissioning is likely to become the focus of problems 
concerning additional construction at Tsuruga. 
  When asked about plans to proceed with construction, Mr. 
Iida 
also said, ``We will ask for support in such areas as human 
resources from various power companies such as Hokuriku Electric 
Power Company that will be recipients of the power we 
generate.'' However, on the same day Hokuriku Electric Power 
Company vice president Masao Shimizu told reporters in Tokyo, 
``We do not know whether we will receive power from Tsuruga NPPs 
No. 3 and 4 because we still do not have a clear understanding 
of what the supply and demand situation for electric power will 
be. Right now it is a blank slate.'' Clearly the two companies 
are not in step. 
  Therefore, the role of Kansai Electric Power Company, which 
has insufficient power resources and whose sites for new power 
plants sit empty, holds the key Japan Atomic Power Company's 
support.

  [Text] Japan Atomic Power Company has launched construction 
plans for the world's largest nuclear power plant. The 
construction dates are still undecided, but this will be the 
world's first advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR). It was 
developed jointly by five electric power companies including 
Kansai Electric Power, Kyushu Electric Power and Japan Atomic 
Power, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the government, and the U.S. 
company Westinghouse based on the Standardization Program for 
Third Generation Advanced LWRs. 
  This plant will consist of Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4, which 
each will have an output of 1,420,000 kW. Previous PWR type LWRs 
have used a dual system emergency core cooling system (ECCS) but 
the APWR will have a quadruple system ECCS. Plans call for the 
reactor to used a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides (MOX) 
for fuel. At most, plutonium oxide will make up 33% of the 
fuel. However, Toru Ishii (Director, Nuclear Power Technology 
Administration Office, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) says, ``The 
APWR will have the capability to burn MOX with as much as 
50% 
plutonium oxide,'' because it was designed for core and 
operational diversity. 
  This plant will use a large core that can load 30% 
more 
uranium and yield 20% more output than Kansai Electric 
Power's 
Osaka NPP No. 4. Having this difference of more than 10% 
means 
the time until the next fuel replacement can be extended. It 
also has the advantage that the amount of heat produced by the 
individual fuels will be less, making things easier to control. 
  The reactor will have a stainless steel neutron reflector 
positioned around the fuel assembly. The neutrons that have been 
wasted because they do not collide with fuel will be reflected 
once more into the center to increase burnup of the nuclear fuel. 
  Yutaka Kurihara (Executive Director, Japan Atomic Power) 
says, ``Strictly speaking, the Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4 are not 
APRWs according to the Standardization Program for Third 
Generation LWRs'' because they do not include a spectral shift 
mechanism to increase burnup efficiency of the fuel. This 
mechanism has zirconium rods inserted in it, and later they are 
withdrawn and replaced with water. It is designed so that the 
increased water slows down the neutrons, and that enables 
efficient burnup of fuels that gradually become harder and 
harder to burn. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-43A>           Key: 1. Comparision of Core Construction; 2. Past PWR; 3. </FIG>




  Spectral shift increases burnup efficiency by 10%. 
However, 
because the fuel cost accounts for only 20% of the total 
cost 
of nuclear power generation, it only reduces the total costs by 
about 2%. Moreover, maintenance and inspection of the 
device 
that raises and lowers the zirconium rods are delicate and 
complex operations, so Japan Atomic Power decided not to use it. 
  A demand will arise about the year 2000 for refurbishing 
aging nuclear power plants in the U.S. At that time a new 
generation of reactors will be needed. The APWR and advanced 
boiling water reactors have become the prime candidates to fill 
that need.

<H3>  Pioneer Plans To Participate In European Digital Audio 
Broadcasting System </H3>
  Pioneer is the first non-European company to join the Eureka 
147 project, which has been promoting the standardization of DAB 
(Digital Audio Broadcasting) via digital transmission in Europe. 
The project that Pioneer is going to join decided to develop and 
use its own regulations as a world standard in the summer of 
1993. Because of this decision, Pioneer, a non-European company, 
was able to join the project. 
  The Eureka 147 project is promoting DAB via digital 
transmission which makes it possible to receive signals even by 
a mobile media. DAB will start in 1995. 
  Pioneer which was permitted to join the project as the first 
non-European company said, ``by being able to participate in 
this project, production of experimental devices for 
broadcasting will become possible.'' 
  Pioneer will provide DAB experimental receivers to DRRI 
(Digital Radio Research Inc.) in the beginning of 1995. The 
experimental broadcasting is planned to start in Canada in the 
beginning of 1994 using a transmitter developed in Europe. 
  The reason why the Eureka 147 project opened the door to 
non-European companies seems to be that the project aims at 
world standardization. In the past, it was said that the 
specifications regarding OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplex) for modulation ``had never been disclosed to 
technical people in Japan.'' This sudden change is perceived as 
a way to establish a world standard which will enable Japanese 
makers to manufacture the receivers. 
<H5>  Three Kinds Of Modes According To Frequency Bands </H5>
  Table 1 shows the DAB regulation that Europe is suggesting 
to 
ITU-RS (old: CCIR). OFDM used for modulation is digital 
transmission using intersecting multiple carrier waves. 
Depending on the carrier waves in frequency bands, three modes 
are set. Mode I is terrestrial broadcasting, mode II is 
terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, and mode III assumes use 
for satellite broadcasting. All three modes have 1.5 MHz 
frequency band width. 
  Most characteristic for OFDM is that it is not significantly 
influenced by multipath distortion caused by objects such as 
mountains and buildings. The development of a mobile receiver 
for audio and video is getting quite active. 
  Allowable hours of multipath change depending on the mode. 
Since terrestrial broadcasting will be most susceptible to 
multipath interference, mode I has the longest allowable hours. 
Depending on the allowable delay hours, the duration of the 
guard interval (during the period of 1 symbol, the period at the 
time of demodulation is ignored) which avoids interference 
between symbols also varies.

<F P=106> Yamaguchi's Attractions as an Industrial Prefecture </F>
  [Text] Yamaguchi, The Healthy Prefecture 
  I think it would be safe to say that Yamaguchi prefecture 
reflects Japan in miniature. That is, Yamaguchi is a compact 
combination of all the elements found throughout Japan. It has 
mountains, forests, and seas, including the Japan Sea and the 
Inland Sea. It has both beach and ski resorts. It has farms as 
well as fishing villages and fishery combines. It possesses 
various industries in all fields, ranging from textiles, iron 
and steel, chemicals, and petroleum, to electrical machinery, 
machines, automobiles, and semiconductors. 
  The scale of the prefecture is also about medium among all 
the prefectures and metropolitan areas, with a population of 
1,560,000, ranking 25th in the nation. The total production in 
the prefecture is &yen;4,467 billion, ranking 23rd in the nation. 
  The living environment of Yamaguchi Prefecture is especially 
outstanding. It is a world far distant from the urban commuter 
hell, and daily life is filled with a beauty of nature that 
cannot be experienced in the big cities. For example, it takes 
only three minutes to walk from my house to the river where 
fireflies abound, and whichever town or city you visit in the 
prefecture, the amount of green that one sees is completely 
different than in Tokyo or Osaka. The roads in the prefecture 
are in excellent condition,and traffic congestion is rare, so it 
takes about one hour to travel from the capital, Yamaguchi city, 
to any location in the prefecture, and everywhere one can easily 
get in touch with nature. 
  As everyone knows, the Meiji Restoration, which constituted 
the beginning of modern Japan had its origins in Yamaguchi. Even 
now, the remains of the warriors of the Choshu clan are found in 
many locations throughout the prefecture, beginning with Hagi, 
and one can sense in daily conversations that the sense of pride 
of the Choshu warrior resides in the consciousness of the 
prefecture's citizens. 
  Thus one has the opportunity to come in frequent contact 
with 
good points of Japan and her people that cannot be sensed in 
Tokyo. 
  In every Japanese industry from now on, no matter in which 
field, display of creativity will be of major importance, and 
the source of this creativity is people. Such people will first 
be able to display their creativity if they are placed in a 
living environment such as that of Yamaguchi, which abounds in 
``prosperity and riches.'' 
  Yamaguchi, The Industrial Prefecture. 
  Yamaguchi has followed the typical pattern of growth of 
industry in modern Japan up to the present time. During the 
policy of industrial growth of the Meiji Period, the first 
cement plants were constructed. Before the war, there was a navy 
depot, and the prefecture was a base for supplying the military 
in shipbuilding, coal, and fuel oil production. After the war, 
the prefecture, being on the western end of Honshu in the 
Pacific Belt Zone, contributed greatly to the economic growth of 
our country, forming a large coastal complex centered in the 
Shunan area, and served as a major base for our country's 
chemical and heavy industries. 
  In 1964, the Shunan Region was designated as a special zone 
for establishing industry, and Yamaguchi Prefecture, along with 
the Ube and Onoda regions, where cement manufacturing and 
chemical industries have flourished, and Shimonoseki, where 
shipbuilding has predominated, have taken the lead in the growth 
pattern for Japan's economy, and has firmly established the 
image of an industrial prefecture. During the first and second 
oil shocks, it was severely impacted, and much time was needed 
for recovery. In recent years, in order to raise the level of 
industrial structure, it has made great efforts to attract 
processing and assembly industries and the most modern of plants 
are now in operation producing semiconductors, automobiles, and 
the like. 
  However, as before, it still relies greatly on chemical and 
heavy industries such as chemicals, steel and oil, and has 
tended to lag behind in transforming its industrial structure. 
The weight of industrial shipments in the country has dropped 
from two percent at the time of the second oil shock to 
currently about 1.5 percent. Consequently, it is very desirable 
for Yamaguchi to regain its authority as an industrial 
prefecture by raising further the level of its industrial 
infrastructure. 
  Towards Establishing Yamaguchi as a Technology Prefecture 
  In our view, the key to restoring authority to Yamaguchi as 
an industrial center lies in technology. Since receiving 
acceptance of the plan for a technopolis in Ube in 1984, an 
all-out effort has been under way to develop high-level 
technology and industry based on this plan and at present, on 
the basis of the second phase of the development plan approved 
for 1992, we are establishing Ube New City as a core strategic 
base. Even the Fourth Long Range Prospectus for Development of 
the Prefecture, compiled in 1988, called for plans for a 
high-technology belt, and assigned first priority to making 
technology the nucleus of development of the prefecture. Of 
special note as one implementation of the development plans for 
the prefecture, we must cite the establishment of the Japan 
Ultra-High Temperature Materials Research Institute (JUTEMI) and 
Japan Ultra-High Temperature Materials Center (JUTEM). 
  The center and the institute received funding for a 
Mechanism 
for Development of New Energy and Industrial Technology based on 
the Improvement of R&amp;D Infrastructure Law and began 
operation in 
April 1992 receiving funding also from regional public 
corporations in Yamaguchi and Gifu prefectures and from private 
corporations. They have attracted a world authority in this 
field, professor emeritus Ryohei Tanaka of the Tokyo Institute 
of Technology. They offer outstanding, world-class test 
environments for studying new materials under ultra high 
temperatures. 
  Our mission is to have it grow as a focal point for 
research, 
emanating from Yamaguchi, extending out to the world at large. 
While we have made substantial progress in developing the 
center, general awareness of it is low, so we are concentrating 
on seeing just how to publicize it and plan for increasing its 
utilization. In order to establish and cultivate sophisticated 
urban service industries that will contribute to development of 
a high-level industrial infrastructure, we were authorized to 
develop a ``brain center'' concept in June 1992, and we are 
currently engaged in implementing the plan. Also, in order to 
place a major emphasis on cultivating local human resources in 
software, we are constructing an optoelectronics software park, 
pursuant to the regional software law 
  This is the tenth year since Yamaguchi was designated by the 
Technopolis Law. 
  In March of this year, we formulated a basic plan for 
technology development for the prefecture, with a view towards 
the year 2000 (the Intertech Yamaguchi Plan), based on the 
realization that technology-centered industrial development will 
reach its second stage, which will be a large step forward. 
  According to this scheme, we will establish a concrete base 
for developing technology in the hardware area, and a creative 
core technology for the prefecture in the software area. We are 
thus aiming at raising the level of technology in Yamaguchi 
prefecture as a whole, by promoting technology exchange that 
focuses on the industry-wide dimension, using this as leverage 
to establish a high-level industrial infrastructure. We also 
wish to create long-term employment opportunities, emphasizing 
our young people in particular. 
  We are just now beginning to evaluate, on the basis of this 
conception, how we should basically provide for and complete the 
existing industrial technology centers in the prefecture in 
order to create a core technology base for the prefecture. 
  At the same time, we are making great efforts to promote the 
science and engineering that form the foundations for industrial 
technology. The Yamaguchi Prefecture Council for the Promotion 
of Science and Technology, whose members include Dr. Heisuke 
Hironaka of our prefecture, is currently formulating a policy 
for promotion of science and technology in the prefecture. We 
have established a regional foundation for the promotion of 
science and technology and using this as a basic source we have 
established a prize for the promotion of science and technology 
and are also vigorously supporting basic scientific R&amp;D. We 
are 
also fully aware that one major issue is to determine just how 
we can, through exchanges among the corporations, skilfully 
utilize the very high level of accomplishments in technology and 
technical personnel possessed by the large corporations in our 
prefecture in order to raise the levels of small businesses. 
Currently, we are providing various kinds of support emphasizing 
mainly technology development projects, in such places as the 
Shunan Regional and Local Industrial Promotion Center, and the 
Yamaguchi-Bofu Center for Promotion of Industrial Arts and Local 
Industries. 
  In particular, in order to form a high quality technology 
complex consisting of regional small businesses with high 
technical sophistication, to support them in venturing into new 
fields, we are in the process of implementing as a management 
resource the Plan for the Activation of the Shunan Regional 
Small Business Complex, which was approved on 31 March of this 
year. 
  We are deeply involved in a project for constructing of a 
town built of new materials aimed at producing an environment 
that will make it easy for machine parts manufacturers that 
provide technical support to industries to manifest their 
creativity. and in a project to construct large-scale, high 
standard industrial parks that are appropriate to industrial 
activity in this age of technology. In this fashion, we are 
striving hard to establish Yamaguchi as a Technology Prefecture 
and in Yamaguchi, we have the Engineering Department of 
Yamaguchi University which boasts a the largest enrollment of 
new students in the Chuubu-Shikoku area numbering 640. Soon the 
Yamaguchi Junior College Branch of The Science University of 
Tokyo will become a four-year institution. We also have 
educational institutions such as the industrial high schools in 
Ube and Tokuyama, which are very well equipped for technology 
education. By aggressively strengthening collaboration among 
industry, government, and academia we wish to promote the 
development of industry based on these technologies.

<F P=106> Niigata, Key to Industrial Development on the Japan Sea Rim </F>
  [Text] Images of Niigata What kinds of images appear when 
you think of Niigata? I'm sure it is something like ``Snow, 
rice, sake, and far from Tokyo.'' But it's necessary to revise 
this image a bit. As for rice, koshihikari is the famous brand, 
the charming but dry Niigata Seishu is the popular choice in 
sake and in terms of supplying it, Niigata boasts being third in 
Japan As for snow, it abounds in the ski resort areas on the 
borders of the prefecture, but in recent years it hardly has 
accumulated at all in Niigata City or other areas along the Sea 
of Japan. The distance in time from Tokyo is now only one hour 
and forty minutes on the rapid Asahi that runs on the Joetsu 
Shinkansen Line. If you leave Niigata at 8 AM, you can make a 
meeting in Tokyo that starts at ten o'clock. 
  One might think that Niigata is primarily an area for 
farming 
and tourism, but actually it is the largest industrial region on 
the Sea of Japan. Since long ago, Niigata has been blessed with 
``snow, and then the water from its melting,'' forming a 
productive region that is provided with local industries that 
supply the needs for food, clothing and shelter. 
  The famous products and industries in Niigata include 
traditional Japanese clothing, which developed as a secondary 
winter industry for farmers in Tookamachi, Ojiya, and Shiozawa, 
synthetic fibers and knits in Gosen, Mitsuke, and Tochio. 
Tsubame and Sanjo, which originally produced Japanese-style 
nails, now after several transitions, form a base for processing 
metals in all fields. They are also famous for sake grown from 
rice and water, and Kamo is noted for its wardrobes made of 
pauwlonia wood. 
  In addition to these, since the beginning of the Meiji 
period, Niigata has produced ``burning water,'' i.e. petroleum, 
which fostered the development of a drilling machine industry, 
ultimately becoming the foundation for the machine manufacturing 
and metals processing industries centered around Nagaoka. These 
enterprises, which have become firmly established as locally 
based industries, play a major role in industrial development in 
the prefecture. 
  Challenges for Niigata Industry 
  Judging from the most recent trends in Niigata industry, 
there has been steady growth, but it is also true that the tempo 
has become somewhat lax. Niigata's ranking among the prefectures 
in delivery of products has dropped from 19th place in this 
decade to 23rd. Regarding the structure of industry here, there 
has been progress in establishing new businesses concomitant 
with the development of high speed transportation systems. While 
the processing and assembly industries, beginning with 
electronic and electrical machinery have become leading 
industries, they comprise only 35 percent, which is nine points 
lower than the national average. 99.6 percent of the more than 
20,000 manufacturing businesses in the prefecture are small 
businesses, many of which are subcontractors, so that the value 
added productivity is only two thirds of the national average. 
  Consequently, an urgent challenge is to increase the added 
value of Niigata's industries, but in order to achieve this, it 
is first essential to aim at facilitating local development by 
improving the technological strength and planning ability of the 
local industries that are diverse in nature and form a solid 
base in the prefecture. 
  It is also desirable for the prefecture to promote 
aggressively the attraction of new businesses, such as those in 
leading edge technology and information fields and those which 
possess R&amp;D capability, in order to bring about a change in 
the 
structure of industry and to strengthen cooperation between 
incoming businesses and businesses already existing in the 
prefecture. 
  It is desirable for the prefecture to take full advantage of 
the high speed transportation systems now in place, to aim for 
full activation of its potential by increasing the connectivity 
among businesses and industries. In order to achieve such 
objectives, it is currently developing and promoting the 
measures described below. 
  Towards Improvement of Technology in Corporations in the 
Prefecture First of all, the Shinano Technopolis, centered in 
Nagaoka city, has been achieving substantial results. Last 
April, a plan was adopted for the second quarter, whose 
conceptual basis is the ``establishment of a consortium of 
cities for exchange of industrial technology which will become 
the leader in the Age of the Japan Sea Rim.'' The consortium has 
benefited from the arrival of new businesses and the development 
of corporations, and takes pride in having achieved the highest 
level among all technopolises in Japan in terms of the number of 
new sites established for business and the number of securities 
issued. 
  Within the rim area, the Laser Application Engineering 
Center 
has been set up as one facet of a project to provide a national 
research base, and the prefecture has positioned laser 
processing as a major technology that will have great ripple 
effect on local industries. In promoting the center, it is 
working towards the dissemination of technology to local 
businesses. 
  Nagaoka City has been designated as a regional focal point, 
but it is also promoting the Office Arcadia Concept and 
anticipates the establishment of research institutes, training 
institutions and information-related businesses there. 
  Secondly, an industrial engineering center and under it six 
research institutes, set up by region and type of industry are 
conducting actual R&amp;D and business leadership, playing a 
major 
role in improving the technology of local production industries. 
  Concomitant with the changes in environment related to 
economic and technological developments, the need is increasing 
for strengthening collaboration between industry, academia, and 
government in R&amp;D, development of human resources, and 
technology exchange, and for promoting R&amp;D in the fields of 
technology that will form the base for progress in the 
prefecture in the 21st century. A ``technotank'' concept ,which 
is supposed to materialize this year, has been formulated in 
order to realize this effectively. 
  For this reason, this year they are slated to formulate a 
basic plan by surveying the (current) status of the laboratory 
and research infrastructure, and conducting a needs analysis for 
technology development in the prefecture. Third, with the 
objective of incorporating a design viewpoint into commercial 
product production and business management, the Niigata 
Prefecture Life and Culture Creative Industry Foundation 
(commonly called the IDS Corporation) is active. Every February, 
Niigata sponsors an IDS design competition in order to determine 
the possibilities for the NEXT products from Niigata. It 
receives many entries from local industries. The outstanding 
participants receive guidance from specialists ( The Open 
Laboratory) on developing their entries into products. 
  Fourth, implementation of measures for local small 
industries 
is a crucial task. The ``Law to Vitalize the Concentration of 
Local Small Businesses'' that was implemented last year is 
considered very effective for promoting the development of new 
fields of local industry in the prefecture. Those areas 
attempting the development of new fields are working on the 
gradual implementation of activation plans. Progress is also 
being made in establishing facilities for activation of local 
small businesses via local industry promotion centers in two 
locations, and the Sanjo branch of the College of Small Business. 
  Fifth, in order to accelerate the location of businesses 
here, the prefecture is promoting prefecture-managed large scale 
industrial zones in three locations, and core industrial zones 
for public corporations for encouraging regional development. In 
order to increase opportunities for interchange between newly 
established and local businesses and strengthen cooperation 
between them, the prefecture has established the ``Niigata Link 
Project'' effective this fiscal year. 
  Extending The Basis for the Japan Sea Rim Exchange Sphere 
  We expect the Age of the Japan Sea Rim to arrive with the 
21st century, which is just around the corner. Exchanges with 
countries bordering the shore of the Japan Sea will become 
increasingly active and the role played by areas along the Japan 
Sea are expected to grow in importance. By establishing the 
position of the prefecture as the gateway to the Japan Sea, and 
at the same time strengthening collaborative and cooperative 
relationships with neighboring prefectures, it is promoting the 
``Japan Sea Kan'etsu Belt Zone Development Plan'' as the central 
strategic task of the prefecture. This will even further 
heighten the centrality of the prefecture as a node which ties 
it to the Kanto region via a high-speed transportation system. 
  Niigata has been the only city to be connected to the 
Russian 
Far East directly by air route, but as of this April, regular 
air service with Vladivostok has been established. The runway at 
the Niigata Airport is currently being extended to 2500 m, and 
plans are under way to further expand it to 3000 m and to 
improve access to the airport including direct access to the JR 
Line. 
  Since 1989, an annual Japan Sea Rim International Forum has 
been held. It will establish a Japan Sea Rim Economic Research 
Institute as a think tank to play a central role in generating 
information about Japan Sea Rim exchanges and in conducting 
survey research. Also, in order to promote economic exchanges, a 
basic plan aimed at introducing FAZ this fiscal year, and a 
survey designed to activate and make efficient the exchange of 
products within the prefecture, is being conducted. 
  We want to construct a Niigata Prefecture that plays a vital 
role, by working collaboratively to create a base for exchange 
throughout the Japan Sea Rim area, and by producing high added 
value to the industries described above.

  [Text] The National Institute for Research in Inorganic 
Materials, STA, has succeeded in synthesizing diamond from 
fullerene crystals (C[.sup]60[/], soccer ball shaped carbon 
molecules) by using shock compression. The synthetic diamonds 
obtained by using fullerene crystals as a starting material are 
ultrafine particles about 10 nm in diameter. The yield is about 
50% of the starting material at about 20 GPa and when the 
pressure is increased to 50 GPa, the yield reaches almost 
90%. 
This yield is very high, about ten times the yields obtained 
using other forms of carbon (such as graphite, glassy carbon, 
etc.) 
  Conventional carbon materials are difficult to convert into 
diamond, even with shock compression. Even if diamond is formed, 
the yields have been low at less than 10%. On the other 
hand, 
methods for synthesizing large amounts of C[.sup]60[/] and 
C[.sup]70[/] fullerene crystals have been established, so 
they are now easy to obtain, and this has spurred activity in 
various types of experimental and theoretical research. 
  The No. 8 research group at NIRIM focused on fullerene 
crystals as a new starting material for diamond synthesis. In 
C[.sup]60[/] crystals, the C[.sub]60[/] molecules have a 
spherical, cage-like structure held together by Van der Waals 
forces, which are relatively weak. 
  The C[.sup]60[/] molecules form a dodecahedron consisting 
of 20 six-membered rings and 20 five-membered rings. The five- 
and six-membered rings in the molecules contain two different 
types of bond angles and bond lengths that are similar to the 
SP[.sup]3[/] bond configurations of diamond in some places. 
Therefore, the researchers hoped they would be easy to convert 
to diamond. 
  Following this line of thought, researchers used shock 
compression and successfully obtained high yields of synthetic 
diamond. 
  The fullerene starting materials were in the form of 
rectangular or hexagonal fine particles, and they were mixed 
with copper powder and pressure molded. The samples were 
subjected to a shock wave from a single-shot gun using a 
gunpowder cartridge and recovered in two containers made of 
different types of material, stainless steel and copper. Then 
the copper was removed from the sample by treating it with acid, 
and the phase was determined by X-ray diffraction of the sample 
powder. Results confirmed that synthetic diamond had been formed 
at a high yield. 
  This diamond takes the form of ultrafine particles similar 
to 
the diamond recovered from the carbon in gunpowder. The yield 
ranged from 50-90% of the starting material depending on 
the 
conditions of the shock compression. Researchers conducted 
synthesis on samples of mixed C[.sup]60[/] and 
C[.sup]70[/] molecules, and on C[.sub]60[/] molecules 
alone. 
  Researchers at NIRIM believe this product can be used for 
polishing mirror surfaces, etc., but they also believe the 
material costs will be too high. In these experiments the 
researchers went up to 90 GPa of pressure, but they found that 
when they surpassed 50 GPa, the synthetic diamond disappeared 
and was converted into another unknown substance. Researchers 
plan to work hard to clarify this phenomenon and proceed with 
the search for new post-diamond phase materials and 
superconductors.

  [Text] Cooperation with Uruguay in plastics testing 
technology has begun in earnest, mainly under the direction of 
MITI. The purpose of this cooperation is to transfer product and 
material testing and inspection technology that is essential to 
the growth of the plastics manufacturing industry. The 
installation of testing and inspection equipment is near 
completion, and increasing numbers of expert engineers are being 
dispatched from Japan, so the transfer of technology has moved 
into the implementation phase. MITI plans to implement the same 
kind of technical cooperation in Asia, and Uruguay will be used 
as a model program. 
  Technical cooperation between Japan and Uruguay has already 
been implmented to improve the quality of pulp and paper, and 
success in that area has expanded to plastics testing. Japan 
signed an agreement for technical cooperation in March 1991 with 
LATU, the Uruguay Technical Laboratory under the Ministry of 
Industry, Energy, and Mining [literal]. A plastics research lab 
was set up at LATU, and transfer of testing technology began. 
  The technology tranfer is being coordinated in Japan through 
MITI and the Japan High Polymer Center. First about fifty types 
of the necessary testing and inspection equipment were chosen, 
and Japan began sending expert engineers to Uruguay as the 
equipment was installed. Recently planning discussions were held 
on site, and it was decided that Japan will increase the number 
of short-term engineers in addition to those dispatched for 
longer periods of time. The range of objects being tested is 
also expanding as LATU will begin to provide testing services to 
private businesses on consignment. 
  This technical cooperation will last for four years until 
March 1995. Japan will continue to provide cooperation to 
Uruguay to aid in its transition from an agricultural to an 
industrial nation. Japan considers the plastics manufacturing 
industry one cornerstone for this transition.

  [Text] A joint research group from Gumma School of 
Technology, the Railway Technical Research Institute, and Tokai 
University have succeeded in increasing the strength of 
composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic 
(CRFP). The group developed a technique that uses a 
photochemical reaction as a pretreatment during manufacturing to 
untangle the carbon fibers, which enables uniform dispersion of 
the fibers throughout the composite material. Uniform dispersion 
is essential for increased strength. The group is aiming for 
rapid practical application of this technique as a pretreatment 
to achieve higher quality more easily and lower manufacturing 
costs. 
  The developers are professor Akira Kojima and assistant 
professor Ryoichi Akabane from Gumma School of Technology, 
researchers from the Railway Technical Research Institute, and a 
group led by professor Sugiro Otani, Faculty of Developmental 
Engineering, Tokai University. 
  When CFRP and carbon fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC) are 
manufactured, pretreatment is required to efficiently disperse 
the carbon fibers in resin, etc. This new technique concerns a 
pretreatment that neatly separates individual carbon fibers, 
which are usually all tangled together. 
  In the past separation has been accomplished by oxidizing 
the 
surfaces of heated carbon fibers by electrolytic or chemical 
methods to break the bonds between them. This joint research 
group used a photochemical reaction instead for oxidation. 
  The new method involves applying a coating to the surfaces 
of 
the carbon fibers that releases activated oxygen when it is 
exposed to light, and then exposing the fibers to sunlight. In 
the sunlight, activated oxygen, which has a negative charge and 
acts powerfully to break the links between carbon atoms, is 
formed on the surfaces of the fibers, and the carbon fibers 
neatly untangle and disperse. 
  Methylene blue was used in the experiments as a coating, and 
after it was applied to a bundle of about 3000 carbon fibers, 
they were exposed to sunlight. When researchers put the carbon 
fibers in resin and measured the amount of dispersion (wetting 
strength), it was about three times greater than before the 
pretreatment. When researchers mixed the carbon fibers with 
cement and formed CFRC, the strength was 1.6 times greater than 
that of CFRC manufactured by past methods. 
  Professor Kojima says, ``This new technique requires no 
special equipment and should be easy to implement right on the 
assembly line.'' 
  Composite materials are used in golf clubs and aircraft 
because they are very strong and lightweight. If material costs 
can be reduced because of this development, we can expect 
composite materials to find a wider range of uses such as in 
railway coaches and manufactured products in general.

  [Text] Researchers working on the Kimura Metamelt Project 
at the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) have 
found that the density of liquid silicon changes over time and 
shows abnormality in temperature dependency, both of which 
suggest a structural change in liquid silicon on the atomic 
level. In the past, it was believed that the density of liquid 
silicon changed in a linear manner, but when researchers 
measured the density with a measuring device they developed, 
they found that the rate of change in density was different 
depending on the temperature region, and they also confirmed 
that the density changed over time. By controlling the liquid 
silicon with these parameters, it should be possible to improve 
the quality of silicon crystals when they are pulled 
[Czochralski Process] and also to increase the yield. These 
results were announced on 10 December at the meeting to report 
on research in Operations To Promote Innovative Science and 
Technology at JRDC held at the Keidanren Hall in Otemachi, Tokyo. 
  To measure the density of the liquid precisely in the Kimura 
Project, a method based on Archimedes Principle was adopted that 
uses a dual probe to cancel the effect of surface tension when a 
float with a constant volume is submerged in the liquid. The 
float is made of graphite and coated with silicon carbide like a 
crucible to give it heat resistance. This enables highly precise 
measurements to an accuracy of 1%. 
  Researchers measured the density of silicon liquid with this 
device. When they plotted a graph of density vs. temperature, 
they found that the slope of the change in density (temperature 
dependency) was different in three separate regions. Density is 
an important quantity reflecting the number of atoms and the 
distance between adjacent atoms. Until now it was believed that 
the density decreased linearly and that silicon liquid changed 
linearly from a semiconductor to a metal. However, with this 
recent confirmation that the slope of the change in density is 
different in low-, mid-, and high-temperature regions, 
researchers now believe that when silicon first begins to melt 
it forms giant aggregates of atoms (clusters) with covalent 
bonds, in the mid-temperature range it becomes a mixture of 
metallic atoms and chains of atoms with covalent bonds, and in 
the high-temperature range the atoms all become metallic. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-07A>           Temperature Dependency of Density in Liquid Silicon </FIG>




  Researchers also studied the change of density over time at 
1431C, which is the boundary between the low- and 
mid-temperature regions. After melting began, the density rose 
for three hours and then gradually fell off. Researchers believe 
this means that the covalent bonds require time to be broken, 
and this phenomenon appears as a change in density over time. 
  The discovery of this phenomenon provides the first 
scientific corroboration of know-how learned through experience 
at silicon crystal-pulling sites such as the saying: ``You get 
high quality crystals if you wait two or three hours after 
melting before you pull.'' 
  Researchers have not only obtained some clues on controlling 
the liquid by noting this change in its properties, but this 
discovery also opens the door to a dramatic reduction in the 
density of defects in pulled crystals, etc.

  [Text] NEC has used the Czochralski (CZ) technique to pull 
single crystals of the non-linear optics element barium boroxide 
(BBO), and has begun commercial sales of BBO single crystals 
through NEC Environmental Engineering (Minato-ku, Tokyo). BBO is 
the only optics material that can convert visible wavelengths to 
the short wavelengths in the ultraviolet region. Using the CZ 
method to grow crystals of the low temperature or _b_ phase, 
which has this non-linear optics effect, had been considered 
nearly impossible, but NEC purified CZ starting materials, 
controlled the temperature, controlled the crystal orientation, 
etc., to obtain crystals with the same or higher quality than 
with previous methods but at rates 20-30 times faster. In the 
future the price is expected to drop to about one-third the 
present price after mass production technology for making larger 
crystals is set up. 
  In the CZ method for pulling BBO crystals, crystallization 
begins in the high temperature _a_ phase if the temperature is 
merely lowered. NEC developed the basic technology for 
crystallization beginning with the low temperature phase in 
1989, and NEC engineers made several modifications to achieve 
practical application of the CZ method based on their 
development. As a result they obtained BBO crystals 50 long and 
15-16 in diameter. For the time being they will offer these 
crystals at the price of their least expensive line of previous 
BBO crystals. In the future, with the establishment of mass 
production technology such as larger crucibles, NEC expects to 
lower the price to about one-third the present price. 
  Associated with this crystal pulling technology they are 
using, NEC engineers have made inexpensive, high-quality 
starting material by sintering _b_ phase powder obtained by 
chemical precipitation, established a technique for _b_ phase 
seed crystals that do not change phase even when they come in 
direct contact with the melt, and established a technique to 
control the melt temperature so that the melt crystallizes at 
the _b_ phase from the onset. The engineers have also devices a 
method to control melt convection so that crystal orientation 
remains consistent during the forming process. 
  BBO was originally developed in China, and currently several 
companies in the U.S. and China manufacture it by the flux 
method and sell it. Japan depends on imports from China for its 
whole supply. The flux method enables crystals to be grown at 
the low temperature _b_ phase by introducing a sodium carbide 
flux into the melt. However, this method not only introduces 
impurities such as sodium, but crystal growth is a slow 1 per 
day, which keeps the cost high. 
  However, BBO crystals produced by the CZ method are high 
quality because there is no flux in the melt, and their optical 
properties such as loss of absorption and conversion efficiency 
are equal to or better than crystals obtained by the flux 
method. Moreover, their threshold value for destruction by laser 
is about 30% greater than crystals produced by the flux 
method, 
and they are not easily destroyed even when exposed to 
high-output lasers. BBO can convert the wavelengths of YAG and 
argon lasers to one-half and one-fourth, and they can be easily 
used in compact UV light generators. We can expect that the 
capability of growing high-quality BBO single crystals at low 
cost will spur the development of laser UV light generators.

  [Text] A survey by the Japan Light Metal Association has 
found that current light metal and steel automobile wheels with 
diameters greater than 15 inches show a distinct difference in 
weight. With the goal of finding out any trends in auto wheel 
weight in the marketplace and providing basic resource data for 
future wheel manufacturing, the Light Metal Wheel Committee of 
the Japan Light Metal Association conducted a study in June and 
July of this year. The committee conducted a survey on steel 
wheels and the light metal alloy wheels (solid and fabricated) 
manufactured by the companies comprising the committee, and they 
looked at the narrowest, widest, and greatest quantity (the 
average value for the product made and sold in the greatest 
quantity) for each rim size. 
  The results show that although the survey makes no 
distinction between wheels used on passenger cars and those used 
on trucks and busses, there is a large difference in weight 
between light metal alloy wheels and steel wheels when they are 
used on trucks and busses. 
  Among light metal alloy solid wheels, those with the 
narrowest rims seek lighter weight, whereas attractive design is 
most valued in those with the widest rims. In the 17 inch 
wheels, the study found weight differences as large as 6.8 kg. 
In the case of light metal fabricated wheels, however, the 
change in the weight difference at each rim size was not as 
clear cut. 



  Because there is no clear distinction between steel wheels 
used on passenger cars and trucks, a simple comparison is 
difficult, but the variation in weight difference for each rim 
size of the narrowest wheels represented only the difference in 
volume, and there was almost no variation due to design. 
  As a result, the committee learned that the change in the 
weight difference at each rim size varies similarly for both 
steel wheels and light metal alloy solid wheels. There was 
almost no difference in weight between solid and fabricated 
light metal alloy wheels, and when there was a difference it was 
less than one kilogram. However, the difference between light 
metal alloy wheels and steel wheels grows larger over 15, 16, 
and 18 inches, with the difference being 5-6 kg at 16 inches, 
and about 18 kg at 18 inches.

  [Text] Ishikawa-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI) has 
established the possibility of developing system control 
technology for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) plant 
scheduled to be built in FY97, four years from now. This is 
because of their success in establishing design technology and 
obtaining basic data for simulations for a 1,000kW class plant 
based on start-up and stopping, load change, emergency stoppage 
and other tests using an 100kW class system control test 
facility, which is a step toward moving up to the 1,000kW class. 
Along with the fact that control of interpolar pressure 
differences in the fuel cell itself are important in this, 
reduction in the start-up time and reduction of high-temperature 
valves, which are expensive and are a source of thermal 
dispersion are necessary, since the fuel cell operating 
temperature is approximately 650C. 
  IHI began developing MCFC fuel cells in 1983, and since 1987 
it has participated in the MCFC Research Association and has 
been working on the development of system and control technology. 
  Since 1991, when the 100kW class system control test 
facility 
(with a mock fuel cell) was set up at the MCFC Research 
Association's comprehensive laboratory in Akagi, data that will 
affect the design, construction and operation of a future 
1,000kW class pilot plant has been acquired. This research is 
being carried out as part of a research consignment to the MCFC 
Research Association from the New Energy Development 
Organization (NEDO) as a part of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology (AIST) Moonshine Project. 
  ``Load change rate,'' ``fuel cell interpole pressure 
differences,'' ``start-up time,'' ``operating time'' and 
``NO[.sup]X[/]'' value were brought up as results of this 
research. 
  The test facility has sufficient capacity for the 100kW 
class 
and the 1,000kW class, and the basic configuration is the same. 
Since at the time the facility was set up, the fuel cell was 
still being developed, a mock fuel cell was used. This is made 
up of anode (fuel pole) and cathode (air pole) heaters that 
simulate the heat generated and a fuel cell receptacle that 
gives the reference pressure for interpole pressure control. The 
voltage and output for fuel cell performance are computed in 
real time through incorporation of an equation in the controller 
and measurement of inlet gas formation and flow. 
  The results of the tests were that there is a necessity for 
considering a layout that greatly reduces the radiant heat loss 
from the distribution pipes, temperature maintenance and pipe 
support system for reduction of the time from the ignition of 
the reformer to the start of reformation and changing the 
operating temperature of the anode gas blower that circulates 
the N[.sup]2[/] gas for heating to a high-temperature 
specification. 
  It was confirmed that increasing the amount of fuel, taking 
the output and using the heat generated in the fuel cell, while 
continuing to raise the temperature of the fuel cell, was 
effective for decreasing the time from fuel cell intrusion to 
100% output. 
  Since the MCFC is normally in a molten state, there is a 
necessity for maintaining the interpole pressure on the 
electrolyte at several kilopascals or less in order to prevent 
electrolyte loss. The results of the tests confirmed that there 
was sufficient margin for the limit values during ordinary 
operation. In order to keep the interpole pressure difference 
during emergency stoppages for problems within the target of 
eight kilopascals, construction of a system for simultaneously 
shutting down the cut-off valves before and after the fuel cell 
was necessary. 
  Besides this, in minimum load tests, it was made clear that 
stable operation down to 15% was possible with the planned 
control method, for the target value of 30%. 
  At IHI, this control data will be supplied as effective data 
for design of the 1,000kW class MCFC pilot plant that is 
scheduled to be constructed by the end of FY97.

  [Text] In response to the fact that needs for hydrogen at 
oil refineries are rapidly increasing, the Petroleum Energy 
Center (PEC, Yasukoh Tachiuchi, Chairman) has been working on 
developing technology for separating hydrogen sulfide from sour 
gas and furthermore, recovering hydrogen from the hydrogen 
sulfide, but recently, with a 430 square meter single cell 
ion-exchange membrane test tank, the ability to separate and 
recover 99% pure hydrogen and 99% or purer sulfur 
was 
confirmed. Along with increasing the area of the electrolytic 
cell to 6,000 square meters after this, economics research on 
processing for a daily production scale of several hundred tons, 
which would make it practical, will be carried out. 
  The hydrogen supply for oil refineries generally makes use 
of 
hydrogen production units or secondary hydrogen from contact 
catalyst reformers (CCR). Besides the fact that demand for 
hydrogen is growing yearly due to desulfurization in the process 
of refining crude oil and conversion to purer fuels by means of 
product upgrades, there has been a leap in uses such as deep 
desulfurization of diesel fuel. 
  In addition, with the prospects for future introduction of 
equipment for hydrogenation decomposition of heavy petroleum, 
the quantities of hydrogen necessary can only be seen as 
increasing. However, since there is also the problem of hydrogen 
production facilities being costly to construct, hydrogenation 
desulfurizers are used to produce hydrogen sulfide, and the 
sulfur is recovered through thermal decomposition. Therefore, 
there are expectations for recovery of hydrogen from sour gas 
that includes hydrogen sulfide. 
  PEC combined wet absorption and an electrolytic reaction, 
separated hydrogen sulfide from sour gas and furthermore 
separated hydrogen and sulfur from the hydrogen sulfide, making 
progress in technical developments that will help in efficient 
use of hydrogen at oil refineries. 
  As a result, highly efficient recovery of hydrogen from the 
hydrogen sulfide separated from sour gas with a with a 430 
square meter single cell ion-exchange membrane test tank was 
confirmed. The hydrogen recovered has a purity of 99% and 
the 
sulfur a purity of 99% or greater. Based on these 
results, PEC 
is now planning to increase the area of the electrolytic cell to 
6,000 square meters to help in establishing recovery technology. 
  On the other hand, processing for a daily production of 
several hundred tons is necessary for practical application, and 
there are plans for conducting examinations of economic 
practicality at the same time.

  [Text] Prof. Shoichi Anpo et al. of the School of 
Engineering of University of Osaka Prefecture have successfully 
accomplished the direct separation of NO[.sup]X[/] into 
nitrogen and oxygen at room temperature. This, in combination 
with the technology for concentrating NO[.sup]X[/] and 
carrying out absorption and desorption that is being developed 
by the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Osaka 
Prefecture (Shiro Akita, head), is aimed at construction of an 
NO[.sup]X[/]removal system for automobile tunnels, etc. The 
development of this system is being pushed forward by Prof. Anpo 
and the Industrial Technology Research Institute under 
consignment from the Osaka Prefecture Coordinating Council for 
Global Environmental Problems, and the outlook is for its 
becoming practical in two years. 
  When a catalyst in which copper ions are fixed to zeolite 
(ZSM5) is vacuum exhausted at high temperatures, the copper ions 
are reduced. Anpo et al. conditioned an new optical catalyst in 
which these reduced ions are fixed to zeolite. When this optical 
catalyst has absorbed NO[.sup]X[/] and was exposed to light, 
the NO[.sup]X[/] was separated into oxygen and nitrogen. 
Attention has been drawn to the fact that catalysts in which 
copper ions are carried by zeolite can directly separate 
NO[.sup]X[/], but in such cases high temperature heating is 
necessary. The main feature of this optical catalyst is the 
direct separation of NO[.sup]X[/] at room temperature. 
  In NO[.sup]X[/] removal systems, after the exhaust is 
sucked up by fans and absorbed and concentrated using activated 
carbon, it is heated and desorbed. The desorbed NO[.sup]X[/] 
is transferred to a separation unit that uses the optical 
catalyst and purified through separation into and discharging of 
nitrogen and oxygen. Development is being promoted with the goal 
of making a single practical unit that combines these operations 
within two years. 
  In addition, the idea is to install this system in road 
tunnels and the like, but it is also theoretically possible to 
install them as exhaust processing systems for automobiles, such 
as busses and trucks, that have diesel engines; if small sized 
systems can be made, these can be seen as becoming practical.

  [Text] Prof. Katsumi Kaneko et al. of the Chiba University 
Department of Physical Science have found out that, by cladding 
activated carbon fibers with magnesium oxide or magnesium 
hydroxide, absorption of methane gas can be increased 1.5 times. 
These results tie in to a solution for the problem of methane 
tanks taking up space in compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, 
which are drawing attention as low pollution vehicles. 
  Prof. Kaneko et al. focused on the phenomenon of gasses 
being 
compressed on solid surfaces when the gas molecules are absorbed 
and used this on methane. Normally, porous absorbents that have 
many microscopic holes can absorb large volumes of gas molecules 
through the physical strength of the solid surface. However, 
since at room temperature methane is in a super-critical state 
that differs from normal gasses or liquids, it is a ``dry'' 
molecule is not absorbed easily by solid surfaces. 
  On the other hand, numerical computations have predicted 
that 
absorbents that have pores of the size of two methane molecules 
absorb methane comparatively easily. This is because methane 
molecules are efficiently affected by the physical strength from 
the surface of the holes they face, and an absorbent with hole 
diameters of about eight angstroms (8/10,000,000) into which two 
methane molecules just fit is necessary. 
  However, Kaneko et al. saw that just considering the size of 
the pores was not enough and also approached the problem from 
another direction. They found that if magnesium oxide or 
magnesium hydroxide is dispersed on the surface of activated 
carbon fibers, these materials change the properties of methane 
molecules and make absorption by the solid surface easier. In 
addition, they found that the amount of the increase in 
absorption varies with the type of absorbent, the type of metal 
oxide or hydroxide dispersed and the pressure of the methane. 
  Kaneko et al. see that ``there are possibilities for use of 
absorbents with dispersed metal oxides or hydroxides in fuel 
tanks for automobiles.'' From here on, they will aim at 
development of methane absorbents on a level that can replace 
methane tanks in automobiles.

  [Text] The research group of Prof. Yusaku Takita et al. of 
the Oita University School of Engineering has been successful in 
efficiently separating Freon 12, which is used in automobile air 
conditioners, etc., into carbon dioxide with a newly developed 
fine-grain catalyst. If the reaction takes place at 550C, 
almost all of the original freon is separated, and after five 
hours, a separation rate of approximately 70% can be 
maintained. This means the creation of a low-cost catalyst with 
a long life, which has been the problem with catalytic 
separation of freon up to now, and it opens the path to mass 
processing. 
  Since freon is chemically stable, combustion decomposition 
methods have been used for separation processing. However, a 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-11A>           Normal Pressure Fixed Bed Flow-Through Reaction Apparatus </FIG>

high temperature of 800C is necessary, and after 
incineration hydrofluoric acid forms, so there are problems such 
as corrosion of the incinerator. 
  Takita et al. focussed on catalytic separation methods that 
have low temperatures and developed a new catalyst. This is one 
in which zirconium oxide (33%) and chromium oxide 
(67%) are 
agitated in an aqueous solution of metal nitrates, the water 
evaporated off and the remainder fired at 500C in an air 
atmosphere for five hours; after this, it is pressed and formed 
into fine spherical grains. In the freon separation experiment, 
an apparatus in which one part freon, five parts air and three 
parts water vapor were supplied to a pass-through type electric 
furnace was used, and the catalyst was set up in the center of 
the furnace. 



  Using one gram of catalyst and introducing 18cc of the 
mixture (2cc of which were freon) into the furnace at a 
temperature of 550C, 80% was separated into carbon 
dioxide, and the remainder was absorbed in an alkaline solution 
in the form of a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, etc. In 
addition, if the concentration of the freon in the mixture is 
reduced to 2.7% separation into carbon dioxide at a yield 
of 
90% was possible. 
  Prof. Takita said, "From here on we will set up a miniplant, 
and work on development of a long life catalyst and improvement 
of the separation rate."

  [Text] Toyo Sanso K.K. (Hidetoku Inoyama, president) has 
developed a new combustion method that doubles the efficiency of 
the processing of gaseous materials such as silane that are 
exhausted in semiconductor production processes. Combustible 
gasses and air are introduced to the waste gas from outside and 
the combustion temperature raised to increase the combustion 
efficiency. Recently, since silane is diluted and then exhausted 
at semiconductor plants, the amount of waste gas is large, and 
large combustors have become necessary. In contrast to this, 
this new system is said to be appropriate for semiconductor 
plants, since with it a combustor of half the size can be used 
with the same volume of waste gas. Toyo Sanso has plans to 
incorporate this technology into a waste gas processing system 
and put it on the market in the near future. 
  The new combustion system developed by Toyo Sanso is 
technology for setting up a three layered pipe in the combustor, 
in which waste gas for processing silane, etc. flows through the 
innermost part, hydrocarbons through the layer outside that and 
a mixture of air and combustible gasses in the outermost layer. 
The combustor has also been improved to make for a construction 
that reduces heat loss. By optimally controlling the mixture 
ratio of air and combustible gasses, the combustion temperature 
is raised, and the combustion efficiency is improved using less 
combustible gas that with conventional combustion methods. At 
the same time, the problem of incomplete combustion is solved, 
and combustion exhaust no longer contains harmful materials. 
  Silane is an easily combusted gas, but at semiconductor 
plants recently, it is diluted with nitrogen and the like to a 
concentration of several percent silane in order to prevent 
explosions or fires. Because of this, the gas to be processed is 
not easily burned, the amount large, and large combustors have 
become necessary. Silane, which is a compound of silicon and 
hydrogen, produces silicon oxide with combustion, and silicon 
oxide powder grows in a mushroom shape at the tips of nozzles 
and closes them off. With Toyo Sanso's combustion system, this 
problem is solved by controlling the high-temperature combustion 
so that it takes place at a distance from the nozzle.

  [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka, 
(GIRI, Osaka) of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST) has been successful in an experimental conversion of 
carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/])into methanol using gold, which 
has been thought to be chemically inactive, as a catalyst. At a 
temperature of 250C, about 50C lower than with a 
copper catalyst, the same degree of efficiency in methanol 
synthesis was possible. Along with being useful for fixation and 
recovery of atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of 
global warming, this also has applications in systems for 
converting hydrogen into methanol and transporting it. 
  The gold catalyst experiment was carried out by Masaki 
Haruta, the head, and Hiroaki Sakurai, a researcher, of the 
Catalytic Chemistry Laboratory of GIRI, Osaka. When a mixture of 
CO[.sup]2[/] and hydrogen gasses under a pressure of 50 
atmospheres was passed through iron oxide affixed to gold, 
approximately 5% of the CO[.sup]2[/] combined with hydrogen 
to form methanol. The gold and iron oxide exhibited the greatest 
activity at 250C. Copper and zinc oxide is known as a 
catalyst for converting CO[.sup]2[/] into methanol, and the 
gold catalyst has the same synthesis efficiency as this. In 
addition, the copper catalyst exhibits the greatest activity at 
a temperature of 300C, and at 250C, the gold/iron 
oxide catalyst is more efficient. 
  Following this, GIRI, Osaka plans to mix in aluminum oxide, 
etc., and make smaller granules of gold to increase the 
activity. Conventionally, gold is considered to have poor 
chemical activity and not to be useful as a catalyst, but 
recently researchers have learned that it converts carbon 
monoxide (CO) into C0[.sup]2[/] at a temperature of -70C 
and can separate out the odorous components of trimethylamine. 
  Methanol is a basic chemical product that is also raw 
material for thermosetting resins, but recently conversion of 
hydrogen, which has the danger of exploding, into methanol for 
transportation has attracted attention. The ``WE-NET Concept'' 
proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) is a project for using the solar energy of overseas 
deserts to separate water and generate hydrogen and react the 
hydrogen with CO[.sup]2[/] to generate methanol for 
transportation, and practical research is being started this 
year.

companies, Hitachi, Ltd., Toshiba, and the U.S. company General 
Electric. 
  The ABWR uses a large capacity turbine, which gives it a 
thermal efficiency of 34.5%, 1.1% better than 
previous BWRs. 
Its output will be 1,356,000 kW, the largest in Japan. 
Modifications include placing the recirculation pump inside the 
pressure vessel rather than outside to simplify the piping 
system. 
  Two plants are under construction at Kashiwazaki. As of the 
end of October, NPP No. 6 was 50.6% completed and No. 7 
was 
22.3% completed. Every day seventy concrete mixers go in 
and 
out of the facility, and so far they have poured enough wet 
concrete to fill the Tokyo Dome twice. 
  Kashiwazaki faces the Sea of Japan and experiences harsh 
winters. Plant director Masao Takuma says, ``The length of the 
construction period will depend on how efficiently we can work 
during the three winter months.'' 
  Another important problem has been how to counteract winter 
lightning. Lightning in the Kanto area has about 10,000 amps of 
current, but at Kashiwazaki it can reach 150,000 amps. The power 
plant is susceptible to direct strikes because it sits on a 
sandy beach. Tokyo Electric Power had the Central Research 
Institute of the Electric Power Industry design a special tower 
150 meters high as a lightning rod. They expect it to capture 
80% of the lightning. 
  NPP No. 7, which is being built by Hitachi, sports the 
world's largest self-propelled crane. The steel girders were 
subassembled first at the factory, transported all at once, and 
assembled on site. This crane has a maximum capacity of 840 
tons. Using the crane enables much faster setup than building a 
scaffold and stacking up the girders one at a time. 
  On the other hand, the NPP No. 6 construction site, 
supervised by Toshiba, is covered by a roof to create an 
environment with total climate control that is unaffected by the 
weather. This idea came up to handle the heavy snowfall at 
Kashiwazaki. The steel frame supporting the roof will be buried 
in the walls of the building after the reactor core is finished. 
Because the roof receives its strength from a meshwork of 
interwoven steel girders, the steel frame is no longer needed, 
but it eliminates the time and trouble of disassembly. 
  Generally speaking, electric power companies that use BWRs 
will equip their future plants with ABWRs. They will also use 
advanced construction methods that provide the speed of the 
huge, self-propelled crane and the pleasantness of total climate 
control at their future construction sites. We can also expect 
more modifications to the ABWRs in the future.

<H5>  The Scene Changes Day by Day </H5>
  Previously he was the director of the Electronics Technology 
Research Institute in the AIST Tsukuba Research Center of 
Ibaraki Prefecture. After assuming office, he revealed his 
impression that ``when I was in Tsukuba, I could sit and think 
of things at my leisure. But here, I have to think on the run. 
Since instant and correct decisions are required on the spot, 
every day is very busy.'' But, it is promising that ``since I 
can adapt to the environment, it is not painful. Rather, it is 
fun to have the scene changing rapidly every day.'' 
  Next year's estimated requirements for the MITI technology 
and development budget total &yen;301.7 billion. ``Compared to 
the overall severity, this is a rather fortunate decision for 
us,'' this was 7.5% growth compared to this year. In the 
industrial science and technology R&amp;D system which can also 
be 
called the eyeball of AIST, has become the plan to initiate five 
new themes of leading research such as precision polymer 
materials, high speed biological function construction 
technology (time machine bio), next generation metal resources 
production technology. 
  ``The themes were drawn together from the viewpoint that 
while prior research issues are modulated, they are becoming 
technology development to make a type of production systems 
revolution.'' Accordingly, the details are rich in variety and 
emphasize the beefing up and strengthening of basic creative 
research. 
<H5>  Bringing the World One Step Closer </H5>
  Among other things, the leading research theme expected by 
the chemical industry is ``precision polymer materials.'' This 
aims at the establishment of original technology for a polymer 
material to eliminate the disorder in chemical structure and 
superstructure and will result in the basic technology to 
develop the next generation of polymer materials. He has the 
deep insight that ``quantum mechanics was studied thoroughly in 
its golden age at the beginning of this century and at present 
that is actually tied to technology. I think one of those is 
this issue, and this is similar to bringing the world another 
step closer.'' 
<H5>  International Contributions Are Also a Major Issue </H5>
  Future issues are ``international contributions from the 
aspects of science and technology'' along with ``driving R&amp;D 
to 
produce a sprout of a new technology to become the breakthrough 
for industrial structural reform.'' Also, he also says ``I would 
like to get on that track'' concerning research for ATRAM 
technology (atomic and molecular limit operations technology) 
started this year in industrial technology fusion research 
institutes. 
  AIST shows dynamic change in recent years with the revision 
of the existing project system such as the reorganization of 
Tsukuba's research institutes and the big pro (Major industrial 
technology R&amp;D) system. 
  ``These all go along with the flow of the world, that is my 
view. I would like to be the helmsman so as not to mistake the 
direction while docilely following the demands, movement, and 
change in the natural environment of the world,'' he says, 
assuming a natural stance. 
  On days off, he enjoys yacht cruising and driving. He says 
that ``driving directly under the stars in an open car is the 
best feeling.'' He was born in 1934 (Showa year 9) and hails 
from Kanagawa Prefecture.

  [Text] Next year, the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology will introduce a new financing system in order to 
further research exchange with private companies in broad areas 
of research beginning with advanced science and technology 
research. For private research organizations planning the 
preparation for research exchange facilities and equipment, 
50% 
of the financing can be financed partially with facilities 
financing from the Japan Development Bank. With the idea that 
the object of financing in the first year will be the areas of 
global environment, new materials, electronics, the estimated 
requirements for the 1994 budget includes a total of &yen;10 
billion. 
  Regions to be the object of financing are research exchange 
facilities coupling the research institute with facilities for 
inviting researchers, research information exchange facilities, 
and general open facilities (halls, observation facilities, 
seminar and workshop rooms). For example, when a private company 
builds facilities on the scale of &yen;1 billion, 50% of 
that, 
&yen;500 million, will be low interest financing through the 
Japan Development Bank. Also the conditions of financing are set 
on a commercial basis. 
  According to AIST, semiconductors, life sciences, global 
environment, electronics, new materials, and comfortable 
environment are areas planned to be the object of financing. 
Definitely, research exchange facilities concerning 
CO[.sup]2[/] fixation technology which is one policy for the 
prevention of global warming, technology for the improvement of 
fine ceramics, and the residential environment are in the 
policies. 
  The importance of the promotion of research exchange is 
increasing with the start of planning for the ``Intellectual 
Contact International Plaza'' supporting advanced research 
exchange and the expansion of research and exchange affairs due 
to the partial revision of the New Technology Enterprise Act. 
This financing system aims for private energy being given to 
places for such research exchange.

<F P=106> [Article by Laurent Schwartz: ``A Computer Controlled by </F>
Thought''] 
  [Text] The brain orders, it obeys... Japanese 
researchers have been working in utmost secrecy on a machine 
controlled directly by brain waves. Disclosures of a discovery 
whose potential repercussions are incalculable. 
  Incredible... but true! One of the most powerful of the 
multinationals has embarked on a project that is crazy, crazy, 
crazy: Development of a system for controlling machines by 
thought. Let note be taken by those tempted to cry ``Hoax!'': 
This research, undertaken by Japan's Fujitsu group, is expected 
to yield, within 18 months, the ability of a computer to 
distinguish between a ``yes'' and a ``no,'' thought by an 
operator! The study is being conducted together with Hokkaido 
University's highly respected Institute for Electronic Science 
at Sapporo. The spitefully inclined might say that with some 165 
billion francs [Fr] of annual revenue, 162,000 employees, a 
worldwide number-two standing in electronics, and an annual 
investment budget of around Fr20 billion in research and 
development, one can afford to indulge in the loss of a few 
pennies, for the sake of prestige, in probing the frontiers of 
the imaginary. Except that, since April 1992, which marks the 
start of work on this project, the Japanese researchers have 
already achieved an amazing result: The recognition by a machine 
of the vowel-sound a thought by a human! 
  Should this research achieve its desired results, their 
repercussions on day-to-day living would be incalculable. 
Imagine a world in which humans would dialogue silently with and 
distantly from other humans.... The telephone would be relegated 
to the scrap heap of memories: Why bother to take it off the 
hook, dial a number, and talk? Black boxes installed in homes 
would transmit our wandering thoughts, via a network, in the 
form of written text or synthesized speech. You would merely 
have to think the access code of the person you want to contact. 
This would activate a screen or loudspeaker in that person's 
home or office to establish the contact. A boon for the 
intelligence services, which could thus secretly transmit 
information! Fujitsu's management envisions the ultimate 
man-machine interface: ``Today, we know how to control a 
wide-ranging gamut of household appliances by means of a 
computer. Control of the computer by thought could thus be of 
considerable aid to the severely handicapped. The speed at which 
data could be transmitted via such a system would be so high 
that it would outmode keyboards and other manual signaling 
devices,'' says Fujitsu's Research Department. Viewed from this 
angle, the prospect of issuing orders without lifting a finger, 
or opening one's mouth, can seem great indeed. Provided, 
however, that the process is not inverted by manufacturing... 
thought-reading machines! 
  The idea of developing a thought-controlled computer system 
took shape in August 1991. Two months earlier, Fujitsu's top 
management had made a highly unusual offer to its researchers: 
They could propose ultra-futuristic topics of research! Of 80 
themes received, three revolved around the translation of the 
brain's bioelectric activity into data that could be operated on 
by a computer. Tempted by the boldness of such a project, the 
management gave the researchers full freedom as to the research 
to be pursued, the cooperation to be enlisted, and even as to 
their working hours.... Tempted but prudent: The researchers 
were given exactly three years in which to obtain validating 
results. During those three years, there would be no special 
investment. At the conclusion of this period, one of two things: 
The researchers' experiments will either have yielded results, 
in which case a laboratory, indeed a building, would be built, 
specifically dedicated to the ``operation of computers by means 
of thought''; or will be spinning their wheels, in which case 
the researchers must show that they need more time to attain 
their objective, so as to be granted three more years. But in 
view of the results achieved on the recognition of a 
barely seven months following the start of work, it may be taken 
for granted as of now that the Japanese researchers can 
definitely count on six years of freedom of action. 
  Developing a thought-controlled system presupposes pursuit 
of 
two lines of research. First, a way must be found to somehow 
characterize human thought in material form. This represents a 
major challenge. Next, these thought-generated signals must be 
processed to translate them into an effective order that can be 
assimilated by an electronic device. This task is easier. The 
conversion of physical, electrical, or magnetic signals to 
numeric data is now commonplace. All computers possess such a 
converter. 
  Five researchers are currently working on the topic. Their 
first stage: Define in exact detail the type of ``interior 
language'' to be explored. ``Although there is still controversy 
on this point, a distinction is drawn between gratuitous thought 
and mental representation of the words that we are about to 
pronounce. It is on this second approach, in other words, a mode 
of thought that leads to an action, and specifically the 
activating of the muscles of the larynx and of the tongue, that 
we have worked,'' says Norio Fujimaki, apparently the sole 
Fujitsu researcher authorized to speak of the work being done. 
``Our objective is to characterize brain activity in terms of 
detailed, operative messages, hence in a language of action. We 
have given this language the name silent speech.'' A 
study conducted several months ago by two American 
neurobiologists of the University of Iowa appears to verify the 
existence of silent speech. They presented to 
patients with anatomically different cerebral lesions two series 
of diapositives, one showing objects, the other showing actions 
in the course of being performed. When the patients were asked 
to describe what they had seen, some patients committed errors 
on the names of the objects, others on the verbs representing 
the actions. Hence the idea that thought-language might follow 
different neuronal systems depending on whether objects or 
actions are evoked. 
  The topic of study having been determined, Norio Fujimaki 
spent several months at the University in Sapporo working 
alongside Professor Kuriki, an expert on electroencephalographic 
measurements. Fujitsu's researcher already had his plan in mind: 
Place a subject in two possible situations--one requiring that 
he produce silent speech, and the other corresponding 
to interior silence--and observe the subject's cerebral activity 
in each of the two cases for the purpose of comparison. ``For my 
first series of experiments, I chose the simplest of all 
electroencephalographic measurement techniques. By means of 
electrodes, the electrical currents produced by the neurons that 
enter into action can be measured within a fraction of a 
second.'' This is the method, entirely classic today, that has 
made it possible to draw the subtle distinction between a 
sleeping subject's paradoxical-sleep (dreams) and deep-sleep 
stages. ``I needed knowledgeable and perfectly disciplined 
subjects, able, on request, to think or not think!'' The 
instruction given to evoke silent speech--``think the 
vowel a''--was chosen because it is the first letter 
of the alphabet. Over a period of six months, eight subjects 
were tested in rotation, between 50 and 100 times each, in an 
absolutely silent room. Each subject was seated, as motionless 
as possible, facing a screen equipped with two intermittently 
operative light-emitting diodes, one red and one green. A point 
situated between the two diodes helped to fix the subject's 
gaze. ``Throughout each experiment, it was necessary to avoid 
any and all spontaneous movement, which would inevitably have 
been translated into an emission of parasitic cerebral electric 
waves. The gaze fixing point proved insufficient, and the 
subjects had to be fitted with a kind of yoke to immobilize 
their head. All swallowing or any other movement whatever of the 
throat muscles was categorically forbidden!'' As for the 
principle of the test, it was utterly simple. The guinea-pig, 
wearing a headdress consisting of a dozen or so electrodes, was 
asked to pronounce the vowel a mentally upon the 
display of a given color. To eliminate the effects of 
anticipation or habit, the significance of the colors was 
reversed several times and the time intervals between displays 
were produced at random. ``We performed some 600 
electroencephalographic measurements in all. Regardless of the 
mental response called for (think a or do not think 
a), a cerebral reaction was observed at the rear of 
the brain, in all cases, 0.3 second after the lighting of the 
diode. This reaction is altogether logical, in that this part of 
the brain encloses the center of vision. On the other hand, and 
this is the important thing, this wave was detected 0.42 second 
later in the frontal part, which lodges the centers of action, 
solely in the cases when the subject was asked to produce 
silent speech.'' In other words, each time the 
subject thought a, the Japanese researchers were able 
to detect an electric wave sweeping the cortex from back to 
front. And by statistical treatment of the 600 measurements 
taken, they were able to characterize the intensity of this 
wave. ``The large number of tests run enabled us to discard 
parasitic noises and to delimit a relatively powerful wave in 
the frontal region, whose negative potential ranged around an 
average value of -4.25 microvolts. Its duration varied between 
0.4 and 1.2 second, depending on the subjects. It appeared in 
the midst of a myriad of small positive and negative waves, of 
much shorter duration, which can be considered the cerebral 
waves responsible for vision.'' A wave resembling that of the 
thought a was also detected when Norio Fujimaki asked 
the subjects to actually pronounce the letter a. This 
is equivalent to saying that, from the standpoint of cerebral 
activity, there is practically no difference between thinking 
and pronouncing. Only the will--whose location no one has yet 
succeeded in pinpointing!-would appear to intervene to prevent 
us from proceeding from the thought to the action. Does one not 
sometimes go off to talk all alone when immersed in deep 
meditation, oblivious to the environment? 
  Norio Fujimaki would like to go further into the tracking of 
the brain's thought waves, with magnetoencephalography (MEG). 
This technique measures the modulations of the magnetic field of 
extremely low intensity emitted by the brain's activity. Its 
intensity is of the order of one millionth that of the earth's 
magnetic field! The method enables the pinpointing of neuronal 
reactions with a precision of two millimeters over a time lapse 
of less than a millisecond. For starters, the Japanese 
researcher would be able to track the displacement of the 
thought waves that run through our minds! Another advantage: The 
signals could be captured without necessitating direct contact 
with the head being probed. But this method is still 
experimental and very costly. In particular, it calls for 
magnetic sensors based on superconductors cooled by liquid 
helium.... 
  Spectacular though initial silent speech results 
may seem, numerous questions remain without a clear response for 
the moment, indeed without a response at all! For example: Were 
any letters other than a tested? And why not entire 
words? How can one be certain that the subjects thought 
a and not something else? ``Actually, other 
experiments were conducted, but I cannot yet divulge the 
results. They are discussed in an article that I am in the 
process of submitting to the magazine ELECTRO-ENCEPHALOGRAPHY. 
As regards verifying whether the subjects are actually thinking 
a, I recognize that a certain ambiguity exists on 
this point inasmuch as we have no way of checking the subjects' 
mental discipline,'' Norio Fujimaki acknowledges. He merely 
points out that the bioelectric responses of the subjects as a 
whole exhibit only very slight deviations of around 1 percent. 
Since the subjects did not consult with each other, it may 
reasonably be assumed that they all conformed to the same 
instruction. This said, the Japanese researcher recognizes that 
instead of thinking a he could just as well have 
asked them to concatenate ideas or to evoke a poem in their 
heart of hearts. This amounts to saying that the research 
conducted by Fujitsu, at least in this initial stage, was less 
aimed at recognition of waves representing the thought of a 
specific letter or word than at characterizing a broader mental 
activity, specifically, in this case, the evoking of an interior 
discourse. By being able to discern it in the midst of the 
background noise corresponding to suspended mental activity, 
Fujitsu would already have achieved an initial operable 
distinction of the ``idle''-``not idle'' type. Nothing would 
then prevent the codifying of this binary message, addressed to 
a machine, in terms of yes, no or of plus, 
minus. 
  It remains to be seen whether it will be possible some day, 
one way or another, to decode the content of the thoughts 
passing through our minds. It must be acknowledged that the 
majority of the scientists who have long been doing work on the 
brain view such a quest as utopian. According to them, it is 
highly improbable that each given mental representation 
corresponds to a unique physicochemical state of the brain. On 
this basis, it hardly seems possible to achieve an alphabet, 
whether it consist of electrical, magnetic, or chemical signals, 
by means of which the sense of a thought could be reconstructed. 
``This schema would be far too simplistic and static. 
Present-day imaging techniques, which enable us to grasp a 
little better what is occurring in the human brain as it 
performs its functions, reveal an extremely complex dynamic 
whose rules we are not anywhere near to discerning,'' says 
Bernard Mazoyer, head of the CEA's (Atomic Energy Commission's) 
Neurofunctional Imaging Group at Orsay. Nevertheless, studies 
realized to date on the functioning of the brain have already 
unveiled certain aspects of the mechanism of perception and of 
the nature of conscience. It has been shown, for example, that 
for a given mental operation several areas of the brain, 
including distant ones, are mobilized. By more refined 
observation, it has even been possible to show that all of the 
neurons concerned produce electrical discharges simultaneously 
and at the same frequency, throughout the duration of the 
stimulation. This manner of functioning would explain how we 
become instantly conscious of everything that surrounds us. 
Thus, as soon as we perceive an object, a bottle, for example, 
we immediately have an idea of its shape, its color, its feel, 
its weight, and its volume, even though we may be only seeing a 
part of it. As for knowing the manner in which distant groups of 
neurons communicate with each other in order to synchronize with 
each other... it is a mystery. In any case, it all occurs as if, 
in a fraction of a second, our brain reconstructs a puzzle in 
order to provide us all the information we need to describe or 
manipulate the object perceived. In a given case, it may be a 
matter of grasping the bottle correctly in order to pour out its 
contents for the purpose of drinking them. More intriguing is 
the observation made by neurologist Rodolfo Llinas of the 
University of New York. By means of a magnetoencephalograph--to 
date, he is one of the rare persons to possess one--this 
researcher scrutinized a subject's brain as he asked the subject 
to play mentally with cubes placed before him. The rule was 
simple: Imagine in space the displacement an isolated cube would 
have to undergo in order to fit in with other cubes. Astonished, 
the American professor found that the displacement of activity 
among the neurons described a rotation within the brain 
corresponding to that of the cube! 
  Another imaging technique, positron emission tomography 
[PET], has enabled other astonishing discoveries. In France, 
Bernard Mazoyer and his team use this method on the human brain. 
It is an indirect method of observing neuronal activity by 
measuring the augmentation of blood flows arriving at the cells 
in action. The team has thus been able to display the different 
forms of thought that may traverse the brain! The nerve centers 
mobilized within the brain differ depending on whether an image 
or a movement is represented. It further appears that when one 
thinks of a movement, the motor-neuron zones concerned by the 
movement are also activated. It was possible to observe this 
with respect to eye movement. In Great Britain, a team of 
neurobiologists observed the same phenomenon by asking a group 
of subjects to mentally associate ideas. The motor-neuron zone 
controlling the articulation of language was activated as if 
they were preparing to pronounce words. These recent 
observations thus corroborate Norio Fujimaki's idea according to 
which the boundary between thinking a word and pronouncing it is 
very thin. They should also provide support to Terry Hambrecht 
and William Heetderks. These two American scientists at the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders at Bethesda, 
Maryland, see the day approaching when the degree of disability 
of the severely motor-handicapped can be reduced by means of 
brain implants. The idea, unlike that of Fujitsu's work, is not 
to base the approach on orders emitted by thought itself, but 
rather on signals captured at a lower stage: that of the motor 
neuron centers that command the muscles to execute this or that 
action. ``Inoperative muscles can be short-circuited by 
detouring the information directly to a robotic prosthesis,'' 
said the two Americans last September in OMNI magazine. In a 
way, the bionic human... 
<H5>  [Box p 18]: </H5>
<H5>  Attention! Danger! </H5>
  It has happened before, with the nuclear among others: Every 
discovery has a double cutting edge. So let us imagine that 
Fujitsu's machine has now been developed. To improve it, so that 
it will still better serve our purposes, the engineers will 
undoubtedly rack their brains to teach it to decipher notions of 
greater subtlety than ``plus, minus'' and ``yes, no.'' To begin 
with, the obedient machine could be transformed into an 
implacable interrogator of our most intimate thoughts. Into a 
judge of Truth, if, in the best of cases, this diabolical 
machine were in the hands of Justice. In the worst case, one 
dare not imagine its possible uses... The pilfering of our 
secret gardens. The violation of our psyche. An international 
ethics committee would undoubtedly be formed to circumscribe its 
use to noble ends. But circumventions are always possible, and 
Big Brother is not all that distant. For that matter, even 
before reaching the point of no return, Fujitsu's seemingly 
laudable invention raises several questions. What about human 
operators who, to run these third-generation machines, will have 
to clutter their minds with operational, codified thoughts? A 
way of getting humans to think like the machine. Some progress! 
<H5>  [Box p 21]: </H5>
<H5>  When Fiction Outdoes Reality </H5>
  In 1937, novelist Andre Maurois wrote ``La machine a 
lire les pensees'' [The Thought Reader]. 
  ``(...) A Doctor Max, by placing subjects in insulating, 
coffin-like enclosures, has been able to capture and amplify 
cerebral emissions (...), and I wonder if the image of the brain 
could be captured by some sort of apparatus... - In sum, you 
would like to film dreams?... - Exactly...'' 
  ``Capture and amplify cerebral emissions,'' ``coffin-like 
enclosures''... In describing this scene in 1937, in a 
science-fiction novel, ``La machine a lire les pensees,'' Andre 
Maurois revealed a true visionary mind. His description is the 
very likes of the principle of the magnetoencephalograph, a tool 
that serves today to record the brain's activity! 
  The author goes this principle one better, a few lines 
later, 
describing in detail what present-day imaging techniques have 
only now enabled us to discover: That the mental evocation of a 
word is accompanied by the activation of the motor neuron that 
controls the speaking of the word: 
  ``(...) Thinking man's interior language is a very defined 
physical phenomenon (...). It is translated by movements of the 
tongue and larynx... - Really? I would have thought that the

<H5>  `An Exceptionally Ambitious Project' </H5>
  The reaction of Marc Guilliaume, member of the France 
Telecom's Scientific Council, and professor of applied economics 
at Paris-Dauphine University. 
  The research on ``silent speech'' being pursued by the 
Fujitsu laboratories is exceptionally ambitious and merits our 
full attention in many respects. 
  The methodological and technical difficulties that must be 
surmounted are immense and give the project a science-fiction 
dimension. By permitting the researchers a high degree of 
freedom to explore such bold trails, the Japanese industrialists 
are showing that they can support basic research and long-term 
innovations. 
  This said, what is surprising is the striking contrast 
between the ambitious scope of this research and the modest 
scope of its applications, at least as they have been unveiled 
to date. The control (specifically, voice control) of computers, 
and-more generally, the man-machine interface, have greatly 
advanced over the past several years. 
  The real object of this research is another: It is aimed at 
improved recognition of certain human thought processes. 
Initially, the study of the waves emitted by the brain could 
yield medical and neurolinguistic applications. Just as research 
on data processing of speech opens the way to 
envisioning--beyond initial applications in the area of control 
of automatons--a full-fledged mastery of linguistic 
intelligence, and, for example, automated translation in real 
time. From a more general viewpoint, all research on the 
functioning of the brain can yield a more refined understanding 
of the thought processes, another ``model'' of the human 
intelligence. 
  Indeed, the Fujitsu project appears to extend, quite boldly, 
the recently postulated model of an artificial intelligence 
based on neuronal networks. The performance capabilities of 
conventional computers have become mind-boggling, as much for 
their power as for their speed. They are bringing profound 
changes to the conditioning of writing, reading, storage, and 
communication. They are based, however, on intellectual 
mechanisms to which we therefore cannot attribute the status of 
human or even animal intelligence. We know, for example, that 
the most sophisticated robots are still a long way from 
possessing the learning capabilities that are within the range 
of living organisms endowed with a modest number of neurons 
(machines calculate very well, but are incapable of executing 
the simplest of gestures...). On the other hand, by way of 
simulation, trial and error, and interactive learning, neuronal 
devices are beginning to attain notably better performance 
capabilities. The Fujitsu project evokes dreams of automatons 
equipped with sensors that would learn to simulate certain 
mental processes of the human brain. These SNR [Simulated 
Neuronal Network] automatons would hark back, paradoxically, to 
the historic old tradition of the analog automatons, those that, 
from Abbe Mical to Vaucanson and von Kempelen, simulated the 
human voice, gestures, and appearance. But here, the ultimate 
stage would be the simulation of human thought. 
  The prospectus of an analog intelligence, of a vengeance 
wreaked on today's computers by SNR automatons, is a very 
uncertain one, and in any case goes beyond the already very 
ambitious Fujitsu program. It sees this project as perhaps the 
first step toward the realization of dreams often explored by 
the science-fiction writers: The brain no longer able to ensure 
the inviolability of thought, of one's innermost being, thought 
is recorded and preserved, or restored to the brain that emitted 
it, or transferred to another brain. And thus, ultimately, by 
the end of time, the end of the separation between individual 
consciences, and access to a kind of immortality!

  [Text] The task was straightforward enough to cut a tunnel 
so a pipeline could be laid to connect a rainwater-collection 
pond in a residential area with a nearby pumping station. Just 
the job for shield tunneling equipment. 
  However, there was a snag: the tunnel needed to curve, but 
it 
was passing under a crowded residential area where there was no 
room to dig a vertical shaft to grab in and redirect the cutting 
blades. 
  The answer, thought up by Taisei Corp. engineer Toshihiko 
Bessho, was to redesign the shield machine so it could change 
cutting direction on its own. 
  The world's first spherical shield tunneling machine is 
already at work digging the rainwater pipeline in Kawasaki near 
Tokyo. Taisei is the prime contractor and Ishikawajima-Harima 
Heavy Industries Co. helped in developing the new tunneling 
machine. 
  The biggest advantage of this new shield machine is that it 
can excavate in one direction and then turn 90 degrees to 
excavate in a new direction. A sphere housing an auxiliary 
shield is attached toward the front of the main shield. This 
sphere pivots 90 degrees, at which point the auxiliary shield 
can be separated from the main shield for further excavation 
work. 
<H5>  Globular Thinking </H5>
  ``The construction of a shield that can turn 90 degrees has 
long been a dream of civil engineers,'' says Bessho, manager of 
the technology division in Taisei's Construction Technology 
Development Department. 
  The idea came to Bessho one day while he was staring at a 
golf ball. He suddenly realized that a pivoting sphere could be 
used to freely change the course of excavation. 
  Bessho knew that pivoting the front shield would be 
difficult. His answer was to house a second, smaller auxiliary 
shield on the sphere, and to use this auxiliary shield for 
excavation in the new direction. Of course, this results in a 
tunnel that suddenly changes diameter, ending up larger at one 
end than at the other. But while this would be a complication 
when designing, say, an underground train line, it is not a 
problem for water lines. 
  For the Kawasaki project, Taisei is using a tunneling 
machine 
with a front shield diameter of 5.5 meters, and an auxiliary 
shield diameter of 3.6 meters. 
  Using conventional shield tunneling equipment, there are two 
ways to excavate a curve. The usual solution is to gradually 
turn the shield, drawing a large arc. But to accomplish this, it 
is necessary to stabilize the ground, which significantly boosts 
construction costs. An alternative method is to excavate a 
vertical hole, lift the shield up with a crane and turn it 90 
degrees. But vertical excavation is itself a major operation, 
with its own attendant difficulties. 
  Taisei decided to use the spherical shield in the Kawasaki 
project because the tunnel needed to be dug in a densely 
populated residential area with narrow streets. 
  At &yen;600 million ($5.40 million), the spherical shield is 
much more expensive than conventional shields. However, it 
eliminates the need to stabilize the surrounding earth, which in 
the case of the Kawasaki project would have cost several hundred 
million yen. 
  Moreover, Taisei figured that continuous excavation with the 
spherical shield would reduce construction time by as much as 
six months. Taisei's calculations indicated that the project 
would cost a total of &yen;1.8 billion using conventional 
construction procedures, but only &yen;1.5 billion with the 
spherical shield, for savings of 17%. 
  Development of this spherical shield opens up a new era in 
tunnel construction. Taisei's goal is to develop a tunneling 
machine that can turn freely and be used in deep underground 
digging projects.

  [Text] From FY94, MITI will begin developing technologies 
to store carbon gas (CO[.sup]2[/]) in the ocean as part of 
its plan to develop technologies for fixing and effective use of 
CO[.sup]2[/]. This will entail liquefying CO[.sub]2[/] by 
using water pressure in the deep seas, then using the property 
of being heavier than water to store it in the ocean. This will 
be an 8-year project with about &yen;6 billion in funding. The 
project will begin with demonstration testing in an experimental 
pool and ultimately, the CO[.sup]2[/]will be transported from 
power plants by pipeline or tanker and stored in large volume in 
deep seas over 3,700 meters (m) deep. In the past, the 
mainstream of CO[.sup]2[/] fixing technology was in 
biotechnology, for effective uses such as the production of 
activated physiological substances, but the same technology will 
make large-volume processing of CO[.sup]2[/] possible. 
  In the preliminary survey stage, it was found that 
CO[.sup]2[/] becomes liquid under the pressure of water at 
depths of over 3,700m. Thus the focus of future technological 
development surveys will be on how to apply pressure to the gas, 
which will be transported by pipeline or tanker, and convey it 
to deep-sea areas, and how CO[.sup]2[/] behaves in the ocean. 
  It also is said that liquefied CO[.sup]2[/] reacts with 
water in the ocean and forms a film called ``CO[.sup]2[/] 
hydrate,'' which will act as a barrier to diffusion. The chief 
project implementer will be decided by the New Energy and 
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) by public 
subscription. The Research Institute of Innovative Technologies 
for the Earth (RITE) has been cited as a likely candidate. 
  CO[.sup]2[/] fixing also has been mentioned as a theme for 
international development of energy and environmental 
technologies because of its urgency in connection with the 
framework treaty on climate change, which is scheduled to become 
effective at the beginning of 1994. The goal of the treaty is to 
stabilize the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] emission to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000. MITI wants to realize large-volume processing 
of CO[.sup]2[/] by attaining practical application of this 
technology.

  [Text] From FY94, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will 
begin developing technologies to convert diesel trucks, which 
belch black smoke and nitrogen oxides (NO[.sup]x[/]) as they 
run, into clean natural gas (CNG) trucks. This is a unique 
effort seen nowhere else in the world, and since natural gas is 
an abundant resource, achieving practical use of natural gas 
trucks will help conserve the environment and stimulate the use 
of alternative energies. 
  NO[.sup]x[/] and black smoke emitted by diesel trucks are 
causes of air pollution in large cities. To suppress the 
emission of such pollutants, MOT is trying to convert 
medium-size diesel trucks to use clean, abundant natural gas for 
fuel. That is, diesel trucks running on the roads now will be 
transformed into natural gas trucks that will be kind to the 
environment. 
  Compared to gasoline, natural gas emits less NO[.sup]x[/] 
and black smoke. The reason practical use of natural gas trucks 
has been slow is that natural gas is difficult to ignite; it is 
stable and difficult to burn. A characteristic of the diesel 
engine is that fuel is compressed, which causes self-ignition. 
Self-ignition of natural gas is difficult, however. Thus the 
idea of initially burning gasoline to assist ignition is being 
considered. Fuel compression ratio is expected to be about 16. 
Eventually, this will be replaced by an engine in which ignition 
of natural gas by itself will be possible. 
  Additionally, because natural gas vehicles emit a 
substantial 
amount of methane, an unburned substance that causes global 
warming, a catalyst that will eliminate methane must be 
attached. MOT's research organization, the Traffic Safety and 
Pollution Research Institute, will develop an oxide catalyst or 
catalytic converter rhodium (CCRO) with strong methane clean-up 
capability and will establish operating standards. 
  With the establishment of these technologies, diesel trucks 
will be reborn as natural gas trucks that will be kind to the 
environment and that will promote the use of alternative 
energies. 
  MOT plans to use funds from the Environment Agency's budget 
to complete a series of research by FY97.

  [Text] The Japan Gas Association, Inc., has released the 
interim report of the ``survey and research group on desert 
greening technology as a CO[.sup]2[/] countermeasure'' 
(chaired by Tokyo University Professor Yoichi Kaya), which was 
formed in September 1992. The report states: 
  (1) The global amount of CO[.sup]2[/] released during use 
of fossil fuels is estimated to be 6 billion tons per year, and 
to be effective, a minimum of 100 million tons per year must be 
fixed, which requires 100 square kilometers (sqm) of 
afforestation; 
  (2) to be effective, CO[.sup]2[/] fixing must be 
continuous over a long period (100 years) by trees that have 
been planted, and R&amp;D on the lifestyle, industries and social 
systems of the implementing regions are needed along with 
research on afforestation and greening technologies. 
  Until now, research on desert greening was mainly elemental 
research, such as on agricultural technology and grassland for 
pastures, but the unique feature of research by Japan Gas 
Association's research group is the regarding of desert greening 
as a CO[.sup]2[/] countermeasure and the approach of 
integrating all the sectors. 
  As a result of research thus far, the following four 
proposals have been made: 
  (1) Over 100 sqm afforestation is needed; 
  (2) CO[.sup]2[/] fixing must continue for 100 years; 
  (3) long-term evaluation of a macro-balance is needed that 
takes into account not only the amount of CO[.sup]2[/] fixed 
in forests but also the CO[.sup]2[/] generated by sustained 
afforestation; 
  (4) the many diverse types of deserts should be ranked by 
the 
needed afforestation technologies, and the best technologies 
should be applied. 
  In the future, climate improvement technologies, 
technologies 
for effective use of water, and rainy season-based afforestation 
technologies will be studied with emphasis on effective 
supplying and use of water resources in the desert. In addition, 
quantitative evaluation of the amount of CO[.sup]2[/] fixed 
will be carried out and scenarios for desert greening projects 
will be drawn up as a compilation of research. 
  The Japan Gas Association established this research group 
jointly with the Research Institute of Innovative Technologies 
for the Earth (RITE), and has provided &yen;5 million per year 
in funding.

  [Text] By using a newly developed absorber liquid, the 
Kansai Electric Power Company has succeeded in reducing by about 
20% the energy required to separate and recover CO[.sup]2[/] 
from thermal power plant exhaust gas. This reduces the cost of 
separation and recovery, and is another step toward practical 
application. Kansai Electric screened over 200 types of absorber 
liquids, conducted tests on about 40 types, then developed an 
absorber liquid that requires little energy. Until now, 900 
kilocalories were needed to recover 1 kilogram (kg) of 
CO[.sup]2[/], but 700 kilocalories is enough with the newly 
developed absorber liquid. The absorber liquid is 
alkanol-amin-based. The required energy is expected to be even 
less if the absorber liquid is heated by steam bleeding from the 
steam turbine, and Kansai Electric will continue to concentrate 
on developing technology for separation and recovery of 
CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas. 
  Kansai Electric has carried out research on a chemical 
absorption method as a technology to separate and recover 
CO[.sup]2[/] for use in thermal power plants because this 
method facilitates capacity expansion. In 1990, small-scale 
basic testing equipment was set up in the Sakai Harbor power 
plant and from April 1991, research using actual exhaust gas was 
carried out at a pilot plant (processes 600 normal cubic meters 
of gas per hour) that was built at the Minami Harbor power 
plant. The pilot plant uses technology introduced from the U.S. 
firm Floa Daniel [phonetic]. Paralleling this, absorber liquid 
screening tests were carried out at the technology research 
institute. 
  In the past, it took 900 kilocalories to separate and 
recover 
1 kg of CO[.sup]2[/] from exhaust gas. This is about 20% of 
boiler heat input. With the newly developed absorber liquid, 700 
kilocalories is sufficient, and the percentage of boiler heat 
input also drops to about 15%. 
  Even greater conservation of energy can be realized by using 
steam bleeding from the steam turbine to heat the absorber 
liquid. 
  CO[.sup]2[/] separation and recovery by the chemical 
absorption method entails absorption of CO[.sup]2[/], which 
comprises about 9% of exhaust gas, into a liquid in an 
absorption tower, then heating the liquid in a regeneration 
tower, which releases the CO[.sup]2[/]. Absorber liquid that 
absorbs CO[.sup]2[/] well and has little heat of reaction is 
sought. Kansai Electric has experimented with various types of 
absorber liquids, testing for absorption rate, heat of reaction, 
corrosion and degradation. The new absorber liquid reduces 
separation and recovery energy, which also lessens the 
percentage of power generation cost taken up by the cost of 
CO[.sup]2[/] recovery.

  [Text] On 24 November, NEC Corporation announced that it 
had succeeded in developing new, advanced technology for 
processing waste water that contains fluorine, in which the 
amount of sludge generated during the processing will be reduced 
to 1/30th that of existing coagulation methods. NEC will build a 
pilot plant soon, and will try to achieve practical application 
in 1 to 2 years at semiconductor plants, etc. This is expected 
to contribute greatly to reducing the rapidly increasing cost of 
sludge processing. 
  The recently developed technology entails repeated use of 
aluminum hydroxide in gel form as an adsorbent to process 
fluorine waste water. This makes it possible to drastically 
reduce the concentration of the fluorine waste water without 
generating coagulating sedimentation sludge. The technology uses 
the solubility of aluminum hydroxide in gel form, which causes 
transformation, and fluorine adsorptivity PH (an index that 
shows concentration of hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution; PH7 
is neutral, with smaller values indicating stronger acidity and 
higher values indicating stronger alkalinity). 
  The fluorine waste water processing method generally used at 
this time is a coagulation method in which calcium chloride is 
added to the fluorine waste water to fix most of the fluorine 
into refractory fluoro-calcium, then as advanced processing, a 
large quantity of sulfate band or other coagulant is added to 
form a coagulating sediment, with which the remaining fluorine 
is incorporated and coprecipitated. 
  NEC, observed that although aluminum hydroxide in gel form 
had high fluorine adsorptivity when close to neutral, this 
dropped abruptly when it became alkaline. Thus it proceeded with 
research based on the assumption that low-cost, advanced 
processing of fluorine waste water without creating coagulating 
sedimentation sludge was possible if adsorbed fluorine could be 
desorbed and recovered efficiently. As a result, NEC succeeded 
in developing technology to desorb adsorbed fluorine through PH 
manipulation, as follows: ``Aluminum hydroxide in gel form at 
the stable level of PH7 caused fluorine adsorption. At PH9, 
calcium chloride was added to desorb the adsorbed fluorine into 
fluoro-calcium. Then at PH11, when the aluminum hydroxide was 
dissolved completely, the fluoro-calcium was filtered out and 
the filtrate was returned to PH7 to regenerate aluminum 
hydroxide in gel form.'' 
  The conclusions from the above are as follows: 
  (1) Aluminum hydroxide in gel form used as a fluorine 
adsorbent is not discharged outside the element, so the amount 
of sludge is about 1/30th the amount created by the coagulation 
method; 
  (2) the processing efficiency of aluminum hydroxide is over 
10 times that of other fluorine adsorbents because its adsorbing 
area is large; 
  (3) aluminum hydroxide in gel form can be formed by 
neutralizing inexpensive aluminum chloride, so the cost is low, 
under 1/10; 
  (4) no special adsorption preprocessing is required, so 
equipment cost is low because about 20% addition to 
existing 
equipment will be sufficient.

  [Text] A solar power generation system (see photo 
[omitted]) that the New Energy and Industrial Technology 
Development Organization (NEDO) was building with the Ministry 
of Energy, Posts and Telecommunications of Malaysia in Sabah 
State in the northern part of Kalimantan Island has been 
completed and experiments will begin this month. The efficiency 
of conversion from light energy to electric energy by solar 
cells drops when temperature rises, so experiments will be 
carried out to search for an effective way to cool solar cells 
in Malaysia, where high temperatures prevail. 
  The system is composed of monocrystalline solar cells with 
10 
kilowatt (kw) output, 136 kw hour (kwh) storage batteries, and 
data collection equipment. Experiments will be conducted with 
several types of natural cooling and forced cooling methods. 
  In experiments with natural cooling, modules of multiple 
solar cells mounted on a single board will be placed on water or 
separated from the ground surface; and various angles of 
inclination will be tried. In experiments with forced cooling, 
the surface of the modules will be sprayed with water or air 
will be blown from the back of the modules. 
  A 100 kw output system will be built in FY95 in order to 
switch to large-scale research. NEDO's share of the cost is 
about &yen;600 million.

  [Text] Close your eyes and hold something between your 
fingers. The tactile feedback you get lets you adjust your grip 
to the resilience of the object. A rock you can really grab, 
while a cotton ball you need to nab gingerly so it doesn't get 
crushed. 
  A human's tactile system is sensitive enough to deal with 
most objects, but for something really small, say a millimeter 
in size, feedback is lacking and we have no control. This poses 
a problem for engineers designing tools for precision 
manipulation, like during microsurgery or during the handling of 
individual cells in a biotechnology lab. 
  A group at Tokyo's Hosei University has developed a 
master-slave robot hand designed to overcome this problem. Its 
prototype consists of a V-shaped master control shaped like a 
grip strengthener, and a slave hand shaped like a set of 
pincers. When the user grips the control, the pincers close to 
grasp a small object. At the same time, a strain gauge built 
into the pincers conveys information back about the resilience 
of the object. 
  Through a computer interface, the resilience of the V-shaped 
handle is changed so the user can ``sense'' that the object has 
been grasped and can adjust the amount of force applied. 
  The prototype manipulator is 10cm long. In tests, users were 
able to grasp objects ranging in size from 15mm to 2mm, and they 
were also able to discriminate differences in softness between 
objects of the same size. 
  The group aims to combine the robot hand with a manipulator 
table and a microscope in order to develop a tool which can be 
used to grasp microorganisms and other small objects.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] We interviewed director of Electrotechnical Lab 
(RTL) and the top executives of 12 Japanese manufacturers, each 
heading the company's R&amp;D division, concerning major 
achievements for 1993, R&amp;D themes to be pursued for 1994, and 
comparison of the U.S. and Japanese R&amp;D efforts. All makers 
listed a ``multimedia-related area'' as a research theme to be 
pursued. More specifically, the majority of the makers selected 
an area related to image processing technology as their 1994 
research theme. The number of makers who will pursue 
``environment/energy-related'' theme has increased. As for their 
achievements, emphasis was on product development and practical 
application of technologies. Results in basic research were few 
and far in between. 
  A chorus of many voices. Shift in research themes during the 
past 3 years is manifested in a sudden increase in the number of 
multimedia-related R&amp;D projects undertaken. In contrast, only 
one company pursued HDTV R&amp;D in 1993. 
  The questions put to top R&amp;D executives are as follows: 
<H5>  A. R&amp;D Results and R&amp;D Policy </H5>
  (A-1) Please list approximately five of your main R&amp;D 
achievements for 1993. 
  (A-2) Please list approximately five of your main R&amp;D 
themes 
for 1994 projects. 
  (A-3) Please tell us shift in your R&amp;D investment for 
the 
past 20 years. 
<H5>  B. R&amp;D in Recessionary Times </H5>
  (B-a) The trend appears to indicate Japanese electronics 
makers are cutting back their investments. Is this true of your 
company? If the economic condition is such that your company has 
no choice but to cut back R&amp;D investments, how will you 
change 
your R&amp;D policy? What sort of measure will you take so that 
your 
company's technical performance will not suffer from investment 
cutbacks? 
<H5>  C. Comparison between U.S. and Japanese R&amp;D </H5>
  (C-1) Do you think the U.S. manufacturing industries, having 
overcome the recession and now well on the way to full recovery, 
are stronger than before in the manufacturing field? How are 
they doing in the R&amp;D field? What makes you think so? How 
will 
they change in the future? 
  (C-2) Where do you think the strength of Japanese 
manufacturing industries lie? What about the U.S. industries? 
What are the factors attributable to those differences? 
  (C-3) In which field and under what kind of conditions each 
country's system works most effectively? 
  (C-4) Generally speaking, which field and themes should 
Japanese electronics makers focus their attention? In your 
opinion, which field and themes are considered important by 
American manufacturers? 
<H5>  Hitachi, Ltd. - Mr. Yasushi Takeda, Managing Director. </H5>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Wide-band region ISDN ATM exchange system; 
  (2) Super computer ``HITAC S-3800 system''; 
  (3) High-speed and large-volume ``Creative Station 3000 
Facsimile Series''; 
  (4) Single chip RISC microcomputer ``SH series''; 
  (5) Single electron memory; 
  (6) Total automatic washer ``Crisp and Dry,'' with a faster 
hydroextractor rotational speed. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Information transmission systems, such as wide-band ISDN 
and mobile communication systems; 
  (2) Large-scale rail travel management system; 
  (3) Medical electronics which takes into consideration aging 
society; 
  (4) Multimedia workstation system; 
  (5) Information recording technology and high-density 
opto-magnetic large memory recording technology. 
<H3>  Building up R&amp;D Center To Achieve High Speed in Product 
Development </H3>
  From technical standpoint, American manufacturers are 
substantially ahead of the rest of the world in the software 
field. Japanese manufacturers, on the other hand, possesses 
well-balanced technologies, beginning with R&amp;D and ending 
with 
manufacturing. I believe that Japanese culture should be 
reflected on software technology as well. We should work on the 
kind of software which is uniquely Oriental in its approach. The 
automatic distribution system currently under development at 
Hitachi exemplifies this. It is being used in railway 
operational control. 
  What we should learn from the United States is a significant 
role played by American universities in R&amp;D. Japanese 
R&amp;D relies 
too much on private industries. Our universities have only a 
feeble role to play in this respect. If Japan is to assert 
itself as a country founded on science and technology, our 
government should invest to strengthen academic research 
environment. In the United States, since the industry's vision 
tends to be short-ranged, universities are called in to provide 
a long-range vision. Japanese industries' approach, on the other 
hand, is based on a long-range vision. For this reason, it is 
important for Japanese companies to exercise well-balanced 
judgement in allocating research resources. 
  I want to see more effective use of our R&amp;D resources. 
We 
should not be boasting a huge amount spent in investing in 
R&amp;D. 
I feel that R&amp;D and product development are two entirely 
different activities. R&amp;D constitutes ``a total business 
innovation'', while product development constitutes a segment of 
our enterprise division's total activities. In order to 
construct an efficient product development system, we are 
expanding a ``development center'' as a nucleus of this system, 
covering an entire operation of the company. At present, we have 
11 such centers. These serve as a nucleus of the development of 
``strategic enterprise project'' which began in 1992. The 
centers are supported by our research laboratories. 
  Personnel of each development center is drawn from the 
enterprise division and the research laboratory, each unit 
contributing 50%. In carrying out R&amp;D, different 
types of 
expertise brought by these two units are integrated to 
accelerate the pace of research. 
  These activities may give the impression that the company is 
shifting to product development, but I wish to emphasize that we 
are pursuing basic research at the same time. The problem facing 
us now is how we can revitalize product development without 
sacrificing basic research. 
<H5>  Aiming at ``Intelligence and Ecology'' </H5>
  The ``intelligent and ecological society'' is a direction 
toward which Japanese electronics makers are moving. They are 
contributing to the technical fields aimed at achieving advanced 
information society and environmental protection. I feel that 
networking technology, including radio transmission, will be 
crucial to achievement of this goal. 
<H3>  Toshiba - Mr. Seiichi Takayanagi, Representative Executive 
Officer-Vice President. </H3>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993 
  (1) Development of 256M bit DRAM cell in connection with the 
international project; 
  (2) TFT liquid crystal display with high aperture ratio and 
low voltage drive; 
  (3) Image compression technology (MPEG2 decoded LSI); 
  (4) Pen-input portable information device ``Xtend''; 
  (5) A total-body-length X-ray CT equipment using continuous 
helical scanning method; 
  (6) High thermal resistant organic material achieved by 
using 
molecular design. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994 
  (1) Basic next generation semiconductor technology; 
  (2) Digital media network system element technology; 
  (3) Human interface technology; 
  (4) Partial engineering technology (including CAD and other 
types of simulations technologies); 
  (5) High-performance secondary battery; 
  (6) High pressure-resistant and large-volume thyristor for 
transmission of direct current. 
<H3>  When Japan Turned Its Attention to Basic Research, U.S.'s 
Major Effort Shifted to Application Technology </H3>
  The ratio of R&amp;D spending to sales since 1991 for the 
most 
part has remained the same. We did not cut back. However, the 
recessionary economy severely affected market growth, with our 
sales curve remaining flat. Consequently, Toshiba's R&amp;D 
projects, more than ever, are becoming market oriented. 
  Although we tend to treat research and development as one 
activity, in fact they are two activities requiring different 
handling. With research, we use a strict process of selecting 
themes, fully taking into consideration technological trends and 
future of our company's business. This is the policy to which we 
have adhered throughout the past 20 or more years and which we 
have no intention of changing even under recessionary economic 
conditions. 
  Probably I am correct in saying that the U.S. manufacturing 
industry appears to be gaining strength. Efforts put in in 
improving its manufacturing technology and production method are 
now producing results. 
  I also noted change in their approach to R&amp;D which 
began to 
emerge a few years ago. At the time when Japan was crying for 
basic research, the United States already had shifted its 
attention to application-oriented research. In the past, the 
United States was pursuing R&amp;D using the concept of a 
``linear 
model.'' It began with research, which later would be linked to 
development, production, and marketing. What the U.S. industry 
has done is to interlock into this ``linear model'' a ``chaining 
model,'' designed to feedback marketing results into research. 
The U.S. industry, thus, shifted its orientation to application. 
  Our company has adopted a ``3-layered structure,'' linking 
the main office research laboratory, works laboratories, and the 
enterprise division. Because of active interchanges taking place 
between the main research laboratory and enterprise division, 
our company's style can be described as the chaining model. 
<H5>  Basic Research in Software Constitute Search for Concept </H5>
  However, although the three-layer structured system is 
suitable for R&amp;D of hardware technology, it does not work 
well 
with that of software. 
  The purpose of basic research in software is to work out a 
new concept. It is difficult for a large company to have a group 
of researchers with this type of talent. This is not limited 
only to Japan. In the United States, also, very few new concepts 
are emerging from large corporate laboratories. 
  Venture business probably is the only one which has this 
capability. The reason why a venture business can be easily 
established in the United States is that the software field is 
one of very few fields in which an ``American dream'' can be 
realized. Highly gifted researchers bury themselves in pursuit 
of a new concept, paying little attention to daily routines, 
such as eating and sleeping, and practically living on bread and 
water. It will be difficult to create such an environment, 
including a pay structure, within a large corporation. 
<H3>  Mitsubishi Electric - Mr. Eiichi Ohno, Managing Director and 
Head of Development Headquarters. </H3>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Development of a small synchrotron light emission device 
using a superconductive magnet; 
  (2) Development of a high-speed elevator (Landmark Tower in 
Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture); 
  (3) Development of a refrigerator which does not use CFC; 
  (4) Development of a thin film polycrystalline Si solar 
battery; 
  (5) Development of a DINOR type flash memory; 
  (6) Development of a client/server system for use in basic 
tasks. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Development of the next generation of LSI (0.25 
micron-scale miniaturized processing technology); 
  (2) Multimedia-related application technology; 
  (3) Development of a wide-band region ISDN equipment and 
mobile communication equipment; 
  (4) Technology designed to solve energy and environmental 
problems; 
  (5) Social system technology (a road traffic system and a 
total system for a building) 
<H3>  Evaluation of R&amp;D Using Criteria on Whether It Leads to 
New 
Product </H3>
  Since 1990, the amount of investment made by Mitsubishi has 
remained approximately 7% of the company's annual sales. 
This 
situation probably will continue at least for the next two to 
three years. 
  Faced with this situation, effectiveness of R&amp;D becomes 
primary importance. What we mean by ``effectiveness'' in this 
context is whether a given R&amp;D will lead to a new product. 
If it 
leads to a product, its effectiveness is high and therefore is 
evaluated as a success. If it does not lead to product, then it 
is viewed as a failure. In order to enhance effectiveness, it is 
necessary to apply strict criteria in selecting R&amp;D themes. 
In 
making investment, the company will focus its attention on the 
importance of R&amp;D themes and make investment decisions 
accordingly. 
  Based on this approach, the company restructured its R&amp;D 
organizations in June 1993. Several research laboratories 
located at the development headquarters have been moved to the 
enterprise headquarters. The enterprise headquarters is now 
responsible for determining R&amp;D themes. Overall adjustments 
of 
themes will be carried out by the development headquarters. 
<H3>  Elimination of Waste by Transferring Authorities through 
Reorganization </H3>
  The reorganization we have undertaken is not a short-term 
change but rather is designed to solve the type of problems 
peculiar to the R&amp;D setup of general electric manufacturers. 
  The scope of general electric manufacturing business is 
expanding, more widely than we have ever imagined possible. In 
order to deal with this, from the 1970s to 1980s, our company 
had established one research laboratory after another at the 
development headquarters. Until recently, we had emphasized 
centralization for the sake of efficiency. We began to realize, 
however, that such a decision-making process as selection of 
themes, to be handled by the development headquarters alone was 
to limit ourselves. 
  We had, therefore, decided to move, whenever possible, 
research laboratories which are working on themes closely linked 
to commercial undertakings to our enterprise headquarters. Only 
those types of researches which are not extensions of existing 
research remain with the development headquarters. For instance, 
in the semiconductor field, both LSI and optic-microwave device 
research laboratories, as well as Custom LSI Design Technology 
Development Center, have been placed under a newly-established 
semiconductor enterprise headquarters. At the development 
headquarters, a semiconductor basic research laboratory which 
emphasizes basic technology has been installed. Research in the 
small synchrotron radiation device, listed as one of our 1993 
achievements, will be continued at the semiconductor basic 
research laboratory. 
  There are disadvantages associated with the decentralization 
of this type. It becomes difficult to share research results 
among the laboratories. In order to prevent this, the 
development headquarters serves as an intermediary between 
research laboratories belonging to the enterprise headquarters. 
<H5>  NEC - Mr. Yasuo Kato, Managing Director. </H5>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) ATMLAN product development and multimedia communication 
system development; 
  (2) Development of parallel computer products; 
  (3) Product development of a high-precision thin liquid 
crystal projection display for use with workstations; 
  (4) RISC multiprocessor core with an operating frequency of 
500MHz; 
  (5) PC voice input/output system product development; 
  (6) Development of metal-containing carbon nanotube. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Hypermedia information transmission system with a high 
degree of speed and freedom; 
  (2) Superparallel/superdistribution processor and its 
software; 
  (3) Intelligent man-machine interface technology; 
  (4) High-precision picture/image technology; 
  (5) The 1 micron-width level microprocessing; 
  (6) Environmentally-sound technology for product 
manufacture. 
<H3>  Laboratory-Nurtured Technology Now Linked to Products with 
More Definite Purpose </H3>
  Of the 1993 R&amp;D expenditure, approximately 10% 
is allocated 
to research laboratories, with the remainder going to the 
enterprise division's R&amp;D section. The investment in the 
enterprise division for 1993 was reduced by &yen;10 billion over 
the 1992 figure. We also held down the costs of software 
development which the research laboratories and enterprise 
division's R&amp;D section ordered from the outside source. 
  We are going to maintain basic research no matter how 
difficult this may become. We will not concentrate our 
investment only in the field where our company's technical 
capabilities excel. Our R&amp;D spending has been reduced over 
the 
past two consecutive years. No further cutbacks, however, will 
be forthcoming. At this juncture, it appears that 1994 will see 
a turnaround, or at least it is expected to be a better year 
than 1993. 
  It is worthwhile to note that our research efforts in 1993 
produced four practical technologies, something which we 
normally do not see. In order to overcome the declining business 
afflicting the entire company, we directed our R&amp;D efforts to 
link the technologies nurtured at the research laboratories to 
product development. 
  We also changed our research management system. Goals, 
investment targets, and R&amp;D schedules have been more clearly 
defined. In the past, research laboratories' projects, in some 
instances, were carried out on a voluntary basis by those 
involved in the field. We have changed this by providing a 
project leader with a clear-cut authority. 
  Moreover, we adopted a system whereby individual researchers 
can select working hours which best suit them. They will be 
evaluated not by the hours they put in but rather by the results 
produced. 
<H3>  We Have No Technology Which Can be Left to Other Companies 
To Develop </H3>
  It is not our understanding that the U.S. companies have 
been 
weakened. For instance, in terms of the electronics industry, 
Japanese industry still has some distance to go before it can 
catch up with the U.S. The United States had been strong in the 
electronics field, and it will continue to be so. However, we do 
not believe that there is little hope for the Japanese industry. 
At least partially, we should see the emergence of a field in 
which the U.S. industry will embrace our ideas and follow our 
steps. 
  In the multimedia field, an R&amp;D joint venture involving 
Japanese and U.S. companies is in progress. Insofar as the field 
in which NEC is involved is concerned, we do not see any 
technology which we must rely on expertise of other companies. 
The reason for this is that, unlike other domestic general 
electric manufacturers, our company has not ventured into 
various other areas. 
  The purpose of our joint undertaking with other companies is 
simply to share technical concept and architecture and not to 
acquire technologies from other companies. 
<H3>  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. - Mr. Shiro Horiuchi, 
Managing Director </H3>
  Main R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) A 98mm-thick television image receiver using a flat CRT; 
  (2) Development of a blue-green semiconductor laser which 
oscillates at room temperatures; 
  (3) Development of a 3-D measurement technique which can 
handle an object measuring as little as 0.01 micron without 
touching it; 
  (4) Development of a quantized neural-network technology and 
neuro chips; 
  (5) Product development of a home raw garbage dehydrator. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Application development of neural network technology; 
  (2) Development of LSI with the minimum processing size of 
0.35 microns; 
  (3) Development of energy-related technology focusing on 
cells and motors; 
  (4) Development of HDTV digital-signal-processing 
technology; 
  (5) Development of information appliance related technology. 
<H3>  To Construct Designs Linking Research Results Quickly to 
Profit </H3>
  The United States is much better at producing a new 
technological idea, while Japan is superior at manufacturing. 
Japan's real strength is the ability to make things with 
accuracy. 
  When the value of the Japanese yen continues to remain high, 
if we are to remain competitive price-wise, we have no 
alternative but to move our production base to overseas. Soon, 
we will have to face the problem of deindustrialization which 
once plagued the U.S. industries. The question of how Japanese 
industries should reconstruct their strength if this should 
occur is the problem with which we all will have to wrestle in 
the near future. 
  Our R&amp;D investment for 1994 falls short of the 1993 
level. 
Unlike equipment and plant investment, R&amp;D is one of the 
divisions given a preferential treatment investment-wise. 
However, the R&amp;D Division no longer can expect the company to 
continue increasing the amount of R&amp;D budget annually as a 
matter of course. 
  Since R&amp;D is a segment of the company's investment 
cycle, it 
must be linked to profit. Only after a result of our research 
produces business profits, can we say that R&amp;D has completed 
a 
cycle. 
  We must, therefore, create a setup whereby results of 
R&amp;D is 
turned into business profits quickly. Our R&amp;D division and 
enterprise department hold a meeting regularly so that the two 
can jointly pursue the project at an earlier stage than has been 
done previously. This will shorten the time required for the 
R&amp;D 
division to deliver the result of its research to the enterprise 
department. Previously, the division did not get together with 
the enterprise department until its research had been almost 
completed. 
<H5>  Undertaking Development of Electric Vehicle Motor </H5>
  Matsushita will intensify its effort to develop such 
energy-related technologies as batteries. Our R&amp;D division 
more 
than ever is aware of the importance of environmental protection 
problems. Development of an electric vehicle motor is our 
energy-saving technology project which will be undertaken soon. 
We have a strong battery technology, and already an inquiry 
regarding our battery technology has been received from a 
manufacturer handling electric vehicles. In order to develop 
superior batteries, development of a motor which drives battery 
should be undertaken simultaneously. 
  The field of home information electronics still remains 
nebulous. We want to develop as many related technologies as 
possible, an example of which is a manufacturing technology 
designed to make electronic products thin and compact. 
<H3>  Fujitsu - Mr. Mikio Otsuki, Representative Managing Director 
and Vice President; and Representative Managing Director and 
President, Fujitsu Laboratories </H3>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Practical ATM exchange and transmission system; 
  (2) Product development of a digital portable phone and an 
elastic wave surface filter; 
  (3) Development of a relational database machine equipped 
with high-speed retrieval functions (100 times the speed of 
existing machine) 
  (4) Super high density external memory device technology (MR 
head technology and opto-magnetic disk device); 
  (5) Completion of 620M bit/second-channel optical parallel 
link module; 
  (6) Product development of 21-inch color plasma displays. 
  1994 R&amp;D Themes: 
  (1) Research in a multimedia system integrated with 
superspeed networks; 
  (2) All-purpose high parallel computer which can deal with 
multimedia; 
  (3) Digital high-quality image processing technology; 
  (4) VLSI technology (64 bits SPARC chip) and new device 
(HEMT); 
  (5) Development of compact portable information equipment 
and 
human interface; 
  (6) Development of middle-ware (intelligent Pad, CASE, 
object-oriented DBMS, etc.) 
<H3>  Research Setup To Anticipate Market Needs and To Transform 
Research Results Quickly into Products </H3>
  R&amp;D spending for 1993 is expected to be &yen;275 
billion, 
which is a decrease of &yen;40 billion over the 1992 figure. 
However, because of the efficient research setup we now have, we 
are able to maintain the same level of result. Through the 
consolidation of the divisions working on overlapping research 
themes and through joint research with other companies, Fujitsu 
company was able to reduce costs and time requirements. 
  Results of joint developments undertaken with British ICL 
and 
PLC, as well as Amdhal in the U.S., have begun to emerge 
finally. They consist of a network management software and 
group-ware. 
  In order to accelerate commercialization of these products, 
it is necessary to change a research setup. With the past setup, 
research began with seeds and only after research was under way, 
it was connected to needs. With our new setup, however, research 
will begin with well-defined needs and determine what technology 
will be required to satisfy those needs. In order to achieve 
this, we developed a measure enabling researchers in different 
fields to work jointly. 
  For instance, in order to catch up with the United States in 
the field of microprocessor research, researchers in 
semiconductor process and system fields will be brought together 
to form a working group. A joint development project involving 
Fujitsu Laboratories and Fujitsu Corporation was undertaken in 
the field of computer peripheral devices for the first time two 
years ago. Four or five projects are currently in progress. 
<H3>  Fujitsu Will Continue its Effort in Multimedia-Related Field 
into 1994 </H3>
  In the software field, Japan has no alternative but to 
accept 
the U.S.-produced operating systems. We should do our utmost to 
develop the middle ware which will play an important role in the 
future. Our company has been selling an object-oriented 
database, ``ODBII'' and a visual type development environment, 
``Intelligent Pad.'' We will aggressively pursue multimedia, 
also. In 1993, Fujitsu established a new multimedia project 
headquarters and a personal system laboratory. 
  Needless to say, basic research will not be neglected 
either. 
We developed a high-speed numerical processing (such as 
factorization) software, the Risal/Asir. At our information 
societal science laboratory, research in genetic algorithms (GA) 
is being conducted. It involves artificial life based on GA, and 
we are investigating the possibility of linking this to human 
interface research. Also under investigation is the linking of 
GA-based optimization to development of software. 
<H5>  Sony - Mr. Minoru Morio, Managing Director and Vice President </H5>
  Main R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Continuous oscillation of blue-green semiconductor laser 
(oscillation wavelength 523 nm) at room temperature; 
  (2) Development of 16M bit SRAM with access time of 9ns; 
  (3) Commercialization of 1/2-inch business-use digital VTR 
``Digital Beta Cam'' designed to record component signals;

<H3>  To Make Most of Each Country's Area of Expertise, System 
Research Assigned to U.S. and Device Research to Japan </H3>
  It has been said that the U.S. manufacturing industry is 
staging a comeback in recent years, or perhaps it may be better 
to say that we are seeing it right now. Intrinsically, there is 
little difference between U.S. and Japanese approaches to 
manufacturing. Most likely, we will continue to compete, 
sometime we will win and at another time we will lose. When 
Japanese manufacturing industry was at its height, the U.S. 
industry learned from it. Now it is Japan's turn to learn from 
the United States. 
<H5>  U.S. Environment Nurtures New Ideas </H5>
  In R&amp;D, also, we have a great deal to learn from the 
United 
States, as we had in the past. It was in the United States where 
new system technologies, such as those in the computer and 
cellular telephone fields, were developed. This situation 
remains unchanged. The Iridium Project is a good example of 
this. With respect to the next generation of television 
broadcasting, a wide variety of proposals, including expansion 
into the areas of ATV and CATB, have been made. 
  The reason why new ideas are generated in succession by the 
United States is that it has a social climate ideal for 
innovation. Its approach toward the administration of regulatory 
controls is a case in point. Japan is a country which regulates 
everything, while the United States's guiding principle is 
freedom. Consequently, if an idea of transmitting TV images over 
telephone circuits is proposed, in the United States, the idea 
can be actually tested. In Japan, on the other hand, the same 
idea can go no further than the proposal as it hits many 
regulatory walls. 
  Another strength of the United States might be that it is a 
country in which researchers and engineers can move from one 
company to another relatively freely. In the United States, a 
researcher can move to a company which is willing to let him 
pursue his interest. Such an environment cannot be created in 
Japan by one company's effort alone. For this reason, I believe 
that our research dealing with the new concept of a fusion of 
communication and computer should be conducted at our U.S.-based 
R&amp;D division. Favorable environment, after all, is essential 
to 
the conceptualization of a new idea. 
  Research in device designed to support such a new system 
will 
be undertaken by our research laboratories in Japan since Japan 
has developed excellent device-related technologies. For 
instance, thanks to the effort of Japanese manufacturers, today, 
semiconductor lasers used in CD players can be manufactured at a 
few hundred yen. 
  I have no intention of carrying this concept of division of 
labor to extremes. Given the present research environment, I 
felt that our U.S. division is best used for conducting 
innovative research and our Japanese division for more 
manufacturing-oriented research. Who knows, in the 21st century, 
their roles may be reversed.

<H3>  Reject ``Jack of All Trades'' Approach to R&amp;D; Selection 
of 
Themes and Concentration of Efforts Important </H3>
  It is important to improve efficiency in carrying out 
R&amp;D in 
recessionary times. The ``jack of all trades'' R&amp;D, having a 
finger in every theme in sight, does not work well. Only by 
selecting a theme carefully and concentrating our effort on it, 
will we be able to succeed. 
  Our handling of a liquid crystal display research is a case 
in point. In order to achieve a flat-panel display, a plasma 
display could also be brought into our project. Our company, 
however, rejected the extension of its effort in that direction. 
  If we have not narrowed down themes properly, however, its 
consequence will have been devastating. Suppose that, of 100 
research themes selected, only three themes were able to produce 
result, the company will have the serious problems of both staff 
morale and business profit at hand. We should aim for a 
100% 
hit in selecting themes. At present, the company relies on top 
executives' judgment in selecting themes. 
<H5>  ``Rush Project'' Which Produced Liquid Crystal VIEWCAM </H5>
  In order to improve R&amp;D efficiency, the company is 
putting 
into practice the following procedures: 
  (1) When selecting a theme, even in the area of basic 
research, we consider the question of how it can be linked to 
our future business undertaking. For instance, in 
superconductive research, we target a high-sensitivity magnetic 
sensor which can be used in medical electronics. We do not 
pursue research in zero-resistant superconductive cables as they 
are not related to our business. 
  (2) In order to bring together our management resources on 
important themes, we introduced a system known as a rush 
project. The rush project is designed to bring together staff 
members working in the related area from all sectors of the 
company to work under a chief assigned to a given R&amp;D 
project. 
The project will deal with an R&amp;D theme, for which all 
element 
technologies are in place and of which future is comparatively 
transparent. It takes one or one and a half years for this type 
of theme to reach a product development stage. Both the ``liquid 
crystal VIEWCAM'' and the ``compact MD (mini disk) Player'' are 
products of the rush project. The projects works so well that 
almost 90% of the products produced by the rush project 
was a 
huge success. 
  (3) In order to utilize test facilities effectively, we 
shortened a core duration of flex time. Although it was 5 hours 
a few years ago, it now has been reduced to 2 hours, from 1:00 
p.m. to 3:00 p.m. If the flex time system is used, we can 
stagger the time for using the facilities. R&amp;D in recent 
years 
uses a large-scale measurement instrument and manufacturing 
equipment, the kind of equipment which the company cannot afford 
to purchase in multiple sets. 
<H3>  Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd. - Mr. Shintaro Ushio, 
Managing Director and Head of R&amp;D Headquarters </H3>

<H3>  From Agrarian to Hunting - Change Demands Researchers' 
Ability to Debate </H3>
  In some fields, Japanese are better at making things than 
Americans. That does not mean, however, that Japanese industries 
are superior to the U.S. industries. Especially in the field of 
software, Japan cannot possibly compete with the United States. 
Consider object-oriented technology, group ware, etc.--they all 
originated in the United States. 
  In our own backyard, Korea is closing in on us. Southeast 
Asian countries also are exerting themselves for manufacturing. 
We can no longer consider the industrial world simply in terms 
of the United States as a thinker and Japan as a maker. Then 
what should Japan do? The answer is Japan must become a thinker 
as well. 
  However, there are cultural differences to consider. For 
instance the United States has a built-in mechanism of debate. 
Its people, therefore, are expected to express their thought. 
The Japanese corporate climate, on the other hand, favors 
suppression of individual thought, as reflected in the saying, 
``A tall tree catches much wind.'' 
  A method employed by Japanese corporations is that of a 
typically agrarian people. They sow seeds and they harvest. Each 
company brings back seeds given by the United States and 
cultivates them in its own field. Intrinsically Japanese are 
different from Americans who are hunters expected to move about 
energetically. 
  It is unreasonable to expect Japanese, who were agrarian 
people by nature even now, to transform themselves to hunters. 
Unless they begin practicing ``javelin throwing'' of hunters, 
how will they possibly be able to create new intelligence? One 
of the methods is to use performance as a basis of a salary 
system; however, this system still is too alien to the Japanese 
corporate culture. Of course, ultimately, as in the United 
States, a contractual base will be adopted. 
  I want researchers to be able to think freely. In terms of 
specialized knowledge, individual researchers are superior to 
managers, as it is the working researchers, and not managers, 
who deal with the substance of research. I want researchers to 
make proposals freely and frequently, paying meticulous 
attention to the quality of their proposed research. As in 
elsewhere, it is important to be discriminating in private 
industries, also. I want them to have dreams and to be able to 
tell me how their potentials can be transformed into practical 
results. I feel that this is the quality which is lacking in 
today's researchers. Most researchers like to talk about 
methodology. ``They can explain to me articulately how they will 
proceed with their research.'' However, they have not given much 
thought to the question of ``for what purpose.'' I cannot put 
this type of researchers in charge of a project. Future 
researchers must work on acquiring the ability to ``debate.'' 
Perhaps we can say that this is what javelin throwing practice 
is all about. 
<H3>  NTT - Mr. Miyawaki, Managing Director and Head of R&amp;D 
Headquarters </H3>
  Main R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Began Integrated Experiment (Second Phase of VI&amp;P 
Experiment) of high-speed and broad-band communication system 
involving high-speed multimedia service and computer 
communication;

transmission; 
  (4) Verification of 0.2-micron CMOS gate array's low-energy, 
high-speed actions; 
  (5) Discovery of new geometric optical illusion phenomenon 
(quantum-lens optical illusion). 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) New communication service (high-speed computer 
communication, personal communication, and multimedia 
communication); 
  (2) High-speed, wide-band communication (ATM node-link, 
optical line subscriber); 
  (3) Customer networking; 
  (4) Photonics (optic wave communication, optic exchange, and 
optic information processing); 
  (5) Nanoelectronics (low power-ultra speed LSI, quantum 
effect). 
<H3>  Important for Telecommunication Business to Establish Setup 
Design to Deal with Sweeping Change Affecting Industry </H3>
  The environment surrounding the telecommunication industry 
is 
facing a sweeping change. It will be important for our R&amp;D 
division to be able to deal quickly with new R&amp;D themes as a 
result of the emergence of new service needs or with changes 
which may occur in management environment. 
  From a service standpoint, indications are that the fusion 
of 
communication and broadcasting or that of communication and 
computer will advance rapidly. 
  For instance, the type of image transmission service which 
can be offered to homes varies depending on a system involved. 
However, it is too late to conduct R&amp;D in image transmission 
after the system already has been decided upon. We believe that 
the VI&amp;P experiment currently being pursued by our company 
will 
be sufficiently comprehensive to take care of a wide variety of 
cases. 
  The processing capability of terminals linked to network 
will 
drastically increase in the near future. This increasingly will 
create the need for offering the kind of network services which 
can be controlled at terminals rather than at the networks 
themselves. 
  Because of anticipated changes impacting a form of service, 
one telephone company after another in the United States are 
opting for joint undertaking of R&amp;D projects. Also for us in 
Japan, joint research is becoming a necessity. In the past, 
prerequisite to our company's joint R&amp;D efforts mostly had 
to do 
with a supply of equipment. In the future, it will become 
necessary to conduct R&amp;D project jointly with other company 
even 
without such a prerequisite. 
<H5>  Dividing R&amp;D Division Should Be Avoided </H5>
  From the management environment standpoint, a debate on 
whether we should go ahead with the dividing of the R&amp;D 
Division 
in 1995 will become a full-scale undertaking. 
  Speaking in terms of our R&amp;D division alone, however, I 
do 
not believe that the division will be split. We are entrusted 
with a mission of pursuing R&amp;D from the standpoint of common 
good as stipulated by the law. If our R&amp;D division becomes 
smaller units by the split, R&amp;D power also becomes mitigated, 
which means that we will not be able to complete our mission. 
  From the R&amp;D standpoint, the split also will have 
negative 
effect on NTT's branches, such as NTT Mobile Communication 
Network (Everywhere) and Data Communication units. From the 
management standpoint, however, the division of the unit 
certainly will increase efficiency. I am not saying ``no'' to 
the establishment of branch units through split of various 
company divisions. What I am pointing out is that we must give a 
careful consideration to its method so that its adverse effects 
can be minimized. 
<H3>  Sanyo Electric - Mr. Kotoku Kuwano, Managing Director and 
Head of R&amp;D Division </H3>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Liquid crystal projector type 3-D display which does not 
require glasses (Jointly developed with NHK Engineering Service 
and Toppan Printing Co.); 
  (2) Development of a CD with four-times a storage capacity 
of 
existing CDs and a moving picture CD player for MPEG1; 
  (3) Development of the lithium ion secondary battery which 
uses a load material of 370mAh/g capacity; 
  (4) Development of a practical photovoltaic technology; 
  (5) Semiconductor quantum effect transistor TNT (Two Mode 
Channel FET) for use in radio receiver/transmitter. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Development of multimedia-related technologies such as 
the next generation high quality display and an optic disk 
device; 
  (2) Development of such new material-related basic 
technologies as a high-performance secondary battery and solar 
cell; 
  (3) Development of microelectronic-related technologies such 
as polycrystalline Si liquid crystal and multimedia LSI element 
technologies; 
  (4) Development of mechatronics-related technologies such as 
non-CFC refrigeration technology and control technology 
utilizing neural network and CAOS (completely automatic 
operational system). 
<H3>  Today's R&amp;D Project Compels Japan To Establish Concept 
First </H3>
  In the United States, researchers establish the concept of 
what they wish to achieve first before undertaking R&amp;D. In 
the 
future, Japanese manufacturers also should undertake the kind of 
R&amp;D project which has a concept and philosophy put in the 
forefront. What matters most is that firm convictions 
(philosophy) held by researchers in undertaking R&amp;D. 
  In the case of Japan, unlike the United States, the 
regulation will not allow mutual participation of a broadcasting 
company and a communication firm in an R&amp;D project, and, 
therefore, this may be more difficult to achieve. However, as 
long as a researcher has an idea which he wants to realize and 
does all he can to convince others around him, I am certain that 
it will become possible. I have pursued my idea in the field of 
solar battery by proposing the ``GENESIS Project,'' aimed at 
distributing electricity by connecting the world with 
superconductive cables. By persuading a government agency to 
install a solar battery at each household and to make reverse 
power flow feasible, I finally have managed to realize my idea. 
<H5>  Creation of Exciting and Electrifying Multimedia </H5>
  We are devoting a great deal of our effort to R&amp;D of 
multimedia equipment. We entered the field through 
audio-visuals, thereby making the most of Sanyo Electric's 
technology. A path to multimedia research will be opened as long 
as we have a conviction. 
  We limited our efforts in achieving only efficiency and 
serviceability in the multimedia products thus far developed. 
However, those products will not be adequate for society which 
attained maturity, namely, that of the United States, Europe, 
and Japan. Unless they contain elements of excitement and 
inspiration, they will not be well received. 
  In comparison with the time allocated to TV news 
broadcasting, time given to TV entertainment hours are far 
longer. The reason why a game software costing several thousand 
yen sells well and J league is enormously popular is that they 
generate excitement and sensation among the audience. Pursuing 
only serviceability in multimedia will not give the company a 
competitive edge. Ultimately, the market will be won by those 
who can offer the best cost performance. 
  It follows then that the only way we can open up the 
multimedia market is through a home electric generation system. 
If we develop multimedia equipment as an extension of the 
computer, it will end up being nothing more than a product of 
convenience similar to the one pursued in developing electronic 
pad. It will not generate excitement among the audience, the 
kind of excitement only realtime three-dimensional natural 
images can create. 
  Bearing the foregoing in mind, we are working on the 
development of multimedia element technologies. Although 
development schedule has yet to be determined, it is our wish to 
develop MPEG 2 chip within the year 1994. The chips will be used 
in products one year after they have been developed. Within the 
next few years, we intend to make an announcement which will 
generate a great deal of excitement over our products. 
<H3>  IBM-Japan - Mr. Seiji Ishida, Managing Director-Vice 
President and Head of R&amp;D Headquarters </H3>
  Main R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Gentle to global environment ``Green PC'' designed to 
save space and energy, and to reduce noises; 
  (2) Reorganized environment for creating and using 
multimedia 
achieved through a system software designed to deal with 
multimedia; 
  (3) An 18-inch high-precision liquid crystal panel; 
  (4) a 25-inch large volume magnetic disk using an MR 
(magneto 
resistive) head. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) Development of a system fully utilizing Power PC's 
powerful processing capability; 
  (2) Human centric-related technology, the foremost of which 
is multimedia computer equipped with a human-like quality; 
  (3) To achieve high speed and a large storage capacity in a 
small magnetic disk; 
  (4) High-performance graphic system. 
<H5>  User Needs Incorporated Even in Basic Research </H5>
  It is true that IBM is cutting back its R&amp;D spending. 
However, we are not reducing our output. It is possible to 
reduce spending without reducing output also. Spending cuts came 
from reduction in fees paid for use of office space and in the 
number of staff employees. From the international standard, fees 
for use of office space were too high. 
  IBM research laboratories consist of a basic research 
laboratory in Tokyo and product laboratories located in [Yasu], 
Fujisawa, and Yamato. They are conducting R&amp;D projects in 
cooperation with the entire IBM laboratories. [Yasu] Laboratory 
specializes in microelectronics, including semiconductors, while 
Fujisawa and Yamato are developing magnetic disks and personal 
computer/network systems, respectively. 
  The center of gravity of these researches is the development 
of personal system products. It is a field which shows a great 
deal of promise. In this personal system field, the United 
States will emerge as an advanced market. For this reason, 
development of a product targeting the U.S market will come 
first. 
  As for R&amp;D priority, product development directly leads 
to 
commercialization will receive the first priority. We gave 
priority to those product developments which contribute to 
company's profitability, while withdrawing those which produce 
little profits. We move at a fast pace in R&amp;D and do not 
hesitate to use other companies' products if they are good. 
Moreover, we are considering the formation of an alliance with 
other companies so that we can share R&amp;D tasks. 
  With respect to computer system basic research, we send 
researchers to the business division so that they will have the 
opportunity to come in contact with users and to understand 
their needs. Otherwise, research may become nothing more than a 
researcher's ego trip. However, this arrangement will not apply 
to those pursuing element technology such as solid state 
research. 
<H5>  Development of ``Human-Centric'' Interface </H5>
  The highlight of our 1994 R&amp;D undertaking will consist 
of the 
following: 
  (1) human-centric interface technology designed for closer 
interaction of man and machine; 
  (2) object-oriented technology. The goal of our compact-size 
magnetic disk project will be the development of a 3.5-inch disk 
with a 1G-byte memory. 
<H5>  Electrotechnical Lab (ETL) - Mr. Sakutaro Toyama, Director </H5>
  Major R&amp;D Achievements for 1993: 
  (1) Proposal for low defect density amorphous Si which broke 
through the theoretical wall of thermal equilibrium; 
  (2) Development of a high-sensitivity magnetic sensor which 
uses a vacuum micro-device; 
  (3) Development of a super-speed superconductive LSI module 
on which a Josephson element is mounted; 
  (4) Explanation of motion control function by using a 
reverse 
dynamic computation of the cerebellum; 
  (5) Development of an anisotropic high-temperature 
superconductive element; 
  (6) Super-vacuum atom-count technology using laser 
ionization. 
  R&amp;D Themes for 1994: 
  (1) User-friendly processing of sensitivity information; 
  (2) Superconductive power electronics elements; 
  (3) Development of super-flow operating system; 
  (4) Development of advanced ceramics material for use in 
thermo-electric conversion; 
  (5) Research in coordinated architecture software model. 
<H3>  Aiming for Information Processing Best Suited to Japanese, 
Research Approached from Software and Device Standpoints </H3>
  In the field of transmission of information, the United 
States is showing a great deal of vitality. The United States 
always has led Japan in this field because of its superior 
technologies, the most representative of which probably is a 
basic software technology. The gap, in fact, is so wide that it 
is not easy for Japan to catch up with the United States. 
However, this does not mean that Japan is inferior in every 
aspect of software technology. In the game software field, Japan 
offers a higher standard. 
  The question, then, is why Japan lags behind the U.S. in the 
information communication field when it is capable of producing 
excellent game software. I suggest that this is not the problem 
of technology or capability but rather that of users. Japanese 
users are not effective in handling information systems. They 
are not particularly skilled in utilizing information so that 
value can be added to whatever they do or produce. Consequently, 
networking does not develop. 
  The reason why Japanese cannot utilize information 
effectively is that perhaps they feel ``regardless of what 
information says, truth can be obtained only by asking people.'' 
In addition, Japanese users tend to seek information on many 
values and prices all at once. When they are unable to obtain 
such information, they doubt the validity of the information 
source itself. 
<H5>  Role of National Research Institute To Provide Guidance </H5>
  At ETL, we selected research themes so that these problems 
can be dealt with. Since ETL is a national research facility, we 
spent our time listening to users' ``extravagant'' demands and 
are devoting our effort to the kind of research which will 
produce a software which users will find ``interesting.'' Our 
theme, ``coordinated architecture,'' is an example of the kind 
of software we have in mind. Not only in software research but 
also in device research, we are aiming for information 
processing which are best suited to Japanese. More specifically, 
we are working on devices to be used in both optical and 
parallel information processing. 
  Although research themes on our list do not appear too 
different from those of manufacturers, their contents are 
substantially different. With our themes, it is difficult to 
predict where they will lead us. In recessionary times, business 
is not likely to take on this type of themes. Our aim is to make 
clear where these themes will lead us. I believe this is the 
role of the national research institute.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Professor Kenichi Iga, Tokyo Institute of 
Technology, first proposed the concept of the surface emission 
laser in 1977. At that time, devices like the optical computer 
were mere dreams. Even the idea of an optical interconnection 
that can transmit a large quantity of signals via an array of 
surface emission lasers had not been thought of. Actually, 
Professor Iga's proposal was motivated by a simple 
thought--trying to find a laser that could be mass produced 
better. 
<H5>  Sandwich the Activated Layer </H5>
  Professor Iga began research on semiconductor lasers for 
optical communication in a group led by his advisor, Dr. 
Yasuharu Suematsu (formerly president of Tokyo Institute of 
Technology). Although his research proceeded smoothly, and he 
was able to make prototype elements that actually worked, 
Professor Iga also felt dissatisfaction. 
  At that time, the mainstream method for manufacturing 
semiconductor lasers was to split a crystal to form a smooth 
surface called a cleavage plane, and then make that into a 
reflective mirror for a resonator. With that method it was 
difficult to mass produce elements of uniform quality. Some 
researchers proposed making elements without cleavage planes, 
such as in distribution feedback lasers that incorporate a 
diffraction grating, but Professor Iga says, ``Because it was 
not my own idea, it just didn't feel right to me.'' 
  After a lot of thought, what Professor Iga came up with was 
the structure of a perpendicular resonating laser in which the 
activated layer (emitting part) is sandwiched between reflective 
films above and below, and the laser light is generated 
perpendicular to the substrate. With this structure, a number of 
elements could be formed on a single substrate, and the lasers 
could be mass produced merely by cutting them off one by one. 
  Preceding Professor Iga's idea, researchers at Xerox in the 
U.S. announced the creation of a surface emission laser in 1975. 
It had diffraction gratings piled on top of the activated layer, 
and basically the structure was pretty much the same as previous 
lasers. Then in 1987 researchers at MIT proposed the reflective 
mirror type of surface emission laser. This device had a crystal 
with a cleavage plane cut at a 45 angle set in the path of 
light emitted horizontally and used this crystal to change the 
direction of the light, but the method for generating the light 
was no different than before. Compared with these methods, 
Professor Iga's idea is truly innovative. 
<H5>  Scholars Originally Skeptical </H5>
  Yet, a long time passed before the value of his idea was 
recognized. In 1979 Professor Iga made prototype elements with 
activated layers of indium-gallium-arsenic-phosphorus and cooled 
with them liquid nitrogen to generate pulsed oscillations. 
Professor Iga says, ``If a large current was applied they would 
light up for an instant before they fell apart.'' 
  At academic conferences these experimental results got a 
very 
cold reception, and most scholars thought the elements could 
never be put to practical use. In addition to Dr. Suematsu, 
however, a small number of researchers from the U.S. and former 
Soviet Union encouraged Iga by saying his results were 
interesting and worth pursuing. 
  Then unexpected advantages appeared. Researchers realized 
that surface emission lasers will be most suitable for hookups 
to optical fibers because they emit a narrower beam than 
previous types of lasers, etc. It was discovered that short 
wavelength prototype lasers made by replacing the original 
material with gallium-arsenic elements also required less 
current for oscillation than older surface emission lasers. 
Research on surface emission lasers was selected by MOE for its 
Specially Promoted Distinguished Research funding in the latter 
half of the 1980s, and this provided a budget for Professor Iga 
to make his own state-of-the-art device for manufacturing 
semiconductor thin films. In the fall of 1988 about ten years 
after he first proposed the idea, working with Assistant 
Professor Fumio Koyama, Professor Iga created a surface emission 
laser that could produce continuous short wavelength emissions 
at room temperature. This triggered research throughout the 
world because the advantages of surface emission lasers made 
them promising candidates for the main components of optical 
computers and next-generation optical communications systems. 
Professor Iga's group went on to achieve continuous oscillation 
at room temperature in the 1.3 wavelength band suitable for 
optical communications, so at last Professor Iga's dream was 
becoming reality. 
<H5>  Beyond Expectations </H5>
  Now all major electronics manufacturers are doing research 
on 
surface emission lasers. Their main focus is the development of 
surface emission lasers that will form the optical 
interconnections in MITI's Real World Computing (Four 
Dimensional Computer) Project which will last for the next ten 
years, and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) Projects in 
the U.S. Professor Iga created the surface emission laser 
because it would be easy to mass produce, but now it has grown 
into an element far beyond his original concept. 
  Several faculty members who worked with Professor Iga on 
research have moved on to other universities, and former 
students in his lab now work for domestic and foreign 
semiconductor manufacturers. All continue their cutting-edge 
research. We can expect research on elements for practical 
application to accelerate rapidly in the future. Professor Iga 
intends to remain at the forefront saying, ``Signal hookups for 
parallel computers, etc., should be realized in the near 
future.''

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Micro-electro-discharge machining (micro-EDM) is used for 
micro-processing in many fields, mainly for high precision 
boring of microholes in the nozzles of ink jet printers, etc. 
Recently we developed two new models, the ultramicro-EDM MG-ED71 
for boring and MG-ED51 for shaft processing. Using both machines 
we can bore microholes up to 5m in diameter with highly 
precise positioning resolution of 0.1m. 
  The boring machine is mainly for high precision boring of 
microholes, but it also has 3-axis NC functions and can be used 
as a milling machine to form three-dimensional microshapes. The 
shaft processing machine was developed for the purpose of 
automatically forming the tool electrodes for the boring 
machine. It uses wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG), and can 
form microshafts as small as 5m thanks to its high precision 
positioning mechanism and highly stable microwire feed control. 
  In addition to its high precision micro-EDM capability, the 
MG-ED71 can easily penetrate sheet thicknesses up to ten times 
greater than the hole diameter, although an aspect ratio of more 
than five times greater than the hole diameter has been very 
difficult to bore in the past. In addition, boring of holes 
0.1-0.3mm in diameter, which has been quite time-consuming in 
the past, can easily be accomplished with high precision in a 
relatively short period of time. Surely, the applications of 
micro-EDM will grow in the field of micromachining. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Electronic equipment such as AV equipment and computer 
peripheral devices are becoming smaller and smaller. This 
equipment is not only becoming more compact, but users are 
demanding high-quality performance such as greater accuracy and 
density at the same time. The micronization of mechanical parts, 
which has lagged behind the micronization of electronic parts, 
and the development of high-precision technology to manufacture 
these mechanical parts have become urgent needs. 
  Machining dies at an aspect ratio of 5-10 times has become 
necessary to provide both micronization and strength. Moreover, 
although drills were used before, micro-EDM has become 
increasingly popular for boring of holes 0.1-0.3mm in diameter 
because of its high quality since it does not produce burrs, and 
because it is very accurate in terms of roundness and proper 
degree of taper. 
  Moreover, the development of micromachines has begun in 
earnest in recent years as a dream technology for the future. 
Most attempts at manufacturing micromachines have relied on 
applications of LSI technology, but micro-EDM has shown great 
promise because of its greater capability to form 
three-dimensional shapes. 
  To respond to the needs for this kind of microprocessing, we 
have developed ultramicro-EDM machines that provide greater 
precision and micronization than the micro-EDM technology 
previously developed by the Matsushita Research Institute in 
Tokyo. 
  In this article I will explain the features, specifications, 
and precision obtained by this ultramicro-EDM equipment, and 
discuss in detail ultramicro-processing, deep hole boring at 
high aspect ratio, and micromachining of three-dimensional 
shapes. 
<H5>  2. Characteristics of Micro-EDM </H5>
  The characteristics of micro-EDM can be summarized as 
follows: 
  (1) Any conductive material can be processed--especially, 
hard materials such as quench-hardened steel and sintered hard 
alloys can be easily processed. Furthermore, it is possible to 
machine silicon, which may crack under conventional 
electro-discharge machining.[.sup]1[/] 
  (2) High precision machining of curved surfaces, slanting 
surfaces, and thin materials is possible because processing 
takes place without applying mechanical force to the workpiece. 
  (3) Machining of shapes with high aspect ratios is possible, 
and in the case of hole boring, depths as great as five times 
the hole diameter are easily obtained. 
  (4) Because the processing units are very small, this method 
provides an excellent surface smoothness of up to 0.1m 
Rmax.[.sup]2[/] 
<H5>  3. Structure of Ultramicro-EDM Machine </H5>
  The shaft processing machine (MG-ED51) and the boring 
machine 
(MG-ED71), which is shown in Figure 1, are required for 
ultramicro-EDM. Table 1 shows the main specifications for each 
machine, and Figure 2 shows the basic structures common to the 
ultramicro-EDM machines. The basic structures can be roughly 
divided into a machining head member, a positioning mechanism 
member, and a micro-ED circuit and NC control member. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-48A>           Fig. 1 Photo of Micro-EDM Boring Machine MG-ED71 </FIG>




  3.1 Machining Head Member and Z-Axis Mechanism 
  The machining head member has a mandrel attached to it that 
incorporates the tool electrode. It consists of a V-bearing made 
of ceramic material to provide rotary support and a DC motor 
that provides rotary drive for the mandrel.[.sup]2[/] 
  In previous models the mandrel slid vertically in this 
V-bearing when it was positioned on the Z-axis, but there were 
disadvantages such as a stroke distance of only 3mm. Therefore, 
we modified the design so that the whole machining head would 
move on the Z-axis. The Z-axis has a range of 70mm and is moved 
in 0.05m increments by a stepping motor and a ball screw. A 
machining range of 10mm is shown in Table 1 because the range is 
dependent on the depth of the processing tank. The machining 
depth also depends on the shape to be machined, so not all 
microholes can be bored to a depth of 10mm (See 4.2 below). 
  The outside of the mandrel is in contact with the V-bearing 
via a belt, and its upper end is attached to a steel ball. It is 
supported so that it receives thrust at the contact point on its 
top. It is connected to the discharge circuit via the contact 
point. This bearing system features high rotary precision, there 
is almost no centering misalignment when the mandrel is attached 
or removed, and it is easy to handle. Because both the boring 
machine and shaft processing machine use exactly the same 
bearing system, it is possible to measure and check the 
dimensions of the tool electrodes made by the shaft processing 
machine under a microscope and then install them directly in the 
boring machine, which facilitates machining quality control. 
  3.2 Discharge Circuit and Discharge Control 
  The shaft processing machine is a machine designed to 
automate electrode forming, and to do so the discharge energy 
conditions from rough processing to finishing must be set 
automatically. To achieve micromachining on the order of 0.1mm 
or less, it is necessary to reduce the single pulse discharge 
energy to the range of 10[.sup]-7[/] J, so an R-C circuit was 
chosen as the discharge circuit. Moreover, a layout was selected 
to keep the floating capacitance in the circuit and the tool 
electrode at a minimum.[.sup]2[/] The discharge energy can be 
set by adjusting the voltage of the R-C circuit and capacitor 
capacitance. The voltage can be selected with high precision in 
1V units with a D/A converter, but setting the capacitance of 
the capacitor is very complex. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2., 
we chose a format in which four types of capacitors can be 
switched by relays. By moving the capacitor switching circuit 
and the position of the resistor as close as possible to the 
tool electrode, we can suppress the floating capacitance. 
  Control of the discharge is accomplished by a simple system 
that uses a charging current detector on the R-C circuit to 
determine whether it is discharging or there is a short, and if 
there is a short, it opens the gap. 
  3.3 Structure of Shaft Processing Machine 
  The shaft processing machine is a device for automatically 
forming the tool electrodes used on the boring machine, and it 
uses the wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG) method proposed 
by professor Takahisa Masuzawa, Institute of Industrial Science, 
University of Tokyo.[.sup]3[/] Figure 3 shows the principle 
of WEDG. The wire that forms the tool electrode is fed 
continuously over the wire guide, and at a place where it is 
supported by the wire guide, a processing micro-ED is generated 
between the wire and the shaft being processed. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-49B>           Fig. 3 Principle of WEDG </FIG>




  The wire guide is on the X-axis, and it is positioned in 
0.1m units. The wire material bobbin, takeup bobbin and the 
wire drive mechanism are all on the X-axis, and variations in 
wire tension are eliminated as positioning takes place on the 
X-axis. The wire drive uses a constant-rate takeup, and the wire 
is given uniform tension by constant-current control of a DC 
motor connected to the wire material bobbin on the other 
end.[.sup]4[/] 
  Because the range of movement is only 0.5mm or less, we use 
an open control system with a stepping motor and ball screw for 
positioning on the X-axis. Errors due to backlash are controlled 
by making the positioning movements constantly in the forward 
direction. 
  Because it is not equipped with a function for calculating 
mandrel rotation, rotational symmetry is the basis for shapes 
that can be processed on the shaft processing machine. As shown 
in Figure 4, it can process microshafts with tapers, shapes with 
a spherical radius, and various combinations of these. Because 
100m diameter brass wire was used, a radius of 50m is 
left 
at the step. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-50A>           Fig. 4 Shapes Machined by Micro-EDM MG-ED51 </FIG>




  As shown in Table 1, the boring machine has five operation 
modes. The machining modes include the AUTO mode, in which 
equally spaced holes are machined continuously in a row, and 
REMOTE mode, which operates on commands from an external 
computer. 
  In AUTO mode automatic processing can be achieved merely by 
inputting machining conditions and hole position data with very 
simple programming on the NC controller. However, machining 
shapes are limited to holes or slits made from combinations of 
holes. 
  With REMOTE mode it is possible to easily machine large 
shapes with more complex data. An RS-232C port is used for 
command communications, so any computer can be used. REMOTE mode 
has a function to detect all the settings for conditions 
relevant to machining; that is, discharge voltage, choice of 
capacitor, feed rate setting, movement designations, machining 
movement designations, and machine status (coordinate values, 
processing status). It is possible to machine shapes at will by 
combining these various parameters. 
  The X and Y tables each have a glass scale origin. By using 
the mode that automatically returns them to their origins 
(RETURN), it is possible to take them back to their original 
positions with high precision after interrupting an operation in 
progress. 
  As far as the shape of the tool electrode is concerned, 
reversed-polarity discharge can be performed on the boring 
machine using block electrodes, etc., independent of the shaft 
processing machine. Some methods other than WEDG are better for 
forming relatively long tool electrodes. Figure 6 compares the 
WEDG and the block methods. Because WEDG uses a single point for 
machining, it is not efficient in terms of time for forming long 
electrodes. Moreover, with the tungsten that is normally used 
for tool electrodes, there is a problem because if the cut made 
on a single pass is too deep, the material tends to bend after 
machining due to internal strain. Block forming, on the other 
hand, is efficient because the length to be machined can be cut 
with a single discharge, and the electrode does not bend easily, 
most likely because the material is removed uniformly and slowly 
over its whole length. In the past block forming was done 
manually and required considerable skill, but this task has now 
become rather easy if the movements are programmed into a 
computer.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-52A>           Fig. 10. Method for Forming Tool Electrode for Microslot </FIG>




  4.2 Deep Hole Machining 
  With micro-EDM it is possible to machine a hole to a depth 
up 
to five times the diameter of the hole, and for boring deeper 
holes with a higher aspect ratio methods such as using a tool 
electrode shaped like a half moon have been devised. Wear is 
extensive, however, when using a half-moon shaped tool 
electrode, so longer electrodes are necessary. This causes a 
problem because long electrodes tend to bend after they are 
formed and vibrate during machining, which makes boring accuracy 
difficult to control. 
  It is difficult to bore holes more than five times deeper 
than their diameter because the insulating oil does not easily 
reach the tip of the electrode and it is difficult to remove 
machining dust. Moving the workpiece relative to the tool 
electrode is one way used to bore deep holes without using a 
special tool electrode. On this boring machine we have installed 
a brand new machining mode so we can set the vibrational 
amplitude in 0.1m units for either the X- or Y-axis and feed 
the tool electrode as it vibrates at several Hertz. This 
machining mode forms an oblong hole, so we use it for rough 
machining. We then finish the workpiece to obtain a straight, 
deep hole. 
  Amplitude is an important parameter in this mode since the 
tool electrode vibrates as it processes. I will explain this 
more specifically using the experimental results of machining at 
an aspect ratio of 10 as shown in Table 2. The tool electrode 
diameter and amplitude were set so that the hole would be 
2.5m long and 1.0m wide when ready for finishing.

  Figure 11 shows experimental results of wear length when the 
vibration is in the horizontal direction and machining is in the 
vertical direction. In the experiment at 20m it was not 
possible to form a straight electrode of the required length 
less than 10m in diameter. In both trials, the electrode did 
not penetrate when the amplitude was 2.5m, so those values 
are not accurate. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-52B>           Fig. 11 Wear Length and Vibration Amplitude with Vibration </FIG>




  As the data shows, penetration is possible with an amplitude 
of 5m or more, and we can easily bore deep holes. As the 
amplitude increases, the wear length also increases uniformly in 
proportion to the volume removed. 
  It appears that the limit of deep holes bored with this 
method depends on the workpiece material and how long a tool 
electrode we can form. 
  This method is not only used for deep hole boring, but it is 
also effective for rapidly boring holes greater than 0.1m in 
diameter with high precision. 
  4.3 Making Microparts 
  With the features I have noted, micro-EDM offers a method 
other than a semiconductor manufacturing process for realizing 
micromachines. Below I will show some examples of machining 
potential microparts for use in micromachines. 
  Figure 12 is an SEM photo and a schematic diagram showing 
the 
mechanism and dimensions of a microspring formed on a silicon 
wafer. This process penetrates the silicon wafer to form a 
parallel spring mechanism as shown by the two thin sheets 
20m 
thick. Micro-EDM can easily create high aspect ratio microshapes 
on a wafer that cannot be penetrated by photolithography. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-53A>           Fig. 12. Silicon Microspring Mechanism </FIG>




  Thus, the ultramicro-EDM machines can machine miniature 
shapes on miniature parts with great precision. 
  Figure 14 shows a metal die for molding a 0.033 modular 
involute gear with a pitch diameter of 0.3mm. The material is 
100m thick stainless steel. In this case the involute form 
was created using a 20m diameter tool electrode after a 
combination of holes was bored for rough machining.[.sup]4[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-53B>           Figure </FIG>



<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  In this article I have explained the technical features of 
the ultramicro-EDM machines. It is now possible to do machining 
that was difficult in the past such as ultramicromachining of 
holes to 5m in diameter, boring deep holes with an aspect 
ratio of ten, etc. I believe these machines can be used to make 
a variety of microparts for micromachines. I believe that 
ultramicro-EDM will be important in the future as a 
manufacturing technology where more micronization and greater 
precision are required. 
  In closing I deeply thank professor Takahisa Masuzawa, 
Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo for his 
valuable leadership in developing this technology.

  [Text]Federation of Electric Power Companies Chairman Kohei 
Abe (president, Chubu Electric Power Company) revealed in a 
press conference on 19 November that it now appears certain 
construction on the FBR demonstration reactor will not begin 
until after the turn of the century. The FBR forms plutonium and 
generates electric power at the same time, so it produces a 
greater amount of fresh fuel than it consumes. The present 
Long-Range Plan for Development and Use of Atomic Energy 
(established in 1990) targets construction for the FBR 
demonstration reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s. 
  The demonstration reactor, which will have an output of 
670,000 kW, is the successor to the FBR prototype Monju (Tsuruga 
City, Fukui Prefecture; output 280,00 kW) built by PNC that is 
due to reach criticality next year. It has already been 
determined that the demonstration reactor will have a top entry 
format, which will give it shorter piping and a simpler 
structure than Monju. The site, however, is still undecided. 
  The Federation of Electric Power Companies FBR Policy 
Council, consisting of the Executive Vice Presidents in Charge 
of Atomic Energy of the Nine Power Companies, has been reviewing 
the question of when to start construction of the FBR 
demonstration reactor. The Council concluded in its interim 
report that construction should be postponed. Mr. Abe said, ``I 
believe there will be a report (on delaying the start of 
construction) at the next Nine Power Companies Presidential 
Meeting (scheduled for 15 December).'' 
  For the same amount of output, construction costs FBRs will 
not only run 1.5 times those of the mainstream LWR commercial 
power plants currently in use, but it appears that delays in the 
startup of Monju have affected the decision to postpone 
construction of the demonstration reactor. The U.S. and 
countries in Europe, which led the way in FBR research, are 
abandoning or suspending FBR projects one after the other.

signed an agreement for a Japan/Russia cooperation plan that 
includes among other things installing an abnormal sound 
detection system in a Russian nuclear reactor. This is part of 
Japan's policy to provide aid to Russia in improving safety in 
reactors of the former Soviet Union (RBMK reactors). 
  The abnormality detection system involves installing a high 
temperature-resistant, radiation-resistant microphone in the 
reactor containment vessel. It works by detecting abnormal 
sounds produced by leaks, etc., inside the reactor and warning 
the operators with an alarm. The system has a signal processing 
device to distinguish abnormal sounds from the sounds caused by 
vibration, etc., that accompany normal reactor operation, and it 
uses an acoustic filter to detect only the abnormal sounds. 
  This is implementation of cooperative research based on the 
Japan/Russia Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. The detection system 
with the microphone will be installed in the Sosunoviboru 
[phonetic] NPP II (formerly Leningrad NPP II) by the end of 
1996. The costs for the first year are expected to be about 
&yen;960,000,000.

  [Text] The construction plan for the new demonstration ATR 
that the Electric Power Development Company is building at Oma 
City, Aomori Prefecture, will be postponed about one year. The 
Demonstration ATR Construction Promotion Committee comprised of 
representatives from the electric power industry, MITI, STA, 
etc., will make its decision in the near future. The 
construction plan that will be presented to the Electric Power 
Development Coordination Council in December 1994 will call for 
construction to begin in April 1997 and operation to begin in 
2003. 
  The plan has been delayed by lengthy negotiations over 
compensation with the local fishermen's union, but the Oma 
Fishermen's Association decided to accept the prefecture's 
mediation concerning additional fishing industry compensation, 
so it is possible that negotiations will finally move forward 
once again. 
  This is the seventh postponement since the Promotion 
Committee first hammered out the demonstration ATR construction 
process in 1985.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Japan/U.S. and Japan/Russia cooperation will begin 
next year on research to test and analyze the extent of 
embrittlement in pressure vessels due to radiation in material 
removed from closed reactors. In a five-year plan JAERI will 
conduct tests with Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the U.S. 
on materials used in the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor 
(Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture) now under disassembly and 
with the Kuruchatofu [phonetic] Laboratories on a disassembled 
Russian reactor. JAERI expects this to be a valuable resource 
for making decisions on measures to counter reactor aging and to 
extend reactor life. 
  Recently JAERI and Oak Ridge agreed to a research 
cooperation 
agreement for testing and analyzing JPDR pressure vessel steel. 
They will work together on mechanical strength tests, structural 
observations by electron microscope, etc., using steel removed 
from the JPDR pressure vessel. 
  Because the U.S. Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission is 
preparing regulatory standards for the renewal of LWR permits, 
it is seeking data on changes over time in actual reactors, and 
it asked JAERI about cooperation using JPDR, which recorded 12 
years of operation. Because Japan does not have adequate 
facilities for testing radioactive materials, Japan decided that 
the cooperation would be beneficial to both nations. 
  In cooperative research with Russia, JAERI will use Russia 
NPP 27, which is a closed reactor that operated for 33 years. 
Researchers will bore cylindrical samples from the pressure 
vessel and bring them back to Japan for analysis. Japan plans to 
bear the costs over the next five years by paying the 
Kuruchatofu Laboratory about &yen;23,000,000 a year for its part 
in the study. 
  The STA expects that this test data will form the basis for 
revision of regulatory standards for the LWRs that electric 
power companies are using in Japan. 
  As a way of increasing the number of years of operation in 
nuclear power plants, the government, mainly through MITI's 
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, will consider 
``streamlining'' the safety regulations that are more stringent 
than necessary, but convincing data is needed to do so. 
  Japan's LWRs are either BWRs or PWRs. JPDR is a BWR, and 
Russia NPP 27 is a PWR, so STA believes that it will be possible 
to do research and testing on the characteristics of both types 
of reactors.

  [Text] On 15 November the STA announced it has begun 
full-fledged joint research with Russia concerning a Reactor 
Operation Abnormality Detection System, and this research will 
be conducted as part of the atomic energy safety aid to nations 
of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The abnormality 
detection system, which uses a microphone developed by PNC, will 
be installed in a former Soviet-type reactor (RBMK), and Japan 
and Russia will conduct demonstration tests together. There are 
also plans for cooperation on a comprehensive leak detection 
system that uses microphones and piezosensors to maintain the 
soundness of reactor piping. This cooperation will be conducted 
under the framework of the Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement. 
The estimated budget for the project for 1993 [sic] is about 
&yen;960,000,000. 
  Japan and Russia have held three meetings of specialists and 
conducted discussions on the framework for cooperation and 
technical items. The result was a basic agreement on the 
contents of the cooperative project in July. Thereafter, 
diplomatic negotiations continued, and a letter of agreement was 
signed on 12 November. 
  The abnormality detection system will be installed inside 
the 
reactor containment vessel, and it will alert operators to 
abnormalities by detecting signals through the microphone.

  [Text] MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy will 
provide cooperation on safety to Asian countries such as China 
and ROK that are proceeding with plans for nuclear power plants. 
The government has decided that if the construction of nuclear 
power plants in Asian countries does not proceed smoothly, it 
will hinder their domestic development of atomic energy as a 
source for power. Therefore, the government is considering 
technical cooperation through the private sector. Specific 
policy will be discussed on 11 November at the meeting of the 
Atomic Energy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy 
(a MITI advisory body). 
  According to the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, 
among the countries in Asia, China plans to construct a total of 
six nuclear power plants, including those presently under 
construction, in the future. In addition, by the year 2006 ROK 
will increase its capability to generate power from nuclear 
energy to 23,200,000 kW, roughly three times the current level, 
and both Indonesia and Malaysia plan to begin generating power 
by nuclear energy. 
  Not only is there concern that Japan's environment may be 
adversely affected by a nuclear accident in Asia, but such an 
accident will make construction of nuclear power plants in Japan 
that much more difficult. Therefore, the government is 
considering such methods as promoting exchange of human 
resources and technology transfer from the private sector in an 
effort to encourage international cooperation and ensure safe 
operation.

  [Text] Monju, Japan's first power generating FBR will reach 
criticality in April 1994. This will mark the beginning of the 
Age of the FBR, and PNC (Takao Ishiwatari, director), which has 
been involved in FBR development, will begin construction on a 
Recycling Test Facility (RETF) at the end of 1993 with the goal 
of establishing FBR fuel reprocessing technology. Until this 
recycling system is perfected, operation of the FBR, which 
produces more nuclear fuel than it uses, will not go smoothly, 
and the original purpose for the FBR, the efficient utilization 
of nuclear fuel, will not be fulfilled. Other nations watching 
developments at PNC, which leads the rest of the world, in this 
area, quite closely. 
<H5>  Purex Process Recycling </H5>
  The RETF will confirm the technology for reprocessing spent 
fuel from the FBR in a hot lab and provide necessary data for 
the construction of a plant to be used in the Age of the FBR. 
The basis for the system will be the same as that used at the 
commercial reprocessing plant run by Japan Nuclear Fuel at 
Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture. It will use the wet 
reprocessing format known as the Purex Process. The validity of 
this method has been confirmed at CPF, PNC's high-level 
radioactive material research facility, by processing fuel from 
the FBR experimental reactor Joyo in hot tests since 1982. 
  When the FBR is in operation, three kinds of fuel that needs 
reprocessing are formed--core fuel consisting of mixed uranium 
and plutonium oxides, axial blanket fuel packed with depleted 
uranium, and horizontal blanket fuel. 
  The RETF processing consists of disassembling the fuel 
assemblies, cutting them up, dissolving the fuel, and isolating 
and extracting the uranium, plutonium, and high level wastes 
dissolved in the solution. Detailed design for this facility was 
begun in 1988, and preliminary construction began in 1991. 
<H5>  &yen;25,700,000,000 in Equipment Costs for 1994 </H5>
  In 1988 PNC completed a recycling test wing consisting of 
six 
stories above ground and two below (total floor space about 3800 
m[.sup]2[/]) at its Tokai Works at Tokai Village, Ibaraki 
Prefecture, and it plans to begin hot tests there in 2000. 
Construction costs for 1993 will be &yen;24,000,000,000, and 
equipment and facility costs for 1994 are expected to be 
&yen;25,700,000,000. The facility just received authorization 
from the Nuclear Safety Commission in August (authorization to 
alter the existing reprocessing plant). 
  Up till now, PNC has gained some insight on the practicality 
of equipment such as a fuel assembly disassembly device that 
uses a CO[.sup]2[/] laser for rapid and efficient removal of 
the wrapper pipes covering the FBR fuel assemblies, a compact, 
cylindrical, rotating continuous dissolving tank for rapidly 
dissolving the cut-up fuel, and centrifugal purification 
technology that uses centrifugal force to remove small particles 
mixed in with the solution. 
  At the same time, PNC has finished technical development on 
a 
two-armed servo manipulator for performing various tasks and 
routine maintenance of equipment by remote operation, and 
engineers have also made decisions on devices that can perform 
delicate tasks behind the equipment. PNC is also working on 
development of automatic sampling technology and a sampling 
robot. 
  If it handles only spent fuel, the processing capability of 
the RETF equipped with this advanced equipment will be a maximum 
of 1.3 tons annually (160 kg/day maximum, equivalent to 3 fuel 
assemblies) in uranium and plutonium equivalents. If the 
facility reprocesses both spent core fuel and spent blanket 
fuel, the maximum processing capability will be 6 tons annually 
(1 ton core fuel and 5 tons blanket fuel annually) in uranium 
and plutonium equivalents. 
<H5>  Stricter Protection Measures Needed </H5>
  PNC believes that FBR fuel reprocessing development will 
enter a new stage with the construction of this facility. 
However, there are still problems to be overcome in developing 
reprocessing technology. Stricter protection measures will be 
essential because the amount of plutonium to be handled and 
reprocessing costs will be greater than with LWRs. 
  Therefore, a major concern for a full-fledged reprocessing 
facility is the pursuit of cost effectiveness. The RETF will 
attempt to develop technology to reduce construction costs, 
improve equipment operation and maintenance, and increase the 
facility operating rate with the goal of attaining cost 
effectiveness of less than 2.5 times the number of tons 
processed. We can expect other goals to include technology for 
the recovery and recycling of transuranium elements (TRU), 
research to improve the Purex Process, and the introduction of 
artificial intelligence and expert systems.

  [Text] Tohoku Electric Power Company and Mitsubishi Kasei 
Corporation's Research Center have developed a new ion exchange 
resin with improved heat resistance up to 100C. Ion 
exchange resins used in nuclear power plant core water 
purification systems in the past have had a low maximum 
temperature for use of 60C, so it has been necessary to 
cool the 280C core water down to about 50C to purify 
it, which results in a large loss of heat. Researchers succeeded 
in synthesizing a strongly basic ion exchange resin with superb 
heat resistance by inserting alkyl spacer groups with three or 
more carbons between a styrene-divinyl benzene resin matrix and 
quaternary ammonium groups to separate them from each other. The 
effectiveness of this resin was confirmed in practical 
evaluative tests, and the researchers plan to proceed with 
development toward the establishment of an industrial 
manufacturing process in the future. 
  First researchers synthesized an ion exchange resin that has 
alkyl chains with different numbers of carbons by performing 
suspension polymerization of a styrene derivative containing 
alkyl spacer groups with divinyl benzene. Then they compared the 
survival rate of quaternary ammonium groups after exposure to 
100C temperatures for one month. In previous resins, the 
survival rate for quaternary ammonium groups (with single carbon 
atoms) lies in the 60% range, but when the number of 
carbons is 
increased to three or more, the survival rate jumps to 
80% or 
higher, which is a clear improvement in heat resistance. 
Researchers also confirmed that the thermal decomposition 
mechanism is different from that of previous resins. 
  The researchers also performed practical evaluative tests on 
the resin with four carbon atoms (C[.sup]4[/] resin). When 
they packed a column heated to 95C with 400 mL [sic] of 
resin and studied the loss in exchange quantity capability at a 
flow rate corresponding to 100 L/hour, the current strongly 
basic ion exchange resin (Mitsubishi Kasei brand Daiyaion 
[phonetic] SA10A) retained only 80% of its exchange capability 
after 15 days and dropped to 70% after one month. 
However, the 
C[.sup]4[/] resin retained 89% of its exchange capability 
after one month. When they tested the resin's silica adsorption 
performance at 95C, there was a slight amount of leakage 
with the initial water flow, but after steady state was 
achieved, the silica concentration values fell below the minimum 
required for analytical determination. 
  Nuclear power plants need more compact equipment, and if 
this 
resin enables core water to be purified at a higher temperature, 
it will lead to simpler heat exchangers. Researchers at both 
companies plan to perform evaluative tests in the future and 
work toward establishing an industrial manufacturing method.

  [Text] PNC, which has been conducting the 11th periodic 
inspection of the ATR Fugen nuclear power plant reactor 
(prototype reactor, rated output 165,000 kW) since 18 August, 
restarted the reactor and achieved criticality on 14 November. 
Today PNC will begin adjustment operation, which is the final 
stage of the periodic inspection process. Engineers will check 
out plant performance as they slowly increase output, and they 
plan to return to full operation after the government's final 
inspection in the middle of December. 
  In this periodic inspection, engineers inspected the reactor 
facility, turbine equipment and electrical equipment, and they 
confirmed there were no abnormalities.

  [Text] On 11 November the Atomic Energy Subcommittee 
(chairman: Isamu Yamashita, Advisor to the Federation of 
Economic Organizations), Advisory Committee for Energy, Agency 
of Natural Resources and Energy, MITI, began meetings to review 
nuclear fuel recycling operations and improved safety measures 
for nuclear power generation from the standpoint of overall 
government energy policy. The subcommittee will compile an 
outline for its interim report in the first part of May next 
year, and thereafter consider nuclear fuel recycling operations, 
international relations, etc., separately before issuing its 
final report. 
  The Basic Policy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for 
Energy has been meeting since September to deliberate stability 
and flexibility in energy supply. During the course of these 
discussions, it was noted that there is a need to consider the 
role of nuclear energy in light of a new energy policy based on 
changes in the environment. 
  While keeping a close eye on the status of the Long-Term 
Plan 
for Development and Use of Atomic Energy that is currently under 
review, the Atomic Energy Subcommittee decided to hold intensive 
discussions on improving the safety measures for nuclear power 
generation. 
  The first points for consideration are measures to improve 
safety in LWRs, which are the mainstream of nuclear power 
generation in Japan, and improving and expanding activities to 
present information and promote atomic energy in order to 
increase understanding of nuclear power generation among the 
general populace. 
  Second, it is important to obtain international 
understanding 
about nuclear fuel recycling operations in light of increasing 
interest throughout the world in nuclear non-proliferation, so 
the subcommittee will consider the course of future policy that 
can measure up to questioning from both foreign and domestic 
sources as it reaffirms the path toward reprocessing and 
recycling. 
  Third, the subcommittee will consider methods for 
cooperation 
in nuclear power safety, mainly with the countries in the 
vicinity of Japan that have already introduced nuclear power 
generation or plan to do so in the future.

  [Text] Recently the STA made a proposal for the commercial 
use of plutonium and an international management scheme for the 
highly enriched uranium and plutonium that will be removed from 
dismantled American and Russian nuclear weapons. The U.S. 
government has announced a new nuclear non-proliferation policy, 
and vigorous international discussions are expected over the 
management of plutonium. We interviewed STA Atomic Energy Bureau 
Director Hiroto Ishida concerning the goal of Japan's plan and 
the likely course of future debate. 
<H5>  Facilitate Mutual Understanding </H5>
  Question: Why did Japan propose its own plan for the 
international management of plutonium? 
  Reply: ``As far as overall atomic energy activities are 
concerned, including Japan's use of plutonium, we carefully 
follow the security measures of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, and we strive to provide the maximum amount of various 
kinds of information. As a result, I believe that beyond a 
shadow of a doubt we have created a system for the peaceful use 
of atomic energy, and we shall continue to do so.'' 
  ``However, the peaceful use of plutonium has become a topic 
of concern with the operation problems at THORP, England's 
reprocessing plant, and with the start of construction on the 
reprocessing plant at Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture. 
There is also the problem of dismantling Russia's nuclear 
arsenal. It is important that we strive to create a system to 
facilitate mutual understanding concerning the use of plutonium 
throughout the world.'' 
  Question: How do you think the international discussion over 
plutonium management will proceed? 
  Reply: ``Last year in December the IAEA invited seven 
nations--England, France, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the 
U.S.--to the first informal meeting on plutonium management, and 
a second informal meeting will be held this month. The positions 
of the various nations should become somewhat clearer at that 
time.'' 
  ``We ourselves do not think that the STA's international 
management plan will be the final product. The most important 
thing is that Japan should take a positive approach by 
presenting a proposal for international review. We want to make 
Japan's intentions clear.'' 
<H5>  U.S. Concerned About Surplus </H5>
  Question: How have various countries reacted to Japan's plan 
for plutonium management? 
  Reply: ``We have not reached the stage where specific 
feelings are clear. Basically, there is a common understanding 
that it is important to strive to increase openness in the use 
of plutonium, but when it comes to specific policies, we can 
expect a variety of opinions depending on the situation each 
country finds itself in.'' 
  ``For example, as we have learned in the nuclear 
non-proliferation policy announced by the U.S. government in 
September, the commercial use of plutonium will not be an option 
in the U.S., at least for the time being, and naturally we can 
expect the U.S. to take a strong position on preventing nuclear 
proliferation.'' 
  ``As far as Japan is concerned, the peaceful use of atomic 
energy is guaranteed within the framework of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. We will pursue both nuclear 
non-proliferation and the peaceful use of plutonium. It is 
important for Japan to increase our openness as seen from the 
outside so that the world will recognize we are using plutonium 
in a peaceful manner.'' 
  Question: We have heard that there is a good chance the U.S. 
will propose a plan with strong regulations for plutonium 
management. What do you think? 
  Reply: ``I think that is only natural, but the U.S. has a 
greater interest in the problem of excess plutonium.'' 
  Question: Some people say that Japan has presented a 
plutonium management plan as preparation for an excess of 
plutonium in the future. 
<H5>  Supply/Demand Balance Maintained </H5>
  Reply: ``I suppose there are people who are saying that, but 
we do not think so. We will maintain the balance between 
plutonium supply and demand to the end. Both the suppliers and 
the demanders may have their plans, but things do not always go 
according to plan. What is really important is carefully making 
plutonium and carefully using it all up rather than forcing some 
kind of delicate balance.''

<H5>  Perspective </H5>
<H5>  Alarm at Stronger U.S. Regulations </H5>
  Japan's peaceful use of atomic energy was made possible 
because of the nuclear non-proliferation system centered on the 
U.S. and former Soviet Union. This system is now in flux as 
Japan approaches the era of full-fledged use of plutonium. The 
reason Japan quickly put together a plutonium management plan 
was that the government decided it must strive to strengthen the 
nuclear non-proliferation system on its own. 
  Japan and the U.S. both have the same objectives in nuclear 
non-proliferation, but their situations are slightly different. 
The U.S., which has abandoned the commercial use of plutonium 
domestically, is leaning toward a policy that will add 
regulations to the use of plutonium. Japan is alarmed that those 
regulations will restrict her development of atomic energy. 
  In that respect, Japan's concept for international plutonium 
management sends a strong message to the U.S. It will be 
interesting to see how Japan forms ``alliances'' with England 
and France, countries that also use plutonium.

  [Text] On 19 November, Toshiba Corporation announced that 
by successfully making a product out of a freezer unit with 
cooling capability down to the temperature of liquid helium 
(absolute temperature 4.2K, or -269C), it had developed a 
small-scale superconducting magnet (see photo [omitted]) that 
does not use liquid helium. Until now, a niobium-titanium 
(Nb-Ti) superconducting magnet could not be used because direct 
cooling type freezers could not freeze below 10K. However, 
cooling down to 4.2K has become possible with the new freezer, 
and the size of the container also has been reduced to about 
one-third of existing units, so that a high magnetic field of 6 
tesla can be created in a large-diameter (internal diameter 18 
centimeters), normal temperature space. Toshiba claims that this 
will broaden substantially the sectors of commercial application 
of superconducting magnets. 
  The superconducting magnet system developed by Toshiba 
incorporates a small-scale freezer unit, which is a modification 
of the Gifford McMahon (GM) freezer that is used most widely 
today. Existing freezers could not cool below 10K, so it was 
necessary to use Nb[.sup]3[/], tin, etc., but on this 
occasion, cooling down to the 4K level was realized by such 
steps as finding magnetic material with high specific heat at 
temperatures below 10K for use as heat storing material. 
  In addition, an oxide superconductor, which has little heat 
conduction and feeds current even in strong magnetic fields, was 
used for the power lead through which current is fed to the 
superconducting coil, and this led to reduction of cooling 
temperature. 
  Because of this, it has become possible to realize a 
small-scale, high magnetic field with a Nb-Ti superconducting 
magnet, the most popular type that used to require liquid helium 
cooling, even by using a direct cooling type freezer. 
  The container that houses the magnet is 65 centimeters (cm) 
wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, as small as a 25 cm television, 
and use has been simplified to just switching on the freezer. 
  Toshiba maintains that almost all superconducting magnets 
for 
both industrial and research use can be used with this freezer, 
and that the process can be freed from the complicated liquid 
helium cooling method.

  [Text] On 19 November, the National Research Institute for 
Metals (NRIM) of the Science and Technology Agency announced the 
successful drawing of wire from an aluminum-lead-bismith-based 
superconducting ally that was produced in the space shuttle. 
Metals with differing specific gravities were the raw materials 
for producing, in the weightless environment of space, a 
superconducting alloy with uniform composition, and wire was 
drawn from this material after it had been recovered on earth. 
  Hopes had been placed on this alloy of aluminum, lead and 
bismuth for use in superconduction and vibration prevention. 
However, since the specific gravities of aluminum and lead are 
too disparate on the earth, attempts to produce a high-quality 
alloy have failed because the aluminum and lead separated into 
two layers. NRIM faced this challenge with the primary materials 
experiments conducted on the space shuttle Endeavor by astronaut 
Mori, and the alloy was produced in a weightless environment.

  [Text] A superconducting device is a device that uses 
superconductivity, in which electrical resistance is zero, and 
which is characterized by high-speed operation and small 
consumption of electric power. This project is a search for a 
three-terminal device using high-temperature superconductivity 
of oxides. The goal is to use superconductivity to realize 
transistor operations that are the foundation of electronic 
devices in use today. 
  Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corporation and Sumitomo Electric 
Industries are individually doing research on devices with 
compositions similar to field effective transistors (FET), which 
control current by voltage applied at the gates. 
  Hitachi and Toshiba are considering devices with a structure 
of a semiconductor or other normal conductor sandwiched between 
superconductors. When joined together, the surface of the normal 
conducting layer also becomes superconducting to some degree, 
and superconductive current is exuded. This is called a 
proximity effect. This effect is controlled by gate voltage or 
charge input, and switching is carried out. 
  Research is at the stage of joining superconductor and 
normal 
conductor, then doing a detailed study of the resulting 
performance. Hitachi is using a holmium-barium-copper oxide 
superconductor and a praseodymium-barium-copper oxide (PBCO) 
normal conductor, and is taking measurements at very low 
temperatures. It learned that the travel distance between the 
electron pair that carries superconducting current changes with 
voltage or temperature, and is conducting theoretical studies to 
explain this. 
  Toshiba is using yttrium-barium-copper oxide (YBCO) to 
sandwich a PBCO layer. It is measuring performance when the 
thickness of the PBCO layer is changed. It also is accumulating 
techniques for joining the layers, such as lining up crystalline 
orientation to make thin film. 
  Neither Hitachi nor Toshiba has realized operation of a 
three-terminal device. It is difficult to make high quality thin 
film from superconducting oxides, and, furthermore, fundamental 
points such as how thick the film should be to make a good 
device need to be discovered. 
  On the other hand, Sumitomo Electric Industries is not 
studying the proximity effect; it is researching a device that 
uses the superconductor itself as a channel (path for passing 
current). It is looking for optimum design conditions based on 
using YBCO for the superconductor, strontium titanic acid for 
the substrate and insulation, and gold for electrodes. 
  The three terminal device was produced experimentally, and 
experiments at extremely low temperatures confirmed that gate 
voltage transforms superconducting current. Degree of 
transformation is still too weak, but it is thought that 
improvements can be made by raising the quality of the film or 
making it thinner. 
<H5>  [5 Nov 93 p 4] </H5>
  A bipolar transistor is composed of three layers -- emitter, 
base and collector. The center part, the base, holds the key to 
performance. If resistance in this part is small, electrons flow 
rapidly and high-speed operations are possible. A team from Oki 
Electric's device technology laboratory produced an experimental 
model of a transistor using a superconductor for the base layer, 
and succeeded in amplifying current. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-61A>           Superconductivity </FIG>



  On top of a crystalline substrate of strontium titanate 
(STO) 
to which 0.1% niobium had been added, a thin film of 
barium-rubidium-bismuth oxide was layered, and then covered with 
a film of indium. the STO substrate is the emitter, the BRBO is 
the base and the indium is the collector. 
  BRBO beomes superconducting at absolute temperature 28 
(-245C), so it was cooled slightly below that, to 20 
(-253C) and then tested for operation. The current 
amplification factor was 0.94 (the closer to 1 the better) at 
base grounding and 10 (the bigger the better) at emitter 
grounding, the first time that practical levels were achieved by 
a superconducting transistor. 
  The thickness of the base layer was under 50 nanometers (1 
nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Although it is not easy 
to make flat thin film with oxide superconductors, this was 
achieved by free use of control technology in which the 
molecular beam epitaxy method was used to vaporize 
simultaneously four types of elements. Also, when indium was 
layered onto BRBO, a thin oxide film formed on the boundary 
surface, and it was found that this acted as a good link between 
the base layer and the collector layer. 
  measurement and evaluation of performance, such as operating 
speed and power consumption, are still to come. It is estimated 
that operating frequency of the experimental model is about 
10,000 hertz, but the goal is the high-speed operation of 1 
billion hertz. It would not be worth using superconductors if 
this performance level could not be achieved. The smaller the 
base the better for high-speed operation, and the device 
structure must be reduced from its present size of 0.5 
millimeters (mm) square to 5 microns (1 micron is .001mm) square 
in order to achieve this goal. 
  On the other hand, the Sanyo Electric Company also is doing 
research on the same type of device. The difference with the Oki 
Electric device is that a superconductor is used for the emitter 
layer as well and an insulator is set up as a barrier between 
this and the base layer to bring out sharpness. 
  A barium-potassium-bismuth oxide (BKBO) superconductor and 
gold are layered onto a substrate of STO to which neodymium has 
been added, and this is being used to confirm the basic 
operation of a three-terminal device. The important point is the 
insulation film between the BKBO and the gold. In the past, the 
oxide film which forms naturally was used, but Sanyo is trying 
to improve performance by artificially creating a thin film of 
magnesium oxide. 
<H5>  [8 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>
  Research also is proceeding on combining superconductivity 
with tunnels and other quantum effects. 
  The ``dielectric base transistor'' proposed by Fujitsu, Ltd. 
is one of those. As expressed by the name, this uses the 
superconductor STO for the base layer. The emitter and collector 
layers are YBCO superconductors. Instead of simply layering 
these three, thin interlayers made of other superconductors are 
sandwiched between the emitter and base, and the base and 
collector. 
  The purpose of adding interlayers is to create conditions 
for 
the resonant tunnel effect to occur and to bring out negative 
resistance and other special qualities. Normally, quantum 
devices have layers of compound semiconductor thin film, but in 
this case, the same kind of device will be designed with oxide 
thin film. Both the superconductor's very high-speed operation 
and low power consumption and the quantum effect's multi 
functionality are being sought, a very ambitious undertaking. 
  So far, a clear cut quantum effect has not been brought out, 
but a transistor with neodymium-gallium oxide interlayers was 
produced experimentally in FY90, and the basic operation of 
transformation of the current flowing from the emitter to the 
collector caused by the base layer's potential was confirmed at 
extremely low temperatures. 
  However, only a small current flowed between the emitter and 
the collector, even when strong voltage was applied, and the 
change in current also was slight. Of course, this is only 
natural since a dielectric, which does not pass electricity, is 
being used, but dielectric interlayers are essential in order to 
elicit the quantum effect. To solve this dilemma, the search has 
continued for materials that facilitate electron permeation and 
are compatible with YBCO. 
  Thin films of various types of oxides, such as 
lanthanum-aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, were sandwiched 
between STO and YBCO and tested for performance. It was found 
that the same voltage increased current by 2-3 digits when 
magnesium oxide was used. 
  With the latest test model, which has magnesium oxide thin 
film interlayers that are 1 nanometer thick (a billionth of a 
meter), current nearly at the practical level flowed when about 
10 volts were applied at extremely low temperatures. It has a 
long way to go when compared with a conventional transistor that 
operates with millivolt-level voltage, but it can be said that 
the shape of a usable device finally has come into view. 
  Whether the main goal of quantum effect can be elicited is a 
problem for the future. Oxides are even more difficult than 
compound semiconductors to laminate into thin film, and there is 
also little research history on this subject. The process of 
trial and error probably will continue in order to achieve the 
goal of developing a peerless new device. 
<H5>  [9 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>
  In an effort to combine superconductivity and quantum 
effect, 
the NEC basic research laboratory is proposing to make a single 
electron transistor (SET) with superconductors. 
  SET is a transistor that operates by controlling each 
electron individually. It is one of the devices of the future on 
which active research has intensified in recent years. When 
extremely tiny ``islands'' are made with semiconductors, a 
quantum effect called the coulomb blockade occurs, in which 
electrons jump individually, not in groups, from one island to 
the next. If memory or calculation functions are carried out 
with the movement of one electron, the device can be extremely 
small and consume almost no power. 
  What would be the advantage to combining this with 
superconductors? It is believed that this would improve 
operating speed, increase stability, etc., although there are no 
definite prospects for realizing these. With superconductors, 
two electrons form a pair to carry current. It would be 
extremely difficult to handle electrons individually, but a 
``single electron pair transistor,'' in which groups of electron 
pairs are controlled, may increase stability. 
  Of course, even the regular SET still is in the basic 
research stage, and it would not do to skip ahead to a 
superconducting SET. A team from NEC has made a tunnel junction 
of aluminum and alumina (aluminum oxide) and its first goal was 
to control a single electron in a normal conducting state. 
  A microstructure with 100 nanometer line width and 50 
nanometer square junction area was cooled to extremely low 
temperatures. One side was made the gate and electrons were fed 
into the electrode on the opposite side. The team was able to 
observe the change in potential that showed when each electron 
entered the electrode. In the future, the group plans to raise 
slightly the temperature at which experiments are conducted, 
make a junction with superconductors and accumulate basic data. 
  On the other hand, Mitsubishi Electric's basic semiconductor 
research laboratory is pursuing the possibility of a 
micro-vacuum tube that uses superconductivity. 
  Thanks to advances in microprocessing technology, it has 
become possible to use semiconductors to make small structures 
resembling vacuum tubes. Although large-scale vacuum tubes are 
anachronistic, micro-vacuum tubes are being looked at with 
renewed interest because it is thought that operating functions 
different from those of solid state components might be obtained 
if electrons are released from the surface of a semiconductor 
into a vacuum. 
  Mitsubishi Electric's goal is to make a tunnel junction with 
superconductor and insulator layers so that vitality-filled 
electrons are released sharply. As of now, basic studies are 
being carried out, such as on the conditions needed to produce 
high-quality, bismuth-based superconducting thin film surfaces 
and on the characteristics of the experimentally produced 
junctions. In the future, a micro-vacuum tube with the 
capability of large current switching may be produced.

<H3>  Current Approach to Consolidating Japan's Research 
Information Network </H3>
  28 October 1994 Research Information Network Forum Policy 
Committee, Council for Science &amp; Technology 
  1. The necessity for consolidating the foundations for 
R&amp;D 
such as networks, databases, etc., to promote the dissemination 
of research data, which has become increasingly important in 
recent years, has been repeatedly noted in Science &amp; 
Technology 
Council Report No. 18 (January 1992), Fundamental Principles of 
Science &amp; Technology Policy (revised April 1992), 
Administrative 
Inspection of Science &amp; Technology by the Management and 
Coordination Agency (June 1992) and the Main Guidelines for 
Promoting Science &amp; Technology in 1994 (June 1993). In 
response 
to this need, we have begun to take concrete measures for a 
far-ranging consolidation of the foundations of information 
dissemination such as computers, LANs, etc., in universities, 
national testing and research institutes, etc., through the 1993 
supplementary budget. 
  2. The Policy Committee, Council for Science &amp; 
Technology, 
decided to begin a Research Information Network Forum in July of 
this year because of this situation. Since that time this forum 
has studied present and future approaches to Japan's research 
information network with the goal of promoting the dissemination 
of research information and the shared utilization of computer 
resources among research organizations both at home and abroad. 
  3. Based on its studies up to the present, the forum has 
arrived at the following conclusions concerning the present 
situation. 
  (1) In recent years the use of electronic media in addition 
to printed material as a means of disseminating research 
information has rapidly increased with the development of data 
processing and telecommunications technology. 
  (2) In Japan networks are already used extensively in some 
research organizations that have actively promoted international 
research or have invited many researchers in from abroad, but 
their general utilization is insufficient. This is probably 
because past government policy did not focus sufficiently on 
this problem. 
  (3) Currently in Japan there are many research information 
networks run independently by researchers in addition to those 
affiliated with some government ministries and agencies (MOE, 
MAFF, MITI, etc.) However, the circuit speed is 0.5 Mbps 
maximum, which is about one-hundredth that in the U.S., and 
because the structure of the research information network that 
interconnects the research organizations of various ministries 
and agencies is grossly insufficient, the dissemination of many 
kinds of information between research organizations is so poor 
that Japan is currently lagging about 5-10 years behind the U.S. 
Moreover, there is a lack of technicians to operate the network, 
which places an excess burden on the researchers. 
  (4) This kind of delay in consolidating the research 
information network in Japan hinders the smooth and high-level 
dissemination of research information both in and out of Japan. 
Researchers and research-related persons recognize the lack of 
this foundation, which should naturally be available in an 
industrially advanced nation, and they strongly want the 
government to proceed with a comprehensive consolidation. As a 
nation, we must respond quickly. Moreover, there are strong 
demands from abroad for access to Japanese research data and 
research results via networks, and we must respond as well from 
an international perspective. 
  4. Based on the above situation, this forum believes it is 
appropriate for the time being to promote the consolidation of 
Japan's research information network from now on through the 
policies noted below. Moreover, this forum will continue to 
review various problems concerning mid- and long-term approaches 
to research information consolidation in the future. 
<H5>  Description </H5>
  1. It is necessary to strive for the rapid completion of a 
research information network that will link research 
organizations beyond boundaries separating various fields of 
research and ministries, agencies and nations. At the same time 
it is necessary to strive for consolidating, expanding and 
speeding up the various research information networks in each 
organization, ministry and agency. In so doing, it is essential 
that the types of information equipment be provided that will 
enable harmonious affiliations and cooperation among the various 
organizations, ministries and agencies. 
  2. In consolidating and operating the research information 
network, it is important to proceed even-handedly, neutrally, 
flexibly, and in a stable manner with the cooperation of the 
ministries and agencies and related individuals based on the 
purposes and actual situations of each existing research 
information network. Moreover, it is necessary to respond in a 
timely manner to user needs and rapid technological innovations 
while also making an attempt to minimize differences between 
various regions in terms of information dissemination. 
  3. It is necessary to promote research concerning basic 
utilization technology such as improving convenience, security 
control, etc., to achieve sophistication and promote use of the 
research information network, and it is necessary to promote 
research concerning network use in various fields. Moreover, it 
is necessary to conduct surveys and studies concerning ways that 
users can contribute, etc. It is also necessary to incorporate 
in good order into the research information network from now on 
the results of technical developments in hardware and software 
relevant to future ultra-high-speed networks. 
  4. In addition to consolidating the research information 
network, it is necessary to strive for active transmission and 
overall utilization of research information held at each 
research organization by promoting databases for research data 
and articles that can be disseminated via the network. 
  5. It is essential that we establish and maintain the 
individual morality of each researcher for the proper and 
positive use of the research information network. From the 
standpoint of maintaining security, it will be necessary to hold 
training sessions that will include those who provide the 
operating manuals and manage the network. It is also essential 
to acquire a professional staff and train personnel to operate 
the network. 
  6. As a nation it is essential that we fulfill our 
responsibility to the world in terms of information 
dissemination by linking our research information network to 
foreign countries and cooperating with foreign nations in 
information dissemination and cooperative research via this 
network. 
  7. In consolidating the research information network it is 
necessary that we proceed with followup policies with the goal 
of freely providing the research resources we have without 
monetary profit not only to Japanese researchers but to 
researchers around the world regardless of their affiliation.

<H3>  Establishing Interministry Research Information Network: 
Particulars </H3>
  1. In modern research and development, the need is 
increasing 
for research that cuts across the arbitrary lines between 
ministries and agencies, fields of research, and nations. We can 
expect a dramatic jump in R&amp;D sophistication by setting up a 
network among research organizations and promoting the 
transmission of graphics data and files in real time and the 
shared use of computers. In Europe and the U.S. there are 
already networks shared by research organizations. In the U.S. 
in particular there is already a high-speed (45 Mbps) network 
available. Furthermore, an ultra-high-speed network (several 
hundred Mbps or Gbps) coordination project (NREN) has already 
begun as part of the HPCC (High Performance Computing and 
Communications) Plan for developing an information foundation 
with the goal of increasing international competitive strength. 
  2. On the other hand, the foundations for information use 
between research organizations (intra-organization networks 
(LAN), computer equipment, etc.) are insufficient in Japan, and 
only low-speed networks (64-512 Kbps; a speed less than 1/100 of 
those in the U.S.) link various research organizations. 
Therefore, the dissemination of information and shared computer 
use not only among Japanese organizations but with those 
overseas as well has lagged behind, and discontent is growing 
both at home and abroad. 
  3. Moreover, it is necessary to manage data distributed via 
networks, but the various types of data reflecting research 
results from different organizations are not sufficiently 
organized nor unified. Because standardization has not 
proceeded, the data is not available for general, productive 
utilization and this hinders efficient R&amp;D. The advisory 
report 
(June 1992) based on the results of the Administrative 
Inspection of Science and Technology by the Management and 
Coordination Agency, recommends the consolidation of the 
information dissemination system as a corrective measure by 
putting data from national research institutes and national 
universities online. 
  4. The majority of researchers are strongly interested in 
setting up a trunk network (data, graphics, database searches, 
research condition guides, etc.) to be shared by ministries and 
agencies (from survey concerning research information network 
conducted November 1992 at 160 research organizations, national 
research institutes, etc.) 
  5. Various ministries and agencies are installing 
supercomputers and LANs with their 1993 supplementary budgets, 
and in the future we can expect the topic of an interministry 
network among organizations to come up. Moreover, the Main 
Guidelines for Promoting Science &amp; Technology in 1994 include 
``Consolidating the foundations for dissemination of research 
information'' as a major item. 
  6. As far as this network is concerned, has been approached 
in the following manner with the affiliation of the various 
ministries and agencies. 
  1. To conduct a study concerning a research information 
network in Japan in the future, we implemented a survey in June 
this year jointly with relevant ministries and agencies (STA, 
MOE, MITI, MPT) about how far the U.S. has progressed. 
  2. To review this issue in the Policy Committee of the 
Council for Science &amp; Technology, we are holding Research 
Information Network Forums (decision made on 22 July) and are 
proceeding with the cooperation of each ministry and agency. 
  7. Because of this situation, we will establish a ``System 
to 
Consolidate Research Information and Promote an Interministry 
Network'' beginning in 1994 with Adjustment Funds to Promote 
Science and Technology, and with the cooperation of each 
ministry and agency, we will strive to promote the setup and 
operation of an interministry research information network that 
will link national research organizations, etc., and to create 
databases of basic, fundamental data to be disseminated via this 
network.

<H3>  Main Guidelines for Promoting Science &amp; Technology in 
1994 </H3>
  24 June 1993 Policy Committee, Council for Science &amp; 
Technology 
  1. The Council for Science &amp; Technology made a report in 
January last year on the overall basic policy toward science and 
technology that should be taken as we approach a new century. 
The government received this report and in April last year 
revised the Fundamental Principles of Science &amp; Technology 
Policy. 
  Based on this report and the Fundamental Principles, Japan 
must develop a positive, comprehensive policy with the following 
three goals while continuing to emphasize the importance of its 
contribution to international society and the human race. 
  1. Mankind living in harmony with the earth. 
  2. Expansion of our stock of knowledge. 
  3. Construction of a safe, abundant society to live in. 
  2. In order to attain this goal it will be necessary for the 
government to play a greater role of central leadership than in 
the past. It will be particularly important for the government 
to strengthen its activities dramatically through the diverse 
and important roles performed by universities, national research 
organizations and special corporations that conduct research. 
  3. In 1994 we must strive to promote R&amp;D in the major 
fields 
indicated in the Fundamental Principles of Science &amp; 
Technology 
Policy, support basic science, and pay attention to promoting 
regional science and technology as well as build an emphatic and 
effective policy for promoting science and technology based on 
the items noted below. 
  More specifically, we must keep in mind that setting up a 
foundation for the promotion of science and technology is a 
basic condition for the expansion Japan's economy and society 
while we strive to realize a society in which the citizenry 
truly feels abundance and leisure as we head toward the 21st 
Century. 
<H5>  Major Points </H5>

  - 
  -  By expanding research funds to promote basic research, 
raising the level of research, renewing facilities and equipment 
that have become outdated, and setting up sufficient facilities 
and equipment for consolidation of the foundations to 
disseminate research information, we will create a core research 
capability and strive to strengthen the foundations for R&amp;D 
conducted in universities and national research institutes and 
to improve the research environment. 
  -  We will strive to increase 
both the quality and quantity of the people who conduct science 
and technology activities by improving and expanding the 
personnel at universities and national research organizations. 
  -  We will strengthen international science and technology 
activities by actively promoting international joint R&amp;D, and 
improving and expanding our science and technology cooperation 
with developing nations. 
<H3>  Consolidation of Research Information Network and Basic, 
Fundamental Data </H3>
  It is important to raise the level of the R&amp;D 
environment at 
national research organizations and announce research results 
both domestically and abroad. 

  -  Promotion of consolidated, high-level interministry 
research information network to link Japan's research 
organizations beyond the boundaries of organizations, ministries 
and agencies, and nations. 
  Research Information Network 
  1. Communication by electronic mail, bulletin boards, etc. 
  2. High speed transfer of files and remote searching of 
databases. 
  3. Shared use of computers (super computers, etc.) 

  -  Promotion of creating databases of basic, fundamental data 
necessary for the advancement of research activities with the 
cooperation of many organizations. 
  DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH INFORMATION, PROMOTION OF JOINT 
RESEARCH, CREATION OF RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
RESULTS AT HOME AND ABROAD 
  Letters, numbers, spreadsheets, graphics, audio, etc. 
  (Physics, chemistry, life sciences, materials science, 
global 
environment studies, etc.) 
  The Interministry Research Information Network will be 
comprised of intra-ministry and intra-agency national research 
organization networks, national research organizations, special 
corporations, etc., and domestic networks, and it will be linked 
to foreign networks. 
  Specific Measures 
  1. System To Consolidate Research Information and Promote 
Interministry Network: (Total of 1.1 billion yen from Science 
and Technology Promotion Coordination Expenditures) 
  System to consolidate research information and to promote of 
interministry network. 
  Promotion of Interministry Network--Studies of basic 
technology for utilization and applications to contribute to the 
genuine consolidation and operation of an interministry network

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuhisa Yamagiwa, editorial staff] </F>
  [Text] In its Patent Gazette, the Patent Office addressed 
the issue of whether mathematics can be patented, an issue which 
received attention with the U.S. company AT&amp;T's optimal 
resource 
allocation formula. A patent for the mathematics itself was 
turned down, but when AT&amp;T appealed, it succeeded in 
convincing 
three judges. 
  The optimal resource allocation formula is a kind of 
mathematical solution for linear programming formulas. It is 
called the Kamakar formula because it was developed by Nahrendra 
Kamakar, Ph.D., of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. In 1988 it gained 
three U.S. patents for solutions more than one hundred times 
faster than before. 
  The Kamakar formula was developed to get the most rational 
response when complex conditions apply. It is extremely 
effective insofar as it can be applied to large systems. It can 
be used for making airline passenger schedules, moving troops to 
many fronts, or production management. 
  A Japanese patent was applied for in 1986 and the Patent 
Office denied it in 1991. AT&amp;T appealed and twice rewrote the 
patent application claim that is now public. 
  When the claim was rewritten it became more precise compared 
to the U.S. patent. Upon reading the Patent Gazette it is 
roughly possible to write a program, and the application claim 
is clearer. 
  However, the judges probably couldn't help but think about 
U.S.-Japan friction over technology. The U.S. government would 
demand an explanation if something that was approved as a U.S. 
patent were not approved in Japan. Accordingly, if no objections 
are made within three months the Kamakar formula will patented. 
  In 1989 AT&amp;T created a product called KORBX which 
incorporates the Kamakar formula. It was a very expensive system 
costing $8.9 million for the software on a special computer. 
After that XMP, a U.S. software company, began selling OB1 
software which solves more than ten times faster for about $500. 
Since then KORBX has completely stopped selling. 
  Although specialists generally believe that OB1 does not 
infringe on the Kamakar patents, AT&amp;T accused XMP of patent 
infringement and succeeded in winning a five percent share of 
OB1's earnings. ``Sales might be banned while the matter went to 
court and the court costs would be high,'' explained XMP. 
  AT&amp;T has already given up on selling products related 
to the 
Kamakar formula, so what is its motive in going after a Japanese 
patent? It appears AT&amp;T wants patent use fees from software 
using solutions similar to the Kamakar formula. 
  ``We are preparing an objection,'' said Professor Hiroshi 
Konno of Tokyo Industrial University's engineering faculty. 
``The Kamakar formula isn't appropriate for a patent. It lacks 
novelty since it closely resembles formulas developed twenty 
years earlier by researchers in the former Soviet Union. It's 
basically mathematics and if it's patented it will prevent 
scholarly development,'' said Konno. 
  Even in the U.S. which has strengthened the protection of 
intellectual property is seeing a movement to reconsider. Fair 
judgments from the Patent Office would help keep the patent 
system from being a tool only for exercising rights.

  [Text] If a seed of technology released by a large 
corporation were picked up by a small-medium company and 
blossomed into a large flower.... Japan Technomart Foundation 
(Katsushige Mita, chairman) was established in 1985 with the 
goal of nurturing in Japan a true ``technology marketplace.'' 
However, with a corporate membership of 300 companies and 
10,000 items of registered information, it has only achieved one 
to two-fifths of the goals set for it by MITI, its starter. Why 
has its challenge to new business opportunities as a high tech 
intermediary languished? 
<H5>  Problems with Methods Used </H5>
  ``Am I [i.e.Technomart] considered necessary by industry?'' 
This question has been repeated during Japan Technomart's eight 
years of existence. The foundation sells distinctive ``sell'' 
and ``buy'' information using a database. However, of the 
currently registered patents, no more than 3,000 are sells and 
no more than 150 are buys. ``Since there are such small absolute 
numbers, such as ten patents related to semiconductors and three 
related to portable phones, the number of opportunities for 
corporate matchmaking just doesn't increase,'' according to 
Katsutaka Shibata, managing director. 
  There's also a problem of quality. Large companies, small 
companies, big city companies, and local companies without 
distinction bring existing technologies and nurture the buds of 
new businesses. There are voices contradicting that kind of 
ideal. ``Our company will use money-making patents. If there's 
technology that will quickly turn into money we'd like to 
acquire it cheaply from another company,'' curse corporate egos. 
``The content of technical information is causing `hollowing','' 
says an electrical manufacturer. 
  ``Exchange of technical information for invigorating 
industry 
is not lacking. Technomart's business will bear fruit,'' asserts 
Patent Office ``old boy'' Shibata. Tadakata Homma, head of 
Mitsubishi Electric's intellectual property liaison division, 
has a positive assessment: ``There is the significance of 
introducing the advanced technology of large corporations to 
local corporations.'' ``The problem is that we haven't found a 
reliable method of getting results through an intermediary,'' 
says Shibata. 
  The fee structure remains the same as when Technomart was 
founded: &yen;3 million to join and annual dues of &yen;3 
million. Even so, membership has fallen to half of its peak 
number amid complaints that members don't get their money's 
worth. There's frustration in the executive offices that 
Technomart, which got off to such a glorious start as the 
``curtain opener on the technology information age,'' has 
achieved the real results promised in only 330 cases. 
<H5>  Pluses </H5>
  Managing Director Shibata has made up his mind, ``Although 
it 
seems like a circuitous route, we have no choice other than to 
slowly but surely enlighten people.'' A mainstay of this effort 
is the ``EasyPat'' rights information service started in August 
1993. It offers easy personal computer-based searching of the 
1.2 million patent and utility models registered in the Patent 
Office. 
  EasyPat is no match for PATOLIS (offered by the Japan Patent 
Information Organization) database which prides itself on more 
than ten million items of industrial rights information. But, 
``if you're investigating patents under registration, its size 
is convenient. PATOLIS charges &yen;300 per minute of searching, 
while EasyPat charges &yen;300 per item. Another advantage is 
being able to take time to search thoroughly,'' says EasyPat's 
enthusiastic PR. 
  Even if a technology transaction occurs as the result of an 
EasyPat search, Technomart can't charge a fee for serving as an 
intermediary. ``The board of directors debated going so far as 
to spend labor and time,'' said Shibata. However, the majority 
believed that getting corporations to acknowledge Technomart's 
existence and role came first. 
  Since April each branch has one technical information 
advisor. Once every two months they gather in Tokyo to hold an 
information exchange meeting. They uncover unique technologies 
in the provinces and also take information back to introduce to 
managers of local industry in their region. 
<H5>  Even One Case </H5>
  ``We call on our branches to work for success in business 
negotiations. Even just one case is fine,'' says Shibata. It 
will be a start toward a ``second beginning'' when staff members 
recover pride in their work. Although companies are enduring 
cost cutting, there are more and more people wondering if the 
companies could make more effective use of their intellectual 
property. ``At any moment the long recession may blow over,'' 
murmured Shibata as if trying to get himself to agree.

  [Text] With the implementation of the new utility model law 
coming in January 1994, the Japan Institute of Invention and 
Innovation (JIII; Eiji Toyoda, chairman) has begun in earnest 
the work of the Intellectual Property Technology Rating Center). 
In conjunction with the shift to a no-examination system, the 
Center will investigate technology preceding the technology 
scheduled for patent application, will judge its appropriateness 
for registration, and will try to prevent futile applications. 
This service is aimed at small-medium sized companies and 
individual inventors. As it begins the service it has published 
guidelines for research method and application procedures. 
  Since under the new utility model law there will be 
registration without ``substantial examination'', registerable 
ideas won't be limited as under the old law to ideas with 
novelty or improvements. Under the new law when a utility model 
right is exercised there is a duty to inform the other party 
with a ``technology rating document'' created by the Patent 
Office. 
  In order to investigate issues such as whether the same 
items 
have appeared in an earlier patent application or if the 
application includes an unregisterable portion and in order to 
participate in the application process, the Center provides 
accurate rating materials through research on preceding 
technology for the items on which the small-medium sized 
companies or individual inventors plan to apply. 
  Specifically, it uses the PATOLIS on-line patent information 
database system to focus its search for five items of related 
preceding technology in patents or utility models. In 
conjunction with this, it presents to the requester a report 
describing the scope of technology from the previous fifty years 
which was listed in the on-line database and which seems to 
belong to the category being investigated. 
  Items for which research can be requested include those 
which 
can be implemented immediately after application and those which 
are not at the idea level but for which effectiveness and 
structure for implementation are clear. As a rule, applications 
are made through the JIII's regional branches or through the 
region's chamber of commerce or commerce and industry 
association.

  [Text] When alighting from the west exit of the San'in main 
line a few minutes from the JR Kyoto train station, fancy glass 
buildings attract the eye. Construction is proceeding on Kyoto 
Research Park (KRP, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto) where once stood a line of 
gas tanks belonging to the Kyoto plant of Osaka Gas. KRP is 
attracting attention as the ``heart'' of the ``brain city.'' 
  KRP is a city-type research park of national prominence on 
the scale of Kanagawa Science Park (KSP, total floor area 
approximately 150,000 square meters) in Kawasaki City. Its 
eastern area (total floor area 48,000 square meters) opened in 
October 1989 as its first phase. 
  About fifty organizations are located and active in the 
eastern area, in addition to the main business entity fully 
funded by Osaka Gas. These include institutions performing 
contract research in software and mechatronics, Kyoto Higher 
Technology Research Institute and Kyoto Prefecture Small and 
Medium-Sized Industry Center, and laboratories of high tech and 
start-up companies. The central area is currently under 
construction for rental research space, hotels, and convention 
facilities. When it is completed in 1997, total floor area will 
be 250,000 square meters, making it the largest in Japan. 
  While Kyoto is a mecca for traditional arts such as Nishijin 
textiles and Kiyomizu pottery, it has also produced many 
prominent high-tech and start-up companies such as Kyocera, 
Omron, and Rohm. Since factors such as rising land prices have 
made corporate start-ups more difficult, KRP is emphasizing its 
role as an incubator for R&amp;D-based industries by putting 
effort 
into strengthening capacity for doing research in rented 
facilities. 
  It's not just a matter of gathering research institutions. 
``We would like to offer many capabilities such as 
industry-academia exchange, business matchmaking at a global 
level, and even consulting on foreign companies' entry into 
Japan and on foreign research parks,'' says Hiroshi Endo, 
president of KRP. 
  The International Technology Exchange Center (ITEC) which is 
scheduled to be set up in the central area in Spring 1994 will 
be the first in Japan to specialize in supporting world-scale 
joint ventures and market development. Tenants will include 
full-scale venture capital firms, firms that manage databases of 
intellectual and industrial property rights, and consulting 
companies. 
  KRP will also be active in an international network of 22 
research parks formed upon KRP's initiative. A personal computer 
network is being set up for the mutual exchange of information 
on the world's high technology and high tech companies. KRP 
plans to hold an international research part conference in Kyoto 
on the park's fifth anniversary in spring 1994 which will be a 
leading event of the 1200th anniversary of the founding of 
Kyoto. The goal of the event is to exchange information on 
research park management, world market trends, and technology. 
Participation from research parks in Europe and the U.S. is 
currently being sought.

Development Foundation 
  [Text] Toyama prefecture, which is endowed with good water 
and inexpensive electric power, has the greatest concentration 
of industry, mostly in industries using basic materials, on the 
Japan Sea. However, in the interests of planning for developing 
structure for high technology industry in the twenty-first 
century, in 1976 the Toyama Technology Promotion Association was 
founded for the diffusion of high technology to and support of 
R&amp;D by medium and small to medium-sized companies. 
  The Association mainly assisted technical development and 
did 
research. It attracted attention from across Japan since there 
weren't many such local third-sector support organizations 
focusing on medium and small to medium-sized companies. 
  The Association was reorganized and re-named the Toyama 
Technology Development Foundation in 1983 when Toyama was named 
one of the first eight technopolises under the Law for 
Accelerating Regional Development Based Upon High Technology 
Complexes (Technopolis Law) which aimed to create new cities in 
which industry, academia, and residents would coordinate their 
efforts. 
  The Foundation uses the Toyama Technology Exchange Center 
constructed in 1985 as its base of operations. This year it will 
celebrate its tenth anniversary with ceremonies and 
commemorative lectures to which Tsukuba University president 
Reona Esaki is invited. Activities focus in three areas: 
technology development, personnel development, and technology 
exchange. An industrial design center has been established, so 
the Foundation is also cooperating in promoting design 
development activities. 
  Technology development includes technical research aid 
activities in which grants of up to one-third of research costs 
(to a maximum of &yen;10 million) are given to medium and small 
to medium-sized companies for advanced technology research for 
new technologies or new products. These subsidies are paid upon 
successful completion. Since their inauguration in 1976, 84 
grants have been made. 
  One recent example of success: a precision machinery 
manufacturer developed an automatic punching planter for 
shiitake mushrooms which has received favorable response in 
sales throughout Japan. 
  In the area of personnel development, the Foundation 
conducts 
training for corporate technicians on topics such as ``Training 
for High Technology Staff'' and ``High-Tech Seminar'' and also 
trains managers in order to assure the nurturing and retention 
of personnel who will be outstanding in dealing with high 
technology. It also conducts study meetings every Monday on 
product development methods. It also holds student field trips 
to corporations and provides employment counseling to promote 
college student hiring within the prefecture. 
  In the area of technology exchange, the Foundation tries to 
improve corporate management resources and technology strengths 
by carrying out exchanges between different industries, 
industry-academia-government exchanges, and exchanges with 
advanced regions. 
  The Manager-Researcher Exchange Forum is an annual event 
held 
since 1987 at Toyama University's engineering faculty in 
cooperation with the University's Regional Cooperative Research 
Center. Participants number more than two hundred. It has become 
a model for alliances between regional cooperative research 
centers and regional foundations established later. 
  The Toyama Technology Exchange Club which is run on a 
membership basis holds monthly seminars focused on central 
lecturers to promote the members' mutual studies as well as 
cooperative research and market development. The Toyama 
Industrial Design Center was established in 1985 to plan for the 
improvement of design development capabilities among small to 
medium-sized companies. The Center is mainly active in education 
and training, design exchange, development support, and 
dissemination of information. 
  The Center holds a monthly Night Forum which expands 
designers' circles and which has met 60 times. Information 
dissemination includes many events in which designers 
participate, such as the 1992 International Craft Festival which 
drew 33 participants from 16 countries. These build the appeal 
of Toyama as a prefecture which supports design. 
  Beginning 1 December 1993, a design conference and various 
other design events will be held at Design Wave to show Toyama's 
appeal as a place from where design information is disseminated. 
  Ten years of the Technopolis plan have also passed. It's the 
second stage now. Now the goal is to use the soil that has been 
cultivated by the technician training and technology exchange 
that has already occurred to support further exchanges between 
industry and academia and between different industries and to 
raise technology to the level appropriate to the Toyama 
technopolis.

  [Text] In April 1993 the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) 
announced ``Antimonopoly Guidelines on Joint R&amp;D.'' When 
corporations can correctly understand the import of these 
guidelines for an area that was previously ambiguous, they can 
be at ease as they carry out joint work. However, they may get 
into unforeseen trouble if they don't pay careful attention to 
issues such as the total market share of the participating 
members or to deciding how the research results are used. 
  In July 1993 ten VTR manufacturers including Sony, 
Matsushita 
Electric, and Philips of the Netherlands announced their 
proposal for an international unified standard for consumer 
digital VTRs. It is not determined that the ten manufacturers 
will aggressively develop products using this standard. However, 
it appears that, insofar as leading manufacturers have lined up 
behind this standard, if a manufacturer developed other 
specifications it would be at a disadvantage. Creation of this 
kind of de facto industry standard is a kind of joint 
development, but would it fall under antimonopoly law? 
<H5>  Judging on ``Rationality'' </H5>
  The JFTC says ``in principle, OK'' under the current 
guidelines when it deems that technological innovations 
encourage competition. The background to this includes the 
merging of computer and consumer electronics technology, 
increasing joint R&amp;D, and and European and American 
antimonopoly 
policy. 
  Auto parts development conducted by American auto companies 
in the 1960s and 1970s in response to auto emissions regulations 
was a victim of antimonopoly policy. However, when the Joint 
R&amp;D 
Law was enforced in 1984 with the aim of improving corporate 
competitiveness, not all joint R&amp;D was under suspicion. 
Instead 
it was judged by the ``principal of logic.'' In 1984 in the EC 
also antimonopoly law application was softened with regard to 
R&amp;D. The world is shifting from strict application of 
antimonopoly law to emphasizing competitiveness. 
  Corporations must keep in mind that this is limited to that 
which is actually linked to competitiveness in the market. 
Selection of participants and research themes, rights granted in 
development contracts, the technology that is developed, and the 
products that use that technology are points to consider. 
However, the most important point is the line-up of members. 
<H5>  Access is Condition </H5>
  If the combined share in the direct market of the members of 
a joint research project is 20% or less, then there is no 
problem even if the members are rivals. Even when share exceeds 
20%, a decision will be reached by looking at the overall 
character of the research and of the need for the research. A 
project supported by the government won't necessarily be 
overlooked, while there's little likelihood of problems with a 
topic such as environmental policy which is clearly too 
difficult for one company by itself. 
  In the case of de facto industry standards, ``there's no 
problem if assuring compatibility will benefit consumers,'' 
according to Kenji Kawakoshi, attorney. However, the conditions 
are that the use of other standards cannot be restricted, others 
who aren't original members can participate in making the 
standards if they desire, and there must be access to the 
completed standards. 
  In the case of digital VTRs, a conference was set up to 
consider specifications for HDTV. Any company could apply to the 
secretariat, pay a membership fee, and then participate in 
drafting the standards. If the company became a member of the 
working group it could cast a vote on deciding the final 
specifications. The final specifications are public information. 
The secretariat says, ``we explained the conference to the 
JFTC,'' so concern was shown for the transparency of procedures. 
  When the total market share of the members is high, then 
naturally the way in which the development contract determines 
price and sales territory for products based on joint 
development is an issue. ``To avoid suspicion, it is better not 
to decide by contract which items members will discuss nor to 
exchange information on market competitiveness,'' advises 
attorney Yoshikazu Takaishi. 
  However, development results are to be protected by 
intellectual property rights for patents or know-how. Legal 
experts say this point has been clarified by the guidelines. For 
example, with an eye to avoiding disputes over rights, it has 
been decided that there will be no problem if limitations are 
placed on members doing joint development with other companies 
on the same theme for a logically fixed period of time after 
completion of the original joint development project. 
  Conditional Access Technology (Coatech) Research Institute, 
which developed a method for encrypting pay broadcasts, did not 
disclose technical information about the three key integrated 
circuits until March 1993. Coatech was established jointly as a 
specially licensed basic technology research promotion center by 
NHK, Japan Satellite Broadcasting, Toshiba, Matsushita Electric, 
and NEC. Manufacturers who were not members had to buy an IC 
unit in order to manufacture signal decoders. 
<H5>  Emphasis on Individual Judgment </H5>
  To the extent that encryption is a technology that allows 
only subscribers to see broadcasts, there is a reason to 
maintain secrecy. However, non-participant manufacturers want to 
manufacture from the IC stage to lower costs. In fact, only the 
three participating manufacturers have produced decoders since 
1991, even after JSB began pay broadcasts. Coatech arranged to 
maintain secrecy by disclosing information on only two of the 
integrated circuits. Two audio-visual manufacturers had already 
received permission. 
  The JFTC has now set up an advance consultation system for 
joint development. ``If we say it is legal, no legal action will 
be taken as long as that is not withdrawn,'' says Hidekatsu 
Hirabayashi, regulation section chief in the JFTC's economics 
division. However, Shozo Obune, advisor to the Sanwa Research 
Institute which proposed clarification of policy on joint 
R&amp;D to 
the JFTC's study group, emphasized that ``corporations should 
exercise their own judgment since the effort has been put into 
publishing the guidelines.'' 
  To avoid problems, it is a good idea to report to the JFTC 
ahead of time and to report outside on the nature of joint work. 
However, joint R&amp;D is an area of great strategic importance. 
There will probably always be cases of joint R&amp;D that will 
not 
surface. There is no need to fear antimonopoly law excessively 
if a company takes advantage of the guidelines' clarification to 
set up a structure so that corporation's own research and legal 
departments regularly engage in frank exchange of information. 
<H3>  Items and Excerpts from ``Antimonopoly Guidelines on Joint 
R&amp;D'' </H3>
  Implementation of Joint R&amp;D 
  1) Items which are recognized in principle as not coming 
under unfair methods of trade (terms for innocence): imposing 
requirement that necessary technical and other information be 
disclosed to participants, imposing requirement that secrecy be 
maintained regarding technical and other information disclosed 
by other participants, limiting appropriation of technology etc. 
disclosed by other participants for purposes other than the 
joint R&amp;D project, limiting individual R&amp;D and R&amp;D 
with third 
parties on the joint research theme during the term of the joint 
R&amp;D. 
  2) Items which may be considered as coming under unfair 
methods of trade (terms for gray areas): exceeding the scope 
necessary for preventing appropriation of technology etc. and 
limiting the use -- for purposes outside the joint R&amp;D theme 
-- 
of technology etc. disclosed by other participants, exceeding 
the scope necessary for implementing joint R&amp;D and limiting 
the 
introduction of the same kind of technology from other sources. 
  3) Items which are extremely likely to be considered as 
coming under unfair methods of trade (terms for guilt): limiting 
R&amp;D on themes other than the joint R&amp;D research theme, 
limiting 
production or sales by participants of competing products other 
than those based on joint R&amp;D results. 
  Products Using Technology Resulting From Joint R&amp;D 
  1) Terms for innocence Requiring a minimum level of quality 
or maintenance of standards necessary to assure the 
effectiveness of the resultant technology when a supply of 
products based on the research is procured from other 
participants in the R&amp;D 
  2) Terms for gray areas Limiting the production or sales 
region of products based on the research, limiting the 
production or sales quantity of products based on the R&amp;D. 
  3) Terms for Guilt 
  Limiting the price at which the products based on the 
R&amp;D can 
be sold to third parties.

  [Text] In November Saitama University will establish a 
forum for representatives of six Saitama engineering schools, 
including the engineering faculty and science laboratory of 
Saitama University, and three Kohsetsushi research institutes. 
The goals of the forum are to discuss policies for promoting 
industry in Saitama as prefectural industry becomes more 
advanced and to seek methods by which the prefecture's research 
institutions and companies can cooperate. Beginning in FY94 the 
prefecture plans to make the research results of prefectural 
universities available through the research institutes so that 
the prefecture's companies can develop them. It will 
aggressively promote exchange between industry, academia, and 
government on industrial technology. 
  Participants in the forum will include six schools: Saitama 
University's engineering faculty (Urawa), Saitama Institute of 
Technology (Okabe-machi, Osato-gun), Shibaura Institute of 
Technology (Omiya), Tokyo Denki University (Hatoyama-machi, 
Hiki-gun), Toyo University engineering faculty (Kawakoshi), and 
Nippon Institute of Technology (Miyashiro-machi, Nishi 
Saitama-gun). In addition, it will include bodies under the 
jurisdiction of the Science and Technology Agency (STA): 
National Space Development Agency's Earth Observation Center 
(Hatoyama-machi, Hiki-gun), Institute of Physical and Chemical 
Research (Wako), and Research Development Corporation of Japan. 
  In addition to fostering mutual understanding and 
cooperation 
between universities and research institutes based in Saitama, 
the forum will collect a broad range of opinions related to 
Saitama's future industrial promotion policies. Some of the 
broad topics they will discuss: 
  1) policies for cooperation between the prefecture's 
engineering schools, kohsetsushi institutes, and small to medium 
sized companies; 
  2) applications and utilization of research results by small 
to medium sized companies; 
  3) policies for administrative support of increasing 
exchange 
between industry, academia, and government. 
  Regular meetings are planned at the rate of two per year 
beginning in FY 1994. 
  Until now the separate efforts of sections -- such as the 
industry, academia, and government section and the industrial 
promotion section -- of the industry division have promoted 
cooperation among the research institutes' professors and 
researchers. In FY 1992-1993 approximately 40 members 
participated in study groups on joint research between industry, 
academia, and government and on the investigation delivering 
grants and ventures given grants. 
  It is thought that the start of the forum will strengthen 
cooperative links between the prefecture's universities and 
research institutes.

  On 10 November, completion ceremonies will be carried out 
for the headquarters laboratory of the Research Institute of 
Innovative Technologies for the Earth (RITE) in the Kansai 
Science City (Otsu-machi, Kyoto Prefecture). The Institute aims 
to do R&amp;D on technology useful for resolving environmental 
problems and to contribute to the world through environmental 
technology. This newspaper questioned Tsutomu Yamaguchi, 
managing director of RITE, about its goals. 
  -- This is the real beginning of RITE's activities, isn't 
it? 
  -- RITE is a key institution for developing revolutionary 
environmental technology for implementing the ``Earth 
Revitalization Plan'' (plan for comprehensive development of new 
energy technology and other earth conservation technologies). 
This is the only industry-government-academia partnership to 
grapple with these issues. We have a grave responsibility. 
  -- What will be the focus of RITE's research? 
  -- RITE will tackle three areas of fundamental research. 
Five 
researchers have been hired for five years on the annual salary 
[nembo] system. First, in the area of biology, RITE will do 
things such as using genetics to create plants that can be grown 
in deserts and searching for microorganisms which fix carbon 
dioxide, the cause of the earth's warming. 
  In the area of chemistry, research will be conducted on 
topics such as developing catalysts that can remove hydrogen 
from water, developing a computer system that can design 
catalysts, and using a high polymer film to separate hydrogen 
dioxide. In the systems area, research will be conducted on 
using computers to evaluate technology for fixing carbon dioxide 
and for putting a price tag on environmental pollution. 
  -- Internationalism will be another mainstay of RITE, won't 
it? 
  -- RITE will take an international perspective on forming a 
network [for research cooperation]. There are plans to invite 
researchers from the Institute for International Applications 
Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna to come as senior researchers 
for two months. They'll be the vanguard. In the future we want 
to have regular research exchanges between the two institutes. 
  There is currently a Russian scientist on the catalyst 
research team. The chief researcher in the systems area is a 
Japanese who is concurrently an associate professor at Harvard 
University. An Italian chemical company is participating in the 
hydrogen production project and we're sounding out a large 
French chemical company on the possibility of research exchange 
on the fixing project. 
  -- What method will be used for receiving the foreign 
countries? 
  -- We're aiming to be an internationally open research 
institute. Research has no meaning if it is not actually used. 
Since it's no good if Japan goes by itself, international 
participation is being sought from the R&amp;D stage. 
  Foreign countries simultaneously feel impressed and fearful 
about Japan's industry-government-academia effort in 
environmental technology. America and Europe fear that Japan 
will monopolize environmental technology. But it's also true 
that no country other than Japan is pursuing the same vision. 
RITE is calling for the countries of America and Europe to open 
their minds to participation. 
  -- Why will many corporations participate in projects to 
develop environmental technology? 
  -- That is because environmental problems are a constraint 
on 
growth, so corporations can't survive if they don't consider the 
environment. However, it's a basic truth that most companies 
pursue environmental research by themselves. The national 
project has to get by with a small contribution from industry. 
The results will be owned by its funders, the New Energy and 
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and RITE. 
However, patents can be transferred to corporations according to 
a stipulation providing for return in the event that the 
research results are not used within a set period. This is to 
provide an incentive for corporations to participate. 
<H5>  Viewpoint: Topic of Networking Research </H5>
  The cities of Yokkaichi in Mie prefecture, Munekata in 
Fukuoka prefecture, and others tried to attract RITE, but, due 
to the active efforts of its business community, the Kansai area 
won RITE's headquarters headquarter for the Kansai Science City. 
It is hoped that RITE will become the core facility of the city. 
  RITE was established in 1990 and has already spent three 
years working on projects entrusted to it by NEDO. These include 
carbon dioxide fixing, biodegradable plastic, and others. 
Research sites for carrying out research are scattered around 
the country among participating corporations and national 
research institutes. 
  Only 30 of the approximately 400 researchers connected to 
RITE will go the headquarters to conduct fundamental research 
and to work on the environmental catalyst project. There will 
probably be discussion of linking the scattered research sites 
in a network.

  [Text] Mitsui &amp; Co. (Naohiko Kumagai, president) will 
offer 
patent information services. It has developed KISPAT, a patent 
information service system using ISDN. It will begin a gazatte 
of patent applications in December and a patent announcement 
service in April 1994. This is related to the Patent Office's 
allowing re-publishing of its patent applications gazette as of 
January 1993 and its patent announcements as of January 1994. 
  Kokusai Information Services, a joint venture between Mitsui 
and the telephone company KDD, will sell the database services. 
It will be the first patent database transmission service using 
ISDN in Japan. Most users of patent information only need about 
one to two percent of the available patent information. The 
Patent Office's CD-ROM includes much unnecessary information and 
time is needed to find the necessary information. Under the new 
system, the necessary information will be entered two days after 
the publication of the CD-ROM at one-third the cost. Moreover, 
not just the patent division, but also laboratories and 
individuals can access the original database from a PC. 
  Japan is a ``patent kingdom.'' Our annual total of more than 
500,000 patent and utility model applications make up about 
40% 
of the world's total. 
  The Patent Office has already been moving toward eliminating 
paper. In October 1992 it accepted the report of the information 
subcommittee of the Patent Office's Industrial Property Council 
and it began electronic publishing in CD-ROM form in January 
1993 as well as allowing re-publishing of the electronic gazette. 
  Mitsui decided this was a promising business, so it began 
developing a new system. The service will begin in December with 
the patent gazette which publishes patents one and a half years 
after application. In April 1994, following the Patent Office's 
permission granted as of January 1994, it will add the patent 
announcements which appear three months before a patent is 
granted.

  [Text] Mitsui Shipbuilding and Engineering (Jiro Hoshino, 
president) is intensifying its search for strategic alliances in 
new businesses in the United States. Mitsui's Global Tech, a 
U.S. corporation, has already invested in a genetic engineering 
firm. With the move of Global Tech's headquarters to Washington, 
D.C., Mitsui plans to ally with U.S. companies in fields such as 
environmental technology and cooling systems. 
  Three years ago Mitsui set up Global Tech in the United 
States, then created Rio Grande Development (Albuquerque, New 
Mexico) as a joint venture with BDM International, a leading 
Defense Department contractor known for its automotive airbag 
manufacturing. Rio Grande invests in start-up companies and 
helps them even with tasks such product development. 
  Rio Grande has shown results by investing in Cell Robotics, 
a 
genetic engineering company which soon is expected to 
commercialize technology to extract single cells and manipulate 
them using genetic engineering. 
  Since the alliance with BDM was on a three-year contract, 
Global Tech is moving its headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, a 
suburb of Washington, D.C., to plan alliances with national 
research institutes, start-up companies, and large corporations 
clustered in that area. 
  According to Hiroshi Takeuchi, vice president of Global 
Tech, 
one promising area is environmental technology to address 
problems such as systems to comply with freon regulations, 
cooling systems for industrial machinery, and management of 
toxic wastes and discarded tires. It's attractive because the 
Clinton administration is calling for industry advances in this 
area. 
  More than 100 Japanese companies have set up offices in the 
Washington, D.C., area to collect information and lobby. 
Mitsui's mission of Japan-U.S. business alliances makes it 
unusual.

  [Text] The Gumma Regional Technology Exchange Forum 
(Toshihisa Nezu, chairman; Faculty of Engineering, Gumma 
University, Kiryu City, Gumma Prefecture; Tel. 0277-22-3181) 
supports the technology of Gumma industries with the 
participation of Gumma U, Gumma Technical College, Gumma 
Prefecture Industrial Research Institute, and Gumma Prefecture 
Managers' Association. This year it has reorganized its 
Automation Promotion Sub-panel into the New Technology 
Development Research Sub-panel. The sub-panel, which is just 
getting started, will support product development and original 
technology development of companies in Gumma. The sub-panel 
recently began its activity with a sub-panel meeting. 
  Gumma Prefecture has aggressively attracted companies to the 
prefecture, so it has seen the value of industrial shipments 
rise. Many local companies are sub-contractors to those 
companies, so it is desirable to support the growth of local 
companies which can develop their own products and original 
technology. The New Technology Development Research Sub-panel 
will address that topic through a forum made up of 
representatives from industry, academia, and government. 
  The sub-panel will focus on companies that develop their own 
products and technology without relying on technology 
introductions and which hold a distinctive position in the 
domestic market. It will conduct its research by lecturing on 
actual case studies, factory tours, and so on. The sub-panel is 
expected to meet twice a year with the meeting held by the 
target companies. The first meeting was held on 5 October at 
Katsura Machinery (Yoji Sekiguchi, president; Maebashi City, 
Tel. 0272-21-1461), Japan's leading block machine manufacturer. 
It included a lecture by president Sekiguchi and a tour of the 
company's factory. The second meeting is planned for February 
1994.

<H3>    Corporate Sitings in Technopolises Have Fallen Rapidly Due 
to Recession. </H3>
  Though technopolises were meant to be like America's Silicon 
Valley, they're degenerating into industrial parks. Problems 
such as inadequate control by MITI and the use of technopolises 
as ``good causes'' by regions and by politicians snaring public 
works projects are behind the retreat from the original concept. 
  The concept of the technopolis, which started under the 
jurisdiction of MITI in 1983, was to aim for innovation based on 
the fostering of start-ups and industry-academia cooperation 
rooted in the region. 
  However, today, ten years later, the reality of the 
technopolis is very different from the original concept. 
<H3>  Local Governments Put Local Revitalization First, 
Regionalism and Nurturing of New Industries Second </H3>
  The biggest problem is that often the technopolises have 
almost become industrial parks not very similar to the research 
parks of Silicon Valley on which they were modeled. As local 
governments put local revitalization first, they persist in 
pursuing factories from Tokyo and Osaka companies, putting in 
second place the nurturing of regional distinctiveness and new 
industries. The corporations are under the influence of their 
headquarters, which is fine when times are good. However, when 
the economy plunges, people are quickly recalled and plans are 
quickly cut. This makes it difficulty for long-term research to 
survive. 
  Take Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, one of the 26 
designated technopolis regions. Its geographic conditions are 
favorable and it is blessed with local industries such as 
musical instruments and motorcycles. Even here the business plan 
is behind schedule. 
  Toda Industrial Park is at the core of the city's 
technopolis 
plan. The parceling out of the 100-hectare industrial park began 
in March 1990. As the bubble economy still lingered then, 
companies were very interested in entering the park. Before two 
years were up, the park was 100% parceled out to 68 
companies. 
  However, of the 68 companies, nine have yet to begin 
building 
one to two years after obtaining the land. That is because 
companies had to reconsider totally their investments in plant 
and equipment when the economy declined immediately after the 
companies signed their contracts. 
  The sales contract the companies signed with Hamamatsu 
includes an obligation to be in operation within three years of 
obtaining the land. Companies which do not fulfill that 
condition must pay a penalty or return the land to the city. If 
this rule is strictly applied, companies will suffer and 
Hamamatsu will lose companies it wooed. As a last resort, the 
standard of ``operation within three years'' was changed to 
``construction begun within three years.'' 
  However, since prospects are poor for economic recovery in 
the latter half (October 1993 to March 1994) of this fiscal 
year, meeting even the revised standard will be a tall order for 
the companies. The three companies with an October 1993 deadline 
have not submitted their applications for architectural approval 
and cannot start construction in time. The remaining six 
companies with deadlines in April 1994 or January 1995 are 
conferring with Hamamatsu on how to meet the construction start 
deadline even with scaled down plans for first stage 
construction. 
<H3>  Retreat of Companies has Begun to Stand Out, a Region That 
Hasn't Attracted Even One Company </H3>
  Cases of companies giving up on technopolises have begun 
appearing as the business climate has worsened. Automotive parts 
manufacturer Shin Kobe Plastic had planned to build a factory at 
Hiroshima's Chuo Technopolis, but in July 1992 it completely 
retreated from the plan and returned the land to Hiroshima 
Prefecture. ``Based on the direction of the automotive market, 
we must give up on constructing a new plant,'' explained the 
company to the prefecture. 
  The prefecture, which had attracted the company, was 
devastated by the cancellation of construction plans. But the 
Hiroshima company Mazda, which uses Shin Kobe's products, 
suffered a rapid downturn due to the declining demand for 
automobiles. There is nothing to be done to relieve the sorry 
plight of companies which rely on Mazda. 
  The problem is not only with Shin Kobe. Last year two other 
companies gave up on technopolis plans. Automotive seat belt 
manufacturer Takata had acquired land in the prefecturally 
operated Taguchi Industrial Park and Daiure, a processor of 
urethane for automotive seats, had planned to build a plant in 
the prefecturally operated Chiyoda Industrial Park. Both 
companies returned the land to the prefecture. Both were hurt by 
the recession in the automotive industry. 
  Hiroshima Prefecture has many automotive parts manufacturers 
and subcontractors to large-scale heavy industries such as 
ship-building and steel. One purpose of getting the technopolis 
designation from MITI was to lessen the prefecture's reliance on 
existing industries -- such as automobiles, ship-building, and 
steel -- by encouraging location of high-tech industries such as 
electronics and machinery in the technopolis. There were some 
positive results. The national brewing laboratory and 
Matsushita's research laboratory were lured to the technopolis. 
But mostly companies in the automotive industry wanted to enter 
the technopolis during the bubble era. As a result, there was 
insufficient industrial diversification. That's one reason the 
current recession has hurt very badly. 
  Hiroshima and Hamamatsu are in the top three of the 26 
technopolises in terms of value of manufactured goods shipped. 
They were blessed from the outset with a concentration of 
industries such as autos and instruments, moreover they have big 
cities nearby. It is noteworthy that companies are giving up 
even in these two regions. There are many regions with worse 
conditions that cannot even attract industry. 
  ``In 1984, on the occasion of the moving of Akita Airport, 
three industrial parks were created,'' according to Akita 
Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. ``The good economy 
continued and companies were locating as expected. Last year was 
the worst. Not one company was attracted to the technopolis. The 
severe conditions are continuing this year.'' 
  ``We are working hard to attract companies with inspection 
tours and explanatory meetings, but we get a very bad feeling 
from the corporate side. Last year we attracted eight companies, 
but this year we're stuck at one,'' according to Yamaguchi 
Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. The majority of 
technopolises are having varying degrees of difficulty in 
attracting companies due to the sluggish economy. 
<H3>  Introductory Pamphlets are Virtually Indistinguishable: 
``Electronics, Biotech, New Materials ...'' </H3>
  A diagram (see below) of the changes in number of corporate 
locations in the technopolis areas which make up more than ten 
percent of Japan's newly established factory locations, shows 
that in 1990, driven by the bubble economy, there was a record 
of 474 new sitings in those 20 earlier regions designated from 
1984 to 1986. This is more than twice the number in 1981. 
  However, since 1991 the downturn in the economy has been 
accompanied by reconsideration of plans for excessive investment 
in plant and equipment. The number of new locations has dropped 
35% in the two years since 1991, falling to 307 cases in 
1992. 
Corporate appetites for investment in plants and equipment are 
expected to decline further this year. 
  ``If industrial parks are filled up, that's a kind of 
business success. But the technopolises were based originally on 
the ideal of Silicon Valley. Despite that, they've become 
something very different from nurturers of new industries. There 
is a need to reconsider how technopolises differ from industrial 
parks.'' This is at the heart of the problem, according to Ichio 
Hiramoto, assistant division chief of the social welfare 
division of Mitsubishi Research Institute. As an urban 
development specialist, Hiramoto has experience with drafting 
plans for large scale development projects such as the 
technopolises. 
  The content of introductory pamphlets for the various 
technopolises are virtually indistinguishable, particularly in 
the fields that they want to develop. They have sweeping goals 
in electronics, software, biotechnology, new materials and so 
on. It's almost as if their goals were cut by cookie cutter. 
There are very few prefectures with the individuality to say 
``if we don't go into that area, we'll lag behind in research in 
that field.'' 
<H3>  Yamagata Prefecture Achieves Success With Research Focus, 
``Make a Distinctive Plan that Doesn't Follow the System'' </H3>
  Of course, there are also individualistic approaches. 
Yamagata Prefecture decisively narrowed the target for its 
research and development, thus overcoming its geographical 
handicap. 
  Life support technologies, such as the development of an 
artificial heart and prevention of aging, are the pride of 
Yamagata. Yamagata ``aims to be second to none in Japan'' in 
research related to living bioradicals such as active oxygen 
which is said to be closely related to damage to living 
organisms from causes such as cancer and aging, according to 
Yamagata Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. 
  In November 1988 a life support technology research and 
development organization was set up as a voluntary organization. 
It has become a cooperative development project involving 70 
companies and 120 university researchers. A Bioradical 
Laboratory was built as the core facility with &yen;4.5 billion 
raised by the prefecture. The laboratory drew Fumio Inaba, 
professor emeritus of Tohoku Institute of Technology from 
neighboring Miyagi Prefecture and began a public-private jointly 
funded Bio Light Information Laboratory. 
  It was possible to attract personnel due to good narrowing 
of 
the research goal and legwork. Yamagata succeeded in creating a 
somewhat different kind of attractiveness with its living body 
radical research. 
  ``A prefecture like ours (with poor geographic conditions) 
couldn't survive if we did the same thing as everyone else. It 
is important to create a distinctive plan for a local area 
rather than to be lead by the national system,'' says the 
Industrial Promotion Section persuasively. 
  There are examples of other local governments where several 
tens of pre-existing researchers have been collected in a 
foundation or in the tertiary sector to create unique 
cooperative research between corporations and local universities. 
  There are many cases in which practical research results 
have 
been achieved. For example: Kumamoto Prefecture's apparatus 
using optical sensors for non-destructive continuous sweetness 
testing of mandarin oranges and the Shin Niigata-Nagaoka 
technopolis' sub-micron super accurate CNC lathe. 
  However, unfortunately the technopolises cannot be compared 
to America's Silicon Valley, which gave birth to many companies 
like Intel that will bring forth a new generation and which has 
become a world-wide mecca for the computer industry. 
<H3>  Designated Regions With Inflated Egos, Development From 
Perspective of a Single Unit of a Bloc is Indispensable </H3>
  Why have 26 locations spawned such similar plans? 
  In 1984, the year after the establishment of the Technopolis 
Law, MITI began approving development plans based on prefectural 
applications. This is what MITI officials familiar with the 
circumstances back then say. 
  At the project stage the technopolis was distorted into 
something completely different from the original concept. MITI 
meant to select two to three sites from across the country in a 
strict selection process and create very pure research parks 
which would serve as national models. However, at the 
application stage there were many prefectures which said that if 
other prefectures did it, then they wanted to do it. Then the 
local Diet members got involved. As a result, 26 locations were 
designated representing more than half of the prefectures. For 
the Diet members the technopolises were a way of extending the 
public works budget for highways and maintenance. Most local 
governments used the technopolises for ``good causes'' and ended 
up with plans very different from the original intention. 
Regional egos and the machinations of politicians have warped 
the concept of the technopolis. 
  MITI itself does not control the budget for developing the 
technopolises. The localities have been chartered by MITI to be 
in charge of the benefits of public works. Another problem is 
inadequate control by MITI which designated 26 regions even 
though that contradicted its purposes. 
  This is not just a problem with the technopolises. It's also 
a problem since then with MITI's Key Facilities Siting Law and 
its Regional Core Cities Law. Twenty-three locations have been 
designated under the Key Facilities Siting Law and 44 (almost 
all of the prefectures) for the Regional Core Cities Law. ``Most 
of Japan's model development undertakings are influenced by 
various dynamics during the implementation stage and tend to get 
uniformly watered down across the country,'' says Mitsubishi 
Research Institute assistant division chief Hiramoto. The 
technopolises reproduce the problems of Japan's administrative 
organization on a smaller scale. 
  The fact of 26 designated regions cannot be changed. ``The 
topic for debate is how to deal with role allocation and mutual 
cooperation among the 26 regions. It's necessary to think about 
how to use limited manpower and funds efficiently. For this 
purpose it's necessary to overcome the existing prefectural 
framework to think of development from a perspective as one unit 
of a bloc,'' says Yoshikazu Iwasaki, chief researcher of the 
research division of Japan Industrial Location Center which 
deals with research and drafting of development plans. 
  For example, the seven prefectures of Kyushu and Tohoku's 
six 
prefectures have each received a technopolis designation. It's 
natural that they'll compete in attracting companies to the 
region. 
  In Kyushu at the end of the first phase of the technopolis 
plan in 1990, Kumamoto, which had quickly succeeded in 
establishing an image as the mecca for the semiconductor and 
related[?rinkuu?] industries, achieved 98.9% of its goal 
for 
industrial shipments whereas on the opposite shore Nagasaki 
contented itself with 69.9%. 
  Nagasaki Prefecture has little flat land and limited 
resources, so it would be difficult to locate there industries 
such as semiconductors which require large quantities of water. 
Prefectural per capita income languishes at forty-fourth among 
the prefectures. A major cause of problems has been the reliance 
of the local economy on shipbuilding. ``In reality Nagasaki is 
equipped with highways and an airport, so in terms of access it 
compares favorably, but it has a poor image compared to Kumamoto 
and Fukuoka,'' according to Nagasaki Prefecture's Industrial 
Promotion Section. 
  Nagasaki Prefecture appears poised to begin capitalizing on 
its shipbuilding skills by fostering local companies in the area 
of machine processing and on its long coastline by developing 
marine environmental protection technology and ocean bottom 
exploration technology. 
  However, this approach won't work unless it collaborates 
with 
the neighboring prefectures. If Kyushu's prefectures can 
cooperate to attract industries suited to their technical 
specialties and geographic characteristics, then development 
will occur in a balanced way across Kyushu and companies will 
see the advantages of locating in Kyushu. 
<H3>  Corporations Also Need to Change Their Thinking and Move 
Toward Research Exchange Unhampered by Company-First-Ism </H3>
  In the beginning there was no industry clustered in the 
U.S.' 
Silicon Valley. Stanford University, a second-tier university, 
played a role when an industrial park was built near the 
university. That was the beginning of Silicon Valley. Now about 
2,000 companies have their headquarters in Silicon Valley which 
has become a research park whose researchers spin off start-ups 
and nurture them into full-blown companies. 
  ``The biggest difference from Japan is the existence of 
``software programs'' for nurturing promising companies. 
Innovation won't come from splendid buildings built from a 
public works mentality,'' according to Mitsubishi Research 
Institute's Hiramoto. 
  In Silicon Valley, university researchers may turn into 
entrepreneurs the next day and personnel move frequently between 
companies. Rather than start off with a building and an 
organization, they pull together the people and organization 
most suited to fostering development. This is how Silicon Valley 
supports creativity. 
  In Japan, by comparison, even when companies cluster 
together 
they're separated by company-first-ism. There's little exchange 
of research and little technological impact on local companies. 
``There are forums set up by local governments or foundations, 
but they are generally little more than social gatherings. 
Research exchange across corporate boundaries won't happen just 
because people dance the bon odori together,'' said the head of 
a laboratory located in a technopolis. 
  To turn the technopolises into something substantial, it 
isn't enough to simply address administrative problems. Change 
must be made to corporate research customs and to the 
characteristics that make Japanese poor at exchanges.

  [Text] On 1 October a press conference was held at the 
Science and Technology Agency by Akihito Arima and Minoru Oda, 
respectively the incoming and outgoing directors general of the 
Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) which 
represents Japan. Arima said he would continue Oda's policy of 
internationalization and outside evaluation. ``I'd like to 
create a Riken open wide to universities,'' said Arima. 
  Arima rated highly the internationalism of RIKEN which 
includes 200 foreign researchers. ``While pursuing 
internationalization, I'd also like to put energy into 
continuing the tradition of Drs. Shin'ichiro Asanaga and Hantaro 
Nagaoka through exchange with universities.'' 
  After Arima left the presidency of the University of Tokyo 
in 
March 1993, he returned to teaching as a professor at Hosei 
University. Even after becoming RIKEN's director general, during 
the school year he'll return to campus on Mondays to teach. 
  A report instigated by outgoing director Oda on the outside 
evaluation of RIKEN by Nobel prize winners and others was 
recently completed. It will be ``homework'' for Arima. ``I've 
been fortunate enough to have Professor Oda make a plan for 
improving the University of Tokyo's science faculty. I will take 
Professor Oda's `homework' very seriously,'' promised Arima.

  [Text] The value of Aichi Prefecture's industrial shipments 
accounts for 11.4% of the nation's total. It has been in 
first 
place in Japan since 1977. 
  Aichi has a broad range of industries. It has local 
industries such as textiles, ceramics, and food processing. It 
is in a broad range of fields involving mechatronics, including 
automobiles, machine tools, electrical equipment, and precision 
machinery. It is also achieving noteworthy developments in new 
technology fields such as fine ceramics and aerospace. 
  Aichi's excellent record in ``making things'' has been 
attributed to: a wealth of natural resources such as land, 
water, and ports; its position in the middle of the Tokaido 
megalopolis stretching from Tokyo to Osaka; its superb 
transportation infrastructure of railroads and highways; and its 
reliable management resources and local networks which have been 
fostered since the time of the Owari daimyo. 
  Facing the twenty-first century the Tokai region centering 
around Aichi hopes to become even more of an industrial capitol 
focused on manufacturing as a key region in manufacturing 
technology which is open to the world. 
  Aichi is culturally active. In October 1992 Aichi opened the 
Aichi Arts and Culture Center where opera can be fully staged. 
Aichi also has long fostered the traditional theatrical arts. 
<H3>  Preparations for a Headquarters of R&amp;D and Exchange: 
Science and Technology Exchange Center Plans and Toyohashi 
Science Core </H3>
  Aichi is planning an important development and research area 
called the Aichi Science R&amp;D Center which will center in the 
20 
kilometer hilly region to the west and east of Nagoya. It is 
trying to build a national center for research exchange which 
will rival Tsukuba and the Kansai region by attracting leading 
technology companies, laboratories, and universities for 
research centered in this geographic zone. As part of its plan, 
Aichi is planning a Science and Technology Exchange Center 
(tentative name) as a center for researchers' exchange. This 
will be the pioneering project of its central zone area, a 
candidate for a 21st Century world's fair (see below). 
Currently, Aichi aims to set up by 1994 the foundation that will 
be the main organization. It is making final adjustments as it 
develops a consensus among the region's industry, academia, and 
national research institutes. It is already, as expected, 
expanding research exchange by establishing and running exchange 
groups organized on a membership basis and by holding forums. 
According to the plan, once the facilities are completed the 
work of education, information dissemination, and promotion of 
cooperative research will begin in earnest using the Center as 
headquarters. This will be part of a process of establishing a 
world-class industrial technology R&amp;D region which will be a 
center for disseminating scientific and technical around the 
world. 
  Moreover plans are being carried forward for Science Create 
21 which would establish a industry-academia-government R&amp;D 
base 
centered on Toyohashi Technical University of Technology in 
Toyohashi, the main city in the Toyokawa region. Toyohashi 
Science Core was completed in November 1992 as Science Create 
21's key facility under Civil Law (minkotsu) Number 1. It will 
be operated by the third sector Science Create 21 K.K. which was 
established to promote the improvement and activity of the 
Toyokawa region's industry. It is developing projects in areas 
such as joint R&amp;D, personnel training, industry-academia 
exchanges, and support for nurturing new companies. It will 
thereby support the region's R&amp;D and technology development 
activities. 
<H3>  Strengthening the Development of Frontier Technology and 
Design: Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion Center and 
International Design Center </H3>
  Aichi is aggressively addressing the issue of promoting next 
generation frontier technologies at the same times as it builds 
an R&amp;D base. The 1988 Aichi Prefecture Industrial Technology 
Promotion Plan named frontier technologies which the region 
should target: mechatronics, new materials, aerospace, 
artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. In addition to 
promoting the location in Aichi of national-level research 
laboratories in these technology areas, Aichi is promoting 
international technology exchange by attracting various 
international conferences. Since the small but concentrated 
aerospace industry involves advanced technology with 
applications to many industries, in 1989 the Chubu Aerospace 
Industry Technology Promotion Research Center was established 
through industry-academia cooperation. In September 1993 it was 
expanded into the Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion 
Center for the purpose of expanding its work and strengthening 
its structure. The Center will promote the region's policy 
initiatives, research exchange, and diffusion of technology to 
other industries. The Tokai region already accounts for about 
50% of the nation's aerospace assembly work, but it's 
planning 
to increase that concentration by attracting related large-scale 
testing and evaluation facilities such as high Reynolds number 
wind tunnels. 
  The prefecture is also putting its energy into improving 
design development ability, another part of strengthening 
research capabilities. Design is playing a more and more 
important role in linking industry and life and in linking high 
technology and emotions. The prefecture is building an 
International Design Center to strengthen design capabilities 
and to establish a base for the world-wide transmission of 
design information. For that purpose a third sector corporation 
was set up with the cooperation of the prefecture, Nagoya city, 
and business. The building is planned to open in 1996. 
<H3>  Strengthening Regional Information Transmission: 
Transportation Infrastructure Preparation and Holding a World's 
Fair in 2005 </H3>
  Aichi and the rest of the Tokai region are strongly 
promoting 
the expansion of the region's transportation infrastructure for 
the 21st century, including roads and the Tokai-Hokuriku line, 
through three big public-private projects: Chubu New 
International Airport, Number 2 Tokyo-Nagoya/Nagoya-Kobe 
Highway, and the Chuo Shinkansen train line. 
  Aichi's prosperity as an industrial region has rested on its 
fortunate geographic location in the center of Japan, a 
strategic point in national transportation, including roads, 
railroads, and ports. However, it is important that Aichi 
improve its transportation system so that it increases its role 
as an information base open to Japan and to the world. Only then 
can Aichi change towards a more balanced industrial structure 
less skewed toward processing and assembly. Only then can it 
hope to step up to become a key region for industrial technology 
open to the world, the kind of region advocated by the Fourth 
National Comprehension Plan? of the 21st century. 
  Aichi is planning to complete this infrastructure by 2005 
because it will hold the 21st century's first world's fair. 
Aichi is trying to attract [participants] from all over the 
world and is engaging in various kinds of preparation -- with 
the support of the relevant ministries such as MITI and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- for the 21st Century World's Fair 
(tentative name) which is planned to be the largest exhibition 
in Japan since the 1970 world's fair in Osaka. 
  The candidate region has selected the southeast portion of 
Seto City in the heart of the above-mentioned Aichi Science 
R&amp;D 
Zone. It has a theme rooted in the area's potential: Technical 
and cultural exchange--Creation of a new world. 
  The Committee for the Basic Concept of the 21st Century 
World's Fair (chairman: N. Kimura, professor emeritus, 
University of Tokyo) made up of learned persons from various 
fields is moving towards selecting a basic concept by June 1994. 
An interim report echoed the basic significance of a world's 
fair by proposing ``a `New world's fair as a grove for exchange 
among global citizens' in which the world's people think, 
discuss, propose and identify solutions, and disseminate their 
information to the world.'' The committee is groping for a new 
approach to operation, participation, and other aspects of 
holding the event. 
  After the basic concept has been accepted by Aichi and the 
nation has decided to go ahead with holding the fair, a formal 
application will be made to the Bureau of International 
Expositions (BIE) in 1996, nine years in advance. Aichi has done 
public relations work with foreign countries at the World's Fair 
in Sevile and the Genoa exhibition in 1992 and at the Taejon, 
Korea, exhibition in 1993. Hopes are high that if the BIE grants 
permission and the world's fair is held successfully, then the 
incredible information-spreading power of a world's fair will 
offer an opportunity for rapid progress in the region and, in 
turn, will foster information and develop the region's industry.

<H5>  Attitude of attack </H5>
  ``In the Kilby Patent, there is a 60/40 chance of winning, 
but the risk is too high. There is no risk for National 
Semiconductor. We must attack.'' (Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
Intellectual Property Liaison Dept.) 
  Having been sued for patent infringement of the patent for 
semiconductor production technology by National Semiconductor 
(NS) of the United States, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. took on NS 
at the end of August and brought a countersuit for patent 
infringement. Also, the Kilby Patent is the basic patent for 
semiconductors held by Texas Instruments (TI) of the United 
States. 
  For the past two years, negotiations with NS concerning 
cross-licensing of the patent concerning semiconductors 
continued, but an agreement on price and conditions was not 
reached and since they were caught on a snag, it was decided to 
request a public judgement in court. 
  In the background there is a calculation that ``litigation 
is 
certainly costly, but even so the cost is about one tenth the 
settlement money.'' Mitsubishi decided to set out the stance of 
this attack in their patent strategy three or four years before. 
  Entering Mitsubishi Electric via being the Director-General 
of the Patent Office, vice-president Kazuo Wakasugi assumed the 
position of Intellectual Property Department chief in June 1989. 
Immediately upon taking this position, he mentioned the idea of 
``making patents a source of income with the expansion of patent 
acquisition abroad, beginning with the United States, and 
broadening claims at the time of application'' and promoted the 
switch from defense to offense. This change in awareness is 
related to this countersuit. 
<H5>  From Quantity to Quality Emphasis </H5>
  ``Only 5% of the income from technical material is 
paid. For 
us to be the `Hitachi of technology,' it must be at least 
Germany's average 50%.'' 
  The director of the Hitachi, Ltd. Intellectual Property 
Rights Department, Katsunori Ogawa has never forgotten these 
words grumbled on a day 23 years ago by Toshihiko Kubo, 
vice-president at that time. 
  It was Hitachi which introduced the system for evaluating 
inventions in the second half of the 1960's and the full 
disclosure system in 1970, but until 1981, the increase in the 
number of patent applications remained a constant barometer for 
invention activities. Those results were fruitful and the wish 
of Kubo was for realization after ten years. Looking back, Ogawa 
says ``we did not think we could clear the objective in just ten 
years.'' 
  Along with the advance to foreign markets and the expansion 
of business zones, disputes among foreign and domestic 
businesses have gradually increased and the switch of emphasis 
from quantity to quality seemed to be approaching. 
  Around 1975, in an export project for heavy electronics 
products, Ogawa, assigned to the processing of banned requests 
received from foreign businesses, was surprised to find that in 
the expanding patents of his company, not one patent was 
effective on partners. This ordeal was instructive and he 
started the Strategic Patent Redoubling Movement in 1981; in 
1985, income and outgo from technical material rare in Japanese 
business was in the black. 
  In the past several years, patent disputes in US-Japanese 
business have been increasing and each company is strengthening 
critical awareness. With the main products being the subject, it 
is disliked that trials are lengthened just by taking ``actually 
a form to suppress the first shoot'' (Director Yasuo Nishiguchi 
of Kyocera) and many cases are also settled with a compromise. 
<H5>  Compromise is a Stopgap Measure </H5>
  Vice-president Wakasugi of Mitsubishi Electric appeals for a 
revision of awareness and says ``in the end there are the 
problems of the income and outgo and the percentage of 
victories, but it is necessary not to compromise at once and to 
claim the rights of this company definitely in a dry manner of 
the partner.'' 
  Even when compromise is chosen, the fact is that this is 
just 
a stopgap measure. This is because resistance is not possible 
with such a policy in cases of demands to halt business and to 
ban production and sales. 
  Hitachi is pressing patent activity called a ``fighting 
patent'' in which ``it is not simply applied for, but fosters 
individual patents with strong rights. The application claim of 
the patent is taken broadly.'' Also, the way of Mitsubishi which 
is taking action with a countersuit is one such model case.

<F P=106> [Article by Terumichi Murakami, Research Director, Nomura </F>
Research Institute] 
  [Text] The Nomura Research Institute surveyed 1800 Japanese 
businesses concerning the current situation of intellectual 
property rights. From the results of the survey, the 
characteristics of the electronics industry were inferred with 
the comparison of the industries of pharmaceuticals, 
automobiles, and machines. In the electronics industry, even 
when disputes arise, they rarely advance to litigation. 
Litigation is more often brought by foreign businesses than 
domestic businesses. Organizations for handling intellectual 
property rights are prepared, but are as yet passive concerning 
the assertion of rights. Less than 70% of businesses are 
equipped with a defense mechanism in the way of using patents. 
  A questionnaire survey was sent to the persons responsible 
for intellectual property rights of 1800 Japanese businesses of 
all types excluding financial organizations (``Survey of 
Intellectual Property Rights'', November 1992, 480 usable 
replies, 26.6% response rate).[.sup]1[/] Based on the 
results of this questionnaire, an overview of the measures and 
the current state of the intellectual property rights measures 
was made from the viewpoint of comparison with other industries. 
  The examination was made mainly with patents in mind. 
  Of all responses to the questionnaire, 61 companies 
responded 
from the electronics industry (the electric instruments 
industry, in the questionnaire). Upon looking at close 
industries, 16 were precision instruments companies and 45 were 
machine companies; these three industries made up 25% of 
the 
total. Moreover, the industries of individual businesses was 
determined by the businesses themselves, the questionnaire being 
multiple choice. 
  The survey results were broadly divided into the current 
state of disputes concerning intellectual property rights and 
the companies' systems concerning intellectual property rights. 
The characteristics of the electronics industry for each of 
these respectively is explained. 
  The questionnaire asked about disputes concerning 
intellectual property rights during the five years up to 1992. 
The special characteristics of the domestic electronics industry 
for disputes can be learned from these results. 
  Compared with other industries, there are three 
characteristics in this industry. First, even if intellectual 
property rights disputes occur, they rarely are related to 
litigation (Figure 1 (a)). Second, most litigation caused as a 
violation of the partner's rights is brought by foreign 
companies and individuals (Figure 1 (b)). Third, in disputes 
with foreign partners, rights are asserted from another as the 
rights are violated more often than rights are asserted to 
another as one's rights are violated. 
<H5>  Litigation is Difficult to Bring Even When Disputes Arise </H5>
  Let's look at the survey results for the first point. The 
questionnaire asked about the experience in the five years up to 
1992 of the two cases of intellectual property rights disputes 
beginning by sending a warning of rights violations and those 
cases going as far as litigation. The statistics introduced here 
are the results for disputes of the said company violating 
another's rights and asserting rights. 
  Looking at Japanese business overall, businesses having 
experienced intellectual property rights disputes amount to 
56% 
of all (Table 1). In other words, one out of two companies has 
experienced a dispute. Disputes with the inventors of foreign 
companies and foreigners are 27.8% which is high, being 
close 
to 30%.

five years up to 1992. In each industry, the percentage of companies 
experiencing disputes and litigation of violating the rights of another are 
shown. From ``Survey of Intellectual Property Rights'' (Nomura Research

  Excluding the 20% or so service industries and the 
energy 
industry experiencing disputes, in any type of the manufacturing 
industries, over half of businesses have experienced an 
intellectual property rights dispute. In the electronics 
industry, most, 72.1%, of businesses have that 
experience. In 
the precision, automobile, and pharmaceuticals industries as 
well, those not having that experience are in the minority. 
  On the other hand, companies having experienced litigation 
even once in the past five years are 18.4% when seen from 
the 
industry as a whole. By the way, the average number of incidents 
was 1.7. In the electronics industry, the percentage of 
companies with litigation experience is 16.4% and is less 
than 
overall. 
  When finding the overall number of disputes and the 
percentage of incidents (litigation rate) which went as far as 
litigation, characteristics of the electronics industry are 
shown. For convenience, Table 1 A/C shows the litigation rate. 
In responding businesses overall, the litigation rate was 
32.8%. In the electronics industry, the litigation rate 
was 
very low, 22.7% (p.311 Figure 1 (a)). 
  Even in the electronics industry, when looking at disputes 
of 
foreign parties, the litigation rate (Table 1 B/D) becomes 
32.1% and is almost the same level for industry overall 
which 
is 31.3%. In other words, in this industry, while the 
experience of disputes is way above the overall average, 
domestic disputes are often resolved before going as far as 
litigation. 
<H5>  Litigation Part is 90% Foreign </H5>
  Also related to the above results, the electronics industry 
has an extremely high percentage of litigation with foreign 
parties in experience of litigation (Table 1 B/A, p. 311 Figure 
1 (b)). Looking at Japanese industry overall, the percentage of 
litigation with foreign parties was 47%. In the case of 
the 
electronics industry, it actually reached 90%. 
  In effect, in this industry, litigation concerning 
intellectual property rights problems is in itself litigation 
with foreign parties; it is very rarely litigation between 
Japanese businesses and individual inventors. The electronics 
industry is an industry having a special pattern of intellectual 
property rights disputes with a combination of the high 
``dispute processing efficiency'' within Japan and the high 
frequency of litigation with foreigners. 
  There are more of the incidents themselves of litigation 
with 
foreign parties than in other industries. The percentage of 
businesses having the experience of litigation brought by 
foreign businesses in the past five years as those rights were 
violated was 8.7% (Table 1) for industry overall. The 
percentage for the electronics industry was 14.8% and one 
of 
seven companies went as far as litigation with a foreign party. 
  Along with precision instruments and automobiles, the 
electronics industry is thought to be an industry with much 
experience of foreign litigation. These figures agree with the 
solid sense of the industry. By the way, the percentage for the 
precision machine industry was 31.3% and 20.0% for 
the 
automobile industry. 
<H5>  Rights Violations are Asserted in Many Cases </H5>
  The statistics up to now concern the disputes (violations 
cases) of rights asserted as the company concerned violated the 
rights of another company. Another side of the intellectual 
property rights dispute is the side of a non-violation with the 
company concerned actively asserting the rights. Another 
characteristic of the electronics industry concerning disputes 
with foreign parties is seen by looking at the percentage of 
violations and non-violations. 
  In the electronics industry, the percentage of violation 
cases with warnings from another company greatly surpasses the 
cases of non-violation where one company asserts their rights to 
another. Figure 2 shows the position of the industry with the 
vertical axis being the percentage of businesses experiencing 
disputes with non-violation cases and the horizontal axis being 
the percentage of businesses experiencing violation cases. The 
electronics industry has a trend to the right of the average of 
domestic industry overall. 
  The Japanese electronics industry continually maintains a 
high competitive force in the global market and leads the world 
in new products as well. This figure shows that in the area of 
intellectual property rights, even now they are in a defensive 
position. 
<H3>  50% of Businesses See a Worsening of U.S.-Japan 
Disputes </H3>
  In disputes in the case of violations, in most industries, 
the United States nationality is seen most often (excluding 
Japan) when seen in detail by nationality of the party. In the 
electronics industry, among businesses experiencing disputes of 
violations cases 65.3% are with parties from the United 
States 
and 10.2% are with European parties. By the way, in cases 
of 
non-violations, 23.3% were United States, 6.7% 
were European, 
and 23.3% were Asian (multiple responses possible). 
  The unyielding attitude of United States businesses 
concerning intellectual property rights disputes, especially 
patent disputes, has a great influence on the intellectual 
property rights measures of Japanese businesses. One important 
issue of intellectual property rights concerning business 
management overall is the large scale patent disputes with 
American parties of Minolta Camera and Sega Enterprises (see pp. 
314-315 Steeply rising U.S. patent dispute reparations). 
  For this type of current situation, what type of perception 
do domestic businesses have concerning the movement of future 
U.S.-Japan patent disputes? This question was asked in the 
questionnaire. 
  In Japanese businesses overall, 50% of businesses 
have the 
pessimistic viewpoint that ``litigation from the United States 
will become more frequent and Japanese companies will undergo a 
great shock'' (Table 2). 23.6% of businesses 
optimistically 
grasp that ``disputes are temporary and are not to be worried 
about in the long run.'' 19.1% of businesses have the 
spirited 
viewpoint that ``in the near future Japanese businesses will 
become dominant in intellectual property rights disputes and the 
situation will become the opposite of now.'' The electronics 
industry also generally recognizes a similar pattern.

rights disputes. The percentages of businesses selecting each answer for 
the question of ``How will U.S.-Japanese intellectual property rights 
disputes be by the year 2000?'' are shown. From ``Survey of Intellectual

  On the other hand, some industries have a more spirited 
viewpoint. In the chemical and medical products industries, the 
viewpoint of not worrying in the long run is stronger than the 
viewpoint that Japanese businesses receive more blows. 
Furthermore, in the pulp and paper and ceramics industries, 
about 30% of businesses feel that Japanese business is 
becoming 
dominant. 
  Compared to the electronics and precision instruments 
industries, these are areas with a high degree of maturation as 
industries. For this reason they appear to be optimistic 
concerning the relationship of U.S.-Japanese intellectual 
property rights disputes. 
  What type of system do electronics makers have to deal with 
the above types of disputes concerning intellectual property 
rights? 
  From the results of the survey, in the electronics industry, 
the acquisition of intellectual property rights and the 
preparation of an organization to handle disputes are 
comparatively advanced and many personnel participate. 
Concerning the assertion of rights, naturally many businesses 
have a passive way of thinking. 
<H5>  Twenty Percent Have an Intellectual Property Rights Division </H5>
  Divisions handling intellectual property rights in domestic 
businesses historically were either organized as divisions 
related to general affairs or divisions related to research and 
development. Patents, the center of intellectual property 
rights, hold together the technical side of results of research 
and development and the side of rights for legally protecting 
those. 
  Affairs concerned with intellectual property rights in 
domestic businesses centered on patent applications up to now. 
Upon considering this point, businesses handling intellectual 
property rights in the R&amp;D division close to the scene of 
development had full scale handling. Also, recently, the 
necessity for litigation countermeasures in addition to patent 
application formalities has increased. Therefore, ``Intellectual 
Property Rights Divisions'' for unified control of intellectual 
property rights resistant to litigation and including business 
and legal divisions have appeared. 
  Upon considering this background, how much effort businesses 
put into intellectual property rights problems can be generally 
inferred by the department responsible. The efforts are 
considered to be getting serious if the responsible department 
is one of the following in order: the business division, legal 
affairs division, R&amp;D division, patent division, and 
intellectual property rights division. While some industries 
already have a system in the form of patent departments as in 
the medical and pharmaceutical products industry, industries 
also exist which do not even have the form of an intellectual 
property rights division. 
  When seen from this perspective, along with the precision 
instruments industry, the electronics industry in which 
comparatively many businesses have intellectual property rights 
divisions can be considered the industry with the most advanced 
full-scale handling (Figure 3). 
<H5>  Many Personnel Participate </H5>
  The same type of thing can be seen from the total number of 
personnel dealing with intellectual property rights. The total 
number of personnel is of course greater the larger the scale of 
the company, but varies rather widely depending on the type of 
business. In major businesses of over 10,000 employees in the 
electronics industry, the number of employees per one business 
has become overwhelming (Table 3). 



  Table 3. Number of personnel participating in intellectual property rights. 
This shows the average number for each size of corporation of the total number 
of personnel participating in intellectual property rights. The size of scale 
is classified by the number of employees. Small and medium companies have less 
than 1000 employees; large companies have 1000 to 10,000 employees; and major 
companies have over 10,000 employees. The electronics manufacturers classified 
as major companies separate overwhelmingly many people by the intellectual 
property rights policies. From ``Survey of Intellectual Property Rights''

  The closely related precision instruments industry as well 
is 
becoming an industry in which the average total number of 
employees is overwhelmingly great among businesses entering the 
category of large companies. 
  While some places have over 100 patent attorneys in one 
company in US businesses, in the case of Japanese businesses 
only 3.8% of all employees are personnel having the 
qualifications of attorneys and patent attorneys. The reason for 
this is that in Japan the burden on persons taking the 
qualifying exam for patent attorney is great and the contents 
also concern the application process and only contribute 
partially to the affairs concerning intellectual property 
rights. The current state in which business does not perform 
special treatment is another factor. 
  Actually, persons having the abilities of qualified persons 
even without qualifications appear to be lurking in Japanese 
companies. The same type of thing may also appear in the 
electronics industry. 
<H5>  The Easily Imitated Electronics Industry </H5>
  Relatively speaking, the electronics industry is the 
industry 
with the most advanced handling in the country in terms of 
personnel and organization. This does not mean that the 
awareness of ``rights'' for intellectual property rights as they 
are is the most advanced. 
  This questionnaire asked to what degree the rights held by 
one's company are asserted concerning products produced by other 
companies. In the current environment of intellectual property 
rights, it was asked whether the development of similar products 
by another company is possible (difficulty of imitation) and to 
what degree the rights of one's company are strongly asserted 
when imitated (assertion of rights). 
  Figure 4 shows these results seen by type of company. It is 
understood that in the electronics industry, the difficulty of 
imitation is low so it is comparatively easy for other companies 
to develop similar products and the assertion of rights is also 
low (Zone B of the figure). This agrees with the results of 
analyzing the current state of intellectual property rights 
disputes. 
  The pharmaceutical and medical products industry and the 
chemical industry are at the opposite pole; imitation is 
difficult and the assertion of rights appears high (Zone A of 
the figure). The automobile and steel industries fall into the 
category of industries where imitation is difficult, but the 
assertion of rights is not performed very actively (Zone C of 
the figure). 
  It is suggested that the electronics and automobile 
industries, presently dragging the Japanese economy, both fall 
into the category of low assertion of rights. If it may be fine 
to remain like this in the future, major questions remain. It is 
necessary to have energetic discussion in the industry. 
<H5>  Becoming Free From Defense Patents is Indicated </H5>
  The passive outlook of the electronics industry for 
intellectual property rights is also shown in the use of 
intellectual property rights. 
  When the way of using patents which are the nucleus of 
intellectual property rights is positioned in management 
strategies, it can be broadly divided into four types. The first 
is the defense method for attack by the intellectual property 
rights of a competing company. This is related to the action of 
applying for concentrated and many peripheral patents for 
applied technology related to the invention and items considered 
to be necessary in order to connect with the production of that 
invention. 
  The second is thinking to aim for a monopolistic position in 
the market, patenting very new and exclusive inventions of 
another company and not allowing another company to follow. This 
is said to make the most of the essential function of patents. 
  The third is to apply for and acquire patents actively and 
to 
restrain the entrance of another company to a specific area. 
This uses the application disclosure system of Japan's patent 
system as a dirty trick and uses the dark or clear influencing 
power in the R&amp;D strategies of competing companies due to 
active 
applications to a specific area. 
  The fourth is to publish the acquired patent (usually a 
selected publication) and attain royalties. 
  Figure 5 shows which of the four types is used by Japanese 
companies. Currently, companies viewing patents as a ``defense 
method'' are 60.7% of all. Companies ``aiming at a 
monopoly'' 
are 27.3%. Companies ``restraining other companies'' are 
8.4%. 
Companies ``acquiring royalties'' are 1.6% and close to 
none. 
Electronics manufacturers are more passive. In order they become 
67.9%, 25.0%, 5.4%, and 1.8%. 



  Figure 5. Freedom from defensive patents in the future. The ways of using 
patents are classified into four ways and the companies chose which they fell 
under. The percentages of companies choosing the respective choices of all 
companies responding are shown. The trend of the electronics industry is 
almost the same as this figure. In the electronics industry, currently 67.9% 
of companies chose ``method of defense,'' but in the future 41.4% replied 
``aiming at a monopoly.'' From ``Survey of Intellectual Property Rights'' 
(Nomura Research Institute, November 1992). Unit: %.

  However, in the future many businesses are thinking of 
improving this situation. When we asked about future 
development, companies choosing ``method of defense'' were 
28.7%, dropping by half. Meanwhile, companies selecting 
``aiming at a monopoly,'' ``restraining other companies,'' and 
``acquiring royalties'' increased. These expanded greatly to 
35.5%, 19.4%, and 14.9%. 
  The electronics industry is no exception. Looking at the 
contents of the responses, these were respectively 28.6%, 
41.1%, 17.9%, and 12.5%. If one considers 
using intellectual 
property rights as a ``method of defense'' as passive and the 
other three as active, it can be considered that the electronics 
industry in the future would like to develop an active 
intellectual property rights strategy. 
  Currently, the source of the competitive force of Japanese 
businesses has reached a point where it must shift from the 
capacity for quality control and price competition due to the 
so-called homogenous share expansion competition to the 
conceptual creative power for products and 
business.[.sup]2,3[/] The intellectual property rights 
strategy of each company is becoming the key to this shift. The 
electronics industry is the industry which must be the nucleus 
of this shift. In the future the electronics industry is 
expected to reconstruct the intellectual property rights 
strategy and develop into a creative industry at the same time 
being advanced and competitive.

Steeply Rising Indemnities for U.S. Patent Disputes 
  In patent disputes occurring in the United States, the 
amount 
of damage indemnification increases year by year. Figure A shows 
the indemnification for major litigation since the 1970's. For 
indemnification, since neither the United States and Japan have 
official statistics, this was made from information from 
newspapers, reports, and publications concerning patent law. 
This is not exhaustive data and only handles major litigation. 
  Looking at the changes in indemnification, the average 
amount 
was $13 million in 1975 to 1979, but was $18 million in 1980 to 
1984 and $33 million in 1985 to 1989, an increase of 13% 
each 
year. The average amount was $92 million in 1990 to 1992, an 
abrupt rise of 24% each year. 
  Looking at Figure A, cases concluded by adjudication 
increased since the second half of the 1970's. One reason for 
the rise in indemnification can be interpreted to be the 
increase in adjudication ordering payment of high 
indemnifications. Furthermore, at the second half of the 1980's, 
the payment of high indemnifications came to be seen even in 
cases concluded by compromise. This may show the trend of 
avoiding drawn out disputes. 
<H5>  Pro-Patent Policies are in the Background </H5>
  The patent policies of the United States government are 
behind the background of increasing indemnification. The switch 
to so-called ``pro-patent'' policies has caused the 
indemnifications in patent disputes to be pushed up. 
  Since the founding of the United States, patent law has been 
practiced. As seen in the inventions of Edison and Bell, 
invention activities were lively from the 19th century to the 
beginning of the 20th century. Afterwards, with the opportunity 
of the global panic in 1929, monopolies due to patents were 
limited and activity to prioritize anti-monopoly laws were 
performed. This was the so-called ``anti-patent'' policy. 
  The anti-patent policy continued up to the 1970's. At the 
second half of the 1970's, the basis for the anti-patent 
policies appears to have changed because of the drop into the 
red of trade income and the economic exhaustion due to the 
Vietnam conflict. In October 1979, under the administration of 
President Carter, the Carter Message (also called the Innovation 
Message) was delivered and the strengthening of patent rights 
once more was suggested. 
  In the first half of the 1980's, a drop in international 
competitive force especially in high technology areas and the 
rise of protectionism concerning trade problems were seen. With 
such a foundation, the policy trend is inclined towards 
``pro-patent'' policies to strength intellectual property rights 
centering on patents. 
  And the CAFC (Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) 
founded in 1982 takes part in the trend for strengthening patent 
rights protection. Since the foundation of CAFC, federal level 
has been stabilized and started on the basis for the pro-patent 
policy. As a result, many persons having rights have set about 
drastic litigation activity. 
<H5>  Awareness of Intellectual Property Rights is Low in Japan </H5>
  Despite the above conditions in the United States, to what 
degree are the damage indemnification of disputes occurring in 
Japan? In this questionnaire, the Japanese companies were asked 
about the indemnifications received in intellectual property 
rights disputes; the average damage indemnifications were 
&yen;134 million and a maximum of &yen;1.9 billion (Figure A). 
  These numbers are results including disputes with foreign 
parties, but most cases are considered to be the amounts 
received in disputes with domestic businesses. Compared with the 
indemnifications of patent disputes in the United States, these 
are at least one digit smaller. In just the numbers shown here, 
the US-Japanese indemnifications cannot be directly compared. 
There is no mistaking the great difference between them. This 
difference is thought to be because of the differences in 
setting a value on intellectual property in the United States 
and Japan. 
  The difference of awareness in the United States and Japan 
concerning the value of intellectual property is shown in the 
difference in the incidents of litigation concerning patents. 
For example, there were 1248 incidents of patent related 
litigation concluded in the 1989 fiscal year in the United 
States. A direct comparison cannot be made since the system is 
different, but in 1992, there were only 69 incidents of 
litigation related to industrial rights decided at the regional 
courts in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.

<F P=106> [Interview with RIKEN Director General Minoru Oda; </F>
interviewer and date not given: ...] 
  [Text] Universities and public research organizations have 
increasingly tried to have the details of research evaluated 
(reviewed) by external scientists. The University of Tokyo 
Science Department Physics Section and the Institute of Physical 
and Chemical Research (RIKEN) are applying this and the research 
institutes of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST) are introducing the same type of system. Efforts are made 
to avoid complacency and aim for the Center of Excellence (COE), 
but will this truly change Japan's research organizations? RIKEN 
Director General Minoru Oda was asked. 
<H5>  Boards of Directors Also the Subject </H5>
  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: RIKEN has had a system for evaluation 
of the results of research in the past. What was the goal of 
this? 
  ODA: Researchers in charge are reviewed every seven years 
and 
leaders of the frontier research system are also reviewed in the 
middle and at the end of the research period and are exposed to 
severe evaluation. So, what about in terms of organization 
management? In the board of directors about three and a half 
years ago, the subject of possibly reviewing the board of 
directors as well came up. 
  Immediately, my friend Professor Clark of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology came for about one week, but the areas 
of research in RIKEN are extensive. An advisory council of 
fifteen people from in the five areas of physics, chemistry, 
biology, engineering, and medicine was formed and was asked to 
make a periodic review every two years. 
  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Can appropriate evaluation be made in 
several days observation? 
  ODA: Two white papers showing in detail the management 
mechanisms, research headings, and budgets were made and sent in 
advance. Observation was for three days, but I think they saw 
well. We showed all the weak and strong spots of RIKEN. Some 
delegates said that research details were understood and became 
references. They are also rivals in this research, but if a 
sincere review is expected, we are resigned to show our 
capacities without reserve. It was decided to replace one third 
of the committee to avoid people saying what everyone else said. 
<H5>  Without Strict Evaluation </H5>
  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Though a special request was made of 
the personnel system, there were no strict indications. 
  ODA: With indiscriminate praise for research results, one 
feels inferior. The indication that public appeals for 
researchers in charge (lifelong work) have expanded globally is 
received seriously. Currently as well, we would like to open the 
gate, conduct conferences in the institute in English, tear down 
so-called walls, and invite superior human resources. Also, the 
proposal to raise the age limit to employment of a general 
researcher (less than 32 years of age as a rule) was a little 
unexpected. The conscious customary rule is the promotion of 
young people, but there may be ill effects if operated by hard 
and fast regulations. 
  In a certain sense, public reports may draw thorns, but for 
myself, straightforward opinions such as ``this research is not 
important'' in notes or orally also contribute. The proposal 
establishes committee meetings in the institute and would like 
to be related to improvements. 
<H5>  Difficulty in National Research Institutes </H5>
  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The chief executive officer has 
worked 
on the review of the University of Tokyo and U.S. national 
research institutes and also has experience on the ``evaluation 
side.'' Are the opinions of outsiders really viable? 
  ODA: Whether a research organization is lively and whether 
there are management problems are not understood from papers. 
External review is important for activation. Of course, if 
sufficient information is not disclosed, it is incomplete and 
meaningless because of neglect. It is not said that the 
accommodation of RIKEN was the maximum, but was made as clear as 
possible. The attitude of the evaluation makes or breaks the 
review. 
  RIKEN has a tradition of freely doing basic research and is 
favored. Before, I was at a university, but at the university I 
had autonomy and was afraid of external evaluation and contrary 
proposals. There were many problems difficult to resolve just by 
the efforts on the part of the university, such as the budget 
and system. Even so we thought to expand the review system. 
  NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The AIST National Institute for 
Advanced Interdisciplinary Research will soon introduce external 
evaluation. 
  ODA: This is basically good. But, generally the review of 
national institutes is thought to be more difficult than for 
universities. This is because even though the value of research 
is not superior in national institutes, the themes are those 
which must advance as national policy. The more facts are known, 
straightforward review becomes difficult. Isn't there danger of 
declaring it was done strictly and stopping? 
<H5>  Viewpoint: Necessity to Remove Walls in the System </H5>
  [Author Mikio Kamino] 
  The establishment of the advisory council is the so-called 
``parting gift'' of Director Oda who is retiring at the end of 
this month. How to make the most of the review has become the 
assignment. Because the University of Tokyo and RIKEN both honor 
students, they have taken the plunge into review. In the future, 
many other universities and public research organizations 
criticized of ``lukewarm constitution'' will require strict 
evaluation, but Mr. Oda also mentions that this is not so simple. 
  Universities and national research institutions introducing 
external review may increase more, but it is necessary to open 
the way to reforming systems such as personnel and budget since 
it may just be a pose of researchers showing ``humility.'' This 
will just burden with an assignment which cannot be solved and 
nothing will change.

<H5>  Going Backwards </H5>
  ``There are people who are taking research institutes 
backwards; we think this is a very awful thing.'' 
  President of Japan Infralogic, first in the world to develop 
fuzzy reasoning processors, Masayoshi Tokai looks back to the 
time spent working at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in the United States for 
almost four years from 1982. 
  With the thought that ``as said by those researchers, we go 
backwards when people break down. Therefore, going backwards is 
movement without energy and is no match for gravity'' (Tokai), 
this is practiced. 
  This is an amusing anecdote, but the problem is that 
researchers which are also said to be such apparently eccentric 
people naturally find receptive soil in the United States 
wherein such creative ideas are born. 
<H5>  Facing Income Balance </H5>
  In addition to the technical power and R&amp;D level of each 
country, looking at the technology trade balance which is 
becoming an important indicator, the quantity of Japan's 1992 
technology exports was &yen;386.5 billion and technology imports 
were &yen;910.1 billion (according to the Bank of Japan 
international income and outgo statistical monthly report) and 
were very much in the red. 
  The United States has overwhelmingly excessive exports with 
technology exports of &yen;2.562 trillion and technology imports 
of &yen;631.2 billion. 
  In 1970, the technology exports of the United States at that 
time were already &yen;834.7 billion and, looking just at the 
export funds, Japan's current level has not even surpassed the 
1970 level of the United States. 
  When seen by type of industry, the areas of Japanese 
construction and steel already have an excess of exports and the 
income and outgo ratio for electronics and transportation 
machinery is almost balanced. Even in the field of machinery 
with an excess of imports, the ``technology trade balance is 
still in the red. However in this, there is technology already 
exceeding cooperation. This does not end at the relationship of 
the contract.'' (Hideo Nishikawa, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Technology Department, Technology Control Director). Moreover, 
``Income and outgo are even and either becomes an excess of 
exports'' (Takemitsu Hoashi, Komatsu Business Research 
Department Director); accordingly, this is movement toward a 
fairly balanced state. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-23A>           Movement in Japan's Balance of Technology Trade </FIG>




  Tokai makes the analysis that ``technology has three 
aspects: 
ideas, making products (realization), and production. One alone 
is useless. At this point in time, the ideas are mostly from the 
United States, but Japan is already succeeding with the 
remaining two.'' 
  If the three required elements of technology are ideas, 
making products, and production, technical innovation does not 
happen without creativity for each. The pursuit of creativity 
for insufficient ideas is natural for Japan in the future, and 
the degeneration of the two elements for which we already have 
creative power must be avoided. 
  (New Technology Establishment News Group) Next published on 
28 September 
<H5>  Scenario </H5>
  In the year 20XX, Japan's technology balance of trade will 
have an excess of exports for the first time. This is twenty 
years after the economic sector such as the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren) founded four ``applied basic 
technology research institutes'' in separate production areas 
with joint contributions to plan for the strengthening of basic 
research fields. The basic technologies for biology, new metals, 
and environmental preservation developed here being successively 
industrialized and production patent registration increasing 
drastically in each enterprise was analyzed by the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology as a major reason. 
  Up to the 1990's, Japan's technology trade had an 
overwhelming excess of imports and the United States and Europe 
criticized Japan as a free rider. Those voices are no longer 
heard. 
  It is widely known that the medicines and biotechnology 
developed in the respective ``applied basic technology research 
institutes'' are regenerating the U.S. industry and contributing 
to U.S. development. Additionally, the workers and researchers 
in these research institutes also include many foreigners, 
especially persons from the United States and the people of the 
world have come to be aware that this is one international 
organization rather than a Japanese institution. 
  In the year following Japan's balance of technology trade 
becoming an excess of exports, in the General Assembly of the 
United Nations, Japan which is a permanent member of the 
Security Council proposed the foundation of such research 
organizations in developing nations and this was unanimously 
passed. 
  This was an attempt to predict the future of R&amp;D areas.

  [Text] This month, Tsukuba University started a unique 
system. The council which is the highest determining body of 
university management decided on observer participation of 
foreign professors; this is a very unusual attempt in national 
universities. Observers have no voting rights when determining 
important policies, but their proposals are recognized. At the 
council meeting held on 16 September, the designated Professor 
of Education Pak Son-u from Korea was the first to participate. 
Saying ``this is a `splendid deed' and also advances the 
internationalization of public universities which is lagging 
behind private universities,'' Professor Pak was frankly happy 
with his participation. 
  This system is the proposal of the school president Reona 
Esaki, aiming to actually ``to make a university with an 
international viewpoint.'' This is an idea much in keeping with 
Esaki who is well informed of world affairs, but other ideas 
aimed at developing international exchange without stopping here 
are concealed. 
  One of those is to extend the term of foreign professors 
which is currently a five year term. In calling for prominent 
scholars from foreign countries, the lifelong employment system 
will become an international custom. In the future, this will be 
deliberated in the council. 
  It has been one and a half years since Esaki, a Nobel Prize 
recipient, ended over thirty years living in the United States 
and took the position of president of Tsukuba University. The 
policies for ``activation of the university'' set forth since he 
took that position have taken the form of pledges.

Sunshine and Moonlight Plans 
  [1] Total investments in energy-related research and 
development in Japan during 1990 came to &yen;915.0 billion 
(7.5% of total R&amp;D investments for that year), of 
which 
&yen;402.1 billion (43.9%) went towards R&amp;D on 
nuclear power 
and the remaining &yen;512.9 billion (56.1%) was put 
towards 
non-nuclear power-related R&amp;D projects. 
  [2] The combined FY1990 budget for the Sunshine and 
Moonlight 
Plans, which are playing central roles in the research and 
development of renewable energy, coal conversion and energy 
conservation technologies, was 51.2 billion yen (&yen;39.6 
billion for the Sunshine Plan, and &yen;11.6 billion for the 
Moonlight Plan). This accounted for 39% of MITI's energy 
R&amp;D 
budget of &yen;129.9 billion for that fiscal year (52% of 
MITI's overall technology development budget), but only amounted 
to a mere 10% of Japan's total investments in non-nuclear 
energy R&amp;D for that period.

<H3>  II. Roles of Sunshine and Moonlight Plans in Sparking 
Related Research on the Part of Industry </H3>
  The combined R&amp;D budgets for the Sunshine and Moonlight 
Plans 
works out to just 10% of Japan's total investment in 
non-nuclear energy R&amp;D, but they have sparked strong R&amp;D 
investments in new energies and energy conservation on the part 
of industry and others. 



<H3>  III. Contributions Toward Increased Technology Stocks and 
Reduced Costs (Case of Solar Battery R&amp;D) </H3>
  As discussed above, energy R&amp;D under the Sunshine Plan 
is 
sparking related research on the part of industry, which is 
giving shape to the kind of favorable cycle we are witnessing in 
the field of solar batteries where increased stocks of energy 
technology held by industry are leading to increased production 
of ``new energy products,'' which in turn is steadily lowering 
costs, and this, in turn, is creating new demand (For example, 
61% of the cost reductions realized in the field of solar 
batteries between 198590 was attributed to technology 
development and another 22% to increased production.). 








<H5>  IV. Contributions Toward Reducing CO </H5>
[.sup]2[/] Emissions 
(In the case of the manufacturing industry) 
<H5>  (1) Factors Contributing Toward Reduced CO </H5>
[.sup]2[/] 
  Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the reduction in 
CO[.sup]2[/] emissions between 1970-90 (67% between 
1974-86) 
is attributed to energy conservation (This is followed by 
changes in the industrial structure (27%) and fuel 
conversions 
(12%)). 









<H3>  Contributions of the Sunshine/Moonlight Plans Toward Energy 
Conservation (CO </H3>
[.sup]2[/] Reductions) 
  The ability of the Sunshine and Moonlight Plans to spark 
industry-related energy R&amp;D is best seen in the progress 
made by 
the manufacturing industry in energy conservation, the key 
factor contributing to reductions in CO[.sup]2[/] emissions. 






  (Note 2) The remarkable impact on energy conservation 
described above was made possible via the following mechanisms. 
  [1] In response to tightened energy supply restrictions 
during the energy crises, Japan substituted other essential 
elements of the production process for energy in order to 
maintain sustained economic growth (We substituted technology 
(T), capital (K) and non-energy intermediate materials (M) for 
energy). 
  [2] The progress in energy conservation made during this 
period was the result of this substitution process, with the 
switch from energy to technology (E to T) forming the core of 
the process (This subsequently resulted in increased technology 
stocks and improved technology levels).[.sup]1)[/] 
  [3] The switch from energy to technology led to increased 
stocks of energy technology,[.sup]2)[/] with the Sunshine and 
Moonlight Plans contributing toward the increases in these 
stocks.

Increased Energy Technology Stocks: 1977-90]

<H3>  (Reference 3) R&amp;D Trends in Energy/Environmental 
Technology 
in the United States and Europe </H3>
<H5>  (1) Summary </H5>
  Although each nation differs as to the particular 
technology(ies) it is emphasizing and/or the degree to which it 
is increasing or decreasing its R&amp;D budget, the trend in 
energy 
technology R&amp;D among OECD member nations seems to be toward 
decreased R&amp;D budgets for nuclear power and increased budgets 
for the development of alternate energies, the enhancement of 
energy efficiency and R&amp;D into environmental countermeasures. 
<H5>  [1] Changes in Energy R&amp;D in the United States and Europe </H5>

  -  During the latter part of the 1980's, budgets slated for 
the development of energy-related technologies decreased in line 
with drops in petroleum prices. 
  -  Beginning around 1991, we have seen signs of a resurgence of 
interest in energy technology R&amp;D brought about by 
apprehensions 
concerning the stability of energy supplies as a result of the 
Gulf War and by heightened interest in global environmental 
problems. 
  -  Opportunities for advanced western nations to support the 
immature energy technologies of the central and eastern European 
countries are on the rise. 

<H5>    [2] Shifts in R&amp;D Priorities </H5>

  -  R&amp;D budgets for energy-related technologies did not 
increase much at all in 1991 compared to previous years, but we 
have seen a shift in R&amp;D priorities within the scope of these 
limited budgets. 
  -  There has been a steady shift in emphasis to ``green energy'' 
production, enhanced energy utilization efficiency and 
alternative fuels, as R&amp;D activities related to existing 
fossil 
fuels have tended to decrease. 
  -  Large nations are covering all the bases technologically, but 
smaller countries are carrying out R&amp;D focused on specific 
technologies that conform to their respective needs/resources. 
  -  Governments are in the process of withdrawing from R&amp;D 
fields 
that should be carried out by the private sector. 

<H5>    [3] R&amp;D on Environmental and Energy-related Technologies </H5>

  -  Emphasis is on lowering costs and eliminating 
technological barriers. 
  -  As a means of diversifying sources of energy and reducing 
their 
environmental impact on the greenhouse effect, all nations are 
striving to development renewable energies, a trend that is 
leading to successes in solar battery and wind energy 
technologies. 
  -  All nations are pushing forward with development work on fuel 
cell and heat pump technologies, and we are beginning to see 
some commercialization in these fields. In addition, various 
programs are being put together to promote R&amp;D efforts in the 
field of energy conservation in industry, transportation and etc. 
  -  Each nation in recent years has been placing emphasis on 
R&amp;D 
efforts aimed at developing technologies to counter the effects 
of energy utilization on the global environment, but research on 
carbon dioxide immobilization technologies is still in the basic 
stages. 
  -  Some countries have positioned their energy technology 
R&amp;D 
within the broader realm of R&amp;D tasks aimed at lowering the 
burden on the environment, however, the Sunshine Plan is the 
only example of a program that integrates R&amp;D on 
energy-related 
technologies with that of environmental technologies, and the 
IEA has begun to show interest in the thinking behind this plan.

<H5>  [7] Overview of R&amp;D Budgets of Seven Summit Nations </H5>
<H3>  A. Transitions of Government Energy R&amp;D Budgets and Their 
Breakdowns </H3>
  a. Government budgets for energy-related research in the 
seven (7) leading economic nations have remained relatively 
unchanged in recent years, with Japan (&yen;383 billion) and the 
United States, whose budget exceeded 2.5 billion dollars, heads 
and shoulders above the others in this category. 
  b. Broken down by research field, the percentage of funding 
going toward research in nuclear energy has risen across the 
board, with France and Japan jointly accounting for around 80 
percent of the total (Japan alone has invested over 2.0 billion 
dollars in nuclear energy research). The United States, Germany 
and Japan, in that order, lead the pack in terms of overall 
budgets slated for research on renewable energies, but Japan 
comes in fourth place in this field after Germany, the United 
Kingdom and Italy when it comes to actual R&amp;D funding. And 
Japan's budget for energy conservation research is 
overwhelmingly the lowest of any of the other nations at less 
than 1% (R&amp;D on fuel cell power generation technology 
under the 
auspices of the Moonlight Plan falls into a different category 
from electric energy conservation.). 






<H3>  B. Transition of Government Energy R&amp;D Budgets as a 
Percentage of GDP </H3>
  a. The leading nations in terms of R&amp;D budgets as a 
percentage of GDP for all forms of energy are Japan, Italy and 
Canada, respectively, but they are all showing a tendency to 
decline. 
  b. Broken down by energy field, Japan's 0.67 (as of FY1991; 
units: 0.01% [here and below]) is twice that of any of the 
other leading nations, and its 0.17 for non-nuclear energy 
R&amp;D 
budgets puts Japan in fourth place after Italy, Canada and the 
United States, in that order. 
  c. Germany is attracting attention for its tendency to 
increase its government R&amp;D budget as a percentage of GDP for 
renewable energies, while Japan, with its 0.03 is on a par with 
other nations in this category.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H3>  C. Transition of Energy-related R&amp;D Budgets as a 
Percentage 
of Government R&amp;D Budgets </H3>
  Japan's percentage of the government R&amp;D budget 
allotted to 
its energy R&amp;D budget far surpasses that of the other leading 
nations (four times those of the United States and Germany), but 
this is attributable almost entirely to Japan's nuclear power 
R&amp;D budget. In the area of non-nuclear energy R&amp;D 
budgets, 
Japan's percentage of its government R&amp;D budget works out to 
just 3.5%, putting it on practically the same level with 
the 
United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. 






  (3) Comparison and Contrast of Current State of R&amp;D in 
the 
Leading Nations 
  [1] Japan leads the rest of the world in the areas of fuel 
cell power generation technology, heat pump technology and 
CO[.sup]2[/] immobilization technology, and has attained 
technological prowess on a par with other world leaders in the 
areas of renewable energies and coal energy. 
  [2] The United States possesses the most advanced 
technologies in the fields of renewable energies and coal 
energy, and Germany's superconductive electrical generator 
technology is tops in the world. 
  [3] Together with the United States and Germany, Japan is 
playing a leading role in the research and development of 
energy-related technologies, making it vital that Japan carry 
out its R&amp;D activities efficiently, and exchange information 
and 
cooperate in research projects with other nations.

<H3>  (Supplement) R&amp;D Undertakings in the U.S. Related to 
Photovoltaic Power Generation. </H3>
  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has embarked on a 
long-term program called SOLAR 2000 aimed at pooling the assets 
of the national government, private industry and investors to 
bring about the early realization of full-scale 
commercialization of photovoltaic power generation. This is a 
three-pronged program comprising the following three (3) 
elements: 
  [1] Development of technology to enhance the efficiency and 
lower the costs of solar batteries, and to evaluate the 
performance and reliability of photovoltaic power generation 
systems (PV Systems); 
  [2] Creation of a favorable environment for the introduction 
of a PV system market; and 
  [3] Development projects designed to lighten the risks 
involved with the commercialization of PV systems from the 
standpoints of technology, construction/operation, regulation 
and financing.
