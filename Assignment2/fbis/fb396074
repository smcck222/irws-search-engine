<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Although the present photoexposure technology used in LSI 
manufacturing seems to be approaching its limits in terms of 
both resolution and depth of focus, attempts are being made to 
use DUV (deep UV) to fabricate the 0.2 to 0.25 Êm patterns 
required for the fabrication of 256M DRAMs. 
  Figure 1 [photo not reproduced] shows the 0.24 Êm 
L&amp;S 
pattern fabricated with a KrF excimer laser stepper using a 
Levenson-type phase-shifting mask. The stepper has an NA of 0.42 
and the resist is SNR-248 manufactured by Shipley. Figure 2 
shows the depths of focus (DOF) obtained at NAs from 0.4 to 0.6 
with I-ray and KrF excimer laser-light sources. Here, the DOF 
refers to the defocusing amount providing the optical image of 
an L&amp;S pattern with a contrast of 60 percent or more. This 
figure shows that, by adopting auxiliary means such as phase 
shifting,[.sup]1,2[/] various shapes of 
illumination,[.sup]3,4[/] and spatial filters[.sup]5[/] 
and exploiting new technology, the required degree of DOF can be 
obtained from 0.3 Êm patterns with I-rays and 0.2 Êm 
patterns with DUV. Consequently, there is a strong possibility 
that present photoexposure technology, with some improvements, 
can be used up to 256M DRAMs. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-01A>           Figure 2. Depths of Focus Simulated for NA = 0.4 to 0.6 </FIG>





  Even when the use of DUV may make manufacturing of 256M 
DRAMs 
possible in terms of resolution, it is expected that there will 
still be a limitation in terms of DOF margin and alignment 
accuracy. Also, further improvements in materials, processes, 
and cost are required to allow the use of DUV lithography in 
mass production. 
  The discussion in this report centers around these points. 
<H5>  DOF Margin </H5>
  As seen in Figure 2, DOF tends to decrease as the pattern 
gets finer. Nevertheless, a certain DOF margin is required to 
use the technology in mass production. Table 1 shows examples of 
the required DOF obtained on the basis of various 
factors[.sup]6,7[/] and the targets to be achieved in the 
near future. If a 0.2 Êm rule pattern is to be fabricated 
with 
a KrF excimer laser stepper, a decrease in the DOF is inevitable 
even when auxiliary means such as phase shifting is used, so it 
is necessary to reduce the DOF requirement to as low as 
possible. Factors involving DOF requirements include those 
associated with the wafer and those associated with the stepper, 
and the most important factor lies in device height differences 
on the wafer. While efforts have recently been made to reduce 
height differences, these are limited by device structures and 
cost. Wafer flatness has been improved in spite of increased 
diameter, but further improvements of the LTV is still 
desirable. Most of the factors associated with the stepper are 
related to image plane errors and the detection and reproduction 
accuracy of auto focusing. To deal with this, a method using 
multi-point focusing has been introduced to allow setting 
optimum focusing according to each device.[.sup]8[/] It is 
also desirable to improve the focusing detection and setting 
accuracy itself. The required DOF is the sum of these factors; 
presently about 2 Êm. If the target values can be achieved, 
the necessary DOF may be decreased to 1.2 Êm.

<H5>  Alignment Accuracy </H5>
  Alignment accuracy has a value of 30 percent to 40 percent 
of 
the minimum pattern width. If alignment accuracy does not 
improve as resolution improves, integration would be limited due 
to the necessity of alignment margin. Table 2 shows the present 
alignment accuracy and the target alignment accuracy for 256M 
DRAMs of each factor.[.sup]6,9[/] If the minimum pattern size 
of a 256M DRAM is 0.2 to 0.25 Êm, the required alignment 
accuracy is around 0.08 Êm.

  In the course of fabrication, the wafer is subject to 
nonlinear distortion, which results in alignment errors. An 
alignment technique which corrects high-order nonlinear 
distortion by optimizing the sampling shot and the weight of 
each mark[.sup]3[/] is one approach aimed at reducing this 
error. Mask pattern position errors are mainly caused by the 
method by which the mask is held during electron-beam etching, 
temperature changes, beam drift, deflection distortion and 
stage-moving errors. The error is reduced to one-fifth on the 
wafer, but this is still significant. 
  Lens distortion is a factor very difficult to reduce, but it 
cannot be ignored in stepper matching. As well as minimizing the 
distortion, it is desirable to provide a function to correct 
distortion up to a high order for each stepper. Various new 
methods have been developed to reduce alignment errors and 
further improvements are forthcoming to improve stage accuracy. 
  A recently released step-and-scan system 
aligner[.sup]10[/] detects and corrects alignment and 
focusing during scanning to improve accuracy. Because the 
factors determining alignment accuracy will be more obvious as 
the accuracy improves, it is expected that in the future it will 
be even more difficult to improve accuracy, and it will be 
necessary to approach the problem simultaneously from the device 
side, such as the use of a self-alignment structure. 
<H5>  Cost of DUV Lithography </H5>
  Figure 3 compares the calculated cost per layer of a single 
8-inch wafer with I-ray and KrF excimer laser lithographies, 
assuming that the cost of I-ray lithography is 1. Costs related 
to equipment include the equipment price (depreciation of the 
stepper, coater and developer), throughput, operating ratio, 
maintenance cost, consumables and equipment area (clean-room 
costs). The percentage of mask cost varies depending on the 
types and number of input wafers. Resist cost includes the 
prices of resists and developing solutions. As can be seen in 
the figure, present excimer laser lithography is very expensive. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-02A>           Figure 3. Example of Calculations of Cost per Layer of </FIG>




  Causes of the increased costs of excimer laser lithography 
are the stepper price, consumables, maintenance cost and 
installation area of excimer laser equipment. In the future, it 
is expected that excimer laser equipment cost will compete with 
I-ray steppers by reducing the equipment price through mass 
production and by increasing the service life and frequency band 
of the excimer laser. 
  Few excimer-laser resists are available on the market, their 
prices are high at the present, and a large price reduction by 
mass production is essential in the future. Mass production of 
excimer-laser resists may make it possible to reduce the cost 
below that of I-ray lithography, which uses phase-shifting 
techniques. 
<H5>  Lithography Technologies After 0.2 Êm </H5>
  Candidates being studied as lithography technologies after 
0.2 Êm include the use of ArF excimer laser light with a 
short 
wavelength of 193 nm, the use of VUV (Vacuum Ultra Violet) light 
emitted from an SR (Synchrotron Radiation) light source, the use 
of soft X-rays, and the electron beam drawing method. However, 
the use of short-wavelength light sources raises the problem of 
light absorption by optical components and resist; the use of 
X-rays is accompanied by the problem of mask fabrication 
accuracy due to its equal-magnification transfer; and the use of 
electron beam drawing is accompanied by problems in throughput 
and drawing accuracy. It is left for future research to identify 
if the lithography after the 0.2 Êm rule can be an extension 
of the present photoexposure system, or whether a change to 
another technique is necessary. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The 0.2 to 0.25 Êm rule lithography required for 256M 
DRAMs 
may be dealt with by improving present photoexposure technology, 
but further improvements in equipment and devices are required 
in areas such as depth of focus and alignment accuracy. With 
regard to costs, price reduction is required through the mass 
production of equipment, maintenance, and materials. Although 
not mentioned in the above, improvements in processes such as 
the implementation of simple ARC (anti-reflection coating) are 
also important. It is desirable that these problems be 
surmounted by closer cooperation among the equipment, material, 
and device manufacturers.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  As we enter the age of 0.25 Êm or below, more accurate 
etching technology is required. However, this technology is 
still in large part dependent on empirical factors, hence a 
scientific approach is difficult. This is because the plasma 
states and surface reactions are extremely complicated and there 
are not many means to analyze them. Even though our 
understanding is insufficient, plasma can be generated 
relatively easily and a very active state can be produced. 
However, various equipment using different methods has been 
introduced, adding to the confusion. Nevertheless, it seems the 
appropriate time to start discussions and studies for the 
ultrafine fabrication of 0.25 Êm and below. 
  This report reviews the items required for etching equipment 
for 256M DRAMs and beyond. 
<H5>  High-Density Plasma Source </H5>
  Most active discussions about etching equipment are related 
to the plasma source. Previously, a low-pressure, high-density 
plasma source always referred to ECR plasma. Now, a variety of 
plasma sources, including helicon-wave and inductive-discharge 
(Figures 1 and 2) have been developed and introduced in the 
market. Helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma use 
the RF frequency band at around 10 MHz and do not require a 
ferromagnetic field, so they can be implemented with compact 
size and simplified design. On the other hand, they have 
problems controlling the discharge state due to insufficient 
understanding of the mechanism of plasma generation. It has also 
been pointed out that their large-surface electric fields and 
plasma potentials sputter or etch the walls, influencing the 
etching characteristic of substrates. On the other hand, with 
ECR plasma, progress has been made in the analysis of the plasma 
state and elucidation of the discharge mechanism, and 
optimization of the plasma state is very advanced. However, the 
use of microwave and ferromagnetic fields makes the equipment 
large and complicated. Another problem is the production of 
abnormal etched shapes on the gate electrodes, as shown in 
Figure 3, which occurs when electric charge is accumulated on 
the wafer because the capture rates of electrons and ions with 
respect to the field are different, such as in the case of the 
presence of a ferromagnetic field on the wafer.[.sup]1[/] 
Therefore, with ECR plasma, reduction of the magnetic field on 
the wafer electrode and size reduction are important topics to 
be considered. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04A>           Figure 1. Helicon-Wave Plasma Source (mfd. Plasma </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04B>            Figure 2. Inductive Discharge Plasma Source (mfd. by </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-04C>           Figure 3. Abnormally Etched Shapes in Poly-Si </FIG>




  As seen above, each plasma source has its merits and 
demerits. Nevertheless, when the equipment for manufacturing 
256M and later DRAMs is considered, the trends of increasing the 
number of chambers and clustering are necessary, together with 
increasing wafer size. Further, a compact, simplified plasma 
source is necessary on actual mass-production lines. This means 
that size reduction is a necessary condition for ECR plasma 
sources to survive. This topic should be studied along with the 
decrease of applied frequency.[.sup]2[/] On the other hand, 
with helicon-wave plasmas and inductive-discharge plasmas, the 
optimization of plasma and optimization of hardware would be 
important issues in the future. 
  As described above, a variety of plasma sources have been 
developed and currently low-pressure, high-density plasmas have 
become the leaders in the etching process. However, it is 
becoming clear that high-density plasma is not always 
beneficial, as some problems have emerged due to the high 
density. Not all the active species in plasma contribute to the 
etching reaction; some of them produce the main reaction and 
others inhibit it. For example, polymerization in the etching of 
oxide film is determined by the ratio between the 
CF[.sup]2[/] radicals and F atoms in fluorocarbon plasma. The 
CF[.sup]2[/] radicals are the precursor of polymerization and 
F atoms function to inhibit polymerization. Therefore, to 
achieve highly selective oxide-film etching, the 
F/CF[.sup]2[/] radical-density ratio in the plasma should be 
low. However, in low-pressure, high-density plasmas, such as ECR 
plasma, helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma, high 
electron temperatures and the occurrence of highly dissociative 
reactions tend to make polymerization inadequate due to a low 
CF[.sup]2[/] radical density. This poses problems such as a 
low etching selectivity with respect to silicon 
wafers.[.sup]3[/] To solve these problems while maintaining 
the benefits of low-pressure, high-density plasma, it is 
important to control the electron temperature and dissociative 
reaction in plasma. Controlling the generation of active species 
by pulse-modulated plasma was recently proposed as a method to 
solve these problems.[.sup]4[/] 
  In manufacturing 256M and later DRAMs, it is desirable that 
these problems be solved at the plasma source. Regardless, the 
mixed presence of a variety of plasma sources is not favorable 
for users, because this situation will require much effort in 
equipment selection and process development. A valuable future 
topic would be to identify the optimum plasma state for each 
type of material and develop a standardized plasma source that 
can achieve that state. 
<H5>  Role of the Chamber Wall </H5>
  Although chamber wall material and chamber size are very 
important factors relating to plasma, they have not been studied 
sufficiently. Wall material and wall potential states 
(grounding, floating) have a great effect on the plasma's 
potential distribution and charged particle decay times. As they 
vary, the electron loss probability on the wall surface, the 
electron temperature in plasma, plasma potential, and floating 
potential are also varied so the ion impact state onto the wall 
is also varied. In addition, as the reactivities of active 
species (radicals, ions) are variable depending on the wall 
materials, as shown in Figure 4, their loss and adsorption 
probabilities are also varied which varies the percentage of 
active species existing in the plasma.[.sup]5[/] This is why 
it is said that the reproducibility of plasma processes is 
largely affected by the wall. Therefore, the selection of wall 
material and its electric state are also important themes for 
equipment implementation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-05A>           Figure 4. Variation of Radical Density Depending on Wall </FIG>




  Chamber size is also important. Chamber size increases when 
the size of the wafer is increased, and the increase in chamber 
size means a relative increase in the volume of plasma with 
respect to the wall, providing the benefits of reduced electron 
loss and lower plasma potential and electron temperature. 
Therefore, the optimization of chamber size is also an important 
topic to be considered. 
<H5>  Exhaust System </H5>
  The exhaust system is noteworthy from the viewpoint of 
controlling the residence time of reaction products as well as 
controlling the degree of etching vacuum. Since the gas flow 
varies the residence time of reaction products and thereby the 
etching characteristic as shown in Figure 5.[.sup]6[/] 
Exhaust system design is an important element in the design of 
etching equipment. Equipment design must take conductance into 
full consideration, as well as the exhaust rate of the 
turbo-molecular pump. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-05B>           Figure 5. Variation of Etching Characteristic Depending on </FIG>




<H5>  Multi-Chamber Equipment </H5>
  Microfabrication and the multi-layer structure of devices 
are 
making the etching process increasingly complicated. As a 
result, it has sometimes become necessary to apply pre- and 
post-processing to etching, use processes for etching layered 
film with several gas systems, or process several large-size 
wafers simultaneously. An increase in the number of chambers is 
indispensable to achieve these. In addition, as continuous 
processing in vacuum is essential to process reproducibility, 
the implementation of equipment as standardized cluster tools is 
also necessary. This is an important subject which could lead to 
the standardization of etching equipment. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In the above I reviewed the points concerning etching 
equipment expected for use for 256M DRAMs and later. The 
extremely stringent accuracy requirements for etching have made 
it necessary to conduct an advanced study of the equipment. This 
requires an approach to the plasma process aimed at achieving 
optimum cost efficiency and expected characteristics. Equipment 
standardization has also become an important topic. These 
requirements are extremely severe for equipment manufacturers, 
and I hope our research will contribute to their efforts.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Resist removal at the final stage of a lithography process 
is 
one of the best-known processes in LSI manufacturing. Resist is 
usually removed by dry/wet processes. The technology for dry 
removal of resist using oxygen plasma (hereinafter referred to 
as ashing) has been used widely for more than a decade. Problems 
in the ashing process include damage such as charge-up and metal 
contamination, and the ashing residue. This report describes 
ashing technologies usable with 256M DRAMs. 
<H5>  Damage </H5>
  Damage produced in the ashing process can be divided into 
four categories: metal contamination, charge-up, ion impact 
damage, and UV irradiation damage. Each of these will be 
described below. 
<H5>  1. Metal Contamination </H5>
  When an alkali metal (usually Na) is implanted in 
SiO[.sup]2[/] during ashing, mobile ions are generated 
varying the threshold voltage of MOS transistors. Similarly, the 
implantation of heavy metal in an Si wafer or Si[.sup]2[/] 
causes stacking faults, or a deterioration of the withstand 
voltage of the gate-oxide film of MOS transistors. It is agreed 
that the target value of metal contamination with 256M DRAMs 
should be no more than 1 x 10[.sup]9[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. 
  With ashing using oxygen plasma, the metal oxides in the 
resist cannot be removed due to the low vapor pressure, and 
hence remain on the wafer surface. There are even cases in which 
the metal penetrates the oxide film, depending on the processing 
condition of the ashing. The major causes of this are ion impact 
(knock-on), charge-up, and temperature, but the detailed 
mechanism is not yet known. 
  Success in the reduction of metal contamination lies in 
reducing the influence of charged particles, so the use of 
down-flow ashing or ozone ashing is optimum for this purpose. 
From the viewpoint of the process, studying the addition of 
H[.sup]2[/]O,[.sup]1[/] or low-temperature ashing may be 
necessary. 
<H5>  2. Charge-Up </H5>
  In the ashing process, charged particles in the plasma cause 
charge-up and degrade the withstand voltage of the gate 
insulation film. This charge-up can be evaluated by measuring 
the V[.sup]fb[/] shift of MNOS diodes. With this method, 
after previously identifying the relationship between the 
voltage applied to the gate of MNOS diodes, V[.sup]a[/], and 
the V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]), the relative 
potential and polarity of the gate electrode with respect to the 
Si wafer is estimated from _D_V[.sup]fb[/] after plasma 
processing. Figure 1 shows the structure of an MNOS diode, and 
Figure 2 shows the relationship between the voltage applied to 
the gate of an MNOS diode, V[.sup]a[/], and the 
V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]) when the voltage 
application period is 1 minute. The detection limit in 
_D_V[.sup]fb[/] evaluation is variable depending on the 
sample structure and measuring method, but in general it is +/- 
0.1 V with _D_V[.sup]fb[/]. Among the currently available 
ashing equipment, the equipment with _D_V[.sup]fb[/] within 
+/- 0.1 V uses the down-flow system as with coaxial ashing 
equipment (with the electrode design optimized) and microwave 
down-flow ashing equipment (with the chamber structure 
optimized) or does not use plasma as with ozone ashing 
equipment. The equipment providing smaller _D_V[.sup]fb[/], 
while performing ashing processing in plasma, includes the 
helical asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/] Û +/- 0.25 V) and microwave 
asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/] Û 0.4 V). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07A> Figure 1. Structure of MNOS Diode </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07A> Figure 2. Relationship Between Voltage Applied to MNOS </FIG>




  With ashing equipment using capacity-coupling RF plasma or 
surface-wave microwave plasma,[.sup]2[/] it is necessary to 
reduce charge-up by applying the down-flow system in which the 
wafer is separated from the plasma discharge area, or by 
improving the uniformity of plasma density through the 
optimization of the equipment or process. 
<H5>  3. Ion Impact Damage </H5>
  Ion impacts cause the knock-on of metals, sputtering and 
crystal defects. Ion impact energy is determined by the 
difference between the plasma potential and wafer potential. 
Crystal defects can be evaluated by thermal wave measurement. 
Figure 3 shows the results of thermal wave measurements by 
irradiating four kinds of plasma. The down-flow (coaxial) ashing 
equipment presents an identical thermal wave signal level to the 
reference; the microwave ashing equipment, which exposes the 
wafer to plasma, increases the signal level slightly; and the 
O[.sup]2[/] RIE equipment (V[.sub]DC[/] = -100 V), which 
uses a large ion impact energy, increases the signal level 
drastically. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-07B> Figure 3. Thermal Wave Signals of Various </FIG>




<H5>   4. UV Irradiation Damage </H5>
  When vacuum UV rays (_l_ = 140 nm or less) above the band 
gap 
energy of SiO[.sup]2[/] (8.8 eV) is irradiated, electron-hole 
pairs are produced in SiO[.sup]2[/] and the holes are trapped 
near the interfaces.[.sup]3[/] It has also been reported 
that, in a photo-etching experiment, neutral traps were produced 
by etching using UV rays with _l_ = 194 nm.[.sup]4[/] 
  As seen from the above, it is desirable to avoid UV rays 
with 
_l_ = 200 nm or less as much as possible. 
<H5>  Problems in Resist Removal </H5>
  As it is said that particles of more than one-fifth to 
one-tenth the minimum fabrication size degrade the device 
characteristics and decrease yield, the production of particles 
with diameters of more than 0.05 to 0.02 Êm should be 
minimized with 256M DRAMs (0.25 to 0.20 Êm process). There 
has 
been little research on the removal of these particles 
(residues) in ashing, but the basic orientation may be to use 
ashing for the removal of organic components (resist) and use a 
wet process for the removal of inorganic components (metals, 
etc.), contained in the resist. (It is desirable that ashing 
turns the inorganic components into a state easily removable by 
a wet process at the same time as removing the organic 
components.) 
  Resist removal by the ashing process is specially difficult 
in cases where the resist is hard to release due to modification 
after high-dose ion implantation, for example, and in cases 
where the reaction products attached during etching remain as 
residues after aluminum etching or gate etching. These examples 
will be described in detail below. 
<H5>  1. Resist Removal After High-Dose Ion Implantation </H5>
  When high-dose ions are implanted using a positive resist as 
the mask, the rise in temperature due to ion impact degrades the 
resist surface, causing a drastic drop in the ashing rate in 
cases where the ashing is based on oxygen radicals. If ashing is 
processed at high temperature to increase the ashing rate, a 
phenomenon in which the resist splits into small pieces 
(pumping) occurs, and the resist turns into a state in which 
complete removal is impossible (a state in which oxidation is 
difficult). 
  Figure 4 [photos not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM 
micrograph after the pumping of a resist. The pumping is 
considered to be due to the emission of N[.sup]2[/] or other 
degases from the lower part of the resist that has not been 
degraded by high-temperature ashing. The pumping can be 
prevented by eliminating the gases in the resist by applying UV 
curing or hard baking to the resist before ion implantation. 
However, a fine residue is produced in the case of ashing based 
on oxygen radicals, even after UV curing or hard baking. For the 
present, such residue is removed by post-cleaning. 
  The most effective method to remove the degenerated layer on 
the surface is ashing using the reaction with ion impact. It has 
been reported that H[.sup]2[/]O + H[.sub]2[/] RIE is 
capable of complete dry removal of ion-implanted 
resist.[.sup]5[/] However, as plasma processing, such as RIE, 
is accompanied by the potential of charge-up, ion impact damage, 
and contamination due to the chamber, such damage must be 
reduced. 
<H5>  2. Resist Release After Aluminum Etching </H5>
  Figure 5 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM 
micrograph of the result of ashing with O[.sup]2[/] plasma 
after aluminum etching. The residue shown in the photo is a 
compound of the aluminum sputtered during etching. A similar 
residue is also produced after via hole etching. 
  Figure 6 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM 
micrograph after via hole etching. This residue has previously 
been removed by ashing and a chemical solution process, but it 
has recently been reported that it can be removed by F + 
H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and pure water 
processing.[.sup]6[/] 
  The proposed mechanism is to substitute the aluminum 
compound 
with fluoride by F + H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and 
dissolve it in pure water. 
  To deal with aluminum corrosion, a system has been 
implemented in which the etching equipment, ashing equipment, 
and wet tank are coupled to perform resist removal continuously 
in vacuum. 
<H5>  3. Resist Release After Gate Etching </H5>
  Highly selective etching of poly-Si uses HBr gas. When 
poly-Si etched with an HBr-type gas is ashed with O[.sup]2[/] 
plasma, a residue is produced on the resist 
sidewalls.[.sup]7[/] This residue is silicon oxide film 
produced when SiBr[.sup]x[/] deposited during etching reacts 
in the atmosphere. A similar residue is also observed in 
low-temperature etching of poly-Si using Cl[.sup]2[/] 
gas.[.sup]8[/] This residue can be removed by wet etching 
(SiO[.sup]2[/]) but removal through ashing is being studied 
to reduce the decrease of the film on the base SiO[.sup]2[/]. 
There has been a report that it can be removed by O[.sup]2[/] 
+ CF[.sup]4[/] down-flow ashing. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Ashing methods which do not damage devices of the 256M DRAM 
class may be low-temperature ashing of the down-flow or 
ozone-type which cuts UV rays of _l_ = 200 nm or less. 
  Reduction of fine residue (with diameters of 0.05 to 0.02 
Êm or more) is a concept left for the future. 
  Resist remaining after high-dose ion implantation can be 
removed either by the complete-removal method using plasma or by 
the method using ashing (down-flow or ozone system) based on 
oxygen radicals by combining post-processing such as UV curing 
and hard baking and post-cleaning. One of these methods may be 
selected depending on the reduction of fine residue and damage 
in the equipment using plasma. 
  There are cases in which reaction products deposited during 
etching tend to remain as residue after post-etching resist 
release. A method of adding fluorine-type gas has been proposed 
to remove the residue, but since the addition of such gas 
results in etching of Si and SiO[.sup]2[/], this requires an 
improved selection ratio (with respect to Si and 
SiO[.sup]2[/]), an improved ashing rate, uniformity, and 
stable end-point detection. As the production of residue after 
post-etching resist release is in large part affected by the 
etching technology, new problems are expected to occur as 
etching technology changes in the future.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Ion implantation equipment has advanced following the 
increased density of DRAMs, which are the leading devices 
fabricated using ultra-large-scale integration. Figure 1 shows 
the changes in the design rule, wafer size, and ion implantation 
technology used with each generation of DRAMs. In recent years, 
oblique rotation implantation equipment has been put to 
practical use with medium-current machines, and parallel-beam 
equipment has also been developed. With large-current machines, 
the electron shower has been improved to reduce charge-up and a 
high-performance plasma flood gun has been developed. 
High-energy (up to MeV) ion implanters have passed the R&amp;D 
stage 
and are now starting to be used in mass production. In addition 
to the above, 256M DRAMs with more advanced microminiaturization 
require the improvement of low-energy implantation performance 
for the fabrication of shallow junctions. Previous technological 
trends -- that is the requirements to reduce the particles, 
contamination and charge-up, and improve implantation accuracy 
-- will become more severe following the microminiaturization of 
devices and the increase in wafer size. On the other hand, in 
actual equipment operation, improvements in the basic 
performance of production facilities such as automation, higher 
operating ratios, and easy maintenance will also be important. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-09A>           Figure 1. Different DRAM Generations and Changes in Ion </FIG>




  This report describes the requirements of these items from 
the user perspective for the ion implantation equipment to be 
used with 256M DRAMs. 
<H5>  Low-Energy Implantation </H5>
  Technology for the fabrication of shallow junctions is 
important for 256M DRAMs with a junction depth of about 0.1 
Êm. Formation of junctions in the particularly shallow 
p[.sup]+[/] layer is difficult and has been dealt with by 
BF[.sup]2[/] implantation[.sup]1[/] or pre-amorphizing 
implantation.[.sup]2,3[/] The BF[.sup]2[/] implantation is 
advantageous with its possibilities of lowering the virtual 
acceleration energy and increasing the beam current. However, 
its use in processes is restricted due to such problems as the 
roughness of high-melting-point metal surfaces due to 
fluorine[.sup]4[/] or the segregation of fluorine, which was 
redistributed during annealing, in residual defects near the 
interface between the amorphous layer and single 
crystals.[.sup]5[/] Pre-amorphizing can be achieved by a 
method using Si or Ge[.sup]2[/] or a method using 
N[.sup]3[/] but in any case B[.sup]3[/] should be 
implanted at no more than 10 keV to obtain shallow junctions. 
However, if implantation energy is decreased using a 
conventional, electrostatic-scanning-type medium-current 
machine, the in-plane uniformity deteriorates as shown in Figure 
2(a). This is thought to be because the in-beam charge density 
becomes non-uniform as the beam expands during beam travel. In 
addition, medium-current machines with parallel-beam 
implantation are also required to maintain beam parallelism at 
low energy. On the other hand, large-current machines also have 
problems in the decrease of beam current and drop of throughput 
when the implantation energy is decreased as shown in Figure 
2(b). With large-current machines, it is desirable to develop 
equipment which allows uniform implantation and high throughput 
even at low energy. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10A>           Figure 2. Implantation Energy Dependence of Ion </FIG>




<H5>  Charge-Up </H5>
  Electrostatic breakdown due to charge-up is dependent on the 
device structure, manufacturing flow, and ion-implantation 
conditions. Increase in integration scale makes the gate-oxide 
film thinner and gate area smaller, and the increase in wafer 
size requires implantation with a larger beam current to assure 
the required throughput. These factors are intensifying the 
problem of electrostatic breakdown. 
  To reduce electrostatic breakdown, attempts have been made 
to 
reduce the charge density of the ion beam in ion implantation 
equipment by neutralizing charges with an electron shower and 
enlarging the ion beam diameter. The first electron showers 
developed irradiated the target with primary electrons and 
supplied the generated secondary electrons to the wafer. 
However, problems have been found with the re-entry of primary 
electrons with high energy, and in the response of the feedback 
control of the amount of irradiation. To deal with these 
problems, methods are being studied for preventing the arrival 
of high-energy electrons at the wafer by applying a magnetic or 
electric field[.sup]6,7[/] and a plasma-flood method which 
produces plasma near the wafer to prevent its charge-up with 
electrons. The plasma-flood method is attractive in principle 
because it allows neutralization using low-energy electrons 
alone, and can assure a wide process margin without complicated 
condition setting. Conversely, additional study is required on 
the influence of generating a plasma near the wafer. Figure 3 
shows an example of reduction of electrostatic breakdown using a 
plasma flood gun,[.sup]8[/] which has provided favorable 
results. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10B>           Figure 3. Reduction of Electrostatic Breakdown Using </FIG>




  Enlarging the beam diameter is also effective for reducing 
electrostatic breakdown, and equipment should be designed 
considering contamination due to sputtering in the beam line. 
<H5>  Particles and Contamination </H5>
  About 80 to 90 percent of defects in DRAMs from 64M to 256M 
are due to particles on the wafer or its contamination by 
metals. It is also said that 95 percent of all particles at the 
256M DRAM level may be derived from the manufacturing equipment. 
Every equipment manufacturer has expended special efforts to 
ensure clean manufacturing, but as microminiaturization 
advances, particle control should involve smaller particle sizes 
and the equipment to meet this requirement. Figure 4 illustrates 
changes over time of the particles of specific implantation 
equipment. Particle control, considering particle diameters of 
0.3 Êm or more, may not identify any abnormality because it 
does not find a variation in the number of particles, but an 
increase in the number of particles due to an abnormality in a 
certain period can be identified by monitoring particles with 
diameters of 0.17 Êm or more. As seen here, without due 
control and reduction by monitoring even very fine particles, 
the yield could drop while the cause would not be identified. 
The measurement of the number of particles gets difficult as the 
particle size decreases but, as it has been reported based on 
experience, even particles of around one-tenth the minimum size 
of the device can cause an adverse effect.[.sup]9[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-10C>           Figure 4. Changes in Number of Particles of Ion </FIG>




  It is well known that contamination by metals such as Fe, 
Cr, 
Ni, and Al in general increases the junction leakage current. 
The advancement of microminiaturization toward the 256M DRAM 
will increase the sensitivity to contamination due to shallower 
junctions and a smaller peripheral length reduction 
ratio.[.sup]10[/] This problem will increase if 
low-temperature annealing, which can reduce impurity diffusion, 
is used to form shallow junctions. Figure 5 shows an example in 
which metal contamination is reduced by covering with Si the 
part that would be sputtered by the ion beam. It achieved a low 
leakage current of 10[.sup]-7[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/] even with 
low-temperature annealing at 500ÎC.[.sup]11[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-11A>           Figure 5. Reverse Current Density at n[.sup]+[/]p </FIG>




  Device microminiaturization will continue to drive the 
battle 
against particle and metal contamination. 
<H5>  Wafer Size Increase </H5>
  Wafers with 8-inch or larger diameters will be used in the 
age of 256M DRAMs and it is highly probable that 12-inch wafers 
will be used in mass production.[.sup]12[/] To maintain the 
in-plane uniformities of the implantation quantity and depth 
even with large-size wafers, technology for aligning the ion 
beam incident angle in the wafer plane is essential for 
medium-current machines using ion-beam scanning. Reducing the 
in-plane variations in incident angle by using a longer beam 
line is advantageous in terms of its lower price but, when 
equipment size and performance are taken into consideration, the 
predominant equipment used in the future will be parallel-beam 
equipment. 
<H5>  Basic Performance of Production Facilities </H5>
  Apart from the requirements for 256M DRAM-compatible ion 
implantation equipment from the viewpoint of process technology 
as described above, it is also important to improve the basic 
performance of ion implantation equipment by recognizing that it 
is a production facility. 
  To improve the operating ratio, what is required is to 
reduce 
the failure frequency and to extend the service life of the ion 
source. Reduction of the failure frequency may not need any 
explanation. Extension of the service life of the ion source has 
been attempted by extending filament life, but the implantation 
capability of recent equipment is often affected by discharges 
due to contamination inside the ion source as well as the 
filament life. Future improvements should take this into 
consideration. 
  While equipment automation has progressed, the error rate in 
the auto mode is so high that the reliability is not sufficient 
for use in automated fabrication in the age of the 256M DRAMs. 
This is not only due to software; errors also occur due to 
matching errors between software and hardware resulting from 
deviations in hardware adjustment. A reliable automated 
hardware/software system is necessary if the industry is to move 
forward. 
  As for the processing capacity, while the equipment is 
operating the processing capacity is determined by such factors 
as wafer transportation, beam set-up, implantation operation and 
beam shut-down. Of these, the operation which presently takes 
the most time is automatic beam set-up. This is especially true 
in the R&amp;D line where continuous processing of several lots 
using the same implantation condition is rather rare, and much 
time is required for auto set-up every time the implantation 
condition is to be changed. Also, as the source condition varies 
gradually during use, there are cases in which the beam will not 
start smoothly with the initially set parameters. To allow quick 
auto-beam start-up regardless of source condition changes in 
time, a measure such as the provision of learning functions may 
be necessary. Obviously, there is much room for automation 
improvement. 
  It is almost needless to mention that for size reduction, 
operability and equipment safety are important. Recent equipment 
features better operability in the stationary state thanks to 
touch-screen input and various monitoring systems; operability 
and safety in non-stationary states such as during maintenance 
should also be considered. The equipment must be made 
user-friendly, for example, by designating the points where 
periodical maintenance is required to relieve operators of that 
concern. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We described above the performance required for 256M 
DRAM-compatible ion implantation equipment from the user 
standpoint. From the viewpoint of process technology, the 
important topic is to improve the low-energy implantation 
performance as well as the extensions of previous technological 
trends such as dust generation reduction, contamination 
reduction, charge-up reduction and implantation accuracy 
improvement. From the production viewpoint, the pursuit of 
improved reliability including reduced failure rate and ion 
source-life extension, automation, improved operability and 
greater safety is desirable.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The development of DRAMs, the leading vehicle of the 
semiconductor industry, has become more active, and 64M DRAMs 
have already been commercialized. Currently, active R&amp;D is 
being 
conducted into 256M DRAMs featuring a higher scale of 
integration. 
  Manufacturing such ultra-large-scale integration silicon 
devices requires highly reliable manufacturing process 
technology with controlled surface, interface, and film quality. 
Oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD technologies are no exception 
and are being subjected to various requirements for improvement. 
  Figure 1 shows the design rule, junction depth, gate-oxide 
film thickness, and capacitance insulation film thickness of 
each generation of DRAM. The design rule values of 0.25 Êm, 
junction depth of 0.075 Êm, and gate insulation film 
thickness 
of 80 angstroms almost satisfy the actual trend. On the other 
hand, the thickness reduction of capacitance insulation film has 
been made less demanding by combining it with a 
three-dimensional electrode with increased electrode surface 
area. It is now possible to use silicon nitride capacitance film 
with a film thickness (when converted to oxide film thickness) 
of about 40 angstroms as the capacitance insulation film of 256M 
DRAMs, provided that the film has a good coating characteristic. 
On the other hand, highly dielectric film appears to be a 
promising technology for reducing the number of manufacturing 
processes, hence its development is presently being studied. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-13A>           Figure 1. Trend of Microminiaturization of DRAMs </FIG>




  The necessary conditions for equipment used in manufacturing 
256M DRAMs are: First, high-reliability technology compatible 
with the fabrication of ultra-large-scale integrated devices 
should be established and mass-producible equipment should be 
developed to implement them. Second, equipment compatible with 
an increased wafer size accompanying the increase in chip size 
and cost reduction should be developed. Nevertheless, if the 
wafer size increase leads to a rise in equipment cost or a drop 
in throughput, the purpose of equipment development itself would 
be lost. Third, the equipment cost and failure rate should be 
decreased by simplifying the equipment and promoting 
standardization. Presently, manufacturing equipment is getting 
more complicated by an increased number of components. This is 
the result of the implementation of accumulated equipment 
experience. But, in the future, it is necessary to promote the 
simplification of equipment by identifying the essence of each 
process and emphasizing only the required functions. As well as 
reducing the number of components, it is also important to 
standardize equipment and components. By making such efforts it 
will be possible to reduce failure rate and the maintenance time 
even when the throughput is increased and clustering, which is 
effective in interface and surface control, is used. 
  There are many problems to be solved in the development of 
equipment as seen above, and this report discusses the required 
measures to solve them by enumerating some of the concepts and 
topics related to the technology for the fabrication of thin 
films and shallow junctions required to manufacture 256M DRAMs. 
<H5>  Annealing Equipment </H5>
  Following the reduction of device size, the formation of 
shallow junctions and the reduction of the redistribution of 
impurities are required more urgently than before. Presently, 
impurities are mainly introduced by ion implantation. However, 
because activation processing and damage recovery after ion 
implantation require highly accurate control of temperature, 
time, and atmosphere, resistance-heating-type electric furnaces 
currently used are approaching their technical limits. This is 
because the individual wafers have different thermal hysteresis 
if they are transported in batches to the electric furnace, and 
reduction of thermal hysteresis is difficult. 
  RTP (rapid thermal processing) is utilized as the technology 
for compensating for this limitation of electric furnaces. RTP 
provides good throughput because it can activate impurities in a 
short period and it causes little diffusion of impurities as 
shown in Figure 2.[.sup]1[/] In addition, because of the 
advantages in its ability to handle wafers with increased size, 
this technology will be indispensable for manufacturing 256M 
DRAMs. However, its cold-wall design tends to radiate a great 
deal of heat from the wafer edges during heating, and uniformity 
in the wafer plane is difficult to achieve, sometimes causing 
crystal defects during heating. In addition, while the 
temperature is in general controlled by observing the infrared 
rays from the back of the wafer using a pyrometer, the infrared 
ray emission rate is often variable depending on the condition 
of the back of the wafer. Although RTP has already been put to 
practical use in some areas, there are many problems yet to be 
solved. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-13B>           Figure 2. Results of Experiments and Calculations on Depth </FIG>




  RTP equipment has better properties than conventional 
electric furnaces as described above but, when considering 
throughput and other factors, the electric furnace is still 
superior in many processes and it is expected that the use of 
electric furnaces will continue in the fabrication of wells. The 
batch-type rapid thermal processing furnace which has been 
gathering interest[.sup]2[/] has the potential for providing 
the advantages of both RTP equipment and batch processing 
equipment and could be an effective method for fabricating 256M 
DRAMs in the future. 
<H5>  LP-CVD Equipment </H5>
  Among the LP-CVD technologies to be used with 256M DRAMs, 
those which especially need improvements in the process 
equipment are the fabrication of ultrathin insulation film with 
excellent coating such as capacitance film, and the fabrication 
of silicon film used in wiring and electrode manufacture. The 
discussion that follows will focus on these technologies. 
<H5>  1. Capacitance Insulation Film Fabrication Equipment </H5>
  Devices such as 256M DRAMs require thin film with a 
thickness 
of less than 40 angstroms, which is close to the physical limit, 
even if three-dimensional electrodes are combined as was 
described earlier. Control of natural-oxide film on the 
electrode surfaces is critical for the fabrication of such thin 
films. 
  Natural-oxide film is formed in the cleaning process, during 
exposure to the atmosphere between processes, and when the wafer 
is put into the nitride film deposition furnace. Active attempts 
have been made to reduce natural-oxide film growth during the 
furnace input operation through improvements in the equipment 
and pre-processing methods. 
  Development of LP-CVD equipment with a load-lock mechanism 
has also been undertaken to prevent atmospheric penetration 
during the furnace input operation.[.sup]3[/] This method 
replaces the wafer atmosphere in the leak-tight load-lock 
chamber with a high vacuum or high-purity inert gas atmosphere 
before transporting the wafer into the furnace. 
  From the viewpoint of process improvement, a method for 
reducing the natural-oxide film growth by applying RTN (rapid 
thermal nitridation) before input to the LP-CVD furnace has also 
been reported.[.sup]4[/] 
  These measures have been very effective in reducing 
natural-oxide film growth in the furnace, but could not remove 
natural-oxide film completely. Complete removal requires an 
in-situ oxide film-removal process and atmospheric-control 
technology with the oxygen partial pressure reduced below 
10[.sup]-6[/] Torr. 
  To make this possible, equipment is being developed which 
provides high-vacuum modules and combines several process 
modules called cluster tools. Also under development is 
equipment performing several processes in a single-process 
module. 
  With the general structure used by cluster tools, the 
natural-oxide film is removed in the pre-processing module 
installed inside the equipment and the wafers are transported 
into the film-fabrication module in a controlled atmosphere for 
deposition of the designed film. It has been reported that 
batch-type clustered equipment using fluoride vapor etching for 
post-processing can fabricate high-quality capacitance film with 
a thickness of around 40 angstroms.[.sup]5[/] 
  Figure 3 shows the process flow when capacitance nitride 
film 
is fabricated by performing several processes continuously in 
the same module.[.sup]6[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-14A>           Figure 3. Flow of Continuous Multiple Processing in a </FIG>




  Figure 4 shows the result of oxygen analysis in the 
capacitance film and interface in the depth direction (SIMS). 
The figure shows that a natural-oxide film layer is observed at 
the interface between nitride film and silicon in the case where 
a nitride film is fabricated by stand-alone equipment. Further, 
the use of continuous, multiple processing using hydrogen baking 
in pre-processing allows complete removal of the natural-oxide 
film. This has reduced the leakage current of nitride 
film-stacked capacitors, and produced a remarkable improvement 
in long-term reliability (Figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-14B>           Figure 4. Oxygen Profile on Nitride Film/Silicon Interface </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-15A>           Figure 5. Long-Term Reliability of Nitride Film-Stacked </FIG>




  As described above, continuous, multiple processing in 
cluster tools or in a single module is a very effective method 
for fabricating high-quality capacitance film, and an 
improvement in throughput can also be expected from continuous 
processing within the same equipment. Further, development of 
mass-production equipment is desirable as soon as possible. 
Moreover, since the quality of CVD film varies depending on the 
purity of the process gas, it is also important to develop gas 
purification technology along with the equipment improvements. 
  LP-CVD technology using organic source gas for the 
deposition 
of tantalum-oxide film as a highly dielectric film to replace 
capacitance-insulation nitride film is being developed for 256M 
DRAMs. The importance of reducing natural-oxide film on the 
electrode surface of tantalum-oxide film is similar to the 
nitride film described above.[.sup]7[/] With 
SrTiO[.sup]3[/] and PZT, which are expected to be used as 
highly dielectric materials, techniques for film fabrication 
such as the sol-gel, sputtering, and CVD methods are being 
studied. Expectations are that development of manufacturing 
methods and equipment suitable for mass production will be 
available in the near future. 
<H5>  2. Silicon Film Fabrication Equipment </H5>
  It is expected that the applications of in-situ doped 
silicon 
films in devices will expand greatly in the mass-production 
stage of 256M DRAMs. This expectation is based on the following 
points: Since decreasing the temperature is a must in the 256M 
DRAM manufacturing process, the previous technology for thermal 
diffusion of impurities is of limited use. In addition, it is 
difficult for current technology to deal with contact poly-Si 
embedding with a large aspect ratio, and the fabrication of 
high-quality thin doped silicon film which are required by the 
progress of integration. In-situ doped silicon film fabrication 
is promising technology for solving this problem but there are 
still many technological problems to be overcome for the 
present. The most important problem is to develop a film with 
excellent coating which can be used for three-dimensional 
cylinder capacitor electrodes and microfine contacts. The 
problem of increased resistance in doped silicon film when 
fabricating it as thin film has also been pointed 
out.[.sup]8[/] Furthermore, since the control of 
natural-oxide film at the interface is necessary when embedding 
a contact in the same way as when fabricating a capacitance 
film, cluster tools or multiple processes in the same chamber 
will also be required. 
  Recently, fabrication of a special silicon film containing 
hemispherical grains on the surface (HSG-Si: hemispherical 
grained Si) has been studied.[.sup]9[/] The HSG-Si film has 
about twice the surface area of ordinary silicon film and is 
expected to be applied in capacitor electrodes. Figure 6 [photo 
not reproduced] shows an example of the use of HSG-Si as an 
electrode. 
  To form these hemispherical grains, a clean surface should 
be 
maintained so that silicon atoms can migrate freely on the 
amorphous silicon-film surface. If a natural-oxide film layer is 
formed on the amorphous silicon-film surface, the migration of 
silicon atoms would be reduced and HSG-Si would not be formed. 
Therefore, equipment with low-oxygen partial pressure is also 
required to prevent natural-oxide film in HSG-Si fabrication. 
<H5>  Oxidation Technology </H5>
  It is theorized that 256M DRAMs may use gate-oxide films 
with 
a thickness of around 80 angstroms. Film thickness at this level 
is already being developed for use in the gate-oxide films of 
CMOS and the practical level has already been reached. However, 
it is still undoubtedly important to advance the improvement of 
gate-oxide film quality in the future. Consequently, the 
following discussion deals with the oxidation technology 
required to promote film quality improvement. 
  At present, reduction of the interface level, development of 
oxide film containing nitrogen, reduction of particles, and 
reduction of metal contamination are being attempted to improve 
oxide film quality. For these technical subjects, it is 
necessary to study them from the process side, including 
cleaning, as well as from the equipment side. 
  Problems related to the atmosphere when wafers are input to 
the oxidation furnace have been dealt with often in recent 
years. Figure 7 shows the difference in oxide-film reliabilities 
when the oxygen concentration in the nitrogen gas in the furnace 
is varied.[.sup]10[/] As shown in the figure, the oxide-film 
quality and reliability vary extensively depending on the oxygen 
concentration in the furnace. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-16A>           Figure 7. In-Furnace Atmospheric Dependence of Gate-Oxide </FIG>




  On the other hand, it has also been reported that, if a 
wafer 
with its Si surface exposed experiences a temperature rise or 
furnace input operation in high-purity nitrogen gas or inert 
gas, the irregularities on the silicon surface increase and 
cause deterioration of the electric properties.[.sup]11[/] 
Such a problem will not occur if a thin-oxide film is formed by 
irradiating the silicon surface with UV-O[.sup]3[/] before 
the wafer is input to the furnace.[.sup]11[/] This indicates 
that the thin-oxide film protects the surface layer. 
  As described above, the electrical properties of oxide film 
are largely variable depending on furnace input conditions. If 
core tube-type equipment is used in the mass production of 256M 
DRAMs, it would be advantageous to solve the problems in furnace 
input without making the equipment more complicated. 
  It is highly probable that RTP equipment will be applied in 
the fabrication of gate-oxide film. This is because its cold 
wall-type structure is expected to be capable of solving the 
above problems and that problems in throughput may not occur 
thanks to the gate-oxide film becoming thinner. RTP may also be 
effective for use in nitrogen-oxide film fabrication because the 
process gas and temperature can be switched instantaneously. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In the above, the process technologies required for 
oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD equipment in the 256M DRAM 
generation, and the problems in the equipment have been 
described. The process technologies for this generation feature 
the following five points: 1) interface and surface control; 2) 
continuous processing; 3) lower temperatures; 4) cleaning 
technology; and 5) complete control of process parameters. To 
improve the accuracy of such process technologies, it is 
important to improve control technology based on the 
understanding of natural phenomena in the manufacturing 
equipment. Presently, improvement of process accuracy is being 
attempted by clustering the manufacturing equipment, as this can 
remove unstable factors originating from outside the equipment. 
Clustering of equipment is also expected to improve the 
throughput due to the omission of processes such as cleaning. 
Conversely, a major source of worry in clustering is a possible 
increase in equipment failures due to increased complexity. The 
need here is evident: simplify or standardize the equipment. 
  In this generation, the selection between batch equipment 
using core tubes and wafer-level equipment using lamps may be 
important. Selection according to the processes used may be 
required. Regardless of the selection, all types of equipment 
are required to provide low price and high throughput, 
compatibility with large diameter wafers, and highly accurate 
control of the atmosphere inside each module.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The higher integration and increased capacity of DRAMs 
recently progressed at the astonishing rate of four times every 
three years, but the trend has gradually changed in the past two 
to three years. This is because of the diversification of market 
needs and because extensions of current technologies are 
incapable of dealing with new technological developments in 
terms of both technology and cost. In particular, while 
multi-layer wiring technology is needed for the development of 
memory and logic devices by making the basic processes common, 
insufficient progress has been made in new technology 
integrating the micro-wiring/micro-connection holes of memory 
devices and the increased number of wiring layers/increased chip 
area of logic devices. 
  In this report the author would like to introduce his ideas 
on inter-layer insulation film fabrication technology in the 
256M generation and user needs for such equipment from the 
viewpoint of a process engineer. 
<H5>  Themes for Inter-Layer Insulation Film Fabrication Technology </H5>
  Flatness requirements of insulation film between wiring 
layers can be classified into the filling of high-aspect ratio 
wiring spaces and overcoming wiring height differences as shown 
in Figure 1. The former requires the plugging of microfine 
spaces with an aspect ratio of more than 1.0 and the latter 
requires a global flatness which does not cause any 
interdependence between wiring width and wiring pattern density. 
In fact, these issues have been dealt with by realistic 
solutions at a practical level. Nevertheless, as the level of 
requirements for these technical solutions has been increasing 
in importance since the generation of 64M DRAMs, these 
technological requirements cannot be dealt with by present 
technology, otherwise the number of process steps would greatly 
increase along with factors causing the yield to drop. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-17A>           Figure 1. Themes for Inter-Layer Film Flattening </FIG>




  Table 1 shows the items posing problems if presently used 
technology for flattening inter-layer films is to be applied in 
the 256M DRAM generation.

                                      it difficult to assure inflow domain in 
                                      SOG coating 

                                      Insufficient resolution of wiring height 
                                      differences due to denseness/coarseness 
                                      of wiring patterns (Figure 2)

                                      only for specific wiring spaces 

                                      Wiring height differences cannot be 
                                      overcome (Restrictions in design rule 
                                      such as space width increases) 

                                      Combination with other processes is 
                                      required, causing complication of 
                                      processes 

Sputter-etching combined technology   (1) Plugging characteristics deteriorate 
                                      following the reduction of wiring space

                                      be increased

                                      difference can be reduced (45Î) but the 
                                      altitude difference cannot be overcome 

                                      Combination with other processes is 
                                      required, causing complication of 
                                      processes 


  The flattening technology used most widely at present is the 
technology combining SOG-coated film with etch-back, which 
provides a flatness with a practically permissible level. The 
biggest problem in this technology or its combination with other 
existing technologies with regard to microminiaturization is, as 
shown in Figure 2, overcoming wiring height difference due to 
the density and coarseness of wiring patterns. This technology 
basically consists of the fabrication of SiO(1) film used as the 
base of the SOG coating, coating of SOG, etch-back, and the 
fabrication of SiO(2) film. However, as microminiaturization 
decreases the wiring space, the SiO(1) film plugs the wiring 
spaces. Consequently SOG inflow domains cannot be secured and, 
in positions where patterns are laid out with high density, the 
SOG film is deposited thickly above the wiring pattern. This 
causes insufficient resolution of the wiring height difference 
due to the density and coarseness of the pattern. To allow this 
technology to be extended to the 256M generation, new 
technologies should be developed for the fabrication of SiO(1) 
film and other SOG-related matters.

  In addition to the use of SOG, flattening technology using 
ozone-TEOS and that combining sputter-etching are also widely in 
practice. With the former technology, the film cannot be thick 
due to its insufficient reliability so the method for 
fabrication on a plasma-TEOS film with excellent film quality is 
generally used. As a result, while wiring spaces with specific 
widths can be flattened by plugging when the film fabrication 
amount is optimum, the flattening capability is lost with wider 
wiring spaces. To compensate for this inherent problem of 
flattening using ozone-TEOS, attempts are being made to use 
multi-step combinations with other processes or to impose a 
major restriction on the wiring space in pattern design. With 
the flattening technology combining sputter-etching, when SiO 
film fabrication and sputter-etching are repeated alternately, 
space plugging will be incomplete as shown in Figure 3 [photo 
not reproduced] and the effective film thickness will vary 
depending on the wiring space. Figure 3 shows a case using three 
alternate repetitions. Increasing the repetition count allows 
widening the process margin, but the result would be impossible 
to use in mass production. In addition, sputter-etching causes 
dust generation problems and tends to degrade the components 
inside the chamber, so it is difficult to improve its stability 
as production technology. Furthermore, this technology is only 
capable of reducing the inclination angle between sections with 
different heights and cannot solve the altitude difference 
itself, so that multi-step combination with other processes is 
indispensable to solve the wiring height difference. 
<H5>  Flattening Technology in the Age of 256M DRAMs </H5>
  Technological developments aiming at plugging of microfine 
wiring spaces and overcoming the wiring height difference that 
are required for the 256M generation can be classified into two 
subjects as shown in Table 2.

  The first is technological developments based on flattening 
technology using SOG coating. As described above, application 
limit of this technology is largely dependent on the SiO(1) 
film-fabrication technology and SOG-related technology. As shown 
in Figure 4, by developing: SiO(1) film-fabrication technology 
which can deposit on peaks to ensure the SOG inflow domains in 
the microfine wiring spaces while maintaining the film quality 
(such as resistance to moisture and cracks even on the side 
walls of wiring patterns); and developing an SOG material which 
does not need etch-back and which can be coated thickly; and 
developing an SOG coating technology with improved surface 
mobility to allow migration from dense pattern areas to coarse 
pattern areas and so on; the process margin of SOG flattening 
technology can be improved sufficiently and this technology can 
be applied continuously in the 256M generation. The second 
subject is the practical implementation of new technology such 
as ECR-CVD and CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). ECR-CVD is 
film-fabrication technology in which SiO film deposition and 
sputter-etching based on ion impact take place simultaneously. 
Since the phenomenon as shown in Figure 3 hardly occurs in 
practice, much is expected of this technology in its capability 
of plugging high-aspect ratio spaces by itself. Figure 5 [photos 
not reproduced] shows cross-sectional SEM micrographs of an 
example of the application of ECR-CVD. As ECR-CVD leaves 
projections on the wiring patterns, additional processing to 
remove them is required. The technical problems with ECR-CVD 
technology include damage, wafer temperature control, foreign 
matter countermeasures and productivity, as well as the basic 
properties of the film. CMP technology is attracting strong 
attention as a new flattening technology but its practical 
implementation presupposes inter-layer insulation-film 
fabrication technology which can plug microfine wiring spaces. 
The development issues of CMP include uniformity, polishing, 
control, influence of density differences on the pattern, 
removal of contamination and foreign matter and the equipment 
installation environment. Its potential as production technology 
with high process accuracy is being studied also, taking the 
thickness variations of the silicon wafer itself (around 20 
Êm) and warp with actual wafers (around 100 Êm) into 
consideration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-20A>           Figure 4. Suitable SiO(1) Film Deposition Shape for SOG </FIG>




  As described above, two promising flattening technologies 
for 
the 256M generation are technologies based on SOG, and ECR-CVD 
and CMP. However, these two technologies may be used by 
selecting one according to the level of the individual 
flattening requirement. On the other hand, new technologies are 
being developed which can plug microfine spaces and overcome 
wiring height differences simultaneously in a single 
process.[.sup]1,2[/] What the process engineers are really 
seeking is such a single-process breakthrough, and it will take 
such to achieve an effective simplification. 
<H3>  Perspective of Inter-Layer Insulation Film Fabrication 
Equipment </H3>
  As described in the above, flattening technology in the 256M 
generation is following the sequence of searching for a 
breakthrough technology while maintaining a development strategy 
based on existing technology, and covers a wide range of 
technologies including plasma CVD, coating, ECR-CVD, polishing 
and others. Therefore, depending on what kind of process is 
selected, the equipment used will vary and hardware requirements 
will also differ. Basically, equipment which can assure 
reproducibility and stability for the resolution of the 
processes described above is urgently required. 
  From the aspect of production technology, the processing 
capability, including the operating ratio and dust prevention 
measures, will be more important than ever. The operating ratio 
should be considered as a reduction of the time during which 
wafer processing is impossible, rather than a reduction of 
failure time. That is, maintenance and inspection time, 
including the exhaust/harm removal systems, should be counted in 
the time wafer processing is impossible. 
  Dust prevention measures will be based on previously 
acquired 
technology such as dust-free robot arms and frictionless valves, 
and foreign matter reduction measures should not be dependent on 
existing knowledge or process, but be dealt with from an aspect 
of hardware such as the component materials or equipment 
concept. In this context, self-cleaning of the process chamber, 
which has recently been put to general use should be treated as 
an important process technology. Self-cleaning itself is an 
important plasma process and a design cognizant of in-plane 
uniformity, end-point judgment technology, and matching with 
other components inside the chamber will be required more than 
ever in the age of 256M DRAMs. 
  As for recent trends in general production facilities, while 
advances in equipment are being promoted through the development 
of automated equipment, wafer-level handling, cluster tools and 
intelligent equipment incorporating process monitoring and data 
communications functions, the requirements for cost reduction 
and energy saving are also growing rapidly. Certainly, 
inter-layer film flattening technology presupposing a multi-step 
process combining plasma-TEOS film, ozone-TEOS film, 
sputter-etching etc., automation, wafer-level processing, 
clustering and the use of artificial intelligence for achieving 
process accuracy, will be necessary. But these will result in a 
drastic increase in equipment cost and virtually ignore process 
simplification. What is required in the age of 256M DRAMs is not 
an apparent simplification such as the clustering of complicated 
processes, but completely new technology to simplify the 
processes. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In recent years, the development of LSIs and reduction of 
production costs have become critical requirements determining 
the survival of the semiconductor industry, and the 
technological requirements for flattening of multi-layer wiring 
are also getting more and more severe. In this situation, both 
equipment manufacturers and device manufacturers fully recognize 
that processes based on a combination of existing technologies 
cannot address the industry of the future. 
  Therefore, improvements of present technologies can deal 
with 
problems from the 16M generation to the beginning of the 64M 
generation but, when the 256M generation is considered, both 
equipment and device manufacturers will have to stress the 
simplification of technologies themselves or the implementation 
of new technologies that allow simplification, rather than the 
pursuit of apparent simplifications by clustering or automation 
of multi-step processes. Conceiving new approaches to 256M 
production is expected to give a new vitality to inter-layer 
insulation fabrication technology in the age of 256M DRAMs.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Device design, process, and equipment development have 
started for 256M DRAMs, the mass production of which is expected 
to start in the year 2000. With 256M DRAMs, which are expected 
to require &yen;100 billion to &yen;200 billion for R&amp;D and a 
few times more for mass production, the point is how to make it 
possible to produce efficiently while minimizing plant and 
manufacturing equipment investments.[.sup]1[/] In general, 
this is being attempted by using the same manufacturing 
equipment to produce several generations of devices and refining 
existing process technology. However, with regard to 
quarter-micron devices, limits in manufacturing technology and 
processes have already been seen, particularly with multi-layer 
wiring. 
  This report describes the present status of metal CVD 
technology for multi-layer wiring and the necessary equipment 
configuration for it.

  As device microminiaturization advances, migration breakages 
of Al wiring will be significant. Meanwhile, CVD-single-crystal 
Al recently developed is attracting attention for its resistance 
to wire breakages.[.sup]2[/] High melting point metals such 
as W and Cu are expected to be used as wiring materials to 
replace Al because these metal atoms hardly cause migration. The 
problems studied for blanket W wiring include increased 
throughput, particle reduction, stress reduction, and decrease 
of resistance. Since the current density increases as the wiring 
becomes finer, the generation of Joule heat cannot be 
disregarded, with W having a higher resistance than Al. It was 
recently found that W with a resistance of about 7 microhm-cm 
can be formed into film-by-film fabrication using 
diborane.[.sup]3[/] On the other hand, it is essential to use 
bond layers to prevent the separation of blanket W and, due to 
the physical limit of TiN coverage by sputtering, the CVD of TiN 
is being studied in this context. CVD-TiN with high coverage and 
low temperature can be used in Al multi-layer wiring and is 
expected to be used as plugging technology replacing W. Film 
fabrication utilizing hydrazine reduction[.sup]4[/] was also 
developed recently. It is expected that composite wiring 
technology of CVD-TiN and CVD-W will be used in next-generation 
processes. With wiring formation by CVD-Cu,[.sup]5,6[/] 
problems include the method of supplying a stable liquid source, 
etching, Cu oxidation and so on. 
  Contact holes and via holes can be plugged with blanket W or 
selective W, which are being studied from the viewpoints of 
process and cost. Since selective W makes positive use of 
chemical differences on the surface, a cleaning process is used 
before film fabrication to remove natural-oxide film. Selective 
W should guarantee selectivity for a variety of inter-layer 
films. Plugging with blanket W, at least three processes, TiN, 
blanket W, and etch-back, are necessary so stacked wiring should 
be advanced, resulting in a cost disadvantage in the age of 256M 
DRAMs where productivity is especially important. Therefore, the 
simplest and most effective method may be to use selective W for 
plugging, and form multi-layer wiring by sputtered Al. 
<H5>  Clustering of Equipment </H5>
  To improve the reliability of multi-layer wiring for 256M 
DRAMs to a similar or better level than existing devices, 
plugging and wiring using CVD films with excellent coverage or 
stacked wiring combining CVD film and sputtered film may be 
necessary. To fabricate low-resistance contacts, interface 
control is important to remove natural-oxide film and 
contamination on the contact surface and form a clean surface 
with good reproducibility. Particularly, attention should be 
paid to residual oxygen or moisture when fabricating Al or Cu 
films. From these viewpoints, studies are being conducted into 
the combination of sputtering and CVD and into clustered 
equipment consisting of several sputtering chambers or CVD 
chambers.[.sup]7[/] 
  Figure 1 [photos not reproduced] shows the effects of 
post-processing and continuous processing in selective W film 
fabrication.[.sup]8[/] Films can be formed on wafers which 
have been transported in vacuum after dry pre-processing, but 
cannot with conventional wet pre-processing using 
HF/H[.sup]2[/]O. Therefore, selective W must be combined with 
dry pre-processing, which can be achieved with clustered 
equipment. Figure 2 shows the contact resistance when sputtered 
TiN and Al are formed into films continuously in vacuum or 
discontinuously (with a period of standing in atmosphere) after 
W film fabrication.[.sup]9[/] Contact resistance in the case 
of in-vacuum continuous-film formation is lower than that of 
standing in the atmosphere between processes. This is because 
the W surface is oxidized in the atmosphere in the case of 
discontinuous film formation, and shows the effectiveness of 
in-vacuum continuous processing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-21A>           Figure 2. Annealing Temperature Dependence of Contact </FIG>




  Figure 3 shows typical examples of multi-layer wiring 
processes, those for contact hole plugging and for via hole 
plugging.[.sup]10[/] To use the reflow of sputtered Al for 
plugging, a three-chamber configuration is required including 
the base TiN and annealing chambers. Plugging with selective W 
is based on a two-chamber configuration including a 
pre-processing chamber. Plugging with blanket W requires four or 
five chambers from pre-processing until etch-back so the scale 
of clustered equipment becomes large. The etch-back process is 
not necessary when blanket W is used directly for wiring. As 
seen above, there are several available process combinations, 
and it is important for the fabrication of multi-layer wiring to 
select low-cost processes which emphasize productivity. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-22A>           Figure 3. Examples of Multi-Layer Wiring Fabrication </FIG>




  On the other hand, the implementation of clustered equipment 
is an approach for minimizing so-called process dead time by 
increasing throughput by means of several identical chambers as 
well as composite processes, the number of chambers based on the 
processing time of each process. This makes the use of modular 
chambers important. Figure 4 shows typical examples of the 
layout of the chambers of clustered equipment.[.sup]11[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-22B>           Figure 4. Examples of Chamber Configuration of Clustered </FIG>




<H5>  Advantages of Clustered Equipment, Future Topics </H5>
  Table 2 shows the advantages of metal CVD, or generally 
speaking, the clustering of wiring equipment, and future topics. 
The biggest advantages include the maintenance of the fabricated 
film surface with high reproducibility, the prevention of 
contamination, and the reduction of processing time. 



  Table 2. Advantages of Equipment Clustering, Future Topics 

Advantages                            Topics 

Maintenance of deposited surface      Prevention of cross-contamination 
with high reproducibility through     between sputtering and CVD 
vacuum transportation 

Prevention of foreign matter          General reliability of equipment 
adsorption or contamination through 
continuous processing 

Reduction of processing time          Soft reliability of composite process 
required for several processes 

Reduction of footprint in clean       Development of several processes as a 
room                                  total process 

Possibility of combining desired      Reduction of cost 
process chambers with a high degree 
of freedom 

                                      Increase of throughput 


  It is said that more than 80 percent of the defects with 64M 
to 256M DRAMs are attributed to particles or metal contamination 
on the wafer. Particles and contamination are produced in the 
film-fabrication chambers or during wafer transportation and are 
influenced by the cleanness of the manufacturing line. In the 
future, because the environment of the manufacturing line will 
be "super-clean," particles and contamination will mainly be due 
to the equipment. It is estimated from the above that more than 
90 percent of the drops in yield of 256M DRAM-class products 
would be due to particles and contamination.[.sup]12[/] In 
consequence, therefore, the problems in the clustering of 
equipment will include how to reduce dust production in 
individual film fabrication chambers and the transportation 
system. Particularly, with blanket W, if bonded layers are 
fabricated from sputtered TiN, W film separation from the 
periphery may occur depending on the TiN film state and the W 
above the susceptor will tend to be the source of particles. 
This will be dealt with by the use of uniform TiN film or a 
method for prevention of W film formation around the wafer by 
adjusting the mechanical clamp of the wafer or the gas flow. 
Cleaning equipment is also being studied. On the other hand, 
with the combination of the Al sputtering and CVD chambers, the 
trend is the use of ultrahigh vacuum. Optimization of the 
transportation pressure is necessary from the viewpoints of 
cross-contamination and particles. In this way, the clustering 
of equipment allows a combination of processes but requires high 
system reliability and excellent maintainability. This is 
because the increase of equipment size inherently degrades 
reliability and, should the equipment fail, the wafer process 
itself would be impossible. Therefore, the equipment's 
reliability and operation ratio will be important bases for 
judging equipment usable with 256M DRAMs. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Increase in the scale of device integration has made plant 
investment so huge that profitability has become questionable. 
As a result, 256M DRAMs require rather simplified processes to 
reduce production costs. Technology combining plugging with 
selective W and sputtered Al is considered suitable for 
economical multi-layer wiring fabrication, along with a high 
manufacturing equipment operation ratio. On the other hand, 
wafer size increase, process composition and film stability 
requirements make wafer-level reaction chambers the most 
practical and clustered equipment is suitable to use them. While 
the selection of processes which are realistic from the 
viewpoints of device and cost is necessary to implement the 
above, how clustered equipment should be developed has not been 
established at present because there are still various proposals 
on the chamber configuration to be used. Therefore, to implement 
multi-layer wiring for 256M DRAMs at low cost, the equipment 
should be implemented based on specific data to prevent 
over-specification, while presupposing the use of 
high-reliability wiring. To achieve this end, the integration of 
process development and equipment development will become more 
and more important.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Semiconductor devices are steadily increasing in scale, and 
256M DRAM quarter-micron rule devices are currently being 
developed. Microminiaturization and the increased scale of 
integration necessary to deal with this are gradually increasing 
the importance of wiring technology. This is because the wiring 
process has become the process determining the yield and 
reliability of devices. The recent trend is that the wiring 
structure itself is complex, in addition to microminiaturization 
and the attendant increase in the number of layers of wiring. 
This is apparent specifically with plugging technology for 
filling fine contact holes and the stacking with high melting 
point materials to assure the reliability of Al wiring. 
  Sputtering has played an important role in the fabrication 
of 
Al wiring. Although CVD is gradually penetrating the domain of 
metal film fabrication, sputtering technology may remain 
necessary as long as Al wiring is used because Al is a very 
active material and sputtering is beneficial for obtaining good 
film quality from such a material. Since sputtering equipment 
supplanted deposition equipment in metal film fabrication, it 
has experienced various technical innovations including 
wafer-level processing and the use of multiple chambers. After 
composite processing with CVD or annealing has almost reached a 
practical level, almost all of the present sputtering equipment 
is being made with cluster tools. 
  This report describes the configuration and functions of the 
sputtering equipment required for manufacturing 256M DRAM-class 
devices, but in this changing environment it is difficult to 
present the total picture. The report first describes the 
dissatisfaction of users concerning existing sputtering 
equipment, then considers some of the functions required for 
future sputtering equipment. 
<H5>  Problems in Equipment Configuration </H5>
  First, let us consider the equipment configuration. To 
assure 
uniformity in film thickness, sputtering needs a target with 1.5 
to 2 times the diameter of the wafer. For example, as shown in 
Figure 1, a target with a diameter of 300 to 360mm is used with 
an 8-inch diameter wafer. This necessitates a larger process 
chamber than CVD equipment. Following the use of multiple 
chambers and wafer size increase, the equipment now has a very 
large footprint, making it almost impossible to install adjacent 
to other process equipment. Apparently, equipment manufacturers 
are unaware of this problem. Users need equipment with a body 
depth of less than two meters. It is also desirable to reduce 
the size of auxiliary equipment such as the power supply unit, 
or to stack it to reduce its footprint. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-24A>           Figure 1. Positioning of Sputtering Target for 8-Inch </FIG>




  Since layered wiring started to be fabricated using 
multi-chamber equipment, throughput has halved compared to 
conventional film fabrication using Al alone. What is worse, the 
complexity of multi-layer wiring and layered wiring has 
increased the number of sputtering processes. This drives the 
urgent need for multi-chamber sputtering equipment with high 
throughput. To increase throughput, it may also be necessary to 
review the semi-independent chamber system using plate transfer, 
without continuing the use of arm transport systems. 
<H5>  Problems in Basic Functions </H5>
  Next, consider some of the basic functions of the equipment. 
Up to the present, the performance of process equipment has 
often been evaluated under simplified conditions that differ 
from actual operating conditions. The simplified conditions do 
not emulate controlling the actual device manufacturing process. 
This evaluation method for controlling or monitoring the status 
of actual film fabrication itself needs evaluation. 
  Particle reduction is the most important topic in sputtering 
equipment for the 256M DRAM generation. While clean-room 
technology is advancing, the reduction of other factors causing 
particles in manufacturing equipment is not sufficient. 
Especially, following the microminiaturization and multiple 
layers of Al wiring, particles from the sputtering equipment 
have become the main factor degrading yield. In general, 
particles attached to wafers have been evaluated by simply 
examining the transport operation. However, since it was found 
that particles are also produced during film fabrication, 
evaluation covering the film fabrication process has become 
essential. Measuring particles had been difficult because metal 
films have high reflectivity and large surface coarseness but, 
as shown in Figure 2, measurement is possible even when metal 
films are used. Of course, equipment which can guarantee a low 
particle count even with film is desirable. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-25A>           Figure 2. Examples of Measurements of Particles With Metal </FIG>




  Major sources of particles in sputtering equipment are the 
wafer transportation system and the targets and anti-deposition 
plate in the process chamber. With regard to the wafer 
transportation system, it has been proposed to apply vertical or 
face-down transportation, but the correct method to reduce 
particles may be to simplify the wafer transportation system 
rather than to rely on wafer orientation. With regard to 
particles from the target, they can be reduced greatly by using 
full-face eroded cathodes.[.sup]1[/] Dust from the 
anti-deposition plate or clamping mechanism is also a source of 
worry. In-situ cleaning is used in practice with CVD equipment 
but practical use of in-situ cleaning with sputtering is deemed 
difficult. Problems include attaching of the film over a wide 
area of the anti-deposition plate and the adverse influence of 
reactive gas on the fabricated film quality. Improving the 
bonding force by plasma conditioning or reducing thermal stress 
by maintaining the anti-deposition plate heating temperature 
have been proposed, but a more essential improvement is 
desirable. Figure 3 shows the results of composition analysis of 
particles detected after film fabrication with Ti and TiON. SUS 
and SiO[.sup]2[/] particles are derived from the transport 
system and Al and TiON particles are believed to be produced in 
the process chambers, though the specific positions cannot be 
identified. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-25B>           Figure 3. Example of Result of Particle Analysis of </FIG>




  With wafer heating, much sputtering equipment is now capable 
of heating the stage up to 600ÎC, and temperature 
distribution is also being improved. The technology can be 
considered to have reached the practical level when application 
in high-temperature sputtering, which plugs contact holes by 
flowing Al, is taken into account.[.sup]2[/] However, while 
the temperature during film fabrication and its distribution are 
most important, they are not controlled completely for the 
present because of the difficulty in temperature measurement 
during film fabrication. It is desirable to monitor the 
temperature during film fabrication, control it within 10ÎC 
from the target temperature, and control the temperature 
distribution over the wafer within 10ÎC. Gas heating by 
flowing gas between the wafer back-side and stage is 
advantageous for preventing an excessive temperature rise during 
film fabrication. To improve temperature uniformity it may be 
necessary to divide the stage into several areas and apply 
independent temperature control to each. 
  With the degree of vacuum, a base pressure of the order of 
10[.sup]-9[/] Torr is now available in mass-production 
machines thanks to their ultrahigh vacuum capability. An 
ultrahigh vacuum is necessary for fabricating high-reliability 
Al wiring with a large grain diameter and good orientation, and 
to stabilize the process of high-temperature sputtering. 
Nevertheless, with substrate heating of around 500ÎC 
required for high-temperature sputtering, for example, a vacuum 
of the order of 10[.sup]-9[/] Torr has not been achieved due 
to increased degassing from the chamber. It is desirable that 
equipment achieve a base pressure of the order of 
10[.sup]-9[/] Torr, even used for heated film fabrication at 
600ÎC. However low the base pressure, it is still 
meaningless if there is any degassing from the target and its 
surroundings. Figure 4 shows that the peak of H[.sup]2[/] 
rises when Al film fabrication is started. This is because 
moisture is emitted from the target surroundings; this reacts 
with Al and H[.sup]2[/] is left as a result. Such degassing 
should also be reduced. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-26A>           Figure 4. Analysis of Gases in Al Film Fabrication (with </FIG>




  Additionally, film fabrication rate monitoring, which has 
been possible with batch-type systems, is not possible when a 
wafer-level method is used. Considering the increasing necessity 
of fabricating thin films such as reflection prevention film 
with high controllability, the revival of this function is 
desirable. 
<H5>  Desirable New Functions </H5>
  The following describes the new functions desirable for 
sputtering equipment. 
  The first desirable function is the improvement of coverage. 
In the age of 256M DRAMs, contact holes will have diameters of 
0.3 Êm and the aspect ratio will be around 3. In such a case, 
ordinary sputtering may be able to achieve only a small 
percentage of coverage, which is insufficient even for bonded 
layers of blanket tungsten. Coverage can be improved by 
increasing the vertically incident component. A solution for 
this is collimated sputtering, but this method is difficult to 
use due to collimator blocking and particle production problems. 
Another possible method is to reduce the scattering of sputtered 
particles by decreasing sputtering gas pressure. As ECR 
sputtering[.sup]3[/] has been proposed as a specific method, 
the announcement of a practical machine is awaited. It is also 
effective to decrease oblique incident components from the 
target surroundings by decreasing the target diameter or by 
increasing the distance between the target and wafer. But, this 
is a trade-off with the film thickness distribution in the wafer. 
  Another attractive new function is combining with CVD or 
annealing. It is estimated that microminiaturization of the 
contact holes would lead to the necessity of continuous 
processing to avoid oxidation due to atmospheric exposure in 
order to secure the ohmic contact. Specific merits of this 
method have already been reported[.sup]4[/] but further study 
may be required on the inevitability of using it on a 
manufacturing line. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, sputtering is 
increasing in importance as a process determining yield and 
reliability. However, existing sputtering equipment in which the 
use of cluster tools is advanced poses problems in terms of 
footprint and throughput. Since particles will be a more 
important problem following a microminiaturization, reducing 
them will be the most important topic in the device 
manufacturing of 256M generation DRAMs. The advantages of 
composite processes which are attracting attention require 
further study.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The development of advanced devices at the 256M DRAM level 
requires technology for the fabrication of patterns of 0.25 
Êm 
or below (with an accuracy of +/- 0.05 Êm). For pilot 
fabrication, it will be necessary to provide stable microfine 
pattern fabrication technology (equipment, processes, etc.) in a 
few months. At the present stage in which photoexposure (i-ray, 
KrF, + resolution improvement) technology which is fully usable 
below 0.25 Êm has not been established yet, electron beam 
(EB) 
direct-drawing technology, which is capable of drawing microfine 
patterns and is not restricted by chip size, is considered the 
only lithography technology which can provide stable processing 
in this domain. Usually, the following are considered the major 
issues of the EB direct-drawing technology. 
  (1) EB equipment technology: Analysis and improvement of 
drawing accuracy, improvement of throughput, and stabilization 
of operation. 
  (2) Resist process technology: Selection of resist, 
optimization of process conditions, and countermeasures against 
charge-up. 
  (3) Pattern data processing technology: Technology for 
conversion of massive data, correction of proximity effect. 
  These are universal technological issues that have been 
tackled for more than a decade; technologies have been developed 
and optimized for each generation and applied in prototyping 
advanced devices. 
  Recently, we developed and optimized these technologies and 
applied the results to prototype a 256M DRAM.[.sup]1[/] In 
this report, we will introduce 0.25 Êm EB direct-drawing 
technology, detailing the analysis and improvement of drawing 
accuracy with regard to drawing equipment, optimization of 
process conditions with resist processing technology, and 
correction of the proximity effect by pattern data processing 
technology. 
<H3>  EB Equipment Technology -- Analysis and Improvement of 
Drawing Accuracy </H3>
  To secure the drawing accuracy required for 0.25 Êm 
processes, analysis and evaluation of the accuracy of each part 
of the equipment is necessary along with the study of accuracy 
improvement based on the results of the analysis. 
Variable-shaping EB equipment[.sup]2[/] used for our 
prototyping provided the drawing accuracy analysis results shown 
in Table 1, where the improvement of mark detection accuracy 
with the largest error is essential.

  The EB equipment uses symmetrical correlation computation 
applying a correlation operation,[.sup]3,4[/] and features 
the capability of highly accurate detection even with low S/N 
signals and low dependence on the shape of marks. But the 
detection accuracy is largely variable depending on the value of 
correlation operation parameter W (correlation operation width). 
Therefore, to minimize variations in detection accuracy, we 
developed a technique for optimizing operation parameter W. 
  Figure 1 shows the W optimization technique that we 
developed.[.sup]5[/] First, to improve the S/N of input 
signal Y(i) (the primary differential signal in mark detection), 
autocorrelation processing is performed and output correlation 
signal Z'(i) is obtained. Then, from the signal peak width of 
Z'(i) with improved S/N, optimum correlation operation parameter 
W is obtained from the following formula: 
  W = W[.sup]0[/] + _D_W 
  Here, _D_W is the beam width when a mark is detected. The 
use 
of this technique can improve the mark detection accuracy from 
0.046 Êm (3 _s_) to 0.020 Êm (3 _s_). In addition, 
overall 
drawing accuracy was improved by improving the stage-moving 
accuracy. These improvements have made it possible to reduce the 
calculated overall drawing accuracy below 0.070 Ê (3 _s_), 
assuring the drawing accuracy necessary for use of the 0.25 
Êm rule.

  Figure 2 shows the alignment accuracy in the actual 
prototyping of a 256M DRAM. It refers to the accuracy of the 
word-line layer with respect to the device-separation layer. The 
accuracy is good on both the X and Y axes, sufficiently within 
the alignment margin required from the device structure. Similar 
alignment accuracy results were also obtained with other layers 
by previously optimizing the correlation operation parameter for 
each EB drawing layer, within 0.075 Êm (3 _s_) which is 
almost the identical level to the calculated accuracy.

<H3>  Resist Process Technology -- Optimization of Process 
Conditions </H3>
  With EB direct drawing, electrons lose energy when they are 
scattered in the resist, and this energy forms a negative or 
positive image by causing chemical reactions among the resist 
molecules. Therefore, electron scattering in the resist is the 
most important factor governing the shape of the resist. Because 
the prototype EB equipment used an accelerating voltage of 20 
kV, the resist film thickness should be decreased to reduce the 
influence of forward scattering. However, thin resists cannot 
cover the height differences in the device and are not 
sufficient for use as the mask in etching. Actual prototyping 
was based on a multi-layer resist process. A single-layer resist 
process was also used in some instances for reducing the TAT. 
  When a multi-layer resist process is used, it is essential 
to 
optimize the thickness of the organic film in the lower layer. 
Previously, the lower-layer organic film had a large thickness 
(1 to 2 Êm) to reduce the influence of backscattering from 
the 
wafer. However, when drawing patterns at the 0.25 Êm level of 
the 256M DRAM class, the aspect ratio rises during organic film 
etching, causing a size shift, pattern tilting, and shape 
deterioration. In short, the minimum required thickness of 
organic film is determined by the absorption of height 
differences, resistance to etching, and influence of 
backscattering. 
  We first studied the thickness of the lower-layer organic 
film and the influence of backscattering by simulating energy 
accumulation.[.sup]6,7[/] As shown in Figure 3, the thickness 
of the lower-layer organic film hardly influences the contrast 
of the distribution of the electron accumulation amount (at the 
interface with SOG film). This result shows that the thickness 
of the lower-layer organic film can be optimized by considering 
only the thickness of the etched material and the height 
difference on the wafer in every EB drawing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-28B>           Figure 3. Interface Contrast of Accumulated Energy (at </FIG>




  Figure 4 [photo not reproduced] shows the bit-line patterns 
of SAL601 negative-resist prototype with a multi-layer resist 
process. 
  The single-layer resist process can be applied in 
prototyping 
in the case where the height difference on the wafer is small, 
the pattern is coarse, and the selectivity ratio between the 
etched film and resist is sufficient. As the single-layer resist 
process allows the TAT and etching count to be reduced, it makes 
it possible to minimize size variations. 
  In actual prototyping, the single-layer resist process was 
applied with bit-line and capacitance contacts. As shown in 
Figure 5 [photos not reproduced], contacts were fabricated with 
reasonable accuracy in both (a) the cell-array section and (b) 
the peripheral-circuit section. This is assumed to be possible 
by a small mutual proximity effect attributable to the 
relatively coarse drawing pattern and by the wide exposure 
margin of the ZEP520 positive resist used. 
<H3>  Pattern Data Processing Technology -- Correction of 
Proximity Effect </H3>
  For the fabrication of microfine patterns of the 0.25 Êm 
class using EB direct-drawing technology, it is essential to 
correct the proximity effect which degrades the drawing 
accuracy. Therefore, when we converted the design data into data 
formatted for the EB equipment, we developed a data conversion 
system which can correct the proximity effect at the same time 
as the two-level data compression processing. 
  This correction processing is based on the two-dimensional 
self-consistent method using the EID (energy intensity 
distribution) function,[.sup]8[/] and also uses contour 
processing and rectangle redivision processing. Also, we 
specially developed a vector processing system using an SX-2 
supercomputer and a simplified one-dimensional drawing intensity 
calculation technique to decrease conversion time (CPU time). 
  Figure 6 shows the basic concept of the one-dimensional 
processing technique. In case identical patterns are developed 
infinitely (beyond the backscattering domain) in the direction 
of an axis (Y axis), the mutual proximity effect (drawing 
intensity) in the axial direction can be considered constant. 
Therefore, because the intensity drawing on the pattern to be 
corrected (required when correcting the proximity effect) can be 
determined by a primary line integral calculation considering 
only the drawing intensity in the X-axis direction, the drawing 
intensity calculation time can be reduced. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-28C>           Figure 6. Simplified Technique for One-Dimensional </FIG>




  By optimizing the weight of the drawing intensity, the 
processing at the corner sections of the array-developed region 
becomes possible in the same way as at the array center section 
and a satisfactory pattern can be obtained as shown in Figure 7. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-29A>           Figure 7. Before and After One-Dimensional Proximity </FIG>




  Figure 8 shows the conversion time when the above is applied 
to the word-line layer. The conversion time when vector 
processing and one-directional proximity effect correction are 
applied is drastically reduced to about 1/20 of the conversion 
time with two-dimensional processing without vector processing. 
Also, as a result of applying the one-dimensional proximity 
effect correction to other layers of the prototyped 256M DRAM, 
we could reduce the conversion time to a practical period of 30 
to 50 minutes, and the proximity effect would be corrected 
satisfactorily.

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We applied EB direct-drawing technology using variable-shape 
electron-beam drawing equipment (accelerating voltage 20 kV, 
current density 10 A/cm[.sup]2[/]) to the prototyping of a 
256M DRAM using the 0.25 Êm rule. Actual prototyping was 
hybrid with i-ray technology and EB direct-drawing technology 
used for layers with the 0.25 Êm rule. 
  Aiming at stable operation of EB equipment and the 
improvement of its alignment accuracy, we analyzed the accuracy 
factors of the prototype, developed a technique for optimization 
of the correlation parameters (EB equipment technology), 
optimized the multi-layer resist process (partially single-layer 
resist process) (resist process technology) and developed the 
two-level data compression technology for large-capacity data 
and one-dimensional proximity effect correction technology 
(pattern data processing technology). 
  As a result, we were able to produce the prototype 256M DRAM 
shown in Figure 9 [photo not reproduced], with an alignment 
accuracy of no more than 0.075 Êm (3 _s_).

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO) has 
developed the world's first single crystal thin film for 
application in semiconductors using a carbon material, 
``fullerene (C60).'' Fullerene has been getting much attention 
recently as a new electronic material. A lcm x lcm single 
crystal thin film was produced by depositing ionized molecules 
on a substrate. The new thin film has high heat and radiation 
resistances and can be made into large scale integrated 
circuits, thus enabling development of a new semiconductor 
substrate. Si and GaAs semiconductors have been available up to 
now. MELCO expects the new single crystal thin film to be useful 
for more complex material research on fullerene which is still 
unknown in many respects. 
  Mica (potashmica) at 200ÎC was used as the substrate 
material to develop a fullerene single crystal thin film. 
Fullerene molecules were deposited on this substrate by the 
ionized cluster beam (ICB) method. The ICB method calls for 
ionization of clusters such as molecules and atoms first, then 
accelerating the ion movement by applying voltage, and finally 
depositing the ionized clusters onto the substrate. Using this 
method, fullerene molecules can be uniformly aligned. Proper 
control of ionization and acceleration conditions made 
production of a large single crystal thin film possible, and 
this is the key to practical application for semiconductor 
materials. 
  It was confirmed through transmission electron microscope 
(TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) that 15 nanometer thick 
single crystal thin film was formed on the entire mica 
substrate, lcm x lcm. It was also confirmed that fullerene 
molecules employed epitxial crystal growth, which is the 
formation process in which the film molecules are uniformly 
lined up according to the crystal orientation of the substrate. 
  At present, the molecular beam deposition method is used 
mainly to form fullerene molecule film. However, this method is 
useful only for polycrystal thin film formation. Formation of 
single crystal thin films has been reported, but the size is 
limited to a little over 100 nanometer each side at a maximum. 
  MELCO confirmed for the first time in 1992 that fullerene 
molecules can be used for semiconductor materials. Their Central 
Research Laboratory and Materials and Electronic Devices 
Laboratory have been jointly conducting research on commercially 
viable size single crystal thin film. MELCO will try to develop 
a transistor device using this single crystal thin film in the 
future. MELCO claims that this new single crystal thin film will 
be useful for more complex material research on fullerene. 
Polycrystal thin films turned out to be not as useful for this 
purpose. 
<H5>  Wide Application Potential--Useful for Optical Material </H5>
  (Commentary) The history of research on fullerene is quite 
short. Up to now, research has been focused mainly on the search 
for new types of fullerene and basic properties. The newly 
achieved result not only contributes to proper measurement of 
fullerene molecule properties but also shows how they might be 
used in semiconductors. The research on new carbon materials has 
gone beyond the basic science stage and made progress in 
materials development which consciously aims at applications. 
  ``Carbon nano tubes,'' ultra fine straw-like substances, 
have 
also been found. This is also a new kind of carbon material, 
which belongs to the same group as the fullerene molecules. The 
fullerene molecules are shaped like a hollow soccer ball, while 
carbon nano tubes are characterized by a tube-like shape with 
layers of carbon atom thin skins. R&amp;D on the new carbon 
materials is still at the primary stage, but the application 
potential is already considered to be extremely high. In 
addition to semiconductor materials, optical materials, high 
performance catalysts, and micro machines are under 
consideration to name just a few. Because of their unique 
shapes, the new carbon materials are a big challenge for 
researchers.

  [Text] The Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) 
has developed a technology to mass-produce the high-purity `C60' 
carbon molecule at low cost. The technology calls for separation 
and purification by filling the inside of a doughnut-shape 
molecular structured aromatic organic compound ring with C60 
molecules. Ninety-nine point 8 percent high-purity C60 can be 
produced at 1/20 the cost of the conventional method. Since low 
cost mass-production of the C60 is possible, application efforts 
for semiconductors and catalysts are expected to accelerate. 
Research will be further conducted to facilitate 
commercialization as early as possible. 
  The new technology was developed by the Shinkai 
Chemirecognics Project (Director, Professor Seiji Shinkai of 
Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu University) team of the 
Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology Operation Project, 
JRDC. Prof. Shinkai and his team discovered the precipitated 
substance in a solution while conducting research on compounds 
(``karikkusu)/arene'' derived from a circle of 8 benzene rings 
which are useful as solvent for the C60. Observation by nuclear 
magnetic resonance device of the precipitated substance showed 
the C60 being placed completely inside the compound ring. 
  In order to obtain high purity C60, first low purity C60 
containing soot was dissolved in toluene. Then karikkusu/arene 
was added. Soon C60 entered the inside of the ring and a light 
green substance precipitated. The precipitated substance was 
taken out and dissolved by chloroform. 
  The chloroform pushed the C60 out of the ring. The C60 which 
was pushed out of the ring precipitated into a black substance, 
which completes the separation. The purification experiment 
achieved 99.8% high purity C60 at a yield rate of 
approximately 
70% by using about 60% low purity C60 as a starter.

  [Text] Daisan Kasei Co., Ltd. (Daisan Kasei), a maker of 
fatty acids and photosensitive materials, has developed a 
special coating material to be used for insulative and sealing 
films. The material is a poly-para-xylene-based resin that can 
be formed by the CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method into 
films thinner than epoxy resin films. European and the U.S. 
makers have already developed similar resins, which have been 
drawing attention in connection with the development of highly 
integrated printed circuit boards. However, Daisan Kasei's resin 
is said to have higher purity and better electrical 
characteristics than those resins. 
  Daisan Kasei has begun to sell the new resin under the trade 
name of ``diX.'' The resin diX consists of 
dichloro-para-cyclophane made from para-methyl benzyl trimethyl 
ammonium chlorite by chlorination and dimerization; para-methyl 
benzyl trimethyl ammonium chlorite is made from para-methyl 
benzyl chlorite, a herbicide raw material. 
  Dichloro-para-cyclophane-based coating materials made by 
European and U.S. makers are made by chlorinating 
para-cyclophane. In this case, the purity of 
dichloro-para-cyclophane does not approach 100 percent very 
closely because chlorine sometimes is not bonded 
stoichiometrically. In the production method developed by Daisan 
Kasei, the chlorination proceeds nearly stoichiometrically to 
yield dichloro-para-cyclophane with a purity of 99 percent, 
approximately 10 percent better than the products made by others. 
  Due to its high purity, the new resin has excellent 
insulating capability, heat resistance, and resistance to 
discoloration. Daisan Kasei has already filed applications for a 
patent in six countries, including Japan, the United States, and 
Europe. In addition, the material has already been confirmed to 
be in conformity with the U.S. military specifications. 
  Daisan Kasei has completed a 3-ton-per-year production 
facility in its Goi Plant (Ichihara City, Chiba Prefecture) with 
an investment of approximately &yen;100 million. The resin is 
priced at approximately &yen;200,000 per kg, which is comparable 
to similar products already on the market. In the next several 
years, Daisan Kasei plans to achieve an annual sale of 
&yen;400-500 million with the new resin and the CVD device. 
  Daisan Kasei is a company capitalized jointly, 50-50, by 
Chisso Corp. and Kishimoto Sangyo Co., Ltd.

  [Text] Sumitomo Light Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo 
Light Metal), has successfully confirmed a new synthesis method 
for titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds. The method 
comprises the blending process of titanium and aluminum powders, 
the extrusion-molding process, and the reaction process in a 
heated reactor. By developing this method, Sumitomo Light Metal 
eliminated the problems of coping with difficult machining after 
molding the intermetallic compounds and their tendency to 
oxidize at as high a temperature as 800ÎC. Initially, 
Sumitomo Light Metal has begun distributing samples of 
automotive engine valves to major automobile makers. The 
lightweight intermetallic compounds will reduce the valve 
weights, and in turn, improve engine output and reduce fuel 
consumption. Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds, which 
are promising as lightweight, heat-resistant alloys for 
automotive components, can be applied more broadly for aircraft 
and electric power generation turbines if their machinability is 
improved. 
  The method developed by Sumitomo Light Metal was the 
``reaction-sintering method'' for titanium-aluminum 
intermetallic compounds. In the method, titanium and aluminum 
powders are mixed and melted with agitation after the component 
ratio and heat input have been adjusted, and the molten mixture 
is extrusion-molded into a final shape. Subsequently, in a 
heated reactor in which the high pressure of 2,000 atm is 
maintained, titanium and aluminum in the mixture are made to 
react under pressure to form an alloy. 
  Titanium-aluminum-based intermetallic compounds have been 
drawing attention for their lightweight and high-temperature 
strength. However, the compounds have been extremely difficult 
to machine after the compound is formed by the reaction of 
titanium with aluminum. Moreover, both titanium and aluminum are 
easily oxidized at a high temperature, and oxidized alloys tend 
to undergo deformation. 
  Thus, Sumitomo Light Metal added chlorine to the titanium 
during the production process to form a film to improve 
resistance against oxidation. Currently, the company is 
developing a mass-production technology based on the reaction 
sintering method under a consignment from the Japan Research 
Development Corp. of the Science and Technology Agency. 
  Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds have specific 
gravities of 3.8 to 3.9, as compared with 2.7 for aluminum and 
7.8 for iron. The tensile strength per unit area for the 
compounds at normal temperature is 50-70 kg, which is slightly 
lower than 60-100 kg for heat-resistant steel and nickel-based 
alloys. However, at high temperatures, the compounds do not lose 
as much strength as do the other metals, so that the compounds 
are stronger than the other materials at approximately 
800ÎC. Sumitomo Light Metal plans to market the compounds 
with their advantage as lightweight, heat-resistant materials 
that can withstand high-speed rotation at high temperatures. The 
initial target will be automotive engine valves that replace 
existing valves of heat-resistant steel and nickel-based alloys. 
The applications for the compounds are expected to broaden if 
the production cost, including machining cost, can be reduced.

  [Text] Using new technologies, including the multi-layer 
film coating technology and the ``X-coating'' technology for 
removing residual tensile stresses that generate cracks in the 
film, Toshiba Tungaloy Co., Ltd. (Toshiba Tungaloy), has 
developed the most advanced material coating technology to 
dramatically improve the wear and defect resistance of cutting 
tool edges by forming a functionally gradient structure. 
  Toshiba Tungaloy used the new technology for commercial 
production of the ``X''-series coated cutting tools for steel 
machining, and the products were received well by users. 
  Thus, Toshiba Tungaloy plans to place more emphasis on 
marketing new products made by the new technology, while 
expanding the range of products for which the new technology can 
be applied. The new technology is a combination of three 
material technologies: the formation of 12 layers of dense 
coating film, the formation of a balanced matrix, and the 
``X-coating'' technology. By using the new combination 
technology, Toshiba Tungaloy was able to improve the defect 
resistance 2- to 10-fold and the wear resistance 1.5- to 2-fold 
over those of existing high-toughness coating materials. 
Heretofore, Toshiba Tungaloy has commercialized and placed in 
the market sturdy and durable ``T700X Series'' coating materials 
-- T715X and T725X -- one after the other. Due to the extremely 
favorable responses by users, Toshiba Tungaloy is trying to 
expedite the expansion of sales of these two products, while 
developing new applications of the technology to other product 
series. 
  The twelve layers formed by the film coating technology 
consist of 10 chemical-vapor-deposition layers based on titanium 
carbide (TiC), titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium carbo-nitride 
(TiCN), and an alumina-based (Al[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) 
layer and a titanium nitride-based layer on top of the 10 CVD 
layers. The total thickness of the coating layer is 10 to 12 
Ê. Through the formation of multi-layers, a dense, functional 
gradient structure with fine crystalline grains is constructed 
for the purpose of improving the layer's wear resistance. 
  The X-coating technology is used to greatly improve the 
defect resistance of this coating layer. Because the coating 
layer's thermal expansion coefficient is larger than that of the 
matrix, a tensile residual stress will be generated in the 
coating layer upon cooling. The stress tends to promote the 
propagation of cracks when loads are applied in intermittent 
cutting. The X-coating technology can solve this problem. When 
the X-coating technology is used, microfine cracks are 
intentionally created in the coating layer by a special method, 
so that the tensile residual stress will be reduced. At the same 
time, the special method increases a compression residual stress 
at the surface of the matrix, so crack propagation will be 
suppressed and the defect resistance will be dramatically 
improved. 
  This technology was commercialized by Toshiba Tungaloy after 
it acquired the license for the technology, which had been 
developed jointly with Nippon Steel Corp., Nittetsu Choko Co., 
Ltd., and Toho Kinzoku Co., Ltd. and for which a patent 
application had been filed jointly. Toshiba Tungaloy combined 
the licensed technology with its technology developed in-house. 
  The third component of the new technology involves the 
adoption of a method for controlling the propagation of cracks 
toward the inside of the matrix by creating a layer for removing 
the _b_ phase on the matrix's surface and the use of a 
super-hard matrix material with well-balanced defect and wear 
resistance. 
  Toshiba Tungaloy was successful in combining the above three 
technologies to create the functional gradient mechanism in the 
entire cutting edge, and is now capable of supplying the 
products that can guarantee longer life and more reliability for 
cutting tools that users have needed most in their effort to 
reduce the labor for the metal cutting process or to automate 
that process.

  [Text] Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe Steel), has successfully 
developed a high-strength, low-alloy steel powder 
``Planetalloy'' (trade name). The new alloy steel powder, found 
to have the world's strongest tensile strength, was produced by 
blending other alloy components to iron powder and sintering the 
mixture. Although an increasing number of sintered components 
has been used in automobiles, there is a limit to the amount of 
additive components for existing sintered materials, not to 
mention the fact that these materials require heat treatment. In 
response to user demand, Kobe Steel developed the powder and 
began test marketing with sintered compact makers. Today, Kobe 
Steel is evaluating verification test results and soon plans to 
start full-scale market development. 
  Planetalloy developed by Kobe Steel is low-alloy steel 
powder 
with an average particle size of 10 Ê, and it contains 3.4 
percent nickel, 0.4 percent molybdenum, 0.9 percent manganese, 
0.9 percent chrome and 0.4 percent silicon, in addition to its 
iron powder base. When this powder is added at a rate of four to 
five percent to pure iron powder whose particle sizes range from 
45 to 250 Ê with an average of 100 Ê, the mixture is 
sintered to obtain the sintered compact with the world's 
strongest tensile strength of 150 kg/mm[.sup]2[/]. 
  The automotive industry is now using approximately 65,000 
tons per year of iron powder, primarily in sintered compact 
components, and the recent trend of the use of sintered 
components employing high-strength, low-alloy steel powder has 
been on the rise. However, the existing low-alloy steel powder 
tends to react with the atmospheric gas during the sintering 
process to alter the composition. Thus, there have been 
restrictions as to what and how much can be added. In addition, 
the entire process of producing high-strength steel powder 
needed to be improved by adding a heat treatment process after 
the sintering process. 
  On the other hand, it has been confirmed that Planetalloy, 
which has been micronized to a 10-micron size by a water 
atomizer, has its alloy components diffused throughout the 
micro-structure during the sintering process, and the formation 
of bainite and martensite acts to reinforce the interstices of 
iron powder to greatly improve tensile and mechanical strengths. 
It is also possible to produce sintered compacts with various 
characteristics of choice by changing the composition through 
the adjustment of pre-alloying quantities of micropowders and 
the carbon amount. Kobe Steel already has developed free-cutting 
steel powder. 
  Kobe Steel has set up a production facility at the PM Center 
within its Takasago Plant and has begun to ship samples to 
sintered compact makers to have them evaluate product 
performances. As soon as the results of the evaluation are in, 
Kobe Steel plans to embark on full-scale commercialization.

  [Text] Assistant Professor Kenichi Kondo and Assistant 
Hisako Hirai at the Material Research Institute of the Tokyo 
Institute of Technology have successfully synthesized a 
high-purity, amorphous diamond from the soccer-ball-like 
molecule (C60) consisting of 60 carbon atoms. The research group 
produced the high-speed collision of a bullet with the carbon 
molecules to create an ultra-high pressure and ultra-high 
temperature state. Although the research project is only at its 
initial stage, the synthesized material is sufficiently pure to 
be used for electronic materials. Thus, the method appears to be 
promising as a new synthesis method for artificial diamonds. 
  For the synthesis, the group fired an approximately 
2-cm-diameter, 2-cm-long bullet toward a tungsten vessel 
containing C60 micropowder. The collision impact momentarily 
created a state of ultra-high pressure and ultra-high 
temperature, and diamonds were synthesized. 
  Moreover, the group tried to rapidly cool the system after 
the synthesis to prevent deformation due to residual heat. Thus, 
highly heat-releasing gold was used to sandwich C60 inside the 
reaction vessel in order to be able to cool the product at a 
rate of 10 billion degrees per second. 
  In the experiment, the group sandwiched 0.01 g of C60 
particles with diameters ranging from 20 to 30 Ê (1 Ê is 
1/1,000-th mm) between two 0.2mm-thick gold sheets, and this was 
placed in the vessel. A metal-tipped polyethylene bullet was 
made to strike that vessel, and a state of 500,000 atm and 
2,000ÎC was created. In a time span of 0.3 Êsec, C60 was 
converted into a 10-Ê-thick film. Under an optical 
microscope, 
the film was found to consist of approximately 90 percent 
colorless, transparent material and 10 percent intact, black C60. 
  The size of the colorless, transparent material was 0.1mm at 
maximum. When studied with X-ray, carbon atoms were connected by 
the diamond bonding, although the overall structure consisted of 
amorphous diamonds with a distorted, special structure. The 
transparent material was harder than sapphire. Assistant 
Professor Kondo conjectures: ``It is likely that C60 was 
compressed under the ultra-high pressure to become diamonds.'' 
  Previously, amorphous diamonds had an amorphous structure 
because of hydrogen contained in the crystalline structure. The 
newly synthesized material did not contain any hydrogen, but had 
carbon atoms arranged densely and uniformly. Thus, it is said to 
be sufficiently pure to be used for electronic and optical 
materials.

  [Text] The actual status of materials R&amp;D in Russia was 
disclosed in a report compiled by the Russian Materials R&amp;D 
Survey Mission (Leader: Professor Hidemi Koinuma, Tokyo 
Institute of Technology) sent by the Science and Technology 
Agency. The Mission visited 14 materials research organizations, 
including the Angarsk Electrolysis-Chemical Complex, a research 
institute in Siberia. This mission recently compiled its survey 
report based on the observation of ``materials research 
activities in various shapes and forms, many of which may be 
considered competitive with counterparts in Japan and the U.S.'' 
  According to that report, Russia's Atomic Energy Department, 
in cooperation with Phillips Corp., is pursuing a TV-tube 
production project with a production goal of 3 million pieces 
per year. An NPO (Ratti) (in a Moscow suburb) is studying 
high-temperature gas furnaces, carbon-coated fuels, and the 
nuclear reactor Topaz for space uses; is developing 
photomagnetic disks with a technology level equivalent to that 
of Sony Corp.; and is carrying out research with a single 
crystal growth device via the Czochralski method, one of the 
pull-up methods. 
  At the 40-year-old Chemical Technology Research Institute, 
the report says, rare metals that have been made three to four 
times more efficient by the coprecipitation method are being 
applied to piezo-ceramics, and 300- to 500-kg lots of samarium 
are being produced in a large crucible by using large-current 
electromagnetic induction.

  [Text] In its 4 October 1993 announcement, Maeda Tubes Co., 
Ltd. (Maeda Tubes), a secondary concrete product manufacturer, 
disclosed its development of ultra-high-strength concrete with a 
bending strength comparable to that of aluminum. 
  Maeda Tubes was able to develop the high strength by filling 
the space between cement particles with a mixture of a 
thermosetting resin and a special additive. Professor Teruo 
Kishi of the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology 
at the University of Tokyo, who was present when the 
announcement was made, said the following: ``This performance 
makes the material applicable to aircraft structural 
materials.'' Maeda Tubes plans to market the new product to a 
broad field of industries. 
  The trade name of this new product is ``Maeta Power Ceramics 
(MPC).'' The product was developed in cooperation with Professor 
Masaki Hasegawa (Polymer Chemistry) of Toin Gakuen Yokohama 
University. Ordinary concrete has a structure in which cement 
grains are bonded with each other through the formation of 
hydrates as a result of the reaction between cement and water. 
Such concrete has many gaps between grains, resulting in low 
bending and tensile strengths because the strength of the 
bonding material itself, i.e., the hydrate, is poor. 
  In contrast, MPC can be hardened by heating a molded, 
clay-like mixture of cement, a resin and an additive, without 
any water, for several hours at approximately 200xC. A small 
amount of water from the resin forms an extremely thin hydrate 
film on the surface of cement grains, and the film and the resin 
that fills the space between grains react to produce a bonding 
material with high strength. 
  According to Maeda Tubes experiments, MPC showed a bending 
strength of 1,200-2,200 kgf/cm[.sup]2[/], as compared with 70 
kgf for ordinary concrete and approximately 1,500 kgf for 
metallic aluminum. As for the tensile strength, MPC registered 
540-1,000 kgf, in contrast to 470-1,200 kgf for aluminum. 
  The density of MPC is approximately 2.2 g/cc, which is lower 
than aluminum. In addition, MPC is fire-resistant, 
corrosion-resistant, and readily machinable. In the future, 
Maeda Tubes plans to distribute samples to machine and transport 
manufacturers and construction companies to seek new 
applications. MPC sheets with a thickness of 2-3mm are expected 
to be priced at &yen;10,000-15,000 per square meter.

  [Text] Dowa Mining Co., Ltd. (Dowa Mining), has 
successfully developed magnesium that is 99.9999 percent (6N or 
six-nine) pure. Previously the highest purity confirmed with 
magnesium had been 99.99 percent (4N). Thus, Dowa Mining was 
able to reduce the amount of impurities to 1/100th of the 
previously purest metal. Dowa Mining achieved the feat by 
ingeniously modifying its own metal purification method and by 
developing the necessary purification facility by itself. 
Knowing that high-purity magnesium can help improve the 
performance of the blue semiconductor laser that is under 
development by electric machine makers, Dowa Mining plans to 
broadly distribute samples of the new metal. 
  As one can surmise from the fact that magnesium has been 
used 
for photographic flash, magnesium is highly reactive with air. 
Thus, it is more difficult to produce highly pure magnesium than 
to produce other high-purity metals. That is the reason 
4N-purity magnesium had previously been the purest possible. 
  Dowa Mining first designed its own purification facility 
with 
a new material to minimize the opportunity for magnesium to 
react with air, and it optimized temperature conditions for 
magnesium purification. Furthermore, Dowa Mining made use of 
previously known metal purification technologies, such as zone 
melting, chlorides, distillation and electrolysis, as well as 
added the production technology for gallium arsenide, a compound 
semiconductor, and developed the new purification method to 
achieve the 6N purity for magnesium. 
  High-purity magnesium is used with zinc and selenium in the 
clad layer of the blue semiconductor laser. The blue 
semiconductor laser has been in the limelight as a 
next-generation product that major electric machine makers have 
been trying to develop. Today, the laser is not yet completely 
developed, as it can emit light only at a low temperature, and 
intermittently. 
  The new, 6N magnesium is expected to improve the performance 
of the semiconductor laser. In addition, the high-purity metal 
provides the additional advantage of permitting laser developers 
to concentrate only on design improvement without worrying about 
any flaws in the material. 
  Dowa Mining intends to sell samples of this purest magnesium 
at &yen;30,000 per gram, and the aggressive sales activities 
will be coordinated with the sales of 6N-pure zinc and selenium.

  [Text] Toshiba Tungaloy Co., Ltd. (Toshiba Tungaloy), 
jointly with Cho-Onpa Kogyo K.K. (Cho-Onpa Kogyo), has developed 
an instrument for measuring ``high-temperature total dynamic 
elastic moduli and vertical and horizontal internal wear,'' 
which is expected to become a powerful, supportive tool for 
R&amp;D 
concerning new materials including structural ceramics. 
  This epoch-making ultrasonic device is capable of 
simultaneously measuring nine material dynamic parameters, 
including various elastic constants and internal friction, over 
a temperature range of from room temperature through 
1,550ÎC. With this device, it is now possible to easily and 
simultaneously determine elastic moduli and internal friction 
unique to a given material, which had previously been difficult 
to measure. Thus, materials design should be made easier than 
before, and useful information can be obtained for clarifying 
material behavior. Toshiba Tungaloy is scheduled to present a 
paper on this development at the sixth Fall Symposium of the 
Japan Ceramics Association, which will start on 6 October 1993. 
  The Toshiba Tungaloy group developed a compact, ultrasonic 
device capable of dealing with small samples. With this device, 
the group succeeded in simultaneous determination of nine 
parameters for structural ceramics, such as _a_-alumina, 
_b_-alumina and cubic zirconia polycrystal [(Y)TZP], from room 
temperature through 1,550ÎC in an argon atmosphere. These 
parameters were seven, elastic modulus-related parameters 
(Young's modulus, shear modulus, volume modulus, 
compressibility, Lame parameter, Poisson ratio and acoustic 
velocity anisotropic constant) and two parameters of vertical 
and horizontal internal frictions. The group found that, for 
_a_-alumina, Young's, shear and volume moduli decreased, while 
Poisson ratio increased parabolically, as temperature increased. 
From these results and with a decrease in the acoustic velocity 
anisotropic constant, the group obtained data for _a_-alumina 
that hinted the activation of shear mode at high temperatures. 
  The group also obtained data clearly indicating behavior of 
(Y)TZP from the super-plastic phenomenon and the grain boundary 
sliding-involving phenomenon, while pursuing parameter changes 
with increasing temperature. The elastic moduli of a solid, like 
its dielectric constant, are the fundamental properties unique 
to the material, and they are extremely important for evaluating 
the material and designing with the material. Today, not many 
data on various elastic moduli have been published, and no 
high-temperature data are available since it has been impossible 
to determine parameters at a high temperature and to 
simultaneously determine elastic moduli in horizontal and 
vertical directions. It has been known that the internal wear 
can be widely used for studying glass transition, lattice flaws, 
residual stress, structural state and grain boundary dispersion, 
and can be useful in determining correlation with various 
physical properties over an entire temperature range of 
measurements. However, no discrimination has been made for 
various physical phenomena occurring within a material due to 
vertical (elongation) wear and horizontal (shear) wear. No 
simultaneous measurement of these parameters to 1,550ÎC has 
been made either. 
  The development of this new measurement device is expected 
to 
significantly spur materials R&amp;D. Toshiba Tungaloy plans to 
aggressively sell the device to universities and major 
manufacturers at a price of &yen;30 million for the device 
capable of measuring to 1,550ÎC and &yen;20 million for the 
one capable of measuring to 800ÎC.

  [Text] Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe Steel), has successfully 
developed the technology for forming thin diamond films with a 
high degree of orientation on a silicon single crystal. The 
achievement was made by the joint group representing Kobe 
Steel's Kobe General Technical Research Institute and its U.S. 
research institute, Electronic Material Research Center (North 
Carolina). The group used the microwave plasma CVD (chemical 
vapor deposition) method to form highly oriented, extremely 
smooth, thin films of diamonds. Thin diamond films have drawn 
worldwide attention because of their potential as 
next-generation substrate material, although it has been 
difficult to produce highly oriented, flat, thin films. The 
development by Kobe Steel is expected to spur development and 
implementation of diamond semiconductor devices. 
  The diamond thin-film formation technology developed by Kobe 
Steel was the result of the application of the microwave plasma 
CVD method. The technology involves the epitaxial growth of an 
SiC layer on a silicon single-crystal wafer and the bias growth 
of a diamond nucleus before the deposition of a diamond thin 
film. Previously, such a film had been grown hetero-epitaxially 
on cubic boron nitride (cBN). However, Kobe Steel's technology 
is unique in that it epitaxially forms an SiC film on a silicon 
wafer. The group was able to obtain an extremely high degree of 
crystalline orientation by depositing a diamond thin film on a 
bias nucleus. 
  Because of their excellent hardness, optical transparency, 
thermal conductivity, and electrical insulating capability, 
diamond thin films are expected to become the next-generation 
substrates in place of the current silicon single crystal 
substrates. Thus, development of electronic devices using 
diamond substrates has been actively pursued. The only problems 
with the development have been the crystalline orientation and 
smoothness of the diamond thin film. 
  Kobe Steel, the world leader in the field of diamond thin 
film, has established a three-base research system within itself 
to carry out R&amp;D concerning diamond thin films: the bases 
have 
been the Kobe General Technical Research Institute, in charge of 
thin film formation; the U.S. Electronic Material Research 
Institute, in charge of thin film evaluation; and the U.K. 
research institute, in charge of the analysis of thin-film 
characteristics. The latest achievement, which resulted from the 
R&amp;D system, is expected to accelerate diamond 
semiconductor-device development.

  [Text] The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL) of the 
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology have neared the 
establishment of ultra-precision machining technology with 
excimer laser for ceramic surfaces. MEL developed the new laser 
method for softening ceramic surfaces and combined this method 
with a machining technology with a diamond needle to perform 
cutting with the depth precision of a micron. In the previous 
chemical treatment, a ceramic sample was immersed in a liquid 
that tended to unnecessarily soften the entire surface. In 
contrast, with the new technology, only a desired part of the 
surface is softened and cut. This technology is expected to 
widen the application range of ceramics into the advanced 
material field including x-ray mirrors. 
  According to Hiroko Hibi, the research engineer at MEL who 
was carrying out the research, the ceramics used were silicon 
nitride and silicon carbide. The laser was a krypton fluoride 
excimer laser with a frequency of 249 nm (1 nm is 
1/1,000,000,000th of 1 m). Each of the hollow, disk-shaped 
samples of silicon nitride and silicon carbide, approximately 4 
cm in diameter and approximately 8-mm thick (the diameter of the 
hollow interior being approximately 1.5 cm), was irradiated by a 
laser at each of three different energy levels; i.e., 
frequencies of 5, 10 and 20 Hz, and the ceramic surface was 
softened. At the same time, the sample was rotated and its 
surface was cut for 20 minutes with a diamond needle whose tip 
had a radius of curvature of 0.1 to 0.15mm. As a result, with 
the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz, a groove with a width of 
slightly less than 0.2mm and a depth of approximately 7 Ê was 
made on the surface of the silicon nitride disk, and a groove 
with a width slightly more than 0.2mm and a depth of 40 Ê was 
made on the surface of the silicon carbide disk. The cutting 
width and depth are said to be controllable by adjusting the 
needle size and the cutting time. In contrast, the lasers with 
frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz cut grooves 5-10 Ê deep on the 
silicon nitride disks and 10-20 Ê deep on the silicon carbide 
disks, but the groove widths were as wide as 1mm, which was too 
wide. Thus, the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz was considered to 
be the most suitable for machining. At the higher frequencies, 
surplus laser energy tended to soften the surface more than 
necessary, apparently resulting in excessive cutting. Without 
the aid of the laser, it was practically impossible to machine 
these ceramic disks. The hardness of a 100-percent silicon 
nitride ceramic piece was 17 gigapascal (giga is million, and 
pascal is a pressure unit); whereas its hardness was reduced to 
1.2-1.9 gigapascal after laser irradiation. 
  Laser irradiation causes silicon nitride and silicon carbide 
to change into softer silicon dioxide and silicon. The energy 
for this softening change is estimated to be at least 0.005 
J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon nitride and at least 0.012 
J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon carbide.

in search of methods for producing totally new materials. On 7 
October 1993, the first meeting was held, with attendees 
representing various research institutes under the jurisdiction 
of AIST and administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. At this 
meeting, university researchers gave lectures on liquid 
crystalline molecular building blocks and the science of 
super-molecules, which were followed by discussion. With an eye 
to ferreting out futuristic research ideas and seeking project 
topics, the Forum plans to hold roughly four meetings by the 
spring of 1994. 
  AIST says its previous projects concerning material 
development primarily pursued improvement of performances and 
functions of existing materials, i.e., they were not meant to 
develop new materials in a true sense. Therefore, AIST 
established the New Material Research Forum for the purpose of 
discovering technical seeds that will eventually lead to the 
creation of new materials, such as nylon, which began the 
historical material revolution. 
  The Forum is organized with members from MITI and related 
institutions, although the policy is to maintain a flexible 
membership structure, since research targets could be 
wide-ranging; i.e., the best qualified researcher for a given 
topic will be asked to join the Forum, regardless of affiliation. 
  The first meeting was attended by 11 researchers from the 
National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) and 
the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, in addition to 
administrative personnel from MITI and AIST. Assistant Professor 
Takashi Kato of the Production Technology Research Institute of 
Tokyo University and Assistant Professor Akihiko Ueno of the 
Tokyo Institute of Technology lectured on ``liquid crystalline 
molecular building blocks'' and ``the science of 
super-molecules,'' respectively, and research activities and 
trends under these topics were discussed after the lectures.

  [Text] The Japan Gas Association and four major city gas 
companies, including Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. -- in cooperation with 
Isuzu Ceramics Research Institute (Yokohama City; President: 
Takeshi Inao); Noritake Co., Ltd.; and Nippon Shokubai Kagaku 
Kogyo Co., Ltd. -- will begin the development of a ceramic 
natural-gas engine for power generation. The development project 
will run for five years, and its outlay is expected to be 
approximately &yen;5 billion, one half of which will be 
subsidized by the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy. 
  Ceramic engines can generate high energy efficiencies by 
eliminating the need for cooling water, because the cylinders 
are made of high-heat-resistant ceramics. The projected 
power-generation efficiency, which indicates the degree of 
conversion of fuel into power, is 46 percent, which clearly 
exceeds 30 to 38 percent for earlier gas engines. If a ceramic 
gas engine is used for a co-generation (heat- and 
electricity-supplying) system, the overall energy efficiency is 
expected to be increased to 86 percent. 
  The ceramic gas engine, when developed, will be first 
promoted for uses in offices, hotels and hospitals. The office 
use will be particularly promoted because there its power 
generation efficiency is much higher than the co-generation 
system it replaces.

  [Text] Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal), 
has developed a boride-dispersed, titanium-based composite alloy 
with improvements of more than 30 percent over the previous 
values in both rigidity and fatigue strength. Sumitomo Metal was 
able to eradicate the weaknesses of titanium alloys, i.e., poor 
wear resistance and low rigidity, by adding approximately one 
percent boron. The new alloys can be mass-produced on the same 
vacuum-arc-resolution (VAR) method-based production line as 
before, and they can be sold at approximately the same price as 
that for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy, the most common 
titanium alloy. Sumitomo Metal has already begun sample shipment 
to some aircraft manufacturers. The company plans to continue 
application development for the new alloy with the emphasis on 
automotive and aircraft components. 
  Titanium alloys, despite their high strength and corrosion 
resistance, have had limited applications because of their poor 
rigidity, roughly half that of steel. Sumitomo Metal did not use 
the typical, sintering method-based alloy production process to 
develop the new alloy, but rather used the grain dispersion 
composite alloy formation method, called the in-situ method, to 
melt, solidify and disperse titanium and Al-boron. Instead of 
using chrome and vanadium, which tended to decrease rigidity, 
aluminum and boron were used and crystallized on the alloy 
surface. Thus, microfine titanium boride single crystals were 
dispersed uniformly to show excellent conformity between grains 
and the matrix in the new alloy. 
  The boron content of the new alloy was optimized at 
approximately one weight percent to maintain excellent ductility 
and machinability for the new alloy, because these properties 
declined when the boron content was higher. 
  The newly developed high-rigidity alloy showed a Young's 
modulus value, an index for rigidity, of 15,000 
kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], which was 30 percent higher than 11,550 
kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy. 
Moreover, the new alloy's fatigue strength was 63 
kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], surpassing 45 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the 
previous material. Thus, the new alloy is suitable for use in 
components that require strength. 
  Specific applications being considered for the new alloy 
include automotive components, including exhaust system parts, 
such as valves, crankshafts, connecting rods and piston 
wristpins. Sumitomo Metal is all set to distribute samples of 
the new alloy and is hoping for its early commercialization.

  [Text] The rapidly solidified aluminum alloy developed by 
Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal), has been 
adopted for the construction of the rotor for the Lysholm 
compressor (a screw-type compressor) to be installed on Mazda 
Motor Corp.'s new automobile model, the (Yunos) 800. This 
compressor was originally developed by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries Co., Ltd., for the world's first mirror cycle engine 
to achieve the dual objectives of high performance and low fuel 
cost. Mazda Motor Corp. decided to use the aluminum alloy for 
the rotor, the requirements of which included that it be 
lightweight, have high heat resistance, and have a low thermal 
expansion coefficient. 
  The rapidly solidified aluminum alloy is produced in the 
form 
of an ingot from powder obtained by rapidly cooling and 
solidifying a molten aluminum alloy. The rapidly solidified 
alloy has a denser and more uniform structure than do alloys 
made by the traditional melting-casting method. In addition, it 
is possible to expand the limits for adding silicon and iron to 
the aluminum alloy with the rapid solidification process. 
Therefore, the new alloy is expected to become a heat- and 
wear-resistant, high-performance material with excellent 
machinability. 
  The new compressor to be used for (Yunos) 800 of Mazda Motor 
Corp. has the screw-type rotor, which combines the three-winged 
male part and the five-winged female part. In order to provide 
the highest possible performance, the compressor has been 
designed with extremely narrow clearances between the rotating 
male and female rotors and between the compressor casing and the 
rotors. 
  Therefore, the rotor material must be lightweight and highly 
heat-resistant, and it must have a low thermal expansion 
coefficient. Sumitomo Metal developed the new alloy to meet 
these requirements.

  [Text] [Nagoya] The group led by Professor Tetsuo Fujimoto, 
who is the head of the Department of Engineering at Nagoya 
University, developed a molecular beam technology for evaluating 
material surfaces of space shuttles and vacuum containers. By 
applying the technology on stainless steel, the group discovered 
that surface modification by means of silver ion plating was the 
most effective way to obtain an ultra-high vacuum material. 
  The technology involves irradiation of the surface of a 
material with an ultra-high-speed molecular beam, which passes 
through a rotating disk with slits and is cut into small 
segments, and the detection and analysis of the scattered 
molecular beams. This technology is suitable for composition 
analysis of a material's surface in many fields, including 
semiconductor surface analysis. 
  Ultraviolet, light-dissociated atomic oxygen exists more 
than 
100 km above the ground, and oxygen atoms are the main component 
200-700 km above the ground. Thus, the materials used to 
construct a space shuttle are exposed to these elements in space 
and subjected to surface corrosion due to chemical reactions. 
Also, the interference and adsorption of gaseous molecules on 
vacuum container material surfaces have caused problems. 
  Many studies have been conducted to modify the surfaces of 
vacuum materials, which have been evaluated by measuring the 
quantities of gases emitted by the materials. In particular, for 
the development of a new material, it is necessary to clearly 
understand the behavior of gaseous molecules at the material's 
surface. For this reason, Professor Fujimoto's group developed a 
gaseous molecular beam method that enabled direct examination of 
material surfaces. 
  The molecular beam used by the group involved two noble 
gases, helium and argon. This molecular beam was irradiated 
obliquely on the surface of a stainless steel piece, which is a 
commonly used vacuum material, and the reflected molecular beams 
were analyzed with a quadrupolar mass-spectroscopic analyzer. 
From these data, the group clarified the correlations between 
kinetic energy, surface temperature, incident angle and 
reflection angle, and the group was able to confirm that the 
superimposition of two spectra corresponding to the scattering 
and the adsorption/desorption processes was effective for the 
analysis of the spectra of reflected molecular beams. 
  As a result, the group concluded that ion plating was 
necessary to reduce the adsorption of gas molecules on the 
surface of stainless steel. The experiment was repeated with a 
piece of silver ion-plated stainless steel, and it was proven 
that the silver ion plating was an effective surface 
modification technology in obtaining ultra-high vacuum. Various 
ways to apply this technology are being examined to check 
material surfaces contaminated by gas molecules. Separately from 
this research project, Professor Fujimoto's group is in the 
process of developing a laser technology for detecting dilute 
gases.

  [Text] The stable existence of N60 was confirmed jointly by 
the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research 
(NIMCR), Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and Nissan 
Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan Motor). Increasingly promising lately is 
the potential for N60, the molecule consisting of 60 nitrogen 
atoms bonded in a soccer-ball shape, to be used as rocket fuel 
capable of generating the world's highest thrust. Supercomputer 
simulation confirmed the existence of N60 as the ``nitrogen 
version'' of the newly emerging promising material, C60, made of 
60 carbon atoms. Although a ``considerable amount of time is 
required for synthesizing N60,'' its development has already 
begun. 
  NIMCR's Chief Researcher Takehiro Matsunaga, who proposed 
the 
N60 concept, says this: ``When I saw the crystalline structure 
of C60, I immediately sensed that the world's most powerful 
explosive could be made if the same structure could be applied 
to nitrogen atoms.'' 
  NIMCR and Nissan Motor are jointly developing the 
next-generation rocket fuel. The joint team has been in search 
of a compound capable of generating a sufficiently powerful 
thrust to propel heavy rockets faster and farther. 
  Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can 
become powerful explosives. TNT, today's most widely used 
explosive, is also a nitrogen-containing compound. 
  Compared with oxygen and hydrogen, the atomic bonding force 
in nitrogen is greater, and therefore, when the bond is 
destroyed, larger energy is released. In other words, if a 
compound can be synthesized from nitrogen atoms only, the 
compound can be a powerful explosive. 
  From that standpoint, the crystalline structure of the 
soccer-ball-like C60 was the ideal shape for explosive 
researchers. The joint group of NIMCR and Nissan Motor computed 
the atomic radius and the molecular bonding energy and confirmed 
the existence of N60, consisting of 60 nitrogen atoms, and N70, 
consisting of 70 nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, the group computed 
the magnitude of thrust when these molecules are used as rocket 
fuel. 
  The currently most advanced propulsion technology involving 
the reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is to be 
used for space shuttles and the next Japanese-made large rocket 
H2, which is scheduled to be launched in February 1994 by the 
National Space Development Agency. The technology makes use of 
the heat that is released when oxygen and hydrogen react. 
  Specific impulse, an index of a rocket's efficiency, for H2 
is approximately 445 seconds. By computation, the group obtained 
a specific impulse of approximately 550 seconds, approximately 
20 percent better than the above value, for the predicted N60, 
despite the common knowledge that it is almost impossible to 
improve specific impulse by even one second with today's fuel 
technology. 
  Another advantage of N60 as rocket fuel is that it is a 
solid. By applying high heat or impact, the energy accumulated 
in the material is released instantaneously. The liquid fuel to 
be used for H2 is difficult to handle and has a potential for 
leaking. It has been reported that the U.S. National Aerospace 
Agency has experienced more than 5,000 accidents in the area of 
engine development. Chief Researcher Matsunaga says, ``There is 
no doubt in my mind that the new nitrogen compound, if 
synthesized, will be the new rocket fuel.'' 
  There seems to be no clue to the synthesis method for the 
compound. It took five years for the synthesis method for C60 to 
be found after the computer prediction had been made for the 
existence of the molecule. Actually, the carbon molecule was 
isolated from soot produced by the electric discharge between 
carbon electrodes. In contrast with the C60 molecule, which is 
in the shape of a nearly perfect soccer ball, the N60 molecule 
predicted by the joint group has an indentation involving more 
than 10 nitrogen atoms. Because of this distorted shape, the N60 
molecule is said to be easily destroyed and difficult to 
synthesize. 
  The C60 molecule was synthesized with a systematic approach 
by gradually increasing the number of carbon atoms on a molecule 
consisting of 12 carbon atoms that was already in existence. On 
the other hand, nitrogen molecules containing four, six and 20 
atoms showed excessive strain in simulation tests, and their 
stable existence was negated. 
  Section Chief Katsumi Tanigaki of the Exploratory Research 
Department, NEC Basic Research Institute, points out that 
``unless an epoch-making synthetic method is found, it will be a 
long road before we see the actual N60 molecule.'' He suggests 
that the group should ``first check the possibility of 
synthesizing a molecule consisting of carbon and nitrogen.'' 
  According to the super-computer simulation, the N60 molecule 
is supposed to generate the world's greatest explosive force. 
Although a long road of synthesis is ahead, we must hope for the 
best for future research. As Section Chief Tanigaki says, we 
must ``go for it, as long as its existence has been predicted.''

<F P=106> [Article by Yasushi Uchida] </F>
  [Text] Furukawa Electric Industry Co., Ltd. (Furukawa 
Electric), has developed a highly heat-resistant, plastic-based 
optical fiber that can be used at temperatures of up to 
145ÎC. As a result of the adoption of a new, highly 
heat-resistant plastic for the optical signal transmitting core, 
the new fiber was found to have signal transmission performances 
greatly superior to those of silicone-based optical fiber, 
previously considered the most heat resistant, particularly 
under conditions of high temperature and high humidity. The 
fiber is being produced in two grades: one capable of 
withstanding a temperature up to 145ÎC, and the other, 
125ÎC. Their prices are approximately 4-9 times that of 
PMMA-based (poly-methylmethacrylate-based) optical fiber. 
Furukawa Electric plans to develop applications for the new 
optical fiber in automotive electrical equipment and optical 
sensors. 
  The performance of an optical fiber is essentially 
determined 
by its core material. Today, among plastic-based optical fibers, 
the PMMA core is the mainstream because PMMA has excellent 
optical transparency and optical transmission capability. 
However, PMMA is stable to temperatures in the 80-85ÎC range 
only. Spaces around an automotive engine sometimes reach 
temperatures as high as 120ÎC, which limits the use of PMMA. 
Also commercialized are optical fibers based on thermosetting 
silicone which is stable up to 150-170ÎC. However, such 
fibers do not have excellent transmission capability, and they 
tend to show serious deterioration at high temperature and 
humidity. 
  According to the explanation given by Furukawa Electric's 
Optical Technology Research Institute, the plastic used for the 
fiber core was ``a highly heat-resistant resin that had not seen 
much optical applications.'' The transmission loss in an optical 
fiber is mainly caused by the absorption of light as a result of 
the resonance between the signal light and carbon-oxygen 
molecular bonds that are usually present in plastic materials. 
Although full disclosure has not been made on the new fiber, the 
following has been reported: ``Much effort was given to reduce 
the molecular bonds that would resonate with signals of 
wavelengths of 660 and 760 mm, in order to minimize the 
absorption.'' As a result, the transmission loss with the new 
fiber was only 0.6 dB/m, which was worse than 0.2 dB/m of the 
PMMA fiber, but better than that 1.3 dB/m of the silicone-based 
fiber (see the attached table). 
  The new fiber did not change its transmission capability 
even 
after left standing at a temperature of 145ÎC. If that had 
been a PMMA fiber, its core would have melted and become 
incapable of optical transmission after one hour. Furthermore, 
the new fiber's transmission loss increased by only 0.2 dB/m 
after left standing for 500 hours in a high-temperature, 
high-humidity environment at 80ÎC and 95 percent relative 
humidity. Under the same conditions, a silicone-based fiber 
would ``absorb moisture resulting in serious optical scattering 
inside the core, and the transmission loss would increase by 1.5 
dB/m.'' 
  Another advantage of the new fiber over the silicone-based 
fiber is its machinability. An optical fiber needs to have a 
mirror finish on its end face in order to minimize the end-face 
scattering loss when optical signals enter the end face. It 
takes five minutes or so to cut and grind the end face of a 
thermosetting, hard silicone-based fiber, which can also be 
easily damaged. In contrast, the end face of the new optical 
fiber, being thermoplastic like PMMA, can be mirror-finished by 
simply pressing the face against a heated plate for less than 
one second.

  [Text] The Central Research Institute of Matsushita 
Electric Works, Ltd. (Matsushita Electric), jointly with 
Professor Koichi Niihara at the Industrial Science Research 
Institute of Osaka University, has developed new nano-composites 
in which nm-size, microfine molybdenum particles are uniformly 
dispersed in a matrix of yttria/partially stabilized zirconia 
(Y-PSZ or Y-TZP). With the addition of nano-microparticles of 
molybdenum to comparatively strong and tough PSZ to form the 
composite, ``the material manifested strength and toughness 
equivalent to those of super-hard alloys and corrosion 
resistance nearly equal to that of ceramics,'' according to the 
Functional Material Laboratory of the Central Research 
Institute. Within the next two to three years, Matsushita 
Electric plans to use the composite for electric tools' cutting 
edges and barber's equipment, including electric razors. 
  Nano-composites are reinforced ceramics created by forming 
residual stress fields with nm-size microparticles either in the 
ceramic crystalline grains themselves or in their boundaries. 
Nano-composite research activities have flourished because 
drastic improvement of bending strength and toughness is 
possible by the formation of the composite. Previously, the 
research concentrated on composite materials that combined 
dissimilar ceramics, e.g., alumina and silicon carbide. 
  With the aim of ``developing materials that are 
simultaneously strong, tough and corrosion-resistant,'' 
Matsushita Electric focused its attention on nano-composites 
containing ceramics and metal because previous nano-composites 
consisting of two ceramics had been poor in toughness. PSZ 
containing 3 mol-percent yttria (Y[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) 
was chosen as the ceramic matrix material. PSZ has excellent 
toughness and strength, since it undergoes the 
structure-reinforcing phase transition of its crystalline grains 
from cubic to monoclinic, when external stress is applied. The 
actual PSZ material used was Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s 
``TZ-3Y,'' with an average particle diameter of 300 nm. 
  The research group selected molybdenum for the metal 
component because of its high melting point, approximately 
2,600ÎC. In super-hard alloys, metallic properties, as 
opposed to ceramic, are dominant, because their metal component, 
cobalt, with a low melting point of 1,500ÎC, tends to cover 
the ceramic grain boundaries. Therefore, super-hard alloys have 
excellent toughness, but poor corrosion resistance. By using a 
high-melting metal, the group hoped to be able to overcome the 
poor corrosion resistance, the weakness of super-hard alloys. 
Thus, molybdenum was chosen because its readily wettable, 
micro-fine powder was commercially available. 
  The molybdenum powder, ``Mo-H-D,'' made by Nippon 
Shinkinzoku 
K.K., was obtained. The powder's average particle diameter was 
650 nm, and the particle size distribution curve showed two 
peaks, at 200 nm and 1,000 nm. 
  For the production of the new composite, the two raw 
material 
powders were mixed and then ball-milled together for 24 hours in 
acetone; the blend was sintered by the hot press method for one 
hour at 1,400-1,600ÎC, under 30 MPa pressure. The resulting 
sinter density was higher than 99.5 percent. 
  In the micro-structure of the sinter, molybdenum particles 
approximately 800 nm in diameter were seen precipitated in the 
grain boundaries of PSZ poly-crystals, also approximately 800 nm 
in diameter. Furthermore, 20- to 30-nm-diameter molybdenum 
nano-particles were also seen precipitated within PSZ particles. 
It is conjectured that PSZ crystal grains ``form nano-particles 
by incorporating molybdenum micro-particles inside.'' 
  The mechanical properties of the newly developed composite 
are strongly influenced by the amount of added molybdenum. The 
composite's bending strength increases as the molybdenum 
addition increases from zero through 30 volume-percent, above 
which the strength does not change significantly (Figure 2). The 
composite's toughness, on the other hand, hardly increases until 
the molybdenum amount reaches 30 volume-percent, and rapidly 
increases as soon as the molybdenum amount exceeds 30 
volume-percent. The explanation: ``As long as the molybdenum 
amount is 30 volume-percent or less, the composite's strength 
improvement is governed by the nano-particles. 
  When the nano-particles precipitate inside zirconia 
particles, the structure of zirconia becomes finer, and the 
composite's strength increases. On the other hand, as more 
molybdenum is added, molybdenum in the grain boundaries begins 
to grow to become sub-Êm-sized particles; hence, greater 
toughness. The composite's toughness becomes high because 
molybdenum in the boundaries can prevent the progress of any 
cracks that have been generated in the sinter, in addition to 
the PSZ's phase-transition reinforcing mechanism.'' 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-17A>           Figure 2. Bending Strength, Fracture Toughness Values of </FIG>




  The composite's mechanical properties, when 50 
volume-percent 
molybdenum was added, were determined as follows: bending 
strength was 1,800 MPa, and toughness was 17.5 
MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/]. These values were 1.8 and 4.2 times, 
respectively, the values with no molybdenum added. According to 
the group: ``We have never seen a nano-composite that has 
simultaneously manifested bending strength of 1,000 MPa and 
toughness of 10 MPa/m[.sup]1/2[/].'' The group confirmed the 
excellent corrosion resistance of the composite with a salt 
water spray test; thus, the group concluded that the material 
should have no problem in an ordinary environment. 
  The group feels that it needs to improve the composite's 
hardness, which decreases with the increase in the molybdenum 
quantity. When 40 volume-percent molybdenum is added, the 
composite's Vickers hardness HV is only 7-8 GPa, compared with 
19 GPa for alumina and 12 GPa for Y-PSZ. The reason was the 
hardness of molybdenum itself, which is only 2 GPa. The group 
plans to overcome this weakness of the composite by improving 
the control of the composite's micro-structure, i.e., the 
precipitation sites and numbers for nano-particles.

  [Text] For the first time in a long time, a new type of 
aluminum alloy with a new structure is about to enter the 
market. The promising new alloy is called the 
``quasi-crystalline particle dispersed aluminum alloy.'' For the 
time being, the alloy is made into a thin 20- to 30-Êm-thick 
tape. This new alloy was discovered by the research group of 
Professor Ken Masumoto, director of the Metal Technology 
Research Institute (MTRI) of Tohoku University, and Professor 
Akihisa Inoue, of the same institute, during the course of 
studies involving the super-rapid cooling/solidification of 
aluminum alloy-based amorphous alloys. 
  Of particular interest because of the potential commercial 
value are aluminum-manganese-nickel-based and 
aluminum-manganese-cobalt-based high-strength alloys that were 
developed jointly by MTRI and Yamaha Technical Research 
Institute. Those alloys have been found to show a tensile 
strength of 1,200 MPa, which is more than twice that of the 
heat-treated 2000-series super-duralmin (2017), which is 
currently used as a high-strength alloy. Moreover, the new 
alloys' tapes are so ductile that they do not crack even when 
bent 180Î and folded flat. 
  These quasi-crystalline particle-dispersed aluminum alloys 
are so called because spherical quasi-crystalline particles, 
with diameters ranging from 30 to 50 Êm, are uniformly 
dispersed in the matrix of an aluminum alloy. The quantities of 
the quasi-crystalline particles are 50 to 70 volume-percent. The 
``quasi-crystal'' was first discovered by Shechtmann's research 
group in Israel. At that time, there was no crystallographic 
explanation for the mysterious phase with quintuple symmetry 
found in a super-rapidly solidified aluminum-manganese alloy. It 
was clarified with the aid of a high-resolution electron 
microscope that the regular-icosahedral alloy contained many 
phase strains, called `(phase-on) strains,' internally. 
Subsequently, quasi-crystalline phases were discovered in two- 
and three-element alloys containing magnesium and titanium, and 
gradually the phase was understood to be a unique electron 
compound. Although the initial quasi-crystalline phases had been 
unstable quasi-stable phases, the first quasi-crystalline phase 
which was a stable, quasi-stable phase, was discovered in 1986 
in aluminum-lithium-copper-based alloys. 
  Having studied the above-mentioned series of 
quasi-crystalline phases, MTRI in 1992 developed an 
aluminum-manganese-cerium-based high-strength alloy in which 
several 10s-Êm-diameter spherical quasi-crystalline particles 
were dispersed, and it pursued further development of other 
implementable alloys in an accelerated fashion. However, for 
practical applications, the problem was to use rare-earth 
metals, such as cerium. According to ST Project Leader Toshiharu 
Hoshi of the Yamaha Technical Research Institute, ``when a 
rare-earth metal is used, production conditions become 
complicated because of its tendency to oxidation.'' In 1993, 
MTRI discovered that transition-metal elements such as 
manganese, cobalt and iron could replace cerium, and it began to 
take a gigantic step toward the practical implementation of the 
new alloys.

  [Text] In anticipation of future energy shortages the 
``Lunar Energy Station Initiative'' calls for construction of an 
energy station on the moon that will supply energy steadily to 
earth, has moved toward the stage of actual development. Now 
that the lunar energy station study group of the Foundation for 
Promotion of Material Science and Technology of Japan (MST) has 
completed its report based on a year-long investigation 
conducted by specialists from industry, government, and academic 
circles, the first meeting will be held on the 21st at Kogakuin 
University's Shinjuku campus in Tokyo. 
  The plan for the new nuclear power plant, which is the 
central theme of this energy development initiative for infinite 
space, will likely draw much attention. The new power plant is 
supposed to be able to convert electric energy directly from the 
thermal energy emitted from its reactor, using a functionally 
gradient material (FGM) ultra high efficiency energy conversion 
system for the reactor core structure. 
  The lunar energy station development initiative was based by 
several assumptions, including the inevitability of an energy 
crisis in the future, the need to promote the safety of ground 
nuclear power generation, the importance of an economical source 
of power for space development, and progress on development of 
FGM that can be used as a high efficiency thermoelectric 
conversion material. 
  The solar energy plant employs a new nuclear reactor concept 
that converts energy directly into electricity without using 
turbines and water like current nuclear power plants do. This is 
where FGM plays its role. 
  According to the plan, the electric energy thus produced 
will 
be transmitted to an energy relay station which travels in earth 
orbit in the form of a high transmission efficieny waveband 
laser beam. Then its wave length will be changed to a high 
atmospheric transmission efficiency waveband laser and sent to 
an energy receiver on the ground. From here, the electricity 
will be distributed to various places through a ground 
transmission system. 
  At the meeting, papers will be given by specialists who took 
part in the study. They will include the ``Energy and LEP (Lunar 
Energy Park) Initiative in the 21st century'' (by Masayuki Niino 
of the National Aerospace Laboratory) and subjects such as 
transportation systems to the moon, the lunar energy station, 
energy transmission to the earth, and ground receiving system. 
  FGM is a next generation new material with highly 
sophisticated functions. The idea originated in Japan. 
Production of FGM calls for a gradual change in the composition 
of the material from one side to the other. As a result, the 
properties on either side of the material are completely 
different. It is drawing much attention as a material useful for 
heat resistant structural materials for space as well as for the 
development of high efficiency and high power output energy 
conversion systems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-19A>           Graphic </FIG>



  Although the idea is still in the formative stage, giant 
projects such as this in space development require nationwide 
discussion and formation of a consensus, as well as a system of 
international cooperation. The lunar energy station study group 
hopes that communication on this subject will continue after 
this conference.

  [Text] Tanegashima--After a decade of development marred by 
two engine explosions, one fatality and a long lift-off delay, 
Japan launched its H-II rocket last week, a 260-ton declaration 
of independence from U.S. aerospace technology. 
  The blast-off of the 50-meter-high, &yen;270 billion ($2.45 
billion) rocket--the first such space vehicle entirely made in 
Japan--brought with it a medley of cheers and sighs of relief. 
  Pressure on the 800 engineers engaged in the operation, 
already intense due to a two-year-long delay, was heightened by 
last month's failure of a European Arianespace rocket in French 
Guiana. 
  ``Japan has finally completed a means of transportation in 
space that we can use at our free will,'' said Kenji Seyama, 
director of the Space Development Division at the Science and 
Technology Agency. 
  Yet the scientific achievement by the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) won't erase doubts that the 
satellite-launching business, from which the rocket could help 
to pay for itself, is already saturated worldwide. 
<H5>  Number 5 </H5>
  After all, Japan is merely taking its place behind four 
other 
nations in the ranks of space superpowers--the U.S., Russia, the 
European Arianespace consortium and China. 
  Japan has developed three major rockets over the past 30 
years, but each relied heavily on U.S. technology, and 
Washington placed restrictions on their use. 
  One major constraint on the H-I rocket, the H-II's 
predecessor, was that Japan was prohibited from launching 
foreign satellites with it. The H-II rocket, for its part, can 
lift a 2.2-ton satellite into geostationary orbit--35,786 km 
altitude above Earth--so it can launch almost any kind of 
satellite. 
  That means now that Japan is free from constraints, it can 
forge into the commercial launching business. But few officials 
seem all that enthusiastic about the idea. 
  ``The space development business isn't paying well at the 
moment, and we don't see a rosy future,'' said Hiroshi Harada, 
general manager of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' space systems 
department. 
  Added Jean-Louis Claudon, Asia-Pacific representative of 
Arianespace: ``Because the worldwide commercial-satellite market 
is not growing, and the number of rockets (needed to launch the 
satellites) is growing, the market is getting very competitive. 
It's not going to be easy for the competitors to make profits.'' 
  The pride of the H-II is the first-stage main engine, dubbed 
the LE-7, whose development caused the two explosions that 
claimed one life and delayed the launch. The engine is fueled by 
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen--the H for H-II stands for 
hydrogen--and functions in the same way as the motor of the U.S. 
space shuttle. 
  Yet even though the H-II's technology is advanced, that is 
``not really important from the point of view of 
commercialization,'' said Arianespace's Claudon. The technology 
``doesn't mean much to customers,'' who attach greater 
importance to proven reliability and cost, he said. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
estimates that the annual domestic space industry market is 
&yen;308 billion. Yet in a departure from usual practice, MITI 
has declined to project the future size of the market, 
implicitly acknowledging that the question is too politically 
charged. 
  The reason: Two-thirds of the &yen;308 billion cost comes 
from the national budget, and ``the question of how big a market 
it will become is equivalent to asking how much the government's 
allowance is going to increase,'' said Masao Omichi, director of 
MITI's Space Industry Division. 
<H5>  Small budget </H5>
  The government's total space-related budget for fiscal 1993, 
ending next March, is &yen;201.7 billion ($1.83 billion), 
whereas NASA in the United States spent $14.33 billion in fiscal 
1993. 
  ``We won't be able to get along without depending on the 
national budget,'' although government projects are not 
profitable, said Harada of Mitsubishi Heavy. Half the money 
spent on making the H-II was collected by Mitsubishi, Japan's 
largest launching-vehicle producer, which records space-related 
sales of up to &yen;50 billion a year. 
  ``The development of the H-II is designed to advance Japan's 
technology'' rather than generate new business, said Harada, 
echoing the comments by many of those involved in the space 
program here. 
  The H-II is booked until its sixth launching in summer 1997. 
Apparatus such as the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite and 
Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite will 
be hoisted. 
  Although several more satellites are planned to come after 
that, none of them are for commercial purposes. 
  ``The future of the H-II is utterly black,'' said Nobuo 
Nakatomi, an aerospace analyst who is a fellow scientist at NASA 
of the United States. 
  ``Japan has to think seriously about which area the H-II can 
be most useful,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it seems that no one 
here is doing that.'' 
<H5>  Unmanned Shuttle Planned </H5>
  But commercial uses or not, Japan still has big plans for 
the 
H-II. 
  The rocket is meant to hoist the nation's unmanned space 
shuttle--dubbed HOPE--by the year 2010, although its development 
is still in the primary stages. 
  An orbital re-entry experiment (OREX) vehicle launched on 
the 
H-II rocket's maiden flight is designed to contribute to the 
construction of the HOPE. Two hours after the lift-off, the OREX 
vehicle successfully splashed into the Pacific Ocean, after it 
completed transmitting all the important basic data to the 
ground stations on how it endured the 1,600 C heat and other 
conditions in re-entering the atmosphere. Also, NASDA will be 
trying to work out plans to send man to the moon with the H-II 
to investigate and collect resources. 
  Still, two significant barriers remain for the space 
program, 
said Hiroshi Imamura, executive vice president of Rocket System 
Corp., Japan's only rocket-purchasing and launching company that 
was established in 1990 by NASDA and 75 aerospace firms. 
  One is that the H-II may be launched from Tanegashima--40km 
off the southern coast of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost main 
island--only twice a year. 
  NASDA pledged to five fishermen's unions that operate in the 
surrounding waters that the rocket will be launched only during 
a 45-day period during the summer and a similar period in the 
winter, times when fishermen take breaks from work. 
  The other barrier is the vast cost of the undertaking. 
  It costs about &yen;19 billion for a single launching of the 
H-II, &yen;16 billion of which goes toward manufacturing the 
vehicle. 
  Arianespace, the world's first commercial 
satellite-launching 
company that now holds about 60% of the market, charges 
only 
half the price that Japan's H-II would. Arianespace launches a 
satellite once a month on average, although its next launch will 
be delayed for a few months because of the January mishap. 
  When the H-II was initially planned 10 years ago, the 
currency-exchange rate was &yen;220 to the dollar. Since then, 
the yen has surged up to the &yen;110 level, which makes it hard 
for Japan to compete in the commercial launching market. 
  Not surprisingly, Imamura said his company is ``trying to 
find a way to reduce costs by 30%.''

  [Text] The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) 
contributes to international cooperation in Earth environment 
observation by acquiring global observation data for studying 
the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, tropical rain 
forest reduction, and climatic anomalies. It will also help 
development of platform bus technology and inter-orbit data 
relay technology. Its utilization has attracted a wide range of 
interest internationally because multiple source environmental 
data can be obtained by the satellite. 
  ADEOS will carry nine sensors, including sensors developed 
by 
NASDA and other sensors solicited by the announcement of 
opportunity (AO) sensors domestically and abroad. Sensors are 
transferred to the system office after finishing development 
testing. They are then mated with bus equipment, and 
system-level development tests are conducted using the two 
models listed below. 
  1) Engineering Model (EM) 
  The EM is electrically equivalent to the flight model and 
undergoes system tests for the following objectives: 
  (1) Verify interfaces after installing sensors and bus 
equipment on the satellite; 
  (2) Verify the function and performance as a satellite 
system; 
  (3) Check for electromagnetic interference. 
  2) Structural and Thermal Model (STM) 
  The STM is equivalent thermally and structurally to the 
flight model. System STM tests are being conducted for the 
following purposes: 
  (1) Verify endurance to the vibrational, acoustic, and 
shock environments; 
  (2) Verify endurance against on-orbit thermal and vacuum 
environments; 
  (3) Verify the thermal control function. 
  Frequent interface coordination has been conducted so far. 
Satellite development in a new form is being conducted. This new 
form of satellite development includes advancing acquired data 
evaluation in cooperation with each sensor organization when 
sensors are actually installed to conduct development tests as a 
system. 
  The EM tests finished in September 1993, and STM tests, in 
November 1993. The critical design review (CDR) will reflect the 
test results. ADEOS will be launched from Tanegashima Space 
Center in February 1996.

  The Communication Engineering Test Satellite (COMETS) began 
development in March 1991, and completed preliminary design with 
the successful completion of its preliminary design review 
(PDR). The results of the design are outlined below. 
  COMETS seeks to develop the following three new 
communication 
and broadcasting technologies: 
  (1) Inter-satellite communication technology using a large 
antenna of 3.6 m diameter with a gimbal mechanism; 
  (2) Advanced satellite broadcasting technology for 
high-quality local broadcasting using a 21-GHz-band 200 W 
amplifier; 
  (3) Advanced mobile satellite communication to meet 
diversified mobile communication requirements. It will also 
attempt to develop the following performance upgrading 
technologies for large geostationary satellites: 
  (1) Multi-frequency-band satellite system construction 
technology; 
  (2) Highly efficient power supply system; 
  (3) Propulsion system with apogee engine and reaction 
control 
systems integrated; 
  (4) Attitude control system which operate harmoniously with 
large antenna drive control. 
  The major characteristics of COMETS based on the results of 
the preliminary design are shown in Table 1. On-orbit appearance 
and the appearance at lift-off are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. 
  The main results of the preliminary design are described 
below. 
  (1) A structure with an antenna tower in the center was 
designed to enable housing three large antennas effectively (see 
Fig. 2). 
  (2) Engineers established the detailed specifications of the 
frequency and performance for each of the three mission systems 
verified by analysis that each development objective can be 
attained. They also confirmed by analysis that there was no 
mutual frequency interference problems. They will use the 
development model test to validate the results. 
  (3) Various problems arose in integrating the large flexible 
solar paddles with the satellite attitude control due to the 
complex paddle flexibility, but engineers verified that it is 
possible to attain the predetermined control accuracy by 
revising the paddle design and optimizing the attitude control 
system. 
  (4) Designers clarified that it is necessary to fold back 
the 
deployed solar paddle because of its problematic strength during 
the apogee engine burning. They studied number of apogee engine 
burning and redesigned the paddles to improve reliability. In 
the paddle development model test, the engineers will validate 
reliability fully by conducting folding and deployment test in a 
simulated space environment.

  [Text] Aerospace Industry Bureau Director Neymark of the 
Russian Federation Committee, has been invited to Japan by the 
Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC) (Chairman, 
Fuji Heavy Industries President Isamu Kawai). He emphasized the 
importance of Japan-Russia exchange in the area of commercial 
aircraft development at a press interview on 26 January at a 
hotel in Tokyo. First he mentioned the status of the Russian 
aircraft industry in which non-military demand is increasing 
rapidly, while military demand has dropped from 70% of the 
total in 1989 to 25% today. ``It is possible to develop 
jointly 
with Japan on a wide scale, including everything from smaller 
100-seat aircraft to larger 500-seat aircraft,'' he added. 
  He said ``the Russians do not have enough information as of 
now'' to be able to judge at exactly which technological level 
the Japanese aircraft industry is. However, he expressed high 
expectations in onboard electronic equipment to which 
sophisticated electronic technologies have been applied. 
  Prior to the press interview, the Director paid a courtesy 
visit to MITI's Aircraft and Ordnance Division of the Machinery 
and Information Industries Bureau and proposed wide-ranging 
technical exchanges including joint basic research efforts. 
  SJAC had signed a memorandum of understanding concerning 
four 
items during their delegation's visit to Russia in May 1993. 
They include: 
  1) information exchange and evaluation on joint commercial 
aircraft development; 
  2) invitations to Russian aircraft industry officials. 
  The visit by Director Neymark to Japan this time was 
arranged 
as part of that MOU.

  [Text] Professor Daiichiro Sugimoto and his group at the 
Department of Liberal Arts Education, University of Tokyo, have 
developed a parallel processing computer exclusively for 
high-speed simulation of the birth of galaxies in space. Its 
computational speed of 36 gigaflops exceeds that of general 
purpose supercomputers. They claim that the new computer could 
be used for simulating fluid dynamics and electromagnetic fields 
in addition to astrophysics. 
  For now it will be used exclusively for analysis of 
many-body 
problems, as it is known in mathematics, including simulation of 
shape changes and unity of galaxies. The computation is done 
through a workstation by connecting 6 substrates in parallel, 
which were developed for solving this particular problem. Each 
substrate contains 8 LSIs (large-scale integrated circuits) 
which were developed jointly with Fuji Xerox. 
  An astronomical amount of computation is required to 
calculate the gravities among many stars when it comes to 
simulation in cosmic science. Computation time increases twice 
squared with an increase in the number of the stars. Therefore, 
accurate analysis using general purpose supercomputers has been 
difficult. 
  The new computer is able to handle complex calculation such 
as gravity using LSIs, while the workstation can handle the 
remaining processing such as display. As a result, its 
computation speed exceeded the maximum speed of 32 gigaflops 
attained by general purpose Japanese supercomputers. The LSI is 
especially structured with a combination of operational units 
which accommodates the computation procedures of gravity. Thirty 
calculations per each operation made the high speed computation 
possible. 
  At 3 watts per gigaflop power consumption is minimal and 
requires no cumbersome coolant. The new computer set is small 
enough to be easily placed on desks, measuring approximately 25 
cm long, 25 cm wide, and 40 cm deep. 
  They plan to produce a 1-teraflop capacity set by about 
April 
1995. An LSI designed exclusively for that purpose is already 
under development.

  [Text] Since the 1957 launching of the Vostok I 
satellite, the world's space utilization has been making rapid 
progress, mainly in the fields of observations of various kinds 
and communication satellites. Utilization of the space 
environment began with the Skylab project of the United States 
and became steadily established with the 1983 launch of the 
space shuttle/skylab. Thus, utilization of the space environment 
is a relatively new field. 
  Utilization of the space environment means conducting 
various kinds of space experiments that cannot be carried out on 
the Earth, making use of the special environment of space. This 
offers conditions of microgravity, high vacuum, extremely low 
temperature, etc., conditions that can be obtained on orbits 
around the Earth. 
  Japan's utilization of the space environment began with 
the first material processing test (FMPT) carried out in 
September 1992 and will become fully-fledged with the scheduled 
construction of a space station at the onset of the 21st 
century. 
  The following passage gives a description of space 
environment utilization, how Japan is tackling the subject, and 
what prospects are seen in the field. 
<H5>  Microgravity </H5>
  In a space ship orbiting the Earth, the centrifugal force 
applied on the ship offsets the gravitational force of the Earth 
and gravity does not work. Utilitization of the microgravity 
environment presents itself as the biggest progress made so far 
in the attempt to utilize the space environment. We are living 
on the surface of the Earth, subjected to the Earth's gravity 
and protected by its atmosphere. In such an environment, man has 
been investigating various phenomena and making use of the 
findings. 
  Various parameters, such as temperature and pressure, 
seriously affect the chemical and physical activities of 
substances in scientific tests. The investigation of such 
phenomena was, however, made on the Earth because there was no 
need to consider a different environment. 
  Today, however, the progress made in scientific technology 
points to the need for more essential research and the 
utilization of various phenomena. An environment without gravity 
is certain to enable man to look for new materials that cannot 
be produced on the Earth and to investigate life and other basic 
phenomena, bringing much new knowledge. 
  We have so far been analyzing various phenomena and 
utilizing 
the findings in the world filtered by gravity. If this filter is 
eliminated, what had been invisible so far should become visible 
and what had been visible should appear differently. 
  Various space experiments can be performed, utilizing such a 
condition. The following are the space experiments Japan has 
carried out. 
<H5>  1. First Material Processing Test (FMPT) </H5>
  A Japanese astronaut boarded the space shuttle in September 
1992 for the first time and a full-fledged space test was 
carried out jointly by Japan and the United States. This is the 
FMPT. 
  During the eight-day flight of space shuttle Endeavor, 22 
themes of Japanese material tests, 12 themes of Japanese life 
science tests and nine themes of U.S. tests, or a total of 43 
theme tests were conducted. Japan was able to complete all tests 
on 34 themes. 
  The FMPT suffered a ten year setback due to a delay in the 
U.S. space shuttle project and the 1986 Challenger explosion. 
However, this enabled Japan to make full preparations. Problems 
that occurred during the FMPT were solved by the efforts of 
related people and good luck, providing Japan with a precious 
experience. 
  The FMPT was a manned space experiment carried out by 
Japanese payload specialist Mamoru Mohri which gave Japan 
valuable data on manned space technology. The TV screening of 
Dr. Mohri working aboard the shuttle gave many Japanese young 
people a keen interest in scientific technology and provided a 
chance to prevent them from avoiding scientific study courses. 
  In the FMPT, it was learned that semiconductors of a high 
purity and quality that could not be produced on the Earth were 
able to be produced in space. An explosion phenomenon that could 
not be explained with conventional theories was also observed. 
Other test results pointing to the prospect of the utilization 
of space environment have also been announced. 
<H5>  2. International Microgravity Laboratory (IML) Project </H5>
  The International Microgravity Laboratory Project is a 
mission to conduct a series of microgravity experiments aboard 
space shuttles and the space lab of the U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It is an 
international mission for institutes of Japan, the United 
States, Europe and Canada to carry out various kinds of space 
experiments. 
  Japan joined in the IML-1 held in January 1992 and conducted 
two tests on crystal growth of organic superconducting metal and 
on the detection and analysis of high-energy space radiation 
using biological samples. 
  In the experiment into the crystallizing of organic 
superconducting metal, well-formed crystals able to endure 
structure analysis were obtained in a short period of time and 
the prospect of tests on the growth of crystals in space was 
improved. The IML-2 is scheduled to be held around July 1995 
with Japan mounting six kinds of test devices for tests on 12 
themes, centering on life science. 
  It was decided in October last year that astronaut Chiaki 
Mukai, who won a high reputation in Japan and the United States 
for assisting the FMPT on the ground, is to board the space 
shuttle used in the IML-2. She is now undergoing training for 
conducting tests on as many as 80 themes presented by various 
countries. 
<H5>  3. SFU </H5>
  The SFU is a space experiment and observation system that 
can 
be recollected and used again. Unlike conventional artificial 
satellites, the SFU is planned to be launched with the H-II 
rocket now under development, to various kinds of space tests 
and observations in the orbit for a certain period of time and 
to be recollected on board a U.S. space shuttle for later use. 
<H5>  Space Environment Utilization and Manned Space Activities </H5>
  There has been much discussion on whether space activities 
should be manned or unmanned. The current conclusion seems to be 
that that which can be done without the need of human 
supervision should be done by machine and that which needs human 
supervision should be done manned. 
  After the second world war, there was remarkable progress in 
robot technology and this led to heated discussion on whether 
human supervision was necessary or whether robots should be used 
as far as possible. The search for coordination between man and 
robots may last forever. 
  The good points of both man and robots must be fully 
utilized 
in space development. For example, earth observation satellites 
and communications, which operate constantly and do not need to 
make timely changes in their functions, can remain unmanned. 
  In the field of space environment utilization, many space 
tests require timely handling by man. A manned space test has 
the merit of on-the-spot observation and the timely handling of 
trouble, while an unmanned space test can be conducted in 
microgravity environment better and at a relatively lower cost. 
  The robots to be used must master professional human skills, 
but they are yet in the learning process. Various kinds of data 
should perhaps be collected by manned activities for the time 
being, and technology for unmanned activities should be 
developed, using the accumulated data. 
  The FMPT proved that human activities in space can raise 
people's consciousness toward scientific technology. The TV 
screening of astronaut Mohri's space activities revived people's 
interest in scientific technology. The source of the evolution 
of living things born on the Earth has been the curiosity toward 
and the search of the unknown. 
  Japan is now training would-be astronauts to board a space 
station. Among the trainees, Koichi Wakata completed his 
training at NASA and was recognized as a mission specialist 
(MS), and a qualified astronaut by NASA. Wakata is expected to 
participate in high-level system operation training in readiness 
for the opportunity of space flight. 
  Astronaut Takao Doi was employed by NASDA together with 
Mohri 
and Mukai as staff for the FMPT and offered ground support of 
the FMPT tests in orbit. Doi will participate in the mission 
specialist training course to begin in fiscal 1994 to get an MS 
license. 
  In Japan, would-be astronauts are generally recruited 
publicly, and those who are accepted must abandon their past 
careers. They have to be prepared for this shift, while the 
employer, on his side, is obliged to duly reward them. The 
continuous employment of future astronauts must be elaborately 
planned with consideration due to the training of staff to board 
the space station. 
<H5>  Toward the Space Station Era </H5>
  Japan, the United States, Europe and Canada plan to jointly 
construct a space station on an orbit at an altitude of about 
400 kilometers from the end of this century through the early 
21st century. The space station is a lasting, multi-purpose 
manned space facility. 
  Each country is to supply its own station parts and offer 
some of its station space to the United States, in charge of 
constructing common parts, in exchange for electricity and other 
resources to be offered by the United States. 
  Japan is promoting a project to develop, operate and utilize 
a Japanese experimental module (JEM), which will enable Japan to 
conduct manned space tests regularly over a long period of time. 
  Japan has been openly inviting suggestions on experimental 
themes. In July this year, a primary selection of 50 themes for 
tests aboard JEM was made after an invitation of such test 
themes was issued in October last year. The test themes will be 
elaborated and the equipment to be mounted on JEM will be 
decided three years prior to the tests. 
  At present, suggestions of test themes are to be accepted 
until six years prior to the tests. This is according to the 
condition that international adjustment for testing plans is to 
be completed within five years before the test time and that the 
final decision of test themes is to be reached within three 
years prior to the tests. Moreover, space tests require 
elaborate preparations. 
  Japan has just begun to plan its space experiments and must 
improve its software and hardware for the efficient compilation 
of test plans. By accumulating space experiment technology, 
Japan must make efforts to shorten the period it requires 
between the proposal of themes and the actual holding of the 
tests. 
  Space experiments are very costly and require long, 
elaborate 
preparations, including preliminary tests. It is not something 
that can be done quickly. Therefore, it is necessary to dig out 
the latent needs of the researchers who wish to conduct space 
tests but are unable to do so. While taking a practical 
approach, it is required to make systematic, well-planned 
promotion of ground researches, preliminary testing and space 
experiments. 
  To meet this end, Japan is studying how to conduct space 
experiments on the basis of cooperative research structure that 
makes the utmost use of brains, technology and knowledge held by 
the industrial, academic and governmental circles pertaining to 
hopeful research themes. 
  After the end of the Cold War, space development competition 
between the United States and the Soviet Union ended and various 
countries are presently studying plans to utilize the space 
environment in many fields. Japan, too, will be urged to 
positively tackle space environment utilization and to achieve 
good results.

  [Text] Earth observation by satellite was started in 1978, 
when Earth Observation Center (EOC) of the NASDA (National Space 
Development Agency of Japan) was set up in Saitama Prefecture, 
just north of Tokyo, and started receiving data from the 
American LANDSAT satellite. The history of Japanese remote 
sensing had really begun. 
  In 1987, the reception of data from the Japanese Marine 
Observation Satellite (MOS-1) was started. This was followed by 
reception of data from the French earth observation satellite 
SPOT in 1988, from MOS-1b in 1990, from the European Remote 
Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) in 1991 and from the Japanese Earth 
Resources Satellite (JERS-1) in 1992. 
  At present, data are being regularly received from six 
Japanese and foreign earth observation satellites at EOC. The 
earth observing data is steadily increasing and becoming 
completely. [sentence as printed] 
  Earth observation by satellites has been steadily promoted, 
because the observation by satellites is better than other 
observation methods to cover wide area of earth and make regular 
observations in a long term. Satellite observing data have been 
mainly used to survey land use, farm crops and to monitor active 
volcanoes in disaster prevention. 
  In addition to the above, Japan, Europe and the United 
States 
have been promoting projects to use satellites to monitor the 
conditions of the global environment as the interest in earth 
environment problems has mounted in recent years. 
  Under these circumstances, Japan is operating or is 
developing the following earth observation satellites: 
<H5>  Marine Observation Satellite MOS-1/1b </H5>
  MOS-1 whose main object is the global marine observation 
carries three observation sensors: a Multi-Spectral Electric 
Self-Scanning Radiometer (MESSR) for detailed observation of 
land and ocean areas, a Visible and Thermal Infrared Radiometer 
(VTIR) to monitor clouds and sea surface temperature, and a 
Microwave Scanning Radiometer (MSR) to observe the sea surface, 
moisture in the atmosphere, ice on the sea, snowfall, etc. 
  MOS-1 was launched into Sun Synchronous Subrecurrent at an 
altitude of about 900 kilometers in February 1987, and MOS-1b, 
which is the successor of MOS-1, was launched in February 1990. 
Both MOS-1 and MOS-1b are still in operation and are sending 
large volumes of precious earth observation data. 
<H5>  Japanese Earth Resources Satellite, JERS-1 </H5>
  JERS-1 is principally designed to survey resources, and it 
also conducts earth observations to help land surveying, 
agriculture, fisheries, preservation of the environment, 
disaster prevention and coastal watching. This satellite also 
has the mission to develop a high-level earth observation system. 
  JERS-1 carries Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which is 
capable of making a detailed observation of land surfaces, 
regardless of day or night or weather condition, by transmitting 
microwaves and detecting the reflection on the land surface, 
functioning in a similar way to radar on the plane. JERS-1 is 
also equipped with Optical Sensor (OPS) which have the capacity 
to survey resources and obtain marine information with an 
improved version of MESSR on MOS-1 and also make precise, 
three-dimensional shapes of land surface by combining the data 
obtained with two kinds of functions. 
  This satellite was launched in February 1992 into Sun 
Synchronous Subrecurrent at an altitude of approximately 570 
kilometers and is now gathering data which is useful mainly in 
the surveying of natural resources. 
<H5>  Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, ADEOS </H5>
  ADEOS is designed to make an international contribution by 
monitoring global-scale changes in conditions of the earth 
environment. ADEOS is also designed to develop the platform 
technology necessary for the development of future satellites 
and relaying of data obtained by earth observation satellites. 
  ADEOS is to be mounted with the Ocean Color and Temperature 
Scanner (OCTS) which has the ability to monitor the basic 
productivity of the ocean on a global scale and ocean currents 
by observing ocean color and temperature at high frequency and 
with high sensitivity. OCTS uses numerical observation 
wavelengths in the visible as well as infrared ranges. 
  It is also being planned that ADEOS will carry an Advanced 
Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR) which will 
contribute to environment monitoring by acquiring data on plants 
and ground conditions through observation mainly of land and 
coastal areas. The observation is to be made by using 
observation wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared ranges 
and with high definition. 
  The satellite is also to carry five sensors, two of which 
are 
from Japan, two from America and one from France. These sensors 
will observe wind direction above the ocean, ozone volume and 
the greenhouse effect gases of earth environmental problems. 
  This satellite is scheduled to be launched into Sun 
Synchronous Subrecurrent at an altitude of about 800 kilometers 
in the winter of 1996. 
<H5>  Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM </H5>
  The aim of TRMM is to obtain data by satellite on the 
intensity and location of rainfall in tropical areas. Such data 
are important to research the environment changes and global 
climate changes. 
  This satellite is the Japan-U.S. cooperation project. 
Japan's 
NASDA will be in charge of developing a rainfall observing radar 
system and launching the satellite, using an H-II rocket, while 
the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
will develop the satellite bus and observation equipment other 
than the rainfall radar and operate the satellite, using a data 
relaying satellite. 
  Japan is already developing a Precipitation Radar (PR) to 
observe the three-dimensional conditions of tropical rainfall, 
the rain's vertical condition in particular, and the amount of 
rainfall on the ocean and the land. Such data are important for 
investigating the energy cycle of the tropical regions that 
seriously effect the global environmental change. 
  To be developed in the United States are the TRMM Microwave 
Imager (TMI) to be operated jointly with the PR, Clouds and the 
Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and a Lightning Imaging 
Sensor (LIS). These sensors will all be mounted on the satellite. 
  TRMM is scheduled to be launched into Circular Orbit at an 
altitude of approximately 350 kilometers in the summer of 1997. 
<H5>  Geostationary Meteorological Satellite GMS Series </H5>
  The Geostationary Meteorological Satellite, GMS, Series are 
earth observation satellites for use in Japan's weather 
prediction and other climate research. The first GMS was 
launched in 1977, followed by the GMS-2 in 1981, the GMS-3 in 
1983 and the GMS-4 in 1989. They have been in operation for 
weather prediction and other climate researches. 
  The GMS is first launched into geostationary orbits and is 
spun at 100 times per minute for stability. The satellite scans 
the earth surface from west to east using this rotation. 
  GMS-5 is scheduled to be launched in the summer of 1994 for 
succeeding to the GMS-4 mission. 
  Japan's earth observation satellites have thus been used 
across a broad range, including weather prediction and disaster 
prevention, fields closely related to daily life, and earth 
environment monitoring, a matter of importance to all mankind. 
  The Science and Technology Agency has just completed the 
reports of the long-term scenario of Japan's earth observation 
satellites until 2010, which are including the satellites and 
ground systems developing plan, and the use of earth observation 
satellites for purposes other than global environment 
observation. 
  Based on this report, Japan is expected to promote the use 
of 
satellite data that have not been fully utilized yet and 
continue to develop new earth observation satellites in 
coordination with the earth observation satellite projects of 
foreign countries.

<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  The first flight of the U.S. space shuttle in April, 1981, 
heralded the era of winged space transfer and return vehicles. 
This successful flight spurred the research and development of 
winged transfer and return vehicles in various other countries 
and led to the launching of Buran by the former Soviet Union and 
the research and development of Hermes in Europe. 
  There are two conceivable types of space transfer and return 
vehicles--the winged type and the capsule type. The winged type 
is more effective when operation flexibility is required in 
missions, such as conducting experiments with large-sized 
equipment or quickly and accurately retrieving flying objects 
that elude high gravity loads. 
  Japan started research on a winged transfer and return 
vehicle around 1986 and has compiled the concept of its own 
unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an 
expendable launch vehicle, commonly called HOPE: H-II Orbiting 
Plane. 
  HOPE will be unmanned, have wings and be launched with an 
H-II launch vehicle or an H-II derivative launch vehicle. It 
will repair and refuel artificial satellites in space, conduct 
various kinds of experiments and observations utilizing the 
space environment, and transport materials to and retrieve 
materials from the Space Station. After carrying out various 
kinds of tasks, HOPE will reenter the atmosphere and land on the 
earth horizontally just as airplanes do. 
<H3>  Report of the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return 
Systems in the Space Activities Commission </H3>
  The Space Activities Commission approved on 20 July 1993, a 
report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and 
Return Systems (Chairman: Shigebumi Saito, Professor Emeritus at 
the University of Tokyo), calling for the research and 
development of such an unmanned winged transfer and return 
vehicle. 
  The advisory panel was set up by the Commission in June last 
year to study and discuss Japan's future policy for the research 
and development of space transfer and return systems. The Panel 
comprises 25 experts not only in the field of aeronautics and 
space, but also in other disrelated fields, including economics 
and law. The Panel has held five meetings beginning in November 
last year. 
  The following are the recommendations of the advisory panel 
in their report: 
<H5>  (1) Significance of Space Development </H5>
  The development of outer space within the range of the earth 
is man's exploration of future resources. The scientific 
activities in space to uncover the truth herald a new era for 
civilization and will bring more richness. 
  It is necessary for Japan, as an economic superpower and a 
science and technology power, to play an active part in the 
tackling of space development to fully utilize outer space 
within the range of the earth and thus contributing to 
international society. 
<H3>  (2) Significance and Necessity of Space Transfer and Return 
System </H3>
  The space transfer and return system is the base of space 
infrastructure, which is a basic system that is capable of 
handling a wide variety of missions. An infrastructure is 
necessary for efficient and flexible space development 
activities. 
  The transfer and return system is necessary for the service 
on orbits such as the verification, repair, re-supply, 
replacement and retrieval of satellites. The system is also 
needed to conduct experiments and observation, utilizing the 
space environment, and to transport cargo to a space station. 
The system is indispensable for Japan's stable implementation of 
space development activities in outer space within the range of 
the earth. 
  The research and development of such a system will largely 
contribute to the maintenance and development of transport 
technology, which is the keystone of space activities, as well 
as to the promotion of science and technology. 
<H3>  (3) Basic Concept of Research and Development of the 
Japanese Space Transfer and Return System </H3>
  It is important to promote the research and development of 
HOPE for practical purposes, this being an unmanned winged 
transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch 
vehicle, in the early 21st century. The needs for the transfer 
and return of cargo in space are likely to increase in the early 
2000s. Today, no other country is capable of providing an 
unmanned transfer and return system. Japan could build its own 
unique status in the world's space activities by the development 
of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE. 
Furthermore, the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle 
technology could ensure Japan's steady development of space 
technology for the future as basic technology for a manned 
transfer and return vehicle, a fully re-usable transport system 
and a space plane. 
<H5>  (4) Concrete Policy of Research and Development </H5>
  As a basic policy, Japan should divide the plans into two 
phases: the first stage is for the flight experiment R&amp;D 
plan; 
the second stage is for the development plan for practical use. 
At the first stage, it should be accomplished to acquire the key 
technology for HOPE within this century through the flight of 
the space re-entry flight experiment vehicle commonly called 
HOPE-X: HOPE-Experiment, which would enable Japan to establish 
the technology in the phases of launching, re-entering and 
landing. At the second stage, it should be accomplished to 
develop HOPE by means of adding the necessary mission 
capabilities after the first stage. The shift to the second 
stage should be strictly scrutinized by the Space Activities 
Commission, which should make policy judgment by fully checking 
technical achievement in the first stage. 
  The key roles in the research and development of the 
unmanned 
winged transfer and return vehicle should be played jointly by 
the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). 
<H5>  Outline of HOPE </H5>
  The winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE will be operated 
unmanned in whole processes, beginning with its launching, 
followed by entry into orbit, change of orbit, de-orbiting, 
returning and landing. 
  NASDA plans to set the gross weight of HOPE, to be launched 
by an H-II derivative launch vehicle, at about 20 tons. NASDA 
says HOPE should be able to transfer three to five tons of cargo 
to and from the Space Station, etc. 
  The dry weight of the HOPE vehicle, subtracting the weight 
of 
propellant and cargo from the gross weight, will be set at about 
ten tons and the vehicle structure weight, including heat 
protection materials, will be at about five tons. 
  The length of HOPE will be about 15 meters, the width of its 
wings about ten meters and its fuselage will have a diameter of 
about three meters. Tip fins with a height of about three meters 
will be installed at both ends of the main wings. 
  HOPE's total flight time, beginning with its launch followed 
by its stay in the orbit and ending with the landing, will be 
between four to seven days. 
  At the time of return, HOPE will de-orbit, using an orbit 
changing engine, reenter the atmosphere at an altitude of about 
120 kilometers and go through the aerodynamic heating control 
and balanced gliding phases. Adjusting its energy, the vehicle 
will finally reach the landing strip. 
  Two practical HOPE planes would be operated, and each would 
be launched once a year and would have a life of ten years. 
  Needed to develop HOPE are the aerodynamic technology to 
determine a vehicle shape that is able to cope with all speeds 
from hyper-sonic to low speed and the heat structure technology 
to endure aerodynamic heating at the time of reentry into the 
atmosphere. Also needed are guidance control technology for the 
automatic navigation of HOPE in all flight processes and the 
technology of long-life propulsion. Finally, a system technology 
to balance and combine the above is needed. 
  Therefore, as the first stage Japan is studying plans to 
develop critical technology and to conduct an orbital reentry 
experiment (OREX), automatic landing flight experiment (ALFLEX) 
and hyper-sonic flight experiment (HYFLEX), using small models 
to verify developed technology. Following the three kinds of 
flight tests, a flight test using an actual sized experimental 
model (HOPE-X) is planned as the goal of the first stage. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The establishment of the space transfer and return system 
is, 
thus, indispensable for Japan's future space activities and its 
contribution to the international society in the space 
development field. 
  The Science and Technology Agency, on the basis of the 
report 
compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return 
System, is to promote research and development, aiming at 
putting into practical use the unmanned winged transfer and 
return vehicle HOPE, launched by an expendable launch vehicle in 
the early 21st century.

<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  The history of Japan's space development began with the 
pencil rocket launching test conducted by the University of 
Tokyo in 1955. In 1969 National Space Development Agency of 
Japan (NASDA) was established. 
  Introducing U.S. technology, Japan developed the N-I rocket, 
followed by the N-II and H-I rockets. At present, an H-II rocket 
is under development designed solely with Japanese technology. 
The H-II rocket will deliver four times more power than its 
predecessor and will have a capability of launching a 2-ton 
class geostationary satellite. 
  When complete, the new rocket will move Japan to a 
world-class country in the field of space development. The 
following are the outline and future outlook of the H-II rocket. 
<H5>  Outline of H-II Rocket </H5>
<H5>  1) Purpose of Development </H5>
  The work on developing the H-II rocket (Fig. 1) started in 
1986 with the purpose of providing this country with her own 
world-level transport system and of promoting Japan's space 
activities. Based on Japanese technology acquired through rocket 
development and operation so far, the H-II rocket is designed to 
meet broad demands for the launching of 2-ton class 
geostationary satellites and other devices at an internationally 
acceptable launching cost. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-31A>           Fig. 1. Comparison of H-II Rocket With World's Major Rockets </FIG>




<H5>  2) Structure and Specifications </H5>
  The H-II rocket is a two-stage rocket with a high-power 
rocket engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as 
propulsion fuel and with an auxiliary engine in the form of a 
large-sized solid rocket booster. 
  The basic model of the H-II rocket is designed for launching 
a single geostationary triple-axis satellite. However, by 
changing its structure, the rocket is also capable of launching 
low- and medium-altitude satellites and multiple satellites. The 
H-II rocket is a transport system that will have the capacity, 
in the future, to meet a broad range of demands including the 
launching of moon and planet surveyors. 
  The H-II rocket is of a simple two-stage formation but has a 
vastly increased launching capability compared with Japan's past 
rockets by improving the propulsion and other systems. 
  The first-stage engine is LE-7 (Fig. 2), a two-stage 
combustion cycle type liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket 
engine now under development based on the technology of H-I 
rocket's second-stage engine, LE-5. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-32A>           Fig. 2. LE-7 Engine's System Chart </FIG>




  The development of a system using the two-stage combustion 
cycle method is difficult due to the high temperature and 
pressure of combustion gas which are higher than those of the 
gas generator method employed in the LE-5 engine. The new method 
has been adopted practically only in U.S. space shuttles and the 
former Soviet Union's Energia rocket. 
  The H-II rocket's second-stage engine is LE-5A, a liquid 
oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine of expander breed cycle 
type. The LE-5 adopted the gas generator method, but, for LE-5A, 
the method was changed into a structurally simple expander breed 
cycle system to gain improved functions and higher reliability. 
  Using LE-5A engine's re-ignition function, the H-II rocket 
is 
capable, in its second stage, of launching a satellite into a 
transfer orbit toward a geostationary orbit. 
  The solid rocket booster, SRB, is unlike the solid auxiliary 
rocket, SOB, adopted through the H-I rocket, a large-sized solid 
motor now being newly developed using solid propulsion fuel of 
composite type. The SRB has a movable nozzle for position 
control. 
  The H-II rocket will be fitted with large-sized satellite 
fairings of four and five meters in diameters, double the scale 
of those of the H-I rocket, to meet the future demand for 
large-sized satellites. 
  The guidance control of the H-II launcher will be of the 
inertia guidance control type, similar to the one employed in 
the H-II launcher, but the H-II attitude control method will 
change from the H-I platform method to the strap down method. 
<H5>  Development of H-II Rocket </H5>
  The H-II rocket is being developed solely with Japanese 
technology and the work of development has faced one 
technological difficulty after another. It was particularly 
difficult to develop the LE-7, the main first-stage engine. The 
following are the outlines of the LE-7 engine. 
<H5>  1) Current World Situation </H5>
  Rocket engines use oil fuel, liquid hydrogen fuel, solid 
fuel, etc.; among these, liquid hydrogen provides the highest 
performance. However, the use of liquid hydrogen fuel involves 
serious technological difficulties and only the United States, 
the former Soviet Union, Japan and the European Space Agency 
have successfully operated or developed engines with thrusts of 
more than 100 tons. 
<H5>  2) Technological Problems </H5>
  Liquid hydrogen has an extremely low temperature of minus 
253 
degrees centigrade and liquid oxygen minus 183 degrees. If air 
remains in the movable parts of the engine, lubricant oil 
freezes, and the engine fails to operate fully. 
  The combustion temperature of the gas rises to 3,200 to 
3,300 
degrees centigrade, melting or burning ordinary metals. 
  Rocket engines show high performance as combustion pressure 
is increased. To take advantage of this merit, the high-pressure 
combustion method is employed, requiring the development of 
high- pressure combustion technology and high-pressure turbo 
pumps of large power to send propellant into the combustion 
chambers under high pressure. 
  Thus, the development of a large-sized liquid oxygen or 
hydrogen engine contains technological difficulties in handling 
simultaneously the three factors of extremely low temperature, 
extremely high temperature and extremely high pressure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-33A>           Figure </FIG>



<H5>  3) Purposes of LE-7 Development </H5>
  One of the purposes of developing the LE-7 engine is to 
provide high-performance launch vehicles with large-sized liquid 
oxygen/hydrogen engines to utilize space environment and send 
explorers to nearby planets in the near future. 
  Another purpose is to establish liquid hydrogen technology 
as 
the fuel considered the best for the future scramjet, an air 
inducting ultra-sonic speed combustion engine, which is to power 
a single-stage rocket. Such a rocket is currently thought of as 
the best space transport system in the next generation. 
<H5>  4) Current Situation of LE-7 Development </H5>
  The work to develop the LE-7 engine started simultaneously 
with the development of the H-II rocket and is under way, 
overcoming various technological difficulties. In November 1992, 
the engine design was determined. Combustion tests, combining 
the LE-7 engine with the first-stage rocket body, were held from 
February through July 1993. 
  As a result, the development of the LE-7 engine is nearing 
completion and the H-II rocket took a giant stride toward the 
maiden flight in February 1, 1994. 
<H5>  Future of H-II Rocket </H5>
<H5>  1) H-II Rocket Launching Plans </H5>
  The H-II rocket's test flight No. 1, TF No. 1, is scheduled 
to be launched in February 1, 1994 and launching plans have 
already been decided through the sixth test flight (The 
launching schedule in Table 1 is as per the space development 
plans decided on 15 March 1993). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-34A>           Table 1. Satellite Launching Schedule by H-II </FIG>




   The TF No. 1 (scheduled for launch in 1 February 1994) is 
planned to carry payloads for confirmation of functions (VEP) 
and an Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX). The TF No. 2 
(scheduled for launch in August-September, 1994) is to launch 
the Engineering Test Satellite VI (ETS-VI), and the TF No. 3 
(scheduled for launch in January-February, 1995) will launch the 
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS-5) and the Space 
Flyer Unit (SFU). 
  The flight No. 4 (scheduled for launch in January-February, 
1996) is to launch the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite 
(ADEOS); the flight No. 5 (January-February 1997), the 
Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite 
(COMETS); the flight No. 6 (August-September 1997), the Tropical 
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Engineering Test 
Satellite VII (ETS-VII). 
<H5>  2) Future Plans </H5>
  Studies are being made on H-II-derived rockets to meet 
future 
launching demands on the basis of the H-II development 
technology, such as a plan to strengthen the capability of 
launching payloads into low orbits. 
  Japan needs to develop its own space transport system to 
supply and recollect commodities for the utilization of the 
space environment. The research and development of the unmanned 
winged shuttle HOPE (H-II Orbit Plane) has been conducted with 
the target of first flight by the early 2000s. There is a plan 
to use an H-II-derived rocket to launch HOPE. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The H-II rocket is thus Japan's mainstay launch vehicle in 
the future and has broad potentials to meet various needs. When 
this rocket is completed, Japan will be able to further 
contribute to international cooperation in the field of space 
development and make giant strides toward the construction of 
space infrastructure.

<H5>  Current Situation in Japan </H5>
  Japan's space development activities began in 1955 when the 
University of Tokyo succeeded in launching pencil-like small 
rockets. Later, in 1970, Japan's first satellite ``Ohsumi'' was 
successfully launched. 
  In 1957, the Soviet Union succeeded in launching the first 
satellite ``Sputnik-1.'' In 1969, an American made man's first 
landing on the moon, using Apollo-11. In those days, Japan was 
considerably behind these advanced countries in the technology 
level. The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) 
was set up also in 1969. 
  Through efforts made to enhance its own technology, Japan's 
space development has made steady progress, however, and is 
about to establish its own technology equal to that at the top 
international level, as witnessed in the progress of the 
development of the H-II rocket for launching large-sized 
satellites. 
<H5>  Significance of Space Development </H5>
  First of all, space has infinite possibilities for those who 
seek the truth. The scientific research on space may clarify the 
origins of the universe and organisms and should lead to the 
creation of a cultural era for all mankind. 
  Secondly, the quality of life can be improved, and the 
economy and society can progress through the space activities, 
such as communication broadcasting via satellites, 
meteorological observation and earth observation from space. 
  Thirdly, space development can create new spheres for 
mankind's activities, including space environment utilization 
activities, in which the development of new materials is 
expected. Space activities enable mankind to make use of outer 
space and its resources. 
  Fourthly, the challenge of developing space will require 
interweaving of mankind's wisdom and various advanced 
technologies. This will contribute to intellectual creation and 
the development of new technology. In this sense, space 
activities inherently require international cooperation and will 
promote creation of an international cooperative society. 
<H5>  Fundamental Principles of Space Activities </H5>
  The highest decision-making organization of Japan's space 
activities policy is the Space Activities Commission (SAC). SAC 
has published the national fundamental policy of Japan's space 
development which established long-term goals and political 
guidelines for Japan's space development activities covering 10 
to 15 years. The latest review of the Long-Term Policy was made 
in June 1989. 
  Based on the aforementioned significance of space 
activities, 
this policy says the following three fundamental principles to 
be followed in Japan's space activities: 
<H5>  (1) Response to advancing and diversifying needs </H5>
  As our economy and society progress, needs of society and 
people will become more sophisticated and diverse. Japan must 
execute its space activities in order to enable its space 
development to respond to these needs properly and to create 
efficient systems so that anyone can conduct space activities 
and use space. 
<H3>  (2) Consistency with Japan's role in the international 
society </H3>
  Since space development inherently requires international 
cooperation, Japan, as a member of the international society, is 
expected to make an appropriate contribution consistent with its 
international status. Japan must conduct space activities, 
promoting such international cooperation positively and 
willingly. It is expected of Japan to maintain and improve its 
capabilities to continuously and freely conduct space activities 
which are consistent with its status in the international 
society. 
<H5>  (3) Role of private sector </H5>
  Space development has been conducted primarily by the 
government. With the recent technical developments in this 
field, however, Japan will encourage the private sector to 
obtain sufficient capability considering the proper balance 
between government and private sector's responsibilities. 
<H5>  New Trends in Space Development </H5>
  Following the end of the East-West Cold War era, the world 
is 
now looking for a new international order. The same thing can be 
said in the world of space development. The space development 
policies of the United States and Russia were forced to change. 
The old significance of enhancing the national dignity and of 
supporting military strategies has faded. As a result, advanced 
nations in space development, including the two countries, 
recognize the importance of international cooperation. Now, they 
are cultivating closer international relationships. 
  Today, global issues, such as the earth environment problem, 
which the world faces require global cooperation. The space 
technology that contributes to protection of the earth 
environment, namely earth observation from space, has been 
recognized as a very important activity. Hope for this activity 
is increasing among developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and 
other regions. 
  In Japan, the development of the H-II rocket, with 
international-level launch capability, has progressed, and its 
maiden launch has been set on February 1, next year. 
  Japan also has good prospect in developing large-sized 
satellites. Thus, Japan's space development is steadily 
advancing. Japan now faces the need to establish a future space 
infrastructure as space activities progress. 
  In such new circumstances, Japan must actively promote 
cooperation with advanced countries in developing space taking 
the responsibility for efficient space development in the world. 
She must willingly join the global-scale operations of earth 
observation and other missions to meet the expectation of 
developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and other regions. 
  Furthermore, Japan must make constant efforts to maintain, 
improve and develop her own technology, which is necessary to 
positively and willingly promoting such international 
cooperation and making such international contribution.

<H5>  The Beginnings of Earth Observation </H5>
  The history of earth observation with satellites began with 
mankind's first satellite, Sputnik-1, launched by the former 
USSR in 1957. Following on from this, the United States and the 
former USSR, sent up satellites one after another. 
  Amongst these early satellites, Explorer-6, launched by the 
United States in 1959 was a breakthrough for earth observation. 
It was the first satellite to photograph the Earth from space. 
In the same year, the former USSR used a satellite to photograph 
the dark side of the moon for the first time. 
  The next big leap was to be in 1961, when Vostok-1, the 
first 
manned space ship, was launched by the former USSR. Cosmonaut 
Yuri Gagarin on board this primitive space ship was the first 
man in space, a tremendous step in man's history. 
  Scores of astronauts have since that time had the 
opportunity 
to realize the beauty of the Earth and the frail thinness of the 
layers of Earth's life-supporting atmosphere. Manned satellites 
gave us a new viewpoint of our planet. 
  The first earth observation satellite, LANDSAT-1, was 
launched by the United States in 1972. This was followed by 
another five LANDSATs. Out of these, two, LANDSAT-4 and 
LANDSAT-5, are still in operation. 
  In the latter half of the 1970's, the two superpowers were 
joined by a new face. Japan started earth observation in earnest 
at this time. 
<H5>  Japan's Earth Observation </H5>
  Five years after LANDSAT-1, in 1977, Japan launched a 
geostationary meteorological satellite called Himawari-1. This 
satellite was put in operation and run by the Meteorological 
Agency the following year. 
  In 1978, the Earth Observation Center of the National Space 
Development Agency was established in Saitama Prefecture, north 
of Tokyo. Initially, the center was set up to receive and record 
data from LANDSAT-2 and LANDSAT-3. This function still continues 
to the present day. The data were used to make composite 
photographs of the Japanese landmass and sales of photographs to 
users started. The Earth Observation Center continued to expand 
developing its initial functions until it became the key organ 
for earth observation that it is today. 
  Meanwhile, four satellites in the Himawari series have been 
launched so far. 
  The data from the Himawari satellites are utilized mainly by 
the Meteorological Agency for the prediction of adverse weather 
conditions such as typhoons and heavy rain and snowfall in 
addition to normal weather forecasting. The images taken by 
Himawari appear in TV weather forecasts and weather columns in 
newspapers. TV stations also compose the images and use computer 
graphics to superimpose cloud movements when typhoons approach 
and so on. Such weather information is now a vital part of 
everyday life. 
  The first marine observation satellite Momo-1 was launched 
in 
1987, ten years after the Himawari-1. This was followed by 
Momo-1b, which was mounted with the same observation equipment 
as that of Momo-1, in 1990. The 1b unit has the same orbit as 
Momo-1 and is set at an angle of 180 degrees. 
  The purpose of developing the marine observation satellite 
No. 1 was to establish the basic technology needed to make earth 
observation satellites. This task included development of 
observation equipment to be mounted on the Momo-1, confirmation 
of the functions of the equipment and use of the equipment to 
make experimental observations of the Earth. Momo-1 carries 
three kinds of equipment to observe the following: 
  --Distribution of plants, situation of land utilization, 
geological features, distribution of snow on land, disaster 
prevention, etc. 
  --Water temperature on sea surface, conditions of ocean 
currents, red tide, conditions of water contamination, etc. 
  --Volumeof vapor in atmosphere, ice floes, snow on ground, 
etc. 
  In addition, Momo-1 has a function to collect data from 
buoys 
floating on the ocean and a basic experiment was also carried 
out using this system. 
  After completing its initially scheduled two-year service 
with no malfunction, Momo-1 is still in operation. The satellite 
Momo-1b, as a successor to the Momo-1, is continuing to observe 
the ocean, in particular, and the whole Earth. 
  The most recent in the series is the earth resources 
satellite Fuyo-1, which was launched last year. Fuyo-1 was 
developed in order to evolve observation equipment, including a 
high-performance radar, to confirm the functions of the 
equipment and establish a comprehensive system for earth 
resources observation. 
  Fuyo-1's main purpose is to probe resources, but the 
satellite also serves to survey national land and observe the 
conditions of agriculture, forestry and fisheries and 
environmental preservation, to prevent disasters and to keep a 
watch on coastal waters. 
  The observation equipment on board the Momo-1 is capable of 
checking the undulations and inclinations of land surfaces even 
under rainy conditions and at night. It is also able to observe 
land shapes in three dimensions and distinguish rocks, minerals, 
etc. 
  Japan's earth observation technology is thus shifting from 
an 
experimental stage to a stage of new development, in which the 
technology is widely recognized as effective. It will soon 
become important for Japan to show what she can offer to 
international society. 
<H5>  Future Plans </H5>
  Under development now are the Advanced Earth Observing 
Satellite (ADEOS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). 
  ADEOS is designed to succeed the marine observation 
satellite 
and the earth resources satellite to continue collection of 
data in earth observation. The development of ADEOS is also 
aimed at developing new technology that will be required in 
order to develop future earth observation satellites. 
  A total of eight kinds of observation equipment, of which 
two 
will be supplied by the National Space Development Agency and 
six will be selected from among those offered generally, will be 
mounted on ADEOS. The function of this equipment is to observe 
the marine climate, the ozone layer, etc. 
  The following are the missions for NASDA's two observation 
apparatuses: 
  --Frequent acquisition of data on water color and water 
temperature of oceans and detection of chlorophyll density, 
floating materials and dissolved substances. (These missions 
will give data on the volume of substances produced by marine 
activities, the mechanism of the circulation of carbon dioxide 
gas and conditions for fishing operations.) 
  --Observation of land and coastal waters and surveys of the 
destruction of tropical forests, desertification and water 
contamination. The equipment will also be able to serve in 
surveys of land use and to probe resources. 
  TRMM will make observations on global-scale climatic 
changes, 
such as the El Nino phenomenon and desertification. To solve the 
mystery of climatic changes, it is necessary to make 
comprehensive observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land 
over a long period of time. It is particularly important to 
observe the circulation of water and energy (heat). For this 
reason TRMM will observe rainfall and radiation of heat from the 
ground surface. 
  These observations should be conducted on a global scale, 
but 
special emphasis will be placed on the tropical regions, because 
two-thirds of the rainfall on the earth occurs there. 
  The TRMM project is being jointly promoted by Japan and the 
United States. On this side, NASDA of Japan is to launch the 
satellite with an H-II rocket and to develop radar apparatus for 
rainfall observation, while NASA in the United States is to 
develop the main body of the satellite and the remaining 
observation equipment. The United States is also in charge of 
operating TRMM after its launch, using a data relay satellite. 
  Two further satellites, ADEOS-II and High Resolution 
Observation Satellite, HIROS are under development. They will be 
launched to succeed the above satellites in operation and 
continue to collect data and to improve observation functions. 
ADEOS-II will be launched in 1999 mainly to conduct global-scale 
earth observation as a successor to ADEOS. 
  HIROS will be utilized for map drawing and disaster 
prevention, as it is capable of gathering detailed information. 
Its launch is scheduled for the year 2000. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The technology for earth observation is thus about to enter 
a 
mature stage. The important issue from now will be how to make 
use of it, using the given means. The following are some of the 
expected applications: 
  (i) Use of satellites for weather forecasting and other 
activities which directly affects peoples' daily lives 
  (ii) To serve in national land development, covering 
agriculture, fisheries, urban development, etc., and to probe 
resources 
  (iii) To watch for disasters and enable effective 
countermeasures 
  (iv) To understand what is happening on the Earth and to 
enrich man's fund of useful knowledge 
  (v) To balance the development and preservation of 
environment. To use satellites to find the most effective method 
to solve earth environmental problems, by warning the need to 
curb human activities, etc. 
  It is important today to widen the fields in which satellite 
data are effectively used and to expand the data utilization 
volume. It is necessary to gain a solid recognition of Japan's 
earth observation efforts from not only Japanese people, but 
also from the peoples of the world.

<H5>  Outline of Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX) </H5>
  The Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX) is Japan's first 
chance to conduct a test in which a test vehicle will re-enter 
the atmosphere from earth orbit. The test will be conducted as 
part of a series of flight experiments to develop the H-II 
Orbiting Plane (HOPE). OREX is designed to develop the designing 
and manufacturing technology for a flying object which must 
endure orbital re-entry and to serve the development of HOPE 
with data obtained on aerodynamic force and heating conditions. 
  The OREX test vehicle will be launched with the H-II TF-1 
rocket and, after circling the earth once, will begin to 
re-enter the atmosphere. On the re-entry, the vehicle will 
gather experimental data, transmit the data to the ground and, 
then, splash down in the central Pacific Ocean. OREX is 
scheduled on 1 February 1994. 
  The test project is being conducted in joint research 
between 
the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). 
<H5>  Purposes of OREX Vehicle </H5>
  The aim of OREX is the development of the critical 
technology 
for the re-entry of HOPE into the atmosphere from orbit prior to 
returning to the earth and to obtain the following data 
regarding the re-entry: 
  --Basic data on aerodynamic force and aerodynamic heating 
during re-entry flight. 
  --Basic data on heat resisting structure during re-entry 
flight. 
  --Basic data on the communications blackout phenomenon, in 
which communication is cut out during re-entry. 
  --Basic data on navigation with GPS receiver in re-entry, 
etc. 
<H5>  Test Vehicle </H5>
  The shape of the OREX test vehicle will resemble the front 
part of the HOPE and will have a conic style with an obtuse 
nose. The front face of the test machine, which undergoes severe 
aerodynamic heating at the time of re-entry, consists of 
carbon/carbon material (C/C) and ceramic tiles, both slated to 
be employed on the HOPE, and their heat resisting performance 
will be tested. 
  The C/C nose in the center of the front face has an 
aeroshell 
structure with a diameter of 1.8 meters and a curvature radius 
of 1.35 meters and is one of the largest solid-type noses in the 
world. 
  The test vehicle will carry a guidance control system, a 
communication control system, a propulsion system, a speed 
reduction system and an experiment and measuring system. The 
Drawing of the test vehicle is shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) and 
in the main specifications in Table 1.

<H5>  Flight Plans </H5>
  The test vehicle will be launched with an H-II rocket into a 
circular orbit at an altitude of about 450 kilometers. The 
vehicle will circle the earth once in about one hour and 40 
minutes, when it will apply a reverse jet to pull out of orbit 
within visible range of NASDA's Tanegashima and Ogasawara 
stations. 
  After separation from orbit, the experiment vehicle will 
gradually drop to lower altitudes and re-enter the atmosphere 
over the central Pacific two hours after launch. 



  After the re-entry, the temperature of the test vehicle's 
front face will rise to about 1,570 degrees centigrade by 
aerodynamic heating. The electric waves transmitted from the 
test vehicle will be reflected, dispersed and absorbed by 
electrolytic dissociation air around the vehicle and 
communication with the ground will become impossible. This is 
the communication blackout phenomenon. The vehicle's conditions 
during the blackout will be measured by sensors installed in 
various parts of the vehicle and will be recorded in a data 
memory, an onboard instrument. 



  When the phases of aerodynamic heating and the communication 
blackout end, the test vehicle will convey the data recorded 
during the blackout to vessel and airplane stations waiting near 
its scheduled splashdown area. The vehicle will splash down in 
the central Pacific south of Christmas Island about two hours 
and ten minutes after its launching. 
<H5>  Experiment Plans </H5>
  The OREX test vehicle will gather data between separation 
from the H-II launcher and its splashdown in the Pacific after 
circling the earth. The measured data will be basically 
transmitted in real time. However, communication with the 
receiving stations becomes impossible in some parts of the orbit 
and during the section of the communication blackout. To solve 
this problem, the measured data will be kept in data memory, to 
be retrieved when the electric wave linkage is restored with the 
receiving stations, and then transmitted. 
  The outlines of the experiment and onboard sensors are shown 
in Table 2. 
<H5>  OREX Development Schedule </H5>
  The OREX development schedule is shown in Table 3.

<H5>  Preface </H5>
  Given their relatively short history, science and technology 
have been responsible for social and economic progress, and for 
advances in the standard of living for mankind. However, while 
we have been enjoying this progress, these advances have imposed 
burdens on the Earth, particularly in the degradation of the 
environment and in the depletion of energy and resources. 
  Two decades ago, the Club of Rome proposed, in ``the Limit 
to 
Growth,'' that there should be an overall zero growth to avoid 
the mankind's crisis anticipated in the middle of the 21st 
century and to prevent continued environmental degradation of 
the Earth due to industrial activities. Although its predictions 
about the Earth may be valid, we have been enjoying an affluent 
life. We have thus come to realize, given the aspiration of 
people toward a more affluent life and the orientation of 
developing nation toward modernization, that zero economic 
growth is not practical. 
  At the present, the world population stands at about 5.5 
billion. According to the United Nations' White Paper, this 
population will exceed 10 billion by the year 2050 and will 
continue even further. 
  Should human activities continue to expand, accompanying 
such 
population increase and economic growth, the support system 
provided by the Earth, such an supply of food, resources and 
restoration of nature, may be destroyed. It is thus important to 
control the increase of population, to reduce consumption, and 
to recycle resources. However, I think that we are approaching 
to the point where we cannot overcome the foreseen crisis by 
such passive measures alone. 
  Since the Earth is finite, we must look beyond the Earth to 
the infinity of space, the ``New Frontier,'' with every 
effective means for developing space in order to overcome such 
obstacles and problems and achieve a sustainable development for 
mankind. 
  In the past, Columbus, in his endeavor to locate ``the 
Golden 
Country'' (Japan), discovered a new continent by coincidence. 
Five hundred years later, we, with a firm perception of 
expanding a frontier for human activities, are at the dawn of 
``the Second Age of the Great Voyage.'' 
  The imminent challenge of the present space development in 
the ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' which is also the major topic 
of International Space Year (ISY) 1992. I think that in the 21st 
century we will enter the era of ``Mission from Planet Earth.'' 
When we are going to expand our living sphere beyond the 
confines of the Earth and to pursue new discoveries, it is 
inevitable and natural for space to become our theater. 
  Ever since the launch of Sputnik, space development 
worldwide 
has undergone major advances: varieties of satellite use for 
communication, broadcasting, and Earth observation; man on the 
Moon; planet explorations; manned space activities. With those 
tremendous advances, dreams of mankind have been realized one 
after another. Based on our accomplishment in space hitherto, 
the concept to expand the human frontiers into space might never 
be ``castle in the air.'' 
  In order to explore a new frontier in space for mankind, the 
global scale cooperation is essential. Under reconciliation 
between East and West, we will need to organize a new 
comprehensive mechanism in the 21st century in order to achieve 
our common targets of mankind. We will also need to establish a 
more harmonious system of rule and law. What is most essential, 
however, is to achieve the understanding of people, to raise 
national will, and to establish an international consensus. 
Therefore, it is to say that the key is the resolution of 
mankind to what extent he is willing to make the crucial effort. 
  Hereafter, I will focus on what are technical challenges and 
to what extent they are feasible in order to expand the new 
frontier for human activities. I will not touch upon the topics 
of a new, comprehensive mechanism, or ideas for a system of rule 
and law. 
  Speaking about the future space activities in the 21st 
century, the content and substance differ depending on the time 
horizon. I will define the year 2030, when the current space 
activities will be terminated, as the time horizon that I am 
speaking about. 
<H5>  Man in ``Near Space'' </H5>
  If we expected the frontier of human activities in the 
middle 
of the 21st century, the theater will be limited, at most, to 
our solar system. Furthermore, I don't think that Mercury or 
Venus will become the frontier for mankind by the middle of the 
21st century because their temperatures exceed 400ÎC. It 
would also be impossible to include the planets beyond Jupiter 
in this frontier because it takes more than a thousand days to 
reach from the Earth. Meanwhile, Mars is somewhat under the 
similar environment to that of the Earth--a gravity of 0.38G, 
surface temperature from -140ÎC to 20ÎC, a thin layer of 
atmosphere--and it only takes about 240 days to reach. 
Therefore, Mars can be considered as one frontier for mankind in 
the middle of the 21st century. 
  In the Middle of the 21st century, it is conceivable that 
the 
artificial celestial bodies near the Earth--Space Station, 
spaceport--the Moon and Mars would be the frontier, the area in 
which mankind would be conducting their activities. I will call 
the frontier, encompassing these bodies, ``Near Space.'' 
<H5>  Technological Challenge and Response </H5>
  What technological challenge must be met for mankind to 
advance into ``Near Space?'' What responses are needed to 
overcome such technological challenges? 
<H5>  1. Environment for life in space </H5>

  In ``Near Space,'' the gravity, radiation and thermal 
environments are remarkably different from those on the Earth. 
  Men have stayed in space aboard Mir station for up to one 
year. We have learned that man can return to daily life with 
rehabilitation after staying in space for several days. 
However, such experience does not enable us to fully understand 
the impact that long stays in space will have upon the human 
body. We must, hereafter, demonstrate how long mankind can stay 
in space; assess long-term physical responses to low/micro 
gravity, establish the methods to maintain health in space. The 
method may include providing artificial gravity, physical 
training and rehabilitation after returning to the Earth. If 
these challenges could be resolved through various experiments 
and tests on space stations, humans can stay about one year 
under microgravity on an artificial celestial body, and several 
years under low gravity on the Moon (0.17G) and Mars (0.38G). 
  Theoretically, it's possible to make 1G gravity by rotating 
an artificial celestial body. However, this is economically 
infeasible because its structure and weight become too enormous. 
  As for the radiation environment, man can protect himself by 
the sufficient heavy blocking insulator of water, metals or 
other materials. Thus, the challenge is to develop methods of 
blocking radiation at minimum cost. 
  The thermal environment on an artificial celestial body can 
be easily controlled by the current technology which has been 
applied to most artificial satellites. Control would also be 
feasible if residential areas were constructed underground on 
the Moon and Mars. 
<H5>  2. Oxygen, Water and Food </H5>
  Oxygen, water and food are indispensable commodities for 
man's survival. There are two ways to provide these in ``Near 
Space'': transport from the ground or produce them in space. It 
is simple to transport them from the Earth. However, 
transportation cost becomes too much to support many people 
living in space for long period, it will be imperative to obtain 
materials as much as possible in ``Near Space'' and to recycle 
what is used. 
  Oxygen can be reproduced from exhaled carbon dioxide 
(CO[.sup]2[/]. On an artificial celestial body, oxygen could 
be obtained through the two processes: hydrogen reduction of 
CO[.sup]2[/] to H[.sub]2[/]0, and then electrolysis of 
H[.sup]2[/]0. This technology of oxygen plants has already 
been established on the ground. The future challenges are to 
improve efficiency through improving catalysts, to reduce size, 
and to develop easily maintained systems. 
  In addition, oxygen could be produced from the oxidized 
metals which constitute 42% of the soil of the surface on 
the 
Moon and by using carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/]) which 
constitutes 95% of the atmosphere on Mars. Research and 
development of producing oxygen with similar compound on the 
ground has been initiated. This technology will almost certainly 
be of practical use in the middle of the 21st century. 
  Water can be reproduced by recycling waste hygiene water and 
urine. The technology to recycle water by means of film filter 
and distillation has been under development for Space Station 
``Freedom.'' An advanced system could be utilized by the middle 
21st century. Water can also be produced from lunar soil and 
from the atmosphere or permafrost of Mars. The production 
technology could be of practical use for supplying water in the 
middle of the 21st century. 
  Food is basically supplied by a comprehensive organic 
recycling system which produces and decomposes organic matter. A 
part of this recycling system, with plants only, has already 
been verified on the ground. The challenge is to improve this 
system for use in space. Advanced comprehensive organic 
recycling systems including animals are exceedingly difficult to 
control, so this system will not be realized by the middle of 
the 21st century. Thus astronauts could not enjoy beef, but 
might eat vegetables and artificial meats produced in ``Near 
Space.'' 
<H5>  3. Transportation </H5>
  For the transportation to the Moon or Mars, two-phase-method 
will be probably employed rather than the direct transporting 
method like Apollo program. In this two-phase-method, two 
different types of space vehicles will be developed and used: 
one from ground to the spaceport in low Earth orbit, and from 
spaceport to the Moon or Mars. The advantage of this method is 
that varieties of space transportation systems can be flexibly 
assembled at the spaceport. And thus it is not necessary to 
develop and launch a huge space transportation system from the 
Earth to low Earth orbit. 
  The existing largest launch vehicle has payload capability 
of 
100 ton into low Earth orbit. Development of larger scale launch 
vehicle for the first phase, whose payload capability is 200 to 
300 ton, may be considered economical in the long run because we 
can reduce the amount of launch. For the second phase of the 
transportation from Earth orbit to the Moon, Mars, 
mission-oriented systems will be assembled at the spaceport. 
  If the existing chemical propulsion is to be used, the 
propellant, in particular oxygen, will occupy most of the mass. 
The net mass transported will amount to only one sixth of the 
total mass for the Moon, and only one tenth for Mars. It will, 
therefore, become necessary to produce propellant from resources 
on the Moon and Mars. Higher performance systems such as nuclear 
power must also be sought. 
  The technological challenges for the future transport system 
are summarized in four thrusts: 
  --Developing a large, economical rocket with 200 to 300 ton 
capability to low Earth orbit. 
  --Establishing the technology to assemble large structures 
in 
Earth orbit. 
  --Producing propellant on the Moon and Mars. 
  --Pursuing Nuclear propellant system with safety 
consideration. 
  By the middle of the 21st century, I suppose most of these 
tasks will have been definitely achieved. 
<H5>  Robotics </H5>
  When man advances into ``Near Space,'' robots will play 
important roles. Since robots do not require the same safety and 
life support systems as much as man and they are economically 
advantageous, it is indeed natural to use robots as much as 
possible. Therefore, the extent of activities a man can do will 
depend upon how robots can be developed and used for human 
activities. 
  Robotics will probably have made remarkable progress by the 
middle of the 21st century. Robots will be able to receive 
verbal commands in the language we use in daily life. On 
receiving such commands, robots will be able to think of the 
procedure, to choose the tools and to implement the tasks. When 
a man on the Earth orders a robot on Mars, ``The module has 
something wrong, please repair it,'' the robot will do it. 
  The challenge in robotics is to develop advanced elements 
and 
components: electronics, precision machinery, information 
processing, control systems, and communication systems. Natural 
language comprehension, image recognition, understanding of the 
surrounding environment, selection of the solution and 
operations planning will also be the challenge for robotics. 
These elements and key technologies for robotics are now 
tremendously progressing and will be likely to make the greatest 
progress in the 21st century. 
  After realization of these technical challenges hitherto 
mentioned, mankind will be able to stay for limited periods in 
``Near Space'' by the middle of the 21st century. 
  Regarding man's permanent stay in ``Near Space,'' we need 
further efforts to study the long-term effects of gravity and 
radiation on the human body before we can determine whether 
mankind will be able to live in ``Near Space'' permanently. 
Therefore, I see that the permanent stay in ``Near Space'' will 
still be the big challenge for mankind even in the middle of the 
21st century. 
<H5>  Space Activities in the 21st Century </H5>
  Based on the precious observations, I would like to show you 
my concepts for space activities around the middle of the 21st 
century. 
<H5>  1. On Artificial Celestial Bodies </H5>

  Artificial celestial bodies, such as a spaceport, a space 
factory, solar power satellites, space experiment/observation 
laboratories, will be orbiting around the Earth. For regular 
maintenance of these bodies, service robots will be operating 
around them. 
  A spaceport will be a transfer station for the Moon and 
Mars. 
Propellants, supplies and foods will be brought to the spaceport 
from Earth to the Moon. There they will be loaded on a vehicle 
to be transported to the Moon, to Mars or to other artificial 
celestial bodies. The spacecraft is to dock at the spaceport and 
will be maintained and checked there. 
  In the space factory, materials and pharmaceuticals with the 
highest utility value will have to be produced based upon 
selection of various microgravity experiments. These factories 
will have to be maintained by as few people as possible, and so 
will be highly automated. 
  Energy required for manufacturing and living is to be 
transmitted either by microwave from the solar power satellites 
or from the solar power plants constructed at each space 
factory. Several experiments will be conducted in the space 
laboratory to investigate the long-term effects of low gravity 
upon animals and plants. 
  Short-term living in ``Near Space'' will become easier, and 
eventually tourists will visit for space sight-seeing. 
<H5>  2. On the Moon </H5>
  On the Moon there will be habitation areas, lunarports, 
mining sites, factories, experiment laboratories, and 
observatories. The lunarport, in addition to launching and 
landing facilities of vehicles, will have a mass driver using a 
catapult for cargo transport. 
  After the initial phase of resource exploration, industrial 
mining of resources will have started by this time. A few people 
will be regularly stationed at each mining site. If nuclear 
fusion power plant is operated on the Earth, then mining of 
helium 3 on the lunar surface is probably on a large scale. 
  Some lunar factories, which will be installed after the 
verification of the pilot plant stage, will be operating. A 
limited number of workers and a lot of robots will be working 
there. Products made on the Moon will include oxygen and water, 
structural materials such as bricks, glass, cement, steels, 
aluminum, and other metals. Comprehensive organic recycling 
systems plants will produce bread, vegetables and artificial 
meats. It may be possible by this time to raise chickens and 
fish. 
  There is no atmosphere on the Moon to cause flickering which 
degrades observations from the Earth. The Moon is thus very 
suitable for installation of optical and electrical observatory 
stations. 
  Tourists from the Earth may eventually have vacation on the 
Moon. 
<H5>  3. On Mars </H5>
  An outpost base will be established on Mars in the middle of 
the 21st century. As it takes 240 days to reach Mars, and the 
flight opportunity is once every two years, the whole itinerary 
of one person would take 3 to 5 years. Therefore the personnel 
at this outpost must include doctors, civil engineers, 
architects, experts on the heat environmental control and the 
life support system, and so forth. Over ten people comprising 
various experts and specialists as well as appropriate 
facilities will be required to support the outpost on Mars. 
  At the outpost on Mars, the first stage of the research will 
be completed, and pilot plants will be operating to conduct 
resource explorations, experimentally grow vegetables and breed 
animals, and produce oxygen and water. 
  It is widely recognized that Mars may have been inhabited by 
living creatures. By studying the cause of their extinction from 
Mars, we may get important information about global 
environmental changes. The research in this area will advance on 
Mars. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The primary goal of the space activities in the 21st century 
might be the ``Mission from Planet Earth.'' The concept I 
presented to you is not only my perspectives of the future but 
also reflections on my aspiration and will. As the head of a 
space agency, I should drive forward to realizing the concept 
just mentioned to expand new frontiers into space. 
  As I mentioned earlier, the space development of the 21st 
century is going to be grand project which far exceeds the scale 
of current space activities. It cannot be done solely by one 
country, but rather should be collaborated by joint efforts of 
many countries. Space development in the 21st century is not for 
the national interests of one country alone; it is an 
undertaking for all mankind, and trasncending national borders. 
I hope that this Asia-Pacific ISY Conference in commemoration of 
the International Space Year will give us the momentum to 
further strengthen cooperation among countries worldwide. I wish 
we would go side-by-side and jointly challenge toward the future 
of expanding a frontier for human activities in space.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Japan's long-term recession, considered the worst 
since the end of war, combined with this year's unusually cool 
summer, has substantially slowed down demand for electrical 
power; this is especially true of industrial demands. In terms 
of medium- and long-range growth, however, a steady annual 
growth rate of 2% is predicted. Ensuring the supply 
capacity 
sufficient to meet such a steadily growing energy demand will be 
the biggest problem facing the electric power industry today. 
For this reason, the industry is making every effort to build up 
nuclear power, the type of energy considered ``pivotal'' by the 
industry. The industry also is working on the optimal 
combination (the best mix) of diverse energy sources, including 
hydraulic and thermal power. At new power plant construction 
sites, on which success of electric power companies' effort will 
hinge, difficulties appear to be mounting nationwide. Unless 
something is done to change this situation, a ``power crisis'' 
in the near future will be a real possibility. Deeply concerned 
over the situation, Japanese government, as a part of its 
overall energy policy, has launched a provision of a support 
system designed to appropriate funds even to potential power 
source sites still in early stages and have yet to be designated 
as ``important power source requiring government support.'' We 
have, therefore, decided to investigate existing conditions and 
problems associated with important power sources. Our 
investigation primarily deals with nuclear energy but thermal 
and hydraulic types also are covered when required. Our findings 
will be presented in a series. (9 articles in a series, each 
published on the Friday issue). 
  According to the long-range power development plan 
established by the Electric Power Development Coordination 
Council (Prime Minister's Advisory Council) in July, total power 
demand, except independent power plants, during the next ten 
years beginning in 1993, will register an average of 2.5% 
growth a year. This means that demand will reach 905.6 billion 
kW by the year 2002, registering an increase of approximately 
28% over the total demand recorded for 1992. In order to 
deal 
with this, the council established a goal for starting 
additional power generation operations to achieve an additional 
capacity of 84.52 million kW. 
  Of these, nuclear power plants are aiming for operation of 
approximately 20 reactors generating about 20 million kW. At the 
present time, the total number of commercial nuclear reactors in 
operation is 45 with an output of 37.196 million kW. Its future 
growth, including estimated output from new construction sites, 
however, will be no more than 46 million kW. It is anticipated 
that this will cause a considerable delay in achieving 
development target for the year 2000 (50.5 million kW) 
established in accordance with a long-term energy demand and 
supply estimates of the Advisory Committee for Energy. 
  Because of this, the roles of coal-fired power and liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) in a basic power supply are reexamined. 
Accordingly, electric power companies in succession have begun 
making new plans. Unfortunately, because of environmental 
restrictions imposed on construction of new thermal power 
plants, lead time for starting operations increasingly is 
becoming lengthy. Especially hard hit in this respect are 
nuclear power plant construction sites. 
  Of the ten locations where electric power companies are 
planning to construct new plants, seven of them, namely, 
Ashihama (Mie Prefecture: Chubu Electric Power; Koura (Wakayama 
Prefecture: Kansai Electric Power); Hiokigawa (Wakayama 
Prefecture: Kansai Electric Power); Hiokigawa (Wakayama 
Prefecture: Kansai Electric Power); Kumihama (Kyoto-fu: Kansai 
Electric Power); Kamizeki (Yamaguchi Prefecture: Chugoku 
Electric Power); Namie, Odaka (Fukushima Prefecture: Tohoku 
Electric Power); and Sasu (Ishikawa Prefecture: 3 electric power 
companies, viz., Hokuriku, Chubu, and Kansai Electric Power), 
have yet to obtain the consent of locals after more than 20 
years of negotiations. 
  Especially at Ashihama, where construction was planned in 
1963, faced with the strong opposition of local fishermen, Chubu 
Electric Power ran into a snag. The deadlock still continues, 
now entering the 31st year. On its first nuclear power reactor, 
Shika No.1, Hokuriku Electric Power spent 17 years on the 
``initial stage'', beginning with the selection of a planned 
construction site and ending with the implementation of 
environmental survey with the consent of locals. It took the 
company a total of 26 years before its commercial operations 
began finally at the end of July 1993. 
  Koji Kaibe, head of Construction Site Environment Division, 
The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPCO), attributed 
the difficulties chiefly to the following factors: ``The general 
public does not agree completely that nuclear power generation 
is something which the country must have, and added to the 
deep-rooted distrust and anxiety created by their concept of 
nuclear power itself, it has become increasingly difficult to 
achieve unified opinion among insiders of the Fishermen's 
Cooperative Association.'' 
  As fishing environment deteriorates--partly because of a 
decrease in the number of young people who want to pursue 
fishery--fishermen were split into two groups, a group made up 
of those who wanted to call it quit and those who wanted to 
continue. This affected the amount of compensatory payment 
demanded by fishermen. As the local needs became more 
sophisticated and diversified, subsidies allotted by electric 
power development measure legislated by three laws concerning 
electric power sources, which at one time had been a big 
incentive, has lost its effect. 
  Sensing a crisis situation which a future power shortage 
will 
bring, the government installed in March 1993, Electric Power 
Plant Construction Site Subcommittee under the Electric Power 
Development Coordination Council. Stating that ``the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industries no longer can deal with the 
problem of electric power development alone,'' in addition to 
those extremely knowledgeable in this field, the council 
marshalled bureau-class chiefs from 12 ministries and agencies 
to provided needed support and to promote important electric 
power developments in their initial stages. 
  Moreover, with respect to the country's power source sites 
in 
their initial developmental stages (which are yet to be 
designated as ``important power sources designated for 
development,'') the country is strengthening its support system 
treating them as ``projects which should be supported fully by 
the country.'' At the same time, MITI has launched a substantial 
expansion of power source regional development policy using the 
fund from its 1993 budget. Its attraction is the establishment 
of ``Emergency Subsidy for the Promotion and Establishment of 
Regional Symbiotic-type Nuclear Power Generation Facility.'' In 
the past, the position of an electric power company was 
described as follows: ``In the beginning, there was a power 
plant.'' The concept of regional symbiotic power plant was 
developed in an effort to solve the question of ``how a power 
plant itself can contribute to the well-being of the region 
involved.'' Moreover, the 1994 budgets of both MITI and Science 
and Technology Agency (STA) reflect a substantial expansion of 
their support policies currently being planned. However, since 
electric power companies are the ones directly responsible for 
power development, they should not be wholly dependent on 
government support but rather should actively engage themselves 
in the promotion of regional development, securing understanding 
and support of regional self-governing bodies. 
<H5>  Construction Will Begin at Higashidori in 1998 </H5>
  Aomori Prefecture's Shimokita Peninsula is located at the 
northernmost tip of Honshu. Although it is blessed with abundant 
natural beauty, its winter is extremely severe. Even in 
summertime, it is not free from hazards of a cold weather when a 
Yamase wind, a characteristic of the Pacific Coast, blows down 
from over the mountains for any length of time and reducing the 
number of hours of dry weather. Because of the decline in 
coastal fishery, many seek work away from home, thus 
accelerating the region's depopulation trend. This is about to 
be changed as the region is transformed into Japan's foremost 
nuclear power base. 
  First to emerge is Rokkasho Village where nuclear fuel 
recycling facilities will be constructed. This recycling 
undertaking, which will become Japan's first commercial 
facilities, according to Kiyoshi Nozawa, president of Japan 
Nuclear Fuel, Ltd. (JNF), ``represents a double-edged sword of 
Japan's nuclear policy--development of nuclear power on one hand 
and recycling of plutonium on the other.'' It is a huge project 
in which the electric power industry is pouring its resources, 
investing a total of &yen;1.25 trillion. 
  Inheriting the research result produced by The Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) and purchasing 
from Mutsu Ogawahara Development Co. a land in Rokkasho Village, 
measuring approximately 7.4 million square meters in area, JNF 
launched construction of three types of facilities to deal with 
uranium enrichment, reprocessing, and disposal of low-level 
radioactive wastes. In March 1992, the company began operation 
of its uranium enrichment plant. It plans to make a first 
shipment of product uranium to Tokyo Electric Power sometime 
during 1993. The plant is planning to expand its facility every 
year until its annual production capacity reaches 1,500 tons SWU 
(separated work unit). 
  The low-level radioactive waste disposal center began 
operations in December 1992. The company has decided the final 
scale of storage space to be approximately 
600,000m[.sup]3[/], which is sufficient to store 
approximately 300 200-liter drum cans. In the meantime, it has 
embarked on construction of an intermediate storage facility 
which can handle high-level radioactive wastes returned from 
overseas. Its completion is expected in 1995. Construction of 
the remaining reprocessing plant began in April 1993. The 
company is aiming for the operation of the plant to begin by the 
year 2000. Its maximum processing capacity, when converted into 
the amount of uranium, will be 800 tons a year. Thus the company 
has begun moving toward the establishment of a cycling business. 
Since the new Hosokawa Government's policy is to continue this 
national policy, the problem facing the electric power industry 
is one of ensuring safety of the cycling facility and of finding 
ways in which it can coexist with a regional community involved 
and contribute to revitalization of the region. 
  At a Higashidori Village location, where both Tohoku and 
Tokyo Electric Power companies are planning to construct nuclear 
power plants (boiling light water reactor = BWR) in a vast area 
of approximately 9.1 million square meters (Tokyo Electric Power 
has approximately 4.2 million square meters and Tohoku Electric 
Power, approximately 4.9 million square meters). Since this 
location was selected as a construction site at the invitation 
of locals, Aomori Prefecture took charge of land acquisition 
work with both electric power companies cooperating with the 
prefecture. Although most of land purchase was completed in 
1977, the companies ran into one difficulty after another during 
the course of negotiations with the local fishery industry over 
the matter of compensation. Finally at the end of August 1992, 
an agreement was reached on the compensatory payments to both 
Shiranuka and Odanozawa Fishermen's Cooperative Associations, 
both of which own the fishing right at the frontal sea zone. 
  Subsequently, in June 1993, negotiations on compensation to 
be paid to [Shiriro] and Sarugamori Fishermen's Cooperative 
Associations located in the surrounding area were concluded. 
Once those with the remaining Oibekawa [uchimen] and Kashi 
Fishermen's Cooperative Associations have been concluded, the 
construction plan most likely will have smooth sailing from 
there on. ``Finally, 28 years after the village assembly passed 
the resolution to invite the companies to this region, we have 
the prospect of seeing the preparation for plant construction 
sites begin.'' (Shinnosuke Ohi, head of Higashidori Nuclear 
Power Plant Preparation Office, Tohoku Electric Power). 
  During the first phase, plans call for construction of two 
1.1 million kW capacity reactors by each company. The packaged 
proposal submitted to the Electric Power Development 
Coordination Council shows construction of four reactors on the 
agenda in March 1995. Construction of No.1 reactor will be 
undertaken by each company in 1998. Both companies are planning 
their No. 1 reactors to begin operating by the year 2004. In 
terms of the availability of construction site, this location 
has enough space to accommodate as many as twenty 1 million kW 
reactors. 
  In order to submit a proposal to the Electric Power 
Development Coordination Council, a company involved first must 
obtain agreement from a local community, conduct an 
environmental survey, and complete the first open hearing. When 
the acquisition of a building lot almost has been completed and 
the matter of fishing right ironed out, then a company is said 
to be ready to submit a proposal to the Electric Power 
Development Coordination Council. Of these factors involved, the 
concept of fishing right is quite alien to foreign countries. 
Although it has been recognized from the standpoint of a custom 
in Japan, enactment of Fisheries Act in 1949 (put into effect in 
March 1950) made it a legal right, thereby providing fishermen 
with legal protection. It turned out that this became the 
biggest bottleneck in developing sites of electric energy source. 
  Like most other plans of a similar type, the Electric Source 
Development Co.'s plan to construct a nuclear power plant in 
Ohmamachi, currently in progress, is facing difficulties. The 
nuclear reactor which will be used at Ohma location is a 
validation reactor (6.6 million kW capacity) of the advanced 
thermal reactor (ATR) developed by PNC using domestic 
technology. This is the first nuclear reactor the company has 
developed. The amount of compensation offered by the company in 
September 1992 became a turning point, almost sixteen years 
after the town's Chamber of Commerce and Industry made a move to 
invite the company to the region (in 1976). 
  The amount of compensatory payment offered by the company to 
the local Ohma and Okudo Fishing Cooperatives was &yen;8 
billion, to which &yen;3 billion was added to fund 
revitalization of the local fishery industry, which makes the 
amount of total payment &yen;11 billion. It is unprecedented 
that such a huge sum is offered to compensate fishermen in order 
that a utility company can proceed with the construction of one 
nuclear reactor in the region. In addition, the company is 
offering a complete cooperation to the local government, 
demonstrating how a power plant and a community can work 
together for the benefit of both. At the same time, the local 
government, doing its part, will announce a 10-year development 
plans for the region and fishery industry. A total of &yen;28.4 
billion will be spent on the project. This is the first time 
that the packaging of a development by involving both parties 
has been attempted in Japan. 
  However, with respect to compensatory payments, the amounts 
paid to Ohma-machi and Okudo Fisheries Cooperative Associations 
by Electric Source Development Co. were less than those received 
by Higashidori Fisheries Cooperative when calculated in terms of 
a simple average per member payment. Moreover, the amounts paid 
to Ohma-machi and Okudo Fisheries Cooperative Associations were 
not identical. As a result, many dissatisfied members have 
chosen to block a cooperative's general meeting which would 
decide the fate of the project. In order to break the deadlock, 
both cooperatives requested the town authorities to act as an 
intermediary when they request Electric Source Development Co. 
to increase the amounts of compensation payments. The town 
authorities, in turn, asked the prefecture to act as an 
intermediary, and with this development, the negotiations will 
now enter a new phase. 
  The company already has acquired over 90% of a 
building lot. 
In fact, the company itself intends to respond favorably to the 
cooperative's request, as stated by Tadao Miyamoto, Executive 
Director in charge of Ohma Construction Site Headquarters, 
Nuclear Power Development Headquarters, ``we want to have our 
proposal ready for submission to the Electric Power Development 
Coordination Council so that it can be placed on the agenda 
before the end of this year.'' 
<H5>  Interview with Mr. Hiroyasu Kanazawa, Mayor of Ohma-machi </H5>
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Your reason for inviting 
Electric Source Development Co. to construct a nuclear power 
plant in Ohma-machi and what thus far has taken place? 
  Kanazawa: As a part of regional development plans, 
we wanted to invite a company to establish business here. 
Unfortunately, because our infrastructure, such as roads and 
waterworks, was not up to the standard, we had not been 
successful. We decided then that the appropriate course of 
action would be to invite a large utility company to set up a 
power plant here. Following the adoption of a petition filed in 
1976 with the town assembly, requesting for an environmental 
survey, the town's chamber of commerce and industry in May 1978 
requested Electric Source Development Co. to conduct a land 
survey to determine whether our town could be used to construct 
a power plant. At the end of 1984, the town assembly voted in 
favor of having the company set up a nuclear power plant. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Why have you selected the 
nuclear power industry? 
  Kanazawa: Basically, we wanted to bring into the 
region the state of the art science and do what is best for our 
town, something which really can contribute to regional 
revitalization. Also, we wanted a reputable company to come in 
with a big-scale project. That is why we asked Electric Power 
Development Co., a company closely connected with our region 
through its work in the construction of Hokkaido-Honshu linked 
power transmission lines. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Both here and abroad, it 
increasingly is becoming difficult to acquire nuclear power 
plant construction sites. 
  Nakazawa: There is not a single case of physical 
injury sustained at nuclear power plants in Japan. This supports 
the high scientific standard achieved by the Japanese nuclear 
power industry--the reason why we have a complete trust in 
Electric Power Development Co. We made a point of inspecting 
pilot sites and found this to be the best method of gathering 
vital information. At the same time, we attended a number of 
lectures and study sessions. Because we spent time and effort to 
make ourselves well informed on the fact of nuclear power, the 
local residents, including those in the adjacent Sai and 
Kazemaura Villages, stopped questioning the safety of nuclear 
power. The Shimokita Peninsula will become one of the foremost 
nuclear power bases in Japan. We very much wish to utilize this 
opportunity as a braking mechanism--a device to be used in 
halting the regional depopulation trend while, at the same time, 
creating jobs and working toward achieving higher earnings for 
the residents, as well as their well being. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: In September 1992, when the 
town authorities announced the amounts of compensation payments 
offered to local fisheries cooperatives by Electric Power 
Development Company, didn't they also reveal their plans for 
revitalization of fishing industry and the region? 
  Kanazawa: In order to achieve an amicable 
settlement, we presented fisheries and regional development 
plans to be packaged with compensation payments Electric Power 
Development Co. offered to the fisheries cooperatives. The 
company, in total agreement with our approach, is formulating a 
policy of cooperation with us. It appears that Electric Power 
Development Co. also is working hard at the development of 
[three other towns and villages] to achieve a regional symbiotic 
type power plants. We are very grateful for their efforts. I 
have no special requests to make of Electric Power Development 
Co., the country, or the prefecture. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: By the way, the problem of 
compensation to the fisheries cooperatives still is far from 
being resolved, isn't it? Do you expect it to be solved any time 
soon? 
  Kanazawa: Although the fisheries cooperatives want 
the construction to begin as soon as possible, they were not 
happy with the figures presented to them. So they approached us, 
requesting that we act as an intermediary in negotiating for 
more money. We, in turn, asked the prefecture to mediate. Since 
Electric Power Development Co. expressed its willingness to 
offer more money, we hope that the matter will be settled soon. 
Decline in coastal fishery, including that of kelp, is 
accelerating the pace of economic downward trend in our region, 
which in turn drives our young workers to leave the region, 
seeking employment elsewhere. This has been creating a serious 
problem of shortage of successors. That is why we want to start 
working on fishery (improving coastal fishery) and regional 
development as soon as possible.

  [Text] Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant occupies a site in the 
world's most fertile fishing grounds, namely, Miyagi 
Prefecture's Onagawa-machi and Ojika-machi located in the 
eastern central part of the Minami Sanriku and Ojika Peninsulas. 
Geographically, it is positioned in the center of Tohoku Region 
facing the Pacific. It has been 10 years since Onagawa nuclear 
plant's Reactor No. 1 (520,000kW) began its operations. Reactor 
No. 2 (825,000kW) currently under construction is in its final 
stage, with its operations expected to begin July 1995. It will 
be followed by Reactor No. 3 (825,000kW) whose construction is 
scheduled to commence in November 1996. Thus the expansion of 
the plant facility will be carried out rapidly in succession. By 
the year 2002, when Reactor No.3 begins its operations, the 
total output of the plant will reach 2.174 million kW. The plant 
by then will be poised to play a central role in satisfying 
energy demand of the 21st century for Tohoku Electric Power. 
  Tohoku Electric Power's first ``nuclear light,'' Onagawa 
Nuclear Reactor No. 1 (Boiling-Light-Water-type Reactor=BWR) at 
present is supplying approximately 30% of electricity 
used in 
Miyagi Prefecture. Reactor No.2, whose construction began in 
August 1988, also is a BWR. It is almost 85% completed. A 
building, which houses the main unit of the No.2 reactor, has 3 
floors both above the ground and in the basement situated in the 
center of the building. It also has a nuclear reactor wing 
measuring approximately 66 meters by 55 meters in area; 
surrounding the wing is a two-story reinforced concrete annex 
building with a 3-story basement. The No.2 reactor power plant 
consists of three buildings, with the nuclear reactor building 
in the center, flanked by turbine and control buildings. 
  In addition to the main nuclear reactor unit consisting of 
fuel and internal reactor structural elements and a nuclear 
reactor pressure vessel, the main system has a nuclear reactor 
cooling system centering around a recirculation-main steam 
system and a reactor core cooling system for emergency use. A 
turbine power generating facility is equipped with condensation 
and water-feeding systems, including a water circulation system 
designed to circulate main condenser's cooling water. 
  Reactor No.2 has new features which are not offered in 
Reactor No. 1. For instance, in comparison with a flask-type 
containment vessel, the ``[marku] type,'' used in Reactor No. 1, 
the ``improved [marku] type'' allows sufficient space for 
carrying out work. This is designed to improve operational 
efficiency in conducting routine inspections inside the 
containment vessel. 
  The condensate filter has been changed from the 
pressure-precoat type to the hollow-fiber-membrane type. When 
finished with the rotation of a turbine, steam will be cooled 
inside the main condenser and become condensate. The condensate 
filter, designed to remove the rust and other iron content 
cleanly and to prevent nuclear reactor cooling water from 
becoming radioactive. The pressure precoating method uses resin 
as an auxiliary filtering agent. The hollow fiber membrane 
method employed in Reactor No.2, on the other hand, does not use 
resin. This means that the hollow fiber membrane can be burned, 
thus drastically reducing the amount of radioactive wastes 
generated. Moreover, in order to improve thermal efficiency of 
the turbine, a ``free moisture separation heating method'' has 
been employed in Reactor No. 2. This method is designed to 
eliminate steam moisture with a moisture separator, while the 
moisture to be sent to a low-pressure turbine using a part of 
high-temperature steam, is being heated. This is just one 
example of the new technologies incorporated into Reactor No. 2. 
  In July 1995, when Reactor No. 2 begins commercial 
operations, approximately 75% of electric power used in 
Miyagi 
Prefecture will have been supplied by Reactors Nos. 1 and 2. 
  As for the additional installation of Reactor No. 3 (BWR), 
Tohoku Electric Power added this item to its 1993 facility plans 
and submitted an ``environmental impact survey document'' to 
MITI on 18 August. Having gone through informational meetings 
and a walk-through of the site, the company plans to hold the 
first official hearing on the first phase of the construction 
and to incorporate the basic power development plans of the 
second phase before the end of 1993. The company hopes to have 
the proposal put on the agenda of Electric Power Development 
Coordination Council, the prime minister's advisory organ, by 
the spring of 1994. 
  In terms of the composition of the electric power source 
(volume of power generation), Tohoku Electric Power's 1992 
record shows that the ratio of nuclear power was no more than 
20%. In 1997, when No.2 reactor will be in full 
operation, the 
ratio will be increased to 24%, and by the year 2002, 
when No. 
3 reactor will be used in commercial operations, the ratio will 
rise to 26%. This means that nuclear power can be 
regarded as 
the base electric source. By enlarging the role played by the 
nuclear power, the company will be ``opening up electric 
sources.'' 
<H5>  Spend Time on Study Meeting </H5>
  As indicated by what thus far transpired at Onagawa nuclear 
construction site, Tohoku Electric Power spent 12 years from the 
time when the town had decided to invite the company to the 
region, to the beginning of the construction. However, once the 
construction had begun, it took both Onagawa and Ojika Town 
Assemblies only 2 years and 9 months to vote in favor of 
accelerating further buildup of nuclear power facilities. In the 
case of Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, there was a clear 
difference in the willingness of the local community to accept 
the project during the first half(when construction of Reactor 
No. 1 was pursued) and the second half(when development of 
Reactors Nos. 2 and 3 are being pushed). 
  Onagawa-machi even today is a ``fishing village,'' which, in 
terms of quantities of fish unloaded here, ranks fifth in Japan. 
Before the construction of Reactor No. 1 was undertaken, 
fishermen put up strong resistance to the nuclear power project. 
``This was what delayed starting of plant construction by more 
than 10 years.'' (Zenjiro Suda, town manager of Onagawa-machi). 
However, a great deal of time spent to keep dialogue going 
between the company and fishermen, as well as study sessions, 
served to dispel residents' fear of nuclear power, enabling them 
to grasp the fact that nuclear energy can serve as a foundation 
for the development of fisheries and other regional industry. 
Once they understood this, the nuclear power project progressed 
rapidly. 
  There is no question about the benefit brought to Onagawa by 
the nuclear power plant--it is considerable. The amount of 
subsidy received by the town under the provision of the three 
power-development-related laws, beginning with Reactor No. 1 and 
ending with trial calculations made in connection with Reactor 
No. 3 is approximately &yen;20.2 billion. The municipal property 
tax (city, town, and village taxes; a trial balance at 
Onagawa-machi) is approximately 88 billion, and the nuclear fuel 
tax for Reactor No. 1 recorded up to now is approximately 
&yen;3.8 billion. Moreover, according to the record of purchase 
orders sent to local and surrounding areas in connection with 
Reactor No. 1 is approximately &yen;43.2 billion and for Reactor 
No. 2, it reaches approximately &yen;32.1 billion. 
  In order to give the benefit generated by the construction 
site back to the local community in an equitable manner, 
Onagawa-machi organized and operates ``Onagawa Commerce and 
Industrial Enterprise Cooperative (230 members).'' In ordering 
goods, including daily necessities, the company opted to use the 
cooperative as a window. This method is but one example through 
which effective cooperation is achieved between the region and 
the company in pursuing nuclear power development. 
<H3>  Two Projects Planned Following Onagawa and Higashidori 
Projects </H3>
  As has been described, Onagawa nuclear power development is 
accelerating its pace of expansion. However, in addition to 
Onagawa and Higashidori, Tohoku Electric Power has plans for two 
more nuclear power development sites still pending. 
  Of these, the site located at Namie-Kodaka (Fukushima 
Prefecture) was voted in by the town assembly. This took place 
26 years ago; since then, however, no significant progress has 
been made. As for the other development at Maki (Niigata 
Prefecture). although the problem of compensation to the area's 
fishing industry has been resolved completely and the proposal 
was approved by the Electric Power Development Coordination 
Council in November 1982, there still remains the problem of 
private land to be resolved. However, recently, Maki Town 
Assembly adopted a ``statement of an opinion on having 
development project started as soon as possible,'' indicating 
that the town is ready to make a new move. In order to begin 
operations (825,000kW) by the year 2002, the company is 
developing a policy formulated to create close contact with the 
region. This project will become an electric power supply point 
following the Onagawa nuclear power plant. 
<H5>  Interview with Mr. Zensaburo Suda, Mayor of Onagawa-machi </H5>
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It was September of 1967 
when both Onagawa and Ojika Town Assemblies made resolutions to 
bring Tohoku Electric Power into your region to build nuclear 
power plants, wasn't it? 
  Suda: Although Southern Sanriku was Japan's 
foremost fishing ground, since the mid-60s, the region's fishing 
industry has been declining. It was back then that my 
predecessor began to use the word, a setting sun, to describe 
the state of our fishing industry. Certainly, there were a 
number of things which appeared to indicate that indeed we were 
heading in that direction. We began to hear about the 
prohibition of whaling; also Nippon Suisan had pulled out its 
entire operation from this region. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Then in December of 1979 
that full-scale construction of Reactor No.1 began. 
  Suda: Beginning in 1975, the 200-mile limit was 
imposed on fishermen, which pushed the fishing industry to the 
brink of collapse. This factor was directly responsible for our 
decision to pursue the plan for nuclear power development. For 
local residents, construction at Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant 
site ultimately meant the revitalization of the region. How 
Japan is going to secure energy is an extremely important 
question. Who are going to be responsible for securing it and 
how will this be accomplished? We believe that Tohoku as a 
region is obligated to do its part. It must take on this 
responsibility. Would it be possible for us to provide a site 
for power development, and, at the same time, link this to our 
regional development plans? All of us gave this matter a serious 
consideration. 
  However, initially, some residents were reluctant. Since our 
town is a center of the fishing zone, fishermen put up a strong 
resistance. The voices of pros and cons whirled around us, each 
side fighting hard for its cause. It was a good thing we spent a 
great deal of time talking the matter over, until finally every 
one had a clear understanding of what the nuclear power 
development had to offer to the community. We used the means of 
persuasion and explanation. Because of what both sides learned 
in the process, we have chosen the course of action which is 
working well for the community today. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Recently, a theme of 
``establishing symbiotic relationship with the region'' is 
emphasized by those constructing plants. 
  Suda: Looking back, we feel that from the very 
beginning, our approach was symbiotic. Our role as an energy 
supply base was compatible with local industry and fisheries. 
This indeed must be an equal symbiotic relationship. No problem 
exists between the company and our community. The company and 
their affiliates are making every effort to be a part of the 
region by participating town's social work and social circles 
and they are succeeding. When necessary, I do not hesitate to 
speak up, and the other side does the same. This is what 
symbiosis is all about. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about Three Laws 
concerning the development of power source? 
  Suda: I feel that it would be better if some 
restrictions are imposed on them. The present national Three-Law 
system is too narrow. Although I have no intention of making a 
request outside the legal framework, since industrial structure 
and geographical conditions differ from region to region, the 
Three Laws must be able to accommodate these differences. 
Otherwise, it will be meaningless. It is nice that the Three 
Laws pay for costs of construction, but the constructed building 
must be maintained, and it costs money to do this. We will be 
very grateful if Three Laws takes into consideration operational 
and maintenance expenditures as well. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It will be the 21st century 
(2002) when Reactor No. 3 becomes operative. What kind of 
buildup plans does do you have for the town? 
  Suda: Our town has only sea and mountains. 
Although the local fishing industry has recovered from slump 
through the conversion to ``producing industry,'' it is 
dangerous to solely rely on fisheries. On the other hand, even 
if we want to invite businesses to this region, we don't have 
any land to build on. So we are considering the type of work in 
the information-oriented field. Using the energy supply base as 
a foundation, we want to combine our coastal fishing industry 
with tourism. Also under consideration is the use of the town as 
an information dispatch base. The communication industry will 
appeal to young people, and so we can make them settle down in 
this town. 
  With respect to the information industry, 11 companies, 
consisting of those in the surrounding cities and towns and 
power-source-related companies, joined forces and established a 
third-sector information service firm, ``Otech.'' We want to 
show the world that in spite of the disadvantageous conditions 
in which the town finds itself, we can still be innovative, 
creating something new and worthwhile. 
  NIKKAN SANGYO KOGYO: Looks like this will 
accelerate your efforts to create ``a new town,'' doesn't it? 
  Suda: Our decision to offer our town for 
development of nuclear power has substantially increased the 
town's source of revenues. Other improvements are less tangible 
but they are there. The most significant improvement is the way 
in which residents now approach problems. Young people have 
begun to devote their efforts to build an attractive town. This 
indeed is the best thing that has happened to the town since the 
nuclear power development project began. Viewed from a total 
perspective, this is what symbiotic relationship between the 
town and the outside business firm has produced.

  [Text] Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Kashiwazaki Kariba 
Nuclear Power Plant (Kariba Village-Kashiwazaki City, Niigata 
Prefecture) will have become the world's biggest and newest 
nuclear power plant by July 1997 when its Reactor No. 7 begins 
operations. At present, Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) Nos. 1,2,3 
5 (1.1 million kW, each) are in operation. Under construction at 
present are BWR No. 4 (1.1 million kW) and the advanced BWR 
(ABWR) Nos. 6 and 7 (each 1.356 million kW). The combined output 
of these 7 reactors, amounting to 8.212 million kW, is the 
largest in the world. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-50A>           Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant Positional Diagram </FIG>




  No matter where you look, here or abroad, it would be 
difficult to find another power plant which is adding three more 
nuclear reactors. Japan's Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power 
Plant, moreover, will become the world's first ABWR power plant. 
The energy source development plays a central role in Japan's 
energy policy. For a long time, the light water reactor is 
expected to become the ``main stream.'' At the same time, 
advancement of light water reactor technology is being pursued. 
Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant, therefore, will become a 
great nuclear power base satisfying those demands. 
  At Kashiwazaki-Kariba plant, Reactor No. 3 began operating 
on 
11 August 1993. The total output of the plant now equals to that 
of Fukushima Second Nuclear Power Plant, viz., 4.4 million kW. 
Moreover, at this point, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power 
facilities, equipped with 14 reactors, are generating 13.4198 
million kW. This output represents approximately 27% of 
the 
total power generation facilities. 
  Of the power generation facilities currently under 
construction, Reactor No. 4, whose construction began in 
February 1988, achieved an overall progress rate of 95.3% 
at 
the end of September 1993. The loading of fuels began on 7 
October. Its commercial operations will begin in July 1994. 
  Reactors Nos. 3 and 4 are attracting attention as the 
world's 
first ABWR, an advanced version of BWR featuring improved 
safety, reliability, operationality, and work ratio. 
Construction of Reactor No. 6 began in September 1991 and that 
of Reactor No. 7 in February 1992. Their progress rates at the 
end of September are 48.3% and 20.8%, 
respectively. For 
Reactor No. 6, fitting of steel plate lining of a reactor 
containment vessel made of reinforced concrete almost has been 
completed. Its pressure vessel will be installed in September 
1994. For Reactor No. 7, a base mat construction, which is a 
basic construction on a base rock, will be completed some time 
in October; a pressure vessel will be installed in June 1995. 
Reactor No. 6 will start operating commercially in December 
1996, and Reactor No. 7 in July 1997. 
  The foremost characteristic of ABWR is that a nuclear 
reactor 
recirculation pump, designed to circulate water within the 
reactor, which has been installed outside the reactor pressure 
vessel, will be replaced by the ``pressure vessel internal 
pump.'' This has made it possible to reduce the number of pipes 
arranged within a recirculation system. Consequently, in an 
emergency situation, a reactor core will not be exposed; 
moreover, since the sizes of reactor containment vessel and 
reactor housing can be reduced, construction cost also can be 
lowered.

  Furthermore, many next-generation technologies are employed 
in constructing ABWR. For instance, use of an integral 
construction in the reinforced concrete reactor containment 
vessel and reactor housing increased their resistance to 
vibration. Moreover, multiple functions equipped with, in 
addition to hydraulic pressure drive, an electric motor drive 
designed to work at slow pace as well, is used in a control rod 
drive system. 
  Tokyo Electric Power ordered main power generation units 
(nuclear reactor, turbine, and generator), constituting the 
two-thirds of total construction costs of Reactor Nos. 6 and 7, 
from the International Joint Venture (JV), a joint venture of 
General Electric (GE), Toshiba, and Hitachi. Of these, the 
amount of order received by GE is approximately one-third, or 
approximately 1.4 billion dollars (approximately &yen;190 
billion; each unit, approximately &yen;95 billion). Construction 
of ABWR, therefore, contributes to reducing Japan's trade 
surplus against the United States. 
<H5>  In Process of Transforation into Software Base </H5>
  Total construction cost of Reactors Nos. 1-7 reaches 
&yen;2.6256 trillion. At the point when Reactor No. 7 will 
become operational, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power 
generation facilities will have had a total of 17 reactors, 
generating 17.38 million kW all together. The total nuclear 
power output will constitute 30.8% of the company's entire 
power generation facilities, including hydraulic and thermal 
power plants. This clearly indicates the importance of 
Kashiwazaki-Kariba as a source of power. Its secondary effects 
on Niigata Prefecture's economy, including its regional 
development plan, also are spreading. 
  The amount of subsidy received under Three Laws concerning 
Power Source Development is approximately &yen;76.1 billion. Of 
this amount, Kashiwazaki City, the site of plant construction, 
received approximately &yen;24.2 billion and Kariba, 
approximately &yen;21.5 billion. At the end of August, the 
number of those employed was 2,088 in Kashiwazaki City and 299 
in Kariba. When these numbers are combined with those in other 
regions of the prefecture, the total is 4,209. 
  The most noticeable change brought about by the construction 
of the nuclear power plants at Kashiwazaki-Kariba most likely is 
an increase in local population. 
  To begin with, Kashiwazaki City, considered the cradle of 
the 
petroleum industry, is the locality whose economy is deeply 
rooted in energy. Even today, its production of natural gas, 
with the annual output of 370 million km[.sup]3[/], 
constitute approximately 17.3% of the national output. 
However, 
``from 1955 to 1970, its source of revenues were depleted 
because we did not have the key industry. With a large number of 
people either leaving or seeking seasonal work elsewhere, the 
problem of depopulation became accurate. We realized that we had 
to take action.'' (Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki 
City). 
  In fact, in 1969, at the time the city voted for the nuclear 
power plant construction, the size of its population was no more 
than 80,000. Today, thanks to the nuclear power plant, our city 
is one of those cities whose population has reached the 90,000 
mark. In the case of Kashiwazaki City, the adoption of the 
policy to spend revenues generated by the Kashiwazaki-Kariba 
project in developing human resources and employment 
opportunities has paid off in the ``creation of a city with 
charm.'' The regional development policy played a nucleus role 
in this undertaking. 
  Kashiwazaki City, which has been successful in persuading 
two 
four-year universities to relocate to the city, currently is 
devoting its effort in building a ``software base.'' In order to 
vitalize the region through use of advanced information 
technology, a ground for facility installation for use in 
training of information personnel and in bringing the software 
industry to the city has been prepared. What the city envisions 
are to create jobs for young people and to establish the 
information industry in the region. Guided by the ``concept of 
high-vision community,'' the city is moving toward the creation 
of a software base, integrating industrial and academic 
endeavors centering around imaging information technology. 
  At that juncture, Kashiwazaki City, will emerge as an 
information city as well, this being done while maintaining its 
role as an energy supply base, which is founded on regional 
development. 
<H5>  Interview with Mr. Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki </H5>
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your opinion 
concerning subsidies granted under Three Laws concerning power 
source development? 
  Nishikawa: In the case of Kashiwazaki City, a 
subsidy granted under Three Laws concerning power source 
development will be terminated soon. So the game is over insofar 
as we are concerned. My feeling about Three Laws is that there 
should be more flexibility. I am mentioning this for the benefit 
of those regions which will be involved in power development 
projects. However, in reality, these restrictions do not have 
severe crippling effects. Even if restrictions exist, delay in 
organizing a foundation does not leave one without a menu of 
work to choose from. We simplified the matter by thinking that 
all we had to do under the circumstance was to concentrate on 
the basics for the previous stage. 
  NIKKO KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about the fixed asset 
tax? 
  Nishikawa: The most important thing insofar as 
city finance is concerned is to secure a constant source of 
revenues. As you know, Three Laws grants a subsidy whenever a 
company undertakes the construction of a new reactor, but that 
is as far as it goes. Afterward, we have to deal with 
depreciation assets tax. However, the tax will go down as the 
assets depreciate. Since it is not constant, the headache 
associated with it is not uniquely Kashiwazaki but applicable to 
all other cities, towns, and villages, as well, where part of 
their lands are marked off for construction of nuclear power 
plants. We don't believe that we should spend the entire amount 
of subsidies received simply because it is made available to us. 
We are, therefore, searching for ways in which the money can be 
made useful to succeeding generations. 
  Fifteen years is the term of repayment of a loan on nuclear 
power facilities, but the actual work continues much longer. Our 
association with the nuclear power plant also will continue. 
Since our source of revenues will dwindle over the years, while 
stretching the depreciable assets, we should take a step to find 
a new steady source of revenues--these are the things which we 
wish to see achieved, although we do realize that legislating a 
new taxation will be difficult. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: More specifically-- 
  Nishikawa: At present, a nuclear fuel tax is 
granted to the prefecture. Since this tax will be imposed on 
fuel loading as long as nuclear power is at work, it is a 
semi-permanent source of revenues. Especially in the case of 
Kashiwazaki-Kariba, the tax amount involved when all seven 
reactors become operative will be huge. In order to see that a 
certain percentage of the tax will be allocated to regional 
cities, towns, and villages, where part of lands are used for 
constructing nuclear power plants, we will request not only 
national guidelines but prefecture's actions as well. Moreover, 
a preferential measure has a proviso stating ``limited to future 
additions or new construction sites.'' This is contrary to 
what the country said previously. We are urging the prefecture 
not to forget the hard work put in by those connected with 
earlier nuclear power plant construction sties. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you tell me something 
about the disaster prevention measure from the local viewpoint? 
  Nishikawa: We want the national government to 
provide guidelines which are a little more structured and 
centralized. We like to see the Ministry of Home Affairs, MITI, 
and Science and Technology Agency come together in dealing with 
the problem of nuclear disaster prevention. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you talk on the 
secondary effects of nuclear power plant on Kashiwazaki-Kariba 
residents? 
  Nishikawa: At present, the plants employ 2,900 
locals. These are stable jobs in terms of future as well. The 
total amount invested was &yen;2.6 trillion. The fact that such 
a huge amount of money was brought into our region certainly is 
a big plus. For instance, in 1972, only 20% of our 
high-school 
graduates settled in Kashiwazaki. Today, this figure has risen 
to over 50%. This is brought about not only by Tokyo 
Electric 
Power but also by the development of various facilities which, 
in turn, can be attributed to power plants built in this region. 
In the field of educational undertaking, we have been successful 
to have two four-year universities relocate to this region. 
Moreover, in 1990, the region was designated as a high-vision 
community model region. Currently, our major effort goes into 
developing software industry in which imaging plays a central 
role. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Your picture of the future 
of Kashiwazaki and nuclear power? 
  Nishikawa: Currently, we are developing three 
reactors. Kashiwazaki and Tokyo Electric Power are like a 
married couple raising children. The construction work give us a 
feeling of climbing a hill, which we rather enjoy. However, once 
our role in child rearing is finished, we believe that there 
will be a stringent demand--unlike any we thus far have 
experienced--placed on both sides. How does Tokyo Electric Power 
feel about being in this region ten, twenty years from now? Do 
they find it meaningful? I am not talking about money or 
material things. We want to make serious effort in thinking out 
this type of problem. I hope that the company will do the same. 
<H5>  BTC Niigata Center </H5>
  An operator training firm for BWR Nuclear Power Plant, the 
BWR Operation Training Center (BTC, 651 Fuzawa Aza Chuodai, 
Okuma-machi, Futaba-gun, Fukushima Prefecture. President: Mr. 
Yuhiro Mizuno), invested a total of &yen;5 billion to construct 
the second training base, ``BTR Niigata Center,'' (a building 
area: 5,600m[.sup]2[/]) in Kariba Village. Training already 
has begun at the center. 
  Six companies which are using BWR consists of [Japan Nuclear 
Power Generation Co.], and Tohoku, Tokyo, Chubu, Hokuriku, and 
Chugoku Electric Power Companies. The BTC Niigata Center will 
deal with the need for improved operational safety and stability 
created by the addition of nuclear power facility sites on the 
Japan Sea Coast, such as Kashiwazaki-Kariba. 
  The center's main facility consist of a 1.1 million kW class 
simulation model of Reactor No. 4 used in operational training, 
viz., Simulator No. 4, and computer-assisted instruction (CAI) 
units. The center can train two 4-member teams a day. The 
simulator is an exact model of the power plant's central control 
panel. Training with the simulator provides trainees with the 
feeling of working with the actual equipment. In addition to 
routine plant operations, such as start and stop, through use of 
hypothetical accidents, training in handling of emergency 
situations can be repeated as frequently as required. 
  The center will install an ABWR operational training 
simulator in the summer of 1994. With this installed facility, 
the center looks ahead to the need which must be filled when 
Reactors Nos. 6 and 7 begin operating. Before the actual 
equipment becomes operative, therefore, the center wants to see 
that it has well-trained ABWR operators ready to go when the 
time comes.

  [Text] Shika Nuclear Power Plant's Reactor No. 1 
(Shika-machi, Hakui-gun, Ishikawa prefecture. Boiling Water 
Reactor=BWR, output= 540,000kW), which began commercial 
operations at the end of July is the 43rd (22nd in terms of BWR) 
commercial nuclear power generation facility. For Hokuriku 
Electric Power, however, it represents the company's first 
effort in nuclear power generation. Moreover, of all domestic 
nuclear power plants, it is the only reactor construction site 
whose first reactor entered the commercial operational stage in 
the 1990s. At the same time, with the operation of this reactor, 
Japan's nuclear power setup, commemorating its 30th year, has 
added a new distinction, in that all 9 electric power companies 
now have nuclear power generation capabilities. Hokuriku 
Electric Power has submitted a proposal for construction of 
Reactor No. 2, a 1.35 million kW-class improved version of BWR 
(ABWR). The company is targeting 2005 as the year which will see 
the commercial operation of this reactor. 
<H3>  Reactor No. 1, the Only Reactor To Begin Commercial 
Operation in 90's </H3>
  It has been 30 years since [Nippon Genshiryoku Hatsuden] 
first succeeded in nuclear power generation on 26 October 1963. 
In October 1993, Japan's nuclear power industry will commemorate 
the 30th anniversary. Although, of 9 electric power companies, 
Shika Nuclear Power Plant is the last to become a commercial 
nuclear power plant, it was in November 1967 that Hokuriku 
Electric Power first announced its plan to construct this 
Reactor No. 1. Although the plan itself was conceived quite 
early, the company had to spend ensuing 26 years battling with 
local residents before the reactor can be built and become ready 
for operation. 
  It took 17 years in the first phase of the development plan, 
beginning with preliminary surveys, including an environmental 
impact survey, and ending with the agreement obtained from the 
locals. It required only 4 years and 8 months for Hokuriku 
Electric Power to start construction and bring the project to 
conclusion with the commercial operation of Shika Power Plant. 
Stalemates and difficult negotiations involving the local 
community caused undue prolongation of preliminary survey 
period. In fact, these factors are causing serious problems not 
only at Shika site but at all other development sites as well. 
  As a matter of fact, seven development sites throughout 
Japan, whose development plans involving the initial reactor 
have been pending in the preliminary survey stage for over 20 
years, waiting for negotiation settlements with locals. 
Moreover, under the present conditions, not even one development 
plan can be brought to the operational stage before the year 
2000. 
  As touched upon previously, such a situation has elevated 
the 
position of Shika Nuclear Power Plant's Reactor No.1 as the only 
first reactor to emerge in the 1990's. This reactor's output of 
540,000kW is small from the present standard. However, looking 
back, from the beginning until it became operational 
commercially, its significance in the history of Japan's nuclear 
power industry cannot be ignored. 
  The total construction cost of Reactor No. 1 is 
approximately 
&yen;290 billion. Placing a premium on safety and reliability, 
the company aggressively introduced new BWR technologies and 
operating know-how employed by other companies which have BWR 
plants. The reactor's body diameter is 20 meters and height 35m. 
Use of an advanced MARK-I type containment vessel, designed to 
increase the vessel's volume 1.6 times that of the conventional 
MARK-I; of CRT in monitoring which is a focal point of the 
reactor's central control panel; of improved 8 x 8 fuel; and of 
a glass-cement solidification method, highly effective in 
reducing the volume of radioactive wastes;--these are some of 
the examples of new technologies incorporated into the Reactor 
No. 1. 
  From the standpoint of environmental protection, a 
breakwater 
was built in a straight line parallel to the coast. This has 
minimized change in tidal currents. Also, in order to preserve 
natural beauty of the coast, a landing place is constructed 
using a [Dejima] method, and for water intake/discharge 
channels, an undersea tunnel was built so that the shoreline in 
front of the power plant can be protected. 
  When 540,000kW power generated by Shika Nuclear Power Plant 
is added to the company's hydraulic power output of 1.86 million 
kW and thermal power output of 2.662 million kW, the total 
supply capacity of Hokuriku Electric Power has risen to 5.8 
million kW. 
  Since hydraulic power played a central role in the company's 
operation in the beginning, of the nine electric utility 
companies, Hokuriku Electric Power has the largest ratio of 
hydraulic power (in the current composition ratio, it is 
29%). 
Subsequently, thermal power became the main source of supply, 
which has been extended to Shika Nuclear Power Plant 
(15%). 
From hydraulic power to thermal power and then to nuclear 
power--such diversification in the source of power is a course 
of action taken by all electric power companies in Japan, and 
the most typical example of this can be seen in Hokuriku 
Electric Power Co. 
  In the case of Hokuriku Electric Power , it is expected that 
the maximum power output of 4.55 million kW recorded for 1992 
will climb to 6.27 million kW for the year 2006. For this 
reason, the company has undertaken construction of Nanao Ohta 
Thermal Equipment No. 1 (500,000 kW; operation to begin in 
December 1994), Equipment No. 2 (700,000 kW; operation to begin 
in 2000), and Tsuruga Thermal Equipment No. 2 (700,000kW; 
operation to begin in 2000). However, capability margin, showing 
a balance of demand and supply, will have been reduced to 
approximately 3% by the year 2006. This means that a new 
power 
source will be required. 
  Shika Nuclear Reactor No. 2, a 1.35 million kW class ABWR, 
is 
creating expectations as a new source of power. On 24 May 1994, 
Hokuriku Electric Power submitted a proposal to Shika, Ishikawa 
Prefecture, regarding the construction of Reactor No. 2 as well 
as an environmental impact survey. At a cabinet meeting held on 
29 June 1993, to discuss energy measure, Shika was approved as 
an additional energy development site. 
  In order for Reactor No. 2 to begin operating in 2005, the 
company intends to obtain agreement from the local community and 
begin the required environmental impact survey as soon as 
possible. If Reactor No. 2 can begin operations as scheduled, 
the capability margin for 2006 will climb to 24%. When the 
output of Reactors Nos. 1 and 2 are combined, the ratio of 
nuclear power in terms of composition ratio of power generation 
will be 47%, overtaking both hydraulic and thermal power 
ratios. In the initial stage of commercial operation of Reactor 
No. 2, the company also can consider ensuring what is considered 
a reasonable margin and supply other utility companies on an 
interchange basis. 
  A 1.35 million kW-class ABWR used in constructing Reactor 
No. 
2 also is being used by Tokyo Electric Power in its 
Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant's Reactors Nos. 6 (to 
begin operations in December 1996) and 7 (to begin operations in 
July 1997) currently under construction. 
  The latest technologies, such as a nuclear reactor internal 
recirculation pump and a reinforced-concrete nuclear reactor 
containment vessel, are being utilized in ABWR. It is expected 
that a large volume BWR will become the ``main stream'' in 
future reactor development. 
  By adding a large-scale ABWR to Shika Nuclear Power Plant, 
Hokuriku Electric Power will be expanding all at once its base 
power source, with nuclear power as its nucleus. At the same 
time, the company is able to establish the best mix (an optimal 
combination of various power sources) to deal with future energy 
demands. 
<H5>  Joint Plan Involving Three Companies at Sasu Sites </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-54A>           Graphic </FIG>




  Situated in the Noto Peninsula in jurisdiction of Hokuriku 
Electric Power is Sasu (Sasu-machi, Ishikawa Prefecture) nuclear 
development site on which Hokuriku, Chubu, and Kanto Electric 
Power Companies are jointly planning to construct a nuclear 
power plant. The plan calls for the construction of 1.35 million 
kW-class Reactors Nos. 1 and 2 at two adjacent sites. As in the 
case of Shika Nuclear Power Reactor No. 2, these two sites will 
be designated as new significant power source which merits 
government support. 
  The three companies pursued power development promotional 
activities by forming Sasu Power Source Development Council, 
with Hokuriku Electric Power to be in charge of matters not 
specifically related to an individual location and those shared 
by two locations, while Chubu Electric Power and Kansai Electric 
Power to be responsible for Teraya and Takaya locations, 
respectively. Many residents of both Teraya and Takao, where 
sites are planned for construction of nuclear power plants, are 
mobile. For this reason, Sasu City is making every effort to 
obtain local consent by cooperating in policy formulation of 
``creation of new town'' in which the regional development plan 
plays a central role. 
  The three companies are cooperating in wide-area 
coordinating 
power development. They are considering the construction of two 
nuclear power sites in one city, something which has never been 
attempted before. At the present stage, in order to conduct a 
field survey at Teraya location, the companies are trying to 
obtain consent from land owners and [mobile residents]. At Takao 
location, the companies are dealing with the problem of 
reopening the construction feasibility survey which has been 
suspended. No visible progress, therefore, is being made at the 
present time. It appears that much more time will be required 
for the companies to complete the initial stage requirement 
imposed by the section of the government energy policy 
pertaining to important power source requiring government 
support. 
<H5>  Interview with Mr. Yoshio Hosokawa, Mayor of Shika </H5>
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: On 14 September, Shika Town 
Assembly voted for adding Reactor No. 2 to Shika Nuclear Power 
Plant. 
  Hosokawa: The content of the resolution was, 
``Operation of Reactor No. 1 has contributed not only to 
secondary economic effect but also to improvement in the 
well-being of local residents. Use of the subsidy received will 
make it possible for the town to reorganize social capitals and 
improve welfare facilities related to daily living of residents. 
In order to achieve further development of the town, provided 
that safety is guaranteed, we hereby pass a resolution for 
addition of Reactor No. 2 to the nuclear power facility.'' 
Although some are saying that output of the 1.35kW class ABWR is 
too large, in view of the performance record of Reactor No. 1 up 
to now, we feel that we can trust the company to continue 
providing safety measure. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What are your aiming for in 
the first place by inviting the utility company to construct a 
plant in your town? 
  Hosokawa: Regional development is the only thing 
we have in mind.. In the case of Shika Nuclear Plant, it took 26 
years before Reactor No. 1 began operating. It was back in 1965, 
when the assembly voted for nuclear power development, as you 
know. So, we did have many turns and twists, but we had 
maintained our basic posture during the whole process--that the 
construction of the nuclear power plant represented ``the use of 
land which will revitalize our region.'' Unless we utilized the 
subsidy granted under the ``Three Laws concerning power source 
development'' (Power Source Development Law, Special Account for 
Power Source Development-Related Measure Law, and Power 
Facility's Surrounding Area Improvement Law) and increased 
revenues from fixed assets centering around the regional 
development, there was no future for Shikamachi. Our vote for 
the installation of Reactor 2 stems from our determination to 
strengthen further the town's financial base so that we can take 
stronger and bigger steps toward achievement of regional 
development goals. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you tell me about the 
regional development plan which is pivotal to the revitalization 
of Shika-machi? 
  Nishikawa: The town first of all is an energy 
supply base equipped with a nuclear power plant. Secondly, the 
town is equipped with a complete industrial foundation, made 
possible by the Noto Nucleus Industrial Complex. Thirdly, 
development of the town as a resort by fully taking advantage of 
the scenic beauty of the Noto Peninsula. In other words, power 
source, industry, and resort--these three things provide a 
framework for the development of Shika-machi. 
  Surrounding cities, towns, and villages on the Noto 
Peninsula 
are aging. They are rapidly losing population every year. This 
was true of Shika-machi at one time. Although at present, our 
population has leveled off at around 17,400. By enlarging the 
three developmental frameworks, we hope to meet a somewhat lofty 
goal we have established for ourselves, namely to increase the 
size of the population to 22,000. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you discuss ``Three Laws 
Concerning Power Source Development''? 
  Nishikawa: By using a subsidy granted by the Three 
Laws, we have steadily acquired public facility equipment to 
improve road, communication, education/culture, environmental 
sanitation, social welfare, and sports recreations. As most 
other nuclear-power-plant towns probably will agree, it will be 
very helpful if the government will allow some degree of 
flexibility in handling subsidies so that each region's unique 
needs will be met. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: I have heard that you are 
considering the establishment of an endowment fund using fixed 
asset tax on nuclear power facilities. 
  Hosokawa: We submitted to the town assembly 
meeting in December our plan designed for equitable return, to 
every segment of the town, what is gained by the construction of 
the nuclear power plant on a long-term basis. We hope to be able 
to establish it under the name, ``Autonomous District 
Development Fund,'' (temporary designation) for the fiscal 1994. 
Since the Shika Nuclear Power Plant's fixed asset tax will be 
paid in 1994, our plan is to allocate this as a source of 
revenues and save up about &yen;1.2 billion to &yen;1.3 billion 
as a reserve during the next 3 years. Interests generated by 
this amount will be distributed equitably among districts 
according to the size of each district's population. We will be 
requesting the districts to use this money to pay for 
maintenance of assembly halls and regional activities as they 
see fit. We are hoping that this will bring home to them the 
kind of benefit brought about by the town's decision to go for 
nuclear power. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIM: Your vision of Shika-machi? 
  Hosokawa: It will be important to expand job opportunities 
for the young people. This will lead to population growth, also. 
Although currently 22 companies are located at the Noto 
Peninsula Industrial Complex, its occupancy rate is no more than 
60%. Our vision is focused on the creation of an 
attractive 
town where young people want to settle down and raise family. As 
a part of our effort to realize this vision, with the 
cooperation of Ishikawa Prefecture, we are planning to create 
New Town containing 430 divided lots, with each parceled lot 
measuring just over 330m[.sup]2[/]. These lots are to be sold 
at bargain prices. In other words, we are targeting a new 
Shika-machi possessing the kind of charm not easily found in big 
cities.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  As VLSI technology achieves a greater degree of 
miniaturization and high-density capabilities, users 
increasingly are demanding improved process technology and 
equipment which will enhance miniaturization process performance 
and will improve productivity. 
  Concerning etching techniques and equipment, as a wafer 
aperture becomes larger, increasingly it becomes difficult to 
ensure uniformity and to reduce etching damage. In etching 
process which utilizes ECR plasma, formation of a 
uniform-particle plasma is essential in solving the problems 
mentioned above. As the methods of obtaining uniformity in 
plasma, what have emerged thus far consist of the use of 
multi-pole magnetic field[.sup]1)[/] in the ECR plasma 
currently under research, improvement in uniformity of a 
magnetic field in the direction of wafer surface in the ECR 
region, and other such methods based on arrangement of a 
magnetic field.[.sup]2),3)[/] 
  The plasma particle density distribution is dependent not 
only on arrangement of magnetic fields but also on a microwave's 
electric field mode. In the vicinity of walls inside the plasma 
generation chamber, the above-mentioned microwave's electric 
field has a low-level strength. Moreover, diffusion of the 
plasma toward its interior walls results in lowering of plasma 
particle density. Therefore, by keeping walls of a plasma 
generation chamber away, namely, by enlarging the aperture of 
the plasma generation chamber, we can maintain the uniform 
particle density in plasma at the center of the plasma 
generation chamber involved in etching. 
  This paper will evaluate change in plasma density 
distribution, caused by the enlargement of a plasma-generating 
chamber, by measuring ionic current density. Also covered will 
be a large-aperture diameter ECR plasma etching technology, 
making a high-aspect ratio etching feasible through the 
application of the above evaluation result to the process of 
oxide film etching. 
<H5>  ECR Plasma Etching Equipment </H5>
  Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a divergent magnetic type 
ECR plasma etching equipment. Microwaves will be introduced into 
the plasma generating chamber through a tapered waveguide and a 
granite entry window of the chamber. Around the 
plasma-generating chamber, 12 multi-pole magnets are attached. 
The main coil magnetic field has been structured so as to be 
able to achieve approximate uniformity in the ECR region in the 
direction of a wafer surface. Moreover, the secondary coil 
attached to the area surrounding the reaction chamber is 
structured in such a way that it is possible to print a mirror 
magnetic field. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-57A>           Figure 1. ECR Etching Equipment Components </FIG>




  The plasma generated in the plasma chamber is irradiated on 
the specimen table inside the reaction chamber through an 
aperture. We measured ionic current density by using the single 
probe method, arranging a probe on the specimen table 
approximately 170mm away from the aperture. 
<H5>  Effects of Expansion of Plasma-Generating Chamber </H5>
  Figure 2 shows a distribution of ionic current density when 
the plasma generating-chamber's inner diameter is changed from 
200mm to 270mm while maintaining the aperture diameter at 190mm. 
Although enlarging the plasma-generating chamber's inner 
diameter will lower ionic current density centering around the 
specimen table, in the peripheral area, almost no change has 
been noted. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58A>         Figure 2. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Plasma </FIG>




  Figure 3 shows the distribution of ionic current density 
affected by the change in the aperture diameter. Change in the 
plasma chamber's inner diameter to 250mm increased the ionic 
current density, thereby improving the degree of its uniformity. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58B> Figure 3. Ionic Current Density Distribution When Aperture </FIG>



  Figure 4 shows the ionic current density distribution when 
the degree of the magnetic mirror impression is changed by the 
secondary coil. Although the effect of plasma confinement by the 
mirror magnetic field does appear, insofar as density 
distribution is concerned, no significant change is noted. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-58C> Figure 4. Ionic Current Density Distribution When </FIG>



  From the foregoing result, we have concluded that enlarging 
the diameters of both the plasma-generating chamber and the 
aperture not only expands plasma inside the reaction chamber but 
also reduces effect upon the plasma in the region of the 
irradiated specimen table by the diffusion and attenuation of 
the plasma at the plasma-generating chamber's inner walls. These 
effects enabled us to achieve the uniformity of density 
distribution. 
  Figure 5 shows the ionic current density distribution when 
12-electrode multi-pole magnets are attached to the region 
surrounding the plasma-generating chamber area so as to prevent 
scattering of the plasma toward the inner wall and to lower 
ionic temperature. We used a permanent magnet with a surface 
magnetic flux density of 3500 gauss and 45mm-block for the 
multi-pole magnet. In the surrounding area of the 
plasma-generating chamber, it is possible to attach up to 3 
blocks. As shown in Figure 5, the distribution of density is 
greatly influenced by the number of blocks attached. When only 
one block is attached, without the magnet, density distribution 
hardly changed; the tuning region of the incident microwaves, 
however, expanded, stabilizing plasma discharge. In the future, 
it will be necessary to ensure the optimal number of magnetic 
poles and blocks, as well as to optimize magnetic flux density. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-59A> Figure 5. Distribution of Ionic Current Density When the </FIG>



  In the following section, we will describe the oxide etching 
technology which uses a large aperture ECR plasma source, 
characterized by a 270mm-diameter plasma-generating chamber, a 
250mm-diameter aperture, and a multi-pole magnet (with a 1-block 
attachment). 
<H5>  Application </H5>
[.sup]4),5)[/] to Oxide Etching Process 
  Figure 6 [figure not reproduced] is a SEM photo showing a 
cross section form of a contact hole when a high-frequency bias 
potential is impressed and a thermal oxide film is etched using 
a C[.sup]4[/]F[.sub]8[/] gas plasma. With the etching 
condition producing [tai] resist selection ratio of 
approximately 10, a 50% overetching was performed. The 
only 
differences between (a) and (b) in Figure 6 are the inner 
diameter sizes of the plasma-generating chamber and the 
aperture. Other parameters (gas pressure, microwave electrical 
power, bias potential, and magnetic field) are the same. In the 
past, even under the condition in which etching normally was 
halted, the expansion of plasma generation chamber made it 
possible to continue, thereby making a high aspect ratio 
possible. This is due to the enlargement of the aperture, which 
improved the degree of uniformity of the plasma density 
distribution in the direction of the diameter and reduced 
backward drift caused by the density difference. 
  Figure 7 shows the etching velocity and the in-plane 
distribution of [tai] resist selection ratio based on an 8-inch 
diameter wafer. We were able to obtain the thermal oxide etching 
velocity of 340nm/min and etching uniformity within 5%, 
plus or 
minus, which are sufficient for handling an 8-inch wafer process. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-59B> Figure 7. Distribution of Etching Velocity and [tai] </FIG>



  Figure 8 [figure not reproduced] shows the shape of a 
cross-section of a 1.6-micron-thick BPSG film when a 50% 
overetching was applied. We were able to achieve the type of 
etching which produces the same form whether in center or in a 
peripheral area of the wafer. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  By expanding diameters of both the internal part of the 
plasma generating chamber and the aperture, we were able to 
obtain the uniform distribution of ionic current density on the 
specimen table. This is due to reduced effect on the specimen 
table's irradiated plasma of plasma diffusion in the direction 
of the plasma generating chamber walls. 
  As a result of application of the large aperture diameter 
ECR 
plasma to oxide etching process, even under the high-selectivity 
condition (under which etching did not progress when the 
conventional small aperture diameter plasma generation chamber 
was used), we were able to obtain good etching form. Moreover, 
with respect to the 8-inch diameter wafer, we were able to 
achieve uniform etching with its velocity uniformity within 
5%, 
plus or minus. 
  Since the large aperture ECR plasma etching unit can 
generate 
uniform particle plasma in the low gas pressure region, it can 
be expected to serve as an etching device offering uniformity, 
high aspect ratio, and low damage features.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Since its birth, the integrated circuit (IC) has continued 
to 
be the target of technological innovation effort. Even today, 
work continues to achieve an aggregation of high-level 
functions, large memory, and a high degree of density. As a 
result, the number of element per chip has increased, and a 
demand for 3-dimensionality, which makes further miniaturization 
of elements and routing possible, intensifies. Moreover, from 
the standpoint of effective pricing, enlargement of wafer's 
aperture will be unavoidable. 
  If such demands are to be met, the capabilities of 
manufacturing equipment used in each fabrication process of VLSI 
must be improved so that the present limitations can be 
overcome. Plasma etching equipment is one such piece of 
equipment. 
  In order to improve capabilities of the existing RF plasma 
equipment characterized by a parallel flatboard, a method 
designed to adjust process conditions and RF circuits is tried 
out, while at the same time an effort to develop a 
non-conventional method designed to search for low pressure 
process conditions is being pursued. For this reason, it will be 
necessary to develop a means of generating plasma. At present, 
its applicability to plasma etching equipment by inductive 
coupling, such as ECR and magnetron-method discharge technology, 
and helicon wave [.sup]1)[/] and RFi discharge 
technologies,[.sup]2),3)[/] is being searched. 
  This paper will report on the RFi discharge technology with 
some test results. 
  Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a test equipment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-60A> Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Test Equipment </FIG>



<H5>  RF Plasma Generation by Inductive Coupling </H5>
  This means a plasma generated by the electrical field 
induced 
by the radio frequency (RF) currents impressed on electric 
circuits connected to RF electrical source. Hereinafter, for the 
sake of simplicity, it will be referred to as RF induction 
plasma. 
<H5>  1. Heating and Confining of Electrons </H5>
  The process of generating the plasma used in semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment involves ionization resulting from the 
collision of traveling free electrons, possessing energy greater 
than a certain appropriate value, with neutral particles. Since 
electrons are far smaller than neutral particles, their average 
distance of free traveling is longer, and under low pressure 
(mTorr level), even if they gain energy, collision does not 
occur, dissipating directly at the chamber wall surface, 
frequently not participating in ionization. Consequently, in 
order to generate plasmas efficiently, it will be necessary to 
confine free electrons into a chamber using some appropriate 
method. 
  The methods of heating electrons currently known are: 
  (1) one which uses inductive electrical field using a 
parallel flatboard-based electrical field; 
  (2) a method which uses inductive electrical field based on 
coils; 
  (3) ECR or helicon wave heating method which uses 
electromagnetic waves. 
  In the case of ECR heating, since electronic energy in the 
magnetic field becomes discrete in the direction vertical to the 
magnetic field,[.sup]4)[/] it exhibits resonance 
characteristic possessing sharp peak when electrons are heated. 
In the direction parallel to the magnetic field, on the other 
hand, since electron energy is continuous, it is believed that 
heating by helicon waves is carried out with a sufficiently wide 
energy width. Moreover, confining free electrons is accomplished 
generally by use of the magnetic field; however, in the coil 
inductive electrical field, by inducing the concentric circle 
electrical field using the shape of coils, to some extent 
confining effect can be produced sometimes. 
<H5>  2. Generation of Inductive Plasma Generation </H5>
  Coils used in this testing are produced by changing the 
shape 
of the coils described in published reports[.sup]2),3)[/] to 
an approximately spiral form. 
  We obtained distribution of degrees of intensity of 
electromagnetic fields using a numerical computation when the 
exterior of the coil is made GND potential and RF current is 
impressed. At a point located 35mm from the coil's surface, as 
shown in Figure 2, we noticed the presence of a strong 
electrical field at a midpoint between the interior coil and 
exterior coil. It is reasonable to suppose that centering around 
this portion, plasma will be generated and diffused to 
peripheral areas. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61A> Figure 2. Inductive Electromagnetic Fields by RF </FIG>



  Moreover, since the electrical field is induced in a roughly 
concentric shape, electrons which acquired energy probably 
repeat rotating motions changing their directions periodically, 
thereby gradually enlarging radius and fade on the chamber wall 
surface unless collision with neutral particles or rebonding 
with ions occur. 
<H5>  3. Absorption of Electromagnetic Energy </H5>
  When outer magnetic fields are absent, a diffusion relation 
formula as shown in (1) can be established for the dissemination 
of electromagnetic waves present in the plasma[.sup]5)[/]: 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61D> Equation </FIG>
_o_[.sup]2[/]=_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]+C[.sup]2[/]_k_[.sup] 
2[/] (1) 
  Here _o_ represents the angular velocity of 
electromagnetic 
waves, _o_[.sup]p[/] angular velocity of plasma vibrations, 
and C the velocity of light in a vacuum, and _k_ the wave 
number 
of electromagnetic waves. 
  From equation (1), when plasma density increases and 
_o_[.sup]p[/] becomes larger, at a certain value, 
C[.sup]2[/]_o_[.sup]2[/]'s value becomes negative, clearly 
showing drastic attenuation of the electromagnetic waves. Their 
attenuation properties at that time is expressed in the 
following equation (2): 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61E> Equation </FIG>
  exp[-z/¯] (2) 
  however, ¯=C x 
(_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]-_o_[.sup]2[/])[.sup]-1/2[/] (3) 
  Equation (3) is known as the depth of penetration, showing a 
distance in which the strength of electromagnetic wave is 
attenuated to e[.sup]-1[/]. If the electron density of plasma 
is hypothesized as 5 x 10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]-3[/], ¯ is 
approximately 0.8cm and the distance to the wafer is below 1/7, 
the LSI circuits on the wafer are likely to be destroyed by 
inductive electromagnetic waves. 
<H5>  Plasma Diffusion </H5>
  The RF inductive plasmas formed on the upper perimeters of 
the chamber are thought to be diffused to both electrodes. This 
is where the RF inductive plasmas differ from the parallel 
flatboard RF plasmas. 
  In other words, plasmas are generated for the most part in 
accordance with the previously-mentioned electrical field 
strength distribution. It is conjectured that those in the 
radial direction fade when they come into contact with the wall 
surface while those in the Z direction fade on the wafer or 
suscepter surface. 
  Based on the hypothesis that the plasma density is 
proportionate to the distribution of the strength of the 
inductive electrical fields, we have calculated numerical value 
of the state of diffusion. The result is shown in Figure 3. 
Assuming that the velocity of internal flow does not exist, we 
applied the diffusion equation shown as the equation 
(4).[.sup]6)[/] 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61C> Figure 3. Plasma Diffusion </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-61B> Equation </FIG>


  N(X,Y,Z) denotes plasma density, Q(X,Y,Z) the volume of 
plasma generated, and D a diffusion coefficient. 
  For the Z-axial direction, we can expect a good uniform 
plasma with an appropriate diffusion length. 
<H5>  Measurement of RF Inductive Plasma </H5>
  We observed several attributes of the RF inductive plasma 
using the Langmuir probe and the emission spectral measurement 
method. 
<H5>  1. Measurement by Langmuir Probe </H5>

  Observation state is as shown in Figure 1, and gas is Ar. 
  For probe, we used a PMT product, Fast probe. Figure 4 shows 
the dependence of electron density N[.sup]e[/] and 
electron temperature T[.sup]e[/] on pressure. 
Figure 5 shows dependence of electron density 
N[.sup]e[/] and electron temperature 
T[.sup]e[/] on electric power. Moreover, Figure 6 
shows the radial directional distribution of ion-saturated 
currents. We can see from it that as pressure drops, the degree 
of uniformity of the central zone becomes higher. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62A>           Figure 4. Pressure Dependence of Electron Density and </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62B>           Figure 5. Power Dependence of Electron Density and </FIG>




<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62C> Figure 6. Distribution of Ion-Saturated Current in Radial </FIG>




<H5>  2. Measurement by Emission Spectra </H5>
  We measured Ar's emission spectral pressure dependence using 
1-150mTorr. Luminescence from the 1-2cm plasma on the susceptor 
is condensed and [spectralized] using a lens on the chamber-side 
wall. Normalized results based on the maximum intensity of each 
individual luminescent wavelength are shown in Figure 7. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-62D> Figure 7. Pressure Dependence of Ar Luminescence </FIG>



   In general, emissions from Ar radical exhibited a greater 
degree of intensity than those from ions. Moreover, the 
intensity of radical emissions, although differed, depending on 
transition, had a peak exceeding 10mTorr, and when pressure 
falls, its intensity also decreased monotonically. Luminescence 
from ions, on the other hand, increased monotonically when 
pressure is lowered, reaching the maximum level around 1mTorr. 
These results demonstrated that the lower the pressure, the 
higher the electron temperature will become. 
  We let the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas flow and checked change in 
intensity in the range of 6-40mTorr for each type of 
luminescence. Its results are shown in Figure 8. In the 
direction of decreasing pressures, the emission of the 
CF[.sup]3[/] radical exhibited monotonic decrease while the 
CF radical ended up having the peak around 11mTorr. The 
luminescence of C.H.F radical, moreover, showed a substantial 
increase of approximately 10 times. Verification of its 
correlation with selectivity will be undertaken in the near 
future. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63A>           Figure 8. Pressure Dependence of CHF[.sup]3[/] </FIG>





<H5>  Characteristics of Oxide Film Etching </H5>
  Using Ar and CHF[.sup]3[/] gases, we performed the 
SiO[.sup]2[/] film etching to investigate several 
characteristics associated with it. 
<H5>  1. Uniformity </H5>

  As shown in Figure 9, a gas inlet was provided at two 
locations. When the Ar gas (100%) was used, the radial 
directional distribution of the plasma-ion-saturated currents on 
the wafer, as shown in Figure 6, was approximately uniform. The 
result of the sputter etching performed by impressing 400kHz 
bias on the susceptor is shown in Figure 9. Uneven etching speed 
might be caused by the side positioning of the electrode facing 
the susceptor. We used the wafer with a Si substrate on which 
thermal oxide film of 1 micron thickness was grown. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63B>           Figure 9. Characteristics of Etching with Use of </FIG>




   Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas, we performed the similar 
etching. Its result is shown in Figure 10. Etching is proceeding 
in a region spreading to peripheral area from the [orifura] 
part. This probably was due to the positional relationship among 
gas inductive inlet, susceptor, and exhaust outlet. Figure 11 
shows the computed value of gas flow on the wafer. Because of 
the constraint of computing algorithms, although we used a 
somewhat higher pressure state (20mTorr 100mTorr) in our 
computation, the diagram constitutes a clear explanation of the 
etching result. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-63C>           Figure 10. Characteristics of Etching with Use of </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-64A>           Figure 11. Distribution of the Velocity of Gas </FIG>




   Judging from the result, it will be necessary to design the 
optimal positioning of a gas induction inlet, susceptor, and 
exhaust outlet in order to achieve etching at a uniform speed. 
<H5>  2. Etching Velocity </H5>
  Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] (100%) gas, we checked the 
etching velocity of an 8-inch oxide film wafer. Its result is 
shown in Figure 12. When we raised pressure by increasing the 
volume of a flow, we obtained a peak pressure at approximately 
20mTorr, and anything above that number has reduced etching 
velocity. Since it is in the domain in which increase in plasma 
concentration occurs when pressure rises and since bias electric 
power is constant, we are yet to ascertain the cause for this, 
whether it is due to a decrease in per-ionic energy in the 
sheath or an increase in deposit on the oxide film surface.

<H5>  Characteristics of Etching by Parallel Flat Electrode </H5>
  For etching process, RF plasma by a parallel flatboard 
electrode was used in the past. In early days, it was used in a 
high-pressure domain (number Torr). However, today, as circuits 
become increasingly minute, application of a low-pressure domain 
(a few 100mTorr) to etching process has become feasible. 
  In the future, the question of whether both highly 
innovative 
new RF circuit technology and development of new process will be 
able to meet future demands for minute processing of 256MDRAM 
and 11GDRAM provides an interesting problem. 
<H5>  1. Structure </H5>
  The parallel flat electrode unit is a type of structure 
already well known and has survived into today, with a few 
improvements in the electrode peripheral area mechanisms, as 
well as in a method of supplying RF electrical power, so that it 
can deal with a low pressure process. 
<H5>  2. Plasma Characteristics </H5>
  Since the parallel flatboard electrode unit lacks the data 
measured directly by the Langmuir Probe, our description will be 
limited to that of the emission spectral characteristics. 
  The foremost characteristic of the narrow-gap parallel 
flatboard Ar plasma is that ionic strength toward radical 
luminescence intensity is much greater than that of the RF 
inductive plasma. (Figure 14). Although it differs by 
wavelength, the ion/radical ratio of the parallel flatboard 
plasma for the most part is greater by two digits than that of 
the RF inductive plasma. This is due to higher electron 
temperature of the parallel flatboard type. With the inductive 
type, moreover, the number of ions decreases because of ionic 
recoupling occurring during transport of plasma. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-65C>           Figure 14. Ar Emission Spectrum </FIG>




<H5>  3. Oxide Film Etching Characteristics </H5>
  Figure 15 shows the pressure dependence when oxide film was 
etched using our company product ``TE5000S.'' We were able to 
obtain excellent results. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-66A>           Figure 15. Etching Characteristics of TE5000S </FIG>




  Figure 16 [figure not reproduced] shows the result of 
etching 
BPS film contact holes measuring 0.33 microns in diameter. The 
figure shows good values obtained for etching velocity and 
selection ratio (against Si). 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
<H5>  1. RF Inductive Plasma Characteristics </H5>
  Although several types of structures can be suggested for 
the 
RF inductive plasma, depending on positional relationship of a 
coil and a chamber, this time, we used the type in which RF coil 
is installed facing the wafer to conduct a few of our tests. 
  By using lower pressure (mTorr ˜ few tens mTorr) than 
that 
used with the parallel flatboard electrode unit, we were able to 
verify the generation of plasma with sufficient level of density 
adequate for etching processing. 
  Moreover, although this structure lacked the GND electrode 
facing the susceptor, we were able to verify excellent etching 
of oxide film in which current is designed to flow through the 
chamber side wall. 
<H5>  2. Problems </H5>
  Although the equipment operates with a pressure level lower 
than that of the existing parallel-flatboard-electrode-type 
equipment by one or two digits, because the plasma used is a 
diffusion plasma. We expect that, in terms of the emission 
spectral characteristics mentioned previously also, its electron 
temperature will be somewhat lower. When CHF[.sup]3[/] and 
CF[.sup]4[/] gases are used, it is natural to expect that 
each molecule's constituent ratio during the process will differ. 
  Consequently, with respect to oxide film etching also, in 
order to obtain good results in selectivity involving resist and 
Si, as well as in microloading effect, an effort to develop a 
new process will become essential. 
  Moreover, as mentioned previously, since uniformity in 
generated plasma exhibits pressure dependence, it appears that 
with the present structure, it is not easy to obtain a wide 
process window. In order to deal with this problem, perhaps coil 
part should be split so that each electrical power can be 
adjusted. If this should become feasible, then the distribution 
of plasma density can be controlled, easing pressure dependence. 
If we are to establish such a technology, we believe that it may 
be possible to use the RF inductive plasma effectively as a 
future etching device.

  [Text] Science and Technology Director-General Eda's report 
on the 1993 Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper was acknowledged 
at a Cabinet meeting on 30 November. The white paper focuses on 
the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants, an issue that has 
gained international attention, and gives a detailed account of 
the safety measures set forth by the Nuclear Safety Commission 
(Yasuyoshi Togo, chairman) for light water reactors (LWRs), 
advanced thermal converter reactors (ATRs), and fast breeder 
reactors (FBRs). The paper notes that plutonium use in power 
plants already has a good safety record and cites the fact that 
plutonium, converted from uranium, has been burned inside 
nuclear power plants and accounts for 30% of Japan's 
atomic 
energy. 
  (Summary on p 7) 
  The Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper consists of three 
parts. The first part describes the Nuclear Safety Commission's 
activities over the past year and its safety policies. The 
second part is a special edition about ensuring the safety of 
nuclear reactors that use plutonium for fuel. The third part 
contains data. 
  In addition to presenting the Nuclear Safety Commission's 
policies, the first part of the paper also brings up the 
problems with Russia: nuclear energy safety measures there, its 
dumping of radioactive wastes into the ocean, the explosion at 
the Tomusk-7 military recycling plant, and so forth. 
  This is the second time that the Nuclear Energy Safety White 
Paper features a special edition on the plutonium issue; last 
year, the paper discussed the nuclear fuel cycle. The Nuclear 
Energy White Paper also aims to reinforce, from the aspect of 
safety, understanding about the government's policies on 
plutonium use, which has caused apprehension in other countries. 
  [p 7] 
  [Text] ``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear 
Power Plant Facilities'' is the special edition in the 1993 
Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper. While last year's paper took 
up the issue of plutonium production in the nuclear fuel cycle, 
this year's paper discusses the safety of plutonium use in the 
LWRs, ATRs, and FBRs of nuclear power plants. There are three 
basic policies on ensuring safety: to reduce the amounts of 
radioactive substances, to provide multiple forms of protection, 
and to isolate facilities that use plutonium from the public. 
The paper also introduces the characteristics of plutonium and 
explains that, although plutonium emits alpha rays and weak 
gamma rays, the alpha rays only escape about four centimeters 
into the air; the gamma rays are weak, too, so there is not much 
of a safety problem if simple shielding is provided. 
  Regarding the effects when plutonium is taken into the human 
body, examples from past accidents have indicated the danger of 
cancer occurring due to the long-term effects of radiation in 
the body when plutonium is drawn into the lungs and then 
accumulates mainly in the lungs, liver, and bones. For that 
reason Japan is aiming for safety with the establishment of 
standard radiation dose values for bones (2.4 sieverts), lungs 
(3.0 sieverts), and the liver (5 sieverts), in addition to the 
conventional levels of radiation exposure. 
  The paper also emphasizes that there are already results 
from 
the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants: because plutonium 
is produced inside reactors when uranium absorbs neutrons, 
plutonium is burned within reactors now. Owing to that, about 
30% of the energy generated by LWRs is produced by the 
plutonium that is modified within the reactors. In other words, 
there is essentially no difference with the nuclear reactors 
that use uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel (MOX). Therefore, by 
taking into account the amount of plutonium that will be 
handled, safety measures can be maintained adequately. 
  Based on such results, the paper notes that safety can be 
maintained in FBRs, which use plutonium only, by adequately 
implementing inspections of those parts of the FBRs that differ 
with LWRs. 
  The paper takes up technical topics such as sodium as the 
FBR's coolant material and operation under high temperatures, 
breedable reactor cores that use MOX fuel, and the cover gas 
that isolates the surface of the liquid sodium from the air, 
then points out that FBR inspections covering that which differs 
from LWRs are implemented. The measures taken in dealing with 
sodium coolant, for example, involve verification of the 
suitability of the structural design of the equipment used for 
the sodium, and incorporating into the design safety measures to 
prevent chemical activation of the sodium by means of an inert 
gas, leakage detection, and suppression and reduction of the 
thermal effects of combustion. 
  In addition, in an assessment of the completed Monju FBR, 
the 
paper presents an analysis of a hypothetical accident in which 
large amounts of radioactive substances are released. According 
to that analysis, if a a big accident such as leakage of the 
primary coolant or a hypothetical accident were to occur, the 
public would be separated far enough from the exposure dose. 
  The Fugen ATR, which has already been in operation for 15 
years, has not produced a single failed fuel element. Measures 
have also been taken to improve its void coefficient--the 
reaction when the coolant boils and many steam bubbles are 
formed--which had been considered a problem. As a result, 
nuclear reactor control with enough margin is now possible. 
  As for LWRs, the paper states that loading one-third of the 
reactor core with MOX fuel will not affect the characteristics 
of the core. The reasons are that, in comparison with uranium, 
there is little drop in reactivity when MOX fuel is used, and 
that the nature of the reactor is such that if the reactivity 
rises it will then drop on its own. On the other hand, there is 
also a problem in that the control rods tend to lose their 
effectiveness and the output can grow large locally. Although 
there are items that need to be addressed in the design, the 
safety of [plutonium use in] LWRs was confirmed in demonstration 
tests using the No. 1 reactor of Kansai Electric Power Company's 
Mihama power plant. 
  The paper also uses a question-and-answer format to explain 
in simple terms about social problems, e.g., Russia's dumping of 
low-level radioactive waste into the ocean, nuclear reactors and 
earthquakes, and the issue of acknowledgement of power plant 
workers' accidents involving leukemia.

  [Text] The 1993 Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper 
acknowledged in a Cabinet meeting the other day takes up the 
issue of the safety of plutonium. More than 40% of the 
main 
body of the paper is used to explain that various measures are 
being taken to ensure safety. In regard to the safety of 
plutonium, the over-sea transport of plutonium by the 
Akatsuki-Maru was the turning point since which apprehension has 
been spreading among the people of Japan. For Japan, which puts 
the nuclear fuel cycle as the pillar of its government policies 
on atomic energy, wiping out this apprehension has become an 
urgent issue. Given that alone, it is a good thing that a 
definite assessment was given in the Nuclear Energy Safety White 
Paper. Nevertheless, in promoting atomic energy, which is a 
basis for non-fossil-fuel energy, constant effort aimed at 
molding public acceptance is essential, and, while making doubly 
sure about ensuring safety, the government should also use any 
opportunity to get the people's understanding. 
  Excluding the data section, the main body of the Nuclear 
Energy Safety White Paper consists of two sections: ``The 
Current State of Nuclear Energy Safety Ensurance Measures'' and 
``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Power Plant 
Facilities.'' The two parts of the paper describe in detail the 
measures for ensuring safety in nuclear reactors when the 
plutonium formed in the nuclear fuel cycle is used. 
  Plutonium is obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. 
There is apprehension about the effects on the human body due to 
radiation and chemical toxicity if plutonium is ingested or 
inhaled. The chemical toxicity of plutonium is like that of 
heavy metals. Although plutonium is thought to cause kidney 
damage, the stance taken in the white paper is that there should 
be more concern about the effects due to its radiation because 
the specific radioactivity of plutonium is higher than that of 
uranium. For that reason the paper focuses on FBRs, ATRs, and 
LWRs in explaining how to prevent leaks and which other sorts of 
measures should be taken to guarantee safety when plutonium is 
actually burned in reactors to generate electrical power. It is 
made clear that everything possible at the present point in time 
is being done. 
  However, what must be considered here is that the opposition 
to and unease about the use of plutonium are due in part to the 
many technical unknowns. Actually, the Monju prototype FBR has 
not yet reached criticality, and the Fugen prototype ATR is in 
the stage of continued operation. The use of plutonium in an LWR 
is slated to begin in the middle of this decade. Certainly the 
government is compelled to recognize that the technological 
incompleteness is what arouses anxiety. 
  The government must also pay heed to the fact that the 
suspicions about undue information regulation for the purpose of 
protecting nuclear substances is one of the grounds of the 
argument against plutonium use. Although measures to guard 
against mishaps such as nuclear hijacking are essential, the 
government should recognize that opening up to public as much 
information as possible is an important scheme that will appease 
the opposition. 
  Furthermore, we cannot ignore the fact that an increasing 
number of prudent nations in Europe and America are on the route 
to a nuclear fuel cycle. Rather than worrying so much about 
safety, the attitudes in Europe and America are based on reasons 
such as financial difficulties, doubts about the economy of 
FBRs, and preventing nuclear proliferation. Nevertheless, it is 
inevitable that doubts as to why only Japan sticks out will be 
stirred up. Safety is not the only problem with the use of 
plutonium.

  [Text] It has been a little over a month since it became 
clear that Russia resumed its dumping of radioactive waste into 
the Sea of Japan. At the London meeting, held until 12 November, 
of the nations that signed a treaty on the regulation of ocean 
dumping (the London Treaty), the decision was made to ban all 
dumping of radioactive waste into the ocean. Japan, as well, 
relinquished its option on the ocean dumping of low-level 
radioactive waste. There is also an indication that the problem 
of nuclear power plants discharging radioactive wastewater into 
the ocean will lead to unexpected consequences. Concerned 
parties worry that ``atomic energy development will be driven 
into a difficult position because of the waste problem.'' 
  When the revisions to the London Treaty were decided by an 
overwhelming majority, an official of the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) disclosed the following: ``We cannot go against the 
trend toward banning all ocean dumping of radioactive waste. 
But, in a form that appears to yield to the pressure, hasn't 
Japan given the impression of having distorted the meaning of 
its government policies on nuclear energy?'' 
  ``Pressure'' means the suddenly loud calls in government 
circles saying that ``to make Russia stop the dumping, Japan 
should take the initiative and stop dumping waste into the 
ocean.'' 
  For fourteen years up until 1969 Japan was dumping 
medical-use radioactive isotopes and other such radioactive 
waste into the open sea, but since then has not been doing so. 
At the on-land radioactive waste processing facilities in Aomori 
Prefecture's Rokkasho-mura, a low-level radioactive waste burial 
center went into operation last year. The STA claims that burial 
space that will last for ``several decades to almost a century'' 
has been secured and that the provisions for on-land disposal 
are adequate. 
  Nevertheless, the possibility still remained for ocean 
dumping as an arrangement in case the use of nuclear energy 
becomes more vigorous in the future. Eventually, however, the 
Atomic Energy Commission (chaired by Science and Technology 
Director-General Eda) preceded the London Treaty meeting and 
decided on 2 December that ``ocean dumping is not an option.'' 
  Indeed, the Atomic Energy Commission is not completely 
letting go its attachment to ocean dumping, saying that ``if the 
situation changes significantly in the future, a change of 
government policy will also be considered.'' At least there is 
an air of welcoming the fact that conditions were attached: 
whether or not to continue the ban on the ocean dumping of 
low-level waste will be reconsidered every 25 years. 
  What sort of effect Japan's ``concession'' will have on 
Russia's dumping ban is another ticklish point. Russia, along 
with the U.K. and France, abstained from voting on revisions to 
the treaty. If the abstentionist countries lodge an objection 
before the treaty goes into effect, they will not be bound by 
the treaty. An ironic situation where Russia continues dumping 
while Japan bans it is likely to arise. 
  Japan's nuclear energy development is coming to a crucial 
turning point. Next spring, for example, the Monju FBR will 
achieve criticality. Under a coalition government that includes 
the strongly anti-nuclear Socialist Party of Japan, the 
quarelling between the pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions is 
approaching a delicate stage. Given that situation, there is a 
strong feeling among the pro-nuclear side that altering the 
basic government policy ``would amount to showing the 
anti-nuclear side our weakness.'' 
  That unease has materialized in an unexpected form. Once 
again radiation released from Japan's nuclear power plants was 
highlighted when Russia's Nuclear Power and Energy Minister 
Mihailof came to Japan and announced that ``Tokyo Electric 
Power's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant releases about 10 
curies of radioactive tritium per year.'' 
  The total amount of radioactivity that Russia dumped into 
the 
Sea of Japan in October was 0.38 curies (the initial 
announcement was 1.08 curies). Mihailof daringly tried to 
emphasize the insignificance of the effects of his country's 
ocean dumping and seemed to be citing Japan's nuclear power 
plants as an example to support his case. His statement was 
conveyed to Korea where it caused an uproar that invited the 
passionate opposition of the Korean people. 
  Nuclear power plants evaporate and concentrate their cooling 
water and wash water, filter it to reduce the level of 
radioactivity, then release it into the ocean along with thermal 
effluent. In the case of tritium, Japanese power plants that 
release 100 curies or more per year are not unusual. 
  Nuclear power facilities release radioactivity in the 
gaseous 
form as well as in liquid form. The government and the electric 
power industry say that ``there is no problem when it comes to 
safety.'' Their true intent, however, is that if possible they 
would like the matter to be left alone. 
  Greenpeace, the international environmental protection group 
that was encouraged with this recent all-out ban on ocean 
dumping, takes the standpoint where it ``regards all 
radioactivity released into the environment from nuclear power 
facilities, including waste liquids, as a problem.'' Greenpeace 
Japan is also eager to ``aim at Monju's criticality and take up 
the issue of radioactivity discharged into the environment.'' 
  Science and Technology Director-General Eda's stance is to 
change the point of attack: ``The ocean dumping by Russia is a 
problem of another dimension compared to the release of 
radioactivity from nuclear power facilities.'' Nevertheless, 
there are more than a few concerned parties who take the 
radioactivity discharge problem as if it were a body blow and 
worry about how it will impact the future of atomic energy 
development.

  [Text] At 8:30 AM on 25 November in the town gymnasium of 
Onagawa- machi, MITI started the first public hearing on the 
construction of the Onogawa No. 3 nuclear power plant. Tohoku 
Electric Power Company is planning to build the plant (in Miyagi 
Prefecture). The last public hearing on nuclear power facilities 
that MITI held was a hearing on Tokyo Electric Power Company's 
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa No. 6 nuclear power plant over six years ago. 
  Dozens of members of an anti-nuclear group who were opposed 
to the hearing barged into the entrance of the gymnasium to 
protest and shout their slogans. Chaos ensued when some members 
of the group forcefully broke through the entrance gate and 
jostled with MITI officials and Miyage Prefecture police. 
  The hearing started with an explanation of Tohoku Electric 
Power Company's plans to establish the new facility. Then, 20 
people selected beforehand from five nearby towns stated their 
opinions, and company officials responded to their questions. 
  The Onogawa No. 3 power plant, which will have a 
conventional 
boiling- water reactor (BWR) like plants No. 1 and No. 2, will 
have an output of 825,000 kW. Commercial operation of plant No. 
3 is planned to begin in March 2002. 
  The Onogawa No. 1 power plant (524,000 kW) is already in 
commercial operation. Plant No. 2 (825,000 kW) has been under 
construction since 1989; the target for its completion is 1995. 
However, nearby residents have instituted a law suit demanding 
suspension of the construction of No. 2 plant. For the first 
time in Japan a court order was given in June mandating the 
submission of the nuclear reactor's internal data and materials, 
such as security provisions.

  [Text] Regular operation of the electric furnace (a 
continuous sintering furnace) that burns and hardens pellets at 
the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.'s (PNC) 
Tokai plutonium fuel production facility (Tokai-mura, Ibaraki 
Prefecture) started on 25 November. The facility had been 
producing fuel for the initial loading of the Monju prototype 
FBR power plant (electrical output, 28 kW; located in Tsuruga 
City, Fukui Prefecture), but a breakdown in the continuous 
sintering furnace on 7 June caused a temporary suspension of the 
fuel production. Monju was to achieve criticality in October, 
but that date was pushed up about six months because of the 
suspension of fuel production. For that reason the PNC invested 
in a batch furnace to augment the continuous sintering furnace 
and has been producing fuel with the two furnaces in parallel 
since October. 
  With the regular operation of the continuous sintering 
furnace now started, the FBR fuel production line is completely 
restored.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Power Company and the Central 
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI; Naoshi 
Yoda, director) started joint research with the U.S. Department 
of Energy on metal fuel as the future fuel for FBRs. Present-day 
FBRs use mixed-oxide fuel that is ceramic, but switching to 
metal fuel will serve to increase thermal efficiency and make 
reprocessing easier. 
  Metal fuel is an alloy of uranium, plutonium, and zirconium. 
Because metal fuel, like mixed-oxide fuel, does not contain 
oxygen, its heat- transfer rate is good. Metal fuel can 
efficiently supply heat to the coolant material, sodium, without 
raising the temperature of parts of the reactor core. That makes 
possible smaller FBRs with the same output as larger FBRs that 
use mixed-oxide fuel. In addition, the nature of the nuclear 
reaction is such that when the temperature of the fuel rises, 
the nuclear reaction is inhibited. So, metal fuel has another 
strong point in that the inhibitory effect increases if the 
heat-transfer rate is good. 
  After it is burned the metal fuel melts, then electricity is 
passed through it to make it adhere to electrodes so that the 
plutonium and uranium can be recovered. The process of 
dissolving the fuel in nitric acid, as performed with 
mixed-oxide fuel, is not necessary, and dry reprocessing can be 
done. 
  Metal fuel had not been practical in the past because gas 
was 
generated when the fuel was heated, causing it to swell up and 
break easily. Mixed-oxide fuel is ceramic with many small gaps, 
so the gas can escape and there is no worry about the fuel 
breaking. 
  Although the problem can be circumvented by creating small 
gaps between the inside of the metal fuel and its cladding tube, 
that was not practical because the thermal efficiency dropped. 
The Japan Atomic Power Co., CRIEPI, and the U.S. DOE solved both 
the problems of the thermal expansion and the drop in thermal 
efficiency by filling up the spaces between the metal fuel and 
the cladding tube with sodium. Next, they will look into core 
designs that are suitable for metal fuel. 
  Since 1964 the U.S. DOE has been conducting research on 
metal 
fuel at an FBR in Idaho, the EBR-II (output, 20,000 kw). Japan 
waits until next year for the first criticality of the Monju 
FBR, which uses mixed-oxide fuel. Japan will also move forward 
with research on metal fuel, the next-generation fuel.

  [Text] The Research and Development Corporation of Japan's 
(Nobuhisa Akabane, Chairman) Aono Atom Surface Control Project 
(Masakazu Aono, Director) has developed technology to greatly 
reduce the manufacturing time for atomic-scale ``atomcraft.'' 
  ``Atomcraft'' is a cutting-edge technology which can be used 
to grab [extract] and release atoms, one-by-one. Minute 
characters or designs are drawn by the atoms. 
  Various techniques have been researched, but the one being 
used by this project is the STM (scanning tunneling microscope) 
method. When a 5-volt 30-millisecond pulse voltage is applied to 
the STM probe, atoms adhere to the tip of the probe. The pulse 
voltage is also applied when the atom adhering to the tip is 
released. However, even under the same conditions, atoms cannot 
always be successfully manipulated by applying a voltage pulse. 
Therefore, up until now, after pulse voltage was applied, it was 
necessary to confirm whether the atom was adhering to the probe 
tip or had been released by using the original function of the 
STM as a microscopic device. 
  This project research group developed a method to detect a 
feeble signal change which occurs when the atom adheres to the 
probe or when the atom is released from the probe. This made it 
possible to analyze the circumstances of the atomic manipulation 
in real time and detect, with certainty, whether the atom was 
adhering to the probe or had been released. 
  They succeeded in moving atoms on the silicon surface at 
will 
by using this real time atomic analysis technology. In addition, 
they were able to construct atomcraft made with hydrogen atoms 
on the silicon surface. 
  In future research, they plan to take up the challenge of 
real time analysis of atoms other than silicon or hydrogen.

  [Text] The U.S. decision last week to maintain its distinct 
patent system disappointed Japanese government and industry 
officials, who said it will further delay global patent 
harmonization efforts. 
  However, in a significant change, the Clinton administration 
has promised to seek a statutory change limiting the duration of 
U.S. technology patents to 20 years from the time of application. 
  That provision would put the United States in harmony with 
Japan and Europe. The Clinton administration unveiled this shift 
late last month in negotiations under the U.S.-Japan trade 
framework. 
  Japan and Europe have long pushed the United States to 
replace its first-to-invent patent system with the widely used 
first-to-file system. 
  The U.S. system awards the patent to the inventor who can 
prove the earliest date of invention, even if it means removing 
the patent from its original recipient. The first-to-file system 
gives the patent to the inventor who files a patent application 
first. 
  ``The first-to-invent system has served us well in the past, 
and while the United States may move to first-to-file sometime 
in the future, I am not convinced that enough small inventors 
and entrepreneurs would benefit if we made a switch at this 
time,'' Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said. 
  An official at Japan's Patent Office said, ``It is 
regrettable that the United States still sticks to its unique 
system. It takes a great deal to prove who invented first. It is 
much easier and clearer to determine who filed the application 
first.'' 
  The U.S. refusal to change the principle would stall the 
patent harmonization talks at the 141-member World Intellectual 
Property Organization in Geneva, Japanese officials say. 
  As for the duration of patents, Japanese officials remain 
skeptical of the U.S. pledge. 
  Said Hajime Aoyama, senior managing director at the Japan 
Patent Association, ``The White House has pledged the change in 
the calculation method, but it is still doubtful that the U.S. 
Congress will approve the change.'' 
  Under current U.S. law, a patent is effective for 17 
years--not from the time of the application but from the time of 
registration. 
  In 1992, the U.S. patent authority suddenly awarded a patent 
to a U.S. inventor in Nevada who filed an application 38 years 
ago for technology to inspect parts through electric monitoring. 
Japanese automakers are liable to pay royalties for using the 
technology for 17 years until the patent expires in the year 
2004--55 years from the application. 
  Such patents are called ``submarine'' patents because they 
cruise submerged and then suddenly surface to hit companies 
using the technology with royalty charges. 
  A 20-year limit on the validity of patents from the time of 
application would minimize ``submarine'' patents, Japanese 
officials say. 
<H5>  Disclosure pressed </H5>
  On another point, Japanese officials are pressing for 
quicker 
U.S. disclosure on pending patents. 
  The United States now discloses no information on 
applications until a patent is officially awarded, on the 
premise of protecting the inventor's interests. This means, 
however, other parties may not be able to find out whether a 
patent is being sought for a certain technology. 
  In Japan and Europe, patent information is disclosed 18 
months after the filing of an application. 
  The United States has put a great emphasis on protecting 
intellectual-property rights. It excels in the development of 
intellectual property. In the intellectual-property category, 
which includes patent and copyright payments, the United States 
has by far the biggest surplus in world trade--about $13 billion 
in 1991.

  [Text] It was only several years ago that fullerenes were 
confirmed to be a natural form of carbon, like graphite and 
diamond. But already these soccer ball-shaped carbon cages, 
incorporating 60 or 70 carbon atoms, have become the subject of 
application research. 
  If a recent Tokyo symposium is any guide, both the chemical 
industry and the semiconductor industry could one day be 
transformed by the ideas now coming out of research labs. 
  A group from Hokkaido University has confirmed that the 
fullerene can be modified to act as catalysts to promote 
chemical reactions between organic compounds. Combined with 
alkali metals, the fullerenes in some cases work better than 
platinum as a catalyst, the group reports. 
  In one experiment, they attached six atoms of cesium to 
carbon-70, and then evaluated the ability of this complex to 
facilitate the synthesis of compounds containing hydrogen and 
tritium--a standard test for catalytic activity. The results 
showed the fullerene complex to be around ten times more 
effective than a platinum catalyst, which is one of the most 
active catalysts known. 
  In another experiment with more direct industrial relevance, 
the fullerene complex was able to promote the synthesis of 
ethylene and propylene from ethane and propane at a low 
temperature of 200 C, or 30 C below that required with a 
platinum catalyst. 
  But catalysts are not the only potential application for 
fullerenes. Groups from the University of Tsukuba, Kyoto 
University, the Tokyo Metropolitan University and various other 
places are attempting to synthesize super polymers of carbon-60 
in the hopes of developing new types of plastics and electronic 
materials. The work is still at the basic research stage, though. 
  It is not necessary to link fullerene into giant polymers to 
exploit the material's electric properties. Toshiba Corp. has 
fabricated a polymer film incorporating carbon-60 which can 
convert light energy into electric energy. The company views 
this as a step toward the development of new photographic and 
memory storage media. 
  Meanwhile, a group at Shizuoka University is developing 
equipment to mass-produce fullerenes. The standard method now is 
to pass a current between two carbon electrodes, and then scrape 
off the fullerenes which form as a result. But this method 
cannot be run continuously, and produces only small quantities 
of fullerenes. In the method being developed by the Shizuoka 
University group, fine powdered carbon is supplied to a single 
carbon electrode.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Silver(Ag), was evaporated in argon(Ar) and xenon(Xe) gases 
at various pressures in the low gravity aboard the space 
shuttle. Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50g of 
silver, were filled with argon of 50 Torr(A), 300 Torr(B) and Xe 
gas of 5 Torr(C), 100 Torr(D), respectively, and ignited one by 
one in the low gravitational field of space. The evaporation 
temperatures were maintained at 1150 degrees Celsius at which 
the exhaust gases were barely detectable in all cases for the 
ground experiment. The smoke appeared as a ball of smoke 
particles growing around the evaporation source instead of 
rising as it would under Earth gravity. It could hardly be seen 
for (A), but it was observable for (B) and (C) and there were 
bursts of smoke gushing out from (D) in various directions. The 
experiment suggested the vapor could be confined locally around 
the source with high pressure and temperature by the surrounding 
gas in the low gravity. This suggestion cannot be interpreted by 
any conventional model of evaporation in the gas. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  ``Evaporation of materials in the gas atmosphere'' is a 
technique for producing ultra-fine particles by evaporating 
materials in an inert gas under atmospheric pressure [1] and has 
been used in various fields of science and industry. But far 
less attention has been given to the investigation of the 
process of evaporation of materials in a gas atmosphere than to 
that of the process of evaporation in a vacuum. This is mainly 
due to the fact that each evaporation process in a gravitational 
field is accompanied by the convection of gas, rendering 
analysis of the process difficult. 
  The evaporation of materials in gas is a very ordinary 
phenomenon, seen in such natural phenomena as the evaporation of 
water on the surface of the sea and in boiling water and such 
industrial applications as in smelters, fractional distillation, 
distillation, etc. However, evaporation by heating in a gas on 
the ground is always accompanied by convection and subsidence, 
which are complicated phenomena in themselves. This makes it 
difficult to duly grasp facts in the experiment. 
  Fonda [2] has proposed an empirical evaporation formula of 
tungsten filament in an incandescent lamp bulb, where he assumed 
a stagnation layer of flow on the evaporating surface (Langmuir 
sheath) and that the evaporation rate was to be controlled by 
the diffusion velocity in this layer. This concept was 
originated by Langmuir and has been used for the analysis of 
those kinds of problems up to the present time [3,4]. The 
thicknesses of these layers are not deducible theoretically, but 
they are estimated to be within the range of millimeters of the 
actual evaporation rate on the ground. For the gas evaporation 
under low gravity conditions, the thickness of the stagnation 
layer is as large as the distance from the evaporation source to 
the inner surface of the vessel, it is in the order of ten 
centimeters which is ten squared times as thick as the one for 
the ground experiment. It means the evaporation rate is too 
suppressed to deposit a smoke consisting of fine particles in 
the low gravity especially in evaporation of gas at high 
density; the real situation is to be discovered by the low 
gravity experiment. 
<H5>  Outline of Flight Experiment </H5>
  An experimental metal particle generation device was used in 
the experiment (Fig. 1). 
  Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50 mg of Ag, 
were 
filled with Ar gas of 50 Torr, 300 Torr and Xe gas of 5 Torr, 
100 Torr and were ignited one by one in a low gravitational 
field in space. The pictures of the developing smoke were 
recorded on VTR and brought back with the used bulbs to the 
laboratory on the ground (Fig. 2, not reproduced). These bulbs 
will be cut open and the deposited particles to be examined 
under electron microscope.

<H5>  Results </H5>
  All four bulbs worked, and the heating temperature was kept 
well within the lower constant of 1110 to 1150 degrees Celsius, 
which temperature was too low to develop smoke under Earth 
surface conditions. The heating temperature of the bulb (D) was 
also kept the same for four seconds at the beginning of 
evaporation, but it rose to over 1200 degrees Celsius, and the 
filament blew out in two minutes. The recorded pictures of smoke 
are very dark for the bulb (A), and no smoke can be observed; 
however, for the bulbs (B), (C) and (D) smoke balls appear 
around the filament. These are spherical in shape and consist of 
particles which developed around the evaporation source instead 
of rising as convection smoke. The brightness of (B), (C), (D) 
was seen to increase consecutively (Fig. 2). Especially in the 
case of (D), a few branches of smoke burst out in various 
directions at 1,100 degrees Celsius. This smoke burst was 
expected in this experiment (Fig. 3, not reproduced). 
  Fine particles of uniform size from 20 nm top 50 nm were 
found deposited on the inside walls of the bulbs (A),(B) and 
(C), but in the bulb (D) the particles of Ag were widely 
distributed in size from 20 nm to 10 mm with clear habit. 
<H5>  Observations </H5>
  The conventional idea of evaporation in gas is that a 
``Langmuir sheath,'' a sheath of certain gas molecules, which is 
not affected by convection, exists on the surface of the 
evaporation source and vapor molecules are supposed to be moving 
there through diffusion. 
  As a boundary condition, the saturation vapor pressure of 
the 
temperature of evaporation source is assumed and, on the 
external surface of the sheath, the vapor pressure is assumed to 
be 0. The diffusion speed calculated on the basis of these 
assumptions is considered to be the evaporation speed. 
  The diffusion speed is decided by the thickness of this 
diffusion sheath. Actually, the thickness of this sheath is 
decided by the condition of convection, but it is difficult to 
generally predict the thickness. In reality, there is no other 
way than estimating the thickness from the results. Under 
conditions of low gravity or when there is no convection, the 
whole inside of the vessel is the diffusion sheath. So, the 
thickness becomes overwhelmingly larger compared to a case in 
which there is convection. This theoretically reduces the 
diffusion speed to an extremely low level, almost stopping 
evaporation. The results of the experiment, however, differ 
largely from such a surmise. In either case, evaporation of the 
sample silver was observed and smoke of particulates was 
generated. 
  In an experiment ball (D), in which Xe gas with a large 
atomic weight was enclosed under high pressure of 100 Torr, the 
smoke ball became unstable and smoke was observed gushing out 
through many points. This phenomenon cannot be explained at all 
with the conventional theory that evaporation is the diffusion 
of vapor. 
  In this experiment, one experiment ball was used per 
parameter. However, preliminary experiments conducted so far, 
using drop capsule and airplanes [6-9], guarantee that the 
observed phenomenon is not accidental. It is significant that 
the phenomenon, observed in the preliminary experiments, was 
also observed this time under long time stable conditions with 
the lowest gravity. 
  To explain this fact, this writer and others have proposed a 
new model for evaporation in gas.[5] In this model, evaporation 
is not considered to be simple diffusion. It is considered that, 
as in the case of vacuum evaporation, evaporation is caused by 
the spontaneous emission of vapor atoms from an evaporation 
source. 
  Emitted atoms reach the wall as they are in vacuum. In a 
gas, 
the atoms collide with the gas, are scattered and mix with the 
gas. Then the atoms spread inside the vessel through scattering. 
  When the emission speed is greater than the diffusion speed, 
the difference stays somewhere in space and constitutes a part 
with high vapor density. The higher the gas pressure and the 
larger the atomic weight, the slower the diffusion speed of 
vapor becomes, raising the density of vapor that stays in space. 
This idea is explained with the following equation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-04A>           Formula </FIG>



  D,p and J respectively show diffusion coefficient, vapor 
density and emission atom flow. By solving this equation, the 
vapor density distribution as shown in Fig. 4 obtained. This 
example suggests the possibility of forming of a part of 
saturation vapor. Its supersaturation degree tends to rise as 
gas pressure and the mass number of atoms are increased. It is 
considered that the instability of the smoke interface and the 
gushing of smoke as observed in the experiment ball (D) are 
caused by the vapor pressure when it surpasses gas pressure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-04B>           Fig. 4. Calculated vapor density distributions </FIG>




  Likewise, heat is considered to concentrate near the 
evaporation source in the state of low gravity without 
convection. The relationship between abnormally a high filament 
temperature of smoke and its premature snapping in the 
experiment ball (D) is being analyzed by opening the experiment 
ball. 
  This report does not touch on the particles that were 
generated as they are now being analyzed. However, we report 
here that ultrafine particles of silver with a good 
homogeneousness of almost 20 nm were obtained from the 
experiment ball (A),(B),(C).

  [Text] Kobe Steel, Ltd. has developed, together with 
Menzolit GmbH of Germany, a process to produce unique 
glassfiber-reinforced molded products having better appearance 
and processability. Trial production is now being carried out on 
the site of a Menzolit factory in Germany. 
  Kobe Steel and Menzolit have been in a tie-up since 1990 for 
development of resin molding processes and related technology 
mainly for auto parts. The German firm has been committed to 
developing an intermediate material and the Japanese firm, a 
heat-applied molding process, to complete the new process. 
  The intermediate material is in the form of a 
cylinder--measuring 20cm in diameter and 15cm in length--made 
from thermo-plastic resin powder such as polypropylene and from 
glassfiber (6-25mm in length). The material is press-molded 
(extruded) in an atmosphere of inert gas at the temperature 
which is the melting point of the resin used. 
  The new extruder can heat the material uniformly so as not 
to 
deteriorate the resin on heating and not to break the 
reinforcing fiber. Molding products made in this way are said to 
have better appearance. This process is claimed to be most 
suitable for producing parts with complex shapes and of uniform 
strength.

<H5>  Part I </H5>
  The relationship between nuclear technology and materials 
research can be roughly divided into two phases: (1) furnace 
engineering research dealing with materials for use in nuclear 
reactors and nuclear fuel facilities, and (2) structural 
studies, analysis, and modification of materials in general 
using radiation. 
  In commercial reactors, the system structure, apart from the 
core of the reactor itself, is based on materials technologies 
developed by the traditional industrial infrastructure for 
heating boilers and shipbuilding, which is sustained by steel 
technology. In contrast, the materials used in the reactor core 
are so-called "tailored alloys," such as zircaloy for 
water-cooled reactors, and magnox for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled 
reactors. These materials are advantageous for fission 
maintenance from the standpoint of neutron economy, and meet 
soundness and safety requirements. They were developed at a 
relatively early stage, and have produced good results. These 
two methods of materials development are suggestive for future 
materials research. This article describes the current stage of 
the category "basic technology research" among the research 
activities of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute 
(JAERI). An outline of project-related research (further 
discussed in Part II (1) and (2)) will be included to indicate 
its relationship to the other categories. 
<H5>  1. History of Materials Research </H5>
  Materials research in the early 1960s, the initial stage of 
nuclear engineering in Japan, began with an evaluation of the 
appropriateness of aluminum, which was used as a fuel cladding 
material for the research reactor JRR-3 (the first national 
reactor). This evaluation consisted primarily of property and 
performance qualification testing for carbonic-acid-gas-cooled 
reactors, and materials research for semi-homogeneous reactors. 
Compared to other fields of nuclear research, materials research 
at that time did not differ radically from materials research in 
general engineering fields, which primarily involved basic 
research on radiation effects and corrosion. During the latter 
half of the 1960s, the examination of materials began at JAERI 
along with the introduction of the light-water reactor, and the 
development of the high-speed test reactor. The Japan Materials 
Testing Reactor (JMTR) also began operation, and industry 
finally became involved in irradiation testing for steel and in 
other kinds of testing. Around this time, the research style 
shifted to the so-called project base. (Research related to 
high-speed reactors was soon transferred to the Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC).) 
  About 1970, the issue of pressure wall damage, which was 
being analyzed for the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR), 
had an international impact on research on environment-promoted 
cracking, such as corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion 
cracking, which is closely related to structural safety. 
Research on high-temperature structural materials corresponding 
to the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project began in the 
latter half of the 1970s. In the 1980s, various research 
projects -- including fuel cycle back-end technology -- such as 
fusion reactor materials, fuel reprocessing, and waste 
treatment, based on international cooperation, were added one 
after another, and materials research and development finally 
became systematic. Since the latter half of the 1980s, when 
full-scale research on fusion reactor materials began, 
activities to secure intense neutron sources in the high-energy 
range -- reflecting the need for high neutron flux irradiation 
beds, and high-performance post-irradiation test facilities -- 
have been stressed and introduced. 
  Meanwhile, research and development on organic materials, 
such as polymers, conducted mainly at the Takasaki Radiation 
Chemistry Research Establishment, played an important role in 
the industrial application of irradiation by gamma rays and 
electron beams. In the latter half of the 1980s, large-scale ion 
accelerating facilities were constructed, and materials research 
in many fields, including nonnuclear fields, began. These 
efforts were aimed primarily at advanced applications for 
radioactivity based on beam use. 
<H3>  (1) Reliability of Nuclear System and Introduction of 
Technology </H3>
  As this historical account indicates, there is an urgent 
need 
to test the adaptability and durability of the materials 
selected during the design of systems with definite concepts 
during the period of technological introduction. It is important 
to implement a highly efficient property analysis of a project 
type. At the same time, attempts to create and to find 
applications for materials beyond the framework of the existing 
standards are considered premature. Therefore, the following 
should be stressed first: 
  [1] Testing and verification of system adaptability and 
durability (maintenance base). 
  As soon as the period of independent development arrives, 
the 
following is necessarily required: 
  [2] Creation and application of materials that exceed the 
current systems in performance and functions. 
  While both methods [1] and [2] are aimed at "reliability 
improvement," the decisive difference is that, with method [2], 
the process of creating materials precedes in the material 
formation stage according to a specific purpose. The situation 
there is either that required performance level exceeds the 
limits of the existing materials, or that the concept itself 
does not exist. In order to cope with such situations, neither 
project-type research to directly meet specific needs, nor basic 
research to return to general principles is appropriate. It is 
necessary to design a new approach from a different dimension to 
allow both creativity and finality. This is a problem that is 
peculiar to this age, where nuclear energy has become a reality. 
The International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Engineering 
Research, which took place in spring of last year, recognized 
this problem, and focused on the directions and roles of 
materials science. 
<H3>  (2) Correspondence to Increasingly Diverse and Advance 
Requirements </H3>
  When the industrial base, the resource situation, and the 
nuclear properties of reactors from the light-water reactor to 
the fusion reactor are considered, most of the materials they 
comprise are general-purpose materials, such as steel, and these 
will continue to improve in quality. Therefore, research on new 
materials is not the sole objective of nuclear materials 
development. 
  However, it is certain that thermal conditions -- such as 
temperature and thermal flux (thermal gradient) -- and radiation 
field conditions -- such as spectrum and the intensity of 
neutrons in charge of energy conversion reactions -- will become 
more rigid. This problem can be solved either by new materials, 
or by a combination of materials with added features, in 
designing and device technology. Selection of the two must 
always be considered in research strategies. 
  Table I-1 is a summary of the major reactor types introduced 
in Japan, focusing on durability and reliability in relation to 
their operational environment. Requirements for individual 
systems are varied, and newer systems have more advanced 
requirements. With regard to structural materials, for instance, 
research on a considerable scale is necessary to respond 
properly to the various engineering issues. Therefore, an 
expansion of the testing research matrix for behavior analysis 
and evaluation is unavoidable when various materials, including 
functional materials, and various operating conditions, such as 
stationary, anomalous, and accident conditions, are considered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In implementing projects to break through the existing 
concepts, it is necessary to consider realistic factors, and to 
evaluate the feasibility of spinning off such technology to 
nonnuclear fields. This is because, in the case of specialized 
materials that can be used only for nuclear technology, 
requisite human and material resources may not be derived solely 
through calculation. Many general-purpose materials that are 
used in the nuclear field are supported by an important economic 
factor. The quality and production base of these materials are 
maintained by stable and enormous commercial needs. It is 
necessary to realize that such an infrastructure cannot be 
formed in a short time even with a large investment. Another 
problem is that it is quite common in the development of 
innovative systems for design concepts to change frequently. 
This may contradict the process of material development, which 
requires a long lead time. Material research related to advanced 
system development needs to be guided by precise strategies 
built on a thorough examination of such issues. 
<H3>  2. Stronger Technology Base for Nuclear Development and 
Materials Research (Items of Importance in Long-Term Plan for 
Nuclear Development and Use in FY 1987) </H3>
  Prior to implementation of the plan, four important areas 
that required a stronger technology base were designated by the 
Atomic Energy Commission, and survey activities by special 
committees began. The following is a summary of the results of 
the survey. 
<H3>  (1) Creative Development of Advanced Technology 
(Breakthrough) </H3>
  The guideline for the long-term plan is based on the idea 
that there are three research stages: conventional research and 
development driven by needs, the current efforts to achieve 
breakthroughs, and future development. In order to follow this 
guideline, switching to so-called "seeds-leading" research and 
development based on the creation of basic fields is to be 
implemented. 
  The difference between an emphasis on basic research in 
general and this stronger technology base is that the latter has 
the clear mission to respond to social and economic needs in a 
concrete manner through nuclear development as an energy 
technology. That is to say the basic research envisaged here is 
intended to bridge traditional or pure basic research, and 
project research. It can be understood as research on a key 
technology for broad applicability, or as research on a common 
technology. 
  Some of the concepts examined at the planning stage were: 
  1) Creativity (breakthrough and the technological lead). 
  2) Contribution to nonnuclear fields as well (spin-off 
effects). 
  3) Collaboration among industry, academic bodies, and the 
government. 
  In terms of policy, it is intended to produce a core for 
technological innovation based on 30 years of past experience, 
with the premise that human and material resources would be 
restricted. 
<H5>  (2) Survey Results -- Struggle with Radiation Environment </H5>
  Among the survey activities, which were conducted over a 
period of about six months, was a questionnaire that was 
distributed to nuclear-related organizations, national 
institutes, universities, and private enterprises. Research 
topics were solicited under the condition that those who made 
proposals had priority for their implementation. It produced 
over 150 items over a broad range. Figure I-1 indicates the 
results in several categories. According to the results, 
materials to be studied should not remain in conventionally 
mainstream metals, and should cover a broad range of 
possibilities, including organic and inorganic materials. It 
suggests the consideration of technological spin-off to other 
fields, long terms for implementation, and dependence on 
large-scale facilities. In the section on "Form of 
Implementation," there is no indication of incestuousness, while 
there is the expectation of cooperation and interchange to 
acquire a broad range of knowledge. 



  Further, the technological contents of the proposals have 
been systematically classified in detail with some additional 
items to consider. Figure I-2 divides research activities into 
two conventional types: activities to produce materials, and 
activities to apply them by studying their properties. The items 
classified in the second category indicate that the overwhelming 
number of proposals concern the achievement and improvement of 
radiation tolerance, or the reduction of radiation. It has been 
considered that solving problems related to neutrons, among 
others, is the key to the next step, and to the point of 
breakthrough. 



  It is necessary to prepare the answers to the following 
questions: What properties from the standpoint of materials 
science do materials with tolerance to neutron irradiation have, 
and how should they be produced? What means are necessary to 
determine their behavior during their actual use? How should the 
results of such research and development be used for system 
design as well as safety and reliability? 
<H5>  3. Research Implementation and Progress </H5>
  Based on these principles as set out by the government, 
individual research organizations made implementation plans, 
and, with approval for the organization budget, and so on, began 
to execute them in 1988. The major research projects sponsored 
by JAERI already had included the development of materials for 
fusion and high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and newly 
undertaken basic research included some projects that partly 
supported and complemented them from the standpoint of key 
technologies. Figure I-3 illustrates its structure. It relates 
to the projects more or less directly in terms of long-term 
behavior testing and demonstration, as well as databases. The 
following is an outline of its history. 



<H5>  (1) Project Supporting Research </H5>
  The current status of nuclear fusion, and of the 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, is introduced in Part II 
(1) and (2). 
  Research and development of fusion reactor materials began 
in 
the second half of the 1970s for structural materials, and 
developed into a full-scale activity in 1983 with the 
cooperation of the United States. At present, it has broadened 
to include tritium breeding materials and insulation ceramics, 
and has been conducted actively with the cooperation of many 
nations within the framework of the IEA agreement. 
  Development of materials under the high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactor project began in 1971, and proceeded all 
other activities, such as test method development, materials 
development, tolerance behavior study, tolerance testing in the 
real-machine approximation environment, and database 
development. The major structural materials for the 
High-Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) now under construction are 
those developed in the project. 
<H5>  (2) Material Tolerance Forecast and Database </H5>
  Crucial to the technological base necessary to forecast and 
extend the life of nuclear power plants are a quantitative 
method for forecasting the tolerance of the constituent 
materials, and a database to support it. 
  Assuring the tolerance of the constituent materials requires 
not only experience, but also the ability to forecast life 
expectancy and behavior built on the mechanism of materials 
deterioration. Examples of the systematic development of testing 
methods, equipment, and database systems are introduced in Part 
III. Development of life expectancy evaluation technologies for 
materials tolerance for nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, an 
example in the section, can be considered one of the technology 
bases for commercial plants. Development of the database, which 
is particularly important as a key technology, began with the 
analysis of crack propagation in pressure vessels for light 
water reactors. At present, work on the JAERI Material 
Performance Database (JMPD), which has made it possible to 
achieve computer control and use of tolerance test data of 
materials in real conditions for various new reactors, and on a 
data highway system among organizations, which will lead to 
general use of the former, are in progress. 
<H5>  (3) Design and Development of New Materials </H5>
  The performance of materials subjected to radiation is often 
determined by factors that are fundamentally different from 
those for materials put to more general uses. A typical example 
is the radiation tolerance of ceramic materials. This is related 
both to fundamental solid state properties, and to factors 
related to the production process. 
  A material design process that raises fundamental issues 
related to the atomic and molecular structures of materials, and 
that uses such methods as molecular dynamics and computer 
simulation, is a symbolic process for basic research on nuclear 
materials. In addition, there have been efforts to create new 
materials with highly controlled composites, purity, and 
structures using totally different compound processes, and to 
find breakthroughs and new possibilities. The current status of, 
and future perspectives for such efforts are introduced in Parts 
IV, V and VI. 
<H3>  (4) Development of Innovative Testing Facilities and Testing 
Technology </H3>
  In conventional research, the use of radiation beds has been 
restricted mainly to nuclear reactor neutrons, gamma rays from 
radioisotopes, and electrons. Although these will remain 
important in future, there are fatal restrictions in terms of 
their radioactive energy, intensity, and irradiation 
operability. Therefore, solutions to such problems are of 
primary importance in implementing highly innovative research 
projects. 
  With regard to neutrons, JAERI has proposed an Energy 
Selective Neutron Irradiation Test Facility (ESNIT). This would 
involve creating nuclear reactions using accelerated deuterons, 
and liquid lithium as an energy-variable intense neutron source. 
This proposal attracted international attention, and a 
technological examination was conducted based on international 
cooperation. 
  Meanwhile, various radiation, and heavy and light ion 
accelerating facilities were constructed intensively. These 
facilities made it possible to conduct single, double, and 
triple simultaneous irradiation, which in turn facilitated 
materials improvement and behavior study. The concept and 
structure of such methods, as well as the current status and 
prospects for research and development based on their use, are 
introduced in Parts VII (1) and V. 
  Micro-test-piece testing technology is a development method 
that is intended to overcome restrictions on the test volume 
(the size of irradiation field) specific to the neutron and ion 
beam irradiation experiment facilities mentioned above. This 
also may be applied to general use. The results of integrated 
development as a key technology, including remote control 
technology, are described in Part VII (2). 
<H5>  4. Perspective and Conclusion </H5>
  Macroscopically speaking, most materials research and 
development involve activities that belong inherently to key 
technology research. However, the significance of emphasizing 
key technology is due to a recognition that nuclear development, 
including the role of materials in nuclear technology, is at a 
turning point. 
  It is difficult to summarize our activities and experience 
over the past five years. It is a subtlety of technological 
research that slight changes of intellectual perspective 
sometimes sparks a new burst of creativity, or that a relatively 
small but continuous budget activates research and produces 
efficient results. Fortunately, in FY 1992 the Evaluation 
Committee of the Science and Technology Agency showed us a 
sufficient understanding, which encouraged everyone concerned. 
  In the future, the formation of a material base in general 
will be developed in the areas listed in Table I-2. One of the 
remaining issues will be the proper revision, discontinuation, 
and development of themes as research progresses. At the same 
time, it is necessary to implement technology transfer to 
projects reflecting this principle. This involves nurturing the 
seeds of creativity, and maintaining an active network of 
research organizations. Struggling with such a dilemma is the 
fate of pioneer research, which must be implemented with limited 
resources, including human resources, and which must display a 
high level of intuition and efficiency.

<H5>  Part II </H5>
  The high-temperature gas-cooled rector (HTGR) is a 
helium-gas-cooled, graphite-moderated thermal neutron reactor. 
The HTGR has a number of superb features, including safety, high 
thermal efficiency, and nuclear heat use. Both the Fort St. 
Vrain Reactor, a prototype reactor for power generation in the 
United States, and the THTR-300, a thorium high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactor in Germany, have ceased operations for 
financial and other reasons. However, in addition to these two 
nations, development plans for high-temperature, gas-cooled 
reactors are underway in such nations as China, Russia, and 
Indonesia. 
  In Japan, the high-temperature engineering test reactor 
(HTTR) is under construction at JAERI's Oarai Research 
Establishment, and is expected to come on line in 1998. Figure 
II (2)-1 is a simplified diagram of the HTTR, and Table II (2)-1 
summarizes its specifications. As the table illustrates, its 
operating temperature is higher than that of conventional power 
reactors, and, therefore, it has been necessary to develop 
high-temperature materials. In this section, we will discuss the 
development and testing of graphite (carbon) materials to 
constitute the core section of the HTTR, the intermediate heat 
exchanger, heat-proof alloys for the control rod structure, and 
low alloy steels for the pressure vessel, all of which must 
operate in a higher temperature range than in the case of 
light-water reactors.

the moderator and the reflector of the HTTR. For instance, it is 
used in the graphite fuel sleeves, the hexagonal fuel assembly 
blocks to load the sleeves, the mobile reflector blocks, and in 
the fixed reflector blocks. These components are equipped with 
nuclear and thermal capabilities, and are also structural 
elements. Figure II (2)-2 is a diagram of the core section 
components. The core supporting graphite structure consists of 
fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum blocks, and a 
supporting post, as illustrated in Figure II (2)-1. 



  Although the fuel sleeves and the fuel assembly block of the 
core graphite structure are replaced every two years, their 
operational temperature, and their level of neutron irradiation 
become high because they are in direct contact with the fuel. 
Therefore, at the time of operation and shutdown, a sufficient 
safety allowance is necessary considering the stress generated 
in these components. Evaluation of the stress requires such data 
as Young's modulus of elasticity, strength, thermal expansion 
coefficient, and thermal conductivity in particular. 
Characteristics particular to graphite include dimensional 
changes and creep caused by irradiation. 
  Based on data about a number of characteristics including 
the 
items noted above, selection testing was conducted on several 
types of candidate graphite materials from Japan and overseas to 
be used for the HTTR. IG-110 graphite was selected for the core 
graphite structure. This graphite was originally manufactured as 
a regular material for various uses, such as particles produced 
by the rubber press method for pots in which to melt 
semiconductors. Prior to its use in the HTTR, JAERI and other 
Japanese organizations developed a database for its physical, 
chemical, and mechanical properties, including irradiation 
effects, and conducted research and development on the 
manufacturing side. This involved, for example, increasing the 
size of the material, and improving quality control. The plan 
for the graphite structure of the HTTR is based on this database. 
  The critical factor for a graphite material to be used in a 
nuclear reactor for the first time is the effect of radiation on 
it. The data needed to evaluate its soundness in the reactor 
environment -- including dimensional changes caused by 
radiation, thermal conductivity, corrosion speed, Young's 
modulus of elasticity, and strength -- were studied for a range 
of radiation temperature from 400-1200ÎC, and a maximum 
radiation exposure of 3x10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E &gt; 
29 fJ). 
  With regard to the effects of radiation, creep caused by 
radiation is an important characteristic of graphite used in 
nuclear reactors. A creep phenomenon can be observed in graphite 
irradiated at low temperatures, where thermal creep does not 
occur. As thermal stress is relaxed by this phenomenon, 
understanding creep behavior is an important element in 
evaluating the soundness of the graphite structure. 
  In order to measure the creep factor of the selected IG-110 
graphite under irradiation, JAERI developed an irradiation 
capsule that is capable of irradiating a graphite test piece 
under stretch stress, and conducted an irradiation test at the 
JMTR. Figure II (2)-3 illustrates the results, showing 
irradiation creep factors (K) in comparison with various 
graphite samples. The results indicate that IG-110 graphite has 
the same characteristics as other types of graphite studied 
overseas. Here (K) can be calculated by the following equation 
from the data on irradiation creep distortion _e_ c 
in the case of a relatively high level of irradiation: 
  _e_[.sup]c[/] = _s_/E[.sub]O[/] 
+ K_s_Ì 
  _s_: load stress, E[.sup]O[/]: Young's modulus 
of elasticity, Ì: neutron irradiation dose 



  Part of the irradiation creep research at JAERI has been 
conducted within the framework of the high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactor research collaboration between JAERI and the 
U.S. Department of Energy. American graphite has been used for 
irradiation. Establishment of a general model for creep damage 
for international use has been set as a future goal. 
<H5>  (2) Core Support Graphite </H5>
  The graphite core support structure is a permanent structure 
that consists of fixed reflector blocks, high-temperature plenum 
blocks, plenum lower blocks, low-end blocks (PGX graphite made 
by UCAR of the United States is used for these items), a 
supporting post for the core section (made of IG 110 graphite), 
and carbon blocks for insulation (made of ASR-ORB carbon made by 
SIGRI of Germany). 
  PGX graphite was selected not only on the basis of an 
evaluation of its various characteristics, but also because it 
can be manufactured in sufficient quantities, a stable supply 
situation, its record of use (at the Fort St. Vrain Reactor 
reactors), and its price. For PGX graphite, the data necessary 
to produce the core support graphite design plan were obtained 
as in the case of IG 110 graphite. 
  ASR-ORB carbon for insulation was considered suitable due to 
its material size, low thermal transmission factor (about 10 
W/mK), and such data as measurement stability under compression 
stress. It was confirmed that the measurement change was at most 
0.1 percent at 1,000ÎC with a compression stress of 0.3 MPa 
loaded to reflect real conditions. It was also verified that the 
thermal transmission factor remained almost the same at 
1,000ÎC for a long time. 
<H5>  (3) Future Research Items </H5>
  The supporting post, which is a permanent structure, is 
important for safety as its function is to support the reactor 
core. Evaluation of its durability against erosion caused by 
gaseous impurities in the helium coolant has been conducted in 
testing and analysis, and to improve corrosion tolerance, 
research on the gradient materials constituting SiC has been 
conducted. Experimental production at JAERI is based on chemical 
reactions using SiO. 
  SiO (gas) + 2C (graphite) SiC + CO 
  At present, the corrosion behavior and strength 
characteristics of IG-110 graphite made of SiC gradient 
constituents produced by this method are under study. Figure II 
(2)-4 is an example of one set of results. It indicates that the 
corrosion resistance of SiC gradient constituent graphite is 
improved when maintained in the atmosphere at 550ÎC. In 
addition, work on the development of high-performance materials 
also has been conducted using compound carbon materials 
reinforced with carbon fibers. Also, the development of 
high-intensity and high-temperature conductive materials, the 
production of experimental equipment elements, and the 
acquisition of irradiation data are in progress with a view to 
applications in nuclear fusion reactors. 



  With regard to inspection technologies, a method for 
infrared 
radiation measurement is being studied. This is in addition to 
the supersonic method and the regenerative method used for 
acceptance inspections of HTTR graphite. With regard to design 
methods, improved and advanced research, such as adding the 
fracture mechanics method to brittle material structure design, 
is expected in future. 
<H5>  2. Heat-Resistant Alloy </H5>
  The performance required of heat-resistant alloys for HTGRs 
includes maintaining the capabilities of these materials above 
certain standards for a long period of time in the unique 
environment of nuclear reactors. This is in addition to the 
common performance requirements of general thermochemical 
materials. Although there has been significant progress in the 
development of heat-resistant alloys in recent years, we have 
almost no experience in using massive amounts of heat-resistance 
alloy in large-scale structures in an ultra-high-temperature 
range over 850ÎC. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a 
new domain that takes into account the specific environment of 
nuclear reactors from the standpoint of both material 
engineering and structural engineering. The specific environment 
of nuclear reactors involves a coolant helium gas atmosphere, 
and neutron irradiation near the core. Although helium gas is 
inherently inactive, and does not react chemically with metal 
materials itself, the helium gas used as a coolant, which passes 
and circulates through the high-temperature core where there is 
a large amount of graphite, includes small amounts of CO, 
CO[.sup]2[/], H[.sub]2[/], H[.sub]2[/]O, and 
CH[.sup]4[/], which are produced by reactions between 
absorbents, such as water and air, and high-temperature 
graphite. Therefore, materials for use in high-temperature 
structures, such as intermediate heat exchangers, must have 
long-term durability in a helium gas atmosphere containing small 
amounts of impurities. Structural materials for control rods 
used near the core must be highly resistant to deterioration 
caused by neutron irradiation. 
<H5>  (1) Materials for High-Temperature Structures in HTTR </H5>
  A maximum coolant temperature of 950ÎC is expected at 
the 
reactor exit of the HTTR. Structural materials for use in 
high-temperature sections, such as the heat-transfer pipe of the 
intermediate heat exchanger, are exposed to coolant helium gas 
with small amounts of impurities at temperatures above 
900ÎC. Maintaining the protective oxide layer reaction is 
more difficult in an atmosphere of coolant helium gas containing 
small amounts of impurities than in a strong oxidizing 
atmosphere like ordinary air. In fact, research indicates that 
many heat-resistant Ni-Cr alloys tend to undergo changes, such 
as internal oxidation and decarburizing, that reflect inferior 
protective properties of the oxide layer. Therefore, structural 
materials for high-temperature sections must be adaptable to 
such an atmosphere. In the HTTR design, the so-called insulated 
double pipe structure is used. In this structure, a coolant 
pressure of 4 MPa is supported by a pressure wall made of low 
alloy steel that is in contact with the returned gas on the 
low-temperature side, while the high-temperature side takes care 
of about 0.1 MPa, the differential pressure with the secondary 
system, without being affected by the direct pressure of the 
coolant. By introducing such design, the primary stress exerted 
on the structural materials for the high-temperature section 
remains below 1 MPa, and the thermal stress is below 40 MPa. 
  The structural material used in the high-temperature section 
in the HTTR is hastelloy X, a nickel-based alloy. It was 
selected from among existing heat-resistant alloys after some 
improvements in adaptability to the atmosphere described above 
were made. The chemical components of the improved alloy, called 
hastelloy XR, are presented in Table II (2)-2, and are compared 
to the standard values for hastelloy X. The improvements made in 
hastelloy XR are as follows: 
  [1] Improved resistance to corrosion in the coolant helium 
gas atmosphere. 


    -  Control of uniform corrosion by a protective 
MnCr[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] spinel oxide layer where the Mn 
content is optimized. 
  -  Improved adhesive properties of the oxide 
layer using SiO[.sup]2[/] granule formation in the phase 
boundary between the oxide layer and the metal by optimizing the 
Si content. 
  -  Control of internal oxidation and intergranular 
corrosion by reducing the amount of Al and Ti. 

    [2] Improved high-temperature strength 


    -  Improved creep characteristics using structural 
improvements such as form control of carbide by optimizing the B 
content. (This was realized after other improvements were made. 
Therefore, the alloy with this improvement may sometimes be 
called hastelloy XR-II to distinguish it from the alloy without 
an optimized B content.) 
  -  Improved creep characteristics using 
separation control of stringer carbide, and unification of grain 
size by optimizing the manufacturing process for seamless 
pipes. 

    [3] Improved nuclear adaptability. 


    -  Control of radiation activation of corrosion products 
by reducing the Co content.

  Reliability, durability, and verification of system safety 
are indispensable when applying newly developed or improved 
materials to systems such as nuclear reactors, which involve 
social risks. Therefore, various tests related to long-term 
durability were conducted for hastelloy XR in an atmosphere 
simulating the primary coolant in a temperature range up to 
1,000ÎC. This made it possible to accumulate considerable 
data and knowledge. In acquiring test data, standard helium gas 
components for materials testing was designated based on 
operational data from high-temperature gas-cooled reactors 
overseas, as illustrated in Table II (2)-3. Next, various pieces 
of equipment, such as a system for supplying and continuously 
circulating the helium gas, a creep testing machine, a fatigue 
testing machine and corrosion testing equipment were developed 
for experiments in the intended atmosphere without changing the 
components of the supplied helium gas. As details of this 
testing equipment have been published in other issues, only some 
examples of test results are presented here.

  [1] Creep and rapture properties 
  With regard to the creep properties of hastelloy XR in 
standard helium gas, data for a total of 5 x 10[.sup]5[/] 
hours have been acquired, including one experiment currently in 
progress over the maximum of 47,000 hours in the range of 
800-1,000ÎC (Figure II (2)-5). Data for a total of 4 x 
10[.sup]5[/] hours have been acquired, including one 
experiment that reached the maximum of about 47,000 hours in the 
same temperature range in the atmosphere. Hastelloy XR has 
improved adaptability to the coolant helium gas atmosphere, and 
the results indicate that there is no significant difference 
between the creep properties in the standard helium gas and 
those in the atmosphere, as the improvements were intended. 



  The creep properties of hastelloy XR, it was discovered, are 
affected by the B content in the alloy, as illustrated in Figure 
II (2)-6. Therefore, the optimized hastelloy XR-II was produced 
twice on an industrial scale (2 tons) to examine long-term creep 
properties in the standard helium gas, and in the atmosphere. 
The extension effect for rapture life time due to optimization 
of the B content proved to be about five times. 



  Further, it was verified that the accumulation law of damage 
could be applied to high-temperature structure designs for 
hastelloy XR by conducting two-step creep tests involving 
changes in temperature and load, as well as creep tests with 
short-term excessive load -- to take earthquakes into account -- 
in addition to creep tests under specific temperatures and loads. 
  In this way, it was demonstrated that hastelloy XR could 
display excellent characteristics for long periods of time in 
the standard helium gas. Its characteristics in helium gas with 
changing amounts of impurities were also examined. It turned out 
that, although its creep rapture properties in carburized helium 
gas were equivalent to those in the standard helium gas, creep 
rapture life time in decarburized helium gas was shorter than 
that in the standard helium gas, and that it was possible to 
forecast decarburizing behavior by regulating the impurities in 
the helium gas through carbon activity, and oxygen partial 
pressure. From the standpoint of maintaining the excellent 
properties of this alloy, as well as ensuring the soundness of 
the structure, it is important to be able to control the coolant 
in nuclear reactors. 
  [2] Properties under fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction 
  Characteristics of low cycle fatigue were examined across a 
broad temperature range from room temperature to 950ÎC. 
Under the standard condition for ordinary materials testing 
(complete alternating distortion fatigue testing by triangular 
waves at a distortion speed of 0.1 percent/second), fatigue life 
time in the standard helium gas was at least as long as that in 
the atmosphere. 
  The effects of both distortion speed and holding distortion 
were examined to evaluate material properties under 
creep-fatigue interaction. It was confirmed in the standard 
helium gas that holding on the extracting side produced the most 
serious effects, and that, as the temperature rose, the 
saturation of life time reduction as a result of introducing 
distortion holding moved toward a shorter life time (Figure II 
(2)-7). In evaluating damage caused by fatigue and creep-fatigue 
interaction based on such data, the principle value for damage 
prevention was designated by restricting the addition of the 
creep damage factor, and the fatigue damage factor under 1. 



  The effects of material change produced by aging on low 
cycle 
fatigue properties were also examined, and it was discovered 
that a reduction of fatigue life time due to aging occurred when 
the test temperature was below 700ÎC. This tendency became 
prominent under conditions of high distortion. 
  [3] Corrosion tolerance 
  To determine its corrosion tolerance in the standard helium 
gas, corrosion testing, where a thermal cycle is added between 
the room temperature and the test temperature, was conducted, 
and data for 30,000 hours at 900ÎC and 20,000 hours at 
1,000ÎC were obtained. The effects of improvements in 
hastelloy XR for corrosion tolerance in the coolant helium gas 
atmosphere were maintained for a long period of time. It was 
also confirmed that partial corrosion did not occur, and that 
progress in dechromation by oxidation took place as predicted by 
the parabolic speed principle (Figure II (2)-8). 



  As illustrated above, sufficient data and knowledge about 
the 
hastelloy XR base material were accumulated through 
comprehensive verification testing. Maintaining the performance 
of the welded section -- an important problem to be solved in 
constructing a structure with metal materials -- was also 
examined. A filler metal for welding was developed in order to 
obtain a stretching ductility, creep rapture strength, creep 
rapture ductility, and fatigue strength equivalent to or greater 
than those of the base material. By optimizing the filler metal 
production process, and by adjusting the chemical components 
through alloy design based on heavy regression analysis, a 
filler metal with a performance far higher than that of 
conventional filler materials was developed. It was confirmed 
that this filler metal sufficiently satisfied the specifications 
for welding sections of the thick structure of 50 to 60mm, which 
was difficult to work on, as well as the thin structure of about 
15mm. Figure II (2)-9 illustrates the results of creep rapture 
testing as an example of its performance. 



  (2) Materials for Control Rod Structure for HTTR 
  Because the coolant temperature at the reactor exit reaches 
a 
maximum of 950ÎC in the HTTR, most parts of the constituent 
elements of the core and reactor structure consist of carbon and 
graphite materials. The metal structure in the reactor is 
designed not to exceed the maximum temperature of the materials. 
This is accomplished by restricting the location of use, or by 
introducing an insulating structure. Heat-resistant materials 
used in the core section are limited to covering pipes for the 
control rod, connecting rods, shock absorbers, etc. In general, 
nickel-based alloys have high levels of heat and corrosion 
resistance, but it has been discovered that they are sensitive 
to the helium stiffening phenomenon, wherein He is created in 
the structure by nuclear transformation reactions between 
thermal neutrons and Ni or B. Therefore, an iron-based alloy, 
800 H, has been used as a control rod structure material for the 
HTTR. 
  When the HTTR is shut down, a two-step insertion method is 
adopted: First, the reactor is made subcritical by inserting a 
control rod into the relatively low-temperature reflector 
domain. Second, the control rod is inserted to the fuel domain 
after the core temperature is reduced to the designated 
temperature. In this way, the temperature of the control rod 
covering pipe is prevented from becoming too high. The 
introduction of this method has made it possible to reduce the 
temperature of the control rod covering pipe to about 400ÎC 
during ordinary operation. However, since the temperature of the 
control rod covering pipe rises to 900ÎC, and because 
thermal stress is generated at the time of reactor scram, the 
creep properties of alloy 800 H after neutron irradiation become 
important. 
  Therefore, the creep rapture properties of alloy 800 H after 
neutron irradiation were examined. For the HTTR, life time of 
the control rod is designed to be five years, and the rod is to 
be replaced when the temperature of the control rod covering 
pipe exceeds 900ÎC. (This occurs when a gas circulator of 
the supplementary cooling facility fails to operate after 
reactor scram due to a loss of commercial power.) Creep rapture 
testing was implemented up to the maximum of 900ÎC to 
simulate irradiation of the material in real conditions 
equivalent to the end of control rod life time (amount of 
thermal neutron radiation: 2.3 x 
10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]), and of the irradiation 
material in accelerated conditions (amount of thermal neutron 
radiation: 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]). Figure II 
(2)-10 illustrates the results of radiation testing designed to 
simulate real conditions. Creep rapture life time of the 
material after neutron irradiation proved to be 10-30 percent 
that of the unradiated material. In this way, neutron radiation 
reduces creep rapture life time, but creep rapture life time 
after irradiation up to 1.2 x 10[.sup]25[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] 
is not significantly different from the data of irradiation to 
2.3 x 10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] in Figure II (2)-10. In 
other words, reduction of creep rapture life time by neutron 
radiation is almost saturated at 2.3 x 
10[.sup]24[/]n/m[.sup]2[/]. 



  The effects of the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the 
primary coolant, and the effects of its aging on the creep 
properties of alloy 800 H, were examined using materials in the 
absence of radiation. It was confirmed that the creep properties 
of the alloy in the simulated helium gas atmosphere of the 
primary coolant are not significantly different from those in 
the ordinary atmosphere, and that the effects of aging could be 
ignored within the range of assumed conditions of use due to the 
fact that the control rod has a shorter designed life time than 
the thermal heat exchangers. Based on these results, the design 
allowance for the stress value was determined using data based 
on atmospheric testing, of which there is a considerable body, 
as well as from separate tests on the effects of neutron 
irradiation. 
<H3>  (3) Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy To Improve Intermediate Heat 
Exchangers </H3>
  One of the characteristics of the HTGR is that its nuclear 
heat will be used directly in industrial processes. Therefore, 
the higher the temperature of the helium gas extracted from the 
reactor, the greater its industrial value. To achieve these 
higher temperatures, it is necessary to further improve the 
performance of the heat-resistance alloy used for the 
high-temperature structure. The development of materials for the 
high-temperature structure of high-temperature gas-cooled 
reactors where the coolant temperatures reaches 1,000ÎC at 
the reactor exit began with a large project directed by the 
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This project, 
entitled "Research and Development of Direct Iron-Making 
Technology Using High-Temperature Reduced Gas," began in 1973, 
and was completed in May 1981. The conclusion was that two types 
of heat-resistant alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, which were capable 
of achieving the goal of a creep rapture life time over 50,000 
hours at 1,000ÎC, were possible candidates for 
ultra-heat-resistant alloys that could be used as 
high-temperature structural materials for high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactors where the coolant temperature reached 
1,000ÎC at the reactor exit. 
  It was decided that these results be adopted and further 
developed by JAERI. Therefore, in 1982 JAERI established the 
Ultra-Heat-Resistant Alloy Special Committee (led by Ryohei 
Tanaka, Professor Emeritus of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) 
consisting of experts from the industrial, governmental, and 
academic sectors in Japan, and pursued ultra-heat-resistant 
alloy development in consultation with the committee. In the 
development program at JAERI, the methods of alloy development 
were examined first. Because the two types of heat-resistant 
alloys, SSS 113 MA and KSN, were both NiCrW-based alloys, it was 
decided to pursue alloy development so as to improve corrosion 
resistance and manufacturing capability as much as possible, 
while increasing high-temperature durability, an advantage of 
this type of alloy. 
  In the development of ultra-heat-resistant alloys, the major 
specifications were set as follows: 
  [1] Creep rapture strength at 1,000ÎC for 1 x 
10[.sup]5[/] hours is to be 9.8 MPa (equivalent to or above 
the development goal for AIST's large project plans). 
  [2] The level of internal oxidation and intergranular 
corrosion is low after heat is applied at 1,000ÎC for 1 x 
10[.sup]5[/] hours in the standard helium gas simulating the 
primary coolant in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors 
(equivalent to or above hastelloy XR). 
  [3] Work on heat transmission pipes (external diameter of 
32mm, thickness of 4-5mm, and length over 7 m) for heat 
exchangers of the reactor is possible. 
  [4] Secondary working and welding needed to produce heat 
exchangers can be done. 
  The goal of this development program was to develop 
ultra-heat-resistant alloys that would satisfy such 
specifications simultaneously, and in a balanced manner. 
  As the first step, because both SSS 113 MA and KSN have a 
composition featuring a boundary where separation of the 
_a_[.sup]2[/]-W phase occurs as illustrated in Figure II 
(2)-11, an examination of the hot working conditions, tractive 
characteristics, creep rapture characteristics, and corrosion 
tolerance in the standard helium gas of alloys in this domain 
was conducted to take advantage of this mechanism to improve 
high-temperature strength by this separation. It was concluded, 
as a result of this examination, that the optimum ratio for a 
NiCrW composite was Ni-18-19 mass% Cr-20-22 
mass%-W. 



  In the second step, hot working conditions, tractive 
characteristics at the approximate time of aging, and creep 
rapture characteristics of the alloy with this optimum NiCrW 
composition, as well as the effects of additional accessory 
elements such as C, Nb, Fe, Mn, Si, B, T, and Ti on corrosion in 
the standard helium gas were examined systematically. Figure II 
(2)-12 illustrates the relationship between the predicted creep 
rapture strength, based on multiple regression analysis between 
creep rapture strength and accessory elements, and extrapolated 
values from the test data among other results obtained in this 
examination process. Forecast values based on multiple 
regression analysis test values coincided well for any 
characteristics as in this example. Based on these results, the 
chemical composition for the new alloy, whose high-temperature 
strength and corrosion resistance would be improved by adding 
small amounts of B and Y, was proposed. Figure II (2)-13 
illustrates the characteristics of both the new alloy and the 
conventional heat-resistant alloys in a semi-quantitative mode. 
It clearly shows that the new alloy developed in this program 
has well-balanced characteristics in terms of high-temperature 
durability. 






  In the third step, this newly developed alloy was made on an 
industrial scale (two tons), which was then used to produce 
seamless pipes to be used as the heat transmission pipes of heat 
exchangers on an experimental basis. It was confirmed that the 
alloy had sufficient properties, in both hot and cold working 
conditions, for the production of seamless pipes. 
  Current plans call for the energetic implementation of the 
following tasks leading to the successful application of the new 
alloy: 
  [1] Research for establishing welding technology, including 
the development of filler metals. 
  [2] Evaluation of the various characteristics of base 
materials and welding sections by tests conducted over long 
periods of time. 
<H5>  3. Low-Alloy Steel Materials for Pressure Vessels </H5>
  Pressure-resistant low alloys are used for the coolant 
pressure boundary (such as copper and pipes for pressure vessels 
and intermediate heat exchangers), and for the core support 
structure (such as support plates) (see Figure II (2)-1). This 
section covers research and development efforts aimed at the 
application of low-alloy steel to pressure vessels, which 
requires the highest degree of reliability. 
<H5>  (1) Use of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel </H5>
  The temperature of the pressure vessel of the HTTR is 
400ÎC during ordinary operation, and it is designed for 
440ÎC considering abnormal situations caused by transient 
changes. Therefore, instead of using Mn-Mo-based SA 533 B steel, 
2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo Steel (JIS SCMV 4-2 ASTMA 387 Gr.22) was adopted, 
although it lacked a record of use in nuclear reactor vessels. 
  The design conditions for the pressure section of the HTTR 
are a temperature of 440ÎC, a pressure of about 4.75 MPa, 
and a radiation level of 1 x 10[.sup]22[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E 
&gt;  0.1 MeV). About 1 x 10[.sup]5[/] hours of operation are 
planned. Because this steel has virtually no established track 
record, it will be necessary how its brittleness characteristics 
are affected by heat, stress, and radiation, as well as forecast 
of material deterioration by evaluating such high-temperature 
characteristics as fatigue. 
  Concerning the production of the material, the normalized 
and 
tempered steel (NT) used for the heat exchangers in fast-breeder 
reactors and chemical plants was adopted instead of annealed 
steel (AN), which was included in the ASME design code. This was 
because (1) NT has good hardening properties, and the 
normalizing and tempering process improves the designed stress 
at high temperatures, and (2) it has a high level of tenacity at 
room temperature or less. Based on the data about the 
relationships among the various brittleness factors noted above 
and the composition, the low-Si and high-purity NT steel was 
considered appropriate. What was taken into consideration is the 
following parameter of so-called temper brittleness: 
  J = (Si + Mn) (P + S) x 10[.sup]4[/] &lt; 100 
  Here, element symbols indicate mass%. It is noted 
that not 
only P and S, but also Si and Mn have large effects. An example 
of the compositions of forged materials is presented in Table II 
(2)-4.

<H5>  (2) Evaluation of Materials Deterioration </H5>
  The suitability of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel for pressure vessels 
was confirmed by evaluating the various brittleness and 
high-temperature characteristics described in (1). With regard 
to brittleness at high-temperatures, for instance, it was 
confirmed that a sufficient level could be maintained after an 
aging process at 450ÎC for over 50,000 hours. Figure II 
(2)-14 illustrates the effect of test temperature on Charpy 
impact strength in the cases of isothermal aging, stress aging, 
and step-cool processing simulating the temperature change for a 
high-purity material (see Table II (2)-4) at 450ÎC for up to 
3,000 hours. The diagram indicates that both ductility 
brittleness transient temperature and upper-shelf energy are not 
affected by such processes. 



<H5>  (3) Recent Research and Future Directions </H5>
  Figure II (2)-15 illustrates the results of recent research 
on the soundness of pressure vessels. The idea was to compare 
the fracture toughness (J[.sup]IC[/]) of the welded metal, 
the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and the base metal after 
irradiation at 450ÎC up to about 1 x 
10[.sup]23[/]n/m[.sup]2[/] (E &gt;  1 MeV) against those not 
subjected to irradiation. The results show that, although HAZ 
shows the lowest J[.sup]IC[/] value before irradiation, there 
is no difference among the welded metal, the heat-affected zone, 
and the base metal after irradiation. 



  Figure II (2)-16 illustrates the interrelationship between 
irradiation embrittlement and thermal embrittlement. In the 
diagram, the vertical axis represents the J[.sup]IC[/] value, 
J[.sup]iep[/] (J value at the start of cracking by the 
potentiometric method), T[.sup]mat[/] (tearing modulus), and 
variation by upper-shelf energy (USE) radiation as functions of 
irradiation temperature. White symbols in the diagram indicate 
samples subjected to thermal aging for 10,000 hours at 
450ÎC. Reduction rates for the values mentioned above become 
smaller for temperatures up to 350ÎC, but they become larger 
at higher temperatures. The trends below 350ÎC are believed 
to correspond to a reduction of radiation hardening as a result 
of increases in the irradiation temperature. 



  In addition to the efforts described above, research to 
evaluate the strength, tenacity, and ductility-brashiness 
transient properties using micro-test-piece technology, and 
electrochemical methods, have been conducted as part of the 
overall program of research and development of an evaluation 
technology for material deterioration.

<H5>  Part III </H5>
<H3>  1. Summary of Evaluation Research on the Durability of 
Materials Used in Nuclear Power Plants </H3>
<H5>  (1) Perspectives of Durability Evaluation Research </H5>
  It is essential to ensure the durability of equipment and 
materials to provide for system safety and economy, and also to 
improve the performance of operational plants such as light 
water reactors and large reprocessing facilities. In the 
development of new plants, such as high-temperature gas-cooled 
reactors and nuclear fusion reactors, the social acceptance and 
expandability of such plants are often governed by the 
durability of structural materials, although achievement of 
performance goals also is necessary. 
  As Figure III-1 illustrates, to achieve a breakthrough in 
materials technology, both durability evaluation and the 
development of new materials are required. Therefore, in 
evaluating the durability of metal structural materials, the 
expansion and generalization of research results have been 
implemented through the comprehensive development of a series of 
research themes, such as deterioration analysis of materials 
used in the target environment, selection and development of 
quantitative and prompt evaluation test methods to predict 
operational life time, and the collection of data on corrosion 
and environmental cracks, together with the development of 
databases on various environmental, material, and dynamic 
parameters. In addition, improving material performance, and the 
development of new materials based on the results of durability 
controlling factor analysis are underway. 



  Figure III-2 illustrates the relationships between 
differences in the durability control factors of nuclear plant 
materials and the use environment, that is, temperature and 
mechanical factors. Since slight modifications of reactor 
engineering design in the development of new types of plants 
affects the conditions of the operational environment, the 
development of evaluation and material production methods having 
a high degree of adaptability are being emphasized as key 
technologies. Because suitable nuclear properties related to 
environment safety in addition to durability will be required of 
structural materials for future plants, as illustrated in Figure 
III-3, the development of elements and nuclides as sources of 
radioactive cladding, improved adhesion in surface tissue and 
corrosion, and the development of criticality safety materials 
for reprocessing equipment are in progress. 






<H5>  (2) Development of Durability Evaluation Methods </H5>
  Corrosion in the nuclear environment -- such as that 
produced 
by high-temperature water, high-temperature helium, and 
reprocessed nitric acid -- can vary drastically due to small 
amounts of impurities and coexistent elements. For this reason, 
efforts are underway to develop and improve durability 
evaluation and analysis methods -- including the generating 
surface and gap that are specific to practical structures, as 
well as environmental changes at the time of accidents -- using 
advanced equipment analysis and environmental management 
technology. Mass transport analysis in the same system as 
corrosion emission elements, which has an important effect on 
system maintenance and control, has been conducted with regard 
to the new environment of high-temperature helium and 
reprocessed nitric acid. Corrosion monitoring technology can be 
used to improve various conventional corrosion sensors used for 
electrochemical measurement, thereby serving as an on-site 
technology that can be adapted to the radioactive environment. 
Another goal is to develop methods appropriate for state 
resolution, such as optical and acoustic measurements. As 
quantitative evaluation methods to assess the extent of 
corrosion or changes in the quality of materials, work on 
activation analysis and fission track analysis using nuclear 
reactor facilities is in progress, in addition to various 
surface analysis and micro analysis technologies. 
<H5>  (3) Analysis of Corrosion Damage Due to Age Deterioration </H5>
  Many nuclear materials are used in radioactive and corrosive 
environments for dozens of years. In such cases there are 
examples of damage due to age deterioration that would not 
appear in general industrial use. The JAERI facilities have 
played an important role in forecast studies for age 
deterioration phenomena. These include a hair-crack analysis of 
JPDR that led to research on stress corrosion cracks (SCC) in 
stainless steel in high-temperature pure water containing 
dissolved oxygen. In recent years, SCC and pitting corrosion at 
temperatures under 60ÎC were discovered on the stainless 
steel pipes of the primary cooling system of a nuclear reactor 
that was over 20 years old. Thus we learned that adequate water 
quality control and materials measures equivalent to those used 
for a high-temperature primary cooling system were necessary. At 
the time of long-term loop operation during a power stoppage for 
"Mutsu," a nuclear vessel, pitting corrosion on coated pipes was 
analyzed. The soundness of the fuel element was ensured by a 
thorough inspection, and by replacing defective components, 
after which the rest of the experimental sail was completed. 
Precious data concerning the generation and growth of partial 
damage produced by the effect of concentrations of very small 
amounts of chlorine in gaps, as well as by copper dissolved from 
the same circuit, were also obtained. An example of pitting 
corrosion that was observed after a long period of service in 
low-temperature pure water is illustrated in Figure III-4. 
Although the actual pitting corrosion depth obtained by 
destructive inspection is deeper than the results obtained from 
measurements using such ordinary methods as a mechanical tracer 
or the optical visual field depth method, there is a certain 
proportional relationship that indicates stable growth between 
aperture diameters. If they are of the same type, the depth of 
pitting corrosion in those for which destructive inspection 
cannot be conducted can be estimated quite accurately. We have 
experienced a number of problems with the materials that are 
used in the current generation of power plants, such as solid 
phase deposition by gas-air separation on the high-temperature 
heating surface of the liquid waste enrichment can, gap 
corrosion and SCC due to alkali concentrations, and the 
accumulation of radioactive crud through the selective elution 
of Co for the stellite hard metals in the high-temperature 
sealing section. Therefore, basic research related to 
operational control and countermeasures to protect materials 
have been implemented. 



<H3>  2. Examples of Forecast Method Development for Materials 
Durability </H3>
  The following is a summary of various studies on 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor heat-resistant alloys, 
reprocessing plant materials, and water-cooled reactor core 
materials conducted by JAERI. All of these studies involved 
issues related to the evaluation of the durability of materials 
used in nuclear plants, as described in the previous chapter. 
<H3>  (1) Long-Term Durability Forecast for Heat-Resistant Alloys 
for High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor </H3>
  As described in Part II, hastelloy XR was developed at JAERI 
as a high-temperature structural material for use in HTTR, and 
various performance evaluation tests related to its soundness 
and long-term durability have been conducted. This section will 
present methods for search testing for age deterioration damage 
modes, which control durability, for the purpose of developing 
rapid evaluation testing methods for assessing long-term 
durability, as well as rapid evaluation testing methods for 
material change due to high-temperature gas and surface 
responses. 
  [1] Search for Age Deterioration Damage Modes That Control 
Durability 
  In determining the high-temperature structure design plan 
for 
the HTTR, assumed damage modes are extracted using the 
characteristics related to materials durability and operational 
conditions. Taking these into consideration, the structure is 
designed so that there is a sufficient safety allowance to 
prevent damage to the materials. However, among the damage modes 
assumed in the design of the HTTR, it was found that the safety 
allowance for creep rapture and creep fatigue rapture was the 
smallest, and that creep property evaluation for extended use 
was important. 
  As described in Part II (2), the creep strength of hastelloy 
XR for relatively short periods of about 1,000 hours can be 
radically improved by adjusting the boron content to 40-60 ppm. 
This improvement is also valid, as illustrated in Figure III-5, 
for creep properties for longer use periods, which is important 
for long-term durability. The figure illustrates the 
relationship between stress and rapture life time for hastelloy 
XR with a low boron content of 10 ppm or less, and for hastelloy 
XR-II at 50 ppm. The comparison is shown using dotted lines and 
full lines, respectively. (Hastelloy XR-II conventionally is 
used to distinguish it from hastelloy XR, which is defined as 
having a boron content of 100 ppm or less.) Compared to 
hastelloy XR, the creep properties of hastelloy XR-II show 
greater improvement at the lower temperature range of 
700-900ÎC, and on the side of low stress and long hours. The 
results indicate the possibility of evaluating long-term 
soundness for creep rapture in structural materials in the real 
equipment environment by setting the boron content at 30 ppm for 
HTTR-specified materials, while using changes in the boron 
content of the alloy by aging as an index. 



  [2] Preliminary Examination of Creep Life Time Evaluation 
Based on Boron in Alloys 
  Since the boron content of the alloy was expected to diffuse 
and deviate from the inside due to surface response, variation 
by aging was measured using heating temperature, environment 
(air and impure helium), and test piece shape as parameters. 
Figure III-6 illustrates the results of measuring variations in 
the boron content of the alloy over time after heating round 
bars with three different diameters (1.6, 6, and 10mm) at 
950ÎC and 1,000ÎC. A prominent reduction in the amount 
of boron can be observed in the 1.6mm diameter round bar heated 
in helium at 950ÎC and in the 10mm diameter round bar heated 
in the atmosphere at 1,000ÎC. The former began to lose boron 
within several hours, and almost all the boron was diffused from 
the test piece after several hundred hours. By contrast, the 
latter began to lose boron in the perimeter after about 3,000 
hours, and continued to decrease to several ppm after about 
5,000 hours. There was no observable reduction of boron up to 
several thousand hours at 950ÎC without load in any 
environment. 



  These results verify that, as a method for evaluating the 
long-term durability of HTTR high-temperature structural 
materials, long hours of environmental effects can be 
accelerated by adjusting the size of test pieces without 
changing temperatures, in other words, by using test pieces with 
a larger relative surface area. 
  [3] Examination of Accelerated Testing Method for Durability 
Evaluation 
  Using the results of search testing to determine the boron 
content in the alloy under different heating conditions, 
combined with a method for analyzing the diffusion of boron in 
the alloy, various methods for predicting the long-term 
durability of high-temperature structural materials for HTTR 
were examined. In order to obtain this index, test pieces that 
were systematically varied in size were analyzed to determine 
their average boron content after being heated in various 
atmospheric conditions, and were evaluated using a model based 
on diffusion theory. 
  a) Analysis of Diffusion Behavior of Boron in the Alloy 
  For a preliminary examination of the diffusion behavior of 
boron in the alloy, the hastelloy XR base with 1 ppm boron was 
welded using hastelloy XR-II with 40 ppm boron as a filler 
material. The welded joint was heated at 950ÎC for 3,000 
hours, and then cut and sanded. The density distribution of the 
boron on the surface of the welded cross-section was analyzed 
with an ion microanalyzer. The results are illustrated in Figure 
III-7. Boron is distributed symmetrically on the welded line as 
a result of being heated at 950ÎC for 3,000 hours in the 
atmosphere. This is true for all cases including the axis from 
the welded metal to the back of the metal plate (circle), the 
axis of jointing at one-quarter T of the plate (triangle), and 
the axis of jointing at one-half T of the plate (square). Figure 
III-7 also includes the results of an analysis of the behavior 
of boron as an unsteady element in a one-dimensional 
interdiffusion model. The profile of the test values of boron 
distribution coincides well with a diffusion model when the 
boron diffusion factor is assumed to be D = 1 x 
10[.sup]-9[/]cm[.sup]2[/]/s. Analytical treatment of this 
kind is considered possible. 



  (b) Examination of Accelerated Evaluation Method Using Size 
Effect 
  Boron diffusion behavior in such practical structural 
materials as round bars and plates also was analyzed -- assuming 
unlimited length with limited diameter and thickness -- using 
the diffusion factor D for boron that was obtained as described 
in the previous section. Figure III-8 illustrates the 
relationship between the heating time required to reduce the 
boron content in solid round bar test pieces and heat 
transmission pipes, made of hastelloy XR-II with 50 ppm boron, 
heated to 950ÎC to 5 ppm, and the diameter of round bars and 
thickness of heat transmission pipes. Changes in the boron 
content as a result of heating solid round bar test pieces 10mm 
in diameter over 20,000 hours can be observed after several 
thousand hours by using solid round bar test pieces 4mm in 
diameter instead. Such a tendency is even greater with heat 
transmission pipes. It should be possible to predict material 
changes in heat transmission pipes over a long period of time 
from the results of tests using round bar test pieces. 



  Based on the results of the examination introduced here, 
basic research concerning various accelerated testing methods is 
in progress to ensure the long-term durability of 
high-temperature structural materials for the HTTR. 
Comprehensive development of a life time evaluation system using 
such analytical methods is also underway. 
<H5>  (2) Corrosion-Resistant Alloys for Reprocessing Plants </H5>
  Current large-scale commercial facilities for reprocessing 
spent light water reactor fuel use the purex process, which 
involves the use of organic solvents dissolved in nitric acid. 
It is planned to improve this method for use as a group 
separation technology in future. On the historical side of 
material technology, however, the durability of stainless steel 
equipment has become an important issue, since the object of 
reprocessing switched from low burn-up metal fuel to high 
burn-up oxide fuel, as illustrated in Figure III-1. For this 
reason, work on durability evaluation methods, material-related 
technologies, the development of corrosion damage data, and 
analytical codes as the basis for a life time forecast database 
is in progress. This involves implementing analytical research 
on the chemical properties of nitric acid solutions; research on 
durability control factors for various conventional materials -- 
such as stainless steel, zirconium, and titanium alloys -- in 
the nitric acid environment; and the development of evaluation 
testing and analysis methods. In addition, work is underway on 
the development of stainless steel, high-chrome compound 
converted alloys, and refractory metal alloys suitable for use 
in the corrosive environment of nitric acid for three levels of 
oxidation. 
  [1] Development of Testing Methods and Evaluation of 
Environmental Corrosion 
  Based on chemical analyses of nitric acid solutions, the 
corrosion of stainless steel in reprocessed nitric acid is 
controlled largely by the chemical condition and the 
electrothermal ebullition condition of various elements 
dissolved from spent fuel, such as FP and TRU. Therefore, to 
characterize the environment, equipment analysis and 
electrochemical measurement methods -- such as state analysis 
and reaction generated gas (NO[.sup]x[/]) analysis of micro 
ionic species based on ion chromatography and high-frequency 
plasma emission analysis -- were established. Subsequently, "the 
on-site analysis method" using the laser Raman method was 
developed. At the same time, we also developed a number of 
evaluation testing methods, such as various corrosion testing 
methods focusing on the corrosion acceleration factors specific 
to the nitric acid environment of fluid condensed nitric acid 
and electrothermal ebullition, slow-speed skew-speed tensile 
testing (SSRT), corrosion fatigue testing, and fletching. 
  As illustrated in Figure III-9, SUS 300 stainless steel, 
which is an ultra-low carbon steel, with sufficient 
sensitization showed a high level of corrosion resistance to 
oxidative acid, which tends to become passive. However, it was 
found that an accelerated corrosion peculiar to reprocessed 
nitric acid took place due both to the dissolved chemical 
properties of nitric acid itself, and to changes in the 
condition of dissolved ions, as indicated in the results of the 
chemical measurement shown in Table III-1. Because the pyrolytic 
response of nitric acid increases at higher temperatures in the 
ebullition condition, the effect of temperature on the corrosion 
speed for the steel in question in the depressurized ebullition 
condition presents two-step changes, as indicated in Figure 
III-10. Also, oxidation generation from trivalent chromium to 
sexivalent chromium occurs only in the theoretical pyrolytic 
temperature range. Furthermore, with regard to heat 
transmission, the corrosion potential rises to the transpassive 
region, as shown in Figure III-9, due to the effects of A and B 
reactions, and general corrosion with prioritized corrosion is 
further promoted. The acceleration of corrosion on the 
generating surface can be understood as a function of the amount 
of evaporation and corrosion accelerating ion parameters. Such 
findings were useful as guidelines in establishing operational 
conditions for the equipment used for generation boiling of 
evaporation cans, methods for material selection, and the 
development of corrosion-resistant alloys with a high level of

  [2] Durability Evaluation Testing and Materials 
  a) Ultra-Low-Carbon Austenitic Stainless Steel 
  For this material, the effects of alloy elements and 
impurities on corrosion in the high potential range from the 
passive state to the transpassive state were studied. It was 
found that the microsegregation that occurs during cooling to 
reach a liquefying processing temperature can cause 
intergranular corrosion with the presence of a few ppm of 
dissolved elements that weaken the cohesion of metal elements 
such as P and B in the transpassive state. Furthermore, based on 
a close examination of cut-out stainless steel parts from a 
demonstration test reactor at the current plant, gradual and 
accelerated growth of corrosion damage (general corrosion 
intergranular corrosion tunnel corrosion corrosion 
crack) of the stainless steel used in high-oxidation nitric acid 
solutions was studied quantitatively. The results of this 
evaluation were reflected in the development of life time 
evaluation methods and new materials. 
  With regard to materials, a compound method for metal 
structure control by adjusting by alloy components combined with 
changes in the intermediate production process was examined as 
illustrated in Figure III-11. Using a compound means of 
purification and a microgranulation to improve grain boundary 
purity based on the electronic beam solution method, as well as 
the skew aging mid- and high-temperature recrystallization 
method, intergranular corrosion, and progressive increase of 
corrosion speed by aging, which is characteristic of the 
transpassive region, did not occur. Tunnel corrosion was 
prevented as well. Furthermore, by examining alloy elements in 
detail to improve corrosion resistance from the passive to 
transpassive regions, as illustrated in the lower diagram of 
Figure III-9, a high-chrome compound addition RW alloy, which 
has more corrosion resistance than stainless steel, was 
developed by the compound addition of a suppresser element (Si) 
for cathode reaction -- which is a reduction response to 
high-oxidation ions and nitric acid -- and film generation 
elements (Cr, W) to suppress anode response. As illustrated in 
Figure III-12, the corrosion resistance of alloys especially 
developed for use in high-oxidation nitric acid is far superior 
to that of conventional steel, and it confirms the effective 
role of Si and W compound additives. 






  b) Refractory Metals Such as Ti and Zr 
  It is necessary to isolate durability problems, and to 
develop quantitative evaluation and analysis methods for 
materials designed to serve as replacements for stainless steel, 
which has transpassive characters, for use in reprocessing 
equipment. Ti has a high degree of auto-ion dissolution in low 
concentration nitric acid. Therefore, analysis of such phenomena 
as corrosion work and pitting corrosion in fresh condensate 
nitric acid under evaporation-condensation conditions, 
separation by hydrolysis, and escape to the gas phase by 
compound formation with thermodynamic instability illustrated in 
Table III-1, which displays new mass transport phenomena, has 
been promoted. 
  Meanwhile, work also has been done on Zr, which has good 
corrosion durability in all ranges of nitric acid concentrations 
in spite of its SCC. Its stress corrosion crack sensitivity was 
evaluated by the slow-speed skew-speed tensile testing (SSTT) 
method, and it was found that the TG (thorough granular) SCC of 
false cleavage crack with sensitivity loss was created in 
boiling nitric acid in several standards. The reduction of 
rapture life time by SCC as a result of increased nitric acid 
concentration, as illustrated in Figure III-13, is greater in 
the test pieces with the densest plane of dense hexagonal 
crystals being oriented in the direction of crack development. 
It was also found that Zr crystals, particularly in softer 
materials, tended to rotate at the tip of cracks as a result of 
low-temperature creep, where stress was concentrated. This 
promoted crack development by orienting the densest plane toward 
the direction of the crack development, and accounted for more 
than 50-60 percent of the fracture factor in false cleavage 
cracks. As there has been insufficient use of the metal in 
question with dense hexagonal crystals as a thick structure 
material, analysis of durability controlling factors by fracture 
mechanic methods, including low-temperature creep and fatigue 
effects, and the development of evaluation methods is underway. 



  Because corrosion improvement of the metal in question 
requires alloying measures that take into account the 
crystallographic anisotropy specific to dense hexagonal 
crystals, methods for improving corrosion resistance focusing on 
the ion radial effect of alloy elements and corrosion crack 
existence have been developed. To improve the corrosion 
resistance of Ti, the addition of corrosion-resistant elements 
such as Ta, which has a similar ion radius, has been found to be 
effective. As for the corrosion crack resistance of Zr, 
improving low-temperature creep by adding corrosion-resistant 
elements with a different ion radius has proved to be effective. 
<H5>  (3) Water-Cooled Reactor Material </H5>
  From the standpoint of thermal neutron economy, a material 
with small cross-section for thermal neutron absorption is 
preferable for the fuel elements of power generation reactors. 
Coated pipes for a new type of light-water reactor with a hard 
neutron energy spectrum, and the primary wall of water-cooled 
nuclear fusion reactors require high mechanical strength in the 
mid-and low-temperature range, as well as a high level of 
several radiation resistance. Austenitic stainless steel in the 
SUS group is one of these candidates. It has been found that the 
major factors governing the life time of this steel in heavily 
irradiated high-temperature water are reduced ductility, and 
radiation-induced stress corrosion crack (IASCC). Analyses of 
material transformation caused by heavy irradiation in the mid- 
and low-temperature range, as well as the development of 
radiation-resistant steel have been conducted. For the former, 
electrochemical measurements such as EPR after heavy 
irradiation, quantitative evaluation methods for sensitivity 
using various corrosion tests, and SSTT test technology for 
high-temperature pure water have been developed. 
  [1] Analysis of Durability Reduction Mechanism by Mid- and 
Low-Temperature Irradiation 
  The sensitivity of stainless steel at temperatures below 
500ÎC was thought to be equivalent to the model for 
M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation and Cr-depleted layer 
formation along with the grain boundary shown in Figure III-9. 
However, it has become known that it is promoted by the spinodal 
decomposition-type microsegregation of atomic layers by the 
interaction between transfer and dissolved elements as a result 
of the increasing over-saturation of dissolved elements, 
including such major elements as Cr, caused by the reduction of 
stabilization of the austenite phase. In addition, among 
interstitial atoms that are spun off under neutron irradiation, 
Ni, P, and Si, which have a smaller ion radius than Fe, begin 
selective diffusion. A phenomenon called radiation-induced 
segregation (RIS), where the concentration and depletion of 
specific elements occur, has been confirmed with STEM. It has 
been found, however, that the P amount of grain boundary 
segregation, and SCC fracture phase factor are not closely 
related. 
  Figure III-14 illustrates the different effects of 
temperature on the high-temperature sensitization of 
M[.sup]23[/]C[.sub]6[/] separation, low-temperature 
sensitization (both by evaluation of latent periods for 
sensitization based on Straus's test) by distorted aging, and 
the EPR test results for a heavily irradiated material. The 
activation energy of the former two is equivalent to the body 
diffusion of Cr, but the activation energy of the latter 
indicates a low value equivalent to the diffusion of 
interstitial atoms (Cr, etc.) of a radiation-induced Frenkel 
defect. This suggests that segregation and depletion occur 
easily on a supersaturated specific surface because of the 
reduced stability of the austenite phase, even at low 
temperatures, as long as it is being irradiated. Much of the 
rapture surface of irradiated SUS 316 steel after the SSTT test 
presents a mixed crack mode consisting mainly of TGSCC on the 
low-temperature side. The IGSCC rapture factor as an IASCC index 
as well as the temperature increases, but there is a lack of a 
corresponding relationship with rapture life time. Concerning 
the evaluation of IASCC sensitivity for heavily irradiated 
materials, the corrosion potential and the transformation mode 
are important factors, as illustrated in Figure III-9, and a 
system to implement a detailed comprehensive examination has 
been developed. This includes the development of ultramicro 
analysis technology for metal structures, and for constituent 
segregation, using evaluation test methods and FEM, which has a 
high level of space resolution. 



  [2] Examination of Methods To Improve IASCC Resistance 
  It is hard to produce He brittleness on stainless steel with 
heavy doses of radiation at mid- and low-temperature. Therefore, 
we have improved the stability of the austenite phase by 
adjusting the Fe/Ni ratio, and by reducing electronic hole 
density. At the same time, we have examined methods designed to 
reduce the supersaturation level of impurities to cause RIS at 
the same time. Since the comprehensive properties of stainless 
steel are optimized when its composition is about 35 percent Ni, 
we have developed 35 Ni-18 Cr-25 Mo steel with a purified grain 
boundary, and reinforced microgranulation. In doing so, we 
introduced purification by the electronic beam production 
method, as well as a distorted aging technique called SAR, and 
thermal processing of recrystallization at middle and low 
temperatures. Compared to the conventional steel, our newly 
developed steel displayed a high level of void swelling 
resistance, and a high level of heat flux resistance, without 
reducing low-temperature sensitivity or ductility at middle and 
low temperatures. 
<H5>  3. Development of Materials Database </H5>
<H5>  (1) Significance of Database for Nuclear Materials </H5>
  As described in Part 1, nuclear development is facing a 
number of problems that cannot be solved by the application of 
conventional materials technology. Thus we anticipate the 
development of new materials that will break through the limits 
of existing materials, together with corresponding application 
technologies. In the past, the research and development of 
nuclear materials in Japan was primarily aimed at meeting 
minimum requirements for individual projects. Therefore, 
research programs and the establishment of databases relied on 
the initiative of individual organizations, and were not 
centralized. Because of the lack of systematic development in 
such projects, they had only a limited impact on the industry. 
  The revision for FY 1987 of the "Long-Term Plan for Nuclear 
Development and Use" by the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan 
urged the prompt development of a comprehensive database as the 
crucial item for basic research on nuclear materials. First, 
individual research organizations were to develop a database for 
their area of specialization, and then link them to share 
intellectual properties, and to promote activities to facilitate 
the effective use of such data. 
  In the next section, we will present an outline of the JAERI 
Material Performance Database (JMPD), a comprehensive nuclear 
materials database being developed by JAERI to aid in the 
development of materials for nuclear reactors and facilities, 
together with the characteristics needed for behavior 
evaluation, structure design, and safety evaluation. 
<H5>  (2) JAERI Material Performance Database </H5>
  As illustrated in Figure III-15, the JMPD is based on a 
general-purpose database management system (DBMS) for large 
computers for storage and search. In addition to this core 
section, it includes a data input and output section, and a 
section for network development. The information to be included 
in the database include data needed for materials design, such 
as radiation-resistant materials, materials to limit induced 
radioactivity, and chemically resistant materials; data needed 
to ensure the safety and durability of the equipment and 
structures introduced in the previous section; and data for 
evaluating the production and performance of new materials, such 
as ceramics and compound materials. There is a problem in that 
it is difficult to determine an appropriate data structure, 
since new and important data are continuously being generated, 
and the significance of data items can change radically in some 
cases. Therefore, a relational database has been selected for 
the DBMS in view of the need for a flexible data structure, and 
for ease of data renewal. Information that cannot be described 
in the current data structure, but that is likely to become 
important in future can be included in the section for remarks. 
Considering the characteristics of the base data for nuclear 
materials, a data structure capable of uniformly describing data 
items related to radiation, and the nuclear-specific chemical 
environment has been selected. 



  As for data output, because flexibility of the retrieval 
system is the most significant factor, a program with the 
following features has been developed internally: [1] it can be 
operated freely without a special knowledge of computers, [2] 
retrieval can be made without referring to the design document 
for data structure, and [3] the relative importance of data 
items can be alternated easily to follow the results of 
development of research. Figure III-16 provides a comparison of 
retrieval processes based on (1) ordinary SQL commands, and (2) 
the internally developed program, to indicate the performance of 
the newly developed retrieval program. It confirms that the 
method developed in the current program makes it easier for 
ordinary materials researchers to conduct a data search. User 
friendliness has been improved by the development of a unit 
conversion function, a data listing function, a retrieved data 
storage function, an interconnection (with different computers) 
function, and an on-line help function. 



  Data for about 7,000 test pieces drawn primarily from 
materials research at JAERI have already been stored in the 
JMPD, and have been used for analysis and evaluation. 
Furthermore, concerning the networking of materials data, 
although it is not introduced here, development of a prototype 
system for a distributed data network for materials called the 
"data freeway" is in progress. Eventually, it will link the 
Tokai Research Establishment of JAERI, the Tsukuba Branch of the 
National Research Institute for Metals, and the Oarai 
Engineering Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation.

<H5>  Part IV </H5>
  Many kinds of materials are needed in the nuclear field. 
Therefore, research and development on a broad range of 
materials from structural materials to functional materials, and 
from metals to ceramics, is necessary. Ceramics materials, 
except for nuclear fuels, are not at the stage of practical use 
for the current generation of nuclear plants. However, the use 
of ceramics as materials for specific uses and functions in 
nuclear systems oriented toward high-temperature, such as 
process heating high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and nuclear 
fusion reactors, has been growing in importance. For instance, 
the following uses can be considered: graphite materials for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, coated particle fuels and 
fuels for light water reactors and fast reactors, solid blanket 
breeder materials for nuclear fusion reactors, ion-conductive 
ceramics for the tritium collection system in nuclear fusion 
reactors and hydrogen production using nuclear heat in 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, translucent and 
photo-conductive ceramics for the measuring system in nuclear 
fusion reactors, and semiconductive and piezoelectric ceramics 
for robot sensors in highly radioactive environments. 
  There are two ways to evaluate the suitability of materials 
for use in the nuclear field. One is to examine the adaptability 
of candidate materials to the nuclear environment (by examining 
their adaptability to the conditions provided by existing data, 
such as radiation, temperature, pressure, and atmosphere, and 
then confirming it by experiments). The other is to create new 
materials suitable for the nuclear environment (by designing and 
creating new materials to meet conditions for use based on 
research in production, structure, and solid state properties, 
and then confirming it by experiments). Based on the recent 
research principle that it is necessary to consider designing on 
the atomic and molecular levels to create radiation-resistant 
ceramics for nuclear use, there have been a number of 
experiments designed to realize new materials created using 
molecular dynamics computer simulation with artificial lattice 
formation technology, such as a molecular beam epitaxy method, 
and to verify the results by experiments with radiation. 
  This section introduces a number of new materials 
development 
technologies based on nuclear reactor fuel research. These 
include ceramics compound technology using the sol-gel process, 
the use of transient metal carbides as ultra-high-temperature 
materials, and research on actinoid compounds. As part of the 
search for functional materials, the study and use of 
ultra-ion-conductor ceramics and new glass materials, as well as 
the application of computer simulation are described. 
<H5>  1. Nuclear Reactor Fuel and New Materials </H5>
<H5>  (1) Fine Ceramics Science and Nuclear Reactor Fuel </H5>
  The history of commercial nuclear reactor fuels overlaps 
with 
the history of fine ceramics science, which began about 1950. 
Research on the development of uranium dioxide started in the 
transition period from the classical ceramics industry, which 
was based on natural minerals, to the fine ceramics industry, 
which is based on characteristic-controlled compound materials, 
and progressed by absorbing its results immediately. In some 
aspects, it led the fine ceramics industry. Since the results of 
oxide fuel research, which started in the United States and 
Britain, were translated to the area of general ceramics, many 
of them are not informed directly. A search for various compound 
processes, compositions to meet specific use conditions, and 
design and control of micro-organisms are required for the 
development of advanced materials. Research and development of 
nuclear reactor fuel and fuel elements is an area where these 
factors must be taken into account. 
  Although there are options for light-water reactor fuel that 
feature improved burning characteristics, plutonium recycling, 
and burn up processing, there are many aspects of oxide fuel 
that require research and development from the standpoint of new 
materials development. At the same time, long-term objectives 
beyond the current generation of light-water reactors requires 
the elaboration of nonoxide fuels (nitride, carbide oxide), as 
well as research and development on new ceramic coating 
materials. In this area, technological development is in 
progress both for production process and characterization. Such 
technology may possibly be applied to new materials development 
in general beyond nuclear reactor fuel. 
<H5>  (2) New Development of Sol-Gel Process </H5>
  At present, oxide fuels for light water reactors and fast 
reactors are produced by the powder formation method. However, 
research to simplify this process based on a wet method has been 
conducted at various places in conjunction with work to process 
collected reprocessing fuel. So-called "sol-gel process" was 
devised at Oak Ridge National Research Center of the United 
States, and began to spread to ceramics production in general. 
  A general advantage of the sol-gel process is its 
flexibility 
in managing the shape, composition, and properties of products. 
This process makes it possible to form ultra-micro-monodisperse 
powder as well as relatively large integrally molded pieces for 
shape, to mix components on an extremely small scale for 
composition, and to control density as well as porosity for 
properties. This is the reason why the sol-gel process has come 
to be applied extensively in areas outside nuclear reactor fuel. 
  It is not easy to define the sol-gel process clearly. In the 
narrow sense, it is a process to turn (1) a suspension (sol) of 
metal compound particles as a starting material (2) into an 
intermediate material by livering, and (3) to acquire ceramic 
products by burning it. The method used at JAERI to compound 
thorium oxide fuel microspheres is equivalent to a typical 
sol-gel process. 
  With the method used at JAERI, a thoria sol is produced by 
adding ammonia gas to a thorium nitrate solution. A feature of 
this method is to control the development process of colloidal 
particles in the sol by adjusting the pH of the solution. An 
effective way to prevent cracks and deformation of microspheres 
by shrinkage in the subsequent gelling process is to increase 
the size of colloidal particles in the sol and to increase the 
colloidal content (Figure IV-1). Micro gel spheres obtained this 
way are transformed to high-density microspheres of 
ThO[.sup]2[/] and (Th, U)O[.sub]2[/] by thermal processing. 



  The particle size of microspheres can be controlled by 
changing the dropping conditions, such as the nozzle size. 
Particles with a diameter of several hundred Êm are coated 
with ceramics and used as coated particle fuel for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. Smaller particles with a 
diameter of about 150 Êm (Figure IV-2) can be compounded and 
used as a material for the gel particle pressure mold method to 
produce high-density pellets. In the latter case, drying water 
in gel particles after replacement with alcohol produces soft 
microspheres with a stable pore structure. Using these 
microspheres as a material for pressure molding, thorium nitrate 
high-density fuel pellets over 96 percent TD can be obtained at 
a low sintering temperature of 1,300ÎC. 



  In the sol-gel process, in a broader sense, the sol stage is 
often omitted. In the case of UO[.sup]2[/][.sup]+2[/] 
ions, a highly concentrated sol cannot be formed unless 
U[.sup]+6[/] is reduced to U[.sup]+4[/]. Therefore, the 
nitrate solution generally is transformed directly to the gel 
without going through the sol stage. Creation of viscosity, by 
adding a suitable polymer to a uranyl nitrate solution, 
facilitates the stable formation of droplets. Gel spheres can be 
obtained by processing the droplets with ammonia. 
UO[.sup]2[/] microspheres to be used as coated particle fuel 
for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors are manufactured by 
Atomic Fuel Industries in such a process. In this method, 
droplets are formed in an ammonia gas atmosphere, and are gelled 
by dropping them into ammonia water. This method of working with 
ammonia externally is called the external gelling method. 
  As already stated, one of the characteristics of the sol-gel 
process is ease of composition management. As an example of the 
application of the external gelling method, UO[.sup]2[/] 
particles supplemented with ZrC, SiC, etc. as oxygen getters or 
simulated fission products have been produced experimentally, 
and have been used as fuel behavior test pieces in laboratories. 
  In contrast to the external gelling method, with the 
internal 
gelling method, gel particles are obtained by adding materials 
that generate ammonia when heated -- such as hexamethylene 
tetramine (HMTA) and urea -- to a nitrate solution, and then 
dropping this solution into some heating medium. At JAERI, the 
internal gelling method has been developed as a compound method 
for nonoxide fuels. In this case, a correct amount of carbon 
powder is added to the solution to obtain gel spheres that 
firmly combine oxide and carbon. It is possible to obtain 
carbides (UC, UC[.sup]2[/]), and carbide oxides (UCO), by 
heating them in a vacuum. It is also possible to obtain nitrides 
by heating in a nitrogen-hydrogen mixed stream. 
  As an option to process transuranic elements (TRU) such as 
neptunium and americium, concepts for a TRU annihilation 
disposal reactor and its fuel cycle have been examined. In order 
for annihilation disposal to be valid, it is essential to 
minimize actinide loss of the fuel cycle as a whole. It is 
possible to minimize the loss in the fuel processing stage by 
applying the sol-gel process properly as a fuel compound method. 
In this case, direct compounding of microspheres of fuel 
materials without involving powder is an important advantage. 
However, application to TRU will require experimental validation 
to ensure against the possibility of the stock solution becoming 
unstable due to heat produced by serious _a_ decay. 
  The alkoxide gelling method is a sol-gel process in the 
broad 
sense, and has been noted as a compound method for producing 
monodisperse oxide powder and a special glass body. We have 
developed the technology to compound dystetic transition metal 
carbides such as ZrC, TiC, and ZrB[.sup]2[/], borides and 
their compounds based on the alkoxide gelling method. Metal 
alkoxide is hydrolyzed in a carbon-suspended liquid to produce a 
tight compound gel of oxide and carbon. By heating the gel in a 
vacuum, a soft carbon aggregate can be obtained. This aggregate 
can be shattered to particles with a diameter of about 100 nm by 
radiating it with ultrasonic waves for a short time. An 
important point in its process is the selection of materials to 
match the isoelectric point of metal oxide and carbon, as well 
as implementing hydrolysis near the isoelectric point. This 
makes it possible to incorporate carbon particles into the 
network of oxide particles. 
  Transient metal carbide and boride have a number of useful 
characteristics, such as high fusion points, low relative 
density, and high strength. Thus their application can be 
expanded to high-temperature structural materials, and to 
coating materials. Micropowders with a high degree of 
dispersibility by the alkoxide gelling method can be used as a 
material powder for plasma coating. 
<H5>  (3) New Type of Coated Particle Fuel and Application </H5>
  The basic unit of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor fuel 
is 
a coated fuel particle with a diameter at about 1mm. Each 
particle is an oxide fuel microsphere with four layers of 
coating of low-density thermal decomposition carbon, 
high-density thermal decomposition carbon, silicon carbide 
(SiC), and high-density thermal decomposition carbon. The four 
layers of coating serve to protect each other, and also function 
together as a pressurized container for nuclear fission 
products. For instance, the low-density carbon layer functions 
as a gas plenum, and protects the outer layer from fission 
fragments. The SiC layer functions as a diffusion barrier 
against metal fission products such as Cs and Sr. The coating is 
made by the high-temperature chemical vaporization method, while 
fuel particles are mixed in a sprouted bed. 
  The concept of a coated particle fuel is a technology 
designed to achieve high burn up at high temperatures that 
cannot be achieved by other fuel types, and the expansion of its 
applications to take advantage of its properties has been 
examined. At JAERI, research and development on a coated 
particle fuel with a zirconium carbide (ZrC) layer instead of 
the SiC layer has been conducted. 
  The ZrC coated layer is formed by the reaction of zirconium 
halide and carbon hydride also in the sprouted bed. While SiC 
decomposes in a short time at temperatures over 2,200 K, ZrC is 
hard to melt, having a fusion point at 3,693 K. ZrC, as an 
intermetal compound of transient metals, has higher 
intergranular stability than SiC, which has an inherent 
intergranular instability as a covalent compound semiconductor. 
Use of the ZrC coated particle fuel in a test fuel assembly for 
the high-temperature engineering test reactor is being 
considered. Furthermore, another system to utilize the superior 
heat resistance of ZrC-coated particle fuel is space nuclear 
reactors. 
  Nuclear reactors in space can be used for power generation 
and propulsion power for stations, a moon base, and deep space 
exploration. Processing of waste heat is a big problem for space 
power generating reactors, and improved efficiency in 
radiational cooling is a key to the reduction of the system to a 
size appropriate for space development. In the concept shown in 
Figure IV-3, heat is led to the thermo-electric converter 
through lithium heat pipes that are laid to a core consisting of 
a layer filled with ZrC coated fuel particles. It is desirable 
to raise the operational temperature, and, therefore, the fuel 
temperature as much as possible to improve radiational cooling 
efficiency. 



  Further, nuclear heat-propelled rockets for manned space 
exploration requires a fuel temperature as high as 2,400ÎC. 
However, in this case, the required integrated burn up time and 
burn up rate are smaller. Figure IV-4 illiterates the results of 
heating ZrC coated fuel particles produced experimentally for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors to 2,400ÎC after 
irradiation. Although ordinary SiC-coated fuel particles were 
mostly destroyed before reaching 2,400ÎC, ZrC-coated fuel 
particles were maintained at 2,400ÎC without being damaged. 




  Another area of possible application of coated particle fuel 
is in TRU extinction processing. The possibility of compounding 
fuel microspheres containing TRU from a group-separated TRU salt 
solution by the sol-gel process was mentioned earlier. In 
principle, such microspheres can be coated in various ways by 
the chemical evaporation method. 
  Figure IV-5 illustrates a concept for the direct cooling of 
a 
concentric cylinder made of a metal frit (net) filled with fuel 
particle consisting of TRU nitride coated with titanium nitride. 
Nitride is compatible with metals. By cooling particle fuel with 
a large relative surface area, fuel temperature is kept within 
one-third of the fusing point (about 3,000 K) of TRU nitride, 
and the transfer of fission products in the fuel material is 
controlled. This concept is designed to minimize the thickness 
of the coating needed to maintain soundness, and to achieve a 
hard-core neutron spectrum suitable for TRU fission burn up of 
TRU. It is also intended to realize high output density, or high 
nuclear transfer speed, by cooling the particles directly. 



<H5>  (4) Actinide Compounds </H5>
  The difficulty in predicting the behavior of actinide solids 
is closely related to the behavior of the 5f electron. This is 
because the degree of the effect of the 5f electron on linkage 
differs depending on the specific actinide elements, other 
elements used for alloys and compounds, and environmental 
conditions such as temperature and pressure. 
  Actinides can be divided roughly into two groups, from Th to 
Pu, and Am and beyond. In many ways, actinides beyond Am are 
similar to lanthanides. Although the concept of group separation 
as well as extinction processing of TRU has been examined at 
various places, it is noted that Np and Am, the main components 
of waste TRU, are very different from each other in their 
characteristics in the examination of fuels and targets. 
  TRU nitride, as well as alloys, is one of the hopeful 
candidates for TRU extinction processing fuels. The reason is 
that, while actinides are extremely variable in their 
characteristics as individual metals, and it is difficult to 
predict their behavior, nitrides are expected to share their 
characteristics. Therefore, the database for UN and (U, Pu)N is 
expected to be used to predict the behavior of nitride fuels 
containing TRU to a certain degree. 
  However, there is no sufficient database for UN and (U, Pu)N 
at present. There is a cooperative project between JAERI and PNC 
on irradiation testing for (U, Pu)N fuel using the Joyo reactor. 
A production technology for compound nitride pellets based on a 
powder method has almost been completed. Building on this 
technology, research on NpN compounds has begun. 
  Concerning the basic solid state properties for nitrides, 
thermal diffusion rate measurement and vapor pressure 
measurement are in progress. The evaporation behavior of 
individual nitrides is relatively simple. As UN has a lower U 
partial pressure than N[.sup]2[/] partial pressure, nitrogen 
is lost with priority, and a metal liquid phase is separated at 
high temperatures over 1,700ÎC. Even though the evaporation 
behavior of these nitride compounds is complex, a precise 
understanding is required since the appearance of the liquid 
phase temperature defines the maximum fuel line output. 
  Using the measurement results from laboratories and 
reference 
information, we have established a system to implement routinely 
multiple-compound, multiple-phase equilibrium analysis. Figure 
IV-6 illustrates the results of an evaporation behavior analysis 
for (U, Pu)N. We plan to further develop the database for 
actinide alloys, ceramics, and fused salt. 



  Along with the increase in burn up rates and burn up ratio 
of 
plutonium, the density of precious metal fission products in 
spent fuel increases radically compared to the conventional 
fuels. In some conditions, an alloy phase such as (U, 
Pu)Pd[.sup]3[/] may appear and become a problem in 
reprocessing due to its refractory property. Research on 
actinide inter-metal compounds is an important item for future 
research. 
  Certain types of actinide inter-metal compounds are 
interesting as research objects for superconductivity and 
magnetic properties. For Pu and Np, in addition to Th and U, a 
system to implement production of various compounds and alloys 
as well as characterization is being developed. 
<H5>  2. Search and Application of Functional Materials </H5>
  In the nuclear field as well, ceramics, amorphous materials, 
and random system materials such as glass and fused salt have 
been noted as useful functional materials for special purposes. 
Various solid state properties of these materials are closely 
related to their structures, and a study of their structural 
properties is the most basic research objective in examining the 
properties of these materials. As experimental means of 
structural analysis, such methods as X-ray and neutron ray 
diffractometry, laser Raman spectroscopy, and infrared 
spectroscopy are commonly used. However, with these methods, it 
is difficult to obtain binary distribution functions between the 
constituent atoms except for special elements. On the other 
hand, it is extremely useful to apply molecular dynamics 
computer simulation, which has made rapid progress recently, to 
these random systems. For instance, although it requires massive 
amounts of time and money to obtain the solid state properties 
of fused salt only from experiments, supplementing such efforts 
with computer simulation helps predict an optimum material 
system with target property values. 
  In this section, we will discuss ultra-ion-conductive 
materials as examples of ceramic functional materials, as well 
as research on fluoride glass, which is useful in the infrared 
range, and structural property evaluation by molecular dynamics 
computer simulation as examples of random system. 
<H5>  (1) Ultra-Ion-Conductive Materials </H5>
  There are materials that are solid and capable of 
transferring only specific constituent elements (called 
ultra-ion conductors). Such materials are being considered for 
application in lithium cells, third-generation fuel cells, etc. 
Although it might seem surprising, ultra-ion-conductive 
materials are familiar materials in the nuclear field. 
UO[.sup]2[/], a nuclear fuel material, is a typical ultra-ion 
conductor for oxygen ions. Lithium oxide (Li[.sup]2[/]O), the 
strongest candidate for the solid blanket material of fusion 
reactors, is also an ultra-ion conductor for lithium ions, and 
its various properties are closely related to the behavior of 
lithium ions. The following is a description of the 
high-temperature steam electrolytic method using a stabilized 
zirconium solid electrolyte, which is an oxygen ion conductor. 
  This method can be applied to tritium hydrolysis in the fuel 
circulation system for fusion reactors, and to the production of 
hydrogen for the heat use system in high-temperature gas-cooled 
reactors. Figure IV-7 illustrates the basic principle of this 
method. Electrolytic cells consist of an ion conductor 
(electrolyte) and two electrodes on both sides. Water is 
supplied to the cathode in the form of vapor. An electrolytic 
reaction on the cathode side reduces the water, and hydrogen gas 
is separated. Generated oxygen ions are transferred through the 
electrolyte, and become oxygen gas being oxidized on the cathode 
side. Therefore, when vapor is supplied to one side of a ceramic 
barrier to become electrolyzed, vapor and a hydrogen compound 
gas are obtained, and, on the other side, oxygen gas is 
obtained. Research and development for the reverse process of 
this system is also in progress. This has raised some 
interesting nuclear-related topics, exemplifying the changes in 
approach to various research activities. 



  Figure IV-8 illustrates the hydrogen conversion rates for 
vapor as a function of temperature and electrolytic voltage in 
the ideal condition of no internal resistance in the electrolyte 
cells. When responding to tritium hydrolysis in the fuel 
circulation system for fusion reactors, it is necessary to 
operate in a relatively low-temperature range from the 
standpoint of safety. Therefore, it becomes necessary to search 
for solid electrolyte materials with little resistance. When 
zirconia to which ytterbium oxide 
(Yb[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) has been added is used, 
electrolyte resistance is radically reduced, and electrolyte 
cells can operate sufficiently at around 600ÎC. It has been 
confirmed that almost 100 percent of the tritium vapor is 
decomposed in the real tritium circulation system, such as the 
BEATRIX-II Project, where tritium breeding material in FFTF is 
examined experimentally to determine its breeding properties 
under neutron radiation. 



  As discussed in detail in Part II, research and development 
on lithium oxide (Li[.sup]2[/]O) as tritium breeding material 
for fusion reactors is underway, and it is extremely interesting 
from the standpoint of material science, as is UO[.sup]2[/]. 
UO[.sup]2[/] has a fluor structure. In contrast, 
Li[.sup]2[/]O has a reverse fluor structure, where, as 
opposed to UO[.sup]2[/], oxygen is placed in the position of 
U and Li in the position of oxygen. Therefore, as illustrated in 
Figure IV-9, Li in Li[.sup]2[/]O has an extremely large 
self-diffusion coefficient, as in oxygen in UO[.sup]2[/] (or 
ThO[.sup]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/]). Although the fusing 
point of Li[.sup]2[/]O is over 1,600ÎC, its 
self-diffusion coefficient at 1,000ÎC is about 
10[.sup]-6[/]cm[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/], about half the 
value of ordinary materials in the liquid state. This suggests 
that it is highly probable that a Li atom in the solid state of 
Li[.sup]2[/]O is away from its inherent atomic position, much 
as occurs in the liquid state. This is called sublattice melt, 
and has been verified with laser Raman spectroscopy. Figures 
IV-10 and 11 illustrate Raman spectrum and changes in line width 
by temperature for Li[.sup]2[/]O. The line width of the Raman 
spectrum has a large value at about 100 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 
1,000ÎC, and it is judged that Li atoms are moving actively 
around the inherent atom location. 









  In this way, Li[.sup]2[/]O and UO[.sub]2[/] 
(ThO[.sup]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/]) are important materials 
for nuclear systems, and are interesting as materials for the 
analysis of the ultra-ion electrical conduction mechanism from 
the standpoint of material science as well. 
<H5>  (2) Fluoride Glass with Beryllium Fluoride </H5>
  Highly purified SiO[.sup]2[/] glass is used for a 
commercial photoconductive material, but its working wavelength 
range is limited to 0.6-1.8 Êm. In the meantime, research and 
development using fluoride glass -- which can be used in the 
infrared range and has theoretically superior photoconductive 
properties to SiO[.sup]2[/] glass -- is in progress. 
  There are two types of fluoride glass: BeF[.sup]2[/], 
ZrF[.sup]4[/]-BaF[.sub]2[/] and 
HfF[.sup]4[/]-BaF[.sub]2[/] glass, which have superior 
stability for glass crystallization, and AlF[.sup]3[/] glass, 
which has superior scientific stability and mechanical 
properties. 
  Recently, JAERI succeeded in developing an 
AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] fluoride glass, which has 
superior scientific stability and mechanical properties, as well 
as superior stability for glass crystallization. This was 
achieved by adding a small amount of BeF[.sup]2[/], which has 
superior glass stability, to AlF[.sup]3[/] glass, which has 
superior scientific stability and mechanical properties. 
Stability of the glass state increases in proportion to the 
difference between crystallization temperature (T[.sup]x[/]) 
and glassification transfer temperature (T[.sup]g[/]). Table 
IV-1 presents values for T[.sup]g[/] and _D_T (= 
T[.sup]x[/]-T[.sub]g[/]) of 
AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] fluoride glass compared to 
those of a representative fluoride glass. It shows that, 
although ZBLAN is the most common ZrF[.sup]4[/] glass, the 
stability of AlF[.sup]3[/] glass with a little 
BeF[.sup]2[/] is radically improved. As it is obvious from 
Table IV-1, fluoride glass with ThF[.sup]4[/] appears to have 
a high level of performance, which is interesting.

  Assuming the reason for the vast improvement in stability of 
AlF[.sup]3[/] glass with additional BeF[.sub]2[/] lies in 
its structural properties (three-dimensional atom distribution), 
its three-dimensional structural properties have been analyzed 
using molecular dynamics computer simulation. 
  The potential energy between two bodies of BeF[.sup]2[/] 
used in the computation is illustrated in Figure IV-12. In order 
to verify the potential energy precisely, an _a_-quartz 
BeF[.sup]2[/] crystal was reproduced in the computer, and its 
structural parameters were compared with actual measurements. 
The results are presented in Table IV-2. Computed values for 
structural parameters coincided well with the actual values 
obtained by neutron ray diffractometry, and the appropriateness 
of the potential energy used was confirmed. 






  A structural model of AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] 
(66.7-33.3 mol%) glass at 300 K was obtained using the 
same 
potential energy. The results are illustrated in Figure IV-13. 
In glass, Al[.sup]3+[/] and F[.sup]-[/] constitute 
AlF[.sup]6[/] octahedron according to analysis based on most 
approximate inter-atom distance, coordination number, and angle 
distribution for F-Al-F (&lt; F-Al-F). It has been found that a 
three-dimensional mesh structure is developed between the 
AlF[.sup]6[/] octahedron and BeF[.sub]4[/] tetrahedron, 
created by the addition of BeF[.sup]2[/], with F as the 
common vertex. This is the reason for the production of stable 
glass with additional BeF[.sup]2[/]. 



<H5>  3. Conclusion </H5>
  Actinide compounds and lithium oxide, core materials for 
nuclear systems, are extremely peculiar materials from the 
standpoint of material science. They are also quite interesting 
for the analysis of the superconductivity mechanism for heavy 
fermion, and for the analysis of the ultra-ion conduction 
mechanism. It is one of the research objectives of material 
science to explore such exotic materials, and it is necessary 
for researchers not to shut themselves within conventional 
research concepts, and to change their thought patterns.

<H5>  1. Energy Beams as Means of Processing Materials </H5>
  There are a number of materials with peculiar properties 
that 
reflect their microscopic atomic and electronic structures. By 
processing these materials properly, their properties can be 
made to play a role as functional materials. However, the adding 
new functions or compounding functions by means of artificial 
control requires the alteration of material structures with a 
method that far exceeds the compound energy of materials. This 
method of processing materials must be able to control space, 
time, energy volume, etc., very precisely. From this standpoint, 
directional energy beams such as ions, electrons, and lasers 
become important means of developing new functional materials by 
controlling material conditions artificially. 
  For such research and development efforts, an understanding 
of the interaction between energy beams and target materials is 
significant. The basic interaction process involves the 
introduction of heterogeneous elements, electronic excitation, 
elastic collision, and nuclear reaction, and their ratios change 
according to the combinations of various kinds of energy beams 
and target materials. Ion beams, for example, play different 
interaction roles in different energy domains. Such a situation 
is surveyed in Table V-1. In general, the higher the level of 
energy is, the greater is the ratio of imparted energy for the 
electronic excitation process. The following is a discussion of 
the alteration of material structures, taking as a typical 
example organic materials, which are affected largely by 
electronic excitation processes, and inorganic materials, which 
are affected largely by the introduction of heterogeneous 
elements and elastic collision processes. 



<H5>  2. Organic Materials </H5>
  Organic polymers are used not only in all phases of our 
life, 
but are also very familiar as materials that constitute living 
organisms. Living organisms are quite well constructed, and are 
capable of responding properly to changes in the external 
environment. This is because the polymers that constitute 
organisms, such as membranes, have specific functions. 
Therefore, the artificial synthesis of such functional polymers 
has been studied, for instance, for such materials as selective 
separation membranes that allow specific materials to permeate, 
photochromic materials that change colors by radiation of light, 
and materials with high-temperature superconductivity. These 
materials are types of functional materials that not only 
implement the functions of living organisms, but also possess 
new functions that living organisms do not have. 
  In synthesizing such organic functional materials, the use 
of 
energy beams, especially the use of electronic beams, has been 
studied. Recently, there has been considerable research on the 
use of ion beams and laser beams as well. 
<H5>  (1) Use of Electronic Beams </H5>
  The reactions of materials that are radiated by electronic 
beams can be grouped into two categories: the primary process, 
where the energy of radiated electrons is applied to the 
material through collision and ionization, as well as 
excitation, and occurs adiabatically in a very short time; and 
the secondary process, which is caused by ions, radicals, and 
excitation molecules generated in the primary process. 
Electronic beams used for material synthesis normally have 
energy levels of from several hundred keV to several MeV, and 
the energy of the secondary electrons, generated in the primary 
process, at about 40-50 eV, also affects the secondary process. 
From the standpoint of molecules that collide, the effects of 
the secondary electrons are overwhelmingly larger than the 
direct effects of the radiated electrons. The secondary 
electrons with low energy levels generate ionization as well as 
excitation continuously in the neighborhood of their occurrence, 
and produce several ions and excitation molecules. As these ions 
and excitation molecules possess excessive energy, they 
themselves develop into other ions and radicals, and also 
generate various products due to addition, charge transfer, and 
reaction with neutral molecules. 
  Synthesis of particles and thin films can be done by 
polymerization using electronic beam radiation. For instance, 
stable particles with a diameter of 20-30 Êm were obtained by 
emulsion polymerization of styrene. Positive and negative resist 
materials also were obtained by applying 20 layers of polymer 
thin film on a silicon or gallium arsenide wafer, and then 
radiating it with electronic beams 250 nm in diameter. 
  The graft polymerization method is often used as a 
polymerization method. In this method, polymer radicals 
generated by radiation are used as a starter for polymerization 
response of monomers. As graft polymerization using monomers 
that are different from the constituent unit of the base 
polymers results in chemical synthesis of polymers of different 
properties, the properties of the original polymers can be 
changed permanently. Since the yield of graft polymerization is 
dependent on the radiation dose, and not on dose rate, the 
amount of starter needed for a reaction can be obtained in a 
short time by irradiating it at a high dose rate using an 
accelerator. 
  Practical application of graft polymerization by electronic 
beam radiation was examined, and a film that was permeable only 
to positive ions selectively was developed. This was 
accomplished by introducing carboxyl into the film, which was 
radiated with the accelerator, to produce graft polymerization 
of acrylic acid. In this case, it is necessary to distribute the 
polymerized acrylic acid in the film uniformly so it will serve 
as a separating membrane. This was achieved in the practical 
process by setting the radiation dose at 100-200 kGy, and the 
reaction time at two to three hours. This product has been used 
for separating membranes of button-type silver oxide cells. 
There also is the possibility of using it for separating 
membranes of nickel cadmium secondary cells in the future. The 
same method is used for graft polymerization of radiated fiber 
polymers, such as polypropylene, with styrene, and it is 
expected to be put into practical use as an absorbent deodorizer 
for ammonia gas, tobacco smoke, and pet odor. Furthermore, 
heat-resistant and chemical-resistant ion exchange films, 
selective permeable films for gas and liquids, metal collectors, 
and organism-affinity films and tube are in the stage of 
research and development. 
  In this way, there are many research examples of the 
synthesis of organic functional materials using electronic 
beams, and such research and development is expected to further 
expand in the future. One reason is that electronic accelerators 
can be utilized relatively easily. At present there are about 
800 accelerators in Japan, and about 20 percent of them are 
estimated to be for industrial use. It is also noted that the 
advantage of using electronic beams for synthesis methods has 
become obvious. Catalyzers are usually used for the synthesis of 
organic materials. Using electronic beams, however, has a number 
of advantages. For example, there is no need for high 
temperatures, no chance of introducing impurities such as 
catalyzer pieces into products, and easy control of the reaction 
by turning the beams on and off. 
<H5>  (2) Use of Ion Beam </H5>
  Figure V-1 illustrates a typical phenomenon that occurs when 
ion beams are radiated on a material. The figure shows the 
results of radiation on a silicon wafer by changing the energy 
of Pd ions from several 10 eV to several MeV. At 1 keV or below, 
radiated ions lose energy on the material surface, and 
accumulate as a film after being neutralized. At 1 MeV or above, 
a layer is formed deep inside the material. The depth changes 
approximately in proportion to the injected energy of the ions. 
In the energy range between 1 keV and 1 MeV, the sputter 
phenomenon, where atoms on the surface of the material are cut 
out by colliding ions, is observed. The curve in the center of 
the figure indicates the numbers of ions sputtered by an ion. 
Similar trends can be observed in any combination of materials 
and ions, even though there are some differences in the range of 
energy and sputter rate. 



  Based on such radiation effects, research on the possibility 
of adding functions to organic materials has been conducted 
(Table V-2). The most commonly reported research involves 
improvements in the electric conductivity of plastics, such as 
polyethylene. There is a report on polyacethylene, where p-n 
junction occurred between the layer created by ion injection and 
the original material. Concerning surface improvement, there are 
examples of improved adhesion between metal and plastic, as well 
as improved antithrombotic properties in silicon rubber. There 
have been experiments with ion beam resists in the submicron 
range, permeability improvement for gas, and optical reflectance 
and refractivity improvements. These improvements to organic 
materials by ion beam radiation can be accounted for as the 
result of the cutting of molecular chains, carbonization, and 
switching to the amorphous state.

  There has been some experimentation aimed at generating 
rather different phenomena by radiating ion beams on organic 
materials. For instance, this technique is used to control 
perforation by nuclear track and molecular orientation. When 
ions with a large atomic number and an energy level higher than 
several 10 MeV are radiated on an organic film, the ions, 
without stopping, penetrate the film if it is thin. When this 
film is processed with acid or alkali, the film is perforated 
through the sections where the ions penetrated. An organic film 
suitable for this purpose is a polymer named CR-39. CR-39 has 
been used for neutron ray detectors, and as a material for dose 
measurement in space. 
  CR-39 film was radiated with gold ion beams with an energy 
level of 11.4 MeV per nucleon, and processed in a sodium hydrate 
solution at 6N at 60ÎC for four to five hours to obtain a 
perforated film. The film has about 5 x 10[.sup]5[/] holes, 
which are basically vertical cylinders, with a diameter of 2 
Êm, per 1 cm[.sup]2[/]. Only the holes of the film were 
then chemically modified by graft polymerization. For example, 
when the holes were combined with a kind of hydrogen that varies 
its volume by temperature by 5 percent in weight, the holes at 
1.2 Êm at 40ÎC were completely shut at 0ÎC (Figure 
V-2) as observed with an electronic microscope. Using this 
phenomenon, it is possible to produce a new film that controls 
the flow through its holes by changes of temperature. 



  When molecules with both hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic 
groups in the same molecular structure are dropped on the 
surface of water, and repeat arranging orientation by adding 
pressure and catching with a glass wafer, a film consisting of 
layers of single-molecule films can be obtained. However, its 
mechanical strength is not sufficient as it is, and it is 
necessary to reinforce the film by combining individual 
molecules by such methods as polymerization. Then, after 
accumulating diacetylene monomers for 30 to 50 layers, it was 
polymerized by irradiating it with ion beams and ultraviolet 
rays. An examination of the structure of the layered film by 
X-ray diffraction spectrum showed that a film with superb 
orientation could be obtained with ion beam radiation compared 
to ultraviolet ray radiation. As illustrated in Figure V-3, when 
flex monomers are radiated with ion beams, the carbon-carbon 
linkage is shaken and polymerized after all the molecules are 
loosened. The oriented organic thin film obtained this way has a 
long conjugate system, and features nonlinear optical properties 
such as p electrons can move about the layers freely. For 
instance, when this film was injected by an optic laser with a 
wavelength of 1.907 Êm, higher harmonics waves with a 
frequency three times higher were observed. When such a material 
with three-dimensional nonlinear optics is used, diffraction 
factors and absorption coefficients can be changed. Therefore, 
such materials are expected to be applied to elements for 
optical communications and optical memory in future. 



  Recently, materials (hybrid materials) that are accumulated 
for materials to interact with each other on the atomic and 
molecular levels are being considered. When realized, such 
materials should have superb properties that far exceed those of 
the original materials. The creation of hybrid materials 
requires extraordinary distance between atoms and between 
molecules, the creation of anisotropy, and approximation between 
materials. For this purpose, such methods as vacuum evaporation, 
plasma CVD, molecular beam epitaxy, ion sputtering, and ion 
injection are effective. In the future, the synthesis of hybrid 
film materials with various combinations of materials produced 
by different layering methods will be explored experimentally 
using ion beams. As a result of such efforts, materials with new 
functions, such as organic superconductivity based on the tunnel 
effects, will be developed. 
<H5>  (3) Use of Laser Beams </H5>
  The development of organic materials using lasers is in 
progress along with the spread of excimer laser. Excimer laser 
beams possess such properties as high durability, 
monochromatism, directionality, short pulse, etc., and are 
suitable for microprocessing. As an example of using a polymer 
material as the base, a polymer film was radiated with lasers to 
cause aberrations (a dispersing phenomenon of decomposed 
materials with impulsive sound and emission of light), and 
microprocessing at the level of microns on the surface of film 
was tried experimentally. One experiment involved inducing 
decomposed materials to accumulate on a wafer to produce a thin 
film. It is expected that such efforts will be applied to 
produce optoelectronic elements in the future. Furthermore, when 
ultraviolet-ray lasers are radiated on the surface of acrylic 
resin, moving the laser spot while radiating causes a hardened 
layer to form on the surface in the trace of the laser spot. By 
accumulating the layers, a more complex solid can be formed (the 
optical carving method). Its solution is about 0.1 Êm at 
present, and its application to the processing of micromachines 
is being examined by improving its precision. In addition, it is 
also noted that the carbon cluster molecule C60, which has 
attracted attention as a future functional material, is produced 
by laser beam evaporation. 
<H5>  3. Inorganic Materials </H5>
  Use of ion beams, along with other energy beams, brings 
about 
radical changes in material structures. Electronic excitation 
and elastic diffusion processes cause crystalline materials to 
break their chemical linkage, and turn amorphous by atomic 
displacement. Such a state is one of disequilibrium, and 
presents solid state properties that are different from ordinary 
solid state properties. Table V-3 indicates typical property 
changes of inorganic materials turned amorphous by ion beam 
radiation. It shows that there are large effects, not only on 
optical properties, but also on electric and chemical 
properties. In this way, the use of energy beams facilitates 
basic property and space control, and its spin-off effects in 
materials development cannot be overestimated.

  Against this background, JAERI's Takasaki Radiation 
Chemistry 
Research Establishment has established Takasaki Ion 
Accelerations for Advanced Radiation Applications (TIARA), where 
ions of various elements in a broad range can be extracted. 
TIARA also has promoted research on the advanced use of 
radiation, such as the development of new materials. Figure V-4 
illustrates a typical system for ion beam processing mainly for 
inorganic materials. The system is capable of ion radiation and 
injection with temperature as a parameter and on-site ion beam 
analysis, which are important in material processing. As a means 
of additional processing after ion injection, ultrafast thermal 
processing on the order of several 10 ns by YAG lasers is 
possible. A goniometer also is installed for low-temperature ion 
channeling experiments, so that such data as location change on 
the atomic level of the injected elements, and the elements 
constituting the target materials can be obtained. Cooling can 
be controlled continuously within a range from 15 K to 300 K, 
and data on the interactions between the injected elements and 
radiation defects are needed for analysis of the state of 
material disequilibrium, which is an important feature of ion 
beam processing. This system will be established and made 
available for operation by December in 1993 as part of a 
compound beam use experiment consisting of middle-energy 
heavy-ion radiation equipment, low-energy ion radiation 
equipment, and middle-energy light-ion radiation equipment in 
the facilities of TIARA. 



  This section addresses metallic bond materials, ionic bond 
materials, and covalent materials as typical inorganic 
materials. Typical examples and the mechanism of basic 
functional addition are presented in terms of interactions 
between energy beams and materials. 
<H3>  (1) Improvement of Critical Current by Introduction of 
Electronic Excitation Defect </H3>
  As most of the energy added in the electronic excitation 
process becomes heat that is transformed to the lattice system 
in metallic materials, this process becomes important in 
compounds. Although lattice defects called color center are 
generated easily by ionizing radiation in alkali halides, 
lattice defects are generated by high-density electronic 
excitation by high-energy heavy-ion radiation in oxides. When 
incident ion energy reaches a level of about GeV, linear lattice 
defects (ion tracks) with a diameter of about 100 A expanded 
beyond the atomic unit can be introduced. These lattice defects 
effectively serve to pin magnetic flux in oxide high-temperature 
superconductors, and contribute to the rise of critical current. 
  Figure V-5 illustrates the results of changes in the 
critical 
current measured by the external magnetic field function and T 
after radiating Xe ions of 173 MeV at 77 K on a Y-group oxide 
high-temperature superconductor for 4 x 
10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] parallel to the C axis. As the 
figure indicates, when lattice defects (in the amorphous range) 
introduced by radiating Xe ions are parallel to the direction of 
the magnetic field, they increase critical current thereby 
serving as an effective pinning center. The strength of pinning 
is thought to be the largest when the size of the pinning center 
is about the same size as the coherent length of the material. 
This indicates that the high-energy heavy-ion radiation method 
is capable of controlling the direction, dose, and ionic 
species, and is an indispensable material processing method to 
upgrade research in critical current improvement for oxide 
superconductors. 



<H3>  (2) Improved Sensitivity of Image Memory Elements Using Spew 
Defects/Heterogeneous Element Introduction </H3>
  Here, enhancement of sensitivity in the memory process of 
optical images by introducing ion radiation lattice defects to 
PLZT (lead-lanthanum-zirconate-titanate) oxide superconductors 
is discussed. Defects are created in PLZT mainly by the 
displacement of constituent atoms in the elastic scattering 
process. Electrons captured by lattice defects induce optical 
current by the radiation of light needed to memorize optical 
images and to reduce the applied current needed for orientation 
change in the dielectric domain. In this way, by controlling 
ionic species and ionic energy, it becomes possible to introduce 
radiation defects adjusted at the energy level of the captured 
electrons at the location corresponding to the depth to which 
light for memory reaches. Therefore, image memory elements 
sensitive to light across a broad range of frequencies can be 
formed. 
  In Figure V-6, the inverse number of the light volume needed 
for image memory is defined as exposure sensitivity, and the 
results of measurements as a function of wavelength of light are 
illustrated. When Al and Ne are radiated at 500 keV for 
approximately 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/], exposure 
sensitivity is improved by two orders of magnitude, and 
wavelength dependency is removed. Therefore, image memory 
capability is enhanced. 



<H3>  (3) Addition of Electric Conductivity by Introduction of 
Heterogeneous Elements </H3>
  One-dimensional conductors can be created if it is possible 
to introduce metallic elements between subcrystal lattices 
consisting of metallic elements to constitute a compound. Ion 
injection, which is a means of processing amorphous materials, 
is effective in realizing this. The state of the materials thus 
obtained depends largely on injection temperature. For instance, 
when LiF crystals are injected with Na or K ions at 78 K, a 
broad absorption belt from visible to infrared light is formed, 
and this is totally different from the case of injection at 300 
K. It can be concluded from this light absorption phenomenon 
that a metal state linking the Li of the injected ions and the 
mother lattice in a chain is formed parallel to the surface. 
This continuous metal layer changes its structure by annealing 
and becomes discontinuous metal particles. 
  Figure V-7 illustrates change of conductance depending on 
the 
amount of K ion injection at 100 keV, and injection at 
approximately 2.9 x 10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] (approx. 
5%) increases it by six orders of magnitude. When the 
frequency 
dependency of alternating conductance is examined as a function 
of the amount of ionic injection, frequency dependency 
disappears at approximately 2.9 x 
10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. This is considered to be a 
nonmetal-metal transfer caused by one-dimensional contact of Li 
and K. 



<H3>  (4) Control of Chemical Response by Introduction of 
Heterogeneous Elements </H3>
  A considerable amount of research into the control of 
chemical response using the ion injection method has been 
conducted from the standpoint of catalytic materials, because 
ion injection causes alterations of the surface layer. Since the 
elements used as catalyzers are generally inactive, for 
instance, in the case of sapphire, it is necessary to inject 
ions into the sapphire and to stabilize the catalyzer element in 
the state of a high-speed response material into the crystal 
structure of sapphire in the heating process later on. The ion 
beam analysis method is used to analyze structural changes 
concentrated on the surface layer. 
  Figure V-8 illustrates the relationship between response 
speed and response time when hydrogen is added to toluene using 
hydrogen and sapphire processed in an oxygen atmosphere in 
advance. In the reaction, methylcyclohexane is generated. The 
radical rise of response speed in the heat processing test piece 
in the first 20 minutes is attributed to the formation of water 
by the remaining oxygen atoms, which affect the hydrogen adding 
process, and the real process is indicated with the dotted line. 
On the other hand, in the case of processing in a hydrogen 
atmosphere, indicated with the solid line, the response speed is 
reduced by almost one order of magnitude. When advance 
processing for individual catalyzers is compared, heat 
processing in an oxygen atmosphere produces certain results 
regardless of the manner of handling. 



<H3>  (5) Phase Separation and Crystallization Control by 
Introduction of Heterogeneous Elements </H3>
  The simultaneous introduction of heterogeneous elements and 
radiation defects to materials by both the ion injection method, 
and the consecutive phase separation process by heat processing, 
is an important part of crystallization control research for 
glass materials. Figure V-9 illustrates the distribution in 
depth of Li atoms obtained during heat processing after 
injecting Li ions at 50 keV for 1 x 
10[.sup]17[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] into SiO[.sup]2[/] glass. 
The distribution of Li atoms is a result obtained by an energy 
analysis of the recoil of Li atoms from elastic collisions with 
heavy ions ([.sup]28[/]Si) as a probe. Although the depth 
distribution of Li atoms is not changed by annealing at 
temperatures up to 873 K, they accumulate on the surface above 
that temperature as indicated in the figure. Along with the 
redistribution of Li, H atoms in the glass disperse internally 
and induce crystallization in the range of the injected Li ions. 
Since crystallization does not occur by injecting Si or O ions 
that constitute the glass network, the role of Li atoms 
themselves in crystallization has been concluded. As the amount 
of Li ion injection is large in this case, phase-separated 
Li[.sup]2[/]O prevents restoration of the glass network by 
SiO[.sup]4[/] tetrahedron formation, and functions instead as 
the core of single crystallization. Using such a method, 
SiO[.sup]2[/] glass could be crystallized at a far lower 
temperature than the 2,073 K needed for melting by controlling 
the depth and area. 



<H3>  (6) Application for Laser Radiation-Induced Phase Transfer 
and Data Memory </H3>
  Laser radiation of a semiconductor material with a small 
band 
gap generates fusion of the material by adding the excitation 
energy of the electronic system to the lattice system. When 
lasers with a pulse of several 10 ns are used, the material 
after fusing is cooled down at a ultrahigh speed, and it turns 
into an amorphous state. The amorphous state can be reversed to 
the original crystal state by longer laser radiation. The 
difference of reflectance between the crystal state and the 
amorphous state is expected to be large. Based on such results, 
detailed research on interaction between pulse lasers and 
materials is expected to be applied to the data memory process 
where repeated read and write are possible. 
  Figure V-10 is a diagram illustrating the radiation effects 
of pulse lasers on Te at 750 A evaporated on a glass base, and 
indicates the range where radiation-induced transformation of Te 
can occur as a function of incident power and pulse width. The 
solid line indicates the minimum laser radiation condition to 
reach the fusing point of Te (450ÎC). From this research, 
the conditions for crystallization and the consequent 
transformation to the amorphous state that are important for 
recording of data can be discovered.

<H5>  Part VI </H5>
  To further improve the reliability and safety of nuclear 
systems, and to develop new systems, it is indispensable to 
develop high-performance structural materials that offer superb 
durability in the severe nuclear environment. 
  Inorganic materials such as ceramics and carbon have far 
better properties than metal materials in terms of radiation 
resistance, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, abrasion 
resistance, reduction of radiation, insulation, etc. However, 
the use of single materials, even though their individual 
properties are superb, is limited in the nuclear environment, 
where many functions such as radiation resistance, strength at 
high temperatures, heat resistance, corrosion resistance, etc., 
are required simultaneously. In this context, compound materials 
that combine inorganic materials with high levels of heat 
resistance and durability have been noted as one kind of 
high-performance material. 
  At JAERI, research and development of high-performance 
compound materials has been conducted as a key technological 
issue. In this section we report on the current state of 
research and development for functionally gradient materials for 
the purpose of improving the oxidation resistance of carbon 
materials, which feature superb strength at high temperatures 
and superior neutron properties, as well as high-performance 
fibers for the purpose of improving the tenacity of ceramic 
materials with superb strength in high temperature and corrosion 
resistance. 
<H3>  1. Development of Oxidation-Resistant Carbon Materials by 
Gradient Composition </H3>
<H5>  (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development </H5>
  Because of their superb properties in high-temperature and 
nuclear environments, carbon materials have been used in a broad 
range of fields, including nuclear engineering, for instance, 
for the core structure of the HTTR being constructed by JAERI. 
At the same time, their lack of acid resistance in a 
high-temperature oxidation atmosphere has restricted their use. 
  In general, a surface coating is viewed as one way to 
improve 
acid resistance. However, when used for a long period of time, 
or in conditions of severe thermal stress, the coated layer may 
be removed from the base material by the stress concentrated on 
the phase boundary. This stress, in turn, is caused by the 
difference in thermal expansion factors of the coating and the 
base. Therefore, we have paid attention to gradient compound 
materials, which do not receive stress on specific places, and 
do not allow the surface layer to be removed easily. This is 
because such materials do not have a clear phase boundary 
between the coated layer and the base, because the density of 
the two materials varies gradually. The development of 
high-performance acid-resistant carbon materials is in progress. 
Such materials are expected to be applied in fields radically 
outside the nuclear field as well. 
  In the development of high-performance acid-resistant carbon 
materials, we selected silicon carbide (SiC) as the material for 
the acid-resistant surface layer. This is because SiC has the 
highest acid resistance and nuclear stability at 
1,500-1,600ÎC among carbides. SiC, a high-performance 
acid-resistant carbon material, and a gradient compound material 
(SiC/C gradient compound material) using a carbon base were 
produced in the following two processes. 
  [1] Process-1 
  Based on the porous property of a carbon material, a layer 
with a SiC density gradient (SiC/C) is formed from the surface 
to the inside of the carbon material using the diffusion 
response of gaseous SiO on the carbon material surface and the 
pores. 
  [2] Process-2 
  On the surface of the material with a SiC/C layer, SiC is 
coated with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. 
  In this report, the production method and evaluation testing 
in the current stage of SiC/C gradient compound material are 
discussed mainly for graphic materials. 
<H5>  (2) Production of SiC/C Gradient Component Materials </H5>
  i) Formation of SiC/C Layer 
  The reaction between SiO and carbon is used to form the 
SiC/C 
layer. SiO has a fusing point above 1,700ÎC, and is 
extremely easy to evaporate at high temperatures. This 
characteristic is used to form the SiC/C layer. Powdered SiO 
with a purity of 99.9 percent, which is commercially available, 
and a cylindrical graphite base material measuring 10mm in 
diameter and 20mm in length with rounded ends are used. The 
electric furnace used for the SiO and carbon reaction is a 
sealed type that uses siliconite as a heating element. The 
locations of the two materials in the reaction furnace are 
illustrated in Figure VI-1. The powdered SiO is evaporated after 
being heated to 1,300ÎC in highly purified helium, the 
carrier gas, and forms SiC by the following reaction with 
graphite heated to 1,380ÎC on the surface and in the pores: 
  SiO (gas) + 2C (solid) = SiC (solid) + CO 
(gas) [1] 



  The results show that SiC is distributed from the surface to 
the inside of the graphite material with a gradient density. The 
gasification temperature of 1,300ÎC for SiO, and the 
response temperature of 1,380ÎC in equation [1] were 
determined from the standpoint of the response speed. Due to the 
formation of SiC, an increase in the dimensions of the graphite 
material as a result of an increase in weight and volume was 
observed. 
  Although the temperature condition is different, an example 
of an increase in measurements of the graphite material as a 
result of an increase in weight and volume is illustrated in 
Figure VI-2. It also has been confirmed that the void content of 
the graphite material with the SiC/C layer increases along with 
the increase in weight compared to the base graphite. When the 
SiC density of the base increases as a result of excessive 
reaction, in other words, the increase in weight is over about 
2-3 percent (differs according to type of base materials), 
cracks occur near the surface. Since cracks occur easily at the 
ends, the ends are carved to prevent them from forming. The 
degree of reaction speed can be discovered by measuring the CO 
gas density generated in the equation [1] as needed. The SiC 
density of the graphite material is indicated by the increased 
weight after the reaction. 



  The SiC thus formed has been confirmed to be beta-SiC by 
X-ray diffraction. 
  ii) SiC Coating by CVD 
  A complete SiC/C gradient compound material is produced by 
coating SiC by CVD on the surface of the graphite material with 
the SiC/C layer. The basic temperature at the time of SiC 
coating by CVD must be lower than 1,380ÎC for the SiC/C 
layer formation to maintain the correct SiC density gradient. 
Coating of SiC targeted at 100 Êm is done externally. 
  Figure VI-3 is a conceptual presentation of Si distribution 
in the cross-sections of a SiC/C gradient compound material, a 
SiC-coated SiC/C material (SiC-SiC/C), and a SiC-coated graphite 
material (base graphite simply coated with SiC: SiC-C). Although 
there is a clear phase boundary as a border line between SiC and 
base graphite in ordinary SiC-coated graphite materials, there 
is no clear phase boundary as a border line in the SiC/C 
gradient compound material, and the SiC/C layer exists as a 
boundary layer between the SiC and the base graphite. 



<H5>  (3) Evaluation Test </H5>
  Oxidation testing and thermal cycle testing were used to 
evaluate the compound material. 
  i) Oxidation Testing 
  An oxidation test for SiC-SiC/C was conducted in the 
atmosphere at 800ÎC and 1,000ÎC. For the sake of 
comparison, graphite materials with only SiC-C or SiC/C layers 
(SiC/C) as well as the base graphite material were tested. The 
base graphite for the four types of materials was identical. 
Figure VI-4 illustrates weight reduction curves for the four 
materials. Weight reduction in the SiC coated materials, 
SiC-SiC/C, and SiC-C was nil in practice. SiC/C, the graphite 
material with the SiC/C layer but without the SiC coated layer, 
does not have the perfect oxidation resistance that can be 
observed in SiC coated materials, although some improvement can 
be made over other graphite materials. Figure VI-5 illustrates 
the appearance of the SiC/C and base graphite test pieces before 
and after oxidation for about 2.5 hours at 1,000ÎC. 






  The base graphite test piece is reduced in size (carbon and 
oxygen react with each other and produce CO[.sup]2[/] gas), 
but there is no change in the external view of SiC/C, even 
though there is reduction in weight of 76 percent. Because 
SiC/C, unlike SiC coated materials, is not covered with a SiC 
layer and is still a porous material, oxygen reacts with 
unreacted internal carbon (carbon not yet turned to SiC) through 
pores. Porous diffusion of oxygen is easier with SiC/C, which 
has a high level of porosity, than with the base graphite. 
Although there is no change in the external view due to a lack 
of oxidation in the SiC portion of the SiC/C layer, it is 
internally oxidized. Even though it is possible to produce SiC/C 
with different SiC density by varying the response temperature 
and time in equation [1], the reaction of oxygen with unreacted 
internal carbon cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is necessary to 
coat the SiC/C surface with SiC further, and to turn it to 
SiC-SiC/C if more severe oxidation resistance is required. 
  Based on a detailed examination of SiC behavior, an 
extremely 
thin and stable SiO[.sup]2[/] layer is formed on SiC by the 
following reaction: 
  SiC (solid) + 20[.sup]2[/] (gas) = SiO[.sub]2[/] 
(solid) + CO[.sup]2[/] (gas) [2] 
  up to 1,000Î, and the oxidation resistance of SiC is 
believed to be maintained. 
  ii) Thermal Cycle Testing 
  The evaluation test for thermal cycle resistance properties 
was conducted for SiC-SiC/C and SiC-C coated with SiC by CVD. 
The method of the thermal cycle test was as follows. First, as a 
preliminary heating process, it was heated at 800-1,000ÎC in 
the atmosphere for several hours to verify the soundness of the 
SiC coated layer. Then, those test pieces with a sound coated 
layer were heated to 1,000ÎC or 1,200ÎC at the speed of 
20ÎC per second. Next, after maintaining them at that 
temperature for 5 minutes, they were dropped into pure water at 
20ÎC. In order to evaluate the soundness of the test pieces 
after testing, isothermal heating was conducted for one hour in 
the atmosphere at 800ÎC after each cycle, and any changes in 
weight were measured. When cracks in the SiC coated layer or 
exfoliation of the layer is caused by the heat cycle, the test 
piece loses weight due to a reaction of oxygen and the base 
graphite through the damaged section by isothermal heating. 
Thermal cycle and isothermal heating were repeated until the 
weight reduction rate, where the coated layer was damaged, 
reached about 10 percent. 
  Figure VI-6 illustrates a typical example of a test piece 
where the coated layer is damaged, and the internal graphite 
base is oxidized. Figure VI-7 illustrates weight reduction 
curves for three kinds of SiC-SiC/C (with different SiC density 
in SiC/C) and SiC-C. A list of preliminary thermal process 
conditions to verify the soundness of SiC coated layers, and a 
suitable retaining temperature for thermal cycle testing 
concerning the test pieces a-j in Figure VI-6 are presented in 
Table VI-1. Although differences in the behavior of the three 
types of SiC-SiC/C cannot be accounted for, they clearly are due 
to different SiC densities in individual SiC/C elements, and to 
different preliminary thermal process conditions prior to 
thermal cycle testing. The figure indicates that the thermal 
cycle resistance properties are far more stable than those for 
SiC/C.

  Cracks that can be located with the naked eye occurred on 
the 
surface of all SiC-C pieces after the first thermal cycle, but 
observable cracks did not occur in SiC-SiC/C until immediately 
before damage took place. Figure VI-8 indicates the surface 
conditions of SiC-C (test piece: g) after the fourth thermal 
cycle, and isothermal heating and SiC-SiC/C (test piece: h) 
after fifth thermal cycle and isothermal heating as examples. 
There are many cracks in SiC-C. 



  The thermal expansion factors of beta-SiC and the base 
graphite (marketed under the trade name of IG-110) are 4.7 x 
10[.sup]-6[/]/K (293-2,400 K) and 4.06 x 10[.sup]-6[/]/K 
(293-673 K), respectively. As Figure VI-3 indicates, a phase 
boundary of heterogeneous materials exists between the 
SiC-coated layer and the base graphite in SiC-C, but there is no 
clear phase boundary in SiC-SiC/C. In other words, since the 
phase boundary between heterogeneous materials exists not as a 
line but as a layer in SiC-SiC/C, stress tends not to 
concentrate in specific places. Therefore, it can be said that 
the SiC coated layer of SiC-SiC/C expresses stable properties 
even under thermal cycles. 
  iii) Miscellaneous 
  Strength properties are an important evaluation item if the 
SiC/C gradient compound material (SiC-SiC/C) is to be put to 
practical use as a structural material. Concerning the effects 
of the SiC/C layer on the strength properties of the base 
graphite at room temperature, a preliminary examination was 
conducted. As a result of the examination, it was confirmed that 
the strength of the graphite material with the SiC/C layer was 
equivalent to or greater than that of the base material without 
depending on the weight increase factor, or SiC density, if the 
weight increase factor was below 2 percent, or within the range 
where cracks were not created at the time of SiC/C layer 
formation. Figure VI-9 illustrates the bending strength of 
IG-110 graphite with a SiC/C layer in comparison with the base 
IG-110. 



<H5>  (4) Conclusion and Future Perspectives </H5>
  The development of a SiC/C gradient compound material from 
which an oxidation-resistant SiC surface layer is hard to 
exfoliate has been conducted for the purpose of improving the 
oxidation resistance of carbon materials. Using the reaction 
between gaseous SiO and carbon, a SiC/C gradient compound layer 
was formed in the graphite material. Using the graphite material 
as the base, a SiC/C gradient compound graphite material 
consisting of a SiC-coated layer produced by CVD, a SiC/C 
gradient compound layer, and the graphite base was successfully 
produced. According to an evaluation of its oxidation and 
thermal cycle resistance properties, it displayed a level of 
oxidation resistance equivalent to SiC coated graphite, and a 
thermal cycle resistance far more stable than that of SiC coated 
graphite. 
  To date, only three experimental pieces of SiC/C gradient 
compound graphite material have been produced and evaluated. We 
have good prospects for the development of a high-performance 
oxidation-resistant graphite material. We will continue our 
research on how the SiC density of the base SiC/C layer affects 
the stability of the surface SiC layer, and on the long-term 
stability of SiC/C density gradient. Also, we will try to put 
the material to practical use. It has been confirmed that the 
SiC/C layer formation method based on the reaction in the 
equation [1], which is used for the graphite material, also can 
be applied to both carbon materials and carbon fiber reinforced 
compound materials (so-called C/C compounds). We plan to use the 
surface SiC coating by CVD technique to produce a SiC coated 
layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-carbon base, a SiC coated 
layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-C/C compound base, and a 
SiC/C gradient compound C/C compound material. We will conduct 
evaluation tests on these materials. 
<H3>  2. Development of Highly Thermal-Resistant Silicon Carbide 
Long Fiber </H3>
<H5>  (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development </H5>
  Although ceramics have superb properties in the areas of 
heat 
resistance, reduction of radiation, and corrosion resistance, 
their lack of fracture toughness presents a problem in terms of 
reliability. In order to improve their fracture toughness, 
research and development of a fiber-reinforced compound ceramics 
material (FRC) is being considered. 
  There are many ceramics, ranging from porcelain, which has a 
long history, to the recently developed fine ceramics. However, 
there is only a limited number of reinforcing fibers, such as 
alumina fibers, silicon carbide fibers, and zirconia fibers. 
Although glass fibers and carbon fibers are used widely as 
reinforcement fibers for plastic, glass fibers and carbon fibers 
cannot be used directly as reinforcement fibers for ceramics 
because of their heat resistance and reactions to ceramics, 
respectively. Normally, compounding and molding of ceramics are 
done at high temperatures between 10,000 and 20,000ÎC. It is 
also necessary to mold fiber-reinforced compound materials at 
high temperatures, and thus the development of reinforcing 
fibers that can be processed at such high temperatures is 
expected. 
  It is anticipated that silicon carbide (SiC) fibers can be 
used as reinforcement fibers for ceramic compounds. The SiC 
fiber was invented by Yajima, et al., of the Research Institute 
for Iron, Steel, and Other Materials of Tohoku University. In 
their method, polycarbosilane (PCS) fiber, an organic silicon 
polymer, is used as a precursor. After it is processed to make 
it infusible by thermal oxidation in the process illustrated in 
Figure VI-10, it is baked to produce fibers. The SiC fiber 
obtained by this thermal oxidation method is known as "Nikaron," 
while the SiC fiber obtained by the same method using 
polytitanocarbosilane compounded with polycarbosilane and a few 
percent of titanium is called "Tilano." These fibers have a high 
level of flexibility, strength, and oxidation resistance, and 
their maximum heat resistance is 1,200ÎC. Therefore, their 
application as reinforcing fibers for compound materials is 
limited, and they are used only to reinforce materials with a 
relatively low melting temperature, such as glass for FRC, and 
to reinforce aluminum for metal compounds. 



  The heat resistance of SiC fibers must be improved if they 
are to be used for the development of heat-resistant compound 
materials. "Nikaron" and "Tilano" as marketed at present, begin 
to decompose at 1,200ÎC. This most likely is because of the 
oxygen included in the SiC. A process to make PCS fiber 
infusible is essential to maintain the fiber form in the ceramic 
production process. If this is done by thermal oxidation, oxygen 
is introduced into SiC fiber after burning, and its density 
increases by 10 percent in weight. To reduce the oxygen level, a 
method to make the fibers infusible by using radiation was 
examined. As a result of developing infusibility technology 
based on the study of the effects of radiation on PCS, SiC 
fibers with far greater heat resistance than expected were 
obtained. The following describes the properties of the SiC 
fibers obtained in this research and development effort. 
<H3>  (2) Production Technology for Silicon Carbide Fiber Using 
Radiation </H3>
  i) Radiation Method 
  We developed a method to process silicon polymer (PCS) fiber 
to make it infusible (a process to maintain the fiber form by 
heating it to a temperature higher than the fusing point of the 
fiber) by irradiating it. When organic polymers are irradiated, 
a covalent-bonded molecular chain is either cut off or forms new 
bonds with another molecular chain. 
  The reactions that occurred with PCS were examined by using [.sup]60 
[/] 
Cogamma ray radiation. The results show that 
radiation in a vacuum at room temperature resulted in the 
emission of hydrogen (H[.sup]2[/]) and methane 
(CH[.sup]4[/]), and cross-linking was promoted. Meanwhile, 
radiation in an oxygen atmosphere at room temperature resulted 
in the emission of oxidative destruction products, carbon 
dioxide, and water. Also, oxygen was absorbed extensively 
compared to the amount emitted. Infusibility processing can be 
conducted in this case as well, and oxygen density can be 
controlled and varied between 3 and 25 percent. The amount of 
oxidation induced by PCS radiation is 10 times higher than that 
of hydrocarbon polymers, such as polyethylene. This indicates 
that PCS, including silicon atoms, is extremely susceptible to 
oxidation. 
  When PCS is subjected to gamma rays in a vacuum, it becomes 
infusible by cross-linking, but reaction activity (radicals) 
still remains, and exposure to air promotes rapid oxidation as 
well as the intake of oxygen. Therefore, we have developed an 
infusibility process that does not introduce oxygen by 
eliminating the remaining oxygen while implementing 
stabilization processing to prevent oxidation in the air. It is 
known that there is no difference between gamma rays and 
electrons in terms of the radiation effects on organic polymers. 
It has been confirmed that electron and gamma ray radiation 
produce a cross-linking reaction in PCS fiber. 
  ii) Development of Production Technology 
  PCS fiber can be rendered infusible without oxygen by 
radiation in a vacuum, but this process requires a dose of 15 
MGy. Although gamma radiation can be used for large amounts of 
PCS fibers at a time, the radiation speed (dose rate) is about 
10 kGy/h at the maximum. This is unrealistic in practical terms 
as it would require 1,500 hours of radiation. Therefore, 
electron radiation by electronic accelerators was examined for 
practical application. Although electronic accelerators are 
capable of producing large doses of radiation in a short time, 
it is necessary that the items being radiated are thin as its 
transmittivity is small. As illustrated in Figure VI-11, we have 
developed a method to spool fiber on a bobbin (30 cm in diameter 
and 30 cm in width), and to radiate the spinning bobbin in the 
radiation container. The electron accelerator used here operates 
at a current of 2 MeV, and is capable of radiating electron 
beams at a maximum of 30 mA with a scanning width of 120 cm. As 
the effective transmittivity of the electronic beams is 0.6 
g/cm[.sup]2[/], the maximum thickness of the PCS fiber is 0.6 
g/cm[.sup]2[/]. Therefore, the maximum amount of PCS fiber 
that can be radiated at a time with the bobbin in Figure VI-11 
is about 1.5 kg. 



  However, a dose of 15 MGy means that 15 MJ of energy is 
applied to 1 kg of fiber, and most of this energy is transformed 
to thermal energy. Therefore, if the PCS fiber being radiated is 
not sufficiently cooled, the fiber will melt with the heat from 
the electrons. For efficient cooling, helium gas was used as the 
atmosphere during radiation, and the helium gas was cooled with 
a heat exchanger. This method made it possible to achieve 
infusibility for a maximum of 4.5 kg of PCS fiber by irradiating 
it for four hours, which demonstrates the prospect of practical 
application. 
<H5>  (3) Properties of Silicon Carbide Fiber </H5>
  After PCS fiber is made infusible by radiation and thermal 
oxidation, it is processed with heat up to 1,200ÎC in an 
inactive gas flow. Then, it emits H[.sup]2[/] and 
CH[.sup]4[/], and is transformed into ceramic SiC fiber. The 
SiC fiber obtained at this temperature has an amorphous 
structure with a density between 2.5 and 2.6. The strength of 
the fiber does not depend much on the oxygen content, and shows 
a value of 2.5-3.0 GPa (100 kg/mm[.sup]2[/]). When this SiC 
fiber is processed with heat up to 1,500ÎC in argon gas, the 
fiber with a low oxygen content does not change its form or 
strength, but the density rises slightly to about 2.7. 
  Meanwhile, when the oxygen density increases, its strength 
drops radically, although the fiber form is maintained. 
Examination with a scanning electron microscope shows that the 
higher oxygen density generates particles on the surface of the 
fiber, and that decomposition is taking place as illustrated in 
Figure VI-12. Decomposition is particularly prominent in the SiC 
fiber with 10 percent oxygen produced by thermal oxidation 
infusibility. The oxygen density indicated in the figure is 
expressed in percent by weight based on an element analysis of 
SiC fiber. The fiber processed with heat after electron 
radiation is the lowest at 0.4 percent. The oxygen density at 
1.4 and 2.3 percent indicates insufficient heat processing after 
radiation. Since PCS fiber as a material contains about 0.2-0.3 
percent oxygen as an impurity, the oxygen density of the SiC 
fiber after burning becomes almost 0.4 percent without 
additional oxygen in the infusibility process. 



  Figure VI-13 consists of scanning electron microscope 
photographs of low-oxygen SiC fiber being processed by heat up 
to 2,000ÎC in argon gas. Although there is no change in the 
fiber with 0.4 percent oxygen, the surface of the fiber with 1.4 
percent oxygen is coarse, and large crystallized particles can 
be observed between fibers. The results of an X-ray diffraction 
analysis of the structure of the crystals are illustrated in 
Figure VI-14. Those with a higher oxygen density present 
diffraction images equivalent to single SiC crystals (_b_-SiC). 






  In SiC with a lower oxygen density, however, particle growth 
is slow, and the fiber form is maintained, although crystals are 
formed. Figure VI-15 illustrates the oxygen density and 
carbon/silicon ratio by thermal processing, and it indicates the 
disjunction of oxygen and carbon beginning around 1,400ÎC. 
This is because oxygen that has combined with silicon atoms is 
released. It then reacts with excessive carbon, and is emitted 
as carbon monoxide (CO) gas. SiC that remains in thermal 
decomposition develops into crystallized particles and becomes 
deposited between fibers, as illustrated in Figure VI-13. 
Although element composition does not change in samples with 
small oxygen density up to 2,000ÎC without thermal 
decomposition, crystallization takes place gradually. 



  Figure VI-16 illustrates the relationship between strength 
and elastic coefficient of the fiber with the least oxygen 
density at 0.4 percent in a tension test at room temperature 
after thermal processing in argon gas at various temperatures. 
Reduction of strength is extremely small up to about 
1,700ÎC, and elastic coefficient begins to decrease beyond 
1,900ÎC. When the results are compared with "Nikaron," which 
is rendered infusible by thermal oxidation, heat resistance has 
been improved by 500ÎC in the range of dynamic properties. 
Table VI-2 indicates representative property values of SiC fiber 
with a low oxygen density obtained in the infusibility process 
by thermal oxidation.

<H5>  (4) Problems and Perspectives </H5>
  A method in which radiation is used to produce highly 
heat-resistant silicon carbide fiber has been found, and 
technological development aimed at its practical application has 
been prepared. An experiment using this technology for 
production on a scale of one ton per month is in progress at 
Research Development Corporation, and it is expected to be 
completed at the end of FY 1994. 
  For the future, we anticipate the development of 
fiber-reinforced compound materials using this newly developed 
fiber. Silicon carbide fiber obtained by radiation can endure a 
high temperature of 1,700ÎC for a short time. The range of 
matrix materials will expand, and it can be compounded with 
ceramics. The initial items of examination include 
compatibility, reactions, and deference in thermal expansion 
between compound materials and this fiber. The next item is the 
development of compound technology. Superb inspiration and its 
efficient execution will be needed in this unknown field. The 
situation will differ depending on whether the matrix is metal 
or ceramics, but in each case this will be key basic research 
worth our efforts because of its variety. 
  The application of new materials to the nuclear field 
becomes 
possible only when technological development of compound 
materials expands. A broad range of uses is expected for 
enhanced light-water reactors; nuclear fusion reactor materials; 
aeronautic and space materials, including rockets; and 
heat-resistant materials, including gas turbines. 
<H5>  3. Conclusion </H5>
  We have reported on concrete developments in key 
technological research concerning compound materials, noting 
that high-performance oxidation-resistant graphite materials, as 
well as a production method for high-performance silicon carbide 
fiber, have been developed. 
  The development of high-performance oxidation-resistant 
graphite materials leads to the enhancement of all carbon 
materials, and the development of high-performance silicon 
carbide fiber will lead to the development of fiber-reinforced 
metal and ceramic compound materials. 
  Our dream expands to the development of gradient composite 
silicon carbide fiber compound materials -- the ultimate 
compound materials -- by reinforcing the base material with 
silicon carbide fiber gradiently compounded with 
environment-resistant materials.

<H5>  Part VII (1) </H5>
  The development of various nuclear systems, including 
nuclear 
fusion systems, involves a variety of issues concerning 
materials. The basic issues that are common to all of them, 
however, are the analysis of various phenomena involving 
radioactivity, and the creation of materials that are resistant 
to deterioration caused by radiation. There are a number of 
methods for conducting irradiation experiments on materials. 
These include electron irradiation, ion irradiation, and nuclear 
fission reactor or nuclear spallation neutron irradiation, but 
research on neutron irradiation is of particular importance. 
Because neutrons generate activation, there are a number of 
restrictions and barriers to the establishment of remote-control 
experiment methods and the implementation of research on 
irradiation control. Since there are not sufficient means of 
heavy irradiation or post-irradiation testing in Japan, we need 
to depend largely on overseas facilities. Also, we do not have a 
sufficient number of researchers. It is, therefore, 
indispensable as an emphasized policy to establish irradiation 
and testing facilities with powerful new functions. 
  In the development of nuclear fusion reactor materials, in 
particular, gaseous nuclear transformation products, H and He, 
that affect various proprieties of the reactor materials, 
including displacements per atom (dpa), are produced 
simultaneously in large amounts, one or two orders of magnitude 
more than in fission reactors. This is because the neutron 
energy as well as radiation dose in the interaction between 
high-energy neutrons and materials is about one order of 
magnitude larger at 14 MeV than in nuclear fission reactors. 
  High-energy and high-flux neutron irradiation facilities are 
necessary for precise forecasts of phenomena peculiar to such 
high-energy neutron irradiation, and to the development of 
durable materials, but no such facility exists anywhere in the 
world. Therefore, irradiation by electrons and ions has been 
used in the basic stage, and experiments that simulate the 
irradiation effects of high-energy neutrons has been conducted. 
The triple/dual beam system installed in the Takasaki Ion 
Irradiation Facility for Radiation Applications (TIARA) of 
JAERI's Takasaki Radiation Chemistry Research Establishment, 
among others, is expected to contribute to our ability to 
forecast three events simultaneously -- displacement damage by 
elastic collision, helium generated by nuclear transformation 
reactions, and the generation of hydrogen, as well as the 
interactions derived from them. 
  At the basic engineering stage, the spectrum coordinated 
heavy irradiation experiment (HFIR/ORR Project) has been 
conducted based on a cooperative design between Japan (JAERI) 
and the United States (ORNL). Figure VII (1)-1 illustrates the 
effects of high-energy neutrons on materials in a 
three-dimensional manner. Since existing testing equipment, such 
as nuclear reactors, is limited in spite of its usefulness, we 
would expect the establishment of a means for high-energy 
neutron irradiation as soon as possible. 



  In this section, we will survey the project for the Energy 
Selective Neutron Irradiation Test Facility (ESNIT), a 
one-of-a-kind high-energy neutron irradiation test facility, and 
the ion irradiation test facility of the Takasaki Radiation 
Chemistry Research Establishment, which makes it possible to 
simulate the behavior of materials in the environment of nuclear 
fusion reactor irradiation. 
<H3>  1. Project for Energy Selective Neutron Irradiation Test 
Facility (ESNIT) for Materials Research </H3>
  The first experiment to design and develop a testing 
facility 
for materials irradiation research on a full scale using a 
neutron source other than nuclear reactors was the Fusion 
Material Irradiation Test Facility (FMIT) project in the United 
States. The project was implemented with strategic judgment 
given that there was no existing means to properly approximate 
either the importance of materials in the development of nuclear 
fusion nor the material irradiation effects caused by heavy 
doses of radiation from high-energy neutrons peculiar to nuclear 
fusion. However, due to changes in the political environment, 
the project was discontinued in the mid-1980s. 
  Activities to secure the means of material irradiation 
testing in the field of nuclear fusion after FMIT development 
(1978-1985) remained within the framework of concept 
examination, and materials research was conducted by an indirect 
approach in which experiments were conducted using alternative 
means supplemented with analytical tools. For the past few 
years, activities have continued internationally under the 
nuclear fusion materials development agreement of the IEA. In 
other words, a conceptual target system, the International 
Fusion Material Irradiation Facility (IFMIF), has been assumed, 
and its ideal specifications have been examined. As candidates 
for IFMIF, an accelerator neutron source and a plasma beam 
neutron source, based on the d-Li stripping reaction and the 
sporation reaction, have been proposed. As a result of 
technological examinations conducted since 1989, it has been 
concluded that the only irradiation device that can be built in 
the near future, and that will meet the requirement of IFMIF, is 
for the time being a d-Li accelerator neutron irradiation device. 
  In Japan, materials development was included as one of the 
major elements of the key technology research program at the 
time of designating the Long-Term Plan for Nuclear Development 
and Use for FY 1987. It was pointed out then that analysis of 
phenomena related to the interaction between materials and 
neutrons, as well as the development of superb materials based 
on this analysis, was an issue of urgency and importance. As one 
of its concrete policies, JAERI proposed an energy selective 
neutron irradiation test facility for materials research based 
on a heavy proton accelerator to function as an innovative 
general-purpose facility for materials research. Since then, 
establishment of the concept, and technological examinations 
have been implemented in consultation with experts inside and 
outside of Japan. 
  ESNIT is a neutron irradiation test facility that integrates 
the neutron source based on the d-Li stripping reaction with the 
same principle as FMIT, on-site test equipment by remote 
control, and a hot cell (modular hot laboratory) based on a new 
concept in a cassette. Its characteristics are that materials 
testing can be conducted in an irradiation field characterized 
by high neutron energy and high neutron flux, and that the 
neutron energy spectrum of the irradiation field created by this 
neutron source has a peak between about 5 and 15 MeV, as well as 
selectivity of the peak energy. It is extremely important to 
establish test space for selectivity of neutron energy, high 
neutron flux, and high radiation doses in complementing the 
properties lacking in irradiation by the conventional nuclear 
reactors. Such a facility is expected to be the basic means of 
research, in addition to research reactors. ESNIT was considered 
at the beginning "to be intended to reinforce key material 
research, including nuclear fusion materials research." At 
present, it is considered to be "one realistic stage to realize 
IFMIF on a full scale," as heavy irradiation testing by neutrons 
in this energy range is indispensable for the development of 
materials for use in nuclear fusion reactors. 
  Figure VII (1)-2 illustrates the concept of ESNIT, which 
consists of [1] the accelerator system, [2] the target system, 
and [3] the testing system. Figure VII (1)-3 depicts the 
conceptual configuration of the accelerator system, the target 
system and the testing system, and their primary specifications 
are presented in Table VII (1)-1. Figure VII (1)-4 illustrates 
the neutron energy spectrum expected in ESNIT in comparison with 
the neutron energy spectrum of compound spectrum reactors 
(HFIR), fast breeder reactors (EBR-11), nuclear spallation 
neutron irradiation facilities (LAMPF), etc. Figure VII (1)-5 
illustrates the neutron energy spectrum generated as a result of 
accelerating deuteron energy change. By changing deuteron 
acceleration energy from 40 MeV to 10 MeV, it should be possible 
to obtain a neutron energy spectrum with a peak between 15 MeV 
and 5 MeV.

10[.sup]14[/]n/cm[.sup]2[/]s, or an irradiation field of 
5,800 cm[.sup]3[/] for neutron flux over 
10[.sup]13[/]n/cm[.sup]2[/]s, can be secured (Table VII 
(1)-2). This makes it possible to conduct research on the 
interrelationship between neutrons and neutron radiation, which 
is a basic key to research on materials. It also makes it 
possible to conduct neutron flux on-site experiments that 
correspond to the neutron barrier load of the nuclear fusion 
demonstration reactor for nuclear fusion reactor materials 
development, as well as life time evaluation testing, although 
there is a limit in the number of test pieces due to the 
restriction on irradiation volume. Although there is restriction 
on the test volume for the accelerator neutron source as 
indicated in Table VII (1)-2, the development of irradiation 
technology using micro test pieces is under way as an effective 
means to solve such a problem.

  ESNIT is significant not only as a means of effectively 
solving the problem of materials for use in the high-energy 
neutron range, where conventional nuclear reactors could not 
serve, but also for application in a nuclear fusion reactor 
material irradiation facility. Since the d-Li method is equipped 
with the most advanced technology available, it can be viewed as 
the only facility plan suitable for such objectives. Compared to 
FMIT, as the generated neutron peak energy is varied, the 
nonlinear contribution of the nuclear transformation reaction 
that occurs in the high-energy range can be arranged 
systematically from an experimental standpoint. It also will 
provide a hint as to how to solve the problem presented by the 
effect of the so-called high-energy tail, which is an issue that 
needs to be examined to approximate the neutron environment of 
nuclear fusion reactors with a maximum energy of 14 MeV. The 
amount of radiation, which is an inherent part of the 
accelerator neutron source, can also be increased 
technologically, and there is a sufficient possibility of 
fulfilling the conditions for an ideal image of IFMIF. 
<H3>  2. Ion Irradiation Test Facility for Nuclear Fusion Reactor 
Irradiation Environment Simulation (Triple- and Dual-Beam 
Systems) </H3>
  In conducting experiments designed to simulate the 
irradiation effects of high-energy neutrons, it is important to 
establish quantitative scaling rules by analyzing three events 
simultaneously -- displacement damage caused by elastic 
collisions, helium generated by nuclear transformation 
reactions, and the generation of hydrogen, as well as 
interactions derived from them. 
  For this reason, three pieces of equipment -- a 
medium-energy 
heavy ion irradiation device (3 MV tandem accelerator), a 
low-energy ion irradiation device (400 kV ion injector), and a 
medium-energy light ion irradiation device (3 MV single end 
accelerator) -- have been established at the Takasaki Ion 
Irradiation Facility for Radiation Applications (TIARA) of 
JAERI's Takasaki Radiation Chemistry Research Establishment. 
During the second half of the current fiscal year, vacuum 
chambers for irradiation testing will be connected to each set 
equipment, and irradiation experiments will begin. Ion beams 
from these irradiation devices are used mainly for a triple-beam 
system for on-site analysis of the ion irradiation process, and 
for a triple-beam system that implements simulated irradiation 
experiments by producing the three types of ion beams mentioned 
above. 
  A summary of the three types of ion irradiation devices, 
which constitute the core of TIARA; the features of the triple- 
and dual-beam systems; and the various beam experiments that can 
be done will be discussed. 
<H5>  (1) Ion Irradiation Equipment </H5>
  A series of ion irradiation devices are arranged as 
illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6. Individual irradiation devices 
and corresponding beam lines are separated in three major areas 
so that they can be used individually or in conjunction. The 
irradiation room for the dual- and triple-beam systems to be 
discussed here corresponds to the second target room in the 
center. It indicates the locations of the beam line, where MD1 
and MD2 are used for the dual-beam system, and MT1 is used for 
the triple-beam system, and the vacuum chamber for irradiation. 
Control for the three types of irradiation equipment is 
integrated in the control room, and its system makes possible 
the simultaneous generation and irradiation of ions. Transport 
and irradiation of beams are conducted by a digital remote 
control method that makes it possible to implement reproducible 
irradiation experiments. 



  The medium-energy heavy ion irradiation device is located in 
the upper left corner in Figure VII (1)-6. It is a 9SDH-2 tandem 
electrostatic accelerator with a terminal voltage of 3 MV. It is 
made by NEC, America. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-3, it has 
two types of ion sources, the sputter and RF types, and 
basically it can accelerate almost all ions with the exception 
of inert gas ions from heavy elements above Ne. The gas 
stripping mechanism is used for charge conversion, and the 
acceleration voltage is 0.4-3.0 MV. By selecting the charge 
state, it is possible to implement irradiation testing using 
ions with a broad range of energy that typically is between 1 
and 14-15 MeV. The maximum ion current is between 1 and 14-15 
ÊA, and it is possible to introduce suitable amounts of 
lattice defect and heterogeneous elements to simulate the 
nuclear fusion irradiation environment.

  The low-energy ion irradiation equipment is located in the 
center of Figure VII (1)-6. It is an NH-40 SR ion injection 
research accelerator of the Cockcroft type made by Nisshin 
Electric. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-4, it can vary 
acceleration voltage continually in the range of 10-400 kV. This 
accelerator has a Freeman-type ion source equipped with sputter 
capability, and can generate almost all ion species from H to 
Bi. This is especially suitable for injection simulation 
experiments for nuclear transformation products as most inert 
gas ions can be extracted at high currents of several 10 ÊA. 
However, it does not accelerate heavy hydrogen ions due to a 
restriction concerning radioactivity protection.

  The medium-energy light ion irradiation device is located on 
the right end of Figure VII (1)-6. It is an NC-3000B accelerator 
of the Schenkel type with a terminal voltage of 3 MV. It is made 
by Nisshin Electric. As illustrated in Table VII (1)-5, it can 
vary acceleration voltage continually in a range of +/- 0.4-3.0, 
and electrons can be accelerated. It has far higher accelerated 
vantage stability at +/- 1 x 10 [.sup]approx. 5[/] than the 
other two accelerators. In addition, as the ion source is 
designed specifically for light element gas, a high current can 
be extracted. It is, therefore, an appropriate device for ion 
beam analysis experiments, providing a superb parallel property 
free from the massive injection of light elements and energy 
dispersion. As electron irradiation can be implemented, this 
accelerator can provide a place for simple irradiation defect 
research at ultralow temperatures, which forms the base for the 
nuclear fusion reactor irradiation environment simulated for 
irradiation experiments.

<H5>  (2) Triple-Beam System </H5>
  As illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6, the triple beam system 
consists of vacuum chambers to implement simultaneous injection 
of three types of ions, and is capable of irradiating the 
designated area uniformly by scanning the beams from each 
irradiation device. 
  As discussed earlier, in nuclear fusion reactor systems one 
must take into account deterioration of structural materials, 
breeding materials, and special purpose materials due to lattice 
defects; the simultaneous generation of helium and hydrogen; and 
the interaction of these phenomena. In order to evaluate such 
deterioration quantitatively in a short time, it is necessary to 
gain an understanding of the deterioration of mechanical 
properties, and the alteration of micro-organisms (such as 
generation and change of transfer, formation of deposits, void 
formation, etc.) that cause changes in measurements as functions 
of H and He/dpa. This can be accomplished by implementing triple 
beam irradiation experiments in which H ions and He ions are 
injected simultaneously while providing slinging damage with 
heavy ion irradiation. 
  With regard to structural materials, taking stainless steel 
as an example, slinging damage by Fe or Ni ions is caused by 
ions from the medium-energy heavy ion irradiation. He and H ions 
are acceleration-injected by the medium-energy light ion 
irradiation equipment, as well as the low-energy ion irradiation 
device. The advantage of using the triple-beam system is that 
the ratio of He, H, and dpa can be adjusted as needed. 
  The condition needed for an experiment to simulate 
irradiation damage in tritium breeding material is almost the 
same. The specific irradiation condition for 
Li[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] is that the simultaneous 
irradiation of O ions at 3-5 MeV, He ions at 1.0-1.5 MeV, and H 
ions at 0.3-0.4 MeV makes it possible to conduct a detailed 
analysis of the interaction of the ions in the solid. As the 
current for individual ions can be varied separately, simulated 
irradiation experiments corresponding to various neutron spectra 
become possible. 
  Micro-organisms are observed in local domains in triple beam 
experiments. Together with irradiation from high-energy 
longer-range H and He ions, uniform slinging damage and helium 
introduction in the direction of depth of the target material 
will be conducted, and changes in its bulk properties will be 
measured. 
<H5>  (3) Dual-Beam System </H5>
  The dual-beam system consists of two types of vacuum 
chambers 
located at MD1 and MD2, as illustrated in Figure VII (1)-6. MD1 
is connected to the medium-energy heavy ion irradiation device, 
as well as to the low-energy ion irradiation device, and MD2 is 
connected to the medium-energy light ion irradiation device, as 
well as to the low-energy ion irradiation device. The basic 
specifications for both vacuum chambers are designed equally, 
and structural changes in the surface as a result of ion 
irradiation from the low-energy ion irradiation device can be 
analyzed on site simultaneously or continually using the ions 
from the medium-energy light and heavy ion irradiation devices. 
As already mentioned, an understanding of the ion irradiation 
damage process on the atomic level is indispensable for a 
quantitative analysis of simulation test of the nuclear fusion 
irradiation environment. Therefore, the dual-beam system, which 
enables ion beam analysis of irradiation temperatures -- an 
important factor controlling the microstructure of irradiation 
defects -- varying continually from 15 K to 300 K has been 
developed. By implementing channeling experiments using single 
crystal test pieces, it becomes possible to extract 
crystallographic information concerning the coupling condition 
of irradiation defects and impurities using temperature as a 
parameter. Such experiments make it possible to analyze 
irradiation effects in detail, with irradiation dose and 
temperature as parameters, since the distribution of irradiation 
defects and impurities in depth can be identified. 
  Injected light element impurities, such as hydrogen 
isotopes, 
can be detected with a high degree of sensitivity based on the 
phenomena of resonant nuclear reaction, and nuclear elastic 
scattering using various ions from the medium-energy heavy ion 
irradiation device. As the energy of the injected heavy ions for 
detection is varied, their distribution according to the depth 
from the surface can be determined with a precision up to 100 
Angstroms. In the meantime, the Rutherford scattering phenomenon 
of [.sup]4[/]He from the medium-energy light ion irradiation 
device is used to analyze the injected heavy elements. By using 
it in conjunction with the ion channeling phenomenon, the type 
of irradiation defect, the distribution of the corresponding 
injected heavy element, and the crystal lattice occupation 
position can be obtained without destructive testing. 
  For examples of typical data obtained from these experiments 
in ion beam analysis, one can refer to the separate sheets. The 
results of such ion beam analysis experiments will form a 
quantitative and universal database needed for research in 
simulated irradiation testing by contrasting them with the 
results of direct observation by an electron microscope.

<H5>  Part VII (2) </H5>
  Materials testing usually involves an assessment of the 
particular properties of raw materials or materials (materials 
to constitute industrial products) that are part of products 
according to certain standards. At the same time, standards and 
testing methods are also necessary to assess the results of 
research on materials and mechanics, and to evaluate the 
reliability of products. Therefore, along with the expanding use 
of materials, and the progress of research, there is a growing 
number of material properties to be studied, which in turn leads 
to an increase in the number of measurement methods available, 
and progress in materials testing technology. 
  At JAERI, research and development is aimed at finding 
"practical applications for energy systems, including future 
energy generation systems based on nuclear reaction and the 
production of innovative nuclear fuels." As discussed earlier, 
the materials used for process heat reactors, or the nuclear 
fusion reactors under construction or development, may behave in 
unexpected ways since their operating conditions are an area in 
which we have no experience. Therefore, materials testing at 
JAERI is intended for the "development of a method to detect and 
evaluate unknown behaviors of materials" by introducing the 
results of research in more basic material development, coupled 
with behavior analysis, to meet the needs of such future 
reactors, in addition to the "established methods of materials 
testing." 
  As already noted, the objectives of research at JAERI 
include 
the development of (1) a high-temperature gas reactor, and (2) a 
nuclear fusion reactor. It is also engaged in safety research 
for the light water reactor. One of the major objectives of 
materials testing is to evaluate the reliability of the 
materials used in these reactors. Many of the materials covered 
are either structural materials or materials that require high 
levels of strength. The following are examples of experiments 
conducted to develop tests to measure the strength of various 
materials. 
<H3>  1. Development of Strength Testing Equipment for Irradiated 
Materials </H3>
  We will first introduce the instrumented Charpy testing 
device as an example of equipment designed to improve monitor 
testing, the high-temperature underwater tension testing device 
developed for research on irradiation-assisted stress corrosion 
cracking as an example of equipment designed for both 
engineering evaluation and basic research applications, and a 
post-irradiation materials testing device that uses micro test 
pieces as an example of a key technology development, as well as 
an operating technology development for the accelerator-type 
neutron source. 
<H3>  (1) Improvements in Monitor Testing Technology (Development 
of Instrumented Charpy Testing Device) </H3>
  Steel materials for the pressure vessels of light water 
reactors and high-temperature gas reactors are exposed to 
radiation by high-energy neutrons during operation, and suffer a 
reduction of their tenacity (reduction in rapture resistance). 
With the light water reactor, the tenacity of pressure vessel 
steel is estimated by monitor testing to judge whether or not 
the reduction of tenacity may lead to a nonductile rupture 
(instant brittle rapture). 
  Charpy testing is used for this purpose, and the judgment as 
to whether or not nonductile rupture will occur requires an 
estimate of the rapture tenacity value from the test results. In 
estimating the rapture tenacity value, the change in ductility 
brittleness transient temperature (DBTT) in test pieces is 
obtained from Charpy testing, and then the change of DBTT in the 
pressure vessel is estimated using the designated method. (The 
portion of concern in the pressure vessel is not the inner 
surface of the pressure vessel, but a place somewhat deeper in 
the vessel wall. The neutron dose is smaller, and its energy is 
lower here, considering the location of the monitor test 
pieces.) Next, reference values for the rapture tenacity value 
are obtained and form a calibration curve 
(RT[.sup]NDT[/]-K[.sub]IR[/] curve). 
  In this process, estimates are made for deviations in the 
DBTT change by the difference (in location) of the neutron 
environment between the pressure vessel and the monitor test 
piece, as well as the relationship between the DBTT change and 
the rapture tenacity value. It is believed that such estimates 
provide proper maintenance (on the safety side). A precise 
safety allowance evaluation and improved economy can be expected 
if small rapture tenacity test pieces can be collected directly 
from part of the pressure vessel material (as is being done in 
tests of Russian light water reactor annealing experiment) and 
measured directly to determine their rapture tenacity value. 
  It is well known that test pieces that are larger in size 
and 
faster in distortion speed (as in the case of an impulsive load) 
have a lower rapture tenacity value, since rapture tenacity 
values depend on the mechanical restrictions (size of test 
pieces), and the distortion speed. Rapture tenacity values used 
for rapture prevention evaluation for structures should 
approximate the minimum value. As for the size of test pieces, 
the size of Charpy test pieces is practical for use. Also, it is 
useful to be able to obtain rapture tenacity values from Charpy 
test pieces under the condition of an impulsive load. Although 
the problem of size effects remains in that case, there is a 
possibility of mitigating it by applying elastoplastic rapture 
mechanics. To this end, technological development aimed at 
implementing instrumented Charpy tests has been conducted. 
  The testing of irradiated materials introduced here is 
conducted in a hot cell in the hot laboratory facility. The hot 
cell is a room surrounded by radiation shielding walls. Normally 
it is equipped with an observation window for test operations, 
and a manipulator to replace manual operation. 
  Figure VII (2)-1 is a top view of part of JAERI's JMTR hot 
laboratory (see Figure VII (2)-7 for its cell structure). The 
numbered sections are hot cells, and the equipment listed in 
Table VII (2)-1 is installed in them. Charpy test equipment that 
can be used to monitor testing is installed in the hot cell 3, 
as well as in the hot test room at the Tokai Research 
Establishment. It is used mainly for round robin tests (to 
compare test methods and dose evaluation) for the IAEA, etc. The 
hammer used in these test machines has a structure to which a 
blade with a semiconductor distortion gauge can be installed, in 
addition to an ordinary blade. The position of the blade during 
testing can be measured by reading the rotation angle of the 
hammer electronically. Based on such devices, test loads and 
displacement during impulsive testing can be measured. This is a 
description of the instrumented Charpy test device.

  Figure VII (2)-3 illustrates the relationship between load 
and displacement. The test piece is made of 533B steel, which is 
used for a pressure vessel without irradiation. The test 
temperature is the room temperature. In instrumented Charpy 
tests, the resonance of the blade, the test piece, and the test 
machine appear to overlap with the load-displacement curve, and 
it tends to present a problem in that it is difficult to detect 
the conditions in which cracks occur. However, as long as the 
tenacity of the material remains within this range, resonance is 
not much of a problem. However, there are problems when a test 
piece with precracks induced by fatigue is tested below DBTT to 
obtain its rapture tenacity value. 



  When testing irradiated materials, the handling of materials 
is also a big problem. Charpy testing must be implemented at 
designated temperatures (between -100ÎC and 100ÎC). 
Cooling and heating is done in baths, but a test piece that is 
adjusted for the designated temperature may be affected 
adversely while being transported to the equipment. Therefore, 
placement and testing of the test piece must be conducted 
promptly. The test piece placement device shown in Figure VII 
(2)-4, which is operated remotely, has been added to solve this 
problem. Placement takes about four seconds using this device. 



<H3>  (2) Evaluation Equipment for Irradiation-Assisted Stress 
Corrosion Cracks (High-Temperature Underwater Distortion Speed 
Tension Testing Device) </H3>
  Even in an environment where corrosion is not severe, cracks 
may develop when a tension stress is applied to the material. 
This is largely due to a phenomenon called stress corrosion 
cracking. When the structure and element distribution are 
altered, the material's sensitivity to stress corrosion cracking 
sometimes increases. This is called "irradiation-assisted stress 
corrosion cracking (IASCC)." As already discussed, in an 
environment characterized by massive doses of high-energy 
neutrons, such as the primary wall of the nuclear fusion reactor 
blanket, the temperature rises above 200ÎC. Therefore, even 
with light water for the coolant, and austenitic stainless steel 
for the material, there is a high possibility that IASCC will 
occur and damage soundness if the water quality is not adequate. 
It is assumed that examination for IASCC may become necessary as 
the operational period (life time) of light water reactors is 
extended, even if the environment is not as severe as that in 
nuclear fusion reactors. 
  In order to evaluate sensitivity to IASCC in austenitic 
stainless steel in a high-temperature water environment, 
equipment for slow strain rate technique (SSRT) testing has been 
developed. 
  SSRT testing equipment is designed to conduct tension tests 
at a slow strain rate in a corrosive environment. When tension 
tests are conducted at a proper strain rate (generally below 1 x 
10[.sup]-6[/]/s for 304 steel in high-temperature water), the 
rapture speed and the restoration speed of the protective tissue 
(i.e., oxidation tissue) on the material surface enter a certain 
range, and corrosion begins selectively in the section that has 
a lower corrosion resistance due to the heterogeneity of the 
material. As a result, cracks may develop, showing a low 
ductility. SSRT testing is intended to evaluate the degree of 
sensitivity for stress corrosion cracking based on this 
phenomenon. 
  The newly developed equipment uses high-temperature water to 
create a corrosion environment. This is because priority is 
given to replicating the operational environment for austenitic 
stainless steel in light water reactors, and the projected water 
cooling environment for the nuclear fusion experimental reactor. 
The tension testing section of the equipment consists of a load 
adding device, and an autoclave (with an externally heated 
electric furnace) to provide the high-temperature high-pressure 
environment for test pieces. It is installed in the hot cell. 
The stress corrosion cracking phenomenon is highly sensitive to 
the corrosion potential of the test piece and water quality. 
Therefore, as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-5, electrodes to 
measure the corrosion potential are placed near the test piece 
in the autoclave to monitor the corrosion potential. The water 
loop, which has a water control function, is placed outside the 
hot cell. It supplies high-temperature high-pressure water with 
a controlled oxygen solution. The water loop consists of a water 
quality control section, a high-temperature high-pressure water 
circulation section, and a water quality measurement section. 
Figure VII (2)-6 illustrates the configuration of these systems. 






  This test equipment is installed in the JMTR hot laboratory. 
The specifications of the equipment are presented in Table VII 
(2)-3. The equipment can replicate the PWR environment by 
selecting the highest temperature of 300ÎC. Although the 
operational conditions for the austenitic stainless steel used 
for the primary wall of the nuclear fusion reactor blanket have 
yet to be determined, it does not prevent us from simulating 
this environment as the temperature of the coolant will be about 
100ÎC, and will correspond to PWR conditions. The oxygen 
solution is controlled within a range of 0.01-32 ppm, which 
corresponds to a range where the lower bound is smaller than the 
actual value for the primary coolant for a BWR, to the peak 
value for a saturated oxygen solution.

  Figure VII (2)-7 illustrates the locations of the tension 
test section and the control equipment inside and outside the 
hot cell. Figure VII (2)-8 is a photograph of the interior of 
the cell, including the autoclave, with a view of the hot cell. 
The following considerations have been made in designing and 
producing the SSRT test equipment for irradiated test pieces: 
  (i) Remote-control operability, including manipulator 
operation. 
  (ii) Restriction in size to permit installation in the hot 
cell. 
  (iii) Ability to remove contamination by restricting the 
range of contamination from radioactive materials. 






  For instance, in the tension testing equipment, reliability 
of the load adding device is secured, and the effects of 
external disturbances, such as temperature change, are 
minimized. Furthermore, the autoclave container has a desorption 
device, as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-9, to be operated only 
with the manipulator, and a bi-tongue rubber seal is cooled to 
improve its durability. In such testing, there is a high 
possibility that the high-temperature water loop will be 
contaminated with corrosion products that remain on the surface 
of the test piece, or from the test piece itself. Therefore, it 
is necessary to confine contamination by radioactive materials 
to the area around the autoclave only. To achieve this, filters 
made of sintered metals are used for the exit of the autoclave, 
etc., and it is structured to allow an easy exchange of filters. 
With regard to fixing test pieces, electric insulation is 
necessary to measure the corrosion potential of the test pieces 
during SSRT testing. Also, the operability of the manipulator 
must be considered. Thus zirconium spacers processed with 
surface oxidation are used. 



  The following is an example of the results achieved using 
this equipment. The goal is to determine those operating 
conditions where stress corrosion cracking sensitivity by 
irradiation damage can increase. A test piece of 316 stainless 
steel was irradiated at 300ÎC and 400ÎC with sling 
damage at about 8 dpa at the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR). 
  Figure VII (2)-10 illustrates the load-displacement curves 
obtained in SSRT testing. While the irradiated test piece 
(EL-14) displayed about a 10 percent extension after the tension 
test in a vacuum, the degree of extension in the test piece 
(GFC-15) was reduced (to less than 4 percent of plastic 
extension) in the SSRT test (at a tension speed of 1.8 x 
10[.sup]-4[/] mm/min). The curve for a test piece (EL-31) 
without irradiation is also indicated in the diagram. The 
fractured surface of the irradiated test piece (GFC-15) tested 
in high-temperature water is an intergranular fractured surface, 
as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-11, and this verifies that 
fracture is caused by stress corrosion cracking. 






  Development of equipment for SSRT and EPR testing is not 
sufficient for research on IASCC. In addition, equipment for the 
evaluation of element distribution, such as an analytical 
transmission electron microscope, and equipment to extract test 
pieces from the component materials of operating machines (the 
electric discharge machine for micro test pieces to be 
introduced later) have been developed. Furthermore, development 
of the constant load test machine to measure stress corrosion 
cracking, and the test equipment for stress corrosion cracking 
to be used in reactors has been considered. 
<H3>  (3) Evaluation of Strength of Irradiated Materials Based on 
Micro Test Pieces </H3>
  The size of micro test pieces used for material strength 
evaluation is between 0.1 and several millimeters, which is far 
smaller than the test pieces used for conventional strength 
evaluations. In general, strength properties correspond to the 
size of test pieces. Therefore, it is often not advantageous to 
use test pieces whose size is far smaller than the real parts of 
the structure in question. In reality, of course, smaller test 
pieces are generally used for economic reasons. Therefore, 
standard testing methods are designed (including the size of 
test pieces) to eliminate the problems deriving from the 
reduction of size. 
  The size of the micro test pieces used for material strength 
evaluation is rather small, considering the scale of the parts 
of the structure. In spite of the problems caused by such a gap, 
far smaller test pieces are used for the following reasons: 
  (i) They are essential if an accelerator-type neutron source 
is to be used. 
  (ii) The amount of radiation is restricted, even with 
nuclear 
fission reactor irradiation. 
  (iii) The sizes of parts used in the equipment in question 
have become smaller. 
  Points (i) and (ii) are requirements for nuclear fusion 
reactor materials development. As described in the previous 
chapter, an accelerator-type neutron source is proposed as the 
radiation source for material testing because it can approximate 
the conditions of a neutron environment, and the amount of 
radiation there is extremely small. Furthermore, practically the 
only irradiation equipment that can be used for the development 
of nuclear fusion reactor materials is the high flux isotope 
reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The 
maximum volume that can be irradiated there is only 100 cc, and 
thus the reduction of the size of test pieces is significant. 
  The item (iii) has reference to the fact that minimum 
measurements, such as the thickness of the parts to be used in a 
fusion reactor is only several millimeters, and thus they are 
often small parts rather than large structures, such as pressure 
vessels. Furthermore, as the size of the equipment used in the 
newer light water reactors (such as ABWR and APWR) has become 
smaller, it is necessary to pay attention to new kinds of damage 
that may be different from conventional types. Unlike (i) and 
(ii), this is an extension of the thought that testing is to be 
conducted in conditions that approximate the conditions of the 
real machine materials. In seeking to extend the life time of 
light water reactors, data on the material strength derived from 
parts of the real structure may contribute to improving 
evaluation accuracy. Then, (iii) will respond to such a need. 
Before a piece of equipment, and the materials that compose it, 
can be put to use under severe conditions, it is necessary to 
gather a body of data on a variety of items concerning 
measurements of materials and the causes of damage. Also, there 
may be cases that are difficult to deal with within the range of 
conventional test methods. For instance, it is difficult to 
evaluate the fracture toughness of materials used for thin wall 
equipment when using a test method based on linear fracture 
mechanics. Reducing the size of test pieces will also contribute 
to a reduction of radioactive materials. 
  The use of small test pieces and micro test pieces in 
irradiation tests to evaluate the strength of materials creates 
problems in terms of measurement effects on test pieces, as well 
as the handling of test pieces (which may be too small for the 
manipulator). Measurement effects can be dealt with as follows: 
[1] to discover the range with smaller effects, [2] to formulate 
the measurement effects, and [3] to obtain only relative 
relationships within the same testing. Also, the test method is 
designed to reduce measurement effects. 
  With regard to elastic and plastic properties, materials and 
test piece measurements often fit into case [1]. However, as 
this is difficult to determine logically, for the time being 
judgments must be made on the basis of comparisons with the 
state of distortion in individual cases, and results from tests 
using relatively large pieces. Irradiation often results in a 
stiffening of the materials. This is due to the generation of a 
number of groups of micro defects (on the order of 1 Êm or 
less) by irradiation. The generation of such groups of micro 
defects tends to reduce measurement effects as far as plastic 
behavior is concerned. In contrast, rapture properties affect 
measurement effects, and these can be realistically treated with 
[2] and [3]. Concerning fatigue behavior, there are some results 
that indicate that certain conditions will reduce measurement 
effects (although the formation effects are larger in some 
cases). Handling technology has been developed by producing 
remote control equipment. 
  The following is a description of the equipment that has 
been 
developed. For testing equipment, we will describe equipment for 
small punch testing and tension testing, as well as test 
equipment to obtain DBTT by trimming. Because handling 
technology for test pieces is important, test piece handling 
equipment and test piece processing equipment will be 
introduced. As test pieces or a test piece material, test pieces 
for the transmission electron microscope (TEM test piece: 
3Ì x 
0.25 mmt) are used. The reason for this selection is that, in 
spite of the difference with the original purpose, the TEM test 
piece is a small test piece that is irradiated by set standards, 
and offers a number of advantages in obtaining the relationship 
between micro structures and intensity properties. 
  In the meantime, a comprehensive report on technology in the 
nuclear field entitled "Evaluation of Strength of Micro Test 
Piece Materials" has been published by the Atomic Energy Society 
of Japan, and the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). 
  [1] Strength Test Equipment for Micro Test Piece 
  The strength test equipment for micro test pieces is 
designed 
to conduct small punch (SP) testing, as illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-12 (together with the test piece holder) and tension 
(small-scale tension) testing for micro test pieces. 



  First, we will describe SP testing. This is a type of 
bulging 
test in which the test piece is deformed while it is in a state 
of two-spindle tension. Therefore, multiple-spindle stress can 
be increased (distortion bind becomes larger) compared to 
tension testing, and a reduction of the measurement effects can 
be expected. Therefore, it is said that property values 
corresponding to the fracture toughness value can be obtained 
from relatively small pieces. This method has been applied at 
the Ames Research Laboratory in the United States, Tohoku 
University, and JAERI. 
  In SP testing, the relationship of deflection between load 
and the test pieces is obtained as illustrated in Figure VII 
(2)-13. This relationship of deflection consists of four 
distortion steps. These are the elastic distortion stage, the 
plastic distortion stage, the plastic film extension stage, and 
the plastic instability stage, in the order of less distortion. 
In the plastic instability stage, the load increase for the 
distortion is reduced, and the load is reduced sharply when 
rapture finally occurs in part of the test piece. Concerning 
material properties, stress at yield of the material can be 
estimated from the conditions of transition from the elastic 
distortion stage to the plastic bending stage, and the fracture 
toughness value can be estimated from the energy spent for 
distortion until rapture occurs (corresponding to the area 
confined by the load-distortion curve or SP energy) or the 
drawing value of the rapture section (to be measured after 
testing). Figure VII (2)-14 illustrates the relationship between 
the SP energy obtained from the same material, and the Jc value 
obtained in the standard fracture toughness test. Because 
materials that present brashiness ductility transition for 
temperature also present transition of SP energy, the brashiness 
ductility transition temperature of the material, usually 
measured by Charpy test, can be estimated from this transition 
temperature (SPDBTT). 






  Except for the size of the test pieces, tension testing for 
micro test pieces is not radically different from ordinary 
tension testing. The shape of these test pieces is illustrated 
in Figure VII (2)-15. However, when the material is hardened by 
irradiation, uniform extension often may not be observed. 
Evaluation of such materials requires drawing values. Drawing 
tends to become smaller when the thickness of the test piece is 
less than its width (when w/t is large) as illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-16. As change is not significant when the w/t value is 
within 2, the width of the test piece is less than twice the 
thickness. The cross-section of the test piece is smallest near 
the center. This is done to eliminate the effects of stress 
concentrated on the holding section, and to generate rapture 
near the center of the test piece. Measurement effects appear to 
be small in 316 austenite stainless steel, as long as crystal 
grains are not particularly large. The results of tension tests 
using a standard piece and a micro test piece are shown in Table 
VII (2)-4.

  The test piece is attached to the holder illustrated in 
Figure VII (2)-12. The holder in the diagram is one for SP 
testing, and a similar holder is used for holding the test piece 
for tension testing. Attachment of test pieces to the holder is 
implemented by the micro manipulator, which will be introduced 
later. The holder with the test piece is mounted on the 
turntable in the chamber by the ordinary manipulator. Figure VII 
(2)-17 is a view of the test machine (installed in the hot cell) 
and the inside of the chamber. The turntable is a disk with 
holes, on which 12 holders can be mounted. Figure VII (2)-18 is 
a diagram showing a cross-section of the chamber. After mounting 
holders on the turntable, the turntable is rotated to place one 
of the holders directly under the electric furnace (arrow 1 in 
Figure VII (2)-18). Next, the lower rod moves the holder upward 
(arrow 2), and presses to fix the holder to the upper rod. Then, 
the actuator rod is lowered to conduct testing (arrow 3). When 
testing is completed, the lower rod moves down, and returns the 
holder to the turntable (arrow 4). The test is conducted by 
repeating this process. This sequence of actions is controlled 
by a personal computer so that testing can be implemented 
automatically or semiautomatically. 






  The specifications for the testing machine are listed in 
Table VII (2)-5. The measurement of test piece displacement, 
such as deflection of SP test pieces, can affect distortion of 
the testing mechanism by the test load. To reduce such effects, 
the stiffness of the test machine is increased (using the frame, 
which has a capacity for three tons). In addition, the rod for 
displacement measurement with the differential transformer core 
at the end is placed in the lower rod (pipe), and displacement 
is measured by pressing the lower rod to the lower face of the 
test piece (in the case of SP testing). The differential 
transformer is placed outside the chamber to shield it from the 
effects of radiation and temperature.

  [2] High-Speed Punch Test Machine 
  DBTT obtained from TEM test material by SP testing is 
radically lower than DBTT obtained by the standard Charpy test. 
Although it is considered possible to implement conversion based 
on a relative evaluation and the interrelationship of two tests, 
cooling the test material to a low temperature (the temperature 
of liquid nitrogen in the case of nonirradiated 2.25 Cr 1 Mo 
steel) for DBTT measurement may generate a problem in terms of 
testing efficiency. An increase in distortion speed, and a 
concentration of stress increase the DBTT value. High-speed 
punch testing is intended to increase DBTT by applying a 
punching distortion with a high distortion speed to the test 
piece which has a notch for stress concentration. 
  Figure VII (2)-19 is an illustration of the test piece, and 
the punch test method. The test piece has a notch formed into 
concentric circles. Since shear distortion by punching occurs in 
an area of the test piece where stress is concentrated, a 
relatively high distortion speed can be applied in testing 
conducted at the same displacement speed. To obtain a sufficient 
distortion speed, the test piece is punched with a maximum 
displacement speed of 1 m/s. Absorption energy is obtained from 
the relationship between the load and displacement at the time 
of testing. The load is measured by the load cell using a high 
resonant frequency. At present, displacement is obtained from 
the relationship between average speed and time. 



  Figure VII (2)-20 illustrates the relationship between 
absorption energy and temperature obtained by the standard 
Charpy test, the SP test, and the high-speed punch test for test 
materials made of two types of tempered martensitic steel (HT9 
and 8 Cr 2 WTa steel). When DBTT is set in the center of the 
transition temperature range (the method of determining DBTT for 
this test is under examination), then the temperature of this 
test method is higher than that of the SP test. However, there 
was almost no difference in temperature between the two types of 
materials in this test method, although there was a difference 
of about 80ÎC in the standard Charpy test. This probably is 
due to a small difference between the size of the plastic region 
at the tip of cracks, and a small mechanical restriction in the 
growth process of cracks. In other words, it is judged that the 
difference was reduced because of the measurement effects. This 
suggests that it is difficult in general to overcome measurement 
effects when testing test pieces to determine material 
properties related to rapture. Therefore, this test is limited 
to relative evaluations. 



  The mechanism of this device is not much different from that 
of the strength test equipment for micro test pieces shown in 
Figure VII (2)-17. The use of a linearly moving test piece 
holder instead of a rotary one, and a reduction in the size of 
the chamber are the main differences. Otherwise, there are no 
fundamental differences, including clamping of test pieces with 
the upper and the lower rods. The specifications for the test 
equipment are presented in Table VII (2)-6.

  [3] Micro Manipulator and Electric Discharge Machine for 
Micro Test Pieces 
  Practical testing of irradiated materials using micro test 
pieces requires mounting, inspecting, processing, and disposing 
of test pieces by remote control. Based on the "Micro Test Piece 
Materials Testing Technology" project of JAERI, a micro 
manipulator used to mount and inspect test pieces, and an 
electric discharge machine to produce micro pieces for tension 
testing, and small Charpy testing have been developed. 
  In the process of "treating test pieces" in mounting test 
pieces on equipment and jibs, it often becomes necessary to pick 
up a randomly placed test piece, and to transport it to a 
designed location. The micro manipulator illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-21 was developed as a device to effect supplementary 
control by a personal computer for such operations. The 
following is an example of a process for handling test pieces 
using this equipment. Using an ordinary manipulator, test pieces 
are picked up from the container and placed randomly on the test 
piece plate (in the lower left corner of Figure VII (2)-21) of 
the micro manipulator. Next, the image of the test pieces is 
captured by a video camera located above the test piece plate, 
and numerical data (coordinates) on the locations of individual 
test pieces are obtained. The coordinates are transmitted to the 
XYZ arm, which is equipped with vacuum tweezers. The arm then 
picks up the test piece, and mounts it on the designated jig. 
The equipment includes a rotating stage to reverse test pieces, 
and to obtain transmission X-ray images of test pieces. In 
addition, a nondestructive program to measure the thickness 
distribution of test pieces from the X-ray images made after SP 
testing by the CT method has been developed. 



  Figure VII (2)-22 illustrates the electric discharge machine 
for micro test pieces. The reason for selecting electric 
discharge for processing micro test pieces is that remote 
control can be done easily, and relatively precise processing 
can be implemented on various materials since machining is 
controlled electronically or electrically. The equipment is 
based on XY control of the test piece stage, and on three-axis 
NC control of the processing axis (actuator). The test piece is 
mounted on the processing holder by the micro manipulator, and 
is processed. As the electrode for processing suffers wear 
during processing, it is necessary to prevent such wear without 
sacrificing processing precision to improve operability. One 
measure designed to achieve improvement involves the creation of 
a circuit to generate arc prevention potential in the processing 
power source. 



<H5>  3. Future Development of Materials Testing </H5>
  From the standpoint of developing new types of reactors, the 
major purpose of materials testing is to simulate materials 
performance to evaluate the reliability of plants. Effective 
simulation requires an analysis of the damaging mechanism of 
structures and materials, which in turn depends on basic 
materials research, including designating test items and 
measuring methods. The operational conditions for structural 
materials for new types of reactors, in particular, are affected 
by unprecedented "damage due to compound mechanisms." Such 
mechanisms include high-energy neutrons, high temperature, 
corrosion, stress, and vibration. Therefore, unless the behavior 
of materials is fully assessed by basic research and 
experiments, evaluating the reliability of plants could prove to 
be difficult. Furthermore, as plants are required to have a high 
level of reliability, a basic examination is necessary even for 
items, among compound operations, that are normally free from 
interaction and thus seem less problematic. Therefore, it will 
become necessary to devise ad hoc evaluation tests on various 
items. The following presents some perspectives on the 
development of materials testing in the future, taking as an 
example the development of structural materials for nuclear 
fusion reactors. 
  The materials used to blanket nuclear fusion reactors are 
exposed to intense irradiation (30 dpa at the experimental 
reactor and over 100 dpa at the demonstration reactor) by 
high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. In addition, they also receive 
chemical effects from light water and liquid metals, which are 
used as coolants, in an environment characterized by high 
temperatures (over 500ÎC for liquid metal cooling, such as a 
PWR condition for light water cooling) and varying stresses. 
Neutron radiation causes irradiation hardening, helium 
brittleness, irradiation-assisted segregation, and void 
swelling. Such changes and other factors -- such as temperature, 
chemical environment, and changes in stress -- work together to 
damage materials in complex ways, such as irradiation corrosion 
cracking. 
  The mechanism behind such complex damage is not simply a 
cumulative operation of various damage mechanisms. For instance, 
hardening by irradiation not only reduces tenacity, but also 
alters the fatigue mechanism, and sometimes helps generate 
fatigue cracking. If such cracking reaches the stage where 
irradiation-assisted segregation causes corrosion resistance to 
deteriorate, the development of cracks can be accelerated by the 
effects of the chemical environment. Also, the introduction of 
plastic deformation by fatigue may alter creep deformation and 
void swelling behavior later on. Therefore, in order to evaluate 
the reliability of materials to be used in a nuclear fusion 
reactor, it is necessary to designate testing methods and items 
by evaluating such compound effects, and by determining whether 
or not compound effects become important. In some cases, actual 
irradiation testing may be necessary. In an effort to deal with 
this problem, the following items for evaluation have been 
examined: 
  [1] Strength Properties in Corrosion Environment (Corrosion 
Fatigue and Stress Corrosion Cracking) 
  Fatigue testing of materials is conducted after neutron 
irradiation in an environment where light water or liquid metals 
are used. In the case of a light water environment, gamma rays 
are applied during testing to adjust the effects of radicals in 
the irradiation environment. As there may be creep effects 
during irradiation (of materials and oxidation tissue), simple 
examination of behavior during irradiation by means of ion 
irradiation may be considered. 
  [2] Creep Fatigue During Irradiation 
  As fatigue load is thought to occur primarily when plasma is 
generated, it is relatively rare for fatigue distortion to occur 
during irradiation. Acceleration of creep by plastic distortion 
is evaluated by alternating creep during irradiation and 
distortion (extracted from the irradiation capsule, and 
irradiated again after applying some plastic distortion as 
post-irradiation testing). 
  [3] Evaluation of Behavior During Abnormal Operation 
  Disruption (decay) of plasma is expected to expose part of 
the primary wall to high temperatures close to the fusing point. 
The effects of change in the texture caused by such a rise in 
temperature on swelling and helium brittleness are evaluated. 
  [4] Texture and Analytical Testing by Transmission Electron 
Microscope 
  Evaluation of damaged texture by the transmission electron 
microscope (TEM), and evaluation of segregation due to 
irradiation damage by micro region element analysis are 
conducted. 
  In addition, of course, other tests such as tension testing, 
fatigue testing, elastic plastic fracture toughness testing, 
fatigue cracking growth testing, irradiation creep testing, and 
permeation density testing (measuring the amount of swelling) 
are conducted. JAERI is engaged in cooperative research on the 
development of nuclear fusion reactor materials with ORNL, where 
some of the above tests are conducted. The facilities for tests 
[1] through [4] will be made available to ORNL. 
  Although [4] above is not included in the conventional range 
of materials testing, it will become important when considering 
the characteristics of material damage in the nuclear fusion 
reactor environment without irradiation equipment at present 
beginning with the stage of texture change in simulated 
irradiation (spectrum adjusted irradiation and ion irradiation). 
It can also be pointed out that irradiation-assisted segregation 
evaluation capability, which is a material behavior control 
factor in the environment for irradiation corrosion, has reached 
a practical level through enhancement of element analysis 
capability (about 2mm of location resolution). For these 
reasons, there is a need to develop specialized equipment. 
  In some cases, irradiated TEM test materials can radiate 
gamma rays at about 200 mSv in air. Therefore, it is essential 
to develop remote control equipment to produce test materials 
(by electrolytic brightening) for the electron microscope. (It 
is necessary to reduce activated sections of the test materials 
to the micro gram order.) 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  As mentioned at the beginning, the conditions under which 
materials will be used in new types of reactors are new and 
severe. Therefore, materials may display patterns of behavior 
that are rarely seen in the current environment. The evaluation 
of new items is a required part of materials testing. It is 
supported by evaluation technology (as exemplified by the 
analytical electron microscope and micro test piece material 
evaluation technology), and by the analysis of material behavior 
in complex environments by basic research (as exemplified by 
irradiation-assisted segregation research). Knowledge and 
technology obtained in this way should help expand the range of 
applications in various fields in addition to the nuclear field.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah Abar: "Pasqua at El Ayoun Asked Saudis and </F>
Moroccans To Quit Aiding Islamists"] 
  [Text] LE POINT, the French weekly, reports this week that 
[French Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua has asked Saudi and 
Moroccan authorities to "curb" the Islamists. 
  In exchange, Paris would promise financial aid to Algeria. 
This was the burden of talks held about a week ago in El Aaiun, 
capital of Western Sahara, between the French interior minister 
and his Saudi counterpart, Emir Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz Al-Sa'ud. 
Observers said the French initiative springs from the new 
strategy adopted just three months ago in Paris, following 
approaches from Algerian and Tunisian authorities. 
  [Tunisian] President Ben Ali reportedly has convinced the 
French to take steps to protect the Maghrebian zone from 
"Islamist turbulence." France is now convinced collapse of the 
Algerian regime would ineluctably drag the rest of the 
Maghreb--along with other Arab countries such as Egypt, Jordan, 
and Yemen--down the dangerous road to Islamism. 
  Also, according to reliable sources, a report prepared by 
French intelligence (DGSE [General Directorate for External 
Security]) supports Quai d'Orsay's assessment that France would 
undoubtedly become a battleground for rivalries between Arab 
modernists and Islamists, should Algerian fundamentalists come 
to power in Algeria. 
  France has a Muslim population of more than 4.5 million. 
This 
daunting prospect was responsible for steps taken by French 
authorities to defuse any possibility of an explosion in the 
Maghreb. 
  Place Beauvau (headquarters of the Interior Ministry) is 
convinced Algeria has two overriding needs: first, severance of 
the supply lines providing arms and money to the armed Islamist 
groups; %second, financial aid to revive its economy and 
alleviate popular discontent. 
  Paris believes the Saudis and Moroccans have a role to play 
on both fronts. 
  According to LE POINT, Pasqua spoke with Emir Nayif about 
the need for Franco-Saudi cooperation in the struggle against 
the Islamists, and in particular about the aid some Saudi 
princes continue providing to the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. 
Pasqua asked for an immediate halt to such aid. 
  The same message was delivered to the Moroccans, it has been 
learned. 
  FIS leaders have stated that "Afghans" forced to leave 
Pakistan have transited Moroccan territory on their way back to 
rejoin Islamist terrorist cells in Algeria. Everyone knows 
Moroccan authorities have quietly tolerated these Islamist 
"infiltrations," despite Rabat's decision last year to remand 
into Algerian custody Abdelhak Layada, a high-ranking leader of 
the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] arrested in Oujda. 
  According to LE POINT, Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam even 
approached Morocco with a proposal to recognize the 
"Moroccanness" of the Sahara to prevent establishment of 
[Islamist] staging bases on the kingdom's territory. 
  Pasqua has also initiated contacts to convince Iranian 
leaders to stop meddling in the affairs of the Maghrebian 
countries. The new French strategy was behind the decision to 
release two Iranian terrorists who were supposed to be turned 
over to Swiss authorities.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 29 January 
publishes on page 16 an approximately 3,500-word article by 
Islamic scholar Dr. Mustafa Mahmud in which he attacks 
secularists in Egypt as "enemies of religion" and "trumpets of a 
foreign cultural invasion" of the country. 
  The writer maintains that the secularists' chief concern is 
"to confront religion and slander Islamists." The secularists, 
he says, "view terrorists and Islamists of all schools of 
thought as one and the same thing. Categorizing them into 
moderate Islamists, extremist Islamists, and criminal 
terrorists, secularists say, is merely a distribution of roles 
within the same trend, a backward and metaphysical trend hostile 
to civilization." 
  Acknowledging anyone's right to choose his own thinking and 
ideology, the writer contends that no one should go beyond this 
freedom to attack religion and those who believe in it. "Those 
in our country who adopt secularism as their ideology are free 
to do so. If they use the sword of authority or the weapon of 
the media to confront the other side, they will be dragging the 
country to catastrophe. But they will achieve nothing. No 
force, no matter how strong, can sow this bad seed in Egypt's 
soil. Egypt can never suit the growth of this kind of thought; 
it is the land of faith, religion, and prophets." 
  Commenting on the current debate on religion and secularism, 
Mahmud says: "I don't think such debate could have started if 
the stage had not been carefully prepared for it by the horrible 
introduction of the so-called Islamic terrorism." The writer 
adds sarcastically: "And because there is Islamic terrorism, 
the secularist assembly must take the lead and rush to defend 
our society, which is threatened with destruction." 
  The writer then cites a CNN report on CIA financial support 
for Golboddin Hekmatyar, "who runs training camps for over 
10,000 terrorists in Afghanistan," concluding that "Islamic 
terrorism, which suddenly appeared on the scene to upset 
balances in the region, is a creation, premeditated sedition." 
He explains: "After the Islamists triumphed in Afghanistan, it 
became a pressing American interest to divide their ranks and 
create conflict among them to deprive them of the fruits of 
victory and, more importantly, to turn Islamic rule into a 
massacre so that no one would be tempted to establish such 
rule." He adds: "If Hekmatyar is opening scores of camps to 
train over 10,000 terrorists and then send them to particular 
Arab countries for sabotage, this is his second mission. Through 
its agents in Pakistan or any other agent Arab country, the CIA 
will provide him with the millions he needs." 
  The writer states: "If they are sabotaging Egypt and 
distorting its Islam so that it has no Islamic rule, then they 
are mistaken. With the diversified composition of its people and 
its position amid storms, Egypt will not choose `a professional 
Islamist' to rule it. It will always prefer a civilian 
government that respects Islam and preserves its traditions and 
respects Christianity and preserves its values. No Egyptian 
Islamist thinker plans to rule. The Islamists' greatest 
ambition is to create an enlightened and influential Islamic 
public to preserve religion's values and role in the social 
arena." 
  "If they realized this," the writer adds, "they would feel 
at 
ease and let others rest; they would save those squandered 
millions. But, most likely, they have a far-reaching objective: 
Shaking the Islamic creed, breaking its backbone, and removing 
it from hearts. But they, and all the money in the world, can 
never achieve this."

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Ibrahim Dasuqi Abazah] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Husni Mubarak is very much interested 
in stability, and has been keen to call on the national forces 
to defend stability. His Excellency underlined this call in his 
recent speech at the Police Academy and described at length the 
dangers facing the country as a result of instability. 
  We do not disagree with the president about the need for 
stability, and reject any attempt to undermine it. But we fully 
disagree with the president when he says that terrorism is the 
only cause of instability and that ending it will lead to 
stability. This is a simplification of the problem. It 
disregards the real reasons for and deep roots of the problem. 
  The real reason for instability is not terrorism, but the 
ruling dictatorship that created terrorism. The bullets were 
not fired from a vacuum, but due to a painful reality produced 
by the dictatorship and its bad policies and abnormal actions. 
Had there been a flourishing economy, social justice, and 
equality before the law, no crisis would have developed, 
suffering would not have increased, and corruption would not 
have spread. All these factors created the atmosphere which led 
to violence and the spread of terrorism. They established 
terrorism as the basis for the bloody way of dealing with the 
ruling authority. 
  Terrorism, if the president would like to know, is not the 
direct reason for instability, but the natural outcome of the 
regime's dictatorship. Why confuse cause and effect? 
  Is the purpose of this confusion to prompt the political 
parties to stand behind the president against terrorism? 
  If this was the purpose, it will only achieve something that 
already exists, because the parties reject terrorism and have 
often announced this rejection on every occasion. What more 
does the president expect from them? 
  Does he expect them to go down on the streets to fight the 
terrorists? Or does he expect them to find work for every 
unemployed person? There is a home for every naked person; 
there is treatment for every sick person; and there is a 
punishment for every criminal. 
  The opposition can do nothing more than reject terrorism and 
alert people to its dangers. It will not be able to contain or 
end terrorism, whatever means it may have, as long as the reason 
for the problem continues to exist. What is the purpose of this 
repeated call to defend stability? Why do they deliberately 
disregard the factors that threaten stability? 
  Any observer of the regime's actions on ordeals and crises 
can only conclude that the purpose and goal of the call for a 
dialogue is to achieve stability for the regime itself, and not 
to achieve stability, security, and peace for Egypt--unless we 
maintain that the ruling regime is a democratic one that depends 
on the popular will and heeds it. In such a case, the regime's 
stability or instability would be considered Egypt's stability 
or instability. But the reality is that there is an organic 
separation between the ruling regime and the broad popular base. 
The regime is in one valley and the people in another. Any 
attempt to link the regime with the popular base is bound to 
fail because the interests of the masses and their daily 
sufferings are not taken into consideration by the regime, 
except in its propaganda. 
  The only solution is for the regime to admit that there is 
something wrong and start correcting it. This, in short, means 
recognizing the need for political reform and accepting the need 
for direct talks with the national forces about the steps to 
move toward democracy, and about the substance, measures, and 
timetable for this transformation. This transformation is the 
natural prelude to the achievement of the desired economic and 
social reforms. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "After Years-Long Recession, Peace </F>
Plan Expectations Raise Temperature of Jordanian Construction 
Sector"] 
  [Text] Signs of energy have surfaced in the Jordanian real 
estate and construction market, where varied transactions have 
been concluded in various parts of West Amman. This is a sign to 
which investors attach great expectations, hoping that it will 
lead the market out of the stagnation it has been experiencing 
for several months. 
  AL-MAJALLAH has become certain that a number of transactions 
were concluded in recent weeks as a result of a 5-10 percent 
drop in land prices and a 20-25 percent drop in apartment 
prices, whereas investment real estate has maintained its high 
levels. 
  Arab and foreign firms owned by Jordanians led the market 
activity in a step which has been characterized by observers as 
being within the framework of preparation for the post-peace 
era, which has entered the countdown phase. 
  High-level economic sources expect great growth in the 
Jordanian building and construction sector in the foreseeable 
future. They expect this sector's contribution to the domestic 
product to exceed the figures recorded in 1992, amounting to 99 
percent [as published], and to the added value, amounting to 164 
million dinars [JD] ($237.8 million). This sector is 
characterized by the fact that it is interlocked with the other 
sectors. Nearly 15 percent of the gross domestic product is 
attributed to this sector. 
  This real estate market activity coincides with the imminent 
implementation of the Jordanian five-year plan projects. This 
plan's investment program abounds with a large number of 
infrastructure construction projects. Construction sector 
experts assert that the volume of credit facilities provided by 
Jordanian banking apparatus units from the beginning of the year 
to the end of last August amounted to JD572 million, amounting 
to 21 percent and ranking second behind the commercial sector. 
  Engineer Muhammad Ibrahim, a Jordanian real estate officer, 
believes that the banks' demands of real estate investors 
compelled the latter to reduce their prices in order to fulfill 
their bank obligations. The market responded promptly to this 
reduction, which amounted to nearly 20 percent in some cases, 
thus devouring investors' profits. 
  Engineer Ibrahim expects that the building and construction 
sector's performance will improve with the inauguration of the 
economic activities of the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which 
will extend to the other sectors because of the link between the 
Palestinian and Jordanian economies. 
  Engineer Muhammad Khayr Zayd al-Kaylani, a real estate 
investor and chairman of the Housing Real Estate Investors 
Association, does not agree with Engineer Ibrahim regarding the 
reduced prices' impact on the market. But al-Kaylani did agree 
that the market has been experiencing severe stagnation since 
last September because of political reasons, coupled with lack 
of clarity in the Jordanian economy's future trends and the 
state of anticipation and caution prevailing in the various 
sectors of the Jordanian economy. 
  Al-Kaylani agrees that the market suffers from a surplus in 
housing apartments, noting that this surplus started to 
accumulate in the second half of this year. He added that 2.7 
million square meters were licensed in 1990. The figure rose to 
4.37 million square meters in 1991 and 6.5 millions square 
meters in 1992 as a result of the leap in demand for housing and 
land in wake of the return of 350,000 expatriates from Kuwait. 
Al-Kaylani added that the picture has changed this year, with 
the licensed area amounting in the first half of this year to 
1.65 square million meters. The figure is expected to amount to 
3 million square meters by the end of the year. 
  Fawwaz Mahmud, the head of a business group, denied that 
there is a big surplus in housing apartments in the Jordanian 
real estate market. He asserted that the international apartment 
vacancy rate ranges from 7-10 percent to meet demand for 
relocation, seasonal tourism, citizens' needs to change their 
housing, and other reasons. Mahmud expects apartment prices to 
hold up, supporting his opinion with the statement that most of 
the building and construction industry raw material is imported 
from abroad and not subject to local market activity. He added 
that selling apartments at reduced prices means saddling real 
estate investors with losses. 
  On his part, Isma'il 'Amr, director of the Amman 
International Real Estate Firm, expects the real estate market 
to move later, perhaps in 1995, because the market has 
experienced unprecedented construction activity and real estate 
investments amounted to JD1.5 billion ($2.2 billion). He added 
that this activity was not planned activity and that the fifth 
private sector took the initiative in this activity. Excess 
local liquidity, large and unstable demand for housing real 
estate, and limited investment opportunities in the Jordanian 
market added momentum to the construction activity. 
  In the past 30 years the real estate market has experienced 
fluctuations, strangulations, and demand periods, spurred mainly 
by compulsory evacuations, political events witnessed by the 
region since 1967, the Lebanese war and the Kuwait war of 
liberation, and finally, the peace process and the Gaza-Jericho 
accord and the results they are expected to produce.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The weekly AL-SHALL economic report criticized the 
government's report concerning the economic situation in the 
country and the government's inability to give accurate 
statistics in good time. The report's text follows: 
<H5>  Government's Report Concerning the Economic Situation </H5>
  The government has submitted a report to the National 
Assembly concerning economic conditions in the country, 
describing developments of the situation with regard to public 
finance, the oil sector, directions and changes of monetary 
policy, the foreign trade sector, and the securities market. The 
report went into structural problems that the Kuwaiti economy 
faces and proposals to counter those issues, even though they 
are within desirable limits in many of their directions. There 
was tangible progress in the report, compared with previous 
reports and statements by the government, in which there was 
wariness concerning political reactions and a desire not to 
publish recent or clearly defined numbers. 
  The government based its expectations for general revenue in 
the draft 1993-94 budget on production levels of 1.8 million 
barrels per day [bpd], at an average price per barrel of $14. 
Oil revenue in the first half of the current fiscal year 
(July-December 1993) was approximately 1.235 billion Kuwaiti 
dinars [KD]. This means that it was a little higher than budget 
estimates, if it were computed on the basis of an entire year. 
  However, the present crisis in the oil market has forced the 
government to modify its estimates and compute oil revenues for 
the rest of the year at a production rate of a million bpd, at 
an average price of $10.50 per barrel. That is a healthy 
direction. 
  The government estimates that if the current level of oil 
prices continues, it will add 210 million more dinars to the 
estimated budget deficit, which will total KD1.2 billion, if we 
exclude the savings from income earmarked for future 
generations' reserve. 
  The government estimates the deficit for half the fiscal 
year 
at KD820 million, as a result of its disbursing more than half 
of the budget credits. Total remitted to the ministries, 
agencies, and organizations was ID2.221 billion, an average of 
KD370 million a month or about $1.2 billion. This is not a good 
indicator since, usually, actual expenditures are less than 
estimates. If disbursement rates continue as they are, they 
could put pressure on future budget credits. The numbers put 
forth by the government do not reflect the country's actual 
financial position for a half year, nor the estimated position 
for a full year. There is either a lack of comprehensiveness in 
the draft budget or the government's estimates, because of 
reduced revenue and expenditures outside of the budget. 
  The part pertaining to oil dealt with less than half of the 
known developments in that sector, such as the rise in 
production rates during 1993 from 1.5 million bpd to 2 million 
barrels daily, after OPEC's recent agreement. There was also the 
increase in refining capacity from 415,000 bpd to 580,000 
barrels, following the resumption of operations of most of Ash 
Shu'aybah's refinery units. The report confirms the initialling 
of an agreement to establish a new petrochemical complex, 
costing--by previous statements--about $2 billion. The important 
matter is that the project will have foreign participation. 
  The report also dealt with the monetary and banking sector 
and referred to the rise in private sector deposits with 
commercial banks. However, it mentioned that most of the 
increase was in deposits of foreign currencies, attributing that 
to the banks' fear of accepting Kuwaiti dinar deposits, in view 
of their expectations of a greater drop in interest rates for 
the dinar, on the one hand, and because of the dearth of local 
investment opportunities on the other. The increase in private 
sector deposits totaled KD339 million. The deposits in foreign 
currency were KD234 million, or 69 percent of the total. The 
Central Bank believes that the lowering of interest rates and 
activity of the Kuwaiti securities market contributed to the 
9.7-percent increase in volume of credit incentives in November 
1993 over December 1992. About 39 percent of those incentives 
were personal. 
  In another matter, the report stated that the development of 
foreign trade statistics lagged five months behind, since they 
only cover the first seven months of 1993. This is 
unjustifiable. Those statistics show a trade surplus of around 
KD522 million, since the value of exports was KD1.678 billion, 
while imports totaled KD1.156 billion. The latter number is 
close to pre-invasion levels, because imports totaled KD1.146 
billion for the first seven months in 1990.

<F P=106> [Article by Hatim al-Bitiwi from Rabat: "Ali Yata Calls for </F>
Resumption of Dialogue For Forming New Moroccan Government"] 
  [Text] Ali Yata, secretary general of the Party of Progress 
and Socialism, called for the resumption of dialogue for forming 
a new government. He called for a firm resolve to prevail in 
that dialogue for reaching an agreement which would be 
consistent with the national interest and responsive to the 
aspirations of the Moroccan people. 
  Yata, who was speaking at a press conference that was held 
yesterday in Rabat, said, "The circumstances are right for such 
an agreement to be reached provided we start our quest with the 
premise that there are no pending issues which are impervious to 
solutions." He pointed out that a solution was always possible 
when the will to find it precedes the effort that is made to 
find it. 
  The secretary general of the Party of Progress and Socialism 
pointed out that the general national consensus was that 
bringing about total change was extremely necessary. He added 
that the present government had no credibility and that its 
weakness was evident in the discussion, which is taking place at 
the present time, about this year's state budget. Not only was 
its term not extended for an additional month, it seemed also 
that it might be overtaken by the month of Ramadan, the month of 
fasting. 
  Yata pointed out that it was the failure to deal with the 
situation politically that brought the country to this impasse. 
He said that the forces of change represented the only way for 
bringing about the radical change that was required. He called 
for the reorganization of the Unified Front of the Moroccan 
Opposition Forces, and he asked that the reorganization be 
conducted without partisan fanaticism, in a spirit of 
understanding and responsibility. 
  Yata spoke about Morocco. He said that while the country was 
stable, it was everyone's national duty to concede that the 
masses in cities and villages were very worried because of the 
large number of unemployed youth in those cities and villages. 
  Yata confirmed that what can be found deep inside Moroccan 
society must be taken into account. He pointed out that the 
outcome [of the current situation] could be unpleasant and that 
it might be similar to the bloody events which happened in Fes 
and Tangier on 14 December 1990. He warned that the current 
situation could lead to the same events. 
  Yata mentioned that his party does not want to take Morocco 
backwards, but that it is rather the opinion of his party that 
an effort be made to move beyond the present situation and set 
the process of change in motion. No one disputes that this 
process is necessary. 
  Yata said there was nothing new in the statement on 
democracy 
that was issued by the three parties of the democratic bloc, the 
Istiqlal Party, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the 
Organization of Democratic Popular Action, and he pointed out 
that there was a set of ideas that these parties had compiled in 
a document. That statement on democracy was issued on the 50th 
anniversary of the day on which the document calling for the 
independence of Morocco was presented. 
  Yata added that as he read that statement, he got no sense 
of 
any escalation or justification for the boycott on the part of 
the three parties. He confirmed that there were ideas he agreed 
with and others that were debatable, and he said that he would 
like to discuss those ideas with yesterday's allies.

Firms Is 6,100; Industrial Production in Morocco Rises to DH115 
Billion; Textiles, Food, Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals Are Most 
Important Exports"] 
  [Text] The most recent official figures indicate that the 
value of industrial production in Morocco stands now at 
approximately 115 billion Moroccan dirhams [DH], that is, about 
a 4-percent increase over last year's level of production. The 
figures also indicate that the number of domestic and foreign 
industrial firms in Morocco stands now at 6,100. 
  The figures indicated that the rate of growth exceeded 7 
percent in the dehydrated and canned food industries and 
amounted to 8 percent in the paper industry. It was 11 percent 
in construction materials, 16 percent in tobacco and beverages, 
and between 3 and 5 percent in the remaining conversion 
industries. 
  An official at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry &amp; 
Privatization in Rabat told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that approximately 
351,000 workers are now employed as permanent workers in the 
conversion industries, and 86,000 workers are employed in those 
industries on a seasonal basis. The total number of workers, 
which is 437,000, represents about a 3-percent increase over the 
total number of employed workers last year. 
  The ministry official said that total investments in the 
conversion industries rose by about 14 percent to DH9 billion. 
He added that a worker's average rate of productivity stands now 
at DH103,000. The industries with the highest returns are the 
tobacco and beverage industries where average worker production 
stood at DH980,000. In the pharmaceutical, food, and chemical 
industries, average productivity in those industries stood at 
DH339,000. 
  The ministry official said that production at the 
government's industrial firms now amounts to about 27 percent of 
total industrial production. He added that firms engaged in the 
production of food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals produce about 
three-quarters of the total output produced by the government's 
industrial firms. 
  The ministry official [also] said that the value of 
industrial exports rose by 4 percent to about DH29 billion. That 
is equal to about 63 percent of industrial imports. He said that 
the most important export industries were the chemical and 
pharmaceutical industries (24 percent of the total), the textile 
industry (23 percent), and the food processing industry (19 
percent). 
  The ministry official added that the number of exporting 
firms stands at 1,600, a figure which represents about 28 
percent of the total number of industrial firms. He said that 
these firms contribute more than half the industrial production 
and employ about 60 percent of industrial workers. 
  The number of firms in which foreign investors have a share 
stands at about 1,000. These firms produce approximately 
one-third of total industrial production. 
  Investment by foreign capital in the conversion industries 
amounts to about 15 percent of total investment in those 
industries. The value added to conversion industries stands at 
about DH36 billion. That is about 15 percent of the total 
domestic added value.

<H3>  [Unattributed article: "Moroccan Organization for Human 
Rights Publishes Report on Those Who Died While in Government's 
Custody; More Than 17 Deaths in the Government's Police Stations 
and Dungeons Because of Mistreatment, Torture; Cases Were Not 
Properly Investigated"] </H3>
  [Text] El Yaagoubi Abdeljalil, a citizen, died 
approximately five years ago only two hours after he was 
arrested by police in Ouarzazate. The authorities claimed that 
Abdeljalil's death was merely a "suicide." Many people lost 
their lives, before and after Abdeljalil lost his, while they 
were guests of the government in its police stations and its 
public and secret detention centers. While the bodies of the 
dead were being carried out of the cold prison surroundings and 
taken to their graves for burial, questions about these deaths 
were relegated to oblivion. Even in official circles complaints 
filed by the victims' relatives and by human rights 
organizations fell on deaf ears. Officials paid no attention to 
these complaints just as they paid no attention to respecting 
people's right to life and to the dignity of those citizens who 
died in the government's dungeons. 
  Ever since its establishment in 1988 the Moroccan 
Organization for Human Rights has given maximum attention to 
those deaths that occur in centers that are subordinate to the 
judicial police and local authorities and those that result from 
the use of general force. It has demanded an investigation in 
each one of the many cases in which the victims' families had 
been persuaded to file complaints. The organization filed its 
own complaints and demanded civil rights [for the victims] but 
to no avail. All inquiries directed to the Ministry of Justice, 
in its capacity as the competent government authority that is 
responsible for the office of the attorney general, also went 
unanswered. Out of 17 cases recorded by the organization in 
which death had occurred under suspicious circumstances and the 
involvement of public officials was suspected, only two have 
been turned over to justice. 
  The Moroccan Organization for Human Rights issued a report 
on 
the subject yesterday. The report, which included incidents 
related to the deaths, listed those deaths from 1989 to 1993. 
The organization demanded that the Ministry of Justice tell the 
public what measures were taken by judicial authorities in all 
the cases discussed in the report. It also demanded that a fair 
investigation of those matters be duly held and that every 
official in the judicial police or with security forces be 
turned over to the competent courts if evidence is found against 
him that he was engaged in torture while a prisoner was in his 
custody or that he used unjustified force in the public street. 
The organization demanded that the court award the victims' 
families the compensation that they are entitled to receive. 
  The organization protested against all forms of evading 
punishment that infringe upon the notion of a state of law and 
order. Evading punishment infringes upon Morocco's international 
obligations and violates the protection clause for the 
fundamental rights of individuals. 
  Almost five years ago, on 4 February 1989 to be specific, El 
Yaagoubi Abdeljalil, a citizen, died just two hours after he was 
arrested by the police in Ouarzazate. At first, the death was 
considered a suicide. 
  The Moroccan Organization for Human Rights wrote to the 
Ministry of Justice, demanding an ordinary judicial 
investigation into the matter, and it filed a complaint 
demanding civil justice. The prosecution declared that there 
would be an investigation, but that announcement has had no 
effect to speak of to date. No security official was turned over 
to justice. Unfortunately, that was neither the first such case, 
nor was it the last. 
  Since then the organization has received several complaints 
from the families of citizens who died under identical 
circumstances in police stations, police centers, or in 
locations that are affiliated with local authorities. The press 
also featured other similar cases where death had occurred and 
local authorities, in most cases, had taken no action to respond 
or comment. Those matters that were brought to the 
organization's attention most recently have to do with the death 
of Mustapha Hamzaoui in Khenifra and Abdallah Bentaouet and 
Mounir Azzag in Tangier. 
  All inquiries sent to the Ministry of Justice, as the 
governmental authority that is responsible for the office of the 
attorney general, went unanswered, and none of the cases were 
turned over to justice, except for the 1989 case of Mr. Ben 
Khalifa Abderrahman in Ahwaz Marrakech and the 1991 case of Mr. 
Lamaskam El Hachemi in Casablanca. In those two cases death had 
occurred as a result of the two victims' being subjected to 
violence in the public street by public officials. 
  The authorities have always claimed that these cases were 
suicides and that those who died had hanged themselves. In 
making such a claim the authorities were relying on medical 
testimony or reports prepared mostly by physicians who are not 
forensic physicians and unaccompanied by a sanctioned attendance 
roster. And yet, most of the medical documents that were 
examined by attorneys or by the organization do not always 
categorically rule out that violence or torture was used on the 
victims. Also, the physicians who were charged with performing 
autopsies were not always independent, nor did they observe the 
principles of medical ethics. Furthermore, the suicide story was 
often contradicted by identical evidence that pertained to the 
material circumstances of the case (the method used to commit 
suicide, the characteristics of the building where the detainee 
was being held, and the limited period of time during which the 
person was detained: between a few hours and two days). The 
suicide story was also contradicted by the absence of clear 
motives for suicide. That is why we find that families were 
always rejecting the official story. 
  And yet it seems that most of the cases in which death had 
occurred under suspicious circumstances while a person was in 
custody or was being detained were closed after the office of 
the attorney general conducted what was merely an administrative 
procedure. No judicial investigation was conducted in those 
cases, and even the few that were investigated did not end up in 
court. 
  And yet, Morocco's penal code penalizes acts of violence 
committed by individuals, whoever they might be. And 14 years 
ago, the Moroccan state ratified the international convention on 
civil and political rights that renounces all forms of torture. 
In fact, it was recently, on 21 June 1994, that Morocco signed 
an agreement against torture and other forms of harsh, inhumane, 
or degrading treatment or punishment. 
  The organization had welcomed a review of the criminal 
guidelines that went into effect two years ago. These include 
some mechanisms to protect people from torture during the course 
of an interrogation. It seems that this measure and the 
instructions that accompanied it contributed to a reduction in 
the practice of torture, which, according to the testimony of 
many, occurred quite frequently until the end of 1990. 
  It has been noticed, nevertheless, that some public 
officials 
are still practicing torture. That was established in the courts 
in the cases of those citizens who were arrested in Bouznika 
during the June 1993 parliamentary elections, and it is also 
evident in the cases in which death had occurred in the past two 
years. 
  And yet, security officers do from time to time resort to 
the 
use of general force and physical violence as a way of 
controlling people. This happened in the case of Mr. Lamaskam El 
Hachemi in Casablanca and in the case of Nouaimi Mohamed in 
Rabat. This issue had previously been raised in the 
organization's report that was issued in the wake of the 
distressing events of December 1990. The organization calls 
attention to the fact that the use of general force is subject 
to specific international standards determined by the code of 
conduct for officials who are charged with implementing the laws 
that were approved by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 
1979. This code stipulates specifically that those officials 
cannot resort to the use of force unless it becomes absolutely 
necessary. If force must be used, it is to be used within the 
boundaries that are required for the performance of their duties. 
  The case of Mr. Benmouh who died in the police station in 
Rabat on 30 September 1990 shows that first aid was denied to a 
person who had asthma and who had been arbitrarily arrested 
during a police raid. 
  In December the organization's national office decided to 
issue a report on this matter after noticing that there had been 
no follow-up on 15 of the 17 cases that it had recorded as cases 
in which a public official might have been involved. In 
addition, all the efforts made by the organization to get 
officials to respond to this matter went unanswered. 
  In the meantime, the minister of justice indicated 
specifically in his answer to a question posed by a 
representative about one of the last three cases that, "It is 
inconceivable that people who are supposed to protect lives and 
property turn around and attack lives and property. When 
something like that happens, it behooves the king's deputy to go 
to the location where such an incident took place and conduct an 
investigation that must be thorough and must reveal everything. 
  "Complaints have been filed by the families with the 
investigating magistrate, and investigations into those 
complaints will run their course. It is inconceivable that a 
criminal, regardless of his social status, would go unpunished." 
  In putting in the record the content of this statement, 
which 
differs from the position that was taken by public authorities, 
the national office of the Moroccan Organization for Human 
Rights is demanding [the following]: 
1. 

  1. That the Ministry of Justice announce to the 
public the measures that are being taken by the judicial 
authorities, and specifically, by the competent district 
attorneys, on all the issues raised in this report; 
  2. That a fair judicial investigation be conducted in 
accordance with the law. Since the facts of this case are not 
old, an investigation cannot be impeded by the fact that a 
decision to close the case was made by the office of the 
attorney general; 
  3. That every officer in the judicial police or in the 
security forces against whom there is evidence that he became 
engaged in torturing a prisoner who was in his custody be taken 
to a duly qualified court of law where he may be duly tried in 
accordance with the requirements of the penal code. The same 
would apply to one who used unjustifiable violence in the public 
street. 
  4. That the courts award the victims' families the 
compensation to which they are entitled. 
  The National Office of the Moroccan Organization for Human 
Rights protests all forms of evading punishment that run counter 
to the notion of a law and order state. Evading punishment also 
runs counter to our country's international commitments and 
violates the protection clause for individuals' fundamental 
rights. Proper application of the law against those who engage 
in torture is an unavoidable requirement for the elimination of 
a terrible practice that was too often used during preliminary 
investigations. Torture was even sometimes practiced outside 
those preliminary investigations. The practice of torture is an 
unacceptable violation of a person's right to life, his right to 
be free from bodily harm, and his right to dignity. 
<H5>  A List of Victims from 1989 to 1993 </H5>

'Abd-al-Haqq: "Abu Dhabi Court Postpones Case of BCCI Accused; 
Movement to Expedite Decision, Preparatory to Surrendering 
Naqawi to the United States"] 
  [Text] The Abu Dhabi Criminal Court, at the end of its 
closed session held yesterday, 22 January 1994, decided to 
postpone the trial of those accused in the Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International [BCCI] case until 5 February 1994. 
  In justifying its decision to hear the case in closed 
sessions beginning with yesterday's session, the court stated 
that "this is in conformity with the Penal Code and the adoption 
of considerations related to public law, in view of current 
circumstances and ramifications, especially pertaining to the 
public interest and the position of the accused. Therefore, the 
court deems it appropriate to hear the case in closed session." 
  Defense sources said that, in the course of the trial 
yesterday, nothing occurred to make it necessary to change to 
closed sessions. Most of the points raised had already been 
raised in one form or another in previous sessions. 
  Defense sources also stated that the postponement for two 
weeks instead of a month, as was the case in past sessions, 
reflected the court's desire to expedite completion of the trial 
and the issuing of verdicts. 
  These sources have expressed the belief that the sessions 
will begin to be expedited, with greater progress being made in 
the case. Sessions could be consecutive, at a rate of one every 
two or three days. 
  Nevertheless, lawyers have refused to offer any 
interpretation for the reasons for expediting the trial. 
However, circles close to the litigation widely believe that 
expediting the trial proceedings is related to the agreement to 
hand over the second accused, Swaleh Naqvi, to the United 
States. It is said that he will be surrendered within 120 days. 
  These circles stated that Naqvi cannot be surrendered while 
his trial continues in Abu Dhabi. Perhaps this means that Abu 
Dhabi is inclined to conclude the trial by next April, in order 
to facilitate his surrender to American judicial authorities. 
  Counselor Muhammad Tamam, who is defending Naqvi, said that 
he will not object to turning Naqvi over and that the trial that 
Naqvi will have in the United States is related to other 
matters, which are unconnected to the Abu Dhabi trial. Naqvi 
will be asked about violations pertaining to the establishment 
of banks within the United States. 
<H5>  Reasons for Postponement </H5>
  After the closed session, the Abu Dhabi court issued a 
report 
concerning the reasons for postponing the session yesterday. It 
stated that the postponement was to give the defense the 
opportunity to peruse all the documents presented to the court, 
as well as to give them an opportunity to examine the Public 
Prosecutor Office's memorandum, which had been submitted during 
yesterday's session, and to give those who so desired a copy of 
this memorandum. Another reason was to re-advise the first 
accused, Agha Hassan Abedi, in writing, and to re-advise the 
accused Ziauddin Akbar, who is imprisoned in Britain, by 
diplomatic means. 
  The two accused were notified two weeks ago, but judicial 
sources stated that the fact that they were outside the country 
necessitated informing them again, so that they could have more 
time. 
  At yesterday's session, the public prosecutor raised the 
question of conflicts among the defendants' interests, 
particularly those who are being defended by one lawyer. The 
prosecution has requested that the defense be confined to one 
defendant, since certain lawyers are defending several accused 
at one time. 
  The lawyers thought the request strange, because this 
question was discussed at the trial's first session. In the 
prosecutor's presence, the judge had ruled that certain lawyers 
could continue to defend two defendants at the same time, when 
there was no conflict of interests. Yesterday, the court put off 
consideration of the prosecution's request concerning the 
question of conflict. It also agreed to hand over a copy of the 
Ernst and Young, which is a part of the court records. 
<H5>  Lawyers' Requests </H5>
  At yesterday's session, the lawyers presented a joint 
memorandum of requests relative to a number of defendants. One 
of the most important of these requests was for files pertaining 
to the shareholders' management committee, which was formed by 
representatives of senior shareholders, whose members include 
Ghanim Faris al-Mazru'i and Jaw'an Salim al-Zahiri. The request 
also included calling the committee members to testify, if 
necessary. 
  The lawyers submitted justifications for their requests. In 
their memorandum, they said that these files might prove that 
the suspicious loans, which their clients have been accused of 
making, were made with the knowledge and approval of the 
management committee, since they are influential persons with 
right of disposition in accordance with the law. The memorandum 
stated that compliance with this request might change the course 
of the lawsuit. 
  In their joint memorandum, the lawyers requested the minutes 
of actions and meetings of the certified accountants (Arthur 
Andersen), which were conducted with the accused, because they 
contain documents and records upon which their report was based. 
This is required to enable the defendants to express their views 
about these documents. 
  In their joint memorandum, the lawyers for the accused asked 
for the reports of the accounting investigators of Price, 
Waterhouse, the report of Neil Blair, and the report of the law 
firm Allen and Afri [name as transliterated]. To justify this 
request, the lawyers said that these reports clarify the bank's 
situation. If they can establish that the accounts and 
restrictions were healthy, then the accused would be cleared of 
criminal activity. 
  The lawyers also requested the report of Ernst and Young, 
upon which the public prosecutor's office has relied. They are 
claiming civil rights, since the prosecution has not enabled the 
defense to examine it, despite the fact that it constitutes 
evidence. 
  They also requested the files of loans related to the 
charges 
against their clients, since these files constitute the "body of 
crime." This would require placing those files in the court's 
custody and consequently enabling the accused to examine them, 
in order to show the soundness of procedures followed. 
  The lawyers pointed out that some of these loans had been 
paid in full, while certain defendants have been implicated in 
other loans without their having had a role regarding them, 
inasmuch as these loans were made outside their jurisdictions or 
after the approval of responsible officials. 
  In their memorandum, the lawyers requested that the accused 
be released without bail. They pointed out that all the charges 
related to them are connected and cannot be separated, inasmuch 
as they must be considered one crime in accordance with Article 
88 of the United Arab Emirates' Unified Penal Code. The maximum 
punishment for this crime is three years. In view of the fact 
that the accused have in fact completed that, they ought to be 
released at once, because of the legal invalidity of their being 
detained.

<F P=106> [Article by Kumar Anand: "Digvijay Singh is in the Spiral of </F>
Trying to Escape Arjun Singh's Shadow"] 
  [Text] Chhindwara, 17 January--Madhya Pradesh Chief 
Minister Digvijay Singh and Central Environment State Minister 
Kamal Nath may not be as strong supporter of Central Human 
Resources Development Minister Arjun Singh as they were in the 
past, however, they are not in the mood for a direct 
confrontation with him, either. Both have set up their official 
lines. They hope that Arjun Singh will not dissect those. Arjun 
Singh had told a legislator who is angry at the Digvijay Singh 
cabinet that Digvijay Singh was not obeying him. Still, if he 
has to choose between this legislator and the chief minister, he 
will have to pick the chief minister. This legislator is the 
same as that had helped Arjun Singh openly in his anti-Rao 
campaign. Digvijay Singh is concerned with freeing his image 
from Arjun Singh's shadow. However, this freedom cannot fit in 
Arjun Singh's politics. Therefore, we can assume there are many 
possibilities and concerns embedded in this separate stand. 
  On the other end, Madhav Rao Scindia's close associates 
maintain that all this a staged drama and deep down in his heart 
Digvijay Singh is still with Arjun Singh. Not only the 
nominations of his cabinet members but also their appointments 
to different departments were decided by Arjun Singh. They give 
the example of Scindia-supporter Mahender Singh in support of 
this argument. It is said that Digvijay Singh had promised him 
the position of minister of industries, however, later gave him 
the education portfolio. The industries department went to Arjun 
Singh's brother-in-law Rajender Singh. The chief minister 
reportedly told Mahender Singh that Arjun Singh wanted an able 
minister in education department so that this department works 
according to his wishes. The directors of the new equation in 
the cabinet say that Rajender Singh has access to Arjun Singh. 
They should have further asked why did Arjun Singh make such a 
close relative a minister. Those who are legislators now can 
become ministers. They have to keep in mind who supported whom 
in the past. Both Digvijay Singh and Kamal Nath were also with 
Arjun Singh. Digvijay Singh's appointment as chief minister had 
affected Madhav Rao Scindia most. Digvijay Singh and Mr. Scindia 
are from the same region--Gwalior-Chambal. Close associates of 
Kamal Nath say that Mr. Scindia had told Kamal Nath that either 
he should become the chief minister or endorse him (Scindia). 
Later Kamal Nath was told that only Digvijay Singh would be 
appointed as the chief minister. Mr. Scindia had the Punjab 
government airplane waiting for him. However, the opportunity 
for him to go to Bhopal never came. The supporters of this 
mother-son due say that while they both--Vijyaraje Scindia and 
Madhav Rao Scindia--may appear to oppose each other, they care 
for each other's political interests. Mrs. Scindia, while she 
was living in Gwalior, did not address even one public meeting 
during the vidhan sabha elections. However, she visited Digvijay 
Singh's constituency several times. Anyhow, Madhav Rao Scindia, 
instead of becoming uneasy by this development, is considering 
it an act of fate at this time. 
  The supporters of Arjun Singh's "theory about backward 
groups" see Madhav Rao Scindia clearly covered under it. They 
say that Mr. Scindia would be considered belonging to a backward 
group according to Madhya Pradesh criteria. Arjun Singh had 
floated Mr. Scindia's name before he used Subhas Yadav's name 
for chief minister's position. Mr. Digvijay Singh himself does 
not hesitate expressing his disagreement over this backward 
theory' with Arjun Singh. In an answer to a JANSATTA 
correspondent's question while returning from Chandamota to 
Bhopal, he had said that a lot had been written about his 
relationship with Arjun Singh. "Arjun Singh and I think alike. 
We both have the same ideas about the problems in Madhya 
Pradesh. We have worked in politics together for 16 years 
because of the similarity of our ideas, and not because of our 
personal relations. However, I do not agree with his comment 
that only a member of scheduled castes, aborigines, backward 
classes, and minorities can serve those groups. Mahatma Gandhi 
did not belong to any of these groups, however, he served these 
groups more than anyone else." 
  Mr. Digvijay Singh says that these groups need social 
justice. It is important to win their trust to take strict 
action if they are subjected to unfair treatment. He is also 
keeping in mind why the legislators belonging to scheduled 
castes, aborigines, and the backward groups elected him the 
chief minister even though they all were consulted individually. 
He was asked why had he mentioned Kamal Nath's name in the 
context of his being elected chief minister, but had never 
mentioned Arjun Singh's name. Digvijay Singh asked, "What is the 
purpose of mentioning Arjun Singh's name in Chhindwara?" When 
asked if it was true that Scindia was upset with the cabinet, he 
replied, "He has been very cooperative." We asked him, "Before 
becoming the chief minister, you had said that the prime 
minister should apologize to the Muslims." Digvijay Singh's 
reply after becoming the chief minister was, "That is in the 
past. It is not necessary to repeat it now. The prime minister 
has already expressed his regret." Digvijay Singh does 
understand the difference between regret' and apology.' 
  Digvijay Singh explained his policy over the communalism 
issue. "I have told the police and administrative officials not 
to hire any person who has any connection with a communal group 
or is involved in communal activities to any government 
committee. The social positions of such persons is enhanced if 
they are allowed to associate with high-level government 
officials. Additionally, we ignore secular persons this way." 
When asked if the government officers would not cause problems 
by labeling a person of being communalist, he replied, 
"Sometime, little rocks are also ground with the wheat. We just 
cannot avoid it." 
  Madhya Pradesh' chief minister, Digvijay Singh, has already 
established his priorities. He wants to hold elections of local 
governments and panchayats before June. After that, he will 
appoint a 90-member legislative commission. He says about it 
that all orders will be issued through the cabinet members. At 
present, he wants to expand or revise his cabinet appointments. 
One of his priority is to supply kerosene oil in villages at 
controlled rates. When he had asked the villagers in his 
meetings about the price of kerosene oil, he was told they 
bought it at 7 to 9 rupees per liter. He also said that patwaris 
and gardawars [civil servants] will go to villages to process 
land sale and transfer documents. The villagers have told him in 
one of his meetings that they have to pay as much as 1,000 
rupees in bribes for preparing transfer documents. He had called 
Ashok Awasthi, then-tehsildar of Machagora, to the stage and 
asked him to explain himself. He sent him back and told him to 
straighten out the situation within three months or he will have 
to straighten him out himself. 
  The chief minister said about these announcements that these 
will not burden the state treasury; just have to make the system 
more effective. He has announced opening a 30-bed hospital in 
each development district and providing free electricity for an 
engine of up to five horsepower to every farmer before 1 
February. Both these promises are included in the Congress (I) 
election brochure. Mr. Suresh Pichauri, the state Congress (I) 
general secretary, replied to a JANSATTA question, "We had 
discussed the financial aspects of this plan after meeting three 
times before we included it in our state brochure." He made an 
important announcement in Pandhurna about appointing public 
commissions at district levels. He has made the announcement to 
make a survey of unemployed educated young people and offer 
either a job or unemployment benefits to those with family 
income of less than 6,000 rupees. 
  The people have become more hopeful with these attractive 
announcements. He understands also the political results if 
these hopes are not fulfilled. Since he was appointed the chief 
minister only five weeks ago, only the future will tell how 
these promises are kept. The chief minister announced in 
Machagiri, "Kamal Nath and I will make surprise visits to one or 
the other village without telling the officials and take action 
against those who are making problems." This shows his desire to 
continue his association with Kamal Nath. His cabinet members 
know the meanings of these announcements. When the chief 
minister himself recognizes him as the king-maker, why should 
the minister hesitate in praising them falsely and opening up 
the government coffers for them? That was apparent during their 
two-day trip. However, behind political friendships, there are 
fears about political enmity also.

<F P=106> [Article: "Alternative Budget Will Repudiate Government </F>
Claims"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 23 January--Just like last year, an 
alternative budget will be presented this year again. This 
budget will nullify the government claim that there is no 
alternative to the new economic policy which means dependence of 
foreign debts. This can be called a citizens' budget. Through 
this citizens' budget, they are trying to raise a national 
movement against the government's economic policy. All 
organizations are participating in it. This is a new dimension 
of the alternative budget. 
  A citizens council is working to find an alternative to the 
government's economic policies. Prof. Arun Kumar is its 
organizer. This council has economists, political leaders, 
social workers, and actors as its members. A preliminary efforts 
was made by them last year. They had also presented model of an 
alternative budget. This time, the concept of this alternative 
budget is becoming a movement. Next month, on 13-14 February, a 
conference will be held at Gandhi Shanti Pratisthan. The 
alternative budget will be approved at that time. 
  The new economic policy of the government, meaning of 
Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh, is pressured by all kind of 
limitations. The dependence on foreign debts is known to all. It 
has become a common knowledge that the government had written 
the 1991 budget under pressure from the IMF and the World Bank. 
Manmohan Singh is the creator of the new economic policy. He was 
an economic advisor in the Chandra Shekhar government. A report 
was sent by the World Bank during those days. This report was 
kept hidden from Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. It is a secret 
as to who made that decision. Was the decision made because of 
World Bank pressure? This new economic policy was born from that 
report. Because of its dangerous aspects, the citizens council 
was created in December 1992 and it is still working. Prof. Arun 
Kumar says that the alternative budget will be able to solidly 
refute the government claims. The government claims that the 
path it has taken is the only alternative. He maintains that it 
is not true. 
  The alternative budget will show that if the nation uses its 
own resources properly, it will not need to borrow from abroad. 
The government opposed to it says that foreign debts are 
necessary and unavoidable. The decision to accept the Dunkel 
proposal is part of this effort. The alternative budget will 
show that. The alternative budget points to black money for 
resource. Arun Kumar says that at least 30 percent of the total 
economy is in black money, and it is not openly visible. Prof. 
Surajbhan Gupta had estimated in 1987 that this portion was 47 
percent. According to Prof. Surajbhan Gupta, there are over four 
trillion rupees in black money in our economic system. Prof. 
Arun Kumar estimates this amount to be 2.5 trillion rupees. 
  If we are successful to bring this portion under a taxation 
system to the government treasury, it is estimated that the 
government will earn 1.1 trillion rupees. At present the 
government earns only 200 billion rupees in direct taxes. The 
total budget deficit is 370 billion rupees. Even after paying 
that deficit, the government will save 630 billion rupees. The 
alternative budget emphasizes bringing the black money into the 
taxation system. It pushes for expanding the sphere of direct 
taxes. At present about six to seven million people are covered 
by direct taxes. 
  If we change the meaning of this government looking after 
the 
interests of only three percent of the population, we will be 
able to understand the philosophy behind the alternative budget. 
They want to bring those three percent population under the 
taxation system to protect the interests of the rest of the 
population. Can strong political desire be changed in support of 
it? This question is under discussion in this council. A 
workshop was called in October 1993 to discuss the alternative 
budget and the fact that our foreign currency deficit is related 
to the black money was discussed at that time. The foreign 
currency deficit is about 210 billion rupees. It is important to 
know that foreign exchange of about 450 billion rupees goes out 
of the country because of black money. In addition, political 
leaders, businessmen, and industrialists are sending about 180 
billion rupees abroad underreference' plan. According to one 
estimate, between 1.8 trillion to 6 trillion rupees from our 
economy are in other countries. The interest on it is about 180 
billion rupees which does not come to our country. 
  The truth is that the effort to make an alternative economic 
policy is a part of the swadeshi movement. More people are 
joining it now. Representatives of other campaigns are also 
joining it. The alternative budget will be an exercise. 
Sub-committees on agriculture, imports-exports, employment,

<F P=106> [Commentary by Radhanath Chaturvedi: "Challenges Before the </F>
Finance Minister in the New Budget"; quotation marks as 
published] 
  [Text] The central government budget is to be presented in 
the Parliament on 28 February. Unless something unforeseen 
happens, the budget this year will be presented on or before 28 
February. Before it, the traditional financial survey will be 
presented. 
  Due to the accusations levied in the report that the Joint 
Parliamentary Committee (JPC) had presented, Manmohan Singh, and 
not others, had submitted his resignation. This resignation had 
created an atmosphere of uncertainty. The prime minister, by 
rejecting it, had removed this fog of uncertainty. 
  Whether Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was right or wrong in 
doing so is not appropriate for discussion here. We have to 
limit our discussion here to inflation and other economic issues. 
  The Congress (I) could not reduce prices of commodities 
within 100 days as it promised in its election manifesto. 
Instead, the prices increased. As for the present fiscal year, 
prices of coal and steel increased. This increase was affected 
by the government itself and did so by saying that their 
production costs had increased. The wages for laborers had to be 
increased. Almost a similar reason was given for increasing 
railway fares and cargo rates. Except for one time, the rate of 
inflation averaged 8.5 percent. If the finance minister wants to 
reduced budget deficit, which is his greatest challenge at this 
time, he must reduce inflation rate and prices of commodities. 
  We cannot say that nature is not helping the finance 
minister. Like the last five years, there were good rains this 
year also. More than 180 million tons of grains were produced. 
Production of oil seeds always cause concern, however, this year 
their production was satisfactory to an extent. Saurashtra, 
where we have good yield of peanuts, could not produce as good a 
peanut harvest as expected because of natural catastrophes. 
  Despite the good grains harvest and satisfactory oil seeds 
production, the prices of grains and oil seeds have increased. 
Even more troubling is the increase in pulses prices. In a 
country like India, be one rich or poor, pulses are the main 
source of proteins. Last year, pulses were around 15-16, and now 
arhar pulse, the most popular of the pulses, costs 23 rupees per 
kilogram. The same is true about mung, urd, and other pulses. 
  The combination of these reasons has increased the cost of 
living by 10.7 percent and the wholesale price index has gone up 
by 9 percent. The increase in inflation during this fiscal year 
will force the finance minister to seriously rethink his 
policies about prices and control in other areas. He has to keep 
in mind that there was no such thing as the Gulf war this year 
which could help an average citizen to understand the reason for 
price increase and excuse him for it. The government did lift 
control over the lubricants, however this could not have 
affected the inflation rate to rise 10-11 percent. What is the 
reason for it? The finance minister has to think about it. There 
was a rumor that the finance ministry was increasing petroleum 
prices to help reduce the cost of subsidies. However, there were 
elections in five states. Perhaps, that is why the finance 
ministry had to drop the idea of increasing petroleum prices. 
  If we look at the price indicators of the first half before 
December 1993, we will find that there was an increase of prices 
of almost all the listed items. The most significant aspect was 
the increase in electricity rates. The prices of fuel were also 
up. All these affect the common people. One reason for the 
increase in electricity rates is the widespread theft of 
electric power. The government of the Electricity Board is not 
able to stop it. This theft usually occurs where electricity 
lines pass through slums where they pirate electricity by 
connecting illegally. When the question of taken action against 
these arises, the electricity department is told to be quiet and 
do not do anything.' [sentence as published] The leaders tell 
them, "It is where we will get our votes from." In other 
category are those rich people who damage their meters. This 
question is related to ethics and should be corrected at that 
level. The consumers and the corrupt electricity department 
employees work together in stealing electricity this way. 
  The price indicator last year was 231, and it has increased 
to more than 240 this year. 
  The prices of grains increased by 8.8 percent, prices of 
pulses by 40 percent, and electricity rates by 37 percent. The 
rise prices of oil seeds was the least, a record of half 
percent. Sugar prices increased by about 30 percent. Other 
increases were: cloth 10 percent, steal by percent, and chemical 
products about 5 percent. Measures should be taken to stop 
additional increases, only then will the inflation be checked. 
  It is not impossible to do that. There was good agricultural 
production in 1992-93 and receipt were also good. Because of the 
additional agricultural production of 180 million, receipts were 
high again. By the middle of 1994, the government warehouses 
will be full with these collected grains. 
  In some parts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Punjab, 
the 
cotton crop was badly destroyed by disease. That led to the 
recent increase in cotton prices. Still, no demand was made to 
import cotton. This means that what was produced will meet the 
need of our country. It is true that there has been some 
reduction in the production of sugar. Compared to the 1992-93 
production of 13.4 million tons, this year the production was 
only 10.6 million tons, and this reduction has affected increase 
in its prices. It is estimated that the production of sugar will 
reach 11 million tons. 
  The challenge the finance minister has to meet while writing 
the 1994-95 budget will require help from gods. This help should 
be in the form of increased agricultural production. At the same 
time, there should a sizeable increase in industrial production. 
Chemical fertilizers and electric power must he provided to 
farmers and industrialists at subsidized rates. If it is not 
done then clearly the industrialists and farmers will not be 
able to do their job lacking these basic needs of production. If 
the rates of fertilizers and electricity increase, they will not 
have the purchasing power to meet their needs, and this will 
finally result in four-fold increase in prices.

<F P=106> [Article by Debashish Munshi: "Adapting to Changing </F>
Scenario: CPI-CPM Bid Not To Be Left Out"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, January 8. Red banners were ever so 
popular in the early 1960s. Those were the days when socialism 
was fashionable, the undivided Communist Party of India was the 
second largest party in Parliament, and the mighty Soviet Union 
was helping India set up massive public sector steel plants at 
Bhilai and Bokaro. 
  Three decades and a plastic surgery on the eco-political 
face 
of the country later, market-driven capitalism has obliterated 
the socialist goals of yesteryears, the public sector faces 
phased privatisation and a lonely Left movement is looking for 
committed allies to help put it back on the political road. This 
is a time for soul-searching for the Left parties in India for 
they know that unless they unite and re-adapt to the changing 
times they will be left behind in the race for political control. 
  "Contrary to what the popular media would like to believe, 
socialism is far from dead. It will survive. And nowhere is its 
future as bright as it is in the Third World, the most exploited 
part of human habitation," says the veteran CPI (Communist Party 
of India) leader, Mr M. Farooqui. 
  "But to be effective, we need to be united," Mr Farooqui 
acknowledges. It is this realisation that has brought the two 
principal Left parties, the CPI and the CPM (Communist Party of 
India-Marxist) closer to each other. Only recently, the general 
secretaries of the two parties, Mr Indrajit Gupta and Mr 
Harkishen Singh Surjeet, issued a joint circular, calling for 
the setting up of inter-party coordination committees at the 
state level. 
  For those who like to keep track of dates, it is significant 
that the friendly vibes between the two parties have come in a 
year that marks the 30th anniversary of the historic 1964 split 
in the Communist Party of India. It is no less significant that 
the CPI and the CPM have chosen Vijayawada as the venue of their 
forthcoming joint rally in Andhra Pradesh, the first in a very 
long time. It was in Vijayawada that the last party Congress of 
the undivided CPI was held way back in 1961. 
  "We have recognised the vital importance of Left unity," 
says 
the CPM politburo member, Mr Prakash Karat, "and are doing our 
utmost to achieve it." The recent central committee meeting of 
the CPM in Calcutta devoted considerable time to a discussion on 
this issue. The meeting, at least informally, also discussed the 
possibilities of identifying allies with whom the party could 
have electoral adjustments. 
  As a senior Left leader put it, "The unity of the Left and 
democratic forces is the only way to meet the threat from 
right-wing, communal and fascist parties." During the last few 
years, the Left has been holding on to the shirt tail of the 
National Front led by Mr V.P. Singh's Janata Dal. But now that 
the National Front has withered away and the Janata Dal is 
nothing but a shadow of its past, the Left has no option but to 
choose new partners for itself. 
  On the face of it, many consider Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav's 
Samajwadi Party (SP) to be an ideal partner of the Left as Yadav 
not only calls himself a socialist but, had once even described 
his party as a "real Left party." 
  Though he still has a lot of respect and goodwill for the 
Left, Mr Yadav is more than a bit miffed about the manner in 
which the Left Front "ditched" him during the recent assembly 
elections in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] "If the Left had stood by us 
as we had expected it to do, we would have got an absolute 
majority in the House," Mr Yadav says. Mr Yadav has another 
reason to be cautious about any understanding with the Left. His 
comrade-in-arms, Mr Kanshi Ram of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), 
has been involved in a bitter war of words with Communist 
leaders over who really represents the poor and the downtrodden 
in the country. And Mr Yadav, can ill afford to antagonise Mr 
Kanshi Ram at this juncture. 
  Fundamental differences between the mainline Communist 
parties like the CPI and the CPM on the one hand and the "Far 
Left" represented by groups like the Indian People's Front (IPF) 
have been stumbling blocks in the way of a broader Left unity. 
  The radical Left has made its presence felt among the 
student 
community. "With our string of successes in university elections 
across the Hindi heartland, we are beginning to be noticed," 
says Mr Vinod Mishra, the firebrand Naxalite who came overground 
sometime ago to head the Liberation group of the CPI 
(Marxist-Leninist), a major constituent of the IPF. 
  The campuses that were won over by the All India Students' 
Association (AISA), the students' wing of the IPF, include the 
Benaras Hindu University, -- for long a stronghold of the Akhil 
Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a BJP (Bharatiya Janata 
Party) affiliate. Apart from storming the "saffron bastion" of 
U.P., the AISA humbled the Students' Federation of India (SFI), 
a CPM affiliate, in the Jawaharlal Nehru University students' 
union elections. 
  "There are persisting differences among the various Left 
groups but a functional unity is within our reach," feels Mr 
Mishra. After all, he says, the SFI and AISA activists 
cooperated with each other during the recent students' agitation 
in Bihar. 
  For many Left watchers, the Communist movement in India can 
survive only if the Left parties change gears to keep pace with 
developments worldwide. Leaders like Mr Farooqui are already 
beginning to look at China and Vietnam as role models. Both 
these countries, he says, have pushed through economic reforms 
while maintaining a tight leash on the political structure of 
their countries. China, he points out, has opened up its economy 
but has taken care to protect its national interests by refusing 
to sign GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). 
  But, Left watchers point out that economic reforms is not 
the 
only aspect of "changing gears." They refer to the faint signs 
of a schism within the principal Left parties on the ticklish 
issue of internal democracy. The expulsion of Ms K.R. Gowri, a 
Communist to the core and a pioneer in evolving progressive 
agrarian reforms in Kerala, from the CPM for raising a voice of 
dissent, is seen by many as "counter-productive" to the party's 
interests. Mr Karat, however, disagrees. "The party is more 
important than any individual. The individual is what he or she 
is because of the party," he says. 
  Left leaders, however, agree that a certain amount of 
flexibility is essential to bring about Left unity. Both Mr 
Farooqui and Mr Karat are unanimous in the view that a joint 
struggle against the economic policies of the government can be 
an effective first step in uniting "Left and democratic forces."

<F P=106> [Article by Military Affairs editor] </F>
  [Text] Since the end of the Gulf war, Iran has turned into 
the most dangerous country in the area by virtue of its pursuit 
of a massive rearmament policy encompassing conventional, 
chemical ,and nuclear weaponry, to the degree that all of the 
classified military reports warn continually of the Iranian 
threat looming over the Gulf. The situation has prompted a 
return of the arms race to the countries of the region, which 
have sought to obtain defensive systems. Dubai's recent airshow 
is a reflection of this anxiety-driven climate, wherein all 
weapons-manufacturing countries [exhibitions] had crowds. What 
is the true nature of the Iranian threat, and how should the 
countries of the region confront it? 
  Weeks after the end of the Gulf war, the major 
industrialized 
countries called for the imposition of an embargo on weapons 
exports to the developing nations. In the opinion of the 
"majors," advanced weaponry in the hands of the "minors" would 
necessarily lead to the flare-up of wars, in contrast to the 
situation among the former. Rearmament among the majors has a 
deterrent goal; in essence, the availability of effective 
weaponry to a given state leads to other states' fearing to 
attack it. This logic underlay the formation of the "nuclear 
strike force" in France during the reign of General Charles de 
Gaulle. The rationale was that the existence of such a 
formidable force in France, in the first and last instance, 
would be a deterrent to others against launching a war against 
France, and not that France would launch a nuclear attack 
against the enemy. All nuclear nations adopted this Gaullist 
nuclear logic, and none deviated from it except for Russia, 
recently. A fortnight ago, the Russian minister of defense 
stated that his country would respond with nuclear weapons to 
any attack on its territory using conventional weapons. 
  Addressing members of Congress in March 1991, one week after 
the end of the Gulf war, former U.S. President George Bush 
expressed his fear of the smaller countries' arming, especially 
those of the Middle East. "It is catastrophic, now that the war 
is over, for Middle Eastern and Arab Gulf countries to enter a 
new arms race." 
  Bush failed in the U.S. presidential elections, and with him 
fell the theory of arms limitation (in the Middle East and 
elsewhere), because the weapons-manufacturing lobby has the 
ability to find any justification for selling weapons, and even 
for participating in the escalation of regional crises and 
tensions in order that the volume of sales not be affected. 
  What has survived is merely the theory of the prevention of 
the deployment of (nuclear, biological, and chemical) weapons of 
mass destruction. 
  Dubai's recent airshow witnessed the largest gathering of 
producers of civilian and military aircraft, missiles, 
electronics, and radars, not to mention radar jamming equipment. 
  Russia staged an aerial demonstration of the "Sukhoi 35," 
its 
latest aircraft. Besides its aircraft, Britain dispatched Crown 
Prince Charles to carry out public relations for the British 
aircraft manufacturers. France sent its minister of defense and 
industry, who doubles as the minister of foreign trade. 
  Warplane manufacturers' mouths watered when the UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] announced its desire to purchase 80 advanced 
fighter aircraft at a cost of no less than $10 billion. Experts 
have estimated the cost of arms purchases in the Gulf area for 
the remainder of the century at $65 billion. 
  There is competition between the United States and France 
for 
the arms market, with the United States ahead by leagues. Since 
1990, [the United States] has sold $39 billion worth of weapons 
to the countries of the region. As for France, do not forget 
that it was Iraq's primary arms supplier prior to the Gulf war. 
Thirty percent of its military exports in the years 1982, 1983, 
1984, and 1985 were to Iraq alone (13 billion French francs per 
year), and 70 percent of its military sales were to Middle 
Eastern and North African countries. France has succeeded in 
striking large deals in at least three Gulf countries, the most 
significant of which is the provision of 436 large LeClerc tanks 
to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
  In addition to the United States and France, Russia (which 
dominated the advanced countries' markets in the region during 
the Soviet Union era), Italy, Britain and Germany were 
represented, not to mention new countries such as South Africa 
and the Czech Republic, in addition to China and North Korea. 
  Prior to the Gulf war, Iraqi leaders were under the 
impression that their country had become the primary regional 
military power following the end of the Iraqi-Iranian war in 
mid-1988. 
<H5>  Iranian Arsenal </H5>
  Following the Gulf war and the defeat of the Iraqi Army, 
Iran 
once again stood out as a regional military power. The rulers of 
Tehran drafted a large rearmament program based on a declared 
annual military outlay of $8 billion. This vast sum drained the 
Iranian budget and overburdened the Iranian economy and is the 
reason for the inflation now extant in Iran, as well as the poor 
exchange rate of the Iranian currency. 
  The focus of Iran's military programs was its naval fleet. 
The prevailing view is that Iran has purchased three 
"Kilo"-class Russian submarines, taken delivery of two of them, 
and is awaiting delivery of the last one at the start of next 
year. However, it has recently been revealed that the "Kilo" 
submarine deal signed by Iran with Russia involves seven, not 
three, submarines. 
  Each "Kilo" submarine is capable of carrying 18 torpedoes or 
36 naval mines, and is equipped with four surface-to-air 
"SAM-16" missiles. In early 1993, Iran received an estimated 
1,800 "Kilo"-compatible naval mines. 
  The most important development in the rearmament of Iran, 
however, has been its formation of a squadron of "Sukhoi 24" 
strike fighters. In the opinion of American military experts in 
the region, the threat to shipping in the Gulf that is posed by 
these aircraft is greater than that posed by the "Kilo" 
submarines. 
  Negotiations are in their advanced states between Iran and 
China on the supply to Iran of 10 "Hegu" fast boats equipped 
with "Ying-Ji" antiship missiles with a range of 40 km. 
  A report entitled "The Strategic Plan for the Intelligence 
World in the Nineties," submitted by CIA Director James Woolsey 
to the U.S. Congress, states that Iran most probably will be the 
first country to obtain the 1000-km-range 
North-Korean-manufactured "Nodong" missile, and that within six 
years it will be capable of manufacturing the "Scud-B" and 
"Scud-C" short-range missiles, in addition to the "Nodong" 
missile. 
<H5>  Defensive Measures </H5>
  In the face of the Iranian threat to control navigation in 
the waters of the Arab Gulf, Arab Gulf countries undertook 
effective defensive measures to counter the Iranian mines. The 
minesweeper deals concluded by three Gulf countries fall under 
this category. Also, the Gulf cruisers and fast missile boats 
are a practical response to the Iranian cruisers and boats. Gulf 
Cooperation Council countries enjoy close military cooperation, 
and in most of them there is in place an integrated air defense, 
monitoring and early warning system. The Saudi "Peace Shield" 
system operates during peacetime at the same level of total 
efficiency as did "Desert Storm" during wartime. Gulf countries 
enjoy greater material capabilities and capacity for defensive 
provisioning than does Iran. Thus, Iran's policy of 
"muscle-flexing" remains limited and indicative of 
short-sightedness. It would have been more advantageous for the 
rulers of Tehran to have directed oil revenues to investments 
and developmental causes for the benefit of their people than to 
have utilized them for the purchase of arms and the 
impoverishment of their citizens.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Algeria--Toward Civil War"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Eventually, as was to be expected, following 
the display rigged up in the name of "a conference for national 
consensus" the militarists usurped power by appointing the 
Algerian defense minister as the country's president. This 
proves that no political solution remains for the Algerian 
crisis. 
  Even though the military have long been the actual rulers 
behind the scenes in Algeria and are well aware of the situation 
in their society and of their impotence to quell the Islamic 
movement, they were forced to take this risk for their 
self-perpetuation in the crisis-ridden Algerian society. 
  It is interesting to note that the Algerian politicians were 
not prepared, as wisdom dictated, to accept any risks in order 
not to become toys in the hands of the military. It is evident 
that the military's success or failure will decide the future 
destiny of Algeria, and already the signs of defeat are obvious! 
  The Western countries--including France--have not welcomed 
the current situation and the lack of legitimacy at home, which 
is not even in conformity with the 1989 Algerian Constitution. 
This certainly does not bode well for the militarists' turn at 
the helm of government for the next three years. In order to 
keep their position they will be forced to resort to a military 
dictatorship and complete repression, and this will lead Algeria 
toward a full-fledged civil war in which the Muslims will enjoy 
political legitimacy and popular backing. [passage omitted] 
  In view of the continuing political crisis, which has been 
exacerbated by the concomitant economic crisis stemming from a 
reduction of oil prices, the military's usurpation of power in 
Algeria can be construed as "political suicide." Perhaps, since 
they do not believe in reconciliation with the Islamic movement 
and cannot accept peaceful coexistence with them, they are 
prepared to embark on this suicide! If the militarists had been 
on the side of the people, and had yielded to the popular will, 
they would not have darkened their own future as well as that of 
Algeria.

  [Text] Dubai--An Arab economic report says that for Arab 
world economies, 1993 was a year to further build on the 
positive developments that occurred in the region in 1992. 
Instead of burdening their economies with additional ambitious 
projects, countries of the region focussed instead on sustaining 
their previous year's accomplishments in the areas of confidence 
and investment. The optimism generated by the resolution of the 
Kuwait crisis in 1991 continued to prevail. The Arab states also 
reduced their borrowing and focussed on attracting international 
investors. The report added that 1993 brought with it more 
recognition of the need to administer economic conditions with a 
more reasoned and studied approach if they are to be sustained 
in the long-term. 
  The report, issued by the Arab Banking Corporation, pointed 
out that foreign economic developments greatly impacted the Arab 
world in 1993. Recession in Europe, which is the major market 
for Arab non-mineral exports, and the general softening of oil 
prices, contributed a measure of moderation to economic 
developments in the region. Other exporting countries, 
especially phosphates producers, suffered the consequences of 
reduced world demand. But the producers of minerals chose not to 
succumb to that negative actuality and, instead, adopted 
effective marketing strategies in their major markets, not 
merely to maintain market-shares but also to expand them. Those 
strategies were successful to a degree and are expected to 
remain in place beyond 1993, since several of those producer 
countries enjoy the lowest production costs in the world. 
  The report noted that future difficulties in 1994 will 
relate 
to maintaining the rate of investment at a time when returns are 
low on investments needed to expand the goods-producing sectors 
and supporting industries [as published] which have been 
considered important elements of the development strategies of 
Arab governments since the end of the Kuwait crisis. It pointed 
out that even though the Arab states, by offering a number of 
incentives, succeeded in 1991 in attracting private domestic and 
foreign investments to additional economic sectors, those states 
found it most difficult to attain their goals in the state-owned 
sectors that they place at the top of their priorities. 
  The Corporation noted that most of the states that suffered 
that predicament had enough borrowing power in 1993 to tap 
domestic and regional capital markets for the funds needed to 
finance their projects. Even though this was exactly what some 
of them did in 1991 and 1992, they chose to exercise that option 
as little as possible in 1993. [The Corporation] further stated 
in its report that, instead of borrowing, the countries 
concerned found it an easier strategy in the long run to 
concentrate their efforts on attracting international partners 
to major projects and on selling stock in other [enterprises]. 
Those strategies achieved a degree of success in 1993, but a 
number of countries faced the problem of raising enough domestic 
capital to equal the amounts obtained from foreign sources for 
the implementation of new development projects. 
  The Corporation said it was regrettable that Arab capital 
markets were lagging in development and that they did not become 
operational at the right time, especially that such markets will 
be an important source of minimum low-risk capital. It added 
that, although incomplete or undeveloped at present, many Arab 
capital markets did well in 1993, renewing confidence in the 
direction of local and regional economies amid expectations of 
future expansion. 
  The report revealed that, thanks to government-imposed 
financial controls, the Arab financial sector also enjoyed the 
benefit of expanding local economies due to several factors 
including low demand on that sector by public-sector 
enterprises. There was more freedom in a large number of 
countries in setting interest rates for deposits and loans. A 
reduction in interest rate controls was necessary to guarantee 
continued availability to the private sector of the additional 
funds offered by banks and others' financial institutions. But 
the aforementioned facilities were accompanied by extremely 
strict controls on banks concerning risk measurements in order 
to guarantee their compliance with international standards and 
to bolster the competitive positions of domestic institutions. 
  The report pointed out that the financial sectors in a 
number 
of countries have undergone changes introduced by radical reform 
programs, some of which have been in effect for years while the 
others were only recently introduced with support from the 
Privatization Fund, whose programs received a new push in 1993. 
  The agricultural sector, which has also benefitted from 
reform programs in recent years, remains a function of 
meteorological conditions. It managed adequate production in 
most of the Arab states, even though rainfall in certain areas 
was below their requirements. That sector's output, however, was 
not sufficient to change their agricultural trade deficits. 
  In order to lessen dependence on the weather, huge 
investments were necessarily maintained in irrigation and 
damming projects with support from regional and multi-national 
institutions. The tourism sector settled back in 1993 after 
sharp expansion in 1992. 
  The report added that conditions in certain Arab states 
remain desperate, having shown no sign of improvement year after 
year. Those countries, lacking any noteworthy developments in 
1993, continued to be recipients of Arab and international aid 
in order to keep them from further deterioration. Aid tied to 
projects or to trade with the rest of Arab countries, especially 
from individual Arab states and from development funds, was an 
important component of the investment programs implemented by 
those nations in 1993; as was the case with similar aid extended 
since the late 1970s.

  [Text] Bakr Mahmud Rasul, general manager of the Arab Labor 
Organization, warned of a threatening unemployment crisis in the 
Arab world. He said that the [unemployment] rate rose to 14 
percent last year and that there are 10 million unemployed 
workers, mostly in densely populated countries such as Egypt, 
Sudan, Morocco, and Algeria, but also in sparsely populated 
states such as Jordan. He further warned that the oil producers, 
even though they are sparsely populated, are also threatened by 
[unemployment] because of numerous programs for Asian 
immigrants and migrant workers. Bakr Rasul added that 
unemployment is most rampant among degreed recent entrants into 
the labor market, and said: "Some 2.5 million [workers] enter 
the Arab labor force annually with no chance of providing them 
with employment opportunities." 
  He said that economic reform programs in the Arab world may 
help correct the imbalances in domestic and external general 
balances and reduce the burden of debt, but they do not address 
unemployment. 
  Bakr Rasul pointed out that there are short, medium, and 
long-term solutions to unemployment problems and that the latter 
would depend on the success of existing economic reform programs 
and on making progress toward Arab cooperation based on mutual 
and entwined interests. He added that such Arab cooperation 
should be calculated, comprehensive, and rewarding to all 
parties, since it would also contribute to the success of reform 
programs that depend on export policies, broad market economies, 
expanded competition, and successful technological assimilation. 
He said that the Arab employment strategy, approved by the Arab 
states at last April's meeting of labor ministers, could be the 
means to resolve the unemployment crisis. 
  On the Organization's contributions to the success of the 
self-rule experiment in Gaza, Bakr Rasul said that "the Arab 
Labor Organization held an educational symposium last month for 
some 50 Palestinian union and labor leaders from the occupied 
territories. The meeting touched on all aspects of labor such as 
legislation, as well as laws and regulations dealing with social 
security, health security, shop safety, the work environment, 
labor unions and their role, labor education, and the right to 
organize. The forum also touched on the Palestinian economy and 
its components, unemployment in Palestine and how to deal with 
it, and the impetus for the Palestinian labor force and ways of 
stimulating it." He added that the meeting was worthwhile in 
that it enables Palestinian labor leaders to carry out their 
future responsibilities and help build the Palestinian state. 
  He said that the Arab Labor Organization's plan for 1994/95 
involves programmed activities as an initial step to benefit the 
parties to production in Palestine. He said that the 
Organization's specialized experts drafted a Palestinian labor 
law, which was submitted to Palestinian authorities for their 
review and comments before the Organization puts it in its final 
form. 
  Bakr Mahmud Rasul criticized the extent of Arab commitment 
to 
joint Arab labor agreements and said that "since its inception 
and until its last meeting in Amman last year, the Organization 
has been able to reach and ratify 14 Arab labor agreements 
dealing with such issues as transport of Arab labor, protection 
for women and minors, vocational training, labor culture, union 
freedoms, guarantees, and social security. Even though all these 
agreements underwent lengthy procedures, and even though they 
were passed unanimously with no reservations by any party, the 
rate of approval that would commit a state to an agreement 
remains low. Some Arab countries have ratified no Arab labor 
agreement at all. Other countries, even though they are founding 
members of the Organization, have ratified only one or two 
agreements. A third group of countries ratified the agreements, 
but took positions that proved contradictory to their 
provisions. He added that commitment to the agreements is a 
matter of moral, cultural, and national obligation. 
  Bakr Rasul said that the agenda of the upcoming Cairo 
session 
to be held early next April, involves discussion of the 
secretary general's report, in which he debates the subject of 
small industries and traditional crafts. This matter is of 
special interest because it is closely linked to the social and 
economic changes taking place in most of the Arab states as a 
result of economic restructuring that impacts employment and the 
war on unemployment as well as the optimum utilization of 
natural, technical, and human resources. Another important item 
on the upcoming meeting's agenda deals with economic reform 
programs and restructuring and their impact on labor issues. 
  The agenda also includes items on union freedoms and rights 
in the Arab nations and the ratification of the Arab plan of 
action at the 81st session of the International Labor Congress 
scheduled for Geneva next June.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Ferhat: "Sent to the Tizi Ouzou Prison Last </F>
July, Benhadj Is Transferred to the Blida Military 
Prison"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] After spending six months at the Tizi Ouzou prison, 
the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] number-two, Ali Benhadj, was 
returned to the Blida military prison. 
  He was sent to Blida prior to his trial in July 1992 and 
kept 
there for a while afterward, we learned from reliable sources. 
However, no information could be obtained as to the reasons of 
the transfer, which took place this week, a few days before the 
opening of the "National Dialogue Commission [NDC] Conference." 
Could there be a connection between this transfer and contacts 
with FIS leaders, announced and held in secrecy by the NDC? 
There is no indication that this is the case. But his return to 
the Blida military prison will enable Benhadj to join the other 
FIS leaders who were sentenced at the same time as he was: Kamel 
Guemazi, Ali Djeddi, Abdelkader Boukhamkham, Abdelkader Omar, 
and Nourredine Chigara. 
  As for Abassi Madani, according to indiscretions echoed in 
the press, he would be placed in an Algiers suburban residence. 
  Apart from that, we do not know if Benhadj's transfer has 
anything to do with his hunger strike of last December. This 
hunger strike, which was never officially acknowledged or 
denied, was announced by Rabah Kebir from Bonn, where he had 
taken refuge, in a press communique published by foreign press 
agencies. 
  The communique indicated that Benhadj wanted to protest 
"various measures taken against him," in particular "his 
transfer to the Tizi Ouzou prison where he was kept alone in a 
cell and no longer allowed to have visitors." We were unable to 
obtain the slightest information concerning the conditions under 
which the FIS number-two is held in prison. Concerning visits, 
however, we recall that Hachemi Sahnouni stated that he had paid 
a visit to Mr. Benhadj last 17 October. 
  On the other hand, his lawyers complained of some 
restrictions in this respect. But it would seem that these 
restrictions were motivated by the fact that Benhadj's defense 
lawyers were relaying his messages to the outside. 
  Our readers will also remember that one of his previous 
lawyers, Maitre Brahim Taouti, who had done just that, was 
sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Algiers Special 
Court last May. Maitre Taouti had smuggled out of the Blida 
military prison a document signed by Benhadj, in which the 
latter called for the death of civilian personalities, in 
particular Mr. Hafid Senhadri, a CNSA [National Committee for 
the Safeguarding of Algeria] founding member who was 
assassinated last March. In connection with that case, Benhadj 
was also supposed to be tried by a special court. But his trial, 
the date of which was never made public officially, has not 
taken place yet.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Nazim: "Ulemas and Duate Conference; Creation </F>
of the Republican Islamic Rally (RIR)"--first paragraph is 
LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] "To end `itna' and bloodshed among Algerians." 
  The participants who took turns speaking at the ulemas 
conference focused their speeches on this slogan. 
  Called last Thursday at the Harcha auditorium by seven 
Islamic personalities, including Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, the ulemas 
conference brought together several hundreds of people, in 
particular Algerian and foreign Islamic leaders. The 
participants took this opportunity to express their outrage at 
"the fratricidal fight among Algerians, assassination and 
threats against intellectuals, the worsening of the political 
situation, economic failure, and the rise of political and 
religious violence." 
  This situation prompted the ulemas to denounce "in righteous 
words, whatever is counter to divine order, with no fear of 
either the governing or the governed." 
  In this respect, the meeting gave the organizers an 
opportunity to announce the forthcoming creation of a Republican 
Islamic Rally, the TADJ [RIR]. 
  It would be a nonpartisan movement including all the ulemas 
and all the Algerians who might feel concerned by the appeal, 
even armed groups "provided they put down their weapons," Mr. 
Nahnah indicated. 
  "We want the TADJ to bring together all the ulemas, the 
preachers, the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], whether dissolved 
or not, En-Nahda [Awakening], the El Oumma (editor's note: 
league headed by Benyoucef Benkhedda), etc. 
  "All upright nationalists and all the Algerians who want to 
bar the way to those who cause trouble and divisions," he added. 
  At the close of the conference, Sheik Abou-Djara Soltani, 
professor at the Constantine Islamic University and conference 
spokesman, made it a point to clarify some issues raised by the 
organization of such a meeting. 
  Answering a question concerning the similarity [of the RIR] 
with Mr. Said Sadi's MPR [Movement for the Republic], Mr. 
Soltani bluntly stated that the RIR does not aspire "to any 
complementarity or normalization between Islamism and 
secularism"; the speaker even went so far as to state that the 
movement he is calling for "would oppose the MPR." 
  To those who wonder whether the time was well chosen to hold 
such a conference and create the RIR, Mr. Soltani said that the 
RIR does not claim to be a political formation and "has no 
ambition to take a direct part in the National Conference," 
although he did not rule out the possibility that the RIR might 
act as a mediator between the FIS and the government, should it 
be asked to do so. 
  In answering all these questions, Mr. Soltani insisted on 
the 
nonpartisan nature of his movement which, he said, will strive 
to fulfill the function which was initially assigned to the 
Dawla Islamiya [Islamic State] league but which the league could 
not fulfill "for reasons beyond its control or reasons of its 
own." At the end of his conference, Mr. Soltani announced a 
forthcoming RIR conference designed to examine questions 
concerning its organization and operation, and the eventual 
creation of a forum for reconciliation and the settlement of 
conflicts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tamanrasset: The Fight Against </F>
Smuggling Bears Fruit"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] (APS) -- Several types of items, the importation of 
which is illegal, and other staples intended for fraudulent 
exportation, worth over 6.3 billion centimes (fines included) 
were seized by the Tamanrasset regional customs directorate 
during 1993. 
  According to the report published recently by the customs 
authorities, seized imports consisted essentially of 
Marlboro-brand cigarettes, fabrics, cosmetics, and automotive 
spare parts. The products intended for export consisted of 
Lahda-brand milk and infant formula, sugar, semolina, pasta, 
household soap, table oil, and fuel. 
  In this respect, although their resources are very limited, 
the customs were able to recover in 1993 large quantities of 
price-supported staples that would have been fraudulently 
exported to neighboring countries (Mali and Niger). They 
included, among other things, 10,888 cartons of Lahda milk and 
infant formula, 25 tons of pasta, 26 tons of semolina and flour, 
3.5 tons of sugar, 5,018 cakes of household soap, 2,700 liters 
of table oil, 1.5 tons of rice, and 1,970 liters of gasoline. 
  In addition, 222,450 packs of Marlboro cigarettes, 12,068 
meters of fabric, 16,450 cosmetic items, 1,855 automotive spare 
parts, and 20,000 electric bulbs, which were smuggled into the 
country to be sold on the domestic market, were seized in border 
zones. As a result of the seizure of these goods, 527 cases were 
investigated by the judicial authorities, the report indicated. 
However, according to the Tamanrasset regional director, Mr. 
Abdelkader Atmouni, 1993 saw a marked decrease in the volume of 
seized goods and the number of cases, compared with 1992. 
  This is because of increased crime and insecurity in the 
region, which deterred smugglers, in addition to the closing of 
the border with Niger, he said. In this context, we should also 
mention a considerable decrease in population movements through 
border posts. 
  Thus, there were 3,431 exits and 2,556 entries through the 
border posts of In-Guezzam and Tin-Zaouatine. These travelers 
are essentially inhabitants of border regions. 
  As far as barter is concerned, the Tamanrasset customs 
authorities noted a marked increase in trade among Algerians, 
Malians, and Nigeriens. They thus reported that over 5.7 billion 
centimes' worth of goods were imported from Niger and Mali, 
while 4.2 billion centimes' worth of Algerian goods were 
exported to these countries. 
  These figures denote a rather strong export/import imbalance 
which, according to customs authorities, is due to the 
unavailability of Algerian products for export, especially those 
that are in very great demand in neighboring countries, such as 
plastic items and blankets (the exportation of which is 
authorized). 
  We should stress that, since its creation last May, the new 
Algerian customs general directorate has undertaken another 
territorial reorganization. As a result, the Tamanrasset customs 
regional directorate now consists of three district 
inspectorates (Tamanrasset, In-Guezzam, and Bordj Babji-Mokhtar). 
  The latter two were promoted to inspectorates. In addition, 
following the last visit of the Algerian customs general 
director to border posts in the Algerian far south, measures 
were taken to redeploy customs personnel, appreciably improve 
agents' working and living conditions, and provide more material 
resources. The objective was to make it possible to bring 
smuggling under control and fight fraud so as to halt the 
sapping of Algeria's economy.

  Note, however, that Mr. Brahiti stressed the provisional 
nature of this figure. Thus, 1993 inflation was estimated on the 
basis of incomplete data supplied by the National Statistics 
Office and the National Plan Committee. This 20-percent 
inflation rate should be compared with the 32 percent officially 
reported in 1992. 
  As for the current year, Mr. Brahiti stated that inflation 
is 
expected to run to 25 percent. Thus, in current dinars[DA], a 
strong increase of the gross domestic product [GDP] is expected 
in 1994 (DA1,300 billion compared with DA1,089 billion in 1993), 
whereas in constant dinars (taking inflation into account) we 
have stagnation. 
  Still in 1994, public expenditures (DA535.3 billion) will 
increase by 11.1 percent, "i.e., at a rate much slower than the 
expected inflation." Public revenues, for their part, will 
amount to DA410 billion. According to the minister-delegate to 
the budget, the budget deficit of DA125.3 billion represents 
"9.6 percent of the GDP, or 3.8 percent if we exclude the 
business reorganization fund." 
  "This deficit, which is much lower than the 1993 deficit," 
Mr. Brahiti said, "must be assessed in relation to the State 
efforts, in particular for price and income support and business 
financial reorganization, as these efforts alone will continue 
to account for close to DA118 billion, i.e., 94 percent of the 
deficit."

<F P=106> [Article by A. Tahraoui: "Urban Transportation; Curse the </F>
Bus"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Taking a bus in Algiers these days is no picnic. 
  The considerable number of buses placed at the disposal of 
citizens has not changed one whit the time-honored struggle the 
unfortunate Algerian must face every day. He has no choice; his 
professional and family life are conditioned by this ill of 
modern times: transportation. Well, then, to bus or not to bus? 
The adventure begins in the morning, on the way to work, to end 
only in the evening. How many of us do not have to pay their 
daily tribute in time, cutting down on sleep or work in order to 
catch a bus? How many of us do not have to put up with, or 
practice the "delightful" sport, which consists in elbowing 
one's way through the crowd to board a bus? Very few I should 
say. After standing about for minutes or even hours in an agony 
of impatience, the fateful moment finally comes, "his majesty" 
the bus is among us. Clear the decks! Without any warning, the 
"holy war" starts. Pushing, shouting, cursing, shoving. 
Everything goes. Here, an old woman is trampled underfoot; 
there, another one is "attacked." You wouldn't believe your eyes 
or your ears. To force their way to the bus door, the shrewder 
ones take the offensive, launching successive "raids" 
interspersed with shoulder knocks that could send you flying 
across the street. The "peaceful" ones choose to look on, 
waiting for any "ceasefire." That's a mistake. Attacks follow in 
close succession, ending only when the bus is moving. Once 
inside, "hostilities" subside. Eventually, there is a truce. The 
heat inside certainly helps. The bus is crammed full. It takes 
luck to find a seat, or even standing room in a less crowded 
corner, away from nauseating odors. A deathly hush prevails, 
interrupted now and then by the conductor, cursing this or that. 
Whew! Finally, we reach the terminal and our anxiety is 
relieved. We fight to get out as we fought to get in...rushing 
to freedom. The honorable ETUSA [the urban transportation board] 
must be thinking of a nuisance bonus, plus a medal of valor for 
anyone who does not crack up in these accursed buses.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Feb (MENA)--Shaykh Hasan al-Hallawi, an 
al-Azhar scholar, has confirmed that issuing death threats and 
killing peaceful citizens and innocent foreigners are matters 
not approved by Islamic law but are a distortion of 
jurisprudence and religion and a wrong interpretation of the 
Shar'iah. 
  On behalf of detained Islamic Action leaders, he issued an 
appeal today to youths of the Islamic Groups [al-jama'at 
al-islamiyah] urging them to make the month of Ramadan a 
starting point for discarding violence and aggression and for 
opening a constructive dialogue because it is the course 
accepted by wise people, because there is an atmosphere of 
freedom, justice, and security, and because the side that is 
afraid of dialogue has a weak argument. 
  Concluding his appeal to the Islamic Groups youths, Shaykh 
al-Hallawi said: Fear God, abandon this sedition, and listen to 
the counsel of the trustworthy scholars.

<F P=106> Interview with Dr. Mamduh Ahmad al-Biltaji, minister of </F>
tourism and civil aviation by Sa'id Shilsh; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Dr. al-Biltaji explains the 
tourism crisis, his view of privatization in the tourism sector, 
the effect of terrorist incidents on investment in tourism, the 
new tourism promotion plan, and the way to encourage Egyptian 
tourism. 
  With the mentality of a PhD-level economist and a 
businessman 
who served as an information attache and the head of the 
Information Authority for 16 years during which he circled the 
globe, and with the objectivity for which he is known, Dr. 
al-Biltaji granted the following interview regarding tourism and 
tourism plans as we enter the new year. 
  [Shilsh] What is the total extent of the losses suffered by 
Egypt due to terrorism incidents? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Terrorist incidents have deepened the tourism 
crisis in Egypt. The number of tourists dropped from 3.2 million 
in 1992 to 2.2 million in 1993. The number of tourism nights 
fell from 20.5 million in 1992 to 13.7 million in 1993. Tourism 
revenues fell from $2.3 billion in 1992 to $1.1 billion in 1993. 
  [Shilsh] The tourism sector is now being privatized. What is 
your view on this subject and the extent of its effect on 
Egyptian tourism? 
  [Al-Biltaji] I believe that the policy of encouraging the 
private sector is a successful policy, and I intend to reinforce 
it. However, I believe that any sales must be subject to market 
mechanisms. I do not agree with the sale of all of the hotels at 
one time, because such a sale would be incompatible with market 
mechanisms. The sale must be subject to market mechanisms. This 
requires expansion of the ownership base and avoidance of a 
glut, because a glut would result in unrealistic development. 
Most countries that have attempted privatization began 
gradually, because flooding the market is not a sound policy. 
  [Shilsh] President Mubarak has recently devoted great 
attention to the tourism problem. He went personally to tourism 
areas following terrorist incidents against tourists that 
occurred in early 1993. What place does the tourism problem 
occupy in President Mubarak's mind? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Tourism is a major concern of President 
Mubarak. 
His going to the tourism areas gave a big boost to investors and 
employees in the tourism sector. Republic Decree No. 445 of 
1991, which pertains to support of tourist attractions and the 
Tourism Development Authority, has had a major effect in 
boosting investment activity in tourist areas. 
  [Shilsh] Have the recent terrorist incidents affected 
tourist 
investment activity? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Some effect has undoubtedly occurred. However, 
investments have begun to return. The amount spent on 
investments in the tourist sector from 1981 to 1991 totalled 6.4 
billion Egyptian pounds, of which the private sector accounted 
for 89 percent and Egyptian investments accounted for 54 percent. 
  The facilities provided by the state to investors have 
played 
a major role in encouraging investment activity, because 
investment in the tourist sector yields a quick return and 
enjoys a large number of tax exemptions. 
  [Shilsh] Some believe that the tourism crisis entails many 
factors, not just terrorist incidents and the Gulf war. What is 
your opinion? 
  [Al-Biltaji] I believe that the tourism crisis is structural 
and goes back to before the Gulf crisis and the terrorist 
incidents. The tourism crisis is structural. It is not a 
temporary disruption. What is happening is that the volume of 
tourism to Egypt is very low. It reached a peak in 1992, but 
Egypt's tourism revenues nonetheless reached the peak of 
despair. This volume (3.2 million tourists) represents only 0.64 
percent of the volume of world tourism. I attribute this to the 
fact that the collective consciousness, investors, the private 
sector, and the media--because of its legacy--have not realized 
the importance of tourism as a new industry. Also, while the 
supply has increased, demand has not increased, because we have 
not applied the principles of sound promotion, as other 
countries are doing. How much do you imagine the countries of 
the world allocate to promote tourism? They spent from 1 to 2 
percent of all tourism revenue for this purpose. We in Egypt 
have spent only $3 million, even though our income from tourism 
was $2.3 billion according to Central Bank estimates. If we 
subtract the time of the crisis and take 2 percent of tourism 
revenues as an average allocation, we should have spent $23 
million on promotion. If we look at what other countries have 
allocated for promotion, we find the following: Morocco, $21.3 
million annually; Turkey, $27.5 million; Greece, $15 million; 
Cyprus, $7.3 million; and France, 71.8 million. 
  [Shilsh] What then is the solution? How can you come up with 
the sums needed to promote tourism? 
  [Al-Biltaji] The solution is through the private tourism 
sector, the public treasury, and the Tourism Fund. 
  [Shilsh] Marketing requires a strong plan to yield rapid 
results. 
  [Al-Biltaji] A plan exists. It consists of invitations to 
visit Egypt, which have been extended to the key travel 
organizations, tourism companies, and the tourism trade media, 
as well as extensive public relations, because our problem is a 
lack of information. 
  [Shilsh] Who is managing the marketing campaign? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Let us begin with the traditional management, 
namely the 16 tourism promotion offices. We are now preparing a 
new plan to restructure these offices and to establish new 
offices near tourist attractions. The private sector also has a 
responsibility for making promotional efforts, and public 
relations firms should contract directly with foreign producers 
of information resources. [passage omitted] 
  [Shilsh] As 1994 begins, what is your view of the 
development 
of the tourism promotion program and the promotion of Egyptian 
tourism? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Our efforts consist of: promotional activity 
abroad based on a carefully thought-out professional plan to 
increase the demand for Egyptian tourism; the pursuit of an 
integrated tourism investment and development policy designed to 
increase the supply consistent with aspirations regarding a 
tourism revival in the future; the diversification of the 
Egyptian tourism product by arranging a series of regularly 
recurring cultural, musical, religious, archeological events 
throughout Egypt's key tourism governorates; efforts to promote 
these events as additional attractions; and the mounting of an 
intensive campaign to enhance domestic awareness of the 
importance of tourism as a source of jobs and income for the 
millions of Egyptians working in sectors related to tourism 
directly or indirectly. 
  [Shilsh] What can be added to current tourism promotion 
techniques and efforts? 
  [Al-Biltaji] Much can be added. For example, the creation of 
a calendar of annual festivals on the anniversaries of 
archeological finds of international interest, held at the site 
of the find; the creation of a calendar of musical festivals 
organized for tourism purposes; the creation of a calendar of 
different religious events; the creation of a calendar of 
athletic competitions, such as hunting competitions, car races, 
and yacht races; the organization of an international festival 
of Pharaonic sports; an allocation for important artistic and 
cultural sites and events held over the course of the year; an 
allocation for exhibitions of Egyptian agricultural and 
industrial products; an attempt to establish the dates of these 
exhibitions and to expand their scope so that they become an 
added tourist attraction; the organization of a yearly crafts 
fair in Egypt; the organization of a celebration of folk arts, 
perhaps at tourist sites in Upper Egypt, during which festivals 
of Egyptian folk songs, music, and dress would be held.

<F P=106> [Article by Yo'el Marcus] </F>
  [Text] This is the first time that a government's military 
procurement decision has been accompanied by such open publicity 
about specific targets and objectives. Reports about the 
selection of the F-15I made banner headlines in most of the 
Israeli media as "the plane that can fly to Iran and back 
without refueling." If they had just wanted to tout the virtues 
of the plane and justify its astronomical price (more than $100 
million per aircraft), they could have noted that it has the 
range to reach London and Moscow. Most likely, however, neither 
the British nor the Russians would have appreciated Israel's 
pointed gesture. 
  All the more so, indications that Iran is the target of the 
F-15I are neither unappreciated nor taken as a joke in Tehran. 
If I were Iran's chief of staff, I would see the headlines 
coming out of Israel, and the fact that they emanate from 
Israel's top brass, as a serious military threat. The ability of 
the F-15 to reach Iran without refueling reduces the value of 
continuous operations there. So, if I were the Iranian chief of 
staff, I would pay attention to the timing of the publication of 
a book on Israel's nuclear might and conclude that these planes 
are intended for nothing other than to be the means of 
delivering nuclear weapons. This threat, which we have gone to 
such lengths to make public, provides Iran a legitimate reason 
for taking drastic "defensive measures" and arming itself with a 
deterrent. Is that what was intended when we specified the 
target? 
  Israel this week named Iran as our foremost enemy in the 
future. The troubling question is, how do we reach such fateful 
decisions? Who decides, and how and where is it decided, who is 
Israel's future enemy? Did the general staff come to this 
decision after probing discussion? I doubt that. Indeed, both 
the chief of staff and the chief of Army Intelligence last year 
refused to identify Iran as the enemy. Did the government sit in 
one of its famous marathon sessions and decide that it needs to 
prepare for war against Iran? To the best of my information, no 
real decision of that nature was made. So who has decided who 
the enemy is? 
  Yitzhaq Rabin's initial comments regarding Iran were made in 
the Knesset on 20 January 1993, in answer to a question posed by 
Knesset member Efra'im Sheh. Rabin said then that: "We are 
following with concern Iran's nuclear activities and its 
attempts to develop a long-range ground-to-ground missile." The 
practical conclusion he expressed then was that: "We must speed 
up the peace process and create an international system that 
provides an answer to the Iranian threat." 
  Over the past year, Rabin frequently has stated his concern 
about the Iranian threat. The administration's decision to make 
the advanced technologies of the F-15 available to Israel surely 
comes from Clinton's appreciation of Israel's fears about Iran. 
  Sneh, who has led in sounding the alarm against the Iranian 
threat, both in Israel and in mobilizing world public opinion, 
does not believe that 20 F-15I aircraft are the answer to the 
Khumeyni ideology. In fact, we have not yet found a military 
answer to the danger of what Rabin has called "Khomeynism 
without Khomeyni." The only thing we have done, not without a 
little success, has been to arouse international attention and 
to point out that a missile that can reach Israel also can reach 
Riyadh, Tokyo and New Delhi, a fact that explains American 
pressure on North Korea not to sell long-range missiles to Iran. 
  Iran potentially is a future strategic threat to Israel. As 
a 
matter of priorities, however, Israel does not head Iran's list 
of strategic targets. Iran is working at this stage on three 
tracks: 1) systematic exploitation of oil exports; 2) 
undermining the current Arab regimes--Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, 
Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and, of course, subordination 
of the Palestinian entity through Hamas; and 3) the final goal, 
which is to marshal the 900 million Muslims of the world into 
its service under a single theological roof. 
  In the long term, if Iran realizes its dream of building a 
Khomeynian empire in all the Muslim nations, from Algeria to 
Turkmenistan, Israel would have good reason for concern. But by 
identifying it now as an enemy target, we force Iran to move 
Israel to the top of its list of objectives. By making clear 
that we are receiving "an airplane that can reach Iran and 
return without refueling," we are showing off more than we are 
showing wisdom.

<F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>
  [Text] Three Americans, including Admiral William Crowe, a 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who now serves as 
unofficial adviser to President Clinton, and McGeorge Bundy, 
former national security adviser to two presidents, are calling 
for recognition of Israel, India, and Pakistan as nuclear states 
if they agree to announce that they possess nuclear weapons. 
According to the proposal's proponents, such an announcement 
would enable the three states to be more moderate, less 
threatening and more careful in the future. 
  This proposal appears in a book published by the Foreign 
Relations Council and authored by Admiral Crowe, Bundy, and a 
physicist, Cindy Drill. The book, which deals with lowering 
nuclear threats, contains a chapter on Israel, India, and 
Pakistan. This is the first time that such a proposal has been 
made in print by people with their background in security. 
Although they do not hold official position in the Clinton 
Administration, the three, and especially Crowe, are close to 
the government's highest levels. 
  The authors state that such recognition would require 
amendment of the international agreement on nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons so the three states can become parties to it. 
Israel, Pakistan, and India are not signatories to the 
nonproliferation treaty, which identifies as nuclear states only 
those countries that conducted atomic testing before 1967. The 
treaty is scheduled to be updated, apparently by amendment, in 
1995. 
  In addressing this issue, the authors state that Israel, 
India, and Pakistan are, in effect, "undeclared nuclear states," 
and contend that Israel definitely possesses sizable holdings of 
nuclear warheads. By their estimate, India possesses the 
know-how and materials required for rapid production of nuclear 
warheads whenever it wants. Pakistan's situation resembles 
India's, although at a lower level. The authors believe that 
when neighboring states contend that these three are nuclear 
nations, the charge is true. 
  Israel is said to engage in a deceptive and hypocritical 
nuclear policy. According to the authors, Israel argues that 
secrecy causes its neighbors less worry, but it also does not 
want to worry its friends, particularly the United States, by 
stating that it has nuclear weapons. This position has 
increasingly led to difficulties, so that many reject it as 
absurd and even aggressive. 
  The authors believe that the three nations are hurt 
politically by their claim that they do not possess nuclear 
weapons and that each of them is paying a heavy political price 
for it. Israel, as a result, finds it difficult to explain that 
its neighbors have nothing to fear from its nuclear weapons 
unless they seek to destroy her. The authors state that in the 
current situation, in which people shut their eyes to Israel's 
nuclear arsenal, talks on limiting nuclear weapons in the Middle 
East are meaningless. 
  In the authors' view, Israel, India, and Pakistan desired 
nuclear weapons for compelling defensive reasons, whether to 
deter enemies or to repel major invasions of their lands. One 
can debate the gravity of this threat, but their neighbors must 
consider that each of the three, and each one on the way, sees 
nuclear arms as defensive weapons. The fact that the three 
nations guard their nuclear weapons in secrecy indicates a 
degree of moderation. It is certainly true that the nuclear arms 
in their possession do not represent a threat of aggression. If 
they now reveal openness, it will be possible to deal with them 
in a realistic way rather than as though they do not exist. Like 
the five big nuclear states, India, Israel and Pakistan will be 
able to display a large measure of moderation. 
  As for Israel, the authors say that if the United States 
were 
to announce that it regards Israel as nuclear state, that would 
place the situation in a realistic light and undoubtedly make it 
easier for Israel to tell the truth. The problem is that 
governments do not like it when other nations give away their 
secrets, and certainly not nuclear ones. Thus, the best way out 
of the thicket, in their opinion, would be an independent 
Israeli decision to declare that it has nuclear weapons. 
  Official Israeli sources queried about the proposal said 
that 
although it has some interesting and positive features, it 
clearly is also fraught with possibilities for enormous 
political complications.

<F P=106> [Article by Hayim Fiqarsh] </F>
  [Text] With each side seeking to impose its position, 
management and the employees of Israeli Aircraft Industries 
[IAI] have quarreled for months on end over how to carry out the 
recovery plan. Rounds of talks between the sides have been 
accompanied by angry demonstrations by workers and, at times, by 
outbreaks of violence in which employees vented their rage on 
factory machinery and management offices. The moment of truth, 
however, has arrived--and IAI's recovery plan, which was 
submitted yesterday for the government's approval, is going into 
effect. 
  In practical terms, the plan means dismissal of 2,900 
workers 
at a cost to the government of more than $400 million. The 
workers' committees, as well as the Histadrut, have now given 
their consent to the plan, a "verdict" that some of those 
subject to dismissal do not accept. Not in vain did candidates 
for layoffs recently hold a number of demonstrations against 
members of the committees, but it seems that everyone has become 
reconciled to the need for dismissals to give IAI's recovery 
plan a chance. 
  The recovery plan was hammered out jointly by the 
government, 
IAI's management, the Histadrut, and the workers themselves. It 
went into effect with the Histadrut's signing of the agreement 
last weekend. The key clauses of the plan provide for worker 
layoffs with limited compensation to be paid by Mavtakhim, the 
Histadrut's insurance company. 
  As if the sweeping dismissals were not enough, the workers 
have stated their willingness to take pay cuts of 15 percent by 
giving up the salary raises and cost of living increases that 
every Israeli employee is to receive this year. Another clause, 
which is considered essential to the recovery plan, grants IAI's 
management greater authority to transfer workers according to 
production needs among the various factories as they arise. This 
employee transfer clause was one of the main sticking points 
during the contacts and negotiations between the sides. 
  People are now wondering whether the plan will save Israel's 
aircraft industry or give it some breathing room in the 
continuing world crisis that is putting red ink on the account 
books of most of the world's aircraft corporations. The threat 
presented by the crisis still hangs over IAI's skies. The 
industry's good times lie in the past; those days, when more 
than 24,000 workers were employed, will not return. The workers, 
too, know that; that is why they are willing to give up some of 
their take-home pay. More than a few of the workers who were 
destined to receive pink slips have already left the country, 
many of settling in South Africa or America's Silicon Valley. 
Others, who still have years to go before they can leave on 
pension, have taken early retirement on the promise of modest 
compensation. Yet there exists among the workers laid-off a 
segment that does not want to accept the judgment; it is a good 
bet that the "workshop quiet" will be shattered. As a general 
matter, however, the recovery plan for this major industry is 
becoming a concrete fact on the hope that IAI will learn to get 
back on its feet, and even open its doors to new markets, or 
adopt modern work techniques with new market shares both here 
and abroad. 
  The success of IAI's recovery plan is of major importance 
for 
other Israeli businesses, including the military industry, that 
have sunk into crisis. As the upheaval in them persists, more 
than a few of those leading the fight for employees seek to rely 
on facets of IAI's recovery plan. Even so, the government has 
poured in more than 800 million shekels in recent months, to 
make possible the dismissals of close to 2,500 workers even 
within such a framework. Now it is arranging for the release of 
still another 300 workers and even the shutdown of an additional 
two or three "unprofitable" installations. 
  There is concern at military plants, too, over an unclear 
future. In the past, Israel could take real pride in its 
military factories, which employed more than 18,000 workers; 
today, that number is estimated at just 5,000. The military 
recovery plan also included testing production lines for the 
civilian market as well as shifting plants in the center of the 
country to regions of the Negev. That idea made sense, because 
the explosions occurring in those installations endangered 
residential areas; the compensation that had to be paid for 
damages to homes and businesses could have sped up the 
transition to the Negev. Finance Minister Avraham "Beiga" Shohat 
now insists that these plants must not be moved because the 
costs involved amount to more than 300 million shekels. 
  Overall, production cutbacks in military plants are placing 
their economic future in doubt. A business such as Rafa'el, 
which is in a crisis, also raises grave concerns regarding 
Israel's future security because of further reductions in arms 
production. It looks like the government will not be able to 
evade this problem; it will soon have to give its attention to 
the future of these installations, perhaps on the basis of IAI's 
recovery plan.

<F P=106> [Article by Marit Gilat] </F>
  [Text] Prizma, a new dye factory run by Koor's subsidy 
Makhteshim, began operation last week. Koor described the 
venture as part of its strategic diversification designed to 
broaden the company's basket of products. 
  Much has been said of the recovery plan, by which Koor's 
creditor banks have forced it to sell its controlling interest 
in Tambor at a price far below its current worth. Koor's renewed 
entry into the Israeli dye industry is intended to break 
Tambor's monopoly over 80 percent of the local market. 
  There is more than meets the eye in this script. Koor may 
have sold its direct interest in Tambor but it continues to hold 
half the shares of Mashav, which owns 24 percent of Tambor's 
shares. At the end of this chain, Koor has 12 percent of 
Tambor's shares. The opening of a rival dye company does not 
mesh with its interests as a part owner. 
  It seems reasonable to conclude that Koor was unwillingly 
drawn into the venture by Makhteshim even though Makhteshim's 
CEO is Yehuda Milo, Koor's deputy CEO. 
  "Koor controls lines that are fundamentally independent," a 
member of Koor's board of directors explained this week. "Not 
everything is set from above. A subsystem can identify a 
business opportunity in a field that runs against Koor's 
interests, the management team brings the proposal to the 
company's board of directors and the board then decides. The 
chairman of the board does not make the decision himself." 
  The dye company is just one example of a symptom inherent in 
Koor's strategy of diversification--its fluid assets are not 
within the company itself. Koor's latest financial report shows 
a considerable improvement in its fluidity, amounting to working 
capital of 724 million shekels at the end of September, 1993. 
  The financial reports for the first seven months of this 
year, however, are combined reports. Koor admits that most of 
its fluid assets were drained in satisfying its debts to Israeli 
and foreign banks. 
  The company's current fluid holdings are in its 
subsidiaries, 
primarily Nesher and Tadiran. The Prizma project is proof that 
under current conditions, Koor does not have absolute control 
over its lines of investment or their nature. 
  On the other hand, Koor will have no difficulty finding 
funds 
to finance its diversification program on its own. Because it is 
not leveraged at present, it enjoys a wide field for acquiring 
funds. Indeed, it expects to raise close to 120 million shekels 
in convertible bonds, which it will use carrying out its 
five-year strategic plan. 
  Koor must expand in order to preserve its returns on 
capital. 
The high profits of 1992-1993 led to a sharp increase in its 
shareholder equity. Accordingly, it must expand its sources of 
income and, above all, diversify them. 
  The company's recovery plan was essentially a consolidation 
plan by which Koor sold dozens of concerns. The reduction 
brought it back to profitability but also made it highly 
dependent on three sources of income: Tadiran and Telrad, 
Nesher, and Makhteshim and Agan. 
  Tadiran alone accounted for one-third of Koor's profits in 
1993. Along with Telrad, its dependence on the communications 
branch is very high. 
  This dependence is particularly problematic in light of 
Tadiran's own deep roots in Bezeq, which is suffering from 
steadily lower prices; it also is having difficulties making the 
transition from the local market to exports and from a slice of 
the military market to the civilian one. 
  Its opportunities in cellular phones also have plunged since 
GTE withdrew from competition. If it does not find a new 
partner, it too will have to drop out. 
  Koor's success in 1994 will depend on its success in 
steering 
Tadiran through an obstacle course. That, apparently, is the 
reason that Koor's CEO, Benny Ga'on, recently appointed himself 
chairman of Tadiran. 
  The goal that Koor has established for itself in the 
strategic plan is to reach annual sales of $3 billion by 1997, 
$1 billion from exports. The strategic plan is based on an 
economic survey the company made that identified two critical 
fields with potential--the tourist industry in peacetime and the 
capital market. As for tourism, Koor has announced its intention 
to go into four areas: hotels, car rental, travel agencies, and 
holiday parks. As for the stock market, Koor's managers are 
talking about opening or buying a brokerage house. 
  In fact, market analysts say, Koor has already begun making 
vast acquisitions. "There is practically no company trading on 
the market that has not passed over Koor's desk," is the way a 
senior figure at a competitor puts it. "As a general matter, it 
looks like the company is buying almost everything available, 
and at high prices." 
  Despite a superficial resemblance to the Koor of prerecovery 
plan days, this is not a return to the mold that brought it down 
back then. In the 1980's, Koor bought anything at hand, 
including highly leveraged, money-losing businesses without 
knowing what was going on inside them. Its motives were partly 
political, and the interlocking debts among the companies 
dragged the whole system into bankruptcy. 
  Today, the companies do not owe debts to one another. Each 
profit center is autonomous, so a loss in one company will not 
topple the entire house of cards. But the prices at which Koor 
has been making its acquisitions, critics contend, are liable to 
become problems in the future. 
  'Ami Goldene, managing director of Me'ir 'Ezra, which is 
competing with Koor for acquisition of Milutal, a frozen 
vegetables business, has assailed Koor for the high price it 
offered for the business. Goldene may have an ax to grind, but 
the capital market provides other examples. Along with Klal, 
Koor bought Yuli 'Ofer's holdings in Carmel Granites at market 
prices. 
  Of the acquisition of 15 percent of Arki'a, one market 
analyst says, a company like Koor has no reason to invest in a 
business without taking control of it. "You have to remember 
that the moment that Eilat has 6,000 hotel rooms, another 
carrier will be able to enter that route. Arki'a will lose its 
monopoly and be forced to cut fares," says the analyst. 
  The purchase of the Kinorot Tiberias hotel has also drawn 
criticism. "If Koor wants to enjoy the peace dividend, it has to 
build hotels rather than buy them. When you buy a hotel today, 
the price already reflects the expected dividend," says the 
analyst. 
  Koor is used to giving reasons in its defense. Koor's CEO, 
Benny Ga'on, refused to be interviewed for this article, but 
other company officials stressed that the best evidence of 
Koor's caution is the long list of companies that it 
contacted--and turned down. A random and unrepresentative 
sampling of the list includes Tempo, Sahar, Moritz-Tukhlar, Dan 
Rent-A-Car and Histour. 
  "There is a lot of noise surrounding Koor, a sense that it 
has a hand in everything. Koor is thought of as a company that 
brings financial and organizational skills. We get business 
offers every day," says a Koor official, "but we turn away most 
of them. If you look at where we have actually put our money, 
you see that the company has been very selective." 
  According to this official, once Koor achieves the goals it 
has set itself, it will stop the entire process. "You can expect 
that we will quit running after opportunities at a certain 
point." 
  With the exception--surprisingly--of Milutal, the officer 
completely rejects complaints about specific investments. "The 
deal still is not done and nothing is definite," says the 
official. "The frozen vegetable market is highly saturated and 
we have a lot of questions. It will depend on the numbers the 
other side shows us." As for the other investments, adds the 
official, all considerations were taken into account at the time 
of acquisition. 
  "How can you say that we bought Arki'a at market prices when 
the deal was done the night the shares were issued? On paper, 
we've made 25 million shekels since the sale, a half million 
sheqels a day," says the Koor official. 
  Someone else, outside the company, also rejects the 
criticism. "Two years ago, Koor was deep in the recovery plan 
and not in a position to buy anything. What IDB [Israel Discount 
Bank] got quietly during those two years, Koor is now doing all 
at once and very noisily," says the CEO of one of the economy's 
leading corporations. 
  "They said prices on the market were high two years ago, 
too, 
and it later turned out that anyone who did not buy then lost 
out, and big. It is true that Koor is now buying at market 
prices and multipliers of 25 and 30, when many companies are 
being sold above their value. The problem is not companies that 
are sold on the stock market but those not on the market. But 
you have to remember that even Koor itself is acquiring ever 
higher multipliers, so it is difficult to say definitely whether 
it is buying at exceptionally dear prices," says the CEO. 
  If one can judge by Koor's publicly traded stock, the market 
still has not decided. Its shares sell now for the same price 
they did six months ago, far below the overall share index. Some 
attribute that to the volume of trades that the government set 
in motion on the market. Others see it as a vote of no 
confidence in the strategic plan. 
  Three directors have resigned from Koor's board over the 
past 
half year. Some have tried to link the wave of departures with a 
feeling of uneasiness arising from developments in the company. 
The three members involved categorically deny that and claim 
that they resigned because of conflicts of interest. Accountant 
Ariela Zukhobitzky preferred the stock market's board of 
directors. Minister Shalom Shiran says that Koor's entry into 
the world of stock portfolios made him fearful of conflicts of 
interests because he serves as adviser to a number of companies 
in the field. "If I would had any complaints, I would have made 
them known," contends Shiran. 
  Shmu'el Rotem, of Nayar Hadera, says that he decided to 
resign after he was asked to serve as director on behalf of the 
public; there was some overlap between the operations of Argaz 
and those of Markavim, which is a subsidiary of Koor. Rotem cut 
to the heart of the matter in a single sentence: "Koor's 
directors and management have to guard against euphoria and keep 
a sense of proportion in their decisions and activities." 
  People close to the company today speak out more pointedly 
when the word "euphoria" goes around. "Some acquisitions were 
worth getting, some not. Some things might have been bought more 
cheaply," said one person close to the company. 
  "It is natural that a sense of euphoria has developed in 
Koor," says one member of the board of directors. "It is no 
wonder that that is happening in a company that was mired so 
deeply in the mud and got out thanks to good management. 
Undoubtedly there are people on the leadership teams who have 
said the same thing." 
  Benny Ga'on, say those close to Koor, wields almost total 
control over the company. Partly, that is a matter of his 
charismatic personality and the status he can claim as the man 
responsible for the company's revival. But the deeper reason is 
that Koor has no owners in the true sense of the word, and in 
the absence of owners, one member of the board explained, 
management becomes whatever it can. 
  Koor bore the yoke of the bank arrangement until a year ago. 
When it was freed of the arrangement, Hevrat Ha'ovdim, which now 
holds 37 percent of Koor's shares, was supposed to step back in 
and take on the role of owner. Since the collapse of the 
Histadrut's own companies, however, this body has been emptied 
of much of its substance. If Hevrat Ha'ovdim is now regaining 
its strength, that is due to its possession of Koor, and not the 
reverse. Prof. Eytan Sheshinsky, chairman of Koor's board of 
directors and a dominant figure in his own right, was formally 
appointed by Hevrat Ha'ovdim. But as an active partner in the 
recovery process, Sheshinsky was identified more with management 
than with the shareholders. 
  In any event, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's control over Koor is 
temporary. In the meantime, Bank Hapo'alim is the sole body that 
has exercised the options it received as part of the Koor 
arrangement in return for wiping out it debts. The bank has held 
23.9 percent of the company's shares since August, 1993. When 
the other banks, foremost among them Bank Le'umi, exercise their 
options, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's share of Koor will drop to 22 percent 
and Bank Hapo'alim will become the controlling shareholder in 
the company. 
  Bank Hapo'alim already keeps real holdings to the extent 
permitted by law, so the Bank of Israel has instructed it to 
sell its interest in Koor; it is also, in any case, forbidden to 
be the company's largest shareholder. According to the banks' 
restructuring plan, however, Bank Hapo'alim will be required to 
sell most of its holdings in Klal, Deleq, Ampal and Dior P.B. 
Sources close to the bank estimate that it would prefer to sell 
one of its other large holdings provided that it can take 
control of Koor. 
  In any case, changes recently were made in Bank Hapo'alim to 
increase its involvement in Koor. Formally, the creditor banks 
had two representatives on Koor's directorate--Roni Feinstein 
and Moshe Veitman. Bank Hapo'alim, whose holdings entitle it to 
appoint four of Koor's board members, is now working to place 
two of its people on the management council. Those are Dafna 
Peli, secretary of Bank Hapo'alim, and Badan Yahas, who is in 
charge of the bank's finance and customer services divisions. 
Both were involved in overseeing Koor during the recovery plan, 
so they know the company well. 
  "It is not that the board of directors has failed to do its 
duty, God forbid. There were a number of arguments and incidents 
in which the directors refused to confirm plans that management 
had brought. That is the same thing we have seen in Bank Le'umi 
and Bank Hapo'alim. In the same way, it is hard to point to 
anyone who gives orders to Moshe Zanbar or 'Amiram Siyon," says 
one member of the board. 
  As he sees it, Bank Hapo'alim's control of the board of 
directors will change the picture. "The moment that Hapo'alim 
becomes owner and appoints its own people, it will exercise 
tremendous influence in the way it sees fit. It isn't a question 
of caution or of someone with a better understanding of how the 
economy works. 'Amiram Siyon is not preferable to Benny 
Ga'on--they hatched from the same egg. It is a question of 
balance in making decisions."

<F P=106> [Article by Moshe Reinfeld: "An Appeal to the High Court of </F>
Justice To Investigate the `Tailoring' of a Tender Request for 
the Sale of Land in Abu Dis to 'Ateret Kohanim"] 
  [Text] The Peace Now movement and MK [member of Knesset] 
Hayyim Oron appealed yesterday to the High Court of Justice for 
it to order the General Custodian to cancel the tender request 
for the sale of 33 dunams of land in the village of Abu Dis, 
which is south of Jerusalem. They are asking the court to 
instruct the General Custodian to transfer the land to the 
state, and to obligate the government's legal adviser to open an 
investigation into serious irregularities in the procedures of 
the tender request. 
  Presiding High Court of Justice Judge Theodore Or yesterday 
issued a temporary injunction forbidding the carrying out of the 
tender request process, including a meeting that was to be held 
yesterday in the office of the General Custodian, until the 
decision of the High Court of Justice on the appeal. 
  The appellants argue, through attorney Dany Zeydman, that 
the 
very decision to issue the tender request is not legal, and is 
tainted by extreme lack of reasonableness. According to them, 
the decision stems from extraneous considerations of preferring 
the settlers in general and the 'Ateret Kohanim Yeshiva in 
particular, over the good of the public. The appellants argue 
further that even if the decision is found to be reasonable, the 
tender request itself is defective to the extent that it becomes 
a tender request in appearance only. 
  According to the appellants, it becomes clear from the 
minutes of the deliberations of the General Custodian that the 
regular attorney of the 'Ateret Kohanim Society, Eytan Geva, and 
its main contributor, Ervin Moscowitz of the United States, had 
already been brought into the earliest stages in the process of 
the decision to issue the tender request. In this manner, 
'Ateret Kohanim and those close to it were given an unequal 
opportunity to learn about the land being offered for sale and 
to put together their offer accordingly. 
  At the critical meeting where it was decided to issue the 
tender request, only two days before its publication, there was 
discussion of an explicit proposal of 'Ateret Kohanim, and the 
representative of the General Custodian even recommended that 
the proposal be accepted. 
  It is also asserted that the tender request itself was 
issued 
even though the Israel Lands Administration expressed its 
agreement to receive the lands into state ownership. According 
to the appellants, not only did the General Custodian ignore 
this agreement, it also issued the tender request without 
announcing this to the proper persons in the Administration. 
<H5>  A Systematic Policy </H5>
  The appellants also assert that the General Custodian issued 
the tender request even though there are still no plans. This 
means that the price that will be asked for the land will be 
radically lower, and the proceeds from the sale will be reduced. 
The General Custodian issued the tender request after he himself 
acted to release this land for construction, but he abandoned 
this process while it was going on. 
  In this regard, the appellants note that the policy of the 
Israel Lands Administration is not to issue a tender request for 
land that is not planned. 
  The appellants note that a man who was employed by 'Ateret 
Kohanim as an identifier of land in the territories, for the 
purpose of purchasing it, is now employed in a similar position 
in the office of the General Custodian. They emphasize that the 
tender request for the land in Abu Dis was published in only one 
newspaper, in contradiction to the instructions of the law, and 
with an extremely short period for submitting bids. 
  According to the appellants, such acts are actually another 
link in the systematic policy of the General Custodian to 
earmark in advance and illegally monies and land to settler 
societies in East Jerusalem, as a committee headed by Ministry 
of Justice Director-General Hayyim Klugman, which examined the 
subject, has already described. 
  The appellants believe their suspicions were reinforced by 
an 
"appraisal" that was made of the value of the land in Abu Dis. A 
minimum price of only approximately $66,000 was established, 
which is the price a one-room apartment in Jerusalem, was 
established for 33 dunams. 
  It also appears that the General Custodian deviated from the 
statutes regarding tender requests for the sale of lands, to 
which he himself is a signatory. According to these statutes, 
the chairman of the tender request committee is supposed to open 
the envelope that contains the appraisal of the government 
appraiser, and to record it in the minutes, without bringing it 
to the knowledge of the bidders. 
  However, not only was the appraisal known to 'Ateret 
Kohanim, 
but it was also not from the government appraiser, rather from 
the staff officer for appraisals in the Civil Administration in 
the West Bank. And this was even though the land is located in 
an area where Israeli law applies, and which is not in the area 
in which this appraiser specializes.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashraf al-Faqi in Surt: "Al-Qadhdhafi: `We Have </F>
Arrested Spies Working for U.S. Intelligence'"] 
  [Excerpts] Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has 
announced the arrest of spies in the pay of U.S. intelligence. 
AL-HAYAH has also learned that the Libyan General People's 
Conference has conducted a limited cabinet reshuffle. 
  The Libyan media yesterday reported al-Qadhdhafi's remarks 
in 
Banghazi, in which he said that Libya had arrested "spies" 
working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, among them 
hardline Muslims, and threatened that the Libyan people would 
tear any "traitor" to pieces. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi gave no details about the identity or number of 
the alleged spies, but he said that they had spread false rumors 
to the advantage of U.S. intelligence. 
  "The traitors are not only the spies we seized the day 
before 
yesterday," he said, "nor only stray dogs [dissidents], but also 
those who had joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization." 
  He added that the spies were acting as part of a plan to 
weaken the morale of the Libyan people in facing the sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations, to force Libya to hand over those 
accused of blowing up the Pan American plane over Lockerbie. 
  "They [the spies] are responsible for many of the rumors we 
heard in the streets, on the orders of U.S. intelligence," he 
continued. "The rumors were fabricated and concocted for them by 
U.S. intelligence, who asked them to spread them among Libyan 
citizens to hamper the spirit of our people, and make Libyans 
have doubts about their revolution, to weaken them before 
America, Britain, and France, and make them hand over their 
sons. The Libyan people will chop them into pieces." [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Ashraf al-Faqi, in Surt: "Foreign Minister 'Umar </F>
al-Muntasir: `Proposals to End Lockerbie Crisis'"] 
  [Text] Mr. 'Umar al-Muntasir, the secretary of the People's 
Bureau for Foreign Liaison &amp; International Cooperation--the 
Foreign Minister--has announced new Libyan proposals aimed at 
finding a solution to the Lockerbie crisis, with Western sources 
in Libya saying, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, that "the crucial 
thing is not proposals, but Tripoli's compliance with Security 
Council Resolution 731." 
  In a press conference held yesterday in the city of Surt, 
al-Muntasir asked the United States, France, and Britain to help 
his country put an end to the Lockerbie crisis, as the result of 
the "severe harm" done to its economy. He expressed his consent 
to a trial of the suspects in the Lockerbie case, 'Abd-al-Basit 
al-Miqrahi and al-Amin Khalifah Fuhaymah, by Scottish judges in 
any third country (other than the United Kingdom or United 
States) agreeable to the three countries. 
  He accused the American administration of playing the role 
of 
bully in the Security Council. He said that it was putting 
pressure on all the countries, including France, and not even 
sparing Dr. Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United 
Nations. 
  He added that his country had adopted an Egyptian proposal 
last November that demanded the handing over of the suspects to 
France through the Arab-Maghreb Union, adding that France had 
rejected this proposal due to American pressure. "It is not 
just," he said, "for the Americans to reject our efforts to find 
a solution." He renewed his refusal to turn over the suspects to 
the United States or Britain, because they would then "not be 
able to defend themselves." He said that, if the accused were to 
surrender themselves voluntarily to these countries, "all they 
would have to do is to give their names, for them to be found 
guilty." 
  Al-Muntasir called on Germany and Italy to help Libya in its 
efforts to find a solution that "respects Libyan sovereignty," 
given that Germany is a "partner" in the Lockerbie case, as the 
flight of the Pan American aircraft that blew up over Scotland 
had begun in Frankfort. 
  Al-Muntasir accused Arab governments of failing to achieve 
reconciliation, and demanded that their peoples find a way to 
conciliate, especially as "these governments wasted a basic 
opportunity to develop" when the price of a barrel of oil was 
$40. He disclosed that his country is in the process of again 
reviewing its political relations with the countries of the 
world, "in line with [Libya's] interests and those of the Arab 
countries." He said that the peace talks in the Middle East were 
nothing but "surrender solutions." 
  He said, "We are awaiting the outcome of the contacts of 
Arab 
League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid regarding his 
initiative on [Arab] reconciliation." 
  Addressing President Bill Clinton's threat, two weeks ago, 
to 
issue a resolution preventing Libya from exporting its oil, he 
said, "We are dealing with a bully, and we must face facts. We 
have a vicious enemy who can do that. But Libya is prepared to 
live without its oil."

<F P=106> [Article by Ashraf al-Faqi from Surt: "Libyan Central Bank </F>
Governor: `One Third of Liquidity Is Outside Banking System'"] 
  [Text] Libyan Central Bank Governor Mr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz 
Zulaytini has said that the volume of monetary liquidity in his 
country is now nearly 6 billion Libyan dinars [LD], of which 30 
percent is in circulation outside the banking system. 
  He added, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, that Libya would take 
steps to attract this liquidity (partly savings) into the 
channels of the banking system to prevent a drop in the exchange 
rate of the Libyan dinar, and to provide the liquidity needed to 
support projects the authorities have decided to undertake. 
  He views a rise in the interest rate as a major means of 
attracting these savings, saying that the new interest rate 
would exceed the 9 percent currently payable on savings deposits. 
  The Libyan official revealed that his country had resorted 
to 
an "open exchange policy" (without the security of financial 
backing) following the 24 percent decline in its revenues during 
1993, compared to the previous year, in which foreign currency 
revenues were nearly LD2.4 billion. 
  He said that allocations for the various sectors had 
decreased and that the open exchange rate had not exceeded 3 
percent of total revenues. He explained that there were great 
risks in this policy for the exchange rate of the Libyan 
currency and the economic situation. 
  Zulaytini believes that the reform of the economic system in 
Libya could occur through the implementation of policies to hold 
the budget deficit to the lowest possible level. He said that 
this could happen through a high-interest public bond issue, the 
allocation of a budget item to service the public debt, and the 
avoidance of borrowing except for productive projects. 
<H5>  Checks and Cash </H5>
  He called on the Libyan people not to deal in cash, but to 
deposit it in the banking system, so that the use of checks 
might take the place of cash, with the aim of reducing supply. 
He confirmed the need to collect Libya's foreign debts, 
estimated at nearly $2.1 billion and 22 million French francs. 
He emphasized the settlement of these debts in cash or in kind, 
and cautioned that his country would resort to legal means to 
get its money back from abroad should the debtor countries 
procrastinate. 
  He said that halting the smuggling of Libyan dinars abroad 
was the responsibility of security and customs at the various 
frontier points. He called for the strengthening of monitoring 
of currency flight, and of abiding by a law criminalizing it. 
  He added that the Libyan Central Bank's investment revenues 
in foreign commercial banks in 1992 amounted to nearly LD4 
million, and explained that the Central Bank was going to review 
domestic housing loans, which are about 15,000 dinars [each]. 
  He spoke of Libyans who postponed marriage due to the 
scarcity of gold in their country, as the result of the 
UN-imposed sanctions. 
  He alluded to the drop in his country's gold imports, to 
between $17-$20 million, in the framework of limiting foreign 
expenditures.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Ashhab in Rabat] </F>
  [Text] A call from Moroccan opposition parties to end the 
house arrest of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine has raised questions 
about the kind of relationship anticipated between these parties 
and Islamic groups in Morocco. 
  With the exception of the traditionally-inclined Istiqlal 
[Independence] Party, which has previously called for the 
absorption of these groups, the other opposition parties, 
especially the Socialist Union and Democratic Action, have 
viewed with discomfort the growth of the role of the Islamic 
groups. Their political bases in Moroccan universities, 
especially in Fes and Casablanca, have clashed with Islamic 
movements, while the Party of Progress and Socialism (formerly 
the Communist Party) has not ceased calling for resistance to 
these groups, which had virtually overwhelmed Morocco's 
universities, in return for a drop in the influence of the 
traditional parties. Its leader, Ali Yata, brought up this 
question in political and official meetings, demanding an end to 
the exploitation of the universities by extremist Islamic 
groups. The same is the case with the imams of some mosques, who 
oppose the existence of a communist party in the country. 
  While the opposition parties' campaign in defense of Shaykh 
Yacine is part of the process of bringing up the problem of 
human rights conditions in the country, and to obtain the 
political and financial support from these groups in support of 
opposition aims, it is noteworthy that some political parties 
have recently raised the issue of working together with the 
Islamic groups. Their condition is a commitment to a political 
plan based upon legality. According to opposition politicians, 
there are dozens of Islamic organizations in Morocco at work 
raising religious awareness. Some of them bear a political 
stamp, which imposes a formula for dealing with them, 
particularly as the Islamic groups have shown their presence in 
the large demonstrations held during the Gulf crisis and in 
labor holiday festivities. 
  The Socialist Union's acting leader, Mohamed Yazghi, said 
that these groups had voted for the opposition parties in the 
recent legislative elections in major cities such as Rabat, 
Sali, and Fes. Lawyers affiliated with opposition activities 
have defended members belonging to the Justice and Charity 
Society led by Shaykh Yacine in several trials in 1990. This was 
not the case in the 1984 trials, when a plan to disturb the 
country's security, led by extremist groups linked with foreign 
parties, was uncovered. 
  In this context it may be mentioned that the Moroccan 
Government is formulating a plan for confronting the extremist 
Islamic groups, typified by its ban on mosques engaging in 
political activity. It has stopped the imams of some mosques who 
had been engaging in these activities. The Ministry of Islamic 
Affairs undertook the opening of a dialogue with the Islamic 
groups committed to admonition and guidance rather than forcing 
themselves into political controversy. It is noteworthy that the 
leaders of Islamic movements in several Arab and Islamic 
movements participated in demonstrations held in Casablanca as 
part of what was known as the Islamic Awakening Community. It 
has been decided that Morocco will, in the coming weeks, host a 
conference of ministers of Islamic affairs from the Arab and 
Islamic worlds, to discuss the idea of coexistence and 
reconciliation among Islamic sects. 
  The Islamic Awakening Community will focus, in a conference 
to be held this month, on studying this question and other 
related problems, in cooperation with Islamic groups. 
  Concerned persons believe that the call of the opposition 
parties, whose agendas diverge from the direction of the Islamic 
parties, has to do with putting political pressure on the 
government, by putting thorny problems before the 
recently-created Ministry of Human Rights. The least of these 
would be the studying of the conditions of detainees belonging 
to Islamic groups, and urging international organizations to 
show renewed concern for the state of human rights. 
  Those who follow these developments say that the political 
goal in raising this issue appears obviously through their 
presentation in Parliament, where it was possible for the 
Consultative Council on Human Rights, concerned with the defense 
of human rights, to study it. Opposition party circles 
themselves do not hide their discomfort at this trend, which 
could backfire on the opposition itself, as the affiliates of 
the Islamic groups mistrust the role of the traditional parties, 
and go farther than they do in the field of implementing Islamic 
law. There is nothing indicating the possibility of agreement 
between the agendas of the two sides, though they both agree in 
opposing the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Sharqi in Rabat] </F>
  [Text] A World Bank delegation is currently on a one-week 
visit to Morocco, representing its board, and including 
representatives of Germany, France, Spain, China, Poland, and 
Chile. The World Bank delegation is conducting talks with 
several officials of the Moroccan Government. The purpose of the 
visit is exploratory, according to the members of the 
delegation. They also met with the board of the Union of 
Moroccan Banks, the General Federation of Businessmen, and the 
Governor of the Central Bank. They visited the regions of 
Morocco in which projects partially or fully funded by the World 
bank are located. The World Bank delegation is also waiting to 
meet with Moroccan Prime Minister Mr. Mohamed Karim Lamrani. 
  The preliminary statement the delegation issued after its 
arrival in Morocco this week said that the World Bank and 
members of its board want a greater familiarity with trends in 
the Moroccan economy, especially in the areas of liberalization 
and privatization, project funding, the banking system, 
investment, and related operation and regulations. The World 
Bank indicated that it had offered Morocco, over 30 years, over 
$6.7 billion in loans and assorted funding. It is now committed 
to participation in funding 30 development projects, with loans 
worth a total of $2.9 billion in the areas of agriculture, 
irrigation, housing, the environment, education, public works, 
transport, and others. 
  The World Bank report for 1993-1994 published in Washington 
last week indicated that Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia are the 
Arab countries that have obtained the highest percentage of the 
Bank's loans, and the largest rate of foreign investment. The 
report explained that the economic liberalization pursued by 
these countries has helped them to obtain increased foreign 
investments. 
  For their part, Moroccan sources said that the World Bank's 
total loans represent nearly a third of Morocco's total foreign 
debt, which stood at $20.5 billion at the end of last year, of 
which 17 percent were commercial loans after the rescheduling 
arranged with the London Club last year. According to the 
statement made by World Bank Vice President Koch Fiers [name as 
transliterated] during his Moroccan visit two weeks ago (he met 
with King Hassan II in Marrakech), the World Bank is seeking to 
boost the volume of loans offered annually to Morocco, to 
approach $800 million to $1 billion annually, as against about 
$560 million last year. The Bank, however, wants in return to be 
familiar with the new (profitable) projects that it can fund in 
whole or in part, saying that the Moroccan economy needs to 
prove its ability to absorb these loans. 
  The World Bank mission's presence in Morocco coincides with 
the continuation of the parliamentary discussion of the $10 
billion 1994 budget plan, which stipulates increased local 
economic liberalization and a decrease in the budget deficit of 
1.5 percent of gross domestic product, and economic growth in 
excess of 7 percent. 
  The Moroccan Government wants to use 1994's privatization 
revenues, estimated at $400 million, to boost economic 
performance, develop the employment field, and reduce the tax 
burden imposed on companies and individuals, besides permitting 
the local and foreign private sector to invest in strategic 
sectors that had been the preserve of the public sector, such as 
energy, transport, irrigation, communications, and public works. 
It is waiting, in light of the World Bank delegation's visit, to 
define the volume of loans the Bank will offer Morocco in 1994 
and 1995, part of which Morocco wants to allocate to fund youth 
projects and provide additional job opportunities to help the 
local economy adapt to the global economy after the signature of 
the GATT accord in Marrakech in mid-April this year. That 
occasion will be attended by a number of heads of state from 
industrialized countries, including President Bill Clinton, 
according to Moroccan sources preparing the holding of the 
global GATT conference.

  [Text] The Moroccan Union of Workers has sent an open 
letter to the head of the government, calling for the opening of 
an urgent dialogue before the middle of this month, to study 
union conditions . 
  Secretary General of the Democratic Confederation of Labor 
Noubir Lamaoui [name as transliterated], indicated, in a letter 
of which Al-SHARQ AL-AWSAT obtained a fax copy, the need for a 
quick start negotiations between the government and the unions 
to study labor and worker issues, to put an end to the dismissal 
of workers and the closure of mines and companies, and the 
return of all workers dismissed for their union activity, 
increasing wages, and raising the minimum wage. 
  In his letter, Lamaoui criticized the brief and superficial 
meetings between the government and the unions, indicating that 
these meetings had done little to address workers' problems. 
  He mentioned that in December 1990, the Democratic 
Confederation of Labor had called for a general strike, which 
led to the outbreak of disturbances in a number of Moroccan 
cities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hammud Bin-Hilal al-Habasi, undersecretary </F>
for economic affairs, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani, in Muscat, date 
not given: "Finance Official Discusses 1994 Budget"] 
  [Text] The Sultanate of Oman has confirmed that despite the 
current drop in both oil prices and oil revenue, the general 
expenditure in the 1994 budget (2.033 billion rials [RO]) has 
been reduced by only 5 percent. 
  Hammud Bin-Hilal al-Habasi, undersecretary for economic 
affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs 
[ministry name as published], said that this reduction will lead 
to neither a recession nor a slowdown of economic growth. 
  The Omani official told AL-HAYAH that despite the fall of 
oil 
prices, the estimated budget deficit in 1994 will be 20 percent 
less than that of the previous year. 
  Gulf banking sources stated that Oman asked four banks in 
the 
Gulf region, the West, and Japan to provide her with a new loan 
in the amount of $300 million. However, al-Habasi argues that 
the $2.6 billion of foreign debt that existed at the beginning 
of the present five-year plan will be the same at the end of the 
plan period in 1995, resulting in a zero figure of Omani net 
borrowing from abroad. 
  The undersecretary in the Omani Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Affairs indicated that Oman was undertaking procedures 
such as reviewing and modernizing investment laws as well as 
establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework 
for commercial, investment, and financial activities that are in 
accordance with the free economy policy and market mechanism. 
  Following are details of the interview: 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of the current year's 
budget 
reduction compared to both last year's reduction and that 
estimated and included in the fourth five-year plan? 
  [Al-Habasi] There is no reduction with regards to the gross 
general revenue which has been estimated in the 1994 budget at 
about RO1732.1 million representing a 2-percent increase over 
the 1993 figure of about RO1698.5 million in the endorsed 
budget. This increase is mainly due to the estimated increase in 
the natural gas revenue and in other current revenues. 
  As for the figure for the general revenue for the current 
year as it appears in the five-year plan, it has been estimated 
at RO1.780 billion representing an increase of about RO48 
million over the estimate of the current budget. This slight 
increase in the general revenue is due to the fact that oil 
revenue for 1994 had been estimated at RO1.364 billion in the 
fourth five-year plan. However, due to the drop in oil prices, 
this revenue had been estimated at RO1.311 billion in the 1994 
budget. 
  Total general expenditure in the 1994 budget has been 
estimated at RO2.033 billion compared to RO2138.5 million in the 
1993 budget with a decrease of about 5 percent. Meanwhile, the 
estimated figure for total general expenditure in the 1994 
budget is more than the RO1.958 billion figure estimated for 
1994 in the fourth five-year plan. 
  It is thus clear that estimates for general expenditure 
tally 
with the government directives to reach a balance and narrow the 
gap between revenue and expenditure. 
  It is also worth mentioning that decree number 1/94 issued 
by 
the Sultan to endorse the budget indicated that it was possible 
to review some expenditure items in case the net oil revenue 
dropped below average estimated prices due to the drop in world 
oil prices because of the current delicate and complicated world 
economic conditions. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the size of reduction in both the 
current general expenditure and the investment expenditure in 
the new budget? 
  [Al-Habasi] The general current expenditure is estimated in 
this year's budget at about RO1.5859 billion compared to 1.6175 
billion in the 1993 budget. As for the investment expenditure, 
it is estimated in the current budget at about RO431.6 million 
compared to about RO495.8 million in the 1993 budget. 
  As I indicated in my previous response, the reduction in the 
size of the general expenditure came as a result of the drop in 
world oil prices and the impact of that on revenues and 
consequently on the size of general expenditure and the current 
deficit. 
  It is worth noting that the current budget is geared to 
serve 
development and provide the necessary allotments for new 
projects that are expected to be executed during the current 
year. Therefore, the reduction decided upon for investment 
expenditure will not greatly impact the previously endorsed 
figure of RO448 million for investment expenditure programs for 
1994 in the five-year plan. This is because allotments endorsed 
for the programs seem quite similar to the figures, which have 
been previously quoted, of the current budget. 
  Therefore, though oil prices have affected the current 
budget, it remains balanced, financially sound, and able to 
preserve the good developmental achievements that were executed 
in the Sultanate. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] What is the anticipated 1994 budget deficit 
and the "actual deficit" in the budget of 1993, the year when 
the current drop in oil prices occurred? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The deficit estimated in the 1994 budget 
amounts to RO300.9 million compared to RO375 million in the 1993 
budget and represents a 20-percent reduction. Therefore, 
particularly in light of the current drop in oil prices in world 
markets, it seems that this reduction is sound and in harmony 
with the policies and procedures applied by the government in 
order to tackle the deficit problem. 
  The "actual" 1993 budget deficit will be determined later on 
following the preparation and endorsement of the 1993 final 
accounts. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Which measures would be used to tackle the 
deficit in the new budget? Will those measures involve more 
withdrawal from the state's general reserves, or would there be 
recourse to domestic and foreign borrowing? 
  [Al-Habasi] As I have previously mentioned, the current 
budget deficit is about RO300.9 million. Measures to finance it 
include resorting to state funds worth RO221 million and to RO48 
million as receipts of government development bonds, in addition 
to acquiring RO31.9 million in the form of net borrowing and aid. 
  A positive indicator is the fact that the figure for 
estimates of withdrawals from state bonds has been cut down from 
about RO292 millions in the 1993 budget to about 221 million in 
that of the current year. 
  It is also worth mentioning that the resort to government 
devlopment bonds and foreign borrowing were financing measures 
mentioned in the fourth five-year plan. These measures are being 
used in accordance with the relevant endorsed regulations. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that, due to the drop in 
oil revenues, the government should review its decision not to 
increase foreign borrowing above the average reached during the 
current plan of $2.6 billion. Will the Sultanate accordingly 
arrange for foreign loans from either friendly countries or 
world banks as happened following the 1986 oil crisis? 
  [Al-Habasi] I would like to indicate that the decision you 
refer to in your question was included in the fourth five-year 
plan, which stipulated that the size of the general foreign 
borrowing should remain fixed at the figure it had reached at 
the end of the third five-year plan: i.e., about RO1 billion. 
  This means that it is possible to arrange for new foreign 
borrowing during the plan years. In fact, the planned borrowing 
during the fourth five-year plan period would be equal to the 
amount of loans paid back during the same period; the general 
foreign debt would be thus the same at the end of the plan 
period as it was at its beginning, i.e., the "net" foreign 
borrowing would be zero. This scenario is the one currently 
applied. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Procedures to cut down general expenditure 
included cutting down recurrent expenses, freezing or abolishing 
annual salary raises and professional allowances, and having new 
regulations for travel tickets, as well as for housing for those 
coming from abroad to be employed by the state. How much savings 
would these procedures yield in the budget? Besides, do the 
benefits accruing from these procedures outweigh the expected 
risks that they may cause, such as slowing down of economic 
growth and slump in some economic sectors, particularly those 
with an active private sector? 
  [Al-Habasi] First of all, let me correct some inaccurate 
information that is included in the question. First: Annual 
raises have not been frozen or abolished; they continue to be 
paid and the current budget includes the extra funds necessary 
to pay periodic raises to employees of ministries and all 
government units. Second: Professional allowances have not been 
frozen or abolished, they have simply been reduced by 50 
percent. As you know, this is not an allowance for all 
government employees, but is only granted to some of them 
according to either the nature of their jobs or to special 
circumstances that were valid during the last few years and no 
longer exist. 
  As for the procedures that were mentioned and that have been 
resorted to in the framework of the comprehensive tackling of 
the financial conditions, they aim not only at reducing 
expenditures but primarily at rationalizing spending, cutting 
down on administrative expenses and providing elasticity in 
applying the benefits that are given to those coming from abroad 
to work for the government. I would like to seize this 
opportunity to affirm the following: 
  First: There has been no change in basic salaries and 
periodic raises that were given to government employees as 
acquired rights. 
  Second: We have rationalized spending and provided 
elasticity 
in applying the benefits granted to those coming from abroad to 
work for the government. However, those benefits should be well 
used in such a way that would allow those using them to choose 
the housing and travel fit for them. It should also be noted 
that these new procedures will save the government some expenses 
and lessen its responsibilities and administrative work; they 
will also enable it to control expenditure and waste. 
  Third: The reduction in government spending will not create 
any noticeable recession trends that could impact the economy as 
a whole and the private sector in particular. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] It has become crucial to harmonize--on the 
one hand--between national laws such as those concerned with 
work and workers, investment, trials and commercial arbitration 
and--on the other hand--international codes and conventions. 
With regards to this issue, is the Sultanate ready to revise 
some current laws in order to make them more compatible with 
world codes and directives that are encompassed in the framework 
of the new world economic order? 
  [Al-Habasi] In view of severe economic international 
competition, the Sultanate Government, since the onset of the 
blessed renaissance of 1970, realized the necessity of adopting 
the free economy system. It therefore provided the legal and 
institutional framework for encouraging and facilitating both 
the private sector activities and domestic and foreign 
investment. Subsequently, besides issuing commercial, 
investment, customs, financial, and monetary laws, the Sultanate 
issued laws dealing with work and workers, immigration and 
visas, as well as commercial disputes, etc. 
  In order to give a push to development and progress in the 
Sultanate, as well as to confront the novelties and changes in 
the world economy, the concerned authorities are currently 
working towards reviewing, modernizing, and developing many of 
the laws and legislation that are currently being applied. This 
procedure aims at establishing a comprehensive legal and 
institutional framework for commercial, investment, and 
financial agencies and activities that would be compatible with 
the Sultanate's directive of adopting the free economy system, 
which relies on both the market mechanism and free competition 
and which has become the main concept of the new world economic 
order.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Malil al-Mikhlafi, secretary general </F>
of Unified Nasirite Organization [UNO], by 'Adnan al-Sahili, in 
Yemen; date not given: "The Conflict Is About Building the State 
and Not About Unity"] 
  [Text] Tripoli--Delegations representing various political 
powers in Yemen participated in the business of the meeting of 
the Arab Democratic Revolutionary Dialogue in the Libyan capital 
last month. The most prominent delegation was that of the 
Unified People's Nasirite Organization, which is headed by the 
secretary general of the Organization, 'Abd-al-Malik 
al-Mikhlafi, whom the general conference of the Organization 
elected during its convening last month. 
  AL-SAFIR met with al-Mikhlafi and interviewed him about 
organizational issues and about the imminent dangers for Yemen: 
  [AL-SAFIR] Recently, your organization held its general 
conference and elected new leadership. In what context did this 
change take place? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] The Unified People's Nasirite Organization is 
an organization deeply rooted in Yemen. It is more than 28 years 
old. The last conference that talked about it was the Eighth 
National General Conference of the Organization. It was held in 
Sanaa from the 23-27 of last November. It was a Nasirite, 
national, patriotic rally attended by a large number of 
representatives of parties, Yemeni political organizations, and 
representatives of Nasirite organizations and parties in the 
Arab Homeland. 
  The conference was considered a democratic rally, and a 
unified rally, because it was held in the atmosphere of the 
political crisis and, therefore, the Nasirites assured 
throughout it their adherence to Yemeni unity. It was also 
considered a democratic rally because it reflected democracy in 
the Organization through the conference taking place across the 
domestic elections, which began in the basic units in the 
villages, and are interconnected at the governorates level. The 
National General Conference concluded with the elections of the 
Central Committee of the Organization and the secretariat 
general through the Central Committee. 
  In this conference, a central committee of 91 members that 
combined branches of the Organization in the governorates and 
abroad was elected. And, for the first time, Nasirite women in 
the Central Committee participated in it, where four Nasirite 
women were elected as basic members, in addition to five elected 
as candidate members. The conference reflected the 
organizational and popular weight of the Organization and 
assured the place of the Nasirite organization as one of four 
main organizations in the country and as a fourth party, in 
addition to the three parties in the government. It is 
absolutely the most prominent Yemeni opposition party. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is the conference considered a stopping place in 
the ending of the differences between the Nasirites in Yemen on 
the course towards unification of their ranks, or are the 
previous differences still continuing? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] It is certain that what you are referring to 
in 
terms of differences was the remainder of the period of 
repression that the Nasirites faced, i.e., the period of 
bisection, since the two previous bisected systems with a 
unionist mentality tried to beat down and fragment the Nasirites 
and tried to fabricate Nasirite names on the periphery of the 
Unified People's Nasirite Organization. But, by the testimony of 
the press in Yemen, including the official press, the conference 
was a plebiscite to the fact that this organization represents 
the Nasirites in Yemen, that it was the end to all the naming 
that the governing parties fabricated with the goal of 
fragmenting the Nasirite movement and beating it down, and 
especially that the conference reflected the reality of the 
Nasirite organization's unity in Yemen. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is it possible for your success in Yemen to be 
reflected by the Nasirite position on the general Arab level? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] It is certain if the Nasirites in the whole 
Arab homeland arrived at rebuilding their position, as happened 
in Yemen, with a new spirit and new methods in organizational 
and political action, it is possible that this conference, which 
representatives of a number of Nasirite parties attended, would 
be a beginning of the awakening of Nasirite action in general. 
  We were aiming in Yemen at presenting a new Nasirite model 
that is dependent upon wide political action, people's action, 
and open action and also on the forming of democratic methods in 
political action that guarantee the solidifying of 
organizational Nasirite action. We presented this model to all 
the political powers and to our Nasirite brothers in the rest of 
the Arab homeland. We believe that the Nasirite participation 
from the Arab homeland in the conference represents a special 
state of awakening and that the statement that was issued about 
the Nasirite organizations participating in the conference 
entitled "A Call to the Nation" was expressing this state. These 
various private Nasirite organizations that are now working 
publicly and legally, along with the other Nasirite 
organizations that are still working under the shadow of 
repression, agreed on more ordering of the advancement of 
Nasirite work and the creation of national Nasirite institutions 
arranging Nasirite work on the basis of public, democratic, and 
legal action. 
  [AL-SAFIR] These days Yemen is witnessing a fierce conflict 
between its governing parties. So, are the fears about the unity 
of Yemen and about the democracy in Yemen real fears? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] The conflicts present in Yemen stir up some 
internal anxiety, but they arouse more fears abroad. Maybe it's 
that most people don't realize the nature of the political 
conditions in Yemen. 
  It is true that the present political crisis is deep, and it 
is deeper than any crisis that the country has gone through 
since unity. But, in my estimation, the fears about Yemeni unity 
don't reach the degree that is presented abroad in view of the 
fact that the conflict taking place in Yemen concerns the 
building of the state, and not unity. All the political powers 
agree on the difference of their orientations no matter what 
their position in the conflict. However, unity is from the 
constants, which are not allowed to be violated, just as the 
political movement in the country is a united movement and there 
is not a northern party and another southern that can be said to 
be representing this or that part of the country. But, maybe 
because the sides of the conflict become stronger with old 
devices, bisecting devices, it appears sometimes that the 
conflict has a direct relationship to unity. But, it is my 
estimation that the conflict revolves around the building of the 
state. Maybe this is where there is agreement among the various 
Yemenis on the multiplicity of their intellectual and political 
memberships, namely that whatever happens can lead to a better 
way out on the issue of building the single state and on the 
issue of consolidating democracy. This doesn't create real 
dangers to unity, but rather the dangers would come if the 
conflict didn't enter into a far-reaching stage in the dialogue 
that is prevailing now. Yemenis agree that dialogue and peaceful 
methods are the tools of management of the conflict. If this 
dialogue deviates from its course, and is substituted by 
violence and non-dialogue methods, it is possible that dangers 
will form, not dangers to Yemeni unity in the old sense, but to 
all of Yemen. 
  In my estimation, Yemen, if it doesn't close the dialogue 
and 
put an end to this crisis, may enter into a whirlpool of civil 
war and violence which may not lead to redividing into two parts 
as before, but will lead to the fragementation of Yemen more 
than it was fragmented before unity. Likewise, the various 
political powers including the National Block for the Opposition 
that forms the spine of the Unified Nasirite Organization, are 
exerting great efforts to keep the conflict in the sphere of 
peaceful and democratic dialogue. If it remains in this 
framework, as is happening today, the differences circulating in 
Yemen now could form a positive turning point for the good of 
building a modern Yemeni state, a state of order and law, as 
most of the political powers in the country are demanding now. 
It could also strengthen the journey of democracy, especially 
through the demands, on which there is partial agreement, for 
the strengthening of local government and election of directors 
of the provinces and the chief officers of the governorates and 
the encouragement of democracy in the country. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Are there certain general rules for the 
preservation of the unity of Yemen? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] In my estimation, the unity of the political 
movement and the presence of political action along all of Yemen 
forms a measure of the control. Furthermore, the state of 
popular, national, and political agreement with regard to unity 
is one of the fundamental invariables, violation of which is not 
permitted. 
  Here I point out that some of the papers that were presented 
concerning the subject of establishing a federalist state in 
Yemen were confronted by strong rejection from all the political 
powers whatever movement they belong to, which confirms the 
adherence of all Yemenis to unity. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is there a possibility available to the hostile 
powers for arousing certain considerations in order to provoke 
sedition in Yemen? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] It is certain that the powers hostile to 
Yemeni 
unity and the adjacent reactionary powers played [a role] 
throughout the last period and exploited the atmosphere of the 
crisis for the sake of stirring up ailing struggles. So, they 
presented issues like the North and the South, the oppression of 
the Northern minority by the Southern majority, and the 
Zaidites, Shafiitics, and the Bedouin subdivisions. However, in 
my estimation, there is a popular consciousness that rejects 
ailing presentations such as this. 
  There is a conviction of those who raise these slogans, and 
all the political organizations and all the conferences and the 
festivals confirm the adherence to Yemeni unity and the 
rejection of ailing struggles, and especially the Yemeni people, 
among whom, practically speaking, sectarian conflicts are not 
found, but rather, political ones. There is an attempt to raise 
these slogans with the goal of creating a state of division in 
Yemeni society, but they are judged and rejected and the 
political and partisan movement and the elite that represents 
the Yemeni people are unified on the sectarian and regional 
level, and sectarian or regional or Bedouin movements are not 
found existing in independent entities. In my estimation, these 
designs will continue to provoke and incite ailing struggles and 
will exploit some of their minor men present in Yemen. However, 
there is a trust in the existence of a popular consciousness 
that rejects suggestions like this. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Do you see that this conflict is related to 
developments that the Arab region is witnessing, where the 
creation of a problem for every Arab country is taking place? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] Yemeni unity has been targeted since its 
establishment, especially from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. 
This targeting was strengthened by the Gulf Crisis and the 
Yemeni popular position that rejected foreign interference in 
the crisis and, therefore, what resulted from this situation in 
terms of the expulsion of one andone-half million Yemenis from 
the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, defining what formed the 
wearing economic crisis in Yemen. It was also reflected in the 
framework of the political crisis, in addition to the presence 
of a number of centers of power and influential people and 
elements linked to the neighboring countries in the region that 
play a role in starting the crisis and increasing the sharpness 
of the conflict in Yemen. Thus, what is happening in the region 
is not far from what is happening in Yemen also, in terms of a 
crisis having the goal of shattering this unity and making the 
countries enter into a whirlpool that will no doubt be reflected 
in the whole peninsula region and the Gulf considering that 
Yemen is the largest country of the region and the most densely 
populated, which could make the Arab region in all of the 
peninsula and the Gulf enter into a whirlpool. There is no doubt 
that it serves the plans that want to rearrange the situation of 
the Arab nation for the good of the Zionist project or what is 
called the Middle Eastern order. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What is your opinion of the stopping points that 
the Arab-Israeli negotiations have arrived at and the current 
peace projects? 
  [Al-Mikhlafi] The position of the Unified People's Nasirite 
Organization does not differ from the position of the Nasirite 
trend in all the Arab countries. It is the position that has 
refused the settlement path from the beginning and the position 
that judged and assessed properly the Gaza-Jericho agreement as 
an agreement that abandons the Palestinian issue, strengthens 
the Zionist project, supports the setting up of what is called 
Greater Israel, and sends out the American call for the 
establishment of the Middle East order. 
  Second, ai the level of action, the Unified People's 
Nasirite 
Organization was the first and the most prominent of the 
organizations that was moved in the Yemeni arena to express its 
rejection to the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the settlement path. 
It mobilized the widest popular support for its position. This 
position of the Yemeni people, who expressed their rejection of 
the agreement, agitated the sides of the settlement and 
especially the influential leadership in the PLO. 
  Third, the Eighth National General Conference of the 
Organization consisted of a national rally for the conviction of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Was it because of the attendance, 
which was limited to all those rejecting the agreement, or 
because of the slogans of the conference and the calls that were 
sent out in it? Thus, we consider that the settlement paths, 
whose most prominent last stopping place was the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, are targeting the [Arab] nation and its awakening and 
cultural project. There is no choice before any Arab except the 
fighting of this project, which aims at the [Arab] nation and 
its existence, the fighting of all the normalization plans and 
whatever calls for a Middle Eastern order, the overthrowing of 
this despicable and humiliating agreement, the strengthening of 
the Palestinian intifadah by every nationalistic means, and the 
success of the Arab cultural project.
