  [Text] Sanaa--Some of the principal political powers in 
Yemen are in the midst of a fierce and foreboding debate 
concerning the significance of the awakening of the Bakil tribe 
and the extent of the connection of this rising to any of the 
governing political parties. The United Bakil Council concluded 
the business of its first general conference, which was held in 
the region of the Anisi tribes, the day before yesterday, amidst 
opposition to it and its rejection by some of the political and 
tribal symbols of Anisi, and especially those belonging to the 
Popular General People's Congress, the leader of which is the 
Yemeni president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  While these same mentioned that the conference was plagued 
with failure because of their refusal to receive it in their 
regions, Shaykh Muhammad 'Ali Abu Luhum confirmed in a telephone 
call to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the conference was crowned by 
success and was attended by about 40,000 people from among the 
men of the Bakil tribes and various governorates. 
  He confirmed the error of those who portrayed the Bakil 
conference as putting forth a call for disunion, when it is 
exactly the opposite. Likewise, he rejects any process of 
political or partisan polarization. 
  He referred to the decisions and recommendations that the 
conference issued at the end of its business and which the 
closing statement contained. They concentrated on the handling 
of the internal issues of the Bakil tribes first, and on the 
presentation of a group of special and general issues in various 
spheres, the most important of which is working to display the 
civilized side of the Bakil tribes, the effective participation 
in building the Yemeni state, the preservation of unity and 
democracy, the accomplishments of the revolution, the doing away 
with any differences in the Bakil framework, and the striving to 
end all differences between it and the other tribes. 
  The Bakil conference confirmed its devotion to unity and 
democracy as an irrevocable choice, and the working towards 
sovereignty of the law and the system. It demanded the "sound 
rebuilding of the security organizations nationally, and the 
reformation of the armed forces so that they protect the country 
and its sovereignty and are not a heavy weight on the nation or 
a protector or friend of the people in power or in the parties." 
  The Bakil tribes demanded to be made a participant, through 
their United Council, in any arrangements relating to 
state-building issues. [They also demanded] the acceptance of 
the Bakil Council's opinion, the necessity of giving the Bakil 
people and all the ordinary people an equal opportunity in 
public service, including the armed forces and security forces, 
without reservation, in the same manner as others from among the 
tribes, and the taking of an interest in the rights of all the 
families of the martyrs. 
  Likewise, the Bakil Council demanded the necessity of 
completing the centralization and the granting of full powers to 
the people of the governorates and districts, which enables them 
to serve their regions according to the system of local 
governing. [They also demanded] the rebuilding of the state 
organizations, and for the end of the double standard, and 
giving the qualified individuals and cadres the positions that 
they deserve. They demanded the hastening of the end of the 
present crisis, which is on the verge of threatening the unity 
of the country, and the necessity of requiring all the political 
powers, and especially those within the framework of the 
governing coalition, to refrain from all the practices that tend 
to cause disunion inside society. 
  The statement also demanded that all the parties refrain 
from 
political provocation that leads to breach of security and 
violation of the national constants and hinders the movement of 
life. Regarding the army and security, it demanded purging both 
of them of the elements whose failure has been proved and which 
had a role in frustrating the responsibilities of this 
institution, and then replacing them with new elements that are 
capable of undertaking their role free and clear of 
subordination to people or parties or to the influential people 
in power. 
  It demanded working to withdraw the armed forces from inside 
the cities, doing away with the subordination of the armed 
forces to the sections of power, and opening the door of service 
to all ordinary people. Likewise, it demanded the changing of 
the heads of the armed forces in the various military units who 
belong to any one of the sections of power, or those who belong 
to one region, and taking another look at the appointment of 
these leaders, on the condition that the retirement law be 
applied, and the process of blind conscription be stopped. 
  In the economic sphere, the statement pointed to the need to 
require the government to maintain public funds and to paralyze 
the hands tinkering with them, to observe the activity of the 
revenue-related institutions and the central bank, to not 
monopolize the public funds in the hands of an individual or 
party who uses them to buy protections and party and political 
loyalties, and [the need] to prevent the administering of the 
public funds for anything except what is in agreement with the 
regulations and laws, in the framework of what the public budget 
of the state establishes. 
  It demanded the hastening of putting plans and reform and 
growth programs into place, the limiting of luxury government 
spending, the checking of the process of issuing money, the 
abolishing of what is called invisible clauses and the 
application of the principle of financial protection, and the 
putting into operation of the principle of "Where did you get 
this?" 
  Likewise, it demanded the limitation of the number of 
workers 
in the state institutions, including the army and the security 
forces, the opening of the door of compulsory retirement for the 
people in high positions of responsibility, the hastening to 
finish the establishment of the free economic and trade zone in 
the capital, Aden, and the directing of oil revenues towards 
what produces a push to the production process and the building 
of an agricultural renaissance. The statement touched on the 
demand for various services and the treatment of problems of 
revenge, and the new manifestations of crime and drugs and the 
like. 
  The statement concluded with the Bakil Council's assurance 
that these demands express the concerns and aspirations of all 
the ordinary people, and not just the Bakil people. However, the 
Council takes the presentation of these demands upon itself 
within the scope of its comprehensive national directives.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29--Contrary to the belief here, the 
U.S. Administration maintains that its policy on South Asia 
remained consistent in 1993 despite the change in presidency. 
  According to an official year-end review of the U.S. 
relations with the Indian sub-continent (details of which are 
available here), most of the themes sounded by the Clinton 
Administration on "South Asia--nuclear non-proliferation, 
democracy-building, human rights, free trade and economic 
reform--echo the policies set in place by his precedessor, 
George Bush." That is because, it says, these broad goals best 
define American interests in the post-cold war world and are 
particularly relevant to South Asia. 
  Indo-Pak. tensions: The historic tensions between 
the region's two strongest countries, India and Pakistan, the 
review notes, have become far more troubling in recent years, 
now that both are widely considered to possess a nuclear weapons 
capability. Added to the volatile mix is the ongoing instability 
in Afghanistan, where security risks have prevented the United 
States from re-opening its embassy. The breakup of the former 
Soviet Union evoked a wholesale re-evaluation in Washington of 
U.S. relations with the former eastern bloc, but its effect on 
U.S. South Asia policy has been subtle. In the Presidency of Mr. 
Bill Clinton, the changes, it is pointed out, have come in the 
degree of emphasis placed on particular issues. 
  It cites the views expressed by the U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, and other officials from time to 
time that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is a "disputed" 
territory. Questioning the suggestions in sections of South 
Asian media, "for largely parochial reasons" that the Clinton 
Administration had modified the South Asia policy, it quotes the 
following remarks of the State Department spokesman in November: 
"As we have noted consistently since 1947, the United States 
believes the entire geographic area of the former princely State 
of Jammu and Kashmir is disputed territory. The United States 
believes the best way to resolve the dispute over Kashmir is 
through direct discussions between the Governments of India and 
Pakistan as envisioned in the (1972) Shimla agreement, taking 
into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people." 
  Delhi sees new elements: As seen in New Delhi, the 
Clinton Administration introduced new elements in its South Asia 
policy, with recurring references to the "wishes of the Kashmiri 
people" and its willingness to help resolve (in other words, 
"mediate") the problem if desired by the two sides. 
  The debate over the possible scrapping of the Pressler 
Amendment is summed up thus: "Another U.S. policy that is likely 
to provoke regional opposition but remain unchanged is the 
suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan. The 1985 Pressler Amendment 
to U.S. law requires that aid to Pakistan be withheld unless the 
U.S. President can certify that Islamabad does not possess 
nuclear weapons capability. The Bush administration revoked 
Pakistan's certification in 1990, and the aid cutoff has 
remained in effect ever since. Although the Clinton White House 
indicated in 1993 an interest in removing `country-specific' 
language from the foreign aid law to allow presidential 
discretion in such decisions, the principle that underlines the 
Pressler Amendment continues to be upheld. As a result, the aid 
cutoff can be expected to continue until Pakistan's nuclear 
programme ceases to be of international concern." 
  Priority for non-proliferation: Citing Mr. 
Clinton's address to the U.N. General Assembly that he had "made 
non-proliferation one of our nation's highest priorities," the 
review describes how that official message was brought home 
during an October State Department briefing, with the statement 
that the United States was "particularly concerned" about the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in regions such as 
South Asia. "We have ongoing, senior-level discussions on this 
issue with the Governments of Pakistan and India and we will 
continue to urge both Governments to undertake direct, 
high-level discussions on this and other issues dividing them, 
including Kashmir." 
  Among the "good news" were the decision by India and 
Pakistan 
to resume official talks and the elections in the two countries, 
according to the official document. 
  The Pakistani elections, according to the review, were 
widely 
hailed as having been the freest and fairest in its history with 
some observers suggesting that the process may have given birth 
to a genuine two-party system. 
  The significance of the Assembly elections in India was 
spelt 
out thus: "Hindu-Muslim tensions heated up with the December 
1992 destruction by Hindu nationalists of the historic mosque of 
Ayodhya, and riots which left hundreds dead. Tensions were 
further heightened by a bomb attack in downtown Bombay and the 
siege by Indian security forces of the sacred Hazratbal mosque 
in Kashmir, where Muslim militants had barricaded themselves. 
Those and other events led many to predict that Indian politics 
would become increasingly fractious and polarised by religious 
extremism. Instead, voters in India's recent elections largely 
rejected the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Hindu nationalist 
party. The election results were widely interpreted as a 
reaffirmation of India's status as a modern, secular State." 
  "In a positive move that was lauded by the United States and 
international organisations, the Indian Government agreed this 
year to allow human rights observers to enter Kashmir and 
investigate reports of abuses committed by New Delhi's security 
forces," the review said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--India today formally conveyed to 
Washington its strong feelings and concern over the U.S. 
President, Mr. Bill Clinton's references to Punjab in a letter 
to a Democratic Congressman. 
  The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, told the acting head 
of the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Kenneth Brill, that India could not but 
take a serious view of the contents of the letter, which were 
unacceptable and were seen as having a negative impact on 
bilateral relationship. Some of the points made by the Foreign 
Secretary were contained in the official reaction, given through 
the Foreign Office spokesman yesterday. 
  Mr. Brill, it is learnt, wanted India not to take seriously 
either the fact of despatch of the letter or its contents. This, 
according to him, was part of the job of the public 
communications division of the White House, which replied to 
letters in the President's name, received from the public. 
  India, it was clear, read a deeper meaning into the letter 
episode. 
<H5>  Downplaying issue </H5>
  C. Raja Mohan reports from Washington: 
  The reference to "Sikh rights" in the controversial letter 
written by Mr. Clinton does not imply that Washington is seeking 
special treatment for Sikhs in India, according to sources in 
the State Department. In an attempt to down play the 
significance of the letter, administration sources are 
suggesting that too much should not be read into it. They argue 
that the term "Sikh rights" must be understood as a broad 
reference to minority rights enshrined in the Indian 
Constitution. They point out that both the Indian and American 
Constitutions guarantee in a generic way the rights of all 
minorities. The sources assert that the United States does not 
support the creation of Khalistan. However, they are not ready 
to provide a satisfactory answer to the question why the term 
"minority rights" was not used in Mr. Clinton's letter 
expressing his desire for a "peaceful solution" in Punjab "that 
protests Sikh rights." 
  The reference to the Indian Constitution and the rights 
granted by it appears to be a new formulation to take the sting 
off the American intervention in India's internal affairs. In 
its earlier clarification on Mr. Clinton's letter to the leading 
campaigner here for the secession of Kashmir, Dr. Ghulam Nabi 
Fai, the State Department suggested that the administration was 
only calling on the Indian Government to respect the human 
rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. 
  The State Department sources suggest that the President is 
obliged to respond to the concerns expressed on human rights 
issues by Congressmen and the letter should be seen in that 
context. They note that Mr. Clinton had referred in his letter 
to the improvement of the ground reality in Punjab. They also 
suggest that the U.S. Government has repeatedly expressed its 
concerns on violations of human rights in Punjab to the Indian 
Government.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 23--While the "pro-lobbyists" have 
had their way, there is a sense of dissatisfaction at the 
highest levels in the Foreign Office over the decision to 
appoint a firm of lobbyists and image-builders in Washington to 
complement the role of the Indian Embassy in the United States. 
  Lobbying is an accepted way of life in America's democracy, 
and the institution is nearly as old as the signing of the 
Declaration of Independence 200 years old. Lobbying firms have 
proliferated in Washington over the years. For a price these 
seek to influence policy-makers, legislators and the media in 
favour of their clients. In the case of the Indian Embassy, the 
price is half a million dollars a year. 
  This could well represent a sum equal to or greater than the 
total salary bill of the embassy officials and staff, but that 
is not the reason for the sense of unease here. 
  The real reasons are possibly two: doubts about what 
lobbyists can actually achieve, especially when their goals are 
not clearly defined and may possibly even be difficult to lay 
down, and an appropriately perceived loss of prestige for the 
doubtlessly competitive Indian Foreign Service whose officers do 
not make less effective diplomats than the equivalent service of 
any other country, no matter how powerful or well-versed in the 
politics among nations. 
  India slipping in its own eyes?: It is perhaps for 
these very reasons that the idea of hiring lobbyists had been 
shot down before by the Government, and constitutes a 
controversial decision today. The idea did not take off even in 
the Eighties when Pakistan was playing havoc with the Indian 
image on both Punjab and Kashmir in the United States through 
its own hired lobbying firm. Ironically, the "pro-lobbyists" 
have won when only half that problem remains in the sense that 
the Punjab militancy is seen as being no longer a day-to-day 
nightmare. It needs to be noted that big, strong or influential 
nations do not have a record of hiring lobbyists in Washington. 
In that sense, going for one now may reflect India slipping in 
its own eyes. 
  Some of the P-4, i.e., the former USSR or now Russia, 
Britain, France and China (excluding for this discussion the 
United States among the Permanent Members of the Security 
Council, as lobbying is resorted to for a favourable impact 
inside America) are known to have used the services of lobbyists 
for specific, single assignments but never on a sustained basis 
with an omnibus brief, as appears to be the case with the hiring 
of the firm of Mcauliffe, Kelly and Rafaeilli by India. 
  Indeed, lobbying can achieve little if it is not in tandem 
with the broad perceptions of U.S. policy. It would no doubt be 
accepted even by the lobbyists for Pakistan, for instance, that 
they could not get their client off the hook on Pressler, even 
though Pakistan has had the ear of the U.S. establishment for 
four decades as a close associate in the ideological conflict 
against the former Soviet Union and was a certified "frontline 
State" while the war in Afghanistan lasted. 
  It is difficult to imagine, for instance, that even the most 
impressive lobbying effort could sell the case for Iraq, Libya, 
Cuba or North Korea in Washington, or, for that matter, Moscow, 
in its earlier incarnation. 
  In India's own case, shortly after independence when New 
Delhi was yet to be regarded as a "Soviet ally" by Washington, 
nothing that the powerful world personality of Nehru projected 
could persuade the United States to back the development of the 
public sector in this country, though both nations saw each 
other as civilised democracies. It is doubtful if lobbyists 
would have succeeded where Nehru had failed. 
  It would not be unfair to the American lobbyists to suggest 
that their most notable successes lie on the domestic agenda. 
Lobby firms make it a practice of donating funds to election 
campaigns of politicians, and this is a key strength in their 
dealings on Capital Hill. 
  Lobbyists (against India) also do well when constituencies 
of 
politicians include Khalistanis, PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] 
expatriates, or Pakistanis in useful numbers. But in the final 
analysis they work out best for an overseas client when American 
policy goals converge with the brief a lobbyist is handed. 
  It is not clear what brief India expects its lobbyist in 
Washington to handle. Is it the economy and the flow of private 
foreign capital and business? 
  Boot on other leg: The boot is on the other leg, 
really. Were the Americans themselves not lobbying India hard at 
the highest level for decades for a change in its economic 
structure so that U.S. business interest could be attracted? And 
when this did begin to happen, did American business not show a 
keen interest? That was well before a lobbyist was retained. 
  Can India realistically look to a lobbyist to get it past 
the 
U.S. establishment on NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], or the 
Kashmir question, or human rights, especially when these are 
centre-stage for policy-framers in Washington? Unfortunately, 
these cannot be achieved through hired retainers, but through 
national will, and skilful and augmented diplomacy. China 
presents a striking example of this. 
  Recent visitors from the United States have suggested that 
the American executive and the legislature are crowded with men 
and women who have spent time in this country as Peace Corps 
volunteers, and a large number of them still see India through 
friendly eyes. Has the embassy in Washington, for a start, even 
sought to tap a natural reservoir of goodwill such as this, 
before rushing into lobbies of the image-building industry?

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "Clinton Set-up Bent on Attacking </F>
India?"] 
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 23--The Clinton Administration 
appears determined to go out of the way to hit out at India on 
human rights issues. It is no longer possible to attribute the 
statements emanating from the White House on the situation in 
India to mere callousness and insensitivity. Only unremitting 
hostility, spurred by interested quarters, among the White House 
aides can explain the fact that the President, Mr. Bill Clinton, 
had signed two letters on the same day, December 27, that make 
provocative statements on two of the most sensitive issues 
relating to India's security. 
  Yesterday, Mr. Gurmit Singh Aulak, the self-proclaimed 
president of the Council of Khalistan based in Washington 
released a letter written by Mr. Clinton to the Congressman, Mr. 
Gary A. Condit. The letter said: "I am aware of the chronic 
tensions between the Indian Government and the Sikh militants, 
and share your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh 
rights." 
  Referring to the recent improvement in the ground situation 
in Punjab, the President talked of continuing police abuses in 
the State. He declared, "It is clear that abuses still occur, 
however, and we regularly raise our concerns about them with 
senior officials in the Punjab Government and the Indian 
Government." Stating that "human rights is an important issue in 
U.S.-India relations," the President assured Mr. Condit that 
Washington would "continue to make our concerns known to the New 
Delhi authorities." 
  Reevaluation of ties needed: Two weeks ago, Mr. 
Clinton's letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, an activist for the 
Kashmiri militants here, declaring his desire to "bring peace to 
Kashmir," had been publicised. It was possible to make light of 
that letter, seeing it as something that just slipped through 
the normally tight system in the White House that regulates 
presidential utterances on foreign policy issues. The fact that 
Mr. Clinton has now signed a nastier letter on Punjab to a 
Congressman must necessarily force reevaluation in New Delhi of 
the State of political relations between India and the United 
States. 
  It is no longer possible for New Delhi to downplay the 
significance of the Clinton letters. Until now, it could be 
argued that the Khalistan cause is being taken up only by a few 
Sikh militants, their lobbyists and Congressmen who are funded 
by them. The reference to Punjab now comes from the President 
himself, the highest authority of the executive branch of the 
U.S. Government. 
  It is necessary to recall that under the previous 
administration, despite a far graver situation in Punjab, the 
Sikh militants here could not get the President, Mr. George 
Bush, to endorse their cause. Now Mr. Clinton has done it when 
normality has returned to Punjab. That there is not a single 
reference to terrorism in either of Mr. Clinton's letters 
suggests that this administration does not even care to pretend 
there is some balance when it refers to the internal situation 
in India. 
  New Delhi has until now shown great restraint in reacting to 
the provocations from Washington. Such restraint and the 
attempts to sincerely engage American concerns on human rights 
have obviously no value.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Sees India as a Big </F>
Emerging Market"] 
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Clinton Administration 
continues to send mixed signals to India. Even as the White 
House puts out letters signed by the U.S. President, Mr. Bill 
Clinton, with remarks on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that 
are needlessly offensive to India, senior economic policy makers 
in the administration are pointing out the emerging economic 
opportunities in India and the absence of a political initiative 
in Washington to consolidate these opportunities. 
  The U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for International 
Trade, 
Mr. Jeffrey E. Garten has said that as the economic reform 
gathers momentum, India may be "in a position to provide 
significant commercial opportunities for U.S. firms throughout 
the 1990s. 
  Addressing the American Foreign Policy Association in New 
York late last week, Mr. Garten expressed the hope of the 
Clinton Administration to "develop a more regular, higher 
profile commercial policy dialogue with India in the future." 
  Larger strategic framework: Mr. Garten's reference 
to India was part of a larger strategic framework being 
developed by the U.S. Commerce Department to engage the "big 
emerging markets" (BEMs), such as China, Indonesia, South Korea, 
India, Turkey, South Africa, Poland, Argentina, Brazil and 
Mexico. Although Japan and Western Europe are likely to remain 
the biggest markets for the United States, Mr. Garten suggests 
that the "big emerging markets," hold--far more promise for 
large incremental gains in exports." He estimates that nearly 
three-fourths of the growth in world trade in the next two 
decades is likely to take place in the developing world--much of 
it occurring in the big emerging markets. The BEMs are likely to 
double their share in world GDP in that time, to 20 percent from 
today's 10 percent. By the year 2010, according to Mr. Garten, 
the share of the BEMs in world imports is likely to exceed that 
of Japan and the European Union combined. 
  Talking of the new commercial opportunities in India, Mr. 
Garten has urged the reinvigoration of "dormant U.S.-Indian 
Government-to-Government economic and commercial forums, and 
encourage the involvement of business groups." In a reference to 
the Indian expatriate community in the United States, Mr. Garten 
believes that the U.S. business community and the Government 
should find ways of working with them," whose familiarity and 
ties with India would be invaluable." The expanded Indo-U.S. 
commercial dialogue, according to Mr. Garten, should cover not 
only issues such as intellectual property rights, workers 
rights, and market access, but also procedures for export 
financing and export licensing. 
  The U.S. Commerce Department, which is laying the ground for 
a comprehensive commercial initiative towards the BEMs, believes 
that the advanced industrial nations may have to compete 
fiercely for a share of these markets. Mr. Garten notes that 
since the Indian economic reforms began, top European leaders 
have visited India to pursue enhanced commercial ties. He also 
records that the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
travelled to Germany, Japan, France, and South Korea with a 
"commercial agenda in hand." Mr. Garten notes that "America has 
been conspicuously absent from this flow." He insists "this must 
change." 
  The incipient American strategy towards the BEMs understands 
the need for "deft balancing" of commercial and foreign policy 
considerations. The close coexistence of commercial 
opportunities with the problems of "human rights, worker rights, 
nuclear non-proliferation, and violations of intellectual 
property rights," poses difficult policy dilemmas. Mr. Garten 
recognises the independent political aspirations of these 
countries, who "often effectively challenge U.S. policies in 
multi-lateral organisations, such as the IMF, GATT and the 
United Nations." 
  Voices beginning to be heard: The inability of the 
South Asia Bureau in the U.S. State Department to find that 
appropriate balance between different American interests in 
India that has brought the high expectations just a year ago on 
Indo-U.S. relations crashing down. It has been stuck with the 
tiresome agenda of human rights, preventive diplomacy on 
Kashmir, and non-proliferation, without any reference to the 
larger economic opportunities for the United States, that are 
emerging not only in India, but also in other parts of the 
Sub-Continent. The letter-writing from the White House has not 
helped either. But other voices in the Clinton administration, 
most notably the Commerce Department, are at least beginning to 
be heard. 
  It may be recalled that the announcement of the Prime 
Minister's visit to the United States early this year came from 
Ms. Joan Spero, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic and 
Agricultural Affairs. Ms. Spero was putting Mr. Rao's visit in 
the context of the new emphasis in Washington on economic 
diplomacy. It may yet be possible that the U.S. policy towards 
India could get a better balance, as the Clinton administration 
sorts out the current chaos in its foreign policymaking. 
  PTI reports from Delhi: 
  Additional access to Indian garments: The United 
States has agreed to accord additional access of about 40 
million square metres over and above the notional level of about 
500 million square metres for Indian garments in the current 
calendar year under the new Indo-U.S. textile agreement. 
  Both the countries signed an agreement on Saturday last in 
Washington, after three days of intense negotiations, an 
official release said today. 
  For other cotton made-ups, including hand-loom made-ups, an 
enhanced 115 percent had been provided, which is of the order of 
13 million square metres. 
  For pajamas and nightwears, gent's jackets, which were under 
unilateral specific limit have now been shifted to Group I with 
bilaterally agreed specific limit. Similarly, items under 
category 338/339 (cotton T-shirts), category 315 (twills), 
category 326 (satins) which were hitherto covered by Group II 
limit have also been shifted to Group I with specific limit. In 
the case of category 351/651 and category 334/634, improvement 
of 15 percent had been provided and in the case of 338/639, an 
uplift of 50 percent have been provided.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Harps on Human Rights </F>
Violation"] 
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Indian Ambassador to the 
United States, Mr. Siddharth Shankar Ray, has conveyed to the 
Clinton Administration, New Delhi's concern over the series of 
negative pronouncements on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that 
have emanated from the highest political level in Washington. 
The Ambassador yesterday told the Assistant Secretary of State 
for South Asian Affairs, Ms. Robin Raphel, of the larger 
negative impact of these statements on the bilateral relations. 
  India had instructed Mr. Ray to convey its unhappiness with 
the turn of events in Washington, in particular the recent 
letters of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to supporters 
of secessionist movement in Kashmir and Punjab. 
  U.S. deeply troubled: In a separate development, 
the Clinton Administration has informed the U.S. Congress that 
it is pressing India "to strengthen the recently formed Human 
Rights Commission, prosecute human rights violators, and allow 
access to Kashmir by human rights monitoring groups, 
particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross." 
Responding to concerns expressed in the U.S. Congress about 
human rights violations in Kashmir, the U.S. State Department 
has said that it is "deeply troubled" by the reports of human 
rights abuses in Kashmir, "both by Indian security forces and by 
militant groups." 
  In a letter to Mr. Tom Lantos, the chairman of the 
Congressional Human Rights Caucus, the Assistant Secretary of 
State for Legislative Affairs, Ms. Wendy R. Sherman, said the 
Clinton Administration had regularly raised human rights 
concerns with the Indian officials "as part of an intensified 
dialogue on human rights, urging them to bring an end to such 
abuses." The letter sent in late December was made available 
today to correspondents here. 
  Patronising tone: The formulations in the letter 
reflect attempts in the recent weeks by the State Department to 
make the administration's articulation of Kashmir policy less 
offensive. But it is well short of amounting to a fair position 
on the Kashmir issue. The positive reference to Indian 
democratic tradition is marred by the patronising tone of the 
letter: "India is a democratic State with the capacity to reform 
itself, and we will continue to encourage this process at every 
opportunity." 
  For once, the administration acknowledges, in the letter to 
Mr. Lantos, the linkage between the insurgency and the human 
rights situation in Kashmir and it notes that Washington has 
"urged all parties involved to resolve their differences 
peacefully and abstain from violence." But by equating the 
responsibility of the Indian State to restore law and order and 
protect innocent citizens from the ravages of militancy in 
Kashmir with the terrorist violence sponsored by Pakistan, the 
formulation slips into the by now familiar diplomatic sleight of 
hand. 
  Standard formulation: The letter from the State 
Department also reiterates the now standard American formulation 
on resolving the Kashmir problem: "We believe the resolution of 
the Kashmir problem can be best achieved through negotiations 
between India and Pakistan, taking into account the wishes of 
the people of Kashmir." The State Department has clarified in 
the recent past that the reference to the wishes of the people 
of Kashmir, does not imply a support to the notion of the 
self-determination, it is only a recognition of the practical 
necessity of making any Indo-Pakistan agreement on Kashmir 
acceptable to the people of Kashmir. 
  The administration also indicated that it does not favour 
the 
plebiscite or any other particular procedure for ascertaining 
the wishes of the Kashmiri people. It suggested that the 
procedure could be decided within the framework of Indo-Pakistan 
negotiations. These verbal gymnastics, however, do not obfuscate 
the fact that the Clinton administration has gone far beyond the 
fair position outlined by the Bush administration in 1990 
favouring the Simla agreement as the means of resolving the 
Indo-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir. Nor does it hide the 
ill-advised posture of activism and intervention in Kashmir 
adopted by the Clinton administration. 
  Washington is also yet to recognise that its activism has 
complicated the Indian efforts to initiate a political process 
in Jammu and Kashmir. The American rhetoric on human rights and 
Kashmir along with signals of White House support for 
secessionist groups has generated strong illusions among the 
militants in Kashmir and the political establishment in Pakistan 
that Washington will be able to deliver through international 
diplomatic action, what they have not been able to achieve on 
the battlefield. 
  Kashmiri Pandits' plea: The lack of balance in the 
Clinton Administration's position on Kashmir was the main theme 
that a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits based in the United States 
sought to present Ms. Robin Raphel, who saw them yesterday. The 
group from the Indo-American Kashmir Forum [IAKF] drew the 
attention of the State Department to the plight of their 
community, and called on the United States to take a more 
even-handed approach to the Kashmir problem. They also told Ms. 
Raphel that "any tilt or even the perception of a tilt towards 
one party or the other will effectively erode the role the 
United States can play and should play in resolving the Kashmir 
problem." 
  The group of Kashmiri Pandits, who support the creation of a 
Union territory within the Kashmir valley for their community, 
have called on the United States "to publicly identify Kashmir 
Pandits as a party to the dispute and settlement in Kashmir." In 
a press conference yesterday, the IAKF said Ms. Raphel assured 
them that the U.S. is fully aware of the complexity of the 
Kashmir issue, and has no intention of being one-sided in its 
approach. The IAKF is also intensifying the efforts of the 
Kashmiri Pandits in the United States to present their case to 
the Congressmen and familiarise them with the dimensions of the 
Kashmir problem that have been barely noticed, let alone 
understood in the United States. 
  To the extent that the complexity of the Kashmir problem can 
be brought before the American public such lobbying effort may 
have some value. But it will be tragic if different sections of 
the people of Jammu and Kashmir begin to believe in the illusion 
that the road to peace in Kashmir runs through Washington. 
Neither the letter writing by Mr. Clinton, nor the human rights 
cacophony from the U.S. Congress can bring peace to Kashmir. It 
has not so far in Bosnia. Only a democratic political process 
within the framework of the Indian Union can restore peace and 
tranquillity to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
<H5>  Congressmen's assurance </H5>
  UNI, PTI report: 
  Meanwhile, the Republican Party Congressmen--Mr. Jim Ramstad 
and Mr. Rodney Grams--have agreed to take up the Pandits' case 
and promised to help arrange a special Congressional hearing to 
highlight their plight.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Pakistan Terms for Talks </F>
Rejected"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 19--India today rejected--in 
forceful, categorical terms--Pakistan's suggestion for the 
future bilateral talks focussing on "modalities for the holding 
of plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir [J &amp; K]." Pakistan's plea 
contained in a non-paper given to the Indian High Commissioner 
in Islamabad yesterday, was seen as a restatement of the 
pre-conditions for continuing the dialogue, raised at the 
foreign secretary-level talks earlier this month. 
  India, however, reiterated its readiness to discuss with 
Pakistan all issues pertaining to bilateral relations in 
accordance with the commitments and mutual obligations of the 
two countries under the Shimla Agreement. 
  In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesman here dealt with 
the plebiscite issue thus: "India categorically states once 
again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The 
question or the need for conducting any plebiscite in any part 
of India including in the State of Jammu and Kashmir simply does 
not arise. The people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir have 
exercised their democratic rights repeatedly as people in other 
parts of India, unlike the case in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and 
what Pakistan has labelled as `Northern Areas'. 
  Apart from plebiscite modalities, Pakistan, in another 
non-paper, dealt with "measures required to create a propitious 
climate for peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute 
and other issues." The Indian statement regretted that Pakistan 
was attempting "through their propaganda exercise to obfuscate 
the realities of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  India drew attention to three points. One, the violence in 
Jammu and Kashmir was being perpetrated with the connivance and 
active support of Pakistan. Two, the government had the will and 
commitment to counter terrorism, while continuing efforts to 
enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their 
democratic rights. Three, the level of security forces deployed 
in the State corresponded to the level of violence created by 
the militants; cross-border terrorism was a major concern of the 
government and a hurdle in India-Pakistan relations. 
  Pak. support to militants: Dealing with Pakistan's 
involvement in terrorist violence, the statement said: "There is 
a climate of violence in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir 
have had to live through in the recent period. This violence is 
being generated by militants and foreign mercenaries who have 
been trained and equipped on Pakistani soil and who have 
infiltrated into India with the connivance and active support 
of Pakistan, with the sole objective of eroding the territorial 
integrity and political stability of India. We have repeatedly 
called upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring trans-border 
terrorism which contravenes the very basic norms of inter-State 
conduct and good-neighbourly relations." 
  The resolve to counter the designs of militants was 
reiterated in the following words: "While the Government's 
endeavour continues to be to provide full opportunities for the 
people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their democratic rights 
and no efforts which could lead to this process is out of 
consideration, we will not spare any effort to oppose any moves 
directed against the country's unity and territorial integrity. 
Pakistan should not have any doubt whatsoever on this score." 
  Setback in talks: The process, set in motion by 
the talks by the two foreign secretaries, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and 
Mr. Shahryar Khan, suffered a setback, as a result of Pakistan's 
stand, as conveyed through the non-papers. The copies of the two 
documents were given to Mr. Dixit by the Pakistan High 
Commissioner here, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, yesterday. The first 
reaction of Mr. Dixit was reflected by a query regarding 
Pakistan's intentions. The contents of the Pakistani non-papers 
served to harden India's stand. This was evident, apart from the 
tone of today's statement, by the absence of any reference to 
the six proposals, intended to be submitted by India to give a 
positive twist to bilateral ties. 
  According to Pakistani sources, the door for negotiations 
had 
not been closed and that Islamabad continued to be interested in 
a dialogue and wanted the environments to be improved for this 
purpose. Pakistan, perhaps, would like the Kashmiri leaders like 
Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Gilani to be released to 
create proper atmosphere. 
  At the Islambad meeting, the initiative was with India, as 
Mr. Dixit promised to submit proposals on six subjects including 
nuclear non-proliferation, other confidence-building measures 
[CBM], stabilisation of the Line of Control [LoC] in Jammu and 
Kashmir. The rationale was clear--that the two sides try to 
foster confidence and mutual trust, as they engage themselves in 
substantive discussions on Jammu and Kashmir. Because of the 
sensitive nature of these subjects, there was no escape from 
intensive internal discussions by the External Affairs Ministry 
and other concerned ministries. This exercise took time, but the 
package was getting a final shape. On nuclear nonproliferation, 
for instance, India intended proposing expansion of the existing 
treaty on non-attack on nuclear facilities, with a provision, 
among other things, for observers to watch the functioning of 
nuclear reactors in the two countries. The two non-papers, 
perhaps, represented Pakistan's bid to wrest the initiative from 
India. 
  It would be a pity if the advance, represented by the 
newly-resumed dialogue, was allowed to peter out. It was worth 
preserving and building upon. Despite harsh words, the two sides 
had not given up the path of negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Six Proposals Submitted to </F>
Pakistan"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--Keeping up its initiative, India 
today conveyed to Pakistan the promised proposals on six 
sensitive subjects, including Siachen, stabilisation of the Line 
of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, and confidence-building 
measures in the nuclear field, as part of a normal, practical 
approach intended to be adopted in the bilateral field. 
  The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, handed over six 
non-papers containing the proposals to the Pakistan High 
Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, this evening. India, Mr. Dixit 
told the High Commissioner, had structured these proposals after 
serious deliberations and the initiative was neither empty 
propaganda nor an attempt to lay pre-conditions for continuing 
the dialogue. 
  The other subjects covered by the non-papers are: Sir Creek 
and delimitation of the maritime boundary, Tulbul navigation 
project and activation of the committees, set up within the 
framework of the Joint Commission, in July 1989 at Islamabad. 
India was represented at the Joint Commission meeting, which 
followed the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi's visit to 
Pakistan, by Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then External Affairs 
Minister. 
  The nuclear continental ballistic missile, contained in 
today's proposals, envisage extension of the existing agreement 
on non-attack at each other's nuclear facilities to cover 
non-attack on population centres and economic targets and to 
provide for non-first use of nuclear capabilities. 
  This was a small step in the bilateral context but there was 
nothing to preclude its extension to cover other countries which 
might choose to adhere to these provisions. 
  To ensure effective communication especially at times of 
crises, India suggested conversion of the present hotline 
between the Directors-General of Military Operations into a 
secure and dedicated link, coupled with fax facilities. 
  Siachen: As regards Siachen, India re-conveyed its 
willingness to accept the agreement reached in 1992 (which could 
not be implemented because of technical wrangles). Under it, 
both sides were to disengage from authenticated positions held 
presently, and leave the delimitation of the Line of Control 
beyond NJ 9842 to a joint commission. The immediate objective 
was to ensure peace and tranquillity in the area without 
prejudice to each other's positions. 
  `A positive signal': Today's formulation on 
Siachen was, perhaps, not different from the one agreed upon by 
the Defence Secretaries of the two countries towards the end of 
1992. India's acceptance of that agreement now was seen as a 
positive signal which was not possible then because of the 
domestic political situation. Pakistan did not want the "Actual 
Ground Positions Line" (AGPL) to be mentioned in any document 
lest India should use it in support of its claim to hold the 
territory acquired "through aggression." It should be possible 
to get over this objection, so goes the Indian argument, by 
inserting the words "without prejudice to each other's 
positions." 
  India occupied all the commanding heights along what, 
according to it, should be the Line of Control--along the 
Saltaro ridge, following the internationally-accepted watershed 
principle for delineating boundaries. The area was relatively 
quiet, with the cases of firing on the decline. India would like 
Pakistan to appreciate the significance of New Delhi's 
gesture--made at a time when it had a decisive advantage. 
  LoC in J &amp; K: Perhaps, the most comprehensive was 
the non-paper on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the 
Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. It was virtually a 
full-fledged draft agreement, with its ten clauses dealing with 
all aspects--violation of the line, trans-border infiltration 
and the like. It followed the format of the Sino-Indian 
arrangement for a tension-free border but was firmer and 
clearer. That was because, contrary to the Sino-Indian border, 
the two sides do not differ on how the Line of Control runs in 
Jammu and Kashmir. This proposal also envisaged an institutional 
mechanism to monitor and suitably deal with cases of violation 
of the agreed steps. That mechanism could also be used to ensure 
compliance with the provisions of the existing agreements, like 
the one on the prior notice of the movement of troops in the 
border areas (which, in actual practices, had not been fully 
adhered to). 
  The Sir Creek imbroglio was sought to be resolved by 
separating its two components--the border on the ground, which 
could be resolved later, and maritime boundary, for which a 
detailed delineation formula had been spelt out. 
  No reference to forces: There was no reference to 
re-deployment or reduction of forces along the LoC in Jammu and 
Kashmir, as demanded by Pakistan. According to the oft-explained 
Indian stand, the force level would be in proportion to the 
degree of infiltration or interference from the other side. By 
implications, India could discuss re-deployment in case of 
decline in the activities against its territorial integrity. 
  While the proposals on Siachen and Sir Creek, were, more or 
less, on the lines already agreed upon, the formulation on other 
issues, according to officials, marked a forward movement by 
India. That was particularly the case in regard to the nuclear 
CBMs. India could not compromise on its opposition to the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty nor accept the proposal for a 
five-nation conference for a nuclear-free South Asia, as 
suggested by the United States. Subject to these reservations, 
it had offered non-proliferation steps in the bilateral 
context--in keeping with the concerns mentioned during its 
dialogues with industrialised countries. But there was nothing 
to suggest that India would accept the "capping, freezing and 
rolling back" sequence suggested by the United States and others 
in regard to its nuclear capabilities.

<F P=106> [Article by P.S. Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Still Cool to </F>
India's Proposals"] 
  [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 26--Pakistan today expressed 
"disappointment" that India's latest proposals, aimed at taking 
the bilateral process of dialogue forward, "do not address what 
we (Pakistanis) regard as the fundamental and core problems in 
Kashmir." 
  Outlining their "immediate reaction" to, and "preliminary 
views" on these proposals, the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Mr. 
Shahryar M. Khan, told reporters here that India's "non-papers" 
on as many as six separate issues "miss the point" at stake, 
"beg the question" in focus or merely "address the peripheral" 
aspects of the primary issues. 
  Making it clear that Pakistan would express its "considered" 
comments on the proposals, Mr. Shahryar Khan said "none of these 
non-papers, in our preliminary view, really goes to the depth of 
the two crucial issues" regarding which Islamabad had recently 
made its own proposals. These related to the modalities of 
holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir and "visible steps to 
stop (India's alleged) repression and human rights violations" 
there. 
  It was within these Pakistani norms of judgment that Mr. 
Shahryar Khan saw India's proposal on converting the line of 
control in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of peace and 
tranquillity as suggestion for "a kind of mechanical agreement 
which would seem to be missing the point" that India was, in 
mooting this formula, "virtually asking us to accept the status 
quo on the line of control." Pakistan had already "indicated 
that this is not acceptable to it," he said. 
  Real reason for tension: "The real reason for 
tension along the line of control," which India was now seeking 
to address, was its "repression" in Jammu and Kashmir, he said. 
India should take cognisance of this linkage, he argued, but 
indicated that Pakistan would, nevertheless, undertake "a 
careful consideration" of the proposal regarding the line of 
control and "react some time later." 
  On the proposal regarding a bilateral ban on the first 
resort 
to a nuclear-weapons strike against each other, he said: "This 
proposal, in our view, begs the question. We are not nuclear 
powers. To have an agreement not to strike first is a basic 
contradiction in terms." 
  Dismissing this proposal as an exercise at window-dressing 
and an essentially "peripheral" aspect of the relations between 
the two countries, he said India was silent on crucial issues 
such as "the control of weapons of mass destruction, or the 
control of ballistic missiles being manufactured indigenously in 
India or the control of fissile materials being produced." The 
proposal "does not come to grips with the real issue of regional 
non-proliferation," he said. 
  No contradiction: Asked why Pakistan should shoot 
down the proposal for a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike, 
especially in the context of Islamabad's concern regarding the 
need to control India's production of fissile materials and 
indigenous ballistic missiles, Mr. Shahryar Khan said: "There is 
no contradiction." While, according to him, the proposal was 
based on the assumption that Pakistan was in possession of 
nuclear weapons, Islamabad's concern regarding "other issues 
such as fissile materials and ballistic missiles" should be seen 
in the context of "preventing (India) getting there," meaning 
the acquisition of a nuclear arms delivery system. 
  To a question whether Islamabad's views against an 
Indo-Pakistan ban on a nuclear first-strike did not reflect his 
own assumption that both countries were not nuclear powers, he 
said: "India has exploded a nuclear device (in 1974). Its 
capability is a matter of conjecture." 
  At this point, the official spokesman, who was also present, 
intervened to say that Pakistan had not exploded any nuclear 
device and that India's proposal was founded on "a presumption" 
that Pakistan was a nuclear power. What would be, however, 
acceptable to Pakistan, the spokesman indicated, was any 
proposal implying a unilateral commitment by India to desist 
from a nuclear first-strike against them in these circumstances. 
  "Only an Update": Mr. Shahryar Khan, referring to 
what he described as India's proposals on "technical issues" 
relating to the Siachen, Sir Creek and Wular barrage questions, 
said India had merely presented "an update on the state of 
negotiations." Even in this sense, the "non-papers" in this 
regard were not reflective of the "consensus" already reached by 
the two sides. The "points at which the bilateral negotiations 
were left off (on these issues) have not been accurately 
reflected," he said. He also said Pakistan would study these and 
other proposals seriously, despite Islamabad's view that India 
might have presently tried to draw a red herring of proposals 
across the tracks of the international community to "deflect and 
divert attention" away from the core issue of Kashmir's 
political status. 
  While Pakistan's initial reaction might suggest that it 
finds 
itself in no position to reject the proposals outright, 
diplomatic sources here said the reason could be traced to 
India's exercise at presenting Islamabad with draft agreements 
in certain respects. 
  The sources draw attention to the proposals regarding peace 
and tranquillity on the line of control. It is said that India's 
prescription of maintaining peace "without prejudice to the 
known positions of the two countries" on the fundamental Kashmir 
issue can be seen as a draft accord which would not transform 
the existing line of control into a de jure boundary 
between the two countries. 
  On the proposals regarding confidence-building measures, 
including a bilateral ban on a nuclear first-strike, the sources 
said Pakistan's willingness to consider them, despite its 
reservation regarding the nuclear-security status of India, 
could perhaps be seen in the context of India's parallel 
suggestions forbidding each side from launching a conventional 
attack on the other's economic targets and population centres. 
  As for "the technical issues," India had suggested 
"immediate 
talks" on the Siachen issue in the light of its "specific" 
ground details regarding disengagement and redeployment of 
troops on either side. On the Sir Creek issue, it had outlined 
the "principles" of a possible agreement, while the technical 
draft of an agreement on Tulbul had also been presented.

  [Text] Jammu, Jan. 25 (UNI)--Pakistani troops fired five 
rockets fitted with time bombs in Poonch areas bordering 
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on Tuesday. 
  Official reports here said two rockets fell in Betar Nullah 
on the outskirts of Poonch town and three exploded at two 
different places around the positions of security forces. 
However, there was no casualty. 
  The firing of time bombs with rockets is a new phenomenon in 
the Poonch-Rajouri areas near the Line of Control. Experts say 
that time bombs are thrown with rockets having solar batteries 
which are charged by sun. The bombs explode at fixed time. 
  Since last week in Poonch-Rajouri areas, about 45 such 
rocket 
bombs exploded at various places. But these did not cause any 
casualty as almost all of these rocket bombs landed in deserted 
areas. 
  The Governor, Gen. (Retd) K.V. Krishna Rao, on Tuesday 
accused Pakistan of actively aiding and abetting terrorism in 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  In his message to people on the eve of Republic Day, Gen. 
Krishna Rao said that Pakistan and militant outfits have been 
propagating merger of the State with Pakistan or independence, 
which were illusory objectives. 
  He said that Pakistan has not only instigated, trained and 
armed the Kashmiri youth to indulge in subversion and sabotage. 
  The Governor has ordered the release of 167 detenues on the 
eve of Republic Day, while the security forces apprehended 20 
militants in the Valley during the period, an official spokesman 
said. 
  Meanwhile, intermittent firing by Pakistani troops at Indian 
posts in forward areas near the Line of Control continued. Three 
civilians were injured in the firing during the past week. 
  Two people were injured in Poonch district and one in the 
Chamb sector of Jammu district on Monday, when Pakistani troops 
fired from across the Line of Control. 
  Security forces have stepped up vigil along the Line of 
Control following reports that Pakistan's Inter-Services 
Intelligence (ISI) has planned massive infiltration of Afghan 
mercenaries who are trained in guerilla warfare and subversive 
activities. 
  The security forces have successfully foiled another attempt 
of Pakistani troops to push fresh groups of militants into 
Poonch and Rajouri areas for escalation of violence in the State. 
  Srinagar: A red alert has been sounded in the 
Kashmir Valley in view of the militant threat to disrupt the 
Republic Day functions, while two militants and a security 
personnel were among 10 people killed during the past 24 hours. 
  Militants lobbed a hand-grenade on a Border Security Force 
(BSF) guard at Chadoora bridge injuring three personnel, one of 
them died in the Army Hospital. 
  One militant was killed in an encounter with the security 
forces during search operations. Two more militants were nabbed 
and arms and ammunition, including two AK 56 rifles, one 
universal machine gun, one rocket were recovered. 
  Meanwhile, day curfew in Kishtwar town of Doda district in 
the Jammu region was lifted on Tuesday following improvement in 
the overall situation. 
  Curfew was imposed on Saturday last following the killing of 
two people by militants in Dool area, which had caused tension 
in Kishtwar and other adjoining areas.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan 12 (PTI)--India and Bangladesh today 
agreed to delineate 50 km of their undemarcated border at the 
earliest. 
  This was the major outcome of the Indo-Bangladesh 
coordination meeting at the level of the director-general of the 
Border Security Force [BSE]. 
  However, no significant progress was reported on the dispute 
in the Muhurichar area. 
  A press release issued by the BSE said the surveyors general 
of the two countries would now be asked to take up the job of 
demarcation of the 50-km stretch of the border. 
  On the dispute in the Muhurichar area, India took the stand 
that on the basis of the Indo-Bangladesh agreement of 1974, the 
boundary in the area ran along the course of the Muhuri River. 
  The Bangladesh delegation insisted that cultivation on the 
Indian side should be stopped. 
  The Indian side reiterate that the agreement between the two 
countries related to the alignment of the border and not 
utilisation of land on either side. It was nevertheless, agreed 
that the security forces of both sides should exercise utmost 
restraint in the area. 
  The two sides agreed that the repair work and maintenance of 
boundary pillars along the international border should be taken 
over by their security forces.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 25--A visiting Japanese Minister, 
Mr. Shozo Azuma, today surprised his hosts by adopting positions 
on key political issues of concern to this country that can only 
be described as unthinking, uninformed, and shorn of nuances and 
complexities. 
  The Japanese Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, 
the counterpart of a Minister of State here, is the first 
Minister from his country to come here after the Prime Minister, 
Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, went to Tokyo two years ago. 
  Considering this, his rough-edged articulations on major 
political questions raised eyebrows even higher as these were 
accompanied by constant references to Japan's Overseas 
Development Assistance (ODA) Charter which stipulates that 
Japanese aid should be related to the level of arms expenditure 
of the recipient country, proscribing of weapons of mass 
destruction, conforming to (west-defined) human rights, and 
adherence to the market economy. 
  These are known principles and were ratified by Japanese 
Parliament two years ago. It is their juxtaposition with a 
prickly presentation on sensitive issues straight out of a 
written-down, prepared brief that tended to cause dismay here. 
  The surprise caused by Mr. Azuma's understanding of key 
issues like the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Kashmir, 
human rights, missile proliferation and India-Pakistan 
relations--on each of which this country is engaged in delicate 
and difficult dialogue with the United States other major 
powers, as well as Pakistan--was all the greater as only eight 
days ago in Tokyo, Japan had adopted a restrained approach on 
these questions during the India-Japan bilateral talks on 
nuclear and disarmament issues. 
  The External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, is reported 
to have done some plain speaking, reminding Mr. Azuma that Japan 
had been a victim of nuclear attack. As such, it occasioned 
surprise to see a Minister from that country taking a position 
that permits nuclear weapons to be institutionalised in the 
hands of a few countries while denying it to others. 
  Mr. Singh is also believed to have displayed some impatience 
with Mr. Azuma's presentation on the Kashmir question. Official 
circles suggest that the visiting Minister was informally told 
that if Japan accepted the position that people's wishes should 
be ascertained in Kashmir--euphemism for plebiscite that 
Pakistan has now begun talking about stridently--it should be 
prepared for a similar exercise in the Northern Territories that 
lie in dispute between Japan and Russia. In that event the 
region was most likely to lapse to Japan's neighbour to the 
north. 
  Of course, a section of the officialdom took the charitable 
view that Mr. Azuma was a first-time Minister not quite familiar 
with the ground on which he chose to tread. 
  The Japanese Minister arrived here for three days yesterday 
on the last swing of a goodwill tour of nine countries in Africa 
and Asia, including Nepal and Pakistan. Today he called on the 
President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the Finance Minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, besides the External Affairs Minister. 
  Interestingly, he preferred to dwell more on politics than 
economics even in his meeting with the Finance Minister. During 
his several meetings he was informed of India's latest 
discussions, and detailed offer of talks, with Pakistan. At the 
end of it, it is understood he appreciated the complexity of the 
situation, sources noted.

<F P=106> [Article by Arun Nehru: "The Challenges Ahead"] </F>
  [Text] In a few days the new year will commence and with it 
there will be new challenges and opportunities. We are a nation 
of 900 million people, living in an age where unprecedented 
changes have taken place and like other large populated 
countries such as China we have to find the "Indian remedy" to 
play a more meaningful part in global affairs. The last few 
years have been traumatic and the changes, both political and 
economic, in the global order mean a realistic change in our 
political and economic thinking. It would be fatal to delink the 
two or to think that we can take an isolated stand on global 
issues. There are no simplistic solutions, no magic formulae; 
hard assessments and firm decisions will be necessary. 
  The break-up of the Soviet Union, the winds of change in 
Eastern Europe to a democratic system, the growing problems and 
the great economic hardship in Cuba and North Korea, the 
emergence of the United States as the sole superpower, must 
necessarily mean new political alignments. There are no premiums 
on conflicts, and it should be no surprise that peace, economic 
development and prosperity will be the challenges of the future. 
We have peace in South Africa. Both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Nelson 
Mandela richly deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. We have peace in 
West Asia, the PLO and Israel, North and South Korea are 
talking; the British Government is looking towards the end of 
the conflict in Ireland. 
  On the economic front we have witnessed the emergence of 
large trading blocs. The United States, Canada and Mexico have 
taken a significant step forward on NAFTA (North American Free 
Trade Agreement). The European concept of a single entity is 
slowly but surely becoming a reality. Japan and the Pacific rim 
are becoming areas of high growth and prosperity. China has 
emerged as a major economic power. At the same time cyclic 
changes and a "peaceful environment" have created a recession in 
the developed nations. The economic chaos in Russia and the new 
States, the monetary crisis in Eastern Europe, the perilous 
situation in Africa, and the Third World living on borrowed 
funds, are all looking for better days. All economic indicators 
are showing that the future lies in Asia--the Chinese economy is 
booming, so is Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Japan despite 
a recession continues to generate record surpluses. In a 
difficult situation it is only natural that economic reform and 
the dismantling of controls will be the objective of the 
developing reforms. Investigation in the current recession will 
only flow to high growth areas. The U.S. President, Mr. 
Clinton's success on NAFTA made it almost certain that the 
agreement on GATT would follow and despite the usual 
brinkmanship to satisfy local political pressures, the agreement 
was signed. The Third World will sadly suffer and suffer because 
its economic clout is minimal. In the future there will be 
furious competition to draw investments from financial 
institutions and countries. India will compete with the others 
for its share and it will not be easy. 
  India's relevance as a political power and an economic 
entity 
is being closely monitored by the global community and future 
success and failure will largely be determined by our own 
internal strength and achievement. Self-reliance was the slogan 
and the driving point of Panditji's policy and it is with 
gratitude that we must acknowledge that the cumulative wisdom of 
our past leaders has provided us with the infrastructure to deal 
with the future not only in terms of industrial capacity but 
also in the creation of the world's third largest technical 
manpower. Comparisons are unfair, but perhaps it would be 
relevant to mention that China has never indulged in 
vilification of its past. The reform process did not follow the 
World Bank manual but rather relied on a "local formula" for 
implementation. The world today is seeking China both for 
investment and trading. China with its population and industrial 
growth will be one of the largest consuming countries for a 
variety of products. The key factor in its success was that 
reforms benefited the vast majority of its population. 
  The world and the business community look towards India for 
political stability for its existing Government and more 
important for a continuation of its democratic structure. 
Military dictatorships and totalitarian regimes have a tendency 
to give an impression of firmness and stability, but in the long 
term tend to degenerate into a chaotic and uncertain future. The 
past decade in India has not been an easy one. We have witnessed 
two tragic assassinations. We have seen the forces of caste and 
religion dominate our electoral stage. We have witnessed serious 
law and order situations. We have seen four Governments come and 
go. We have survived all these traumas and it is to the credit 
of our people that they have continuously reaffirmed their 
adherence to democratic institutions and to a secular future. 
  To predict national trends for the general elections on the 
basis of current election results will require the services of 
an eminent astrologer. The possibility of mid-term elections is 
now no longer a reality after the recent events. The 
Congress(I), generally expected to do little, won handsomely in 
Madhya Pradesh and Himachal. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] 
after the dismissal of its Government was expected to retain the 
States where it was in power and it was tactically natural for 
it to fight a high profile election and advance its claims for 
the general elections. The loss in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal 
was a disaster, but the failure to form a Government in Uttar 
Pradesh, was calamitous. In Rajasthan it barely won. The Delhi 
victory was spectacular. The Janata Dal predictably simply 
ceased to exist. 
  On the surface the Congress(I) and the Prime Minister are 
the 
big winners. The BJP has suffered a serious setback, and the 
Janata Dal is hurting towards self destruction. The regional 
forces gaining firm roots in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, the 
North-East, Bihar and Orissa have made a historic gain with 
Uttar Pradesh and Mr. Mulayam Singh. Between 1994 and the 
general elections there will be State elections in Andhra 
Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar. To predict winners and losers at 
this stage would be presumptuous. The policy initiatives however 
cannot be put off as a strategy for the future must evolve. 
  The Congress(I) and the Prime Minister will have to 
determine 
if the party is strong enough to emerge with a simple majority. 
Both in 1989 and 1991 the dismal results in Uttar Pradesh and 
Bihar denied the party the success it sought and the position 
there now is perilous. An alliance with Mr. Mulayam Singh or Mr. 
Lallu Yadav may work in the short term but the future 
implications could be catastrophic. Ram Manohar Lohia prevailing 
over the Nehruvian concept could have a snow-balling effect. The 
Congress traditionally looks to the future. The Congress(I) 
became the Congress(R) when Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister 
and now it is Congress (PVNR) [P.V. Narasimha Rao]. Sheer logic 
indicates that the Prime Minister would have to pursue an 
independent course of action if he is to lead the party in 1996 
and avoid dissident activity in the immediate future. The 
failure in Uttar Pradesh cannot be attributed to the Prime 
Minister, but the coming Andhra Assembly elections will be a key 
factor in determining his capacity to lead. 
  The Janata Dal will claim all-India status but is primarily 
confined to Orissa and Bihar, both States run by charismatic 
leaders who will now ponder over their future course of action. 
The party has ceased to exist in Uttar Pradesh and in the coming 
months the party or what is left of it will continue to 
splinter. Mr. Ajit Singh may once again decide to support the 
Congress(I) in a "principled" stand. The National Front has a 
bleak future but NTR [N.T. Rama Rao] in Andhra, Mr. Biju Patnaik 
in Orissa, Mr. Lallu Yadav in Bihar have a strong regional base 
and will naturally protect their interests. Fortunately the 
projected caste war has not come about and as the BJP may 
realise governance is the key issue. Caste and religion in their 
ugliest proportions have created a limited following. But the 
vast majority of the electorate have opted for governance and in 
Uttar Pradesh where the decline, almost total eclipse of the 
Congress(I) and the Janata Dal has given limited opportunities, 
the results have been splintered. The biggest State with 85 
seats has gone into a state of uncertainty. 
  The new year is coming and with it must come the optimism of 
a better and brighter future. The future rests with all of us. 
We are a nation of 900 millions. We have the ability. We have 
the talent. We have the determination and will to succeed. The 
cumulative wisdom of India does not lie in the Cabinet or in the 
hands of the few. Everyone has a single vote and it is this 
power that determines victory and defeat. Victory cannot lie in 
the twin evils of caste and religion. The lessons of history 
indicate that we were enslaved for a thousand years because of 
these contradictions. There can be no future for India unless 
there is economic prosperity and growth. These are the global 
issues and challenges and it is to this direction that we must 
channel our vast reservoirs of talent.

  [Text] Bangalore, January 14--The election commission is 
considering a proposal to limit the number of observers and 
agents at the polling booths and counting centres to minimise 
chances of malpractice, the chief election commissioner, Mr T.N. 
Seshan, said. 
  Mr Seshan, who began the first of the meetings of regional 
electoral officers here yesterday, in anticipation of elections 
due at the end of this year, told reporters that barring the 
national parties, observers and agents would be allowed into the 
booths by rotation and only 10 to 15 percent of the agents of 
independent candidates would be permitted at a time. The 
presence of a large number of persons when the officials were 
involved in the nitty-gritty of elections would only be an 
unnecessary diversion, Mr Seshan said. 
  The meeting also had on the agenda measures to restrict the 
"manipulative, muscle and money power of privileged contestants 
that could affect the prospects of other candidates." This 
included controlling excessive and ostentatious expenditure and 
restricting the issue of facilities to the election staff to 
keep dummy candidates and other irritants at bay. 
  There would also be a bar on ministers and candidates 
attending official meetings and any meetings that could 
influence the officials, as this would only divert attention of 
the staff during the elections. 
  Mr Seshan was firm on the issue of the photo-identity cards 
to voters and said he would brook no excuses from any state 
government on that. If some state governments complained that 
they could not afford to spend Rs 100 crores on the cards, his 
stock answer was, "democracy doesn't come cheap." The deadline 
for completing the process of issuing identity cards is January 
1, 1995. There would be no elections in states where this 
process is not completed by then, he reiterated. 
  The process of issuing the cards had been "deliberately" 
decentralised, and besides the identity and other details of the 
voter, the card would sport a laser hologram of the state symbol 
to distinguish the card. The card would be as complete as 
possible, but the ultimate responsibility of ensuring that the 
entries were correct was on the voter himself. 
  On the restriction of the number of vehicles and security 
provided to candidates, Mr Seshan clarified that it was subject 
to the needs of the security of the candidate concerned. 
Restricting the number of candidates to accommodate the 
"privileged" ones was no solution, and the election commission 
generally proceeded on the assumption that all candidates were 
serious candidates. The idea was to convey to the people the 
seriousness involved in the conduct of elections, he added. 
  No decision has yet been taken on the use of electronic 
voting machines, since the government was not in a position to 
expend Rs 1,000 crores over three years to deploy them 
nationwide. Besides, the machines have several limitations, 
which could not be taken care of in the available time. 
  The southern meeting was to be followed by those of the 
other 
five regions, including the central, northern, western, eastern 
and north-eastern regions in the coming weeks. The agenda for 
all these would be the same. 
  Programmes to increase voter-awareness, and all measures to 
minimise violation of election norms were also considered at the 
meeting. Asked about the measures to deal with election-day eve 
malpractices, Mr Seshan said, "If I were to tell you that the 
entire election process can be finished in one shot, and 
everything taken care of, it would be stupid on my part." 
  He stuck to his guns about the orders to political parties 
on 
cleaning up the walls and hoardings and removal of posters. "If 
I am ignored on this, I will bark, I'll bite, I'll shout and 
fight and do whatever needs doing to be obeyed on this," he 
warned.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 12--The Election Commission has 
issued fresh instructions for seizing arms and ammunition and 
checking the movement of authorised vehicles to ensure the 
smooth and peaceful conduct of elections. 
  The three-page orders have been issued in the light of the 
experience gained during the recently held Assembly elections to 
four Northern States and the Union Territory of Delhi, besides 
Mizoram. 
  According to the directions, no new arms licences would be 
issued during the election period. The police would conduct 
mopping up operations in the areas infested by anti-social 
elements, paying special attention to unearthing unlicensed arms 
and ammunition. The illegal manufacture of firearms would be 
checked by conducting searches and arresting the persons 
involved. 
  Special vigil on the inter-State movement of trucks and 
other 
commercial vehicles has also been suggested to prevent smuggling 
of arms and ammunition and anti-social elements. 
  All firearms licence holders living in sensitive areas would 
be asked to deposit their weapons with the district 
administration for one week from the last date of the withdrawal 
of candidature. Exception may however be made in genuine. 
  Responsibility: The District Magistrate and the 
Superintendent of Police would be personally responsible for 
ensuring that the exemptions granted were genuine. They would be 
liable for sever action if any of the licensed arms which were 
not impounded were found to be misused during elections. 
  Prohibitory orders banning the carrying of licensed arms 
would be issued as soon as the election was announced. If, in 
the opinion of the Director General of Police, there was a real 
threat to the life and property of any person, he or she should 
be provided with necessary security. But under no circumstances 
would he be allowed to carry his own personal firearms or to be 
accompanied by anyone with firearms. 
  The orders prohibit the plying of authorised cars and 
vehicles in a convoy of more than three vehicles. All bigger 
convoys would be broken up even if they were carrying any 
Minister of the Central or State Government or any person 
entitled to any security cover. 
  Failure to do so would be treated as serious and might lead 
to cancellation of the poll, the order said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan 11 (PTI)--Dissatisfied with Assam 
Government's performance, the Election Commission on Tuesday 
night ordered a special revision of electoral rolls in 40 
Assembly constituencies in Assam with some conditions and a 
summary revision in the remaining 86 constituencies with January 
1 this year as the qualifying date. 
  The Commission directed once again that status quo 
ante should be restored in respect of those officers 
working as Electoral Registration Officers [ERO] and Assistant 
EROs in the 40 Assembly constituencies, who were transferred 
without prior approval of the Commission. 
  "The Commission holds these transfers as gross violation of 
its orders and will consider the work of revision of rolls 
vitiated unless status quo ante is restored," a 
communication issued by its Secretary, Mr Ram Kishan said. 
  In another directive, the Commission directed the Central 
Government to indicate by month end the maximum availability of 
Central police forces at a time for deployment in 10 States 
during Assembly elections due from this year-end to March next 
year making it "unequivocally" clear that it will not bunch 
several general elections. 
  The Centre should also indicate the time that would be 
required for the movement of these forces from one place to 
another. 
  "If the reply from government is not received by the 
stipulated date, the Commission will proceed to take decisions 
at the appropriate time on the basis of its own information and 
appreciation of these factors," it said.

  [Text] Calcutta, January 12--The CPI(M-L) [Communist Party 
of India--Marxist-Leninist] general secretary, Liberation group, 
Mr Vinod Mishra, said here yesterday that his party will strive 
for closer co-operation with the CPM and the CPI [Communist 
Party of India] in the Hindi belt, particularly in Uttar Pradesh 
and Bihar, to build up a "Left offensive." 
  He said this had become necessary as with the Janata Dal in 
crisis everywhere, the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh 
had become dependent on the Congress. In the circumstances, one 
could not expect the Mulayam Singh government to oppose the 
Congress government at the Centre on major issues, like the new 
economic policy. 
  At the national plane also, the CPI(M-L) would work unitedly 
with the Left parties to oppose the "anti-people" policies of 
the Rao government at the Centre. The party would participate in 
the proposed rally by the Left parties in Delhi on April 5 
against the Dunkel proposal, he added. 
  Mr Mishra, however, made it clear that while trying to work 
unitedly with the CPM and the CPI elsewhere, the CPI(M-L) would 
continue to oppose the "anti-people" activities of the CPM-led 
Left Front government in West Bengal. Mr Mishra regretted that 
corruption had become institutionalised in West Bengal during 
the 17-year rule of the Left Front government. 
  Asked if they wanted the Left Front government in West 
Bengal 
to go, he replied that they would never like it to be replaced 
by a Congress or the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government. 
They will support the Left Front government in the event of any 
attack on the government by the Centre or communal forces. But 
they would in no case agree to the CPM's demand that they should 
give up their criticism of the Left Front government if they 
wanted to be an ally of the Front. 
  Mr Mishra said that the CPI(M-L), which held its central 
committee meeting for three days ending on January 10, had 
decided that henceforth the Indian People's Front (IPF) an 
associate body of the party, would no longer be an electoral 
platform. Supporters of their cause would henceforth fight the 
elections under the banner of the CPI(M-L). 
  Efforts were on to form a national level platform with the 
IPF and organisation, like Narmada Bachao Andolan, Lal Nishan 
Samiti of Maharashtra and Rajasthan Kishan Sangathan, to fight 
unitedly major issues like communalism and the new economic 
policy. Ms Medha Patkar was scheduled to visit Patna next month 
for holding preliminary talks in this regard. 
  Asked to comment about the emergence of the Bahujan Samaj 
Party, Mr Mishra said that a particular political situation had 
brought the party to the forefront in Uttar Pradesh.

<F P=106> [Article by George Mathew: "Will Government Implement </F>
Reforms?"] 
  [Text] Bombay--It is one of the last vestiges of state 
control in India. The process of freeing the much-protected 
insurance industry from the clutches of government control will 
accelerate with the release of the Malhotra Committee report on 
reforms in the insurance sector. 
  For an industry which accounts for annual premium income of 
around Rs[rupees]10,000 crore, the report will be path-breaking. 
The recommendations have, no doubt, raised new hopes, especially 
among foreign companies and Indian private sector. Will their 
dreams materialise? 
  A host of Indian industrial groups like the ITC group, Kotak 
Mahindra, the Birlas and the Lloyds group have already evinced 
interest in entering the insurance business, if freed from the 
shackles of controls. "Certainly we will look into this 
area...but the Government should make its mind clear about 
accepting the report," says G C Garg, president of Lloyds 
Finance Ltd, a financial services company. 
  Throwing open the sector to foreign companies means the 
entry 
of foreign firms like American Insurance Group, Eagle Star and 
Sun Life. As the hitherto protected Indian insurance industry 
offers tremendous growth potential, foreign firms are expected 
to rush to this new gold mine. 
  Garg feels that insurance is a logical extension of 
financial 
services activities where his company is involved. "Competition 
will improve efficiency," he said while welcoming the Malhotra 
committee recommendations. But will the Government accept the 
proposals? 
  In fact, industrial groups started eyeing the insurance 
sector long before the Government finally woke up with the idea 
of throwing it open and Malhotra Committee was set up to find 
suitable ways for that. "The Government's decision was 
influenced by the international lending agencies like World 
Bank. So it won't be surprising if foreign insurance companies 
make a grand entry into the country," said a former LIC [Life 
Insurance Corporastion] chairman who preferred anonymity. 
  After the nationalisation of 245 private life insurance 
companies into one entity--LIC--and the formation of GIC 
[General Insurance Corporation], competition was a subject 
unheard of in the insurance industry. Will the Government have 
the political courage to implement the recommendations of the 
committee? The trade unions have already raised their opposition 
to privatisation of the sector. Although the Narasimham 
committee submitted its report on reforms in the financial 
sector long ago, critics argue, the Government has not yet made 
any significant changes in the banking sector. 
  Further, the Government would not have access to cheap funds 
of LIC and GIC. As of now, LIC and GIC are required to invest 75 
and 70 percent of the funds in Government and Government 
guaranteed securities--where interest rate is very low--and 
other socially-oriented sectors as may be directed by the 
Government. The committee has recommended that this should be 
reduced to 50 pe cent and 35 percent so that the return from 
investments will be more. Considering the fact that LIC has 
funds of Rs40,000 crore, the Government stands to lose crores of 
rupees. 
  "LIC policies are not attractive as far as other instruments 
of savings are concerned. Their rates of premium are probably 
highest in the world," says a report of the Indian Merchants 
Chamber [IMC] on reforms in the insurance sector. Industry 
circles generally feel that LIC has become too large an 
organisation having seven zonal offices, 93 divisional offices 
and 1,900 branch offices. Will the Government make LIC--which is 
now functioning with a ridiculously low capital of Rs five 
crore--a public limited company? It remains to be seen. So is 
the divestment of 50 per cent GIC's capital to the public. 
  LIC and GIC mandarins and their trade unions still dish out 
the social-responsibility factor to prolong opening up of the 
insurance sector. "Will the private sector and foreign companies 
go to rural areas?" asks a former LIC official, while refusing 
to accept the fact that efficiency has been sacrificed at the 
altar of protectionism. 
  The private sector feels that the insurance sector is still 
vastly untapped, thanks to poor marketing by the public sector 
behemoths. The recommendation of the Malhotra committee that new 
entrants in life insurance should be required to transact a 
certain minimum business in rural areas and new general insurers 
should write a certain minimum rural non-traditional business 
will offset the complaint that private sector will avoid rural 
areas, it is felt. 
  Earlier private insurance companies were nationalised mainly 
on the allegation that these firms were misusing public funds 
for other purposes. The committee's recommendation that no 
insurance company should invest in its affiliate, whether 
incorporated or not, is expected to take care of the fear that 
funds will be misused. 
  The IMC report has argued that prudential norms and 
statutory 
requirements recommended by the Narasimhan committee for banks 
should be made applicable to the insurance sector. By setting up 
an insurance regulatory authority in the form of a statutory 
autonomous board--a la the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (SEBI) in the capital market-level playing ground can be 
assured for both public and private sectors. Indiscriminate 
entry of any Tom, Dick and Harry can be prevented by stipulating 
a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore for new entrants as is 
in the case of new private banks. 
  If earlier indications are anything to go by, there is bound 
to be intense pulls and counter-pulls inside and outside the 
Government when it comes to implementation of the report. To 
what extent the report will be implemented, is anybody's guess.

<F P=106> [Article by Allwyn Fernandes: "Move for Social Audit of Mass </F>
Media"] 
  [Text] Bombay, January 13--Dr N. Bhaskar Rao, convener of 
the Union communications ministry's social audit panel, plans to 
set up a similar group for the mass media, mainly with the help 
of teachers from across the country. 
  Mr Kushwant Singh, noted journalist, and Mr. B.G. Deshmukh, 
former Union cabinet secretary, who are members of the telecom 
panel, are also involved in the new project. They hope to set up 
the mass media panel by April. 
  "I find school principals and teachers around the country 
are 
alarmed at how they are losing control over children, but the 
government is a helpless spectator to the bombardment from the 
skies of satellite TV programmes. 
  "Newspapers everywhere are going in for television and you 
are going to see media conglomerates. There is, therefore, great 
need for professional monitoring and analysis of the media 
scene, keeping the social aspect in mind," Dr Rao, who is 
chairman of the Centre for Media Studies, Delhi, said. 
  Last week, the British Government signalled its intention to 
allow the creation of large British media conglomerates, 
combining newspaper/publishing companies with 
TV/telecommunications groups capable of competing with European 
and American giants. 
  The aim of the review of cross-media ownership rules is to 
ensure the survival of domestic TV production companies and 
strengthen them in their "assault" on rapidly expanding "global 
media markets." The BBC chief has already started talking of the 
BBC as "an empire without frontiers." 
  But the review has raised basic concerns about plural 
sources 
of information in a democracy and about protecting 
readers/viewers. Dr Rao's panel hopes to examine these issues, 
promote debate and suggest policy because the government seems 
to be a "helpless spectator," as he put it. 
  His comments about women and teachers being most concerned 
about the impact of TV is borne out by what is happening in 
Bombay. At least three schools in one Bombay suburb alone have 
been looking for counsellors recently because teachers are 
unable to tackle the problems students now face. 
  In one school where the principal got the parents-teachers 
association involved in the proposal, there was stiff resistance 
from the men who felt that parents would not co-operate "because 
no one wants to discuss family problems with an outsider." 
  It was the women present who asserted themselves, overruled 
the men and passed the proposal because, as one of them put it, 
"it is we who bear the brunt of what is happening, not the men 
who are too busy at work." 
  Dr Rao said he was looking for volunteers in different parts 
of the country not connected with advertising to be involved 
with the panel on an honorary basis. Technology was changing 
social behaviour. Children were making crank calls or using the 
telephone to call sex and astrology services advertised on Star 
TV, out of curiosity, not realising these were international 
calls. 
  In one girls' school in a middle-class suburb here, tenth 
standard children are being encouraged by their peers to have a 
"boyfriend." Those who say their parents will not allow them are 
told, "Don't worry, we'll get you a telephone friend." Those who 
do not have a phone at home find the telecom centres that have 
spouted out everywhere convenient to call their "telefriends." 
Parents are alarmed because "we do not even know who is at the 
other end of the line." 
  Dr Rao said he first toyed with the idea of a mass media 
panel seven years ago when he set up a national council of TV 
viewers in 18 towns. Most of the panel members were women and 
teachers because he had found they were the most worried about 
the impact of mass media on the younger generation. 
  "I also find that most people are quick to agree in private 
conversation about the problems likely to be caused on children 
by TV viewing. But they hesitate to say so in public because 
they are afraid of being dubbed backward or conservative by 
their peer groups. They are waiting for someone to take the 
initiative," he said. 
  The national council of TV viewers did not pick up, probably 
because at that time people had not realised the impact TV would 
have on the minds of young viewers. But now that satellite TV 
was a part of the media scene, the panel was an idea whose time 
had arrived, he felt. 
  Newspapers everywhere were carrying stories of children 
picking up ideas to commit crime from TV serials. In Bombay, a 
boy had killed his grandfather. There was a similar incident in 
Calcutta, while in Delhi on New York's eve, youths abducted a 
woman and tried to rape her. Only timely action by the public 
and the police had saved her. 
  Dr Rao said he was inspired to set up the mass media social 
audit panel because of his experience in the telecom panel over 
the past 18 months. The telecom social audit panel was the first 
of its kind in the country and was set up to bring about greater 
responsiveness in the operations of the telecom and postal 
services. 
  The panel, headed by the former chief justice, Mr P.N. 
Bhagwati, has made several recommendations on postal and 
telecommunication services, involving operational and policy 
changes, aimed at making the subscriber the focal point and 
prime concern of the system. 
  Many of the suggestions made in the four reports submitted 
so 
far have been accepted by the communications ministry. These 
include giving the subscriber a rebate for the period the 
telephone is dead, and using the software in electronic 
exchanges to allow a user who had not paid the bill to receive 
calls, but not make them. 
  "New technology has come in many areas, but the rules have 
not changed to keep pace with it. The same thing is happening in 
mass media. Technology is overtaking us. We shall have to 
develop a methodology of social audit of mass media to monitor 
the role, impact and the way it is used," says Dr Rao.

<F P=106> [Article by Srinivas Laxman] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, January 16--Every afternoon the Indian Air 
Force [IAF] station at Yelahanka near Bangalore used to resound 
to the boom of a tiny jet performing numerous manoeuvres during 
last month's air show. 
  Its performance created a lot of excitement among the 
delegates and among those present were the IAF top brass who 
seemed truly impressed. 
  The aircraft which displayed its prowess at the Bangalore 
air 
show was the British Aerospace advanced jet trainer (AJT), Hawk 
and exactly a month later the government of India has decided to 
acquire this aircraft for the IAF. 
  The Hawk's immediate rival, the Franco-German Alpha which 
was 
also to have been displayed at this air show, pulled out and 
French aviation officials were unable to explain this sudden 
move. This further lent credence to the theory that the Alpha 
advanced jet trainer (AJT) had lost the race to get into the IAF 
inventory. 
  The government of India has been dithering over the choice 
of 
the AJT for more than a decade and efforts by various IAF chiefs 
to convince the government to take a quick decision had proved 
futile. 
  The IAF was in dire need of a trainer because of the 
difficulties pilots faced while graduating from the subsonic 
Kiran trainer to the supersonic aircraft. This transition was 
being done on the Hunters but they had now become old. 
  According to the former deputy chief of air staff, C.V. 
Gole, 
"the government's perennial excuse for delaying the decision on 
the AJT was lack of funds." 
  While the government remained undecided on such an important 
matter, IAF pilots were all the while facing a mismatch between 
man and machine, as a pilot took combat training in an aircraft 
with old technology, but had to fly a modern fighter like the 
Mirage 2000 and Mig-29. This eventually began to take its toll. 
  Initially, there were four types of AJTs trying for the 
attention of the Indian government. These were the British 
Aerospace Hawk, the Dassault Breguet-Dornier Alpha, Aeromachhi's 
MB-339 and Czechoslovakia's Aero L-39. 
  After evaluation, the choice narrowed down between the Alpha 
and the Hawk. Eventually, the Hawk has emerged victorious. 
  Explaining why the Alpha was not found suitable, Mr P. 
Upendra, MP [,ember of Parliament], said in the Rajya Sabha on 
August 27, 1993, that the last model of this aircraft was 
produced in 1986. 
  He said: "All Dassault proposes is to transfer to India its 
jigs and tooling equipment, which have been lying idle in France 
for years since there is no further market for Alpha jets 
anywhere in the world..." Thus the Alpha lost out. 
  Media reports today speak of the Union cabinet giving the 
green signal for the acquisition of 66 British Aerospace Hawks, 
expected to cost over Rs 6,000 crores. 
  The first major Hawk variant was the "50 series" which was 
sold to Finland, Kenya and Indonesia. The "50 series" was 
succeeded in 1981 by the "60 series" which incorporated changes 
in the avionic system. This was the aircraft being considered by 
the IAF. 
  The Hawk-60 with various changes resulted in a 33 percent 
payload increase and a 30 percent increase in range. Its 
customers include Zimbabwe, Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu 
Dhabi and Switzerland. 
  In 1984 came Hawk-200 which was followed three years later 
by 
the Hawk 100 which was displayed at Bangalore. The question is 
whether the government will now opt for this variant of the Hawk?

  [Text] The hasty destruction of Tehran's shacks and 
dugouts, theft, inconvenience, prostitution and behavior, 
actions, and thinking in general have scattered dwellers in 
shanties, who until now were confined to this area, throughout 
the capital and have increased their numbers. After their 
shanties and dugouts were made into parks and other centers, the 
shanty dwellers took the same life to which they have become 
accustomed over the years to other parts of the city and made 
themselves new shanties. 
  Even those who were installed in new housing by the 
government in newly established towns migrated to other 
locations after a time because they were not familiar with urban 
and apartment life. 
  Experts say this serious and deeply rooted social problem 
cannot be solved by building parks and libraries on top of the 
shanty towns and dugouts. It needs years of cultural and social 
work to uproot the thinking and lifestyle of living in shanties 
and dugouts, with all its characteristics. 
  The inattention of officials to doing fundamental work to 
change the culture of the society of dugout and shanty dwellers, 
especially the youth, has spread various forms of criminal 
behavior, which were once confined to the shanty areas to other 
parts of the capital. The young generation of shanty dwellers is 
illiterate and lacks any kind of skill. Now they do not know how 
to do anything but collect garbage, scavenge, steal from homes, 
snatch purses, steal automobiles, buy and sell narcotics, prowl 
neighborhoods, and annoy people. In reality, the dugouts and 
shantytowns can be called societies for training young criminals. 
  After driving out the shanty dwellers and destroying their 
huts, they have now created the same conditions that existed 
before in different parts of the city, and naturally they are 
more difficult to control than before. 
  Experts believe that before turning these areas into parks, 
recreational centers and other things, officials should have 
changed the social and training makeup of the shantytowns 
through the necessary instruction, by operating short-term 
literacy programs and by teaching the young people some kind of 
specialization and ability. For example, after the women on 
Jamshid Street in the Qazvin gate area were driven out, they 
scattered to other parts of the city and continued living in the 
same way. 
  A problem the dugout dwellers faced immediately after their 
neighborhoods were destroyed was the loss of their identity and 
lack of familiarity with normal urban life. For this reason, 
after they were driven from their shantytowns, they tried to 
create the same atmosphere and conditions in other parts of the 
city. The government transferred some of the shanty dwellers to 
cities built during these years, but after a short time these 
families realized that the culture of shanty dwelling is not 
compatible with the culture of living in these kinds of places 
and they gradually moved away from urban life and returned to 
their former lives. 
  In other words, the shanty dwellers were merely displaced, 
and they took their lifestyle with them wherever they went. The 
experts worry that dealing precipitously and without study with 
the issue of life in dugouts and shanties in the early years of 
the revolution is gradually bringing the failures of the past 
back to the city. One of the most sensitive areas is the Jamshid 
area, where the women of Qel'eh, formerly Shahr-e No, live. In 
recent years famous dugouts in Tehran such as Zanburak Khuneh, 
Haluqanbar, Qasem Shokry, 'Arabha, Haj Masha'allah, Majalleh-ye 
Jamshid, Baghchal, Seyyed Darvish, Halab Shahr, and Nafari were 
destroyed without the necessary study of their social, family 
and cultural situation and their employment. Yet before settling 
the residents of these dugouts in other places, it was necessary 
first to think about the state of their education, their 
health-care situation, and most important of all, their moral, 
ethical, and psychological problems. The youth and adolescents 
in the shantytowns are either illiterate or only partially 
literate. Their only recreation is theft, harassment, and buying 
and selling narcotics. 
  Sociologists believe that destroying dugouts and shantytowns 
destroys the physical makeup and the identity of the 
neighborhoods, and on the other hand, by scattering the 
shantytowns it disrupts the web of social relations. Officials 
are now seeing the return of some shanty dwellers to some of 
these areas, and this in itself shows the strength of the 
structural roots in the phenomenon of shanty towns. In some 
districts not only have the shantytowns not been uprooted, but 
other shanty towns have also been created. 
  There are now 50,000 people living in shantytowns scattered 
throughout the capital.

  Mohammad Sadeq-Falah, chief of Yazd Customs, said on Monday:

goods is the export of 2,000 tons of decorative stone last year, 
and added: This is due to the increase in weight of the export 
goods in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993].

  [Text] Last year we gave a report on suicides in the 
province of Mazandaran. The Islamic Republic's official sources 
are now reporting that last year 4,000 people committed suicide 
in the province of Khorasan. The main reason for the suicides 
was the pressure of poverty and the inability to make a living. 
It was announced that 2,800 women and 1,300 men committed 
suicide. Almost 50 percent of those who kill themselves are 10 
to 30 years old. 
  Last year 4,000 people killed themselves in Khorasan. 
Research and studies by physicians and sociologists at Mashhad 
University show that almost all these people were under heavy 
and unbearable economic pressure and were unable to manage their 
families. 
  A cleric from Mashhad said that economic pressures alienate 
a 
human being from God, and alienation from God makes suicide easy. 
  The supervisor of the toxicology ward at Emam Reza Hospital 
in Mashhad said the statistics on suicide in the province of 
Khorasan are very worrisome in terms of their numbers and 
motivation for doing so. Moreover, the number of people who are 
taking their own lives as a way out of economic and social 
problems is on the rise. Of the 4,000 people who killed 
themselves last year, 2,800 were women and 1,200 were men. These 
people used tranquilizers and chemical poisons to kill 
themselves, or immolated themselves. 
  Statistics from Khorasan's hospitals show that men are more 
determined about their decisions to kill themselves than women, 
because they usually do so in such a way under daily pressures 
that there is no way to save them. Research by the supervisor of 
the toxicology ward at Emam Reza Hospital has shown that 49 
percent of the suicides take place between the ages of 10 and 
30. Of these 4,000 people, 53 percent were married, 45 percent 
were single and 4 percent were divorced. A sad point, according 
to this doctor, is that a small number of the individuals who 
immolate themselves survive, but become depressed because of the 
changes in their bodies and faces. A sociologist at Ferdowsi 
University in Mashhad believes that these days, for reasons that 
are clear, suicides that were once done secretly are now done in 
the open. This professor emphasized that economic disruptions in 
societies such as Iran's cause these kinds of suicides. He 
warned the government that suicides take place when there is no 
other option, and this is the reason the number of suicides is 
increasing every day. 
  A judge in Khorasan said the reason for the increase in 
suicides is the lack of correspondence between incomes and 
costs. Of the 4,000 who killed themselves last year in Khorasan, 
74 percent had high school diplomas or less, 23 percent were 
illiterate, and 3 percent had studied in universities. Last year 
only 60 people who immolated themselves were taken to the 
accident ward at Mashhad's Qa'em Hospital. Of these, 98 percent 
were women, and unfortunately 99 percent of them died. 
  Hospital officials and Khorasan judges have said: Most of 
the 
self-immolations are done because of financial pressures, which 
are followed by family disputes. Many people in the province of 
Khorasan wonder how in a religious region in the country where 
religious beliefs are supposed to meet the spiritual and 
psychological needs of the people and give them peace of mind, 
the suicide rate is higher than in other parts of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jamshidi, the international economy </F>
deputy minister of industries, on Thursday, 3 Feb 1994, by IRNA; 
place not given] 
  [Text] Sari, [IRNA] -- The international economy 
deputy minister of industries said: In the nine months of this 
year, $460 million in various goods have been exported. 
  Dr. Jamshidi said on Thursday in an interview with an IRNA 
reporter: Industrial goods in the area of exports have two 
advantages, the relative low cost of energy and especially low 
wages. 
  He added: In some industries, including tiles, our country 
has the ability to compete with foreign countries. At the 
present time, Iranian tiles are exported to Kuwait and the 
Persian Gulf sheikdoms. Also, contracts have been signed to 
export them to Central Asian countries. 
  He said: Subsidies for export goods are meaningless; goods 
must be produced to be competitive with similar foreign goods. 
  Dr. Jamshidi said: After the foreign currency rate became a 
floating rate in an attempt to prevent the entry of foreign 
goods, tariffs and commercial taxes were increased. At the 
present time, however, on the whole they are still not 
sufficient.

  [Text] [News Service] -- With the closure of nearly 840 km 
of eastern borders of the country to smugglers, the roads to the 
passage of narcotics convoys through the borders into the 
country was closed. 
  According to a report by the Central News Unit, referring to 
the above statement, Mr. Besharati said: The work on closing the 
borders in the vulnerable areas began four months ago, and these 
operations were completed with the digging of a canal 4 meters 
high and wide, the installation of numerous watch towers, and 
putting mines on the path of narcotics convoys. At the present 
time, these convoys cannot enter the country. 
  Concerning the recent riot in Zahedan instigated by 
narcotics 
smugglers, referring to the march of the Muslim and 
revolutionary people of Zahedan in condemning this action by 
rioters, the minister of interior added: The Shi'ite and Sunni 
brothers and sisters with their march against the narcotics 
smugglers once again declared their support for the Islamic 
revolution, the grand leader, and the president and put an end 
to all the rumors spread by internal and foreign enemies.

  [Text] Because of the crisis stemming from the Gulf war, 
Saudi Arabia has had to pay out vast amounts of money, estimated 
at $55 billion. However, despite that, it has been able to 
surmount the crisis. 
  This was the message of the Saudi ambassador to Great 
Britain, Dr. Ghazi al-Qusaybi, in a new response to biased media 
reports being circulated about the Saudi Arabian economy. 
  In his reply, the Saudi ambassador dealt with more than one 
economic aspect that those reports had raised. He categorically 
denied the truth of a report that the Kingdom is attempting to 
obtain loans to defray the state's general budget deficit. He 
stressed that no negotiations were underway between Saudi Arabia 
and any Western or non-Western banking institution to obtain 
loans. 
  Ambassador al-Qusaybi's statements coincided with a study by 
the magazine, CORPORATE LOCATION, to the effect that Saudi 
Arabia, among all the Arab nations, was among the top 20 nations 
in the world that have an appropriate climate to attract 
investments. The study polled about 10,000 companies in the 
United States and Britain, and all of them stressed that the 
economic climate in Saudi Arabia was suitable for investment. 
Those companies are active in all parts of the world. Half of 
them specialize in production, and the other half offer 
services, concentrating on engineering, new technology, and 
mining industry sectors. 
  Moreover, a study by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry pointed out that since the beginning of its planning 
era, the Kingdom has striven to prepare an appropriate 
investment climate for the private sector through a clearly 
defined economic policy based on the philosophy of free economy 
and open markets. A group of regulations, measures, and laws 
have shared in applying this philosophy, organizing 
relationships between national and foreign capital on the one 
hand, and between them and the state on the other. All of that 
is achieved by the supervision of governmental or specialized 
private organizations, who work to direct and guide the private 
sector to available investment opportunities. 
  With regard to the details of all that, Ambassador 
al-Qusaybi 
explained that the Kingdom has not requested any loans from 
international or financial institutions. The ambassador pointed 
out that the only foreign loan the Kingdom had on hand was for 
$4.5 billion. This is the amount the Kingdom previously borrowed 
from abroad; there are no other loans. 
  The Saudi ambassador stated frankly that it was strange that 
people were talking now about the Kingdom's general budget 
deficit, since in the past six or seven years, there has been a 
disparity between expenditures and income in the budget. As for 
the statement of the Bank of International Settlements that as 
of November 1993 Saudi Arabia has borrowed more than $2 billion 
from it, over the past few years, that same bank has set as a 
kind of general guideline standard for the percentage of 
indebtedness, either domestically or abroad, that debts should 
not exceed 60 percent of the gross national product. In fact, 
Ambassador al-Qusaybi stated, the Kingdom's foreign and domestic 
indebtedness, as the bank knows, does not even come close to 60 
percent. On the contrary, the Kingdom's foreign debts do not 
exceed $4.5 billion. 
  The Saudi ambassador clearly stated that the Kingdom did not 
expect anyone to express uneasiness or to inform it of its 
responsibilities in this important regard. The authorities 
concerned will continue the pressure of governmental 
expenditures, but in such a way as to not cause any injury to 
the citizens. He pointed out that the inflation rate in the 
Kingdom was one of the lowest rates in the world. As for the 
price of oil and its influence on the Kingdom's economy, the 
Saudi ambassador said: "I believe that we cannot be governed by 
the day-to-day price of oil. Certainly, OPEC will take measures 
to guarantee that the oil price will remain at reasonable 
levels. What happened recently should not, in any case, be a 
measurement for what the oil situation will be in the coming 
months." 
  Going back to the Saudi Chamber of Commerce study, it stated 
that private investment in the Kingdom enjoys many encouraging 
incentives, which have contributed to the private sector's 
participation in economic activity and to the increase in that 
participation. These incentives include: 

  -  The Saudi Development Fund offers loans up to as much as 
50 percent of the project's costs. 
  -  Total exemption of Saudi industrial or nonindustrial 
companies 
from all taxes pertaining to companies. They are subject to the 
zakat [Islamic charity tax] at 2.5 percent of available 
liquidity. 
  -  The imported goods required for the industrial project are 
also 
completely exempt from customs duties. These imports include 
machinery, tools, equipment, systems, spare parts, and primary 
and partially manufactured raw materials. 
  -  The state also offers the land required to build factories, 
as 
well as workers and officials' housing, on a nominal lease. This 
has caused the state to build several industrial cities, 
furnished with all services. 
  -  Local production enjoys complete protection by various means, 
which includes limiting or preventing the importing of foreign 
goods similar to local production, raising the customs duties on 
them, and offering various means of financial assistance to 
Saudi industrial organizations. 
  -  The exemption from export fees and all other taxes of 
products 
prepared for export is also permitted. 
  -  All of these measures are to encourage capital to enter 
investment fields in the Kingdom. There are also several 
incentives to foreign capital as well, including: 
  -  Foreign capital enjoys all the advantages enjoyed by national 
capital. The industrial or agricultural project, in which 
foreign capital is invested, also enjoys exemption from income 
and company taxes for 10 years. Other projects are exempt for 
five years. The exemption has the proviso that national capital 
must own not less than 25 percent of the capital allocated to 
the project as a whole. 
  -  In addition, there are several other incentives, such as 
direct 
and indirect support for the agricultural sector, through easy 
loans, subsidies, favorable prices, and reduction of electricity 
and water costs, since the state provides the private sector 
with electricity at a very low cost. The state also bears the 
expenses for training workers in national factories, either in 
the Kingdom or abroad. 

    According to the study, all of this stresses the confidence 
of the Saudi economy in itself while, at the same time, 
confirming its soundness, especially in the integration between 
the private sector and the state. However, that is without any 
impinging on a free economy and free markets. An economy like 
this is not affected by a crisis or crises, except if the crisis 
occurs directly and, then, it rapidly transcends that crisis. 
  According to a specialist in this field, the financial 
straits that affected Saudi Arabia because of the exorbitant 
costs of the Gulf war were quickly ended, since the 1993 budget 
was an expansion budget. It totalled 196.95 billion riyals [R] 
(approximately $65 billion), i.e., an increase of 8.8 percent 
over the 1992 budget. The deficit was estimated at R27.8 billion 
($8 billion), i.e., a reduction of 7.4 percent over the 1992 
budget deficit. 
  It is clear from Saudi budget numbers that for the fifth 
consecutive year estimates of general expenditures for 1993 are 
higher than estimates for the previous year. This has helped to 
keep the level of economic growth high for the foreseeable 
future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar, </F>
Saudi economist, in Riyadh; date not given: "Our Economy is 
Strong; We Face No Problem With Foreign Obligations"--first two 
paragraphs 'UKAZ introduction] 
  [Text] 'UKAZ AL-IQTISADI posed two important questions to 
several financial experts and economists, concerning the future 
of the Saudi economy in light of economic and oil conditions in 
the world. 
  Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar is a member of 
the 
Shura [Consultative] Council, a well-known economic expert, and 
a professor in the King Fahd Oil and Minerals University. He 
previously responded to two questions, confirming the strength 
of the economic situation in the Kingdom. He stressed the 
excellence of the actions taken by the government of the 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
to support the Saudi riyal and to balance expenditure of income. 
Those actions are concerned with doubling production revenues 
and diversifying sources of income. 
<H5>  Increased Role for Private Sector </H5>
  ['UKAZ] How does the Saudi budget appear to you in terms of 
support for the strength and firmness of the Saudi economy? 
  [Al-Mu'ammar] Issuing the general state budget for 1993/94 
represents our government's commitment to strengthening the 
course of economic and social growth for our beloved country. 
  Despite the fact that exports of crude oil still represent 
86 
percent of total Saudi exports, i.e., 75 percent of total 
governmental income, we see a gradual, tangible increase in the 
total of our nonpetroleum exports. They include materials with 
added value, such as refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, 
and fertilizers; derivatives of the petrochemical industry, like 
plastics, synthetic fibers and polyester; agricultural products 
such as grain, vegetables, flowers, etc. Moreover, we should 
note that the private sector has in fact begun to make very 
large capital investments in industrial parks in major cities 
like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, in addition to the two 
industrial cities of al-Jubayl and Yanbu. One must not forget 
the important role played by the public sector, represented by 
the efforts of the Ministry of Industry and Electricity, 
Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry 
of Finance and National Economy in supporting and encouraging 
the private sector to play the desired role in the growth of the 
national economy. This was done through offering various means 
of support, such as subsidies, loans, and reduced customs fees 
on Saudi exports. 
  Despite intense world competition, faced by our products 
abroad, Saudi Arabia's joining the international General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, will reduce the 
pressure of customs barriers that our exports encounter in 
international markets. It will also overcome the obstacles that 
the private sector faces in the field of foreign investments and 
exports, since these two areas support private sector 
opportunities, so that it may play its hoped-for role alongside 
the governmental sector. It is anticipated that sales of Saudi 
national products, through the Saudi Industrial Exports Company, 
will have reached 750 million riyals [R] at the end of 1993. [.sup]1[/] 

  The strength and firmness of the Saudi economy stems from 
this. We should note that the growth rate of the private 
sector's gross domestic product [GDP] is not less than 5 percent 
for the current fiscal year, according to statistics cited in 
the state budget for this year. It is expected that the actual 
GDP will grow at a 7-percent rate, compared with 9 percent for 
1991.[.sup]2[/] 
  The GDP for the same period is estimated at R381 billion, 
according to Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency statistics. 
  This rate is one of the highest growth rates in the 
developing world, following directly after the rapidly 
developing Asian nations, like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, 
Malaysia, etc. We should also not fail to mention the important 
fact that inflation rates in our country are still reasonable, 
compared with many developing nations. The state has 
participated in stabilizing consumer goods through guiding 
public expenditures and organizing imports, as well as various 
means of support offered to local merchants. 
<H5>  Causes of Income Reduction </H5>
  ['UKAZ] How can the Kingdom maintain its strong economic 
position and continue spending on construction, growth, 
development, and modernization, despite the burdens that have 
resulted from the Gulf war disaster and despite the falling oil 
prices? 
  [Al-Mu'ammar] You mentioned two important matters in your 
question: the falling oil prices of the past 10 years, 
specifically 1983-1993, and the consequences stemming from the 
Gulf war. Both of these are problems that the Kingdom cannot 
deal with alone. On the contrary, international efforts through 
the organization of oil exporting nations known as OPEC, of 
which there are 12 permanent member states today, including the 
Kingdom, are being made to draw up production and pricing 
policies for the member states. However, in the middle eighties, 
we noted the difficulty OPEC had managing production and pricing 
policies by itself. This was because of many important factors 
including: 
  1. Increased oil production by countries outside of OPEC. 
Britain increased its oil production to 700,000 barrels per day 
[bpd] during 1993. Russia's production also increased to 1.6 
million barrels during the same year, i.e., an increase 
estimated at 20 percent over the previous year, in view of its 
need for hard currency to support its economy. 
  2. Energy strategies followed in countries belonging to the 
International Energy Agency, which has made Paris its 
headquarters. Perhaps the most important of these strategies is 
the increase of strategic oil storage by industrial states, 
estimated at 4.5 billion barrels in the early nineties. World 
production of oil did drop slightly to 59.6 million bpd in 1993, 
as a result of reduced demand for refined products in those 
countries. 
  3. World economic stagnation in major industrial nations, 
such as Japan and Europe, and its ramifications on the world's 
demand for oil. Economic growth rates were relatively low; they 
are increasing only 1 to 1.5 percent annually in the best of 
conditions. 
  4. Divisions within OPEC nations themselves, either because 
of political conflicts like the Iraq-Iran War in the eighties; 
the Gulf war in 1990, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait from 
the Iraqi invasion, which some world critics have called the 
first petroleum war; or other economic reasons that are strongly 
connected to general budgets and the balance of payments 
deficits of many member states. All of this has induced these 
countries to exceed set production quotas and the official 
prices set in accordance with OPEC ministerial decisions, out of 
a desire to increase their income from oil exports. 
<H5>  Resolute Treatment of the Problem </H5>
  We are also all aware that since 1985, like the rest of the 
OPEC nations and many other countries of the world, including 
the major industrialized countries, Saudi Arabia has faced the 
consequences of these conditions. However, the Kingdom has faced 
them with strength and by following these means: 
  1. Issuing treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and 
National Economy, and selling them to borrow money for a fixed 
period of time. This represents a guaranteed investment for 
purchasers, most of whom are national banks. The value of 
governmental bonds held by Saudi banks is less than $15 billion, 
according to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance and 
National Economy.[.sup]3[/] It is well known that the 
disparity in the general budget for 1993 totalled R27.8 billion, 
compared with R30 billion for 1992. This difference between 
income and expenditures was covered by borrowing. 
  2. Full receipt of customs fees pertaining to the state in 
various sectors. This includes services for telephone, 
electricity, and water; customs duties on imports in airports 
and harbors; and, security sectors, such as traffic, passports, 
etc. These fees represent important income for the state of not 
less than R5 billion. 
  3. Continuing to guide the state's general expenditures 
through a reduction in spending in various state organizations. 
Total expenditures allocated in this year's budget amounted to 
R160 billion, compared with R197 billion for the last fiscal 
year. 
  4. Continuing to support OPEC efforts to stabilize oil 
prices 
under a specific production ceiling that will serve the economic 
development plans of the OPEC nations. 
<H5>  Practical Solutions for the Crisis </H5>
  It is well known that the current OPEC ceiling is 24.5 
million barrels, or some 40 percent of world oil production, 
while the actual production capacity of OPEC nations is 28 
million bpd. The average sale price of a barrel of Arab light 
(34 degree) oil is $11, while Saudi Arabia's production of crude 
oil reached 8 million bpd at the end of 1993. The fluctuation of 
prices could be dealt with through reducing OPEC production by 
1.5 to 2 million bpd, but the recent OPEC ministerial conference 
regarded this idea as unlikely, in view of the possibility of 
non-OPEC producers' increasing their oil production at the 
expense of the OPEC nations. 
  5. Stabilizing the Saudi riyal's current exchange rate 
vis-a-vis hard foreign currencies through supporting it with 
Saudi foreign monetary reserves which, in the first part of the 
last decade, totalled $130 billion, according to IMF estimates. 
The minister of finance and national economy, Shaykh Muhammad 
Aba-al-Khayl, has pointed out that the Saudi currency was fully 
covered by a special reserve of hard currency of more than $20 
billion.[.sup]4[/] It is clear that the percentage of 
governmental domestic borrowing is about 94 percent of the 
total, while the country's foreign borrowing from international 
banks is only 6 percent, i.e., an estimated amount of $4.5 
billion. This undoubtedly means that the Kingdom's foreign 
obligation is very limited, and could be repaid within a short 
time, inasmuch as the greatest percentage of borrowing is local 
and not foreign. 
  With regard to the percentage of budget deficit to gross 
national product, we found it to be 52 percent of this product. 
To a considerable extent, this is the same as rates found in 
advanced industrial nations, such as the United States and 
France.[.sup]5[/] If we take into consideration the 
completion of the infrastructure for most of the physical and 
human development projects, and the large trade surplus in its 
favor in the balance of foreign trade payments, which is 
estimated at R81 billion for 1991[.sup]6[/], we find that 
Saudi Arabia is proceeding ahead surefootedly to support its 
national economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, minister of industry </F>
and electricity, by Mahdi Abu Fatim 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Qaysi: "The 
Time Has Not Come for Production"--first two paragraphs 'UKAZ 
introduction] 
  [Text] When His Excellency Engineer 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, 
the minister of industry and electricity, welcomed the 
opportunity to give this interview, it was clear that he had in 
his agenda lots of topics that he wanted to bring up. 
  His Excellency candidly answered all of our questions, which 
are being pondered by many businessmen and industrialists and 
gave precise replies dealing with a number of issues that are of 
concern to these sectors of the economy as well as to a large 
number of our citizens. He concluded by saying that Saudi 
Arabia's industries are marching in the direction of progress, 
guaranteeing the nation a bright future that will bring 
prosperity to our country and its citizens. 
  [Al-Qaysi] First we would like to have Your Excellency 
review 
the developments that have taken place in the industrial and 
electrical sectors of this wealthy nation under the 
circumstances of the tremendous growth that it has experienced. 
  [Al-Zamil] It is a pleasure for me to review with you some 
of 
the basic features of the development of industry and 
electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There is no doubt 
that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of 
industry and electricity. I would like to begin by talking about 
industry and providing a brief introduction before mentioning 
the achievements of industrial development in Saudi Arabia. 
  First I would like to point out that the basis for, and 
essential element of, industrial development in Saudi Arabia is 
the fact that Saudi Arabia totally adheres to the principles of 
Islamic law. The government of the Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques has taken upon itself to translate these principles into 
reality such that they guarantee complete freedom of action for 
Saudi Arabia's individuals and citizens. This freedom has 
provided investors with a feeling of security and thus unleashed 
all manner of intellectual capacities and given them all 
possible chances to seek different opportunities. Investors, 
whether citizens or non-citizens, have begun to feel a sense of 
responsibility, starting with the projects that they are 
concerned with. The role of the state has basically consisted of 
providing a suitable investment climate, basic arrangements and 
facilities, and some incentives. These arrangements, facilities, 
and incentives have created a suitable natural environment in 
which investors can operate and begin to carry out their 
activity. 
  These arrangements and facilities consist of the creation of 
the industrial cities, the provision of land necessary for the 
industrial projects, and the necessary utilities for the 
establishment of these projects, in addition to the availability 
of the necessary loans for industry and customs exemptions for 
the equipment and raw materials necessary for these projects. 
  These arrangements, facilities, and incentives, along with 
the principle of a free economy, constitute the foundation that 
has impelled businessmen to get moving and start seeking 
industrial projects. The result of this has been noticeable 
industrial growth, consisting of more than 2,036 industrial 
projects in various areas of Saudi Arabia in which 140 billion 
riyals [R] have been invested. They have produced products 
valued at more than R50 billion, including R10 billion of 
products that have been exported to other nations. 
  All of these tangible results and achievements have come 
about as a result of the efforts of our citizens and investors 
operating in a climate of unlimited support provided by the 
state. These enterprises have not been merely a facade to boast 
about, but also have come about in order to satsify market 
demand and were set up in accordance with international 
specifications in order that they compete in the domestic 
market, which is an open market. Consequently, we expect a 
continuation of the natural growth of this industrial progress 
in the years to come. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia follows the principle of a free 
economy, and industry is the backbone of the economy of the 
advanced nations. Why, then, is industry not given free rein to 
develop more widely, by means of the unrestricted and 
unconditional granting of licenses? 
  [Al-Zamil] I would not be exaggerating if I said that 
investors are complaining about the great degree of flexibility 
shown by the Ministry in granting industrial licenses. Many of 
the investors with whom I have met on numerous occasions in 
various areas of Saudi Arabia have had complaints about the high 
degree of flexibility shown by the Ministry of Industry and 
Electricity when it comes to giving out industrial licenses, and 
this means that there is lots of competition. Things have 
reached the point where as many as 15 competing enterprises are 
producing the same product. This is why they have demanded that 
the Ministry put a limit on these licenses. The Ministry's 
position in this matter is, to a large degree, in accordance 
with what I mentioned concerning the fact that there must be 
flexibility and an open-door policy, because the investors, to a 
great extent, know best what is in their own interest, 
especially if they have the capability of investing large 
amounts of money. But it is necessary for the Ministry to 
provide information to a given investor and to clarify it for 
him as well as to tell him that the product he wishes to 
manufacture is, for example, already being produced by 15 other 
enterprises, and that this production covers the needs of the 
nation. 
  But such an investor might have a point of view that can 
persuade the Ministry to change its mind. In such a case his 
application is accepted if it is proved that he has a new brand 
that will have a market share or particular demand, or if he has 
information concerning domestic or foreign markets that the 
Ministry does not have. 
  Perhaps the greatest proof of what I have said is the fact 
that, in addition to licenses for the currently existing 2,036 
enterprises, the Ministry has issued a total of about 1,400 
licenses for new, future industrial projects. 
  [Al-Qaysi] To what extent has the Ministry completed the 
project to link electrical power networks throughout Saudi 
Arabia, and what alternative solutions are there in case of 
power failures such as the one that occurred recently in the 
power line between the eastern and central regions? 
  [Al-Zamil] The state has spent large amounts on the 
electrical sector, and has provided electrical service in all 
areas of the country. At this point I would like to mention that 
the number of persons who received electricity by the end of 
last year totalled more than two milllion customers, and that we 
have covered all the main cities and villages. Electrical 
service now, praise be to God, has become a basic service, and 
the state is providing this service at rates that are quite a 
bit below actual cost. This is in keeping with King Fahd's 
directives to make life easier for our citizens. 
  Our power linkage system is considered to be an advanced 
system that utilizes high technology. At this juncture I would 
like to point out that most of the technicians working in the 
electrical sector are Saudi personnel. 
  As for the projects dealing with linking electrical power 
among the various regions, they have already begun to be 
implemented some time ago. The project for linking the eastern 
region is already finished, and work in all its areas is nearly 
over, with the exception of the power line between Dammam and 
Hafr al-Batin, which will be finished within four months. We 
have also finished the power network inside the central region, 
that is, the power line which links Riyadh to al-Qasim and 
Sudayr. And now there is a program to link Riyadh to al-Aflaj, 
and this will mean that the network in the central region will 
be all linked together except for Wadi al-Dawasir. 
  We have also finished the power network inside the western 
region since Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, Yanbu', and al-Ta'if are now 
linked. Currently efforts are also being made to finish the 
power linkage projects inside the southern region, and, in fact, 
al-Bahah has been linked to Bishah and we are now working on the 
link between 'Asir and Najran. 
  When the networks inside the regions have been completed, we 
will concentrate on linking the regions with each other. We have 
already begun the step of linking the eastern region to the 
central region, and they already exchange power loads. Also, 
Riyadh is linked to al-Qasim. Furthermore, a study has been made 
concerning linking al-Qasim to Medina, and this will result in 
the eastern, central, and western regions being all linked to 
each other. And in the future, God willing, there will be a link 
between the western and southern regions. 
  At this point I would like to stress the importance of these 
linking networks. They have been operating with a high degree of 
efficiency. In spite of the incident that you mentioned, I 
assure you that this incident only serves to clearly show how 
rarely such incidents occur. We praise God that throughout the 
last ten years since the project was first put into operation 
the electrical power networks have operated at a high degree of 
efficiency and they have never been down. Many people have not 
realized that Riyadh gets its electricity from the eastern 
region and that Mecca receives its power from Rabigh. 
  Here I would like to mention one important point, which is 
the fact that there is no system anywhere in the world that is 
totally immune from such power outages. This is something that 
is impossible. But there are systems that operate at high 
efficency. I don't think there is any system that can operate 
for 10 years without some incident happening and not be 
considered to be indeed an efficient system. So we are gradually 
putting our systems into operation, and we will continue to work 
on perfecting them. 
  [Al-Qaysi] And what if such an incident does happen? 
  [Al-Zamil] This is to be expected. There are additional 
solutions that might be costly, but sometimes it is important to 
use them. These solutions involve increasing the generating 
capacity in some of the regions so that power is transmitted at 
the lowest possible level. We have already taken this matter 
into consideration. We generate power in Mecca, Medina, and 
al-Ta'if. But we cannot, for example, generate all the power 
necessary for Mecca or even for the city of Riyadh, for which we 
are now planning to construct a ninth generator station. All the 
generator stations that are being put into operation are 
considered to be support for the current linking and network 
systems. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Does the Ministry intend to establish an 
apparatus 
to finance and guarantee exports? 
  [Al-Zamil] The Ministry is devoting a great deal of its 
attention to the matter of exports. As I have mentioned 
previously, industrial exports are experiencing noticeable 
growth. There is a table showing how this growth of exports is 
taking place. 
  Petrochemical and fertilizer exports now total more than 
R6.5 
billion. As for the other industries such as those which 
manufacture carpets, cables, electrical appliances, etc., their 
exports total R3.5 billion, and they are continuing to grow. 
  There are two sources for the financing. The first one is 
the 
Islamic Bank program, and it is available to all Saudi plants 
and provides the necessary financing. The second source is the 
Arab Monetary Fund in which there are special amounts set aside 
for Saudi industry. There is also the possibility of increasing 
the sources of this financing, although it is abundant at the 
present time. 
  As for the matter of guaranteeing exports, there exists a 
joint Arab authority whose job it is to do this. But its capital 
is limited and it does not meet the need. Actually there is a 
need to make a study concerning alternatives for this purpose. 
In our meeting with the authorities concerned with exports about 
a month and a half ago, I asked them to study various 
alternatives. In this regard, the commercial banks are prepared 
to provide financing for exports, and it is also possible for 
the banks to make special expertise available to exporters just 
as they do for importers. 
  This matter, in fact, is of concern to the Ministry and the 
Ministry is keeping track of it. 
  [Al-Qaysi] We notice that ministerial decisions are being 
issued concerning exempting some raw materials from customs 
fees, and then the investors are unexpectedly told by the 
Customs Administration that these exemptions are being denied. 
Does Your Excellency wish to comment on this? 
  [Al-Zamil] The Ministry might, in some cases, have some 
points of view that differ from those of the Customs 
Administration. What I said is accurate. But this happens on a 
very limited scale, and these cases involve only 5 percent of 
the exemption decisions. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia is experiencing a high degree of 
advanced industrial progress, and hundreds of plants are being 
built every year. But the Saudi market is still absorbing 
foreign products, and this is having an effect on domestic 
production. How do you think this equation can be solved such 
that protection can be provided for domestic products and in 
order to enable them to develop so that they can compete with 
foreign goods? 
  [Al-Zamil] We in Saudi Arabia do not follow the policy of 
central planning. There are nations who planned and prescribed 
their economic policy on the basis of replacing imported goods 
with domestic goods at any price. And the price was very high 
for these nations and their citizens. What was the result of 
this policy? The result was high-cost industries of poor quality 
that had to be endured by those nations' citizens. Then the time 
came when this reality had to be dealt with. This is what 
happened after the collapse of communism, and it also happened 
in the case of nations such as India and Brazil, whose 
industries were established on the basis of the imposition of 
high customs fees on imported products. When the hour of 
liberation from these policies arrived, all of these industries 
began to collapse and they began suffering because of the 
competition. The reason is that they were trying to pursue an 
unnatural existence, and their industrial development became 
something that was merely tantamount to slogans. There are those 
who said: "We will produce everything from safety pins to 
missiles." Statements like these might keep people quiet and 
satisfied for a while, but surely they will discover that they 
cannot be true and will not yield good results. 
  On the basis of this fact, if I could not produce safety 
pins 
economically, then I should feel free to import safety pins from 
abroad. If I could produce other goods competitively, then I 
should concentrate on the industries that produce those goods. 
This also applies to other things. 
  This being true, we should be realistic and not attempt to 
rely on slogans in the field of growth and development. Growth 
and development are the basis of reality, and reality is 
something that cannot be wiped out by any slogans. 
  It is true that there are a lot of foreign products in the 
Saudi market. But there is a difference between what the 
situation used to be 15 years ago and what it is today. Domestic 
products are steadily increasing. The value in sales of these 
products 15 years ago was R10 million, but today this figure is 
R50 million. This is not something that happened in a vacuum. It 
was the result of tireless labor. 
  At this point I would like to say that the Saudi economy is 
an enormous one and that petroleum is still an international 
commodity and will remain Saudi Arabia's main source of income. 
  The basic point that I want to indicate is that for Saudi 
industry to remain vigorous, it has to develop on sound economic 
bases. And that is what is happening right now. 
  This is why I do not hesitate to cancel any licensed project 
if it was not implemented. There is no emotional tie between me 
and a project. The proprietor of a project is the one who 
decides whether or not the project or enterprise is profitable. 
The result of this is that you will encounter new Saudi products 
in the future. If we visit industrial exhibits every year, we 
find that there are new Saudi products and that industry is 
continuously developing. 
  Our basic task at the present time is to develop this 
industry. For example, when we found that we possessed an 
advantage in the chemical industry, we began undertaking it on a 
grand scale, and we became one of its chief exporters. The same 
applies to fertilizers and other products. Who would have 
expected that Saudi Arabia, which used to import 100 percent of 
its electrical cables, now exports about 30 percent percent of 
its electrical cable production? 
  We will gradually set up more industries in order to reach 
the stage of self-sufficiency in a well-researched and 
scientific manner. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Electricity still has not reached a number of 
villages in Saudi Arabia. How does Your Excellency explain this, 
especially in emergency cases? 
  [Al-Zamil] Saudi Arabia lived through an emergency--the Gulf 
war--which could be considered to have been an extremely 
difficult circumstance. In that emergency, Saudi Arabia proved 
how strong its basic utilities were, whether electricity, 
telephones, or other utilities. Electricity was never cut off 
during the war, but rather was available wherever it was needed. 
As for the matter of providing electricity for all villages and 
agricultural settlements, the fact is that more than 92 percent 
of all of Saudi Arabia's cities, villages, and agricultural 
settlements have power. 
  Right now we have a program called the "generator program." 
It is by means of this program that some remote agricultural 
settlements are borrowing electricity generators that belong to 
the Ministry. This program actually has to deal with great 
difficulties, because it is hard for the parties who borrow the 
generators to operate and maintain them, and this results in a 
lot of problems. Definite conditions are attached to obtaining 
the generators. Any agricultural settlement using a generator 
has to have at least 20 residences and some basic institutions 
such as schools or a mosque. These generators are distributed 
according to need and priorities, and not every request can be 
complied with in a short period of time. 
  [Al-Qaysi] How has Saudi Arabia been able to maintain its 
strong economy in spite of the fact that it has had to deal with 
numerous crises, including such things as the brutal Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait and the sharp decline in oil prices, and in 
spite of the fact that the process of growth, development, and 
modernization is still going on and requires certain 
well-thought-out expenditures? 
  [Al-Zamil] In fact, the Saudi economy has gone through 
various phases and has met with obstacles. We had, for example, 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the consequences of this brutal 
invasion. Saudi Arabia had very great commitments to contend 
with as a result of this invasion that called for total 
expenditures of billions of dollars. These commitments directly 
affected the nation's economy and budget. At the same time there 
was a sharp decline in oil prices. The wisdom and directives of 
King Fahd constituted the main guideline for overcoming these 
difficulties. They were tremendously effective in correctly 
steering the ship of Saudi Arabia's economy. I believe that this 
year's budget has quite clearly demonstrated to the world that 
King Fahd's government is determined to wipe out the negative 
effects of the situation as well as the consequences of the 
Iraqi invasion and the decline in oil prices. The budget has 
shown that the state itself is beginning to cut out unnecessary 
expenditures and concentrate on services that are important to 
our citizens. The budget has provided the world with a 
comprehensive indicator concerning Saudi Arabia's intention to 
reduce its deficit to the lowest possible level. This is a 
reflection of the decision made to have the budget be 20 percent 
lower than last year's budget. 
  In his orientational speech on the occasion of the 
publication of the budget, King Fahd said that the exchange rate 
of the riyal would not be affected and that its value would not 
go down. These measures taken in accordance with King Fahd's 
guidance will strengthen our economic situation both 
domestically and abroad. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Many factory owners are complaining about a lack 
of incentives provided to them by the state, for example, 
hooking up electrical service to the plants. This forces them to 
spend huge amounts of money to obtain such service, as in the 
case of the second industrial city in Riyadh. What are your 
comments about this? 
  [Al-Zamil] The plants in the second industrial city in 
Riyadh 
really did have to deal with an electricity problem, since the 
city had only one transformer station. But due to the huge 
increase in demand by the industrialists, an urgent need arose 
to construct another transformer station. Actually agreement was 
reached to construct two stations--one of them during the second 
phase, and the other one during the third phase. Construction of 
the second phase's station will be completed in the upcoming 
month of Shawwal [April and May of this year]. Furthermore, the 
third phase's station will be put into operation four months 
after that. 
  After these stations have been put into operation, the 
plants 
will no longer have an electricity problem. At this point I 
would like to indicate that the number of plants affected by the 
power problem do not total more than two or three. The other 
plants are still in the construction phase or else are just now 
being completed, and thus have not yet reached the production 
phase. God willing, the electricity problem will be solved 
before these plants reach the production phase. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Industrial and economic analysts are of the 
opinion that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of 
consumer industries and aspires to create industries involving 
inventions and discoveries. But there is no guidance in the 
field of investment industries such as the spare parts industry 
for vital enterprises like the desalinization plants and others 
which, if they ceased operations, would bring the country's 
economic activity to a halt. What are Your Excellency's comments 
about this? Does the Ministry have guidance to offer the 
investment industries? 
  [Al-Zamil] In spite of the great efforts being made by the 
[industrial] exhibits, Saudi industries still are not 
sufficiently well known. There is no doubt that our industry is 
growing in normal fashion, and in accordance with the needs of 
the market. At first the orientation was toward consumer goods. 
We began producing them according to the same specifications 
found in imported goods. Many of the people who own enterprises 
that produce goods were originally importers who then became 
industrialists, and this is an encouraging trend. In the case of 
many products, our Saudi citizens believe that they are 
imported, and it is only after using them that they discover 
that they were made in Saudi Arabia. 
  This enormous process took place gradually until it reached 
the point where we now have an industry that is on the highest 
of levels. This is something that earned the admiration of the 
Greek minister of industry when I accompanied him on a visit to 
the Isma'il Abu-Dawud plant, which makes disposable children's 
diapers in Jeddah and which is considered to be one of the 
world's four largest plants in this field. 
  There is a clear trend in the direction of investment 
industries. This was clearly in evidence in Riyadh's first 
engineering industries exhibit that opened recently, displaying 
the products of many investment industries. For example, we have 
two very advanced plants in al-Jubayl and Yanbu', which were 
constructed via a Saudi-Italian partnership. These two plants 
produce many parts that go into the components of industrial 
plants. Here I would like to point out that [the components of] 
many of the SABIC [Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation] 
plants and their expanded units were manufactured in Saudi 
Arabia. Also, the spare parts that used to be imported are now 
being manufactured domestically. At the present time there is a 
clear trend in the direction of manufacturing these 
semi-finished products. The Ministry is encouraging this trend, 
which saves our country huge amounts of money and also 
contributes toward transferring high technology to our nation. 
So there is an obvious effort being made to concentrate on 
beginning the process of constructing plants that will produce 
industrial spare parts in various fields. 
  [Al-Qaysi] There are initial indications concerning the 
construction of a plant in the eastern region to manufacture 
tires for vehicles. As Your Excellency knows, the tire-producing 
industry requires big quantities of water. To what extent is 
such an enterprise useful to us in light of the fact that the 
Arabian Peninsula is experiencing a water shortage? 
  [Al-Zamil] There is a study and a plan concerning the 
construction of a tire plant. God willing, I hope this project 
will become a reality, especially since SABIC, last month, began 
producing the raw materials, i.e., synthetic rubber. 
  As for the consumption of water, the fact is that most of 
the 
consumption will be covered by the recycling method. In other 
words, the same water will be used again, and purified water 
will be used in the cooling process. This means that it will be 
possible to use purified sewage water in this process since it 
is not a manufacturing process, but is instead basically a 
cooling process. 
  Riyadh and Jeddah both have complete sewage water 
purification plants, and this water is used in the cooling 
process. The result is that fresh drinking water is used only in 
the food and medicine industries. On the strength of this one 
can say that the tire industry uses purified water, via 
recycling, and thus does not consume large quantities of water. 
  [Al-Qaysi] We see that Saudi industry has made great strides 
that have been first-class. But the industrialists and 
businessmen have been complaining a lot, even though they are 
earning lots of money without providing the nation with anything 
in return--such as training Saudi personnel and other activities 
that serve as an impetus for the wheel of progress. What is Your 
Excellency's opinion about this? 
  [Al-Zamil] There is no doubt that the industrialists and 
others are constantly being asked to include the interest of our 
nation among their priorities. The basic issue is perhaps that 
an employee, whether he be in the industrial sector or some 
other sector, not forget that it is his job to serve his 
country, whether this be by making the jobs of [Saudi personnel] 
easier for them or by training them, in accordance with 
available capabilities. In all frankness I must tell you that 
the proportion of Saudis working in the industrial sector is 
higher than the proportion of Saudis in any other sector. Even 
so, I am not satisfied with what this proportion is. I hope that 
our industrialists will intensify and concentrate their efforts 
on attracting young Saudis and a Saudi work force. Actually this 
is a trend that has begun to take shape. The Ministry has begun 
to intensify its efforts, together with the various 
industrialists, to help Saudi citizens in various fields. Of 
course, the proportion of Saudis in the big plants is a high 
one. Most of the technical workers in SABIC are now Saudis. I 
remember when we began working with SABIC, the first thing we 
did was to hire 1,400 young secondary school graduates and 
persons who had completed qualification courses. We concentrated 
on giving them technical training inside Saudi Arabia, in 
cooperation with technical institutes. Then we sent them to the 
United States, Europe, and Japan for training in technical 
professions and vocations. When they returned, they proved their 
efficiency and capability, and they came to have a special 
status in al-Jubayl and Yanbu'. After that there was no need to 
send people abroad for training. The training and education is 
now done in Saudi Arabia. 
  I believe that gradually--and we can benefit from the 
experience of SABIC in this realm--the time will come when we 
will see young Saudis occupying their place in all realms of 
industry. Of course the Ministry, constantly and on every 
occasion, is urging businessmen to open their doors to young 
Saudis to become affiliated with industry. 
  [Al-Qaysi] Everything has both its positive and negative 
aspects, and three negative aspects concerning the Ministry of 
Industry are the following: 
  1. The foreign work force in our small industries 
constitutes 
95 percent of the work force. Why are there no particular 
clauses that stipulate the granting of licenses, which require 
their recipients to hire a certain percentage of Saudi employees? 
  2. There are industrial projects for which licenses have 
been 
granted, but they have not been exploited and remain merely ink 
on paper. Why are such licenses not taken back and then given to 
other citizens who are capable of implementing such projects? 
  3. Plots of land in the industrial areas have been granted 
to 
investors for them to set up plants there, but some of them have 
then sold the land. What about this? 
  [Al-Zamil] Concerning the first question, a job seeker 
naturally prefers that his job be in the large- and medium-sized 
industries, rather than in the small industries, because of the 
advantages that would be offered to him. The Ministry is 
encouraging such people to become affiliated with any industry. 
But they do have freedom of choice. The important thing is that 
there be a job opportunity. 
  As for your second question, I would like to point out that 
the Ministry, after granting a license for any project, follows 
up on that project, and if the project is not implemented, it is 
very easily cancelled. 
  And as for your third question, the sale of land in such 
cases is considered to be a violation and a punishable offense 
for anyone who commits this violation, whether he is a buyer or 
seller, because it is rented land and not allowed to be sold. 
  Naturally there are exceptions, such as when the proprietor 
of the project has already built installations on the land, put 
equipment and machinery there, but, for some reason, was not 
lucky or successful with his project. In such a case he has the 
right to recover the amount paid for the buildings and 
equipment. But the actual sale of the land is a punishable 
offense.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] An official in the Saudi Ministry of Finance and 
National Economy has reported that the total value of Saudi 
imports from the GCC nations (both nationally-produced goods 
from the Gulf nations as well as re-exported goods) during the 
first half of the current year was 2.898 billion riyals [R] 
($775 million), resulting in an increase of 12.6 percent. The 
value of national Gulf goods imported (38.5 percemt) totalled 
R1.116 billion, whereas the re-exported foreign goods from the 
Gulf nations comprised 61.5 percent. 
  The source, in a statement distributed by the SAUDI NEWS 
AGENCY, said that the value of Saudi nationally-produced goods, 
as well as re-exported goods exported to the GCC nations, during 
the first half of the current year totalled R1.943 billion, 
representing a decrease of 4 percent compared with the same time 
period in 1992. Of this total, R1.739 billion were 
nationally-produced Saudi goods, comprising 89.5 percent of 
Saudi Arabia's total exports to the GCC nations, whereas the 
re-exported foreign goods constituted 10.5 percent. 
  The UAE [United Arab Emirates] occupied first place in the 
list. Total Saudi imports from the UAE during the first half of 
the year amounted to R1.903 billion, representing an increase of 
11.6 percent compared with the same time period in 1992. This 
accounted for 66 percent of the total value of the Saudi

"New Budget Announced; Legacy of Previous Budgets: A Solid 
Economy and A Comprehensive Developmental Renaissance"] 
  [Text] The announced budget for the new Hijra [H] year 
1414/1415 [1993/94] underscores the solidity and viability of 
the Saudi economy, despite world developments and conditions 
that envelop it. The most important such developments are lower 
oil prices, the difficulties that the world economy in general 
is encountering that have impacted international economic 
conditions, and the increase in petroleum supply and its 
imports, which accounted this past year for 75 percent of the 
Kingdom's total revenues. That decline in revenues has 
negatively influenced the GNP rate of growth in all sectors of 
the domestic economy whose growth this past year is put at 1 
percent (preliminary estimate). 
  Meanwhile, the private sector grew by a comfortable 5.1 
percent. This rate emphasizes clearly indicates that the private 
sector continues to expand as a basic and strong bulwark of the 
development process. It is also an indication of the continued 
growth of the absorptive capacity of the national economy thanks 
to private investments undertaken in the past few years. 
  It is common knowledge that the Kingdom is undergoing a 
comprehensive developmental and cultural renaissance in all 
sectors, with an equilibrium that reflects the genius of 
planning and the thoroughness of performance at all levels 
continues day after day. The factors of goodness and development 
never cease diligent action, and the forces of habilitation are 
tireless. 
  The general budget, with its facts and figures, embodies the 
sincere efforts of the government of the Custodian of the Two 
Holy Mosques to boost the advancement and improve the quality of 
life of the citizenry; [so much so that] the Kingdom leads the 
countries of the world in citizens' standard of living. 
  It goes without saying that the budget will be implemented 
in 
the form of tangible developmental and cultural accomplishments 
such as those monuments and fortresses of industry and the high 
standards of health, educational, social, cultural, and other 
services. All of this crystallizes in the form of economic 
stability, which is the reality of life in the Kingdom, that 
creates a proper and fitting environment and is one of the 
factors in attracting foreign investment. 
  This study, therefore, focuses on the following points: 

  -  the development of the state budget 
  -  a careful review of previous budgets 
  -  developmental accomplishments 
  -  the role of financing institutions 
  -  economic stability as a factor in attracting foreign 
investments. 

<H5>    Budgetary Development in the Kingdom </H5>
  The Kingdom's interest in fiscal matters began early. The 
Directorate of Finance was created in 1346H [1927], was renamed 
a year later to be the Finance Agency, then became the Ministry 
of Finance by virtue of a Royal Decree issued on 3/4/1351H 
[1932]. The first budget ever was issued that year, during the 
reign of the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz. The budget's term ran from 
1 Sha'ban to 30 Rajab. The first budget had a value of 
106,442,544 Amiri piasters or the then equivalent of 10 million 
silver riyals. The Kingdom's revenues were then derived from 
pilgrimage, customs, alms, and Amiri land holdings. 
  Revenues and expenditures, as dual budgetary components, 
were 
first used in 1367H [1948] and [when the budget] covered the 
period from Muharram to the end of Zul-Hijjah. The budget has 
been issued regularly since then, even though its timing varied 
every now and again. Later, Royal Decree No. 8 of 15 
Jamadi-al-Awwal 1378H [1959], based on Council of Minister's 
Decree No.48 dated 10/5/1378H [1959], mandated that the budget 
be issued on the first of Rajab, spanning the period to the end 
of Jamadi-al-A'khirah. 
  The state's budget was tied to the development plan from the 
year 1390/1391H [1970/71] when the first five-year plan began. 
Budget instructions [then] mandated that it be drafted in tandem 
with the development plan already approved by the Council of 
Ministers by virtue of Decree No.812 of 1390H [1970]. 
  The Kingdom, in accordance with a decree of the Council of 
Ministers in 1407/1408H [1987/88], adopted a fiscal year that 
begins on 10 al-Jaddi (31 December) and ends on 9 al-Jaddi (30 
December). In 1405/1406H [1985/86], the fiscal year used to 
begin in the middle of one Hijra year and end in the middle of 
the following Hijra year. 
<H5>  A Review of Budgetary Figures in Past Years </H5>
  It is common knowledge that revenues and expenditures are 
major indicators that reflect the economy's condition and 
strength. It is no secret that the Kingdom's budget has 
undergone remarkable and tangible changes reflected in 
increasing revenues and escalating expenditures amounting to 
R3,485 billion for the period from 1390H to 1413H [1970-92]. 
  It is be noted that public expenditures have grown 
noticeably 
from R6 billion in [fiscal] year 1389/90H [1969/70] to R298 
billion in the year 1401/1402H [1980/81] and to R196.95 billion 
in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. They stand at R160 billion in the 
budget of the new 1414/1415H [1993/94] year. 
  Revenues, on the other hand, climbed from R6 billion to R340 
billion by 1401/1402H [1980/81] and amounted to R169.150 billion 
in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. 
  It may be said that outlays for various services and sectors 
have continued to rise over the past ywo years despite the 
circumstances experienced by the region, as indicated by the 
[following] cursory review of major budgetary allocations. 
  Defense and security appropriations rose from R54.300 
billion 
in 1412/1413H [1991/92] to R61.636 billion in 1413/1414H 
[1992/93]. Education received R31.100 billion in 1412/1413H 
[1991/92]; rising to R34.093 billion in last year's budget. 
Allocations for health and social development climbed from 
R12.200 billion in the 1412/1413H [1991/92] budget to R14.087 
billion in last year's budget. Allocations for transportation 
and telecommunications grew from R8.300 billion in 1412/1413H 
[1991/92] to R9.078 billion last year. Allocations for economic 
resource development expanded from R8.000 billion to R8.930 
billion; local subsidies from R7.100 billion to R9.176 billion; 
municipal services and water utilities from R6.300 billion to 
R6.980 billion; and infrastructure allocations from R2.100 
billion to R2.095 billion. Other allocations [dropped] from 
R51.600 billion to R50.884 billion. 
  Expenditures for secretariats, municipalities, and water 
utilities are estimated at R5,52698 billion in the fiscal year 
1414/1415H [1993/94]. Allocations for maintenance and management 
contracts and approved construction projects are estimated at 
R43.000 billion. The 22 general organizations authorities are to 
receive R28.000 billion and R387.413 million [as published]. 
  Figures, as they say, are not cut and dry. Rather, they 
reflect the economic state, including the various and numerous 
accomplishments in all fields, sectors, and agencies as the 
following facts would indicate: 

  -  The government extended some $70 billion in long-term soft 
loans to citizens and to companies in order to support domestic 
investments in agriculture, industry, housing, and the 
construction of private hospitals and hotels. Development funds 
will likewise make available some R7.870 billion in 
interest-free soft loans. [as published] 
  -  The hard currency balances of commercial banks in the Kingdom 
exceed $15 billion. 
  -  The Saudi riyal is stable in value and is covered by special 
hard currency reserves of more than $30 billion. 
  -  The Kingdom's foreign assets are valued at $72 billion by the 
end of 1417H [1996], according to IMF sources. 
<H5>  Accomplishments in Development </H5>
<H5>  Industry. </H5>
  The number of operating licensed factories increased from 
199 
in 1390H [1970] to 2,036 in 1413H [1992], in which R138.5 
billion has been invested. 
  The number of food industries multiplied during the 
1401-1413H [1980-92] period from 150 to 320. These industries 
produce milk and milk products, cereal and olive products, 
fodder and carbonated water products, drinking water, meats, 
fish, sweets, and dates. 
  Food processing plants account for 16 percent of all 
factories in the Kingdom. Investments in that sector are 
estimated at about R7.5 billion. 
  The volume [value] of Saudi exports amounted to R3.700 
billion [as published] by the end of 1413H [1992]. 
  The Kingdom has eight industrial cities, covering a total 
area of 54.387 million square meters. Construction of those 
cities began in 1390H [1970]. Three of them were initially 
constructed at Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah followed by others at 
al-Qasim, Ahsa', Mekkah, and Baridah. The cost of those cities 
exceeded R1 billion. 
<H5>  Agriculture. </H5>
  The state encourages citizens to plant the reclaimed land it 
has disbributed to farmers over the years--an amount of 1.8 
million hectares of farm land. This helped increase the size of 
cultivated land from five million hectares to 1.4 million 
hectares by the year 1412/1413H [1991/92]. 
  That strategy has produced outstanding results. The 
production of wheat set a record of 4 million tons. The number 
of wheat farms has increased by 37 percent since 1407H [1986]. 
The standard of crops delivered to the Granary Grinding 
Authority--which is responsible for purchasing the crops--has 
improved at the rate of more than one-half [as published]. 
  Self-sufficiency has been reached in fish and most 
vegetables, fruits, eggs, birds, poultry, and dates. The Kingdom 
is one of the major date producers, with an annual production of 
600,000 tons, most of which is exported to Muslim countries and 
the remainder consumed domestically. 
<H5>  The Desalination Station </H5>
  The daily capacity of water desalination stations expanded 
from 5.1 million gallons to 502 million gallons by 1413H [1992] 
in order to supply the water needs of the citizenry. The volume 
of water used for irrigation is estimated at 12,322 cubic meters 
annually. The Kingdom's output of desalinated water accounts for 
30 percent of world production and ranks first world-wide. 
<H5>  Telephones </H5>
  The number of operating telephone lines increased from 
39,000 
in 1390H [1970] to about 1.45 million in 1413H [1992]. The cost 
of local calls, amounting to R500 million annually, is absorbed 
by the state now that such fees have been abolished by a 
resolution of the Council of Ministers at its meeting on 
20/9/1412H, coinciding with 23/3/1992 AD. 
<H5>  Electricity </H5>
  Power generating capacity expanded from 418 megawatts, 
serving 316,000 subscribers, to about 21,000 megawatts, serving 
some 15 million beneficiaries throughout the Kingdom. 
<H5>  Education </H5>

  The number of schools and colleges increased from 3,107 in 
1390H [1970] to 19,631 in 1413H [1992]. The total number of male 
and female students at all levels of education in the Kingdom 
grew at the annual rate of 8.7 [percent], from 547,000 in 1390H 
[1970] to about 2.5 million in 1413H [1992]. 
  The number of non-university students increased from 528,000 
males and females in 1390H [1970] to 3.397 million in 1413H 
[1992]. The number of male and female university students rose 
from 8,000 in 1390H [1970] to 140,000 in 1413H [1992]. The 
number of universities increased from three in 1390H [1970] to 
seven universities and 14 girls' colleges in 1413H [1992]. 
<H5>  Health </H5>
  The number of hospitals increased from 74 hospitals and 591 
primary health care centers in 1390H [1970] to 272 hospitals and 
3,154 primary health care centers in 1413H [1992]. The number of 
hospital beds in the Kingdom increased from 9,000 to more than 
41,000 in 1413H [1992]. This figure includes Ministry of Health 
hospitals, whose beds increased from 7,165 to about 26,900. The 
number of physicians rose from 1,172 to 26,153 and the number of 
nursing staff members likewise increased from 3,261 to 53,871 
male nurses. The number of technical assistants rose during the 
same period from 1,741 to 29,758. 
<H5>  Athletics </H5>
  They say that a sound body begets a sound mind, prompting 
the 
Kingdom's government to provide all kinds of incentives and 
encouragement for athletes and athletics. As a result, the 
number of gymnasiums increased from 53 in 1390H [1970] to 164 in 
1413H [1992]. Athletic federations increased from five to 20. 
Nineteen youth houses, five neighborhood playgrounds, 17 
athletic and cultural centers, nine literary clubs, nine 
stadiums, two permanent youth camps, and 24 club athletic 
facilities have been constructed and were operational by the end 
of 1413H. 
<H5>  Road and Telecommunications Networks </H5>
  The network of paved roads grew from 8,021 km in 1390H 
[1970] 
to more than 41,000 km in 1412H [1991], thereby connecting all 
cities and most villages in the Kingdom with a network of two- 
or multi-lane paved roads. The network of dirt roads likewise 
grew 25-fold from 2,500 to about 93,000 square km. The number of 
quays at Saudi ports increased from 27 in 1395H [1975] to 179 by 
1413H [1992]--of these, industrial ports account for 45 quays. 
<H5>  The Role of Financing Institutions </H5>
  Numerous financing institutions play a developmental role in 
order to fulfill the desires of residents and raise the standard 
of services by supporting and energizing construction, 
installation, and housing habilitation. Those institutions are 
the Agricultural Bank, the Lending Bank, the Real Estate 
Development Fund, and the Industrial Development Fund. 
  As an example: The Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank has 
distributed as grants a total of R5 million since it was founded 
in 1384H [1964] through the year 1410/1411H [1989/90]. The 
cumulative aggregate of bank grants to farmers amounts to about 
R9.1 billion for the period from 1393/1394H [1973/74] to 
1410/1411H [1990/91]. 
  From its foundation until the year 1412H [1991], the Lending 
Bank has extended more than 155,500 loans for marriage purposes 
as well as R3.964 billion in general loans to 278,186 
beneficiaries. 
  The cumulative aggregate value of loans extended by the Real 
Estate Development Bank since it was established in 1395H [1975] 
until the year 1412H [1991] amounted to R103.277 billion to 
finance the construction of 483,475 housing units. 
  The Industrial Development Fund, since its creation in 1394H 
[1974] and until the end of the fiscal year 1411/1412H 
[1991/92], made available more than R13.9 billion. The Fund is 
primarily concerned with industrial development in the private 
sector. 
<H3>  Economic Stability As A Factor in Attracting Foreign 
Investment </H3>
  The Kingdom enjoys the advantages of a vibrant domestic 
market and notable economic prosperity, making it an attractive 
destination for foreign investments. That, in itself, indicates 
that the Saudi economy enjoys world confidence. International 
reports show that $20 billion in investments has flowed into the 
Kingdom in recent years. It is common knowledge that the 
Kingdom's economic climate is what encouraged investors to boost 
their investments. Inducement incentives include the potential 
for obtaining Industrial Development Fund loans amounting to as 
much as 50 percent of project costs, not to mention the 
availability of economic, technical, and managerial assistance 
from the Fund. Imports required for industrial projects are 
totally free from customs duties. Such imports include 
machinery, tools, equipment, apparatuses, spare parts, and 
semi-manufactured primary raw materials. Foreign capital enjoys 
all the privileges of domestic capital in order to protect and 
support domestic industries. Furthermore, industrial and 
agricultural projects financed [in part] by foreign capital are 
forgiven certain income taxes for a period of 10 years provided 
that domestic capital accounts for no less than 25 percent of 
the [joint] venture. 
  There are numerous advantages, incentives, and facilities 
aimed at promoting investment in the Kingdom. 
  The new budget therefore underscores the absorptive capacity 
of the Saudi national economy and proves to all that the 
faithful sons of this land are capable of overcoming obstacles 
with profound faith and deep determination to achieve desired 
goals.

al-Juhaymi and Mani' al-'Asari in Riyadh; 'Abd-al-Khaliq

'Abdallah al-Rowayli and 'Ali Badir in Tabuk: "Noted Economists 
and Businessmen: The Budget Confirms That Our Economy Is Capable 
of Meeting its Challenges"] 
  [Text] Senior economists and businessmen continue to 
express their views and impressions of the Kingdom's budget for 
the 1414/15H [Hijra] [1993/94] fiscal year. 
  They emphasized that the new budget confirms that the Saudi 
economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present 
and of adapting to new developments. 
  They say that the budget allows the private sector an 
opportunity to contribute effectively to the process of 
development. Following are the views they expressed to 'UKAZ 
AL-IQTISADI. 
<H5>  Facing Reality </H5>
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, chairman of the Council of Saudi 
Chambers [of Commerce] and chairman of the board of the Riyadh 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, began by emphasizing that the 
budget for the new 1414/15H fiscal year confirms that the Saudi 
economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present 
and of adapting to new developments. The Custodian of the Two 
Holy Mosques, may God save him, has enunciated, concisely and 
with great clarity, the economy's current state of affairs and 
its correlation to world developments leading to softening oil 
prices, especially the increase in oil supply and the depressed 
value of the dollar, which is the major currency in which oil 
transactions are denominated. 
  Al-Juraysi added that the new budget entails important 
economic indicators, such as: 

  -  The acumen of the Kingdom's economic policy, which focuses 
on the diversification of the sources of national income as the 
main thrust of all past, present, and future development plans. 
This policy has been a complete success. Thanks to rising GDP in 
all oil and non-oil economic sectors, the rate of GDP growth in 
non-oil sectors has been five times higher than its rate of 
growth in the oil sector over the past 20 years. The rate of GDP 
growth was 377 percent in non-oil sectors compared with only 
about 75 percent in the oil sector. 
  -  The solidity and strength of the Saudi economy and its 
continued growth, despite adverse world economic conditions that 
have impacted most countries of the world, including the 
advanced nations. For instance, the rate of economic growth 
declined in the 24 OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development] states from 1.5 percent in 1992 to 1.1 percent 
in 1993; in the United States from 2.4 percent to 1.5 percent; 
and in Japan from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent. 
  -  Confirm, at the highest official level, the stable value of 
the 
national currency, the Saudi riyal, which the state has not 
devalued as several other nations have. That Royal Majestic 
confirmation by the King will play a fundamental role in 
strengthening the national economy and in maintaining the 
confidence it has earned over the year. 
  -  Underscore confidence in the private sector and its growing 
role in attaining development plan objectives. By casting it 
into the leading role to carry out projects, the private sector 
will be inspired to attain more objectives, especially as the 
state's appreciation of and confidence in businessmen begets 
more giving and loyalty to the motherland. 
  -  Continued state support of development projects. In contrast 
with other budgetary appropriations, allocations for development 
funds were only very imperceptibly lowered this year by no more 
than 2.5 percent. They stand at 7.8 billion riyals [R] compared 
with R8 billion in last year's budget. This is a fundamental 
factor and a strong incentive for the continued blossoming of 
the private sector and for encouraging citizens to invest in 
development projects with soft loans they secure from those 
funds. 
  -  The stability of prices in the Kingdom, despite the increase 
in 
world prices, means that the standard of living will continue at 
its high level. The cost of living in the final month of 1993 
was only 1.8 percent higher than the same month a year 
earlier--a very small increase. 
  The chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers and of the 
Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry emphasized that the 
Saudi economy, with all its sectors and segments, is capable of 
persevering; nay, of taking off to achieve more growth. There is 
no better proof of that than its success in competently and 
efficiently handling the crises it has encountered, especially 
the oil price crisis in the early eighties and the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait crisis and its aftermath in the early 
nineties. 
<H5>  Less Dependence on Oil </H5>
  Dr. 'Abdallah al-Hamad, managing-director of the Arab 
Institute for City Development, said that the three royal 
decrees, the remarks of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, 
and the Ministry of Finance statement that detailed state budget 
revenues and expenses for FY 1414/15H (1994), confirm existing 
confidence in the Saudi national economy and bring all the facts 
to the fore amidst changing world and regional developments, 
especially the decline in oil prices and budget shrinkage to 
R160 billion. This is 30 percent below the previous budget, but 
it also means that the deficit gap has been bridged. It is proof 
positive that the state, represented by the Ministry of Finance 
and Economy and all other relevant agencies, under the 
leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, constantly 
monitors the course of the national economy. 
  He pointed out that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques 
emphasized two points in his brief remarks on that historic 
occasion: the importance of safeguarding the strength of the 
national economy within the limitations of available financial 
resources, and commitment to preserve the current value of the 
riyal without revaluation. 
  He added that those who examine the budget will find that it 
has taken all oil market swings and price fluctuations into 
consideration. 
  The Ministry of Finance statement made it clear that there 
was some tangible decline in dependence on oil, which now 
accounts for 75 percent of revenues. This will be the focus of 
the sixth development plan. It also made it clear that the 
private sector has realized tangible growth of 5.1 percent. 
  The budget set aside R43 billion for expenditure on 
management contracts and previously authorized construction 
projects. The lending funds, be they agricultural, industrial, 
or real estate, and the Lending Bank, were allotted 7.8 billion 
[as published]. All of that would bolster confidence in the 
national economy. 
  The great significance of issuing this year's budget on time 
will be apparent once we realize that several countries have 
actually taken to monthly or extended budgets. 
  He emphasized that the timely announcement of the detailed 
state budget underscores the Kingdom's ability to adapt to 
developments, despite the extraordinary difficulties encountered 
by the world and by the region, of which the Kingdom is a part. 
The Kingdom has confronted the greatest crisis in history during 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and has shouldered the greatest of 
burdens as a result. Difficult times continued with the 
substantial softening of oil prices as they set record lows, in 
addition to fluctuations in the world economy, the outcome of 
the GATT agreement, etc. And yet, the Kingdom was able to 
overcome those obstacles and to support the price of the riyal 
without revaluation. The Kingdom will continue on its course of 
security, safety, and stability and will persevere in adopting a 
market economy, economic diversification, and in expanding the 
private sector and boosting its effectiveness. 
<H5>  Balanced Revenues and Expenditures </H5>
  Dr. Faysal Bin 'Abdallah, vice chancellor of King Sa'ud 
University's College of Engineering in Riyadh, believes that the 
Kingdom's budget, at R160 billion, is of substantial size, 
considering that the Kingdom has already completed big chunks of 
the country's infrastructure. 
  The budget this year is differentiated by balanced revenues 
and expenditures, which means that the state has no need to 
borrow. This is an important indicator of the Saudi economy's 
strength and solidity. 
  He added that, despite the state's financial burdens 
resulting from the Gulf war and from oil prices at record lows, 
budgets in previous years, and the new budget as well, have 
pledged continued effective and rational expenditures on 
building, development, and modernization. They have also been 
keen on maintaining subsidies to development funds, which remain 
the effective player in that respect. 
<H5>  Indications of Riyal Stability </H5>
  Dr. Ibrahim Muhammad al-Qahti, professor of economics at 
King 
Fahd's University of Petroleum and Metallurgy in Dhahran, 
believes that emphasis by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques 
on guaranteeing the stability of the Saudi riyal dinar [as 
published] as it now stands without revaluation is a positive 
indicator of our economy's stability in all domestic and 
international respects and is a most eloquent response to the 
skepticism raised by some doubters. That, he added, gives strong 
impetus to both domestic and foreign investors. 
  On how the private sector can contribute to GDP growth, 
lessen dependence on oil revenues, and diversify sources of 
national income, he said that now is the best time to enter into 
foreign partnerships, especially with Europeans. 
<H5>  Private Sector Growth </H5>
  Salih Bin 'Ali al-Humaydan, deputy secretary general of 
Sharqiyyah Chamber [of Commerce], believes that the most 
outstanding characteristic of the new budget is the substantial 
growth achieved by the private sector at the rate of 5.1 percent 
last year. That rate of growth is expected to go even higher, 
indicating that the state pays great attention to the private 
sector in order that it may perform its targeted role. 
  Al-Humaydan anticipates higher private sector contribution 
to 
the enrichment of our great country. We might perhaps notice 
that the state has lessened dependence on a single source of 
revenues. Oil is only 75 percent; other sources account for the 
remaining 25 percent. 
  The state, as a service to citizens, will carry some R4.5 
billion in subsidies to municipalities and water utilities. The 
state diligently avoids [reducing] projects that would 
contribute to the citizenry's quality of life. 
<H5>  The Deficit Disappears </H5>
  Yusif 'Abd-al-Sattar Maymani, councilman of the al-Madinah 
region; businessman Muhammad As'ad Sharbini, managing director 
of al-Madinah Company for Investment; engineer Mustafa Muhammad 
Balul, managing director of Agriculture and Water in the 
al-Madinah region, businessman Sharif Nayif Bin Jaddum, and 
Tarif Husayn Hashim, secretary general of al-Madinah 
Chamber--all agree that the absence of a budget deficit this 
year is a positive factor that embodies our economy's ability to 
meet all developments and difficult challenges.

<F P=106> [Article by Sulayman Nimr: "New Saudi Budget; Lower </F>
Expenditure, Developing Role of Private Sector"] 
  [Text] The 1994 Saudi budget shows a 20-percent reduction 
in volume of expenditures, according to royal decrees issued by 
the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz. This was done in an emergency session of the 
Saudi Cabinet, chaired by the king and held on 1 January 1994. 
The 1994 budget was allocated 160 billion Saudi riyals [R] 
(approximately $42.66 billion). 
  The substantial reduction in the Saudi budget is due to the 
sharp decline in oil prices during the past three months. The 
price per barrel is less than $13, and this has affected the 
amount of Saudi revenues. King Fahd referred to this in his 
speech on the occasion of issuing the budget. He said that the 
oil economic situation and the drop in world oil prices, 
resulting from increased supply, has affected Saudi income, 
which has been reduced from what it used to be. 
  However, the Saudi king expressed his expectations that the 
present oil situation would not continue as it is now and that 
"this situation will change at a not far distant time, God 
willing, if all oil producing countries sincerely cooperate. We 
hope that this will be achieved." 
  King Fahd stressed the importance of maintaining the 
strength 
of the Saudi economy "within the bounds of available resources." 
He gave support to the value of the Saudi riyal, when he 
stressed the commitment to preserving its value, which has not 
changed since 1986. 
  It was noted in the Saudi budget decrees that no reference 
was made to the true volume of estimated state financial 
revenues during 1994. On the contrary, the Ministry of Finance's 
statement was content to say that "estimated revenue for 
governmental expenditure is R160 billion." This means that the 
Saudi Government will achieve a balance between estimated income 
and spending in the new budget by borrowing, and that the value 
of the deficit that the Saudi budget will experience has not 
been determined because of the fluctuating oil prices. This has 
prevented many countries that are dependent on oil for their 
revenue from determining the size of their financial income. It 
is said that Saudi Arabia depends on oil profits for 75 percent 
of its income. 
  Last year's budget, totalling R197 billion or $52.5 billion, 
had a deficit of R28 billion ($7.4 billion). The Saudi 
Government was forced to borrow from local banks by using 
development bonds to cover last year's deficit. 
  It was noted in the decrees for the new Saudi budget that 
they did not refer to details of expenditures scheduled for each 
sector, such as the education, health, military, or security 
sectors. They only referred to expenditures allocated for 
certain governmental organizations, such as Saudi Airlines, and 
to expenditures for organizations of higher education and 
research centers, which totalled R6.3 billion. 
  Despite the reduced spending in this year's general budget, 
Saudi financial and economic circles have expressed satisfaction 
with its numbers, pointing out that it continues spending for 
operating contracts and construction projects authorized in the 
past. The sum of R43 billion was allocated for them. This shows 
governmental satisfaction vis-a-vis developing and increasing 
the role played by the private sector in local economic 
activity, since this sector has achieved a 5.1-percent growth. 
This means that the reduction of governmental spending in this 
year's budget will be compensated for by the growing economic 
activity of the private sector which, during the past two years, 
has proved its ability to play an important role in economic 
development in the Kingdom. This is especially true since the 
Saudi private sector has high liquidity capable of domestic 
investment, particularly in industry, agriculture, and real 
estate. Unofficial statistics estimate the private sector's 
liquidity at between $14 billion and $20 billion. 
  Immediately after the Gulf war ended in 1991, Saudi markets 
experienced a significant influx into the private sector of 
Saudi capital. This capital had been abroad. This contributed 
considerably to the attainment of reasonable economic growth 
rates in Saudi Arabia which, last year, amounted to 1 percent, 
despite world economic circumstances and the decline in oil 
revenues. 
  In the report of the Saudi Ministry of Finance concerning 
the 
fiscal situation with regard to the 1994 budget, it stated: "The 
1993 fiscal year saw a significant drop in world oil prices. Oil 
represents the state's main financial resource, constituting 75 
percent of total government income. This decline in the rate of 
growth of the gross national product has affected all local 
economic sectors. The growth rate during the past year was 1 
percent, as it was the year before that. This is the first 
report that will be audited and amended in light of final 
figures, after last year's accounts are closed out. However, if 
we look closely at one of the gross domestic product sectors, 
the domestic sector, we find that during 1993, and according to 
initial estimates, its growth was satisfactory, and was 
estimated at 5.1 percent compared with last year's rate. 
  "This rate assures continuation of domestic sector expansion 
and its increased effectiveness. It also proves the continuing 
growth of the national economy's absorbing capacity, as a result 
of domestic investments during the past few years. 
  "It is said that one of the main reasons for this 
improvement 
is price stability, because statistics measuring the costs of 
living show that they continued to be low. The annual increase 
in the last month of 1993 did not exceed 1.8 percent, compared 
with the same month last year. This is a very low percentage 
compared with prevailing rates in most world countries. 
Statistics measuring living costs are obtained by compiling and 
recording the prices of all kinds of necessities of life, 
including housing, food, clothing, and any other requirements 
for life. This measuring statistic represents the rate of 
increase in all these sectors." 
  Saudi financial circles are hopeful that during the second 
half of this year there will be an improvement in world oil 
prices, if all producing states comply with the Gulf initiative 
announced during the Riyadh summit last month. In this 
initiative the Gulf states declared their willingness to reduce 
their oil production levels, if producer nations will also 
comply with that.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Amin in Jeddah: "Kingdom's Balanced Budget </F>
Is Not A Contraction"] 
  [Text] At a time when most countries of the world, both 
developing and advanced, are suffering laggard economic 
performance, high inflation and unemployment rates, and lower 
standards of living as a consequence of continued world economic 
recession, preserving the high standard of living enjoyed by the 
Saudi citizenry in face of these world challenges is considered 
a grand medal that adorns the chest of this noble motherland. It 
is also an accurate indicator of the extent to which the 
leadership of this country, may God save it, is keen on paying 
the utmost attention to whatever is of interest to citizens in 
their daily lives. 
  At a time when the currencies of many advanced nations are 
tumbling, such as the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and 
the collapse of the exchange rate of European currencies last 
August following the decline of the French franc and the pound 
Sterling--that collapse which prompted the Italian lira, the 
Spanish peseta, and the Portuguese escudo to leave the European 
exchange system.... 
  At a time when all this is happening, maintaining the Saudi 
riyal's value vis-a-vis the dollar and other world currencies is 
irrefutable proof of the strength and solidity of the Saudi 
economy in spite of all international and regional challenges. 
  At a time when budget deficits are widening in many 
countries 
of the world--one such country is suffering a $200 billion 
deficit as a result of world economic recession--there was 
earnest intent to prepare a balanced Saudi budget without a 
deficit for the first time in five years. Revenue and 
expenditure estimates balance at 160 billion riyals [R], 
reflecting our astute government's insistence on positioning our 
economy at the head of the economies of the region and of the 
world as far as strength and rate of growth are concerned. It 
also reflects our astute government's care to preserve the high 
standard of living of citizens and residents, and [to protect it 
from] all inflationary measures or additional burdens on 
citizens. 
  Comparative cost of living figures in the Kingdom indicate 
that it continues to be low. The annual increase in the last 
month of this past year did not exceed 1.8 percent in comparison 
with the same month a year earlier [as published]. This rate [of 
increase] is very minuscule in comparison with most countries of 
the world, as the Ministry of Finance and National Economy 
pointed out in its statement accompanying the budget. Doubtless, 
there is no comparison between this rate and the high rates of 
inflation, exceeding 20 or 30 percent in most cases, that are 
scorching numerous nations of the world around us. 
<H5>  R160 Billion For What? </H5>
  [This is the] climate in which the Kingdom's general budget 
for 1414/15H [1993/94] was issued. One may wonder why budget 
estimates settled at R160 billion and no higher. The answer is 
summarized in the remarks made by the Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques in the recent extraordinary session held by the Council 
of Ministers to ratify the budget. 
  He said, may God save him: "When preparing and debating this 
budget, care was taken, as it is every year, to take into 
consideration services to citizens and [to look after] their 
interests in all areas of administrative, educational, and 
health services." 
<H5>  This Is No Contraction </H5>
  World economic conditions and increased petroleum supply 
have 
[adversely] impacted world [oil] prices and depressed our 
country's [oil] revenues even further. 
  There was considerable softening of oil prices last year. 
[Oil] is considered the main source of state income and accounts 
for 75 percent of total state revenues. 
  This past fiscal year closed with crude prices at an average 
of $13.20, or a 40-percent drop from $22.00 at the beginning of 
last year. That was its steepest rate of decline in the past 
five years. 
  It follows, therefore, that this factor would influence our 
revenue in the new budget. This is not to be construed as a move 
towards contraction, since development appropriations were not 
affected. 
  Our astute government has been keen on preserving the 
strength of the national economy within the limitations of 
available resources, and according to the dictate of acumen and 
discernment, without encumbering citizens with tax burdens as 
other countries do, and without impeding the course of 
development in this blessed country. 
  The state had the option, and the right, to impose taxes or 
fees on citizens, residents, and businessmen, or on the services 
it offers gratis, in order to boost revenues, or at least to 
make up for this year's shortfall in public revenues. But our 
leadership is always insistent on lightening the burden of 
citizens in order that they may enjoy a high and stable quality 
of life. It insists, at the same time, on providing the private 
sector with an opportunity to contribute effectively to the 
development process without limitations, impediments, or 
restrictions. 
  This discerning state perception of the private sector's 
role 
is in harmony and in tandem with five-year plan objectives of 
allowing this sector effective participation in the development 
process, as well as with world trends in this direction. 
  Preliminary estimates of private sector performance last 
year 
indicate that it rose up to expectations and accomplished close 
to a 5.1-percent rate of growth from a year earlier. That rate 
confirms the continued expansion of the national economy's 
absorptive capacity thanks to private investments over the past 
few years. 
<H5>  Solid Infrastructure </H5>
  These private sector accomplishments did not come out of 
thin 
air, but are rooted in the solid infrastructure developed by the 
state over the past 20 years at a generous expenditure of $900 
billion (R3.375 trillion). This means that our economy is 
maturing. 
  The state continues to make interest-free soft loans 
available in the new year to citizens and to investors in the 
fields of industry, agriculture, real estate, and lending, 
having appropriated $7.870 billion to the three development 
funds.

<F P=106> [Article by Rashid Hasan: "Saudi Financial Strategy, Area </F>
Changes"] 
  [Text] The 1994 Saudi budget, by the nature of its goals 
and areas of concentration, is considered an important aspect of 
the Saudi Arabian financial strategy. This is because the most 
comprehensive and profound concept of budget ramifications, such 
as political spending, must not stop at the numbers only, but 
rather must consider far-reaching ramifications of many 
indicators, as well as local and international factors, on the 
Kingdom's financial strategy. Some of these realities were 
clearly raised in the new budget, and the influence of certain 
others will not lag far behind in the circumstances of the 
coming stage. 
  One of the most important facets of the 1994 budget is, 
undoubtedly, the considerable cut in government spending (20 
percent), which is down to 160 billion Saudi riyals [R] ($42 
billion). In our view, this rate of reduction means a drop in 
expectations for the Saudi masses, in general, in the next few 
years while, at the same time, creating a basis for permitting 
the Saudi Government once again to realize a surplus in the 
budget, which it can use to eliminate part of the general debt, 
currently estimated at 52 percent of the gross domestic product. 
  The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance, if it wishes, can now 
maintain this rate of spending over the next few years, or 
increase it moderately, profiting from any improvement in oil 
prices and the Kingdom's oil revenues, in order to achieve a 
surplus to be used to reduce the debt and the cost of financing 
that debt. The Ministry of Finance has decided to use this 
option, or to combine it with other means to increase state 
revenues (such as privatization of certain public 
organizations), or stretching out the expenditures on certain 
"flexible" budget items, such as spending for defense systems, 
etc. However, the important thing is that lowering the level of 
spending will allow the Saudi Government to have an immediate 
response to the problem of oil prices and, at the same time, 
expand its ability to move in the future toward reviving the 
financial situation in light of the possibility of improvement 
in oil prices. 
  It could perhaps be useful to repeat here what we said in a 
previous year, to the effect that the most important factor 
concerning the Saudi budget is that--despite its importance--it 
is no longer the singular event on which the future direction of 
Saudi Arabia depends. In fact, the budget used to be the 
decisive event in the first stages of the development process 
and in providing the infrastructure. However, the Saudi state's 
biggest accomplishments have been completed. In its efforts to 
lessen the citizens' and businessmen's dependence on the 
government, it has succeeded in making the budget just one among 
many factors that affect the economy's movement. For two 
decades, the state itself has overseen, under King Fahd's 
personal direction, the composition and growth of a domestic 
sector that increasingly expands and matures each year. Every 
means has been used to encourage it to play a leading role in 
stimulating the economy. Therefore, because of private sector 
investments, we see the importance of the government's burden 
regarding the stimulation of the economy, becoming slightly 
smaller with each new budget. It is sufficient for us to look at 
the considerable growth in the Saudi financial market and the 
movement to capitalize organizations and companies, in order to 
realize the extent of basic development that has suddenly 
occurred in the country. In the past, the Saudi Industrial 
Development Fund, and its generous loans, was an indispensable 
factor in the establishment of projects. Now, the fund has begun 
to finance its own projects and does not now cost the state any 
additional resources. Moreover, the ratio of its participation 
in providing subsidized and long-term financing is gradually 
lessening. Despite that, it has provided excellent opportunities 
for profit, creating corporations specializing in investment and 
creating projects through the increased participation of private 
capital without, at times, waiting to obtain any government 
financing. 
  This great vitality in private sector financing, which has 
been built on a foundation of confidence in political and 
economic stability, is developing a capital market whose 
liquidity adds tens of billions of riyals each year to the 
Kingdom's fixed capital. The amount of the capital market has 
recently reached nearly R200 billion. This figure significantly 
surpasses the amount of the government budget. 
  We can also cite examples of significant growth in Saudi 
industry, with an increased exporting capacity for a number of 
industries in which the Kingdom has marked advantages (such as 
those that strongly rely on oil and its derivatives). 
Furthermore, the increased growth in exports offers an excellent 
indicator of the growth of profit margins and marketing 
expertise of an increasing number of Saudi organizations and of 
the rise in competitive ability of the economy in general. This 
improvement is unobserved year after year, with the Saudi 
organizations benefitting from studies and mistakes in planning, 
thanks to the balanced protection which, although it provides 
additional strength to Saudi products, does not exceed, or 
rather is generally less than, the advantages and protection 
applied in many nations, including those nations to which those 
products are exported. 
  The increased vitality and effectiveness of the economy in 
general, and Saudi organizations in particular, is because of 
the development that the Saudi Government has been creating on 
their behalf. In time, this will allow the government to lessen 
many transitional burdens, which it accepted under the 
circumstances of applying development plans and giving the 
organizations--small and large--suitable time to learn the 
market game and become competitive under the aegis of 
appropriate cover. Without going into detail, areas of 
economizing in spending can be found either through 
privatization of several government assets, through more 
guidance being made available, represented in itself by a 
"hidden force," or through unforeseen reserves in the Saudi 
economy, i.e., the state out of its continued generosity in 
subsidizing specific sectors has, for this reason alone, cards 
that it can use if necessary. In fact, we believe that it has 
begun to be possible to use these cards, because Saudi society 
is over its initial stages of protection and the "stage of 
solicitude," and has become ready to accept the facts as they 
are, as well as being more confident about dealing with them. 
  If some of these domestic realities will help to redirect 
Saudi fiscal policy, there are also international developments 
flowing in this direction. The current and future budgets will 
be prepared under completely different international 
circumstances than those that existed before the end of the Cold 
War and the collapse of regional alliances that it produced. 
  A completely new situation has emerged from the war to 
liberate Kuwait, for example, which will require reconsideration 
of policies and defensive strategies for Saudi Arabia and other 
nations. Consequently, as has happened in all Western countries, 
it might be reflected in a new look at defense and investment in 
regional security. Naturally, on this level, much depends on the 
path of the thorny negotiations aimed at reaching a joint 
settlement of the historic conflict in the Middle East and the 
opening of a new era of mutual coexistence, cooperation, and a 
redirection of the region's wealth and priceless resources to 
growth and prosperity.

  [Text] Dr. Ghazi al-Qusaybi, the Saudi ambassador to 
Britain, denied "categorically" the truth of reports circulated 
by the Western media concerning a Saudi Arabian effort to obtain 
loans to pay off the state's general budget deficit. He asserted 
that "these reports have absolutely no basis in fact. There are 
no negotiations between Saudi Arabia and any Western or 
non-Western banking institution to obtain loans." 
  In an interview conducted by the Arab Department of the 
British Broadcasting Company (BBC) and broadcast on 17 December 
1993, al-Qusaybi said: "The Kingdom has not requested any loans 
from international or financial institutions." He made it clear 
that the "only foreign loan that the Kingdom had previously 
obtained was $4.5 billion. That amount was loaned to the Kingdom 
from abroad, and there is no other loan." 
  Regarding the deficit in Saudi Arabia's general budget, 
al-Qusaybi said: "It is strange that people are discussing it 
now, when in the past six or seven years there has been a 
disparity between expenditures and revenue in the budget. The 
disparity was financed by domestic loans. That was no secret. 
The new matter is that the Kingdom has had to defray huge 
amounts, estimated at $55 billion, which were caused by the Gulf 
crisis. Despite that, it has been able to overcome the crisis." 
  As to the statement of sources of the Bank of International 
Settlements, to the effect that up to November 1993, Saudi 
Arabia had borrowed $2.2 billion, the ambassador said: "In 
recent years the International Settlements Bank has imposed 
standards for the percentage of indebtedness, either domestic or 
foreign, as a kind of guideline, so that the percentage of 
indebtedness should not exceed 60 percent of the gross national 
product. The fact is that the Kingdom's foreign and domestic 
debts, as the bank knows, has not even come close to 60 
percent." Al-Qusaybi reaffirmed that "the Kingdom's foreign 
debts do not exceed $4.5 billion." 
  Ambassador al-Qusaybi said: "The Kingdom has not been 
waiting 
for anyone to express concern or to inform it about its 
responsibilities in this regard." He added that the pressure of 
governmental spending is constant, referring to the fact that it 
is within the context of the government's desire not to do 
anything harmful to the citizens. 
  In response to a question concerning a drop in individual 
income in the Kingdom, al-Qusaybi stated: "The true measure is 
measuring the percentage of inflation. I think that the rate of 
inflation in Saudi Arabia is one of the lowest percentages in 
the world." Regarding the decline of oil prices and the 
influence of that on the Kingdom's economy, the Saudi ambassador 
said: "I believe that we cannot be governed by the day-to-day 
price of oil. Certainly, OPEC will take measures to guarantee 
that the price of oil remains at a reasonable level. What 
happened this week must not, in any case, be a measurement for 
what the oil situation will be in the coming months."

"Saudization of Small Industries is Development's Line of 
Defense; the Japanese Experience Confirms It"] 
  [Text] The development of any society is subject to its own 
hidden energies and capability to renew and progress. Small 
industries develop the private sector, depend upon local 
resources, and do not require specialized skills. The revival in 
those industries satisfies the essential needs of society and 
provides it with job opportunities. 
  There are successful examples of small industries in the 
advanced and developing countries; indeed, the prominent role of 
large-scale and giant industrial projects is the result of the 
development in production equipment produced by the contemporary 
scientific and technological revolution, and the accompanying 
evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has 
affected the role played by small industries, which still help 
to achieve industrial development in particular, and 
comprehensive development in general, in most successful 
experiences in the world. 
  The successful role of small industries in some industrially 
advanced countries such as Japan and Korea had a noteworthy 
effect on these countries' economic growth; in fact, attention 
to these industries was the engine of comprehensive development 
in the industrial sector. 
<H5>  Small Industries and Technological Development </H5>
  There are three major dimensions affecting the technological 
development of small industries: 
  1. Small industries and intermeshed sectors. 
  The intermeshing of sectors in industry is achieved by 
"reciprocal credit" relations between large and small industries 
at the technological and technical aspect, this is, the main 
level, including integration relations, most importantly 
subcontracting. 
  2. Small industries and the question of industrial and 
technological penetration, production equipment, which allow 
small- and medium-sized industries to take part in achieving 
this mission by the manufacture of electrical tools and 
appliances in general, and machine tool industries. 
  3. Small technological industries suitable for 
self-sufficient development. Small industries can be 
incorporated into them through integrated science and technology 
courses starting with technological research and development 
(R&amp;D), including the primary and secondary industrial and 
engineering planning process, and ending with the manufacture of 
technological goods. The course would focus on innovation, 
adaption, and development. 
  This can be illustrated by three basic concepts: 
  Subcontracting. 
  Machine Tool Industries. 
  The role of research, planning, and manufacturing. 
<H5>  Subcontracting </H5>
  Subcontracting consists of one company seeking out another 
to 
produce, at its expense, certain parts or components, or to do 
assembly or partial assembly of some of these parts and 
components, with the aim of incorporating them into a given 
product to be sold by the primary contractor. This usually 
occurs between large installations on one hand and small ones on 
the other. This provides a high degree of specialization, based 
on cooperation in production and investment decisions. From this 
relationship, the parent installation can exercise a large 
amount of control over its contractors through technical, 
financial, marketing, and other links. 
  There are four types of subcontracting: 
  1. Contracting for the manufacture of components, with the 
parent company concentrating on specializing in a limited number 
of phases to produce a certain final product, 
technology-intensive, with assembly, marketing, and after-sale 
services, on research and development. This type of operating 
industry is for minerals, equipment, and appliances. 
  2. Subcontracting for certain productive activities and 
operations in their entirety. This occurs, for example, in the 
cotton textiles industry, where large plants do the spinning, 
with other plants paid to do the weaving; the textiles then go 
to a specialized plant for printing the fabric. 
  3. Subcontracting for assembly operations, with small and 
family projects taking on the assembly of a final product in a 
labor-intensive and skill-intensive way. Examples would be the 
electronics industry, with large plants specializing in the 
production of high-technology components and intensive 
scientific research, such as microchips and transistors, with 
small plants assembling the final product. 
  4. Product subcontracting, with the subcontractor 
manufacturing the entire product, with the role of the parent 
company confined to marketing. This is closer to commercial 
contracting, prevalent in many industries such as the 
ready-to-wear apparel, shoes and leather goods, small motors, 
and some electrical appliances. It is clear from these systems 
that there is a principal base it rests on, which is the 
division of industrial labor, with small plants specializing in 
cheap labor-intensive activities and products, while large 
plants provide the small ones with information, technical 
assistance, and technological know-how, in addition to 
financial, administrative, and marketing facilities. 
  Thus it is possible to link reciprocally industries of 
diverse scale to participate in achieving a high degree of 
integration, particularly through the technological and 
production ties reflected by technical operations. 
<H5>  Merits of the System </H5>
  1. The supply of the goods necessary to complete a 
productive 
and technological course by providing production elements, with 
the aim of producing an unfinished or final product, or 
assembling it, with marketing opportunities, after the provision 
of a funding opportunity and planning requirements, and perhaps 
spare parts and applicances. 
  2. Raising the living standard by: 
  a. Providing additional job opportunities 
  b. Helping to improve competence at the economic level. 
  c. Producing lower-priced basic commodities. 
  d. Generating extra income. 
<H5>  Small Industries in Japan </H5>
  The Japanese experience with small industries has had a 
crucial role in Japanese industrial development. Large plants 
had an effect on small industries, providing them with 
technological know-how, and the needed administrative and 
material assistance. Hence opportunities to adhere to high 
technological standards, quality control, and the assimilation 
of primary technology transfer specifically in providing 
research facilities, and the supplies and equipments themselves, 
the reception of trained people, and sending out of the 
technological leaders of the small projects. After the major 
justifications for subcontracts had revolved around the benefits 
of low wages and production costs, these justifications have 
receded and been replaced by purely technical justifications: 
the benefit from specialized equipment and skills of 
subcontractors, and covering the gap in parent companies' 
productive capacities. This has led to the technological 
development of small industries to decrease costs and the 
improvement of practical management methods such as quality 
control and stock regulation. 
  In Japan, subcontracting has spread to the point where two 
thirds of small- and medium-sized plants in conversion 
industries consist of plants subcontracted by larger plants. The 
total number of plants is estimated at 46,500, with 80 percent 
of them in the ready-to-wear apparel and textile and tool 
industry, with 49 percent of these subcontract plants using 
mechatronic devices, and 36 using computers, and 15 percent 
using robots. 
  Small industries have expanded in India, and strengthened 
their links with large industries. India has made a great effort 
towards an integrated policy to achieve this, with tax 
exemptions for small projects and expanded credit with low 
interest. The specific types of products are limited to small 
projects and the encouragement of "positive buying" of tools and 
equipment, help with raw materials, the offer of special sites 
in industrial zones, and various administrative and consulting 
aids; all this led to an increase in small industries. Therefore 
the number of small projects rose from 60,000 in 1950 to more 
than 1 million in 1983. The productivity of these factories rose 
by five times between 1973 and 1983, the workforce doubled, and 
exports rose six times. 
<H5>  International Subcontracting </H5>
  International subcontracting means an agreement between 
plants located in the advanced, industrialized world, which are 
the primary contractors, and plants located in the Third World, 
which are the subcontracted firms, for the latter plants to 
perform certain operations or activities for the first plant, 
whether by manufacturing certain components or parts, assembling 
a finished product, or producing a whole product with the 
objective of marketing it in the parent company's country. 
  The reason for the spread of international subcontracting is 
the benefit of the cost differential between the advanced 
industrialized countries and the countries of the Third World; 
in other words, benefit from cheap labor for the production of 
"commodity items" for specialized consumption, usually in the 
industrial world. This process relies upon an unequal formula 
for the division of global industrial labor, with the plants of 
the advanced capitalist world specializing in the more 
technologically advanced industries and operations, with the 
transferring out of the less advanced industries and 
operations--the labor-intensive and energy-intensive ones. The 
United States uses this method, and is followed by the countries 
of Western Europe and Japan. Thus these three have developed 
export-directed activities in some Third World countries: 
starting with electronics (such as communications, radio tubes, 
and controlling devices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and 
Mexico, as well as the manufacture of automobile components in 
Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, Thailand, and India). 
  In summation, this part of international subcontracting 
leads 
to an increased dependency on foreign countries, 
technologically, financially, and commercially, with the 
accompanying weakening of the ties between local economic 
sectors. 
<H5>  Machine Tools </H5>
  This is based on tools or capital goods, chiefly electrical 
and non-electrical tools. Machine tools fall into the subsector 
of non-electrical tools, chiefly tools producing chemical goods, 
machine tools, wood manufacturing tools, foodstuff preparation 
tools, agricultural tools and engines, and building and 
construction tools. The major industries necessary for these are 
the iron and steel industry and the engineering industries, 
including electrical and non-electrical tools. And so 
subcontracting has spread in this industry, with the machine 
tool industry divided into two broad sections, one of which is 
metal parts tools and the other being metal shaping tools. Parts 
tools accounted for 75 percent of global production of machine 
tools, and according to the nature of the use, there are 
multi-use tools, multi-purpose tools, universal machines, and 
special-purpose machines. 
  It is clear that the first is used in several industries 
such 
as delivery equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and 
others, while the second in basic, agricultural industries. For 
example, if we wished to produce a certain tool or device, we 
must manufacture parts by thermal treatment of iron, steel, and 
other materials. The assembly of these parts follows. After the 
manufacture of the parts by machine tools, the most important 
parts of the manufacturing process, both in terms of 
manufacturing steps or the workshop, forms the basis of a 
mechanized society. No manufactured commodity comes out of the 
foundry, turning, screening, metal working, and surface stamping 
and coating processes. If you have mastered industrial 
operations, you are able to produce whatever commodity you want. 
<H5>  Research, Planning, and Industrialization Units </H5>
  This is the third axis of development and the technological 
development of small industries. 
  The core of manufacturing is industrial operations, and the 
heart of industrial operations is the building of production 
equipment, or the making of capital goods or equipment. The 
joint equipment components are: motors, generators, energy, 
control and measuring devices, metal and non-metal frameworks. 
To do this, one must have a prior concept of each one, as an 
integrated system, an automated system, capable of being 
assimilated into the major system, which is the production line 
in the factory. Is it feasible to manufacture without planning? 
Is manufacturing activity possible without know-how? And so 
planning is essential to conduct scientific research, whether 
basic or applicative. 
<H5>  The Importance of Small Industries to the Kingdom </H5>
  This part of the study explains the role that small 
industries play in the Kingdom, and which we summarize in the 
following points: 
  1. The Saudi private sector enjoys great financial 
resources, 
exceeding current investment opportunities. The funds are 
seeking new investment opportunities both at home and abroad. 
Small industries represent an investment alternative for the 
absorption of these funds, and can also provide job 
opportunities for job seekers, especially for local technicians 
who have sufficient experience in the field of traditional and 
artisan industries which usually require semi-skilled workers, 
such as the cloak, veil, and carpet industry. In addition, the 
use of private funds toward the establishment of small 
industries provides job opportunities for seekers of employment 
independence, representing gradual progress toward 
industrialization for the Kingdom. 
  2. Subcontracting is a widespread arrangement in the 
Kingdom, 
and, as is well-known, subcontracting happens when a plant moves 
to support production or manufacture specific other parts, and 
the plant uses them to produce a commodity and sell it. It is 
widespread in the Kingdom; one of the most important 
characteristics is the achievement of the best use of capital 
and labor, by benefitting from foreign economies of scale. After 
the establishment of small industries, the helper role of the 
large industries are of the greatest importance to the Kingdom, 
especially in the case of foreign investments. The lack of a 
sector of auxiliary industries--in this case--leads foreign 
investors to bring in contractors from abroad, and this trend 
could weaken the integration among the various productive 
sectors and lead to an increase in foreign workers. This outcome 
is not in line with the Kingdom's development plans, whose 
purpose is to boost the rate of "Saudization" and transfer 
technology; the competitive capability of large industries' 
products depends upon the sector being supplied with parts in 
the needed variety and quality, produced by the small 
industries. In the Kingdom, one may be acquainted with three 
cases, in which the small industries--through subcontracting--to 
play an auxiliary and integrative role for the large industries. 
  The first case: when the large industries face a lack of 
specialized skills or abilities domestically for the production 
of specific parts. Of course it will seek the help of small 
industries in producing some of the parts. 
  The second case: a large organization may have the necessary 
ability and skills to produce the needed parts. But 
this--because of the wide disparity and and required 
quantity--makes the production of them in-house "through the 
organization" an economically unfeasible process, leading to the 
use of small industries to perform the task. 
  The third case: the large industry may have a shortfall in 
productive capacity as the result of an unexpected rise in 
demand for its products. It will turn to small industries to 
help meet the increased demand. 
  3. With the constant growth the Saudi economy has achieved, 
which has led to a marked increase in individual income, we find 
there is a change in the type of consumption among individuals 
in society, towards products which have financial quality. This 
change, of course, provided new investment opportunities that 
small industries can exploit. It is not difficult to define or 
identify a number of consumer goods that small industries can 
manufacture and achieve an economic benefit, "reduced cost." 
  4. The small industries can set up in rural areas, where 
there are raw materials, especially agricultural ones, such as: 
the growing and packaging of dates, and storing vegetables. What 
encourages this is the fact that the small industry profits do 
not depend upon long-term production, meaning that they can 
produce some seasonal commodities for local sale. 
  5. Small industries in the Kingdom play a significant role 
in 
procuring and adapting to technology in some specialized fields. 
So international companies might be more prepared to transfer 
technology to small-scale industrial companies, which do not 
threaten their stake in regional markets, as would be the case 
with large industries. The best example of this is what is 
occurring in the electronics industries and personal accounts, 
and the medical instruments industry. 
  6. There are a number of traditional and artisan industries 
which are still widespread in the Kingdom, such as the 
manufacture of cloaks, veils, and ceramics, whose production 
requires uncomplicated methods which, to a large extent, suit 
the capabilities and capacities of small sectors. Thus the best 
way of preserving these industries is to see that small 
industries produce them. 
  7. Small industries, because of the small scale of 
investment 
in them, may be owned by family members or local individuals, as 
it preserves the extended family system, which is one of the 
good traits of Saudi society, and becomes more important when we 
realize that social values and cultural traditions are 
priceless. They are a trait of personality, or national identity. 
  8. Self-sufficiency in some commodities is still low, 
despite 
the availability of production elements for most of these 
commodities, thus providing investment opportunities for small 
industries. 
  9. The performance level of the free economies influence, to 
a large degree, global economic changes, and possibly small 
industries--through the flexibility they enjoy--can resist the 
fluctuations in economic conditions, adapting better to market 
conditions, compared to large industries, with the expansion of 
the small industry base in the Kingdom. This can gain the Saudi 
economy the ability to withstand global economic upsets. 
<H5>  The Problems of Small Industries </H5>
  Despite the economic distinctions and characteristics and 
the 
role played by small industries in the economy of any country, 
the severity and effect of these problems are greater and 
harsher for small industries, compared to large ones. These 
problems might result from the nature of small industries 
themselves, or of the general environment in which the small 
industries function. A glance at the small industries in the 
Kingdom permits us to learn some of the most important problems 
they face. We must note here that these problems are the outcome 
of some field studies, the practical experiences of some 
businessmen and personal interviews conducted by researchers 
with some businessmen and chamber of commerce and industry 
officials. Some of the major problems are: 
  1. The management of some small industries is centered in 
one 
person, the "owner-manager." He is responsible for management 
and production, marketing and funding. While this person may be 
qualified and brilliant in a position and branches of 
management, he is usually lacking the technical skills for other 
management positions, making his decisions prone to error at 
times. These problems are not limited to the Kingdom alone; many 
countries share them. 
  2. There are no defined programs for the development of the 
small industries, but there are some efforts in the Kingdom to 
seek to develop small industries and give them attention. These 
efforts are exemplified in the Ministry of Industry's policy of 
gathering small industries, by encouraging chambers of commerce 
to prepare a program explaining the benefits from which small 
industries may benefit, and the areas that are relevant, instead 
of explaining the ways in which this industry must act; in 
addition to that, many conferences have been held to explain the 
role of the industries and small plants in development, and the 
problems they face, without these actions leading to the 
enactment of a specific program with goals and a method. 
  3. The policy of investment in the private sector--regulated 
by the Investment Encouragement Statute of 1406H [Hijra] 
[1986]--makes no distinction between small and large industries, 
but is based on the offering of customs exemptions and financial 
concessions for all industrial sectors, regardless of the size 
of the industry. The result of this situation is that the 
statute to encourage investment helps to draw investments into 
large rather than small industries. 
  4. There is insufficient protection for the products of 
small 
"infant industries." This is due to the current Saudi ecnomic 
philosophy of free competition, though the policy does not 
necessarily negate the enactment of an appropriate level of 
temporary protection for these industries by directing aid along 
the lines of countries with free economies, such as the United 
States, or Britain, which has specific programs aimed at 
developing small industries. 
  5. Despite the fact that funding may not be a large obstacle 
for Saudi investors in the industrial sector, the method for 
obtaining it is surrounded by obstacles. The Industrial 
Development Fund, for example, is a major source of funding for 
the industrial sector. Some studies have shown that the Fund's 
measures and the steady drop in loans offered was often forced 
by the facilities various industries can obtain. In light of 
small industries' limited financial capability, and the 
guarantees they must provide, these industries are more 
affected. In addition to that, the small industries have less 
ability to wait very long to obtain lesser funding, compared to 
large industries in 1409H [1989]. Turning to commercial banks, 
their funding is usually limited to short-term funding--"working 
capital." This bars small industries from the funding they need 
for long-term investment. In addition, the guarantees that 
commercial banks demand might exceed the small industry's 
capabilities. And in addition to that, commercial 
banks' interest rates may be high on one hand, and, on the 
other, could cause small industry owners to hold off from 
dealing with them for religious reasons. 
  6. Most small industries tend to be traditional in founding 
their establishments, with diversification, and this could lead 
to a focus on some areas rather than others, and without taking 
into consideration the absorptive energy of the local and 
regional market. This is the result of the absence of defined 
industrial priorities in conformity with the industrialization 
process, and of the newness of industrialization in Saudi 
Arabia. Example: shops for metalsmithing, carpentry, 
measurement, and decor. 
  7. Small industries lack a specialized national workforce in 
development, innovation, and upgrading. If it existed, owners of 
small industries would be slow to hire for several reasons, 
chiefly the fact that the financial costs might not be in line 
with scale of the plant. (1410H [1990]) 
  8. The weak links between the various industries, due to the 
trend, common until recently, of covering the consumer market 
with finished products. This costs the small industries 
investment opportunities linked to production and manufacturing 
to meet the needs of the industrial market, especially in areas 
where primary and intermediate materials are available--the 
petrochemical industry, for example. 
  9. Many small industries function independently in 
production, instead of integrating with large industries. This 
situation could lead to their not benefitting from those 
industries' available raw materials, failure to exploit their 
whole productive capacity, the danger of new brands coming in, 
increases in marketing and transport costs, and failure to 
benefit from the expertise and abilities of large firms. This 
situation could harm small industries by exposing them to 
unequal competition, in terms of size. (1411H [1991]) 
  10. Some have started to plan for small industries, on the 
basis of using low-cost non-Saudi workers. This has resulted in 
the majority of small industry employeess being foreign, which 
is not in conformity with the goals of Saudization development 
plans. 
<H5>  Summary </H5>
  The experience of developing and industrial countries 
confirms the effective role played by small industries in this 
field. The prominent role of large-scale or giant industrial 
projects is the result of the development in production 
equipment produced by the contemporary scientific and 
technological revolution, and the accompanying matching 
evolution in industrial methods and management. None of this has 
affected the role played by small industries, which still help 
to achieve industrial development in particular and 
comprehensive development in general in most successful 
experiences in the world. 
  Small industries have kept their clear and bright role in 
the 
experience of some advanced industrial countries such as Japan 
and Korea. Attention to small industry is the core of 
comprehensive development in the industrial sector, and 
attention begins with a practical tendency with all support and 
protection given to the parts and components industry, as these 
are the manufacturing activities which naturally lend themselves 
to the scale of small industries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan Muhammad Tayib, Saudi Airlines deputy </F>
director general, by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ghamidi; place and date 
not given--first four paragraphs 'UKAZ introduction] 
  [Text] In light of the all-around renaissance our country 
has achieved in many fields, the move towards Saudization has 
begun more urgently to guarantee the continued progress of 
contruction, restoration, and the safeguarding of the cultural 
and developmental gains we have accomplished thus far. 
  This direction has opened the gates of hope wide before the 
youth of this nation to obtain the jobs that best suit their 
capabilities, making them better able to take part actively in 
serving this country and its citizens. 
  Saudi Arabian Airlines is considered one of the leading 
organizations in this field; it has achieved 78 percent 
Saudization, and according to its current plan, this is slated 
to increase to 86 percent by 1415H [1995]. 
  Mr. Hasan Muhammad Tayib, Saudia's deputy director general 
for employee affairs, spoke to us in this interview of the 
philosophy of Saudization which the airlines has carried out, 
and continues to carry out now. 
<H5>  Priority to Saudis </H5>
  [Al-Ghamidi] Now that Saudia has done what everyone wanted 
to 
do, how far has Saudia gone in this direction? 
  [Tayib] The constant instructions of the Custodian of the 
Holy Mosques, God preserve him, on the development of national 
manpower and raising its performance standards, are the engine 
of our strategy in the field of human resources. Saudi Airlines 
has over time focused on their development through its plans for 
the development and training of Saudi persons to take their 
natural place in the company's technical and administrative 
positions. Over the last two decades a number of steps have been 
made in the field of Saudization, in line with the company's 
phases of growth, the evolution of its staff structure, and 
local job market data, all focused on the creation and 
protection of enough job opportunities for Saudis to supplement 
the decrease in expatriate labor. 
<H5>  Training and Development </H5>
  It was our obligation for Saudia to offer our citizens the 
opportunity to join our training and development program in 
various areas of the air transport industry, in accordance with 
the government's policy. For this purpose we established 
training departments in the technical and management fields. We 
have also sent trainees abroad to specialize in all branches and 
activities of this industry that are not found domestically. 
  Turning to the Saudization program plan, a study was 
prepared, the first of its kind, with the cooperation of the 
Manpower Council. It lasted nearly two full years and was aimed 
in general at arriving at an executive plan in a fixed-time 
program that began in 1407H [1987] and is continuing until 1415H 
[1995], with the general average of Saudization of total 
employees inside the Kingdom to be 86 percent by the end of the 
plan. Saudia has completed a major phase of the execution of 
this plan, with 78 percent Saudization; and this will increase 
to 86 percent according to the plan by the end of 1995. 
<H5>  A Badge We Are Proud Of </H5>
  There are positive signs that indicate the acceptance of 
Saudi youth of some of the vocations that they were hesitant 
about before, ending a real obstacle to the implementation of 
the Saudization program, such as jobs in air service and 
accessory office work. 
  It is enough for me to point to the praise, or rather the 
certificate with which Saudia was honored, from His Royal 
Highness Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, minister of interior and 
chairman of the Manpower Council. It showed His Highness's kind 
appreciation for Saudi Airlines' efforts to implement the 
Saudization plan. We consider this a badge on the chest of every 
member of our company who helped to reach the basic goal of 
Saudization. 
<H5>  Practical Solutions </H5>
  [Al-Ghamidi] As an offical and a citizen, how do you view 
the 
extent of Saudization in the private sector? 
  [Tayib] There are numerous efforts being made by official 
and 
national agencies to enact practical solutions to the 
Saudization question in the private sector, such as the national 
labor seminar in the national sector that was held in the 
Institute for Public Administration in January 1992, in which 
they dealt with the extent of participation, the seriousness of 
the effort, and the frankness of receptivity. 
  I sincerely hope these efforts will continue so that we may 
see what they have planned transformed into a living reality. 
  Saudi is carrying out, in this field, the role it was given 
by its membership in this society. In addition to its program, 
it is part of a committee made up of the Interior Ministry, the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Presidency of 
Civil Aviation to put rules and recommendations in place aimed 
at Saudizing jobs at airline agencies and travel agencies. 
<H5>  I Disagree </H5>
  [Al-Ghamidi] Some private sector executives think that Saudi 
employees are not carrying out their proper role, and ask for 
more productivity. How true is this, in light of your own 
experience with Saudi employees? 
  [Tayib] My personal conviction is completely different, and 
it is a conviction formed over long practice, and through varied 
employee experiences. The human element is an important part, 
even the most important element of production, and its profit is 
in conformity with the investment in it, in terms of training 
and development. Some business owners have a capacity for 
patience for projects sometimes, for the profit to show, but 
they hesitate in integrated investment thinking which deals with 
Saudi employees, considering them national human capital. 
  There is a problem of training the national sector, and the 
reasons for it must be studied, and solved; perhaps some are the 
non-existence of specialized, integrated agencies to carry out 
this role, or business's weak conviction of the importance of 
training, or financial reasons. 
  This is in addition to the importance of looking at what is 
expected of Saudi employees who work in travel agencies in which 
Saudi Airlines takes part in accordance with the request of 
travel agents (TACA) [acronym as transliterated] by developing a 
training program covering no less than 25 specialized training 
courses for agency employees alone. 
<H5>  Philosophy of Saudization </H5>
  [Al-Ghamidi] What is the strategy upon which employee 
training is based? 
  [Tayib] The management philosophy of Saudization is based on 
the consideration that the human element is the decisive factor 
in the success or failure of any company. From this standpoint, 
constant training is seen as the basic pillar of its growth and 
the expansion of its facilities and services, especially in an 
industry as highly skilled as air transport. 
  Training is also one of the social goals of Saudization, by 
building and polishing our people's skills and training them to 
work in the company's positions essential for management and 
operating its fleet by using the most modern methods in line 
with the highest international standards and specifications in 
thus industry. The company's training strategy is based on three 
components: 

  -  Operating needs, covering the volume and variety of work 
in the frameworks of both time and place. 
  -  Employment requirements essential for operating requirements, 
including the variety of qualifications needed and the necessary 
expertise and ability for training. 
  -  Methods of modern technology and management thinking, in 
light 
of which we are reviewing the training programs, methods, and 
equipment to suit our technical needs and conceive a method of 
work performance.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Karim: "Rabah Kebir Persona Non Grata in </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] According to a statement issued yesterday in Bonn, 
Rabah Kebir will be forbidden to engage in any political 
activity on German soil. The German foreign minister announced 
that Kebir had made public statements about Algerian political 
matters in a manner conflicting with the foreign policy of the 
German Federal Republic and endangering Germany's interests. 
  The German Foreign Ministry statement added that the 
situation in Algeria was disturbing. Many assassinations of 
foreigners had been reported. The danger to foreigners in 
Algeria, continued the statement, had real effects on German 
citizens. 
  The German Foreign Ministry indicated that Kebir had 
requested political asylum some time ago. The declaration 
forbidding him to engage in political activity on German soil 
follows the statement that AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE carried quoting 
from a close associate of Kebir, the head of the FIS' [Islamic 
Salvation Front] provisional executive body overseas. The 
statement, made in the name of this body, announced that in the 
period between 26 and 31 January, 45 persons had been killed by 
armed groups in Algeria. The source close to Kebir said that the 
executive body was announcing these assassinations but not 
claiming credit for them. 
  The announcement forbidding Kebir to engage in his political 
activities, including contacts with FIS partisans and statements 
to the press, will be made by the interior minister of the state 
of North Rhine-Westphalia, who made the request to the German 
federal foreign minister. Kebir has made the state of North 
Rhine-Westphalia his headquarters since 6 September of last year. 
  Last Saturday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an appeal 
to Europeans in which he indicated that a fundamentalist regime 
might come to power and that this would represent an immediate 
danger to the Mediterranean basin. Referring to the influence of 
the Algerian Islamists, the German chancellor added that the 
missiles that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia 
during the Gulf war could be refurbished and placed in other 
countries. 
  Following these changes in the official German position on 
the presence of Algerian Islamists in Germany, German 
authorities are expected soon to announce a decision forbidding 
Kebir from engaging in political activities. If his request for 
political asylum is rejected, he may be asked to leave German 
territory. One should bear in mind that his German residence 
card has almost expired. 
  Rabah Kebir, 36 years old, a high school teacher, head of 
the 
FIS' information committee following the Batna conference in 
summer 1991, became the FIS's official spokesman after the 
arrest of Abdelkader Hachani. He was placed under house arrest 
in the city of Collo after January 1992. He has lived in Germany 
since August 1992 with his wife and five children after being 
able to leave Algeria in the company of Oussama Abassi. He began 
to move politically in November 1992 and requested political 
asylum from the German authorities. 
  Although he has received no response to date, he continues 
to 
enjoy German laws that allow foreigners to engage in political 
activities normally, including making statements to the press. 
At the end of May 1993, the special court in Algeria sentenced 
him to death in absentia in a case involving the bombing of the 
airport. Through Interpol, Algerian authorities presented the 
German Federal Republic with a request for his detention. 
  The German police detained him on 7 June 1993. He was 
released three months later, on 6 September 1993. The Munich 
court stated that the documents submitted did not prove that 
Kebir had participated in the bombing of the airport. Kebir 
subsequently chose the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he 
has resided until now. 
  Perhaps for security reasons, Rabah Kebir has chosen secrecy 
during the last three months. His contact with the press now 
takes place through one of his close associates. On 17 December, 
he emerged to hold a press conference in Bonn, where he 
enunciated positions described as "a positive turn" in the 
position of the overseas FIS leadership regarding the 
appointment of President Liamine Zeroual and continued dialogue, 
though with conditions. 
  With the decision to forbid Kebir from political activity, 
the EC's appeals to combat violence and terrorism and tighten 
the grip on FIS partisans on European soil have gained a 
response from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after an initial 
step taken by Charles Pasqua [the French interior minister] last 
December.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Karim: "Following FIS Representatives' </F>
Statements Halting Violence, `Armed Islamic Group' Announces It 
Is Decision Maker"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's faxed statement by the Armed Islamic 
Group (GIA) presented the group's stand on dialogue in a way 
that contradicted the view that Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam 
presented last week. The GIA thus is trying to register its 
presence forcefully in preparation for the next phase. 
  Regarding negotiations with the government, the GIA said 
that 
"the mujahidin are those who make the decisions; no one may 
speak as a mujahid or in their name except the GIA--certainly 
not those who live overseas." 
<H5>  Kebir, Haddam Seek To Go It Alone, Obtain Prominence </H5>
  The group, which in the past has announced that it does not 
belong to the FIS, added a warning about how "media glitter and 
the temptation of enticing positions is causing some groups to 
forget our mutual promise to unite the ranks of mujahidin in a 
unified organization. A clique has appeared, alleging that it 
speaks for the mujahidin, in order to participate in talks and 
negotiations with the regime in the manner of the FIS leaders at 
home and abroad." 
  Externally, the GIA's statement goes on to confirm the 
existence of talks with the government--what it terms 
"maneuvers"--saying that it had warned against them, but that 
they have now become a tangible reality through positions taken 
in various places to stop the "jihad" and embark on dialogue 
with the regime. The GIA, which is led by Djaafar Seifalla 
[God's Sword] (called "El Afghani"), was alluding to Rabah 
Kebir's statement linking continued talks by the FIS to the 
extent of Liamine Zeroual's acceptance of the five conditions 
that Ali Benhadj has demanded, as well as to the statement 
against violence that a delegation of FIS representatives made 
overseas through Anwar Haddam. In the latter statement, Haddam 
came out demanding a halt to acts of violence against Algerians 
(civilians and military personnel) and foreigners who did not 
become involved in security operations. The GIA thinks that 
"these men and others are trying to go it alone and obtain 
prominence at the expense of true Islam." 
<H5>  Makhloufi an Intelligence Agent, Traitor </H5>
  On a related matter, the statement mentions what it calls 
"internal maneuvers" that it said coincided with a number of 
maneuvers that Said Makhloufi engineered to split the ranks of 
the mujahidin from within. Among these was the discovery of 
elements that the latter had planted in mujahidin ranks. The 
statement added that 70 of these infiltrated elements had been 
executed and that the others' turn would come--especially that 
of their leader. 
  The statement opens fire on Said Makhloufi, whom it accuses 
of treason and threatens with execution. This seems to explain 
the disputes between the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which is 
said to consist mostly of participants in the Afghan war, and 
the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA), which, according to circulated 
reports, has turned into the FIS' army. Said Makhloufi and 
Abdelkader Chebouti head the latter. 
<H5>  No Presence for FIS and Its Army </H5>
  In an earlier statement, the GIA said that it is not the 
FIS' 
military wing, but an independent group. The same statement, 
issued about two and one-half months ago after the tape by Said 
Makhloufi and the statement by Abdelrezak Redjam, contained 
threats against Makhloufi's group and the "big butcher's 
friends," [as published] whom it described as "opportunistic 
groups whom everyone knows got on the train when it was about to 
pull into its destination." Yesterday's statement, however, did 
not allude to "the big butcher's friends"; it merely described 
Kebir and Haddam, who are close to this current, as "those who 
are seeking to go it alone and become prominent." Also, the GIA 
did not include in its last statement its stress on continuing 
the "jihad," nor did the statement include the words, "No 
dialogue, no compromise, no negotiating, no discussion, no 
handing of power to a neutral government or transition 
government, and no half-solutions"--words that occurred in the 
previous statement. 
  The authors of the latest statement preferred not to use 
these words. The group's concern may be to record its presence 
during this period so that it is not overlooked in any proposed 
solutions to stop the violence. In this context, it has adopted 
the method of intensified media activity. Speaking in an 
interview with AL-WASAT magazine before the date of the national 
convention, one of Djaafar El Afghani's assistants--he said he 
was head of the political and legal committee--tried to claim 
responsibility for all the assassinations reported throughout 
Algeria. He said that although the GIA was founded in 1989, its 
military activity began on 18 December 1991. He added that most 
of its members were Algerians who had been in Afghanistan. 
  Speaking for Djaafar El Afghani about assassinations of 
foreigners, the speaker declared: "We have attacked foreign 
Jews, Christians, and pagans, because they are part of the 
imperialist plot. They represent the vital artery and the heart 
of every occupation, whether external or internal." He added: 
"Those foreigners represent the regime's economic backbone. 
Their safe presence indicates that the country is living in a 
normal state." 
  Responding to a question about possible merger or 
cooperation 
with the army of the FIS, he said: "We wonder who this front is 
to which you are referring and what army it is about which so 
much has been said, especially now that peaceful solutions 
involving capitulation are being brought forward. If anyone has 
something else to say, let him confirm it inside the country in 
the land of fire and dust, not in Intercontinental, Holiday, and 
Hilton hotels." 
  Regarding a possible FIS accommodation with the government, 
he said: "The position of the GIA will be defined by the Shura 
Council of mujahidin and the courts of Islamic law."

<F P=106> [Article by Habit Hannashi: "Government-Opposition Contacts </F>
Have Not Yet Begun"] 
  [Text] Officials of some of the major parties have 
announced that contacts between the political parties and the 
government have not yet revived. Responsible sources in Hamas, 
the Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA), and the National 
Liberation Front (FLN) said that contacts might not begin before 
the new president announces the broad outlines of the policy he 
will follow. 
  Liamine Zeroual has not yet spoken. He has not addressed the 
nation in the week since his appointment as head of state. 
However, the president may address the nation on Tuesday, 8 
February. Some sources say that Zeroual will deliver his "second 
speech to the nation" before 9 February, the second anniversary 
of the declaration of the state of emergency. 
  The big political parties that boycotted the conference say 
they are waiting for concrete political measures that will help 
begin serious dialogue and restore civil peace. This is the 
basic demand before the government now. 
  Officials in National Human Rights Watch, the organization 
directly concerned about such measures to calm the situation, 
say that they "have made steps in this direction and are 
awaiting a response from the authorities." However, they did not 
clarify the nature of these measures and instead denied knowing 
of any amnesty measures that the government has taken or is in 
the process of taking. 
  As for contacts with the FIS, signs of relief are becoming 
increasingly clear. In an interview with AL-WATAN, Youcel El 
Khatib said that the FIS has accepted the principle of dialogue 
and has agreed to participate in bringing the country out of the 
crisis and ending the bloodshed. This statement agrees 
completely with the "declaration against violence" that the 
overseas FIS parliamentary delegation signed on Sunday. In a 
similar interview with the daily AL-MUJAHID, El Khatib said that 
the dialogue with FIS representatives was positive and that the 
FIS personalities enjoyed credibility and were representative of 
the party's base, even if the dialogue did not specifically 
involve Ali Benhadj and Abassi Madani. According to El Khatib, 
"members who are founders and officials of the FIS can be found 
among these personalities," but he refused to give the 
names--"for security reasons," as he said. 
  It appears that the crisis of representation latent in the 
parties, including the FIS, will find a solution. In the wake of 
progress regarding relations with the FIS, El Khatib expressed 
the hope that the major parties would participate in forming the 
transitional National Assembly of 170 seats to be split between 
the political parties and the associations.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Orli 'Azoli-Katz: "I Am for a Return to the </F>
Intifadah"] 
  [Text] Jibril Rajub was the first to hear about the 
slaughter. Five minutes to six, Jerusalem time, the phone rang 
at his home in a Tunis suburb. The report was choppy: Blood in 
the mosque, bodies in the courtyard. The Jewish army is shooting. 
  It was one of his commands that phoned right from the field. 
Rajub jumped out of bed and ran to wake up Chairman 'Arafat. 
  He was born 42 years ago in Hebron. His father and 
grandfather were also born there. He knows the area like the 
palm of his hand. That may be why, after he was expelled from 
there by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] more than seven years 
ago, Yasir 'Arafat made him commander for the West Bank at PLO 
headquarters. 'Arafat listens to him, and in Tunis they say that 
what Jibril says reflects what 'Arafat is thinking. He is 
absolutely loyal to his boss. 
  You have to understand the nature of Jibril's job: The 
person 
responsible for the West Bank in the PLO is also the operations 
officer of the intifadah. At its height, he was the one who 
would relay instructions to the field by satellite telephone. He 
would also dictate the manifestos and plan the operations. "Yes, 
I am a terrorist," he confessed, and there are legal grounds for 
saying so: He spent 17 years in Israeli prisons for planning and 
being involved in attacks. When he was released, he was 
suspected of plotting to assassinate Yitzhaq Shamir and 'Ariq 
Sharon. Defense Minister Moshe 'Arens decided to expel him. 
  When the Oslo talks began, Rajub was the most ardent 
supporter in PLO headquarters of the agreement reached with 
Israel. Since then he has been careful to stay behind the 
curtains and not take a direct part in the negotiations. 
Israelis involved in the agreement remember long night-time 
conversations with him by telephone, especially when the 
negotiations hit a snag, and they were looking for a channel to 
'Arafat. 
  "I felt that the terror and the intifadah had justified 
themselves. We had fought, and now we were going to make peace," 
he said in those days. This week he was singing a different 
tune: "I am stuck here in Tunis while crazy Jews from Brooklyn 
are entering my house in Hebron. Everything is lost, how can we 
continue now?" 
  On the morning of the slaughter he went quickly to Arafat's 
house. Suha opened the door for him. For four hours Suha, Yasir 
'Arafat, and Rajub sat by the telephone trying to gather details 
from Hebron: How many were killed, how many wounded, what was 
the situation in the field? Alongside a list of the dead, they 
began to put together lists of the wounded. 
  The shock was great, and only later did they begin to firm 
up 
their reactions. The opponents of the agreement signed with 
Israel began coming out from where they had dug themselves in. 
And even as his image was burned in effigy by his own countrymen 
calling him "traitor," 'Arafat began releasing radical 
declarations: He swore not to return to the negotiating table 
until Israel did away with the settlements, brought UN troops 
into the field and immediately began negotiating on the final 
agreement--conditions that were unacceptable. 
  Still, 'Arafat was not yet closing the door all the way. At 
the end of the week he hinted to Clinton: "Give me a week or two 
for passions to calm and we will see what will be." He gave 
those Israelis who were in contact with him to understand that 
he did not intend to "break all the dishes." 
  Either way, 'Arafat is trapped. He is now caught between 
American-Egyptian-Israeli pressure from above and the pressure 
of the residents of the territories from below. A difficult and 
fragile moment. So fragile that many Western analysts believe 
that if he does not return to the negotiating table, 'Arafat 
will lose his leadership. 
  Jibril Rajub, 'Arafat's close adviser and confidant, has an 
altogether different interpretation. "I know 'Arafat well," he 
said this week in a special interview with YEDIO'T AHARONOT. 
"'Arafat would prefer to die now and lose his leadership rather 
than be portrayed as a traitor in the eyes of his people. I also 
see the pressures from the field. In the West Bank they do not 
want to hear any more about the agreement with Israel, and 
'Arafat cannot follow through on the agreement without the 
support of the majority of the Palestinian people." 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A terrible thing happened in the mosque, 
but would you miss the opportunity for peace because of one 
madman? 
  [Rajub] First of all, it is now clear that the slaughter was 
carried out in two stages. In the first stage the settlers 
entered the mosque and opened fire, and I also have testimony 
that it was not just the madman Goldstein. Our people who 
escaped from the mosque were killed by IDF soldiers outside. A 
settler kills people at prayer, they flee to save 
themselves--and your soldiers kill them. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The facts that the IDF and the Israeli 
Government have are different. They claim that Baruch Goldstein 
was alone in the mosque. 
  [Rajub] In any case, with whom, precisely, can we now make 
peace? With those from Qiryat Arba' who kill and afterward dance 
and party? Killing people at prayer and afterward celebrating? 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Some of your people killed more than a 
few 
Jews over the last few years. Nevertheless Israel opted for 
peace with you. 
  [Rajub] If we were to kill people at prayer on the Sabbath 
in 
a synagogue, a world war would break out. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The slaughter pains all of us, but try to 
be logical now. What must happen in order for the process to 
continue? 
  [Rajub] Rabin must remove all the settlers from the West 
Bank 
and the Gaza Strip. "Transfer" them to hell. That is what must 
be done. Those settlements are illegal. Move them to Petah Tiqva 
or Tel Aviv, wherever. As long as they are on the West Bank 
there will not be peace. What happened made it very clear to us 
that we cannot coexist together. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You certainly must know that Rabin will 
not dismantle the settlements. 
  [Rajub] If not, we will distribute weapons to the 
Palestinian 
inhabitants and go back to armed struggle. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You mean back to the days of the 
intifadah? 
  [Rajub] Much worse, and I am not prepared to go into detail. 
You are always boasting that you have the tanks and the planes, 
but still there are plans. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You supported the peace agreement and 
said 
it was dear to you. Maybe you can think of a reasonable solution 
that would allow a return to the negotiating table. 
  [Rajub] For six months you have been claiming that you would 
not come to an agreement if there was no protection for the 
Jewish settlers. In order for the Palestinians to have security, 
the Jewish settlers have to be removed from there and you have 
to withdraw the army forces from Jericho and let us come in 
immediately. Look, it is absurd: One of your soldiers was killed 
and you expelled 417 of our people. We also want security. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are encouraging your people to take 
revenge. 
  [Rajub] The people in the field are pressuring me to go back 
to armed struggle. They want revenge but also to protect 
themselves. I am not encouraging them but I understand them. A 
boy spoke to me whose brother was killed in the mosque. His 
father ran to the hospital to give blood and within the hospital 
confines a soldier shot him and killed him, too. How can I tell 
this boy that he cannot take revenge? 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] It is hard to believe a soldier shot 
someone in the hospital. 
  [Rajub] Check with the military administration. The family 
name is Abu-Sanin. The incident occurred in the Al-Ahala 
hospital. A shocking incident. In another family a father of six 
girls and seven boys was killed at prayer. What do I tell the 
orphans? That there is a peace agreement? 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If that is your line, the only thing we 
can look forward to in the area is a bloodbath. Your people will 
kill and so will ours. 
  [Rajub] What I am saying is: Tear down the settlements, give 
us our territory. We do not want to live alongside people who 
kill us. You say they will not tear down the settlements. Then 
there is nothing to talk about. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You sound desperate. 
  [Rajub] I am not desperate. I was born an optimist. You know 
how much effort I put into getting this peace agreement. But 
today I feel they tricked us. I am in the position of field 
commander. I hear what people are saying, how they are 
pressuring. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Are you sorry about the agreement? 
  [Rajub] I was for it, but today I see things differently. It 
cannot be that the army did not cooperate with the madman 
Goldstein. I will explain to you again: The people fled from the 
mosque and the soldiers killed them. Nothing like that happened 
with the Nazis. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are exaggerating. 
  [Rajub] I am not exaggerating. And I am not even talking 
about the fact that the murderer was in uniform, entered a 
mosque during prayers, and no one stopped him. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A commission of inquiry has now been 
appointed. 
  [Rajub] It is an Israeli matter to establish a commission of 
inquiry. Why, for example, were steps not taken against those 
who danced from happiness after the slaughter? Hanan Porat was 
there to encourage them. Can I make peace with someone like 
that? I have a feeling that you have people both in the 
political and diplomatic echelons who have regretted the 
agreement and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If 'Arafat retreats from the agreement, 
politically he is lost. 
  [Rajub] 'Arafat cannot and does not want to keep the 
agreement now. He must first of all provide security to the 
Palestinian people. The situation is critical. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Do you think it is preferable to skip the 
Oslo agreement and get right to work on negotiations for the 
final agreement? 
  [Rajub] I know we have people who want that. I hope that the 
Americans will exert pressure where they have to and that Israel 
removes the settlements. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Rabin also has public opinion and a 
government that he has to watch out for. How can he remove the 
settlements now? 
  [Rajub] If he cannot remove the settlements, he can take the 
Oslo agreement, put it in a picture frame and hang it on the 
wall. 
  [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Jibril, you are a terrorist, you served 
time in prison, you were expelled from your home. You fought and 
were fought against. Peace was so close and you wanted it. Are 
you prepared to give it all up tomorrow? 
  [Rajub] We have done everything. Now the ball is in Israel's 
court.

<F P=106> [Article by Rahel Gini: "Is `Hatiqva' the Hope?"] </F>
  [Text] Only 100 years have passed since Naftali Herz 
Imber's poem, which became the anthem of the Zionist movement, 
was written. A short time historically, but sufficient in order 
to result in the coming together of a group of persons, which 
has the same name as that of the poem (stress on the final 
syllable), confronted by a situation that is an expression of 
the disintegration of that movement, which had constituted the 
basis for the realization of the Zionist dream--and its collapse. 
  The founding conference of the "Hatiqva" [the hope] movement 
was held more than a month ago (6 December 1993) in the Writers' 
House in Tel Aviv (the location, by the way, is not a casual or 
incidental geographic detail). Representatives of tens of 
movements, bodies, and circles that identify themselves as part 
of the broad definition of the national camp arrived there. 
Beginning with the "Sky Blue" circle that is at the left end of 
the right-wing scale, through the youth of the Likud, to the 
"Peace Guard," which calls for separation of the peoples. All of 
them came out of a feeling of public abandonment of persons with 
similar ideological structures, but lacking a unifying roof. 
Representatives of the parties of the right also arrived, and 
MKs [members of Knesset] Rafa'el Eytan and 'Uzi Landau even 
spoke at that event, even though the need for a movement above 
parties testifies, without doubt, that the institutionalized 
parties that they represent do not answer the felt need for the 
unification of the national camp and for much more substantial 
activity for saving Eretz-Yisra'el than what is carried out 
today by the parties. 
  The yearning for unification was expressed in the unclear to 
murky wording of the principles of the movement (see the box), 
in order to allow the members of the various movements, 
including those with a narrow definition of affiliation (such as 
the Circle of Professors for Political and Economic Strength, 
and the "Follow Me" movement of reserve officers), to find a 
place under the roof of Hatiqva. The failed attempt of the "One 
Israel" movement, which was meant to unite the movements of the 
right, led "Hatiqva" to abandon the idea of unification and to 
prefer an unclear formula of cooperation, while maintaining the 
uniqueness of each movement and party that would aid Hatiqva.... 
  The founding conference was preceded by a process of about 
half a year, which began with a modest meeting of the "Ohalo" 
circle. The members of this circle come from the United Kibbutz 
Movement kibbutzim in the Jezreel Valley, the Beyt She'an 
Valley, and the Jordan Valley, and they regard themselves as the 
remnants of the followers of Berl Katznelson and Yitzhak 
Tabenkin, some of the ideological fathers of the Labor Movement. 
Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, a member of Giv'at Hayyim (Me'uhad) and one 
of the founders of the Greater Israel Movement and the Tehiya 
movement, participated in the organization of the "Ohalo" 
circle, and now in the founding of "Hatiqva." He does not see 
any reason for amazement about such an initiative on the part of 
members of the United Kibbutz Movement. Regarding this group of 
persons he says that "it is not we who have changed our 
opinions, the kibbutz movement is the one that has changed its 
opinions." 
  He complains about the loss of activism in the kibbutz 
movement, and of the backpedaling that borders on denial of the 
ideas that Tabenkin expressed when he said that the Jordan River 
is the central avenue of Eretz-Yisra'el. 
  The meetings on the banks of the Kinneret gained momentum. 
The human circle widened and touched other social circles. In 
the same period, Prof. Hillel Weiss published an article in 
HATZOFEH, in which he analyzed the depth of the Zionist crisis 
and offered ideas about the nature of the necessary solution. MK 
Moshe Peled, of Tzomet, who is a member of the "Ohalo" circle, 
made contact with Professor Weiss, a member of Elkanah. "A 
common language was found immediately, and the natural 
continuation of the meetings between us was the holding of a 
meeting between "Ohalo" and the professor." Their meeting was 
the first in a series of meetings, which were joined later by 
other persons, such as the author Moshe Shamir, and Shlomo Baum, 
the second-in-command of the mythological Unit 101, where 
current problems and problems of the generation were discussed 
and clarified; the political-diplomatic threat and the 
spiritual-cultural crisis. The channeling of things to a 
practical direction led to the recognition of the need for a 
secular-national movement that would act and would activate this 
significant segment of the population to thwart the government's 
plans to give up the Golan and Judaea and Samaria. However, says 
MK Moshe Peled, what makes the movement unique is not, at least 
at this stage, the operational aspect, but mainly the 
ideological aspect, which constitutes the basis for the tone of 
the movement. Its roots are in the analysis of the 
national-social crisis, which was defined precisely in the 
article by Efrayim Reiner (HA'ARETZ, 15 November 1993): "Israel 
was made into a post-Zionist society--that is, a civil society 
without a mission, whose sole concern is the concerns of its 
individuals." Prof. Hillel Weiss, who serves as chairman 
(temporary, he emphasizes) of the "Hatiqva" movement, regards 
Reiner's words as an extra-anthropological statement. "As far as 
I know, there is no such state or society anywhere on the globe, 
and there also will not be one." He sees in the concept of 
Israel as a post-Zionist society the troubling spiritual 
tendency to self-destruction, as it finds threatening expression 
in the current antinational process, a process that parallels 
the attempt to establish a different nation. Pathological 
de-Judaization, which is intended to save the Jew from his 
Jewishness. In "Hatiqva" they understand that if it is desired 
to change fundamentally the process of de-Judaization, this 
involves the creation of an educational and cultural system 
different from the existing model. The very model whose products 
the "Hatiqva" spokeswomen Ilana Adam (a teacher of civics, 
history, and political science by profession, at the Ramat 
Eph'al high school) encounters daily. Ilana feels the pain of 
the indifference, the hostility, and the alienation of the youth 
from the language, the culture, and Jewish sources. "An entire 
generation has grown up without a mother tongue, without an 
anthem," she says, bemoaning the failure of the second 
generation of Israelis, of which she is a part, to pass on to 
their children what she terms Yiddishkeit. In the secular 
"Hatiqva," they implement three out of the four principles that 
Rabbi Kook enumerates and defines in relation to 
tradition--consciousness, esteem, love, and observance. For the 
average observant Jew, this phenomenon is grasped at first as an 
ideological dichotomy, perhaps even somewhat schizophrenic, but 
as regards the secular Jew, it is understood as an existential 
dialectic. Efrayim Ben-Hayyim, loosely paraphrasing the words of 
Our Wise Ones of Blessed Memory About the Sabbath, says: "More 
than the Jews observed tradition, the tradition preserved them." 
There also is a bit of the declarative in the appointment of 
Prof. Hillel Weiss, the only one of the leaders of "Hatiqva" who 
wears a yarmulke, as chairman of a secular movement. The process 
of the loss of Jewish identity, they fear, leads necessarily to 
the loss of Jewish existence. They are interested in preventing 
the realization and completion of this process. There is a plan 
to establish an ideological forum and the forming of think-teams 
that will be composed of intellectuals, professors, and 
ideological leaders. They will draw up a long-term and 
comprehensive plan, in several variations, that will include an 
educational, cultural, and even a political system, which will 
make possible attention to and deep grappling with the roots of 
the cultural-spiritual-political crisis. 
  In the shorter term, the goals of "Hatiqva" are to create 
cooperation between the various factors that are operating in 
the field--both parties and extra-parliamentary movements--in 
order to stop the process of making an agreement with the PLO of 
murderers, to topple the government, and to bring about 
elections. Even though these goals are clear to the point of 
being well-worn, and are shared by everyone, the competition 
between the political parties, and especially between the 
leading persons in them, makes the matter complicated to the 
point of paralysis. The need to manoeuver between personal and 
party ego of the components of the various factions, says one of 
the founders of the movement, demands a not inconsiderable 
acrobatic ability in the political circus. On the right, there 
is a worrying geological tendency to turn a point of 
disagreement into an obstacle. In "Hatiqva," they hope to change 
these natural relations and to turn a point of disagreement into 
a cornerstone of creative competition. On the duality of the 
potential, Saint Just said: "...you have the ability to build 
with those very stones either a temple or a burial site." The 
absoluteness of these alternatives was made concrete for the 
national parties in the last elections. It is only to be hoped 
that the process of mourning that was experienced by this public 
and its elected representatives will lead to the necessary 
drawing of conclusions, which will aid somewhat in the coming 
into being of a different personal and political culture, as 
occurred on the left on the eve of the last elections, when it 
understood that the fragmentation would lead it to another term 
in opposition.

<H3>  The Son of the Slave Woman Shall Not Share in the 
Inheritance With My Son [first paragraph is editorial comment] </H3>
  The following words were spoken by Miryam Lapid (in the 
photograph [not reproduced]) at the founding conference of 
Hatiqva in Tel Aviv, about half an hour before her husband and 
her son, Mordecay and Shalom Lapid, may G-d avenge their blood, 
were shot by terrorists at the Harsina intersection in 
Hebron. 
  "For G-d's sake, for G-d's sake," cries Bialiq in his poem. 
"About what?," he continues, "Do not ask, wherever it is! About 
whom? Do not investigate. Whoever has been affected in his heart 
by the trouble of the nation, the camp will gather him up, let 
us not make differences!" 
  Words such as those have been spoken here at the conference. 
But only now, when you heard prose, have I understood that it is 
not enough to shout for help, not enough to describe the 
trouble, rather it is necessary, and this is precisely the main 
thing, to ask about what and about whom. What shall we save and 
with whom shall we save. For unity alone is but nothing. With 
the words "Each man shall help his comrade and will tell his 
brother to be strong," the prophet describes a wonderful 
unity...that exists among the builders of an idol to worship: 
one brings the boards, another brings tools.... 
  Should there be unity in order to bring down the government. 
Is that the message? Is that the goal? Where will the government 
fall? Into the arms of the movement that carried and gave birth 
to the Camp David documents? To the movement that invented the 
"autonomy for angels" (for they are supposed to hover with their 
wings above the ground, as our genius patriots granted autonomy 
"only" to them, and not to the ground under them)? For if with 
G-d's help we topple the government into the hands of the 
founders of the Palestinian state at Camp David (LEGITIMATE 
RIGHTS) [peceding two words in English], there will be no 
greater despair than that. Is it really more pleasant to be 
uprooted by the Likud than by Labor??? 
  Moreover, if it were envisaged that the talks were halted, 
the agreement blew up, there is no autonomy, status quo, would 
the bloodshed cease? Can our eyes not see that the situation 
today is child's play in contrast to what awaits us tomorrow? 
That we will never be able to match their rate of natural 
increase, which is three times ours...even in the area within 
the Green Line, they will be the majority. We can expect 
strangulation from within and intolerable pressure from without. 
  If we are indeed coming to give hope, we must reveal what it 
is. And if we show the people a path and a goal, then it will be 
easier for us to call to the flag, then we will be able to 
gather and to topple the government. 
  From every hill and under every blooming tree we must repeat 
the words of the matriarch Sarah: "For the son of that slave 
woman shall not share in the inheritance with my son, with 
Yitzhaq." This is our peace plan, this is the political, moral, 
humane solution for the two sides. It will bring us all life and 
peace. True, it is not so simple, its implementation is not 
imminent, but if you will it, if you indeed believe and will 
it--it is no dream. [end box] 
  In the labor of translating the short-term goals that were 
noted above--into action--works Moshe Leshem, a reserve colonel, 
who was borrowed from the joint headquarters for the purpose of 
strengthening the movement. He defines his role as 
director-general as an attempt to bring the movement to rise 
from an idea to a living and acting entity, and not to turn into 
another passing episode. A short definition with broad 
technical-organization significance, both from the office 
viewpoint and from the viewpoint of activity in the field. Alon 
Zuntz, a resident of Herzliya, "a quiet citizen who was pulled 
out of his tranquility by the situation," as he puts it, is the 
field person, or, more formally put--the chief of the operations 
branch. Alon--as they say of him--has high operational and 
organizational ability, spiced with a not inconsiderable 
charisma. What guides the character of the action is the attempt 
to activate everyone in the sphere where he wants to act and for 
which he is suited and not to try to tie citizens to activity 
beyond their abilities and their desires. "The average resident 
of Herzliya will not participate in Operation Doubling, but will 
definitely participate in a demonstration near his home, will 
get people to sign, and will send postcards...." Alon began to 
work on establishing a stratified apparatus (regions, 
headquarters, branches, cells), with his activity mainly in the 
center of the country, a population in which there is, as is 
known, a considerable gap between the level of identification 
(which is rather significant) and the level of action, which is 
low. In "Hatiqva," they understand that it is not sufficient to 
run around in the corridors of the Knesset. "It is necessary to 
return to the effective method of Gush Emunim at its beginning, 
and to flood the country with home meetings," recommends Efrayim 
Ben-Hayyim. The realization of the program at the various levels 
requires a technical and economic infrastructure that does not 
yet exist in "Hatiqva."

<H5>  The Principles of the Movement </H5>
  The Jewish Zionist movement is a super-party political 
movement, that aspires to close cooperation between the public 
bodies--organizations, parties, and movements--that accept the 
following principles: 
  1. The Jewish people have the exclusive right of ownership 
over Eretz-Yisra'el, which stems from its religion, its faith, 
and from its historical movement. 
  2. The movement will insist on the extension of Israeli 
sovereignty over all the territories of Eretz-Yisra'el that have 
been in our hands since the Six Days' War--Western 
Eretz-Yisra'el and the Golan. 
  3. The movement opposes vehemently an Arab state west of the 
Jordan, any change in the status of Jerusalem, and the uprooting 
or moving of settlements. 
  4. The movement calls for the unity of the existence of the 
Jewish people, Eretz-Yisra'el, and the heritage of Israel, and 
will act to instill the values of Judaism and Zionism in social 
life, in culture, and in education in Israel. 
  5. The movement calls for the ingathering of the exiles by 
Jewish immigration from all over the world. 
  6. The movement calls for mass settlement throughout 
Eretz-Yisra'el. The movement regards immigration, settlement, 
and loyalty to the Jewish heritage as the three pillars of 
Zionism. 
  7. The movement regards national strength, security, and 
economic independence as the main guarantees of the existence 
and future of the State of Israel. [end box] 
  "Hatiqva"--a few weeks old today, a movement in its infancy, 
with a not inconsiderable number of childhood diseases, an age 
known to be critical. The problematic exists not only at the 
technical-economic level, but, as expected, also at the aspect 
of the human component. Shlomo Baum regards the matter not only 
as expected, but also as necessary: "We are talking about 
activists with a dominant personality, will, and ability to 
influence. If they were lambs, they would go with the flock." 
The heads of "Hatiqva" definitely are not lambs, and Baum finds 
himself reminding them that their goal is to tear up the 
opponents and not each other. He does this out of natural human 
understanding and cumulative experience, both as a commander 
(the reference is to human skill and not the technical ability 
to hand down orders) and in the different organizations to which 
he belonged over long years of activity. "Voluntary 
organizations," he says, "do not fail due to arguments over the 
path and how to follow it. The conditions of the path also are 
not decisive, rather human problems." And with the skill of an 
experienced sapper he deals with the human explosive material 
that threatens more than once to explode. 
  Prof. Hillel Weiss does not see "Hatiqva" as a movement of a 
restricted circle of initiators. "The public is the hope, in 
more than one way, and it will determine the fate of the 
movement. People are waiting for something to happen, that the 
great message will be heard, but they must understand that it is 
they who must sound it." 
  Along with the consciousness of the need for a movement of 
this type, there is a lively awareness among the heads and 
founders of "Hatiqva" of the impediments and the various factors 
that can establish the reality of a gap between the need for a 
movement and its existence. The discussion with those involved 
on the various levels, all those who are trying to bring about 
the narrowing of the abovementioned gap, was accompanied not by 
a tone full of pathos, as might perhaps have been expected, but 
by a somewhat doubtful hope, which perhaps defines the 
difference between the concepts of hope and faith. There is more 
than relevance in the sentence from the Jerusalem Talmud, in the 
Tractate Berakhot: "Let our hope not be of destruction nor of 
despair," or, alternately, it should be hoped that "Hatiqva" is 
the hope.

<F P=106> [Interview with M'Hamed Boucetta, leader of Istiqlal, by </F>
Hamid Barrada and Francois Soudan; place and date not given: 
"Boucetta: `We Are a Bulwark Against Islamism'"] 
  [Text] Morocco. M'Hamed Boucetta, leader of Istiqlal, talks 
about political blockages, Driss Basri, Youssoufi, and his own 
successor. He also has some things to say, especially about 
religion, that will be of interest beyond Morocco's borders.... 
  Since Morocco's political alternation derailed, the country 
has been in a bizarre political situation characterized by a 
twofold anomaly: an all-powerful opposition cheated of the 
chance to govern in the foreseeable future; and a "temporary" 
technocratic government that has every prospect of staying on 
indefinitely. This situation, although detrimental for an 
embryonic democracy, probably is not so very unwelcome to the 
champions of a strong state, the eternal "Makhzen." But how are 
the major opposition parties coping with it? Are they not 
victimized by their own refusal to enter the government last 
November? 
  This question, which was at the heart of the interview with 
Mohamed Elyazghi, leader of the USFP [Socialist Union of Popular 
Forces] (JA No. 1728), is also of concern to M'Hamed Boucetta, 
head of the Istiqlal party. Interesting comparisons can be made 
between their respective responses and the different tones they 
take. The former carries on his shoulders, for better or for 
worse, the ponderous legacy of Abderrahim and Abderrahmane 
(Bouabid and Youssoufi) and takes refuge in wooden rhetoric. The 
latter radiates the pugnacious serenity of someone whose 
political career is all behind him. Jumping ahead of the 
question about his retirement, he confirmed his intention to 
pass the baton of leadership in April. To whom? To M'Hamed 
Diouri. A figure of some public notoriety, the heir apparent is 
not to everyone's liking. But what counts, says the secretary 
general, is whether he's to his own party's liking! 
  More important are M'Hamed Boucetta's observations about 
Islam and Islamism. If Morocco has been immunized against the 
"fundamentalist virus," he never tires of saying, it is because 
of the monarchy, which dominates the religious landscape. Of 
course. But it is another question whether Istiqlal's writ 
extends equally far. The party of Allal el-Fassi has always 
taken to heart its hortatory mission, "praising Good and 
denouncing Evil." Istiqlal's message, the fruit of half a 
century of struggle for freedom, is thought provoking and even 
applicable beyond Morocco's borders. It can be summarized as 
follows: Islam and democracy are not incompatible, so long as 
the citizens are also believers. The corollary, adapted to the 
current turbulent winds of change, is that Islam is too serious 
to be left to the Islamists. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Three months after the fact, don't you 
regret 
not participating in the government? 
  [Boucetta] Absolutely not. Even those in our party and 
elsewhere in the country who had misgivings are convinced now 
that we were right. Everyone realizes it would have been a major 
blunder to accept bad implementation of a constitution that had 
only just been revised, especially in a climate of insecurity. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But now? 
  [Boucetta] One of the main provisions of the new 
constitution 
stipulates that the government must obtain its investiture from 
parliament before it goes to work. Well, what exactly were we 
offered? "Participation" in the government, but without a word 
to say about its composition, the king reserving to himself the 
right to choose a prime minister from outside the ranks of the 
majority. Moreover, participation in the government under these 
conditions would have signified our endorsement of the outcome 
of the elections, and in particular the 17 September indirect 
elections for one-third of the deputies. Unacceptable things 
happened on that occasion, things we could not swallow. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But you realize, at all events, that you 
would not have been able to get a ministry as strategic as 
Interior. 
  [Boucetta] But why not? There's nothing preordained about 
it. 
Every ministry should be put on the table, discussed among the 
responsible leaders, and I can very easily imagine it being 
headed by one of our people. That said, it is not a question of 
individuals or portfolios. The whole question is whether or not 
we in Morocco really want to have a government responsible to 
parliament. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] If you had formed the government, would 
Driss 
Basri have kept Interior? 
  [Boucetta] At this time, I do not think so. Because it is 
that very ministry and its head who by their action or inaction 
were responsible for the recent elections being tainted with 
numerous irregularities. Thus it would have been difficult to 
keep the same man in the same position. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the interior minister only the meticulous 
implementer of what he is told to do, or does he have discretion 
to act? 
  [Boucetta] Listen, I am not putting anyone on trial here. 
Driss Basri in the past has shown himself to be a very 
responsible person; he ably managed and directed his ministry, 
and even succeeded in coming to terms with his adversaries. But 
it also happened that he took initiatives contrary to the spirit 
of democracy and covered up for the unscrupulous actions of 
governors at the time of the elections. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you personally one of those who thinks 
there exists in Morocco a "clandestine single party"--to wit, 
that of the regime? 
  [Boucetta] But it is not clandestine at all! It does its 
work 
in broad daylight. In certain sectors, the apparatus of the 
Interior Ministry operates directly, not through intermediaries. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Isn't it too easy to blame all Morocco's 
problems on Driss Basri? 
  [Boucetta] At bottom, we are not challenging the minister 
but 
rather the government as a whole. At the same time, Driss Basri 
has such great influence on his colleagues that in the last 
analysis everything starts and ends with him. He is omnipresent 
and omnipotent. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Wasn't the Interior Ministry equally 
powerful 
even back when you were in government? 
  [Boucetta] Not to this extent. Since 1984, the last year we 
were part of the government, Interior has brought under its 
control the sectors of housing, infrastructure, and information, 
just to name a few. Quite a lot, really. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] One sometimes has the feeling that the 
parliamentary opposition is creating a great deal of stir 
without getting much in the way of results. After all, the 
government is running things, and your criticisms, confined to 
the legislative chamber, carry hardly any political weight. 
There is something unhealthy in this situation. 
  [Boucetta] It would have been even more unhealthy if we had 
participated in the government and turned parliament into an 
echo chamber! 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What are your current objectives? 
  [Boucetta] We must repair the damage done by the legislative 
elections: in other words, start back at square one and hold new 
elections. Dissolve the chamber, then proceed to a new vote, but 
this time hold transparent and honest elections. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is that realistic? 
  [Boucetta] Of course. The dissolution could be only partial 
and cover, for example, just the seats filled in the 17 
September indirect elections. It can be argued that such a 
decision would be politically wise... At all events, we have 
filed so many appeals for annulment of results that if they were 
all granted the entire composition of the chamber would be 
changed. Certainly the situation is blocked, unhealthy. But this 
can be remedied, if people will just listen to what we are 
saying. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How are your relations with the USFP? Still 
idyllic? 
  [Boucetta] Let us say they are agreeable and cordial. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] To the point of marriage, or just a return 
to 
living together, as in the past? 
  [Boucetta] Nothing is ruled out. But before we think about 
merger, it would be better to increase our joint endeavors in 
every domain. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How did you feel about the resignation of 
Abderrahmane Youssoufi last September? 
  [Boucetta] I was unhappy about it, if only because I had 
become accustomed to working with him on a daily basis for two 
years. While visiting France I took the opportunity to visit 
him, and I think I can say that he has not totally dropped out 
of the political struggle. But it does appear to me that his 
decision not to return to his position as first secretary of the 
USFP is irreversible. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Beyond what his friends are saying for the 
record, what in your opinion led him to resign? 
  [Boucetta] I think I know Si Abderrahmane pretty well. We 
first met back in 1939, when we were attending Marrakech 
college. It is in his character: He reached the point where he 
could not stand the game and its constraints any longer, and he 
disengaged. 
  I did not expect his resignation, but in retrospect it was 
hardly surprising: His reactions in the days just preceding his 
decision should have tipped me off. Several times, in the course 
of meetings with members of the government in the national 
electoral commission, he literally exploded: He found the 
behavior of the regime vis-a-vis USFP, Istiqlal, and even the 
National Rally of Independents [RNI] inadmissible and 
intolerable. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] You are not the sort to quit... 
  [Boucetta] That is right. It is neither in my character nor 
in...my culture. I can resign from a government or from a 
football team, but not from Istiqlal. The party is like a second 
skin to me. I cannot see myself for one second writing the kind 
of letter Si Abderrahmane wrote. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What do you think about the creation of a 
human rights affairs ministry? 
  [Boucetta] It is a good thing. A week before the formation 
of 
the government, we had asked for establishment of a 
parliamentary commission on human rights. The idea was rejected, 
on grounds there was no ministry responsible for human rights 
policy! Now there is. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the naming of a Jewish cabinet 
minister? 
  [Boucetta] It is not a first. Shortly after independence, I 
myself was a member of the government in which Dr. Benzaken also 
served. No problem. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about Serge Berdugo in Tourism? 
  [Boucetta] We know the lad well. We have nothing against 
him. 
He is serious and competent. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Istiqlal's next congress will be held in 
April... 
  [Boucetta] 21-23 April. Let me jump ahead of your question: 
I 
am still determined to step down as secretary-general. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And will your friends let you? 
  [Boucetta] They still refuse to believe it. But I have been 
in the job for 20 years now, and sometimes you have to know when 
to quit. My decision is unalterable. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Who will succeed you? 
  [Boucetta] Mohamed Douiri will certainly stand for the 
position. More precisely, I will support him. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will everyone support him? 
  [Boucetta] I think so. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Even outside the party? 
  [Boucetta] It's the party militants that matter to us! 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what about you? What will you do? 
  [Boucetta] I will continue to be a party militant, of 
course. 
We have a presidency council composed of Istiqlal veterans such 
as Si Boubeker Kadiri and Hachemi Filali. I will sit beside 
them, if the militants agree. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Would you say that Istiqlal is an Islamic 
party? 
  [Boucetta] Absolutely. Istiqlal is totally Islamic. Islam is 
its primary foundation and inspiration. If you reflect on it, 
the question should never even arise in Morocco--and in fact it 
does not. No party can contradict me on this, not even the 
(communist) PPS [Party of Progress and Socialism]. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is your opinion of the Islamists? 
  [Boucetta] I do not understand how they can say that they 
are Muslims while others are not--and I do not accept it. 
Neither do I accept the idea of them establishing a party to 
defend Islam against others. No one has a monopoly on religion. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] So you are against legalization of an 
Islamist party in Morocco? 
  [Boucetta] If Abdesselam Yassine, for example, wants to 
establish a party, I will be the first to support him. But on 
one condition: that it not claim, in its name or program, any 
exclusive monopoly on Islam. The Islamic label belongs to all, 
and thus to no one in particular. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the Algerian FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front]? 
  [Boucetta] Our Algerian brothers have committed the sin of 
inconsistency. One day they legalize the FIS, the next they ban 
it. Once they had legalized it, they should not have banned it. 
But it would have been better to give the party a different 
name: Algerian Salvation Front, for example... 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are the Islamists democrats? 
  [Boucetta] With this type of question, it is best to respond 
on the basis of the specific program of the party concerned, not 
on assumptions or suspicions. We in Istiqlal know something 
about that: For a long time, we were accused of planning to 
establish a one-party system in Morocco. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Your newspapers do not disguise their 
sympathy for Algeria's FIS. 
  [Boucetta] We have been in contact for a long time with the 
FIS, and with the Tunisian Islamists. We have sent lawyers to 
each other's trials, because the most important thing was to 
defend human rights. This position of principle does not mean we 
agree with everything the Maghrebian Islamists say or do. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what if the FIS came to power in 
Algiers? 
  [Boucetta] It would not bother me. It represents the 
electoral majority in Algeria. It also defends a return to 
certain values. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the assassinations of 
intellectuals and foreigners? 
  [Boucetta] We have told our Algerian comrades in the FIS we 
are against all violence, from whatever source. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is Morocco's position on the events in 
Algeria? 
  [Boucetta] That is very difficult to define. I am not sure I 
can tell. Let us just say that we certainly are not taking a 
dynamic position. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] With the FIS in power, would Algeria modify 
its position on the Sahara? 
  [Boucetta] Who can say? Some time ago, I put the question to 
Madani and Benhadj. Their response was evasive. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the coming to power of Liamine Zeroual a 
good thing? 
  [Boucetta] I hope so. But we will have to see how he does 
before we can tell. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will there be a referendum this year in 
[Western] Sahara? 
  [Boucetta] The UN Security Council is wasting enough time 
and 
money on it, it seems. There is talk of setting the referendum 
for the end of June, or even as early as May. Why not? One thing 
is sure: As far as Moroccans are concerned, at this point 
there's no question of leaving Sahara. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Regardless of the results of the referendum? 
  [Boucetta] Regardless of anything that may happen. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are Moroccans upset about Bosnia? 
  [Boucetta] We are very sensitive on the subject. Much more 
so 
than one might think. The imams speak out about this tragedy on 
Fridays in the mosques, and afterwards the faithful are angry 
and upset. I could add that many young people are going as 
volunteers to Sarajevo. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] As they did during the Gulf war? 
  [Boucetta] Yes, there is some parallel. But the war against 
Iraq also had the character of an intra-Arab conflict; in the 
case of Bosnia, there is nothing to offset the powerful feelings 
of indignation and rebellion. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Meaning? 
  [Boucetta] All Moroccans think the reason that the West--of 
which they are a part--and Europe in particular--does not come 
to the rescue of the Bosnians is because they are Muslims. It is 
just as if they were unable to tolerate the existence of this 
Muslim enclave in the heart of Europe, as if the war served as a 
pretext for annihilating this outpost of Islam. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] It seems you are campaigning for the 
prohibition of alcoholic consumption in Morocco. 
  [Boucetta] That is nothing new. In 1977, we offered a bill 
that would accomplish this. Recently we decided to move forward 
with this legislation, and we will present it again to 
parliament before the end of session. The aim is to prohibit the 
production, marketing, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In short, an Islamic state law. 
  [Boucetta] Exactly. An Islamic law. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Some might consider the debate on such 
questions to be sterile, of secondary importance. 
  [Boucetta] Not at all. It is essential. It is precisely when 
one compromises on such social problems that one paves the way 
for the most extremist forms of Islamism. In our view, 
prohibition of alcohol is as essential as defense of the Arabic 
language or respect for the "zakat." 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Do you consider yourselves a bulwark against 
Islamism? 
  [Boucetta] You could say that. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Banning alcohol might hurt tourism... 
  [Boucetta] Non-Muslims will not be affected by this law: 
neither tourists nor our Jewish compatriots. It is just a matter 
of how the regulations are drawn up. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In the eyes of many sub-Saharan Africans, 
Istiqlal is still regarded as the party that champions a 
"Greater Morocco." Do you still aspire to realize the 
cartographic vision of Allal El-Fassi? 
  [Boucetta] The official maps do not represent historical 
Morocco. Our country has been dismembered, carved up by 
colonialism. For example, Mauritania was split off from the 
kingdom: That is the historical truth, even if the issue has 
been more or less resolved by making it an independent state. 
More important, vast territories south of Tindouf were torn away 
from us and given to Algeria when it was a French department. 
The Algerians actually acknowledged this in 1961, when they 
officially requested that discussions on the problem be 
postponed until after independence. Subsequently they reneged, 
and 30 years later the issue is still there. 
  [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you still standing by these claims? 
  [Boucetta] That is not a problem anymore. It is 1994. Our 
task is to build the Maghreb, and in that context, borders will 
be of no importance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In an interview with LE FIGARO, the </F>
Al-Maghrib Bank Governor Emphasized the Spectacular Increase of 
Foreign Investment in Morocco Due to the Speeding-up of 
Privatization at the End of 1993"] 
  [Text] On Friday, Mr. Mohamed Sekkat, governor of the 
Al-Maghrib Bank, emphasized the resumption of foreign investment 
in Morocco at the end of last year, a trend that will be 
intensified by the efforts of the Investment Impetus and 
Follow-Up Committee set up to solve as quickly as possible any 
problems encountered by investors. 
  In an interview with the French daily LE FIGARO, Mr. Sekkat 
indicated that the speeding up of privatization at the end of 
1993 paved the way for a resumption of foreign investments, 
which amounted to $500 million (one-fourth of which was used to 
acquire equity in privatized companies), compared with $460 
million in 1992. 
  This is the equivalent of 5.029 billion dirhams, reflecting 
a 
"still more spectacular" 15.9-percent increase, according to the 
central bank governor. 
  To reinforce this trend, Mr. Sekkat said, the Al-Maghrib 
Bank 
set up an Investment Impetus and Follow-Up Committee comprising 
the directors of the seven leading Moroccan bank; their 
objective is to "solve problems" that may crop up either when 
projects are being worked out--"financial engineering is not 
always up to what investors would expect"--or when applying for 
the various local, regional, and other permits. 
  The Al-Maghrib Bank governor also expects growth to improve 
as a result of adequate rainfall, if it keeps up "at least until 
the end of March." "If that is the case, growth might range 
between 7.5 and 10 percent." 
  Mr. Sekkat also mentioned a projected reduction of the 
budget 
deficit to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, which will 
enable the Treasury to make "less extensive use" of bank 
financing and thus "promote a rollback" of interest rates. 
  As for foreign-currency reserves, they increased by $300 
million in 1993, to $3.8 billion, the Al-Maghrib Bank governor 
also indicated.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcel Herzog: "Long Live the SAP (Structural </F>
Adjustment Program)!"--first paragraph is LA VIE ECONOMIQUE 
introduction] 
  [Text] On 13 January 1994, a daily newspaper published a 
long study by Mr. Mohamed Said Saadi, entitled: "The Limitations 
of Structural Adjustment in Morocco." In that article, we found 
many questionable passages. 
  Citing exogenous factors that enhanced the positive results 
of the SAP (Editor's note: Mr. Saadi write "la SAP" (Structural 
Adjustment Policy), but actually it is "le SAP" (Structural 
Adjustment Program)), Mr. Saadi enumerates: "Exceptional weather 
conditions, favorable worldwide economic conditions, 1985 
aftereffects of the oil crisis, rescheduling of the foreign 
debt, and cancellation of $2.8 billion in debts owed by Morocco 
to Saudi Arabia, all these helped achieve the above-mentioned 
financial results." 
  We shall remember, therefore, that some of the SAP positive 
results are due to external conditions. 
  Second, Mr. Saadi writes: "The Moroccan economy experienced 
growth rates that were modest (3.5 to 4.0 percent during the 
eighties, and only 2.0 percent on the average in recent years!) 
and uneven (negative growth in 1983, 1987, and 1992; near 
stagnation in 1993). If we compare these rates with demographic 
growth rates (2.6 percent), we realize that per capita income 
remained practically stagnant during that period." 
  Curiously enough, the author does not mention the growth 
rates experienced since 1988. They were as follows: 1988: 10.4 
percent; 1989: 2.5 percent; 1990: 3.7 percent; 1991: 5.1 percent. 
  In other words, from 1988 to 1991 the GDP [gross domestic 
product] rose by 11 percent in constant dirhams [DH] (from 
DH101.525 to DH113.460 billion) over a three-year period; if we 
take 1987 as a basis, the GDP grew by 23.4 percent in four 
years! For Mr. Saadi, it is an established fact that the GDP 
growth rate is low: "The low GDP growth rate," he writes, "is 
due first to the fact that Moroccan economy is very vulnerable 
to weather conditions and to economic conditions worldwide. But 
the SAP also contributed to it in two ways: on the one hand, it 
increased the involvement of Moroccan economy on the world 
market, based on ill-advised specialization in low value-added 
products, the prices of which fluctuate considerably on the 
world market; second, it triggered a shrinkage of the domestic 
demand as a result of the austerity imposed to the 
State--especially as far as economic intervention is 
concerned--and to low-income social strata. 
  The author overlooks the disastrous harvest of 1992--and the 
1993 harvest as well--although he just wrote that the SAP 
benefited from "exceptional" weather conditions. Actually, these 
exceptional conditions did not bring about good harvests, but 
bad ones. Besides, here are the results for the four leading 
grains (in million quintals): 1987: 42.1; 1988: 78.3; 1989: 
73.3; 1990: 61.9; 1991: 85.3; 1992: 28.6 [sic]. 
  As for the "shrinkage of the domestic demand as a result of 
the austerity imposed to the State," here are accurate figures: 
  1. Government expenditures (GDP) (in constant dirhams): 
1988: 
DH15.521 [billion]; 1989: 16.303; 1990: 16.572; 1991: 17.343; 
1992: 18.210. 
  That is a constant progression (even in 1992); compared with 
1988, it amounts to 17.3 percent. It is not a lot and undeniably 
an effort was made to reduce State expenditures, but you cannot 
waste money during a restructuring period. 
  2. Household consumption (in billions of constant dirhams): 
1988: 115.989; 1989: 127.197; 1990: 138.720; 1991: 160.742; 
1992: 159.667. 
  Obviously, there was a marked shrinkage in 1992, but that 
was 
the year when the rural world saw its resources cut by DH9 
billion compared with 1991. But can we really say that there was 
a "domestic shrinkage" during the four previous years? Besides, 
as can be seen, the 1992 shrinkage was due to the poor harvest, 
not to the SAP as Mr. Saadi would have us believe. 
  As for the development of exports achieved by the SAP 
through 
deregulation and devaluation of the dirham, it is, he writes, 
"characterized by its weakness and it does not reflect an 
improvement in the economic competitiveness of the Moroccan 
economy at international level." 
  Mr. Saadi mentions the textile industry, "which suffers both 
from the depressed climate that prevails on foreign markets and 
from strong foreign competition," in spite of which he notes 
that "the increase in exports during the second half of the 
eighties was due mostly to an increase in worldwide demand...." 
Morocco's lack of competitiveness, according to Mr. Saadi, comes 
from the fact that "the SAP completely overlooked the question 
of the creation of a local scientific and technical potential, 
and even specific problems that plague the industry," and he 
added that the SAP "contributed to the deterioration of human 
resources through the severe cuts it made in the budgets of 
social services (especially education and health budgets)" (see 
Table 1). Since 1988, credits allocated to National Education 
were increased by 58.2 percent; those allocated to Health, by 
77.1 percent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Mr. Saadi goes on: "Another indicator of the negative impact 
of the SAP on the growth of productive forces is the stagnation 
of the investment rate" (Ratio of the GFCF [gross fixed capital 
formation] to the GDP: 22.2 percent in 1980; 23 percent in 1985; 
and 23 percent in 1992)." [punctuation marks as published] 
  Compared with the statistics published by the Ministry of 
Planning ("Morocco in Figures"), these figures are not accurate. 
Here are the figures we found (in current dirhams: 


Table 2 - GFCF and GDP Increases (Billion Dirhams) 

                         GFCF              GDP                Ratio

1985                     24.724            119.658            20.7%

[.sup]1.[/] For information only. 


  The GDP increased by 246 percent in 12 years, and the GFCF 
by 
278 percent. Let us overlook "the SAP low impact" on agriculture 
(although "by eliminating subsidies for fertilizer and seed, it 
furthered a production cost increase"). Note that the 1994 
Finance Law eliminates the PFI [import tax levy] and the 
value-added tax on fertilizer. As for the processing industry, 
"it is still handicapped by its low integration level, the 
uneven development of its branches, and it strong dependence on 
foreign suppliers of capital goods and inputs (raw materials, 
intermediate products), and its reorientation toward foreign 
markets was not enough to offset the negative impact of the 
shrinking domestic market; all this accounts for the low 
industrial growth rate experienced during the last 10 years (3.8 
percent during the eighties, and 2.5 percent from 1990 to 1992)." 
  Let us take another look at the GDP figures (in constant 
dirhams) for the industry, during the nineties: 1990: DH40,284.2 
million; 1991: DH42,845.1 million; 1992: DH45,015.1 million. 
  Let us say it again: The industrial growth rate was 6.35 
percent in 1991, and 5.1 percent in 1992, in constant dirhams, 
which is far more than the results quoted by Mr. Saadi who, 
still with the same bias, goes on to consider the foreign debt 
problem. Here is what he has to say: "Although the SAP was 
supposed to settle the foreign debt issue once and for all and 
restore Morocco's solvency, it appears that, after 10 years of 
structural adjustment, the foreign debt level remains 
particularly high ($21.3 billion in 1992). Certainly, the 
foreign debt/GDP ratio declined from 97 percent in 1983 to 78 
percent in 1992, but the debt still places a burden on the State 
budget and on the balance of payment, and we should expect this 
burden to increase, as Morocco decided that, starting in 1993, 
it would no longer reschedule its foreign debt (as an example, 
it is expected that 19 percent of all the 1994 State budget 
resources will be earmarked to cover the foreign debt, which 
represents a considerable reduction of the resources available 
to stimulate the economy and start solving social problems)." 
  Mr. Saadi probably imagined that the objective of the SAP 
was 
to obliterate the foreign debt. Actually, it was to enable 
Morocco to honor its signature. It did so, which greatly 
enhanced its credibility and the confidence it inspires in 
investors. 
  Certainly, the debt is a heavy burden, and if we listened to 
Mr. Saadi, who denounces "the drop in public investments" during 
the eighties, it would be still higher. 
  But our economist has a ready solution. You read it right: 
the foreign debt service "represents a considerable reduction of 
the resources available to stimulate the economy and start 
solving social problems." The message is clear. You see, all we 
have to do is eliminate that reduction, reschedule again, in 
other words, not pay what we owe. 
  But eventually Morocco will pay a high, a very high price 
for 
such an irresponsible attitude (not to use another word). 
Therefore, let us clean up the mess. And long live the SAP!

<F P=106> [Appeal by Malika, Myriem, Raouf, Maria-Inan, Soukaina, and </F>
Abdelatif Oufkir: "For Justice To Be Done"--first paragraph is 
LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] The children of Morocco's former interior minister, 
General Mohamed Oufkir, who is said to have committed suicide in 
August 1972, the day after the attack on the king's airplane, 
have now been set free. But they claim their right to lead a 
normal life and in particular the right to a passport enabling 
them to come and go. On the third anniversary of their release, 
they sent us this appeal. 
  For the second time, having exhausted all hope, we make this 
appeal to recover our full freedom and the right to a life as 
normal as possible, if that still means anything after 19 years 
of "disappearance" and detention for the only crime of bearing 
our father's name. 
  In 1987, having managed to dig a tunnel, it was to escape 
death among universal oblivion and to break the wall of silence 
that four of us got away from the Bir-Jdid camp, south of 
Casablanca, leaving behind the walls, watch towers, and barbed 
wires. After wandering for three days through our country, it 
was from Tangiers that we managed to send a "call for help" and 
express our most complete failure to understand what was 
happening to us. 
  In fact, in 1972, when we were "taken away," the oldest of 
us 
(a girl) was 18, and the youngest (a boy) two and a half. In a 
state of utter confusion, we wept, saying: "We are innocent.... 
Do you believe that children could be responsible for any such 
thing? We implore you to give us justice..." 
  Soon arrested again in Tangiers, we did not remain at the 
Bir-Jdid camp. We were put in a farm near Marrakech where, for 
four and a half years, we lived under strict house arrest, with 
all the comfort we needed, but without ever going out. Four 
years and a half, after 15 long years of suffering. Meanwhile, 
the whole world knew, and we kept saying in our despair, that 
our only wish was "to recover our freedom and our rights, and to 
be able to live under our name, something for which we paid with 
our tears, our blood, and the best years of our lives." 
<H5>  The Right To Exist </H5>
  It was only on 26 February 1991, three years ago, that we 
were taken to Rabat to be released. Strange freedom, that we had 
forgotten and that the youngest among us had never known. Always 
accompanied at first, we took hesitating steps to find life, or 
find it again: the bustle and glitter of the streets, the rich 
clamor of the markets, the odors and beautiful light of our 
magnificent country, and the smiles of the people. 
  From confinement to freedom, we were--and still are--in a 
situation with no precise status, with the impression that after 
19 years of detention they left us on the street, with no 
concern for our exhausted bodies, our wounded hearts, our 
devastated lives. 
  We kept silent, we believed in a solution with no new 
trauma, 
no confrontation, and no discredit to our country. We ardently 
wished for it and we undertook everything that was in our power: 
numerous and unceasing steps, officially, discreetly, through 
public officials whom we begged for help or through friends 
acting at our request, and even through their Royal Highnesses 
the princes and princesses who never rejected us or refused to 
listen to us, with simplicity and compassion. We wish to pay 
tribute to them here. 
  However, we are still in a strange, difficult situation: 
"free" but without the right to travel, to discover the world, 
unable to recover whatever remains of our property, without 
compensation also for the irreversible sequels of 19 years of 
captivity. Our only hope now is to finally get the right to 
live, without being unjustly equated any longer with past events 
that were a tragedy for everybody, but a tragedy in which we 
were only bystanders, not the authors. 
  We would like to take part, here or elsewhere according to 
the wishes of each of us, in our country's life and development 
in all fields, without restriction, or prerequisites, or 
prejudice, or segregation, or "special status." For we deeply 
love our country, and if our misfortune could have contributed, 
no matter how little, to its happiness, then we would not have 
the bitter feeling that we have suffered in vain. 
  We would like to be able to come and go in and out of 
Morocco, a right guaranteed to all citizens by our Constitution, 
and to be given the same opportunity to create and undertake as 
this entire dynamic generation who dreams only of making Morocco 
triumph in the concert of modern nations. 
<H5>  The Children's Innocence </H5>
  Today, with very few exceptions, which our officials say are 
about to be settled, all Moroccans have a passport. But an 
application was accepted for only one of us (a girl). That was 
15 months ago, although the normal time it takes to obtain a 
passport is 30 days; and we have had no answer yet. 
  Voltaire once said: "When innocence is persecuted, we are 
all 
concerned." What would the great man have written about 
children's innocence? It is not to go back over the past nor to 
dwell on our fate that we are making this appeal. It is out of 
despair and with humility that we do so, as we are fully aware 
of all the horrors that are tearing at the world and require 
absolute priority. 
  We aspire to one thing only: to put behind us once and for 
all this page of Morocco's history that has traumatized 
everybody. We merely hope that humanism, justice, morality, and 
right will eventually inspire a sincere gesture that might help 
us look forward to a serene future in spite of the implacable 
fate that struck us. 
  The question today is no longer about our survival, but 
about 
our lives. We beg to be given the freedom and means enabling 
each of us to take charge of their lives. Is it wrong to claim 
the right to live, to exist in one's own country or elsewhere? 
Is it wrong to aspire to equal opportunity and equal treatment? 
Is it wrong, after all that we were unjustly subjected to, to 
ask for the means to live with dignity? 
  Because of what curse should we go on living like shadows 
haunted by the past? When will we be given the right to exist as 
individuals rather than as "a case"? When will we be relieved 
from that terrible and unjust fate that overwhelmed us and left 
scars on our souls and our lives, a fate that nothing and nobody 
can justify? 
  We plead here that justice be at last done to us.

Publishes Text of Medical Report Presented to Canadian Court"] 
  [Text] The issue of the assault on Sudan's NIF [National 
Islamic Front] Secretary General Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, who is 
considered by many the power behind the throne in Sudan today, 
at Ottawa Airport nearly 20 months ago resurfaced prominently 
when the Canadian court considering the case acquitted Hashim 
Badr-al-Din, a former international Sudanese karate player and 
the man charged with committing the assault. 
  During the trial, numerous questions were raised about the 
circumstances engulfing the assault and about al-Turabi's 
health. Since the court issued its verdict, numerous pending 
issues have continued, such as: how has the incident affected 
al-Turabi physically and psychologically? Has he recovered from 
it or is he still suffering from some of its effects? Was there 
really a plot behind the assault, as some parties have implied, 
or was the attack an individual act motivated by a "feeling of 
being wronged by what is going on in Sudan," as Hashim 
Badr-al-Din has said? What are the causes of the clamor which 
accompanied al-Turabi's visit to Canada? Why did the Canadian 
consular office in Washington refuse to grant al-Turabi an entry 
visa initially but changed its mind afterward? Was the visit to 
Canada a missionary and call-oriented visit, as al-Turabi said, 
or was it to hold political and trade talks and to discuss 
transactions in the areas of transportation, banking, 
communications, and pharmaceuticals, according to one of three 
Canadian parliamentary deputies who were to meet with al-Turabi 
during his visit? 
  There are other questions: how did the Sudanese opposition 
in 
Canada learn of al-Turabi's itinerary, even though it had not 
been announced officially? What are the circumstances that led 
to the lack of guards to protect al-Turabi before he left 
Ottawa? Was al-Turabi traveling under his real name or under the 
assumed name of "Martin Loony," as some parties have implied? 
  These questions and others were raised during the trial, and 
some of them have remained unanswered, thus adding more mystery 
and excitement to this issue. 
  In a series of articles, AL-MAJALLAH will review some 
aspects 
of the case, of the trial, and of the accompanying controversy. 
It will also publish for the first time a photograph of Dr. 
al-Turabi in the hospital room immediately after the incident. 
This was the first photograph presented to the jury as part of 
the evidence aimed at acquainting the court with the injuries 
sustained by al-Turabi in the incident. Following is the second 
part of this report: 
  Since the assault on Dr. Hasan al-Turabi at Ottawa Airport 
in 
May 1992, numerous questions have been raised regarding the 
health of the Sudanese National Islamic Front secretary general 
and on whether al-Turabi has recovered from the consequences of 
the incident or whether he is still suffering from it physically 
and psychologically despite the lapse of 19 months since the 
assault. Even though al-Turabi has resumed his activities and 
even though he made his first two "official" foreign trips last 
year, visiting Afghanistan, via Pakistan, and the Vatican, 
numerous Sudanese, including some officials and some who are 
close to al-Turabi's family, say that the incident has left its 
imprints on al-Turabi physically and psychologically. These 
people reiterate that al-Turabi "disappears" from time to time 
for a period of one week for treatment from the effects of the 
Ottawa incident. Interpretations vary on the details. Some say 
that the NIF secretary general is taken to a place known only to 
a few, where he stays for a week out of sight to be treated with 
some drugs that have an evident effect on the man and on his 
general capabilities. Others say that he resorts to complete 
rest during this disappearance because he feels extremely tired 
and exhausted after any effort that he exerts. 
  In addition to some officials who work with the current 
regime and who do not wish to reveal their identity, Aldo Ajo 
Deng, deputy speaker of Sudan's Transitional National Assembly 
(parliament) who broke away from the government last month and 
applied for political asylum in England, has also talked about 
this issue. He said that al-Turabi "is hidden" from sight for 
one week a month to rest and regain his energy, which seems to 
have declined greatly since the Ottawa incident. He added that 
numerous people have noticed that al-Turabi tires quickly and 
that his train of thought is affected if he takes part in a long 
conversation or in a public event that requires one to stand and 
concentrate for a long time. 
<H5>  Feeling of Exhaustion </H5>
  In a press interview in the wake of the incident, al-Turabi 
said that he felt exhausted. Moreover, the physician who treated 
him at Civic Hospital in Canada told the court which considered 
Hashim Badr-al-Din's case last year that the patient (al-Turabi) 
had not regained his normal condition when he left the hospital. 
On top of this, the medical report that was submitted to the 
court noted that al-Turabi may need treatment in a "special 
unit" in the United States or Switzerland to regain his fitness. 
It is not known to date whether al-Turabi has received such 
special treatment, keeping in mind that he has not visited the 
United States since the Ottawa incident and that it has not been 
announced or learned that he has visited Switzerland since that 
date, even though rumors were circulated in Sudanese circles 
last year about a "secret visit" al-Turabi made to Switzerland. 
<H5>  Extent of Injuries </H5>
  Al-Turabi (62) suffered a brain concussion, lost his speech 
ability, and experienced extreme weakness on the right side of 
his body as a result of the incident. A Canadian police officer 
is reported to have said in the wake of the incident that the 
blow al-Turabi received from Badr-al-Din did not cause much 
damage and that the main injury resulted when al-Turabi's head 
collided with the ground when he fell. That collision caused a 
nearly two-inch long wound on the right side of the back of his 
head. The wound did not need to be surgically stitched but it 
caused a brain concussion, which began as minor but intensified 
by the third day, according to the report of Dr. Vasco da Silva, 
the physician who treated al-Turabi at Civic Hospital. 
  Before the court considering Badr-al-Din's case, da Silva 
described al-Turabi's injuries as follows: "The injuries can be 
described as three parts: al-Turabi suffered a superficial wound 
to the scalp, and this is the first part. The second part is the 
slight concussion which basically manifests itself in a passing 
or transient loss of consciousness lasting between 15 to 20 
minutes. The more serious injury, which represents the third 
part, was suffered in what can be characterized as a brain 
concussion. 
  "As a result of these injuries, especially the third part, 
al-Turabi experienced unconsciousness and exhaustion. He started 
to breathe haltingly, and he lost all ability to speak and to 
respond to verbal commands. This dictated his return to the 
intensive care room on the third day of his admission to the 
hospital." da Silva characterized the loss of ability to respond 
to verbal commands as the "worrying element" which alerted him 
to the fact that al-Turabi's head injury was not as slight as it 
had seemed to be initially. 
  In his testimony before the court, Dasilva added: "I 
realized 
then that there was something worrying about him (al-Turabi) 
because he wasn't able to talk properly. When one spoke to him, 
he answered on a totally different issue, meaning that his 
disturbed ability to speak made me conclude that there was a 
positional fault in the brain. This was confirmed by our [later] 
diagnosis, which showed what I have characterized as a brain 
concussion." 
<H5>  Court Dialogue </H5>
  The following dialogue then took place between Dr. da Silva 
and the attorney defending Badr-al-Din (the defendant) in court: 
  [Attorney] When you say that he (al-Turabi) was giving 
illogical answers, do you mean that he was unable to talk? 
  [Da Silva] He talked. Yes, he talked on the first and second 
day after his admission to the hospital. But if one asked him: 
How are you? He would respond: in Toronto, thank you. 
  [Attorney] But there was no problem in his ability to speak? 
  [Da Silva] This is what one can call impossible or disturbed 
speech. What I mean is this sort of illogical responses. 
  [Attorney] Did you decide that there was a concussion after 
the sectional scanning of the brain, or did you make your 
decision before the scan was conducted. 
  [Da Silva] I felt that there was something wrong with the 
brain before the sectional scan was made. The result of the scan 
confirmed my doubts. 
  Questions and answers then revolved around permission given 
by Dr. da Silva to a physician named 'Abd-al-Amin, who arrived 
from Chicago on 27 May 1992 (two days after the incident), to 
examine Dr. al-Turabi at his family's request. The attorney 
wondered if it was normal to permit Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin to examine 
al-Turabi even though he had come from abroad, meaning that he 
did not belong to the staff working at Civic Hospital. In 
response, Dr. da Silva said that this was not unusual and noted 
that Dr. al-Amin suggested two kinds of drugs to treat al-Turabi. 
  According to the medical report, Dr. al-Turabi had an 
allergic reaction and developed a skin rash because of one of 
the two drugs. Dr. al-Turabi also experienced weakness on the 
right side of his body and a total loss of his speech ability. 
After 19 days in the hospital, there was improvement in the 
condition of Dr. al-Turabi, who regained his ability to speak 
and started to walk a little around his room. He also continued 
to take his medication. 
<H5>  Condition Engulfed in Ambiguity </H5>
  Al-Turabi's health condition was encircled by walls of 
"official" silence through his stay at the hospital. Civic 
Hospital officials were asked not to make any statements about 
his health. Reporters' questions were referred to the Sudanese 
Embassy in Ottawa, which either refused to answer the questions 
or offered vague answers. 
  Ambiguity continued to engulf al-Turabi's condition even 
after his return to Khartoum on 21 June 1992. The authorities 
concerned prevented people from visiting him, and only a few 
relatives and close associates saw him. Writing about 
al-Turabi's return, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI, the government paper, 
said, "al-Turabi's kinsmen, and those who love him and who are 
close to him and who were around him or in contact with the 
Canadian hospital where he was being treated, received saddening 
medical reports at times and encouraging reports at other times. 
But the final days of his weeks of recuperation witnessed 
improvement that doctors could not believe and that surprised 
observers, considering that he began to regain his health and to 
act as if nothing had happened." 
  SUNA, the Sudanese News Agency, also circulated a report on 
al-Turabi's return to Khartoum from Ottawa in which it said that 
he was "in good health." But all other reports and sources said 
that, even though al-Turabi felt great improvement in his 
health, he continued to suffer from the effects of the incident 
for a long time. The first time the Sudanese people saw 
al-Turabi after his incident was in a "silent film" shown by 
Sudanese television on a visit which Lieutenant-General 'Umar 
al-Bashir, the Revolutionary Command Council chairman, paid to 
al-Turabi's home to reassure himself about al-Turabi's health 
nearly one week after he had returned to Khartoum. In the film, 
the NIF secretary general looked pale and exhausted and his 
voice could not be heard during his conversation with 
Lieutenant-General al-Bashir. 
  Some people who were permitted to visit al-Turabi weeks 
after 
his return have reported that he could not stand for a long 
time, even though he leaned on a walking stick, and that he also 
had difficulty moving his right arm and foot because of a slight 
paralysis resulting form the incident. He seemed to have 
difficulty speaking. It was also noticed that he talked about 
nothing other than the incident. Some people interpreted this as 
part of the psychological effect of the assault and injury. 
  On 31 July 1992, a ceremony was held in the Green Square in 
Khartoum on the occasion of al-Turabi's return and "recovery." 
Al-Turabi delivered an address in which he said, according to 
SUNA, "God fated me to survive and He prolonged my life after 
they paralyzed a part of my body and stopped my tongue from 
speaking. But God has restored my speech to me and has healed my 
paralyzed side." Al-Turabi added, "Muslims are the source of the 
invocation for my recovery." He also alluded to a plot to 
assassinate him. 
  Despite the lapse of 18 months since that ceremony, there 
are 
still those who say that al-Turabi, even though he has largely 
recovered his health and his abilities, continues to suffer from 
some effects of that incident and that he still needs medication 
and periods of treatment and rest. 
<H5>  Questions About His Future </H5>
  The assault on al-Turabi created great confusion within the 
NIF ranks and it almost touched off an open conflict within the 
NIF leadership ranks between those aspiring to succeed al-Turabi 
and those advocating a change in the leadership system so as to 
fill the void that developed at the time or that could develop 
in the future if the incident were to leave lasting effects on 
the secretary general's health. According to reports leaked at 
the time, a number of the NIF leaders raised the issue of 
forming a collective leadership to fill the void during 
al-Turabi's presence in the hospital for treatment and to 
replace him in case he disappears or becomes unable to work. It 
was reported that the names proposed to form that leadership 
were those of NIF Deputy Secretary General 'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad 
Taha, Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, Ibrahim al-Sinusi, Yasin 'Umar 
al-Imam, and 'Uthman Khalid Mudawi. But the proposal was 
rejected by 'Ali 'Uthman, who insisted that the adoption of such 
a step could produce adverse results and reflect the regime as a 
regime experiencing void or weakness because of al-Turabi's 
absence. 
  'Ali 'Uthman's argument did not convince the NIF's "old 
generation" who saw that 'Uthman was trying to gain sole control 
of the decisionmaking and to succeed al-Turabi "even while he is 
still alive." The feelings of annoyance among the ranks of the 
"old generation" began to appear in what this generation's men 
said in their private sessions. Some of them talked about 
endeavors by 'Ali 'Uthman to marginalize others and about 
'Uthman's efforts to gain control of affairs and to impose his 
tendencies on the NIF and on the regime. 
  It is to be noted that the majority of the Sudanese speak of 
'Ali 'Uthman as the planning head behind the 30 June 1989 coup 
and as the real director of numerous domestic affairs, 
especially since al-Turabi is inclined to devote a large part of 
his time to working and planning with the other movements 
connected with the NIF in the region. It has been noticed that 
since the assault on al-Turabi, 'Ali 'Uthman has begun to figure 
more prominently in the political arena, has begun to assume 
ministerial positions, and has begun to expand his powers and to 
enlarge the sphere of his influence by giving positions to the 
Front's "young generation" and by marginalizing the "old 
generation" that can dispute his leadership of the NIF action. 
  Even though al-Turabi has begun to exercise his leadership 
tasks since his return and, to a large degree, his recovery, 
some sort of division of roles has surfaced between him and 'Ali 
'Uthman, with al-Turabi devoting most of his attention and time 
to the foreign movement and contacts and to coordination with 
other fundamentalist movements through the facade of the Islamic 
Arab Popular Conference. Meanwhile, 'Ali 'Uthman takes charge of 
domestic executive action, with the role of grand "master" and 
guide maintained by al-Turabi in the domestic arena as well. 
  Many in the NIF and outside it realize that it will be 
difficult for 'Uthman to fill the void created in case al-Turabi 
disappears. This is because 'Uthman lacks al-Turabi's long 
experience and his extensive network of foreign relations. 
'Uthman is not even known to many beyond Sudan's border, and 
some view him as more of a political figure than a religious 
leader. 
  This is why NIF cohesion and unity seem to be tied to 
al-Turabi and to the extent of his ability to overcome the 
effects of the Ottawa incident, especially in light of the 
growing crises and pressures confronting the Sudanese regime 
internally and externally.

  [Text] Dr. Hasan al-Turabi was assaulted at Ottawa Airport 
on the evening of 25 May 1992. According to witnesses, al-Turabi 
received one or two blows to the head by a karate expert. 
Consequently, he fell down and his head collided with the 
ground, causing him to lose consciousness for 15-20 minutes. 
  Al-Turabi arrived at the Civic Hospital's emergency section 
at 1935. He was breathing normally, and his pulse and blood 
pressure were stable and within normal range. 
  There was blood in the nostrils, the upper lip was swollen, 
and there was a wound on the right rear side of the head. But no 
operation was needed to stitch the wound. 
  His eyes opened automatically, and he responded to verbal 
directions most of the time. But his verbal responses were not 
logical. Despite this, he showed no sign of weakness at the time. 
  A sectional brain scan showed a concussion in the front left 
side and temple. But the examination showed no blockage at the 
base of the skull, excluding a slight swelling in the left 
section of the skull. 
  Treatment with dexamethasone was initiated and Dr. al-Turabi 
spent the night of his hospital admission in the intensive care 
unit. On the following day (26 May), he was transferred to the 
neurosurgery ward. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin visited Dr. al-Turabi on 27 
May at the request of al-Turabi's family. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin 
suggested that al-Turabi be treated with minitol and phenytoin. 
  Repeated brain scans showed signs of a broader concussion 
than shown initially by the preliminary tests. It also became 
evident that there was great accumulation of fluids. It further 
became manifestly clear that the patient had lost the ability to 
speak. 
  On 28 May, Dr. al-Turabi seemed to be extremely exhausted 
and 
sleepy and totally unable to speak. Moreover, he was breathing 
haltingly. (A test of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood 
showed a reading of 47 TUR (measuring unit). He was readmitted 
to the intensive care unit and hooked to intravenous tubes and a 
breathing machine. His condition remained stable until the tube 
leading to the lungs through the trachea was removed. This was 
followed by a weakness of 4/5 degrees on the right side and 
total loss of speech. 
  On 2 June, al-Turabi was taken out of the intensive care 
unit. On 4 June, a rash appeared on his skin, and it was 
attributed to an allergic reaction to the drug dilantin. 
Consequently, it was decided to treat him with 250 milligrams of 
valboric acid three times daily. His treatment with minitol was 
suspended, the dosage of dexamethasone was reduced, and feeding 
by tube was resumed. 
  After this, al-Turabi was able to take a few steps in his 
room and could urinate without help from anybody. He also 
regained his ability to understand verbal directions, along with 
the ability to read and write. This was on 13 June. He also 
became able to feed himself. 
  The treatment with valboric acid may continue for six 
months. 
It is likely that a degree of the inability to comprehend and a 
large degree of the inability to speak will persist in a manner 
that cannot be determined by the preliminary tests. If his 
family agrees, Dr. al-Turabi can be helped to regain his fitness 
in a special unit, either in the United States or in Europe. 
This can be done on his way back to his country or shortly after 
he arrives in Sudan. I personally prefer that he be treated at a 
European center.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abderrahmane Tlili, secretary-general of the </F>
Unionist Democratic Union, by Fatiha Ferchouche; place and date 
not given: "`The Problem of the Arab World Has Been and Remains 
Democracy'"; first paragraph is REALITES introduction] 
  [Text] The secretary-general of the UDU [Unionist 
Democratic Union] here makes a general survey. He talks about 
pan-Arabism, the SAP [Structural Adjustment Program], and the 
upcoming elections in this interview. 
  [Ferchouche] What distinguishes the UDU from other parties 
and the RCD [Constitutional and Democratic Rally]? 
  [Tlili] We are the only Tunisian party to have incorporated 
the Arab dimension into its political program. All the others, 
on the other hand, and I am not being polemical here at all, 
have added that element to their--demagogic--rhetoric purely as 
a matter of opportunism since the crisis in the Gulf. 
  [Ferchouche] Isn't that paradoxical--didn't the Gulf crisis 
reveal the failure of pan-Arabism or at least of a certain form 
of pan-Arabism? 
  [Tlili] For our part, we feel that nationalism is a basic 
fact among peoples. This is true even in the most authoritarian 
regimes like the former USSR, where, despite the support of 
Marxist ideology, the transfers of populations, and the 
"integration" policies, it was impossible to wipe out 
nationalism. What has happened in the Arab world is the failure 
of Arab nationalists, not of Arab nationalism. It is the same 
failure as that experienced by all those who have not 
incorporated the democratic dimension into their platforms and 
actions--all those who have used the just aspirations of the 
people as the basis of their dictatorships. The problem of the 
Arab world has been and remains democracy. For that matter, the 
simple reason why all attempts at union have always failed is, 
basically, the absence of democracy, on which the fate of any 
political plan depends nowadays. 
  [Ferchouche] What is your economic program? 
  [Tlili] It is premature to talk about an economic program 
when the election campaign has not yet officially begun. We will 
have plenty of time to explain our entire election platform to 
you. But here are the main outlines: we will place special 
emphasis on three problems: employment and vocational training, 
regional development, and exports. It is true that those 
problems are current topics and that they are being dealt with 
by the authorities, but the UDU is trying to find better 
solutions to them. 
  Employment, which is currently the scourge of the West, 
could 
become a real problem in coming years if care is not taken. 
However, and this is not among its least advantages, the 
Tunisian economy still has several pools of jobs, although some 
sectors may be called upon sooner or later to undergo severe 
restructuring. Besides the need to carry out public works 
projects that are essential for modernizing our infrastructures, 
it would be sufficient, for example, to implement a new urban 
policy, if only by applying the legal arsenal available to the 
municipal governments, to create thousands of jobs. 
  Vocational training is such an overworked subject that it is 
tending to become a pet theme. Without going into detail, I will 
say that we will propose an upgrading of training in the basic 
and service occupations, a coordination of training with the 
needs of the economy, and, above all, the supplying of training 
that will meet the requirements of relocation, particularly as 
regards certain jobs with a future such as data processing, 
telematics, and so on. Just consider that Swissair subcontracts 
its accounting to Bombay, India, whereas we are continuing to be 
subcontractors in areas where we will soon be supplanted by the 
Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam! 
  As far as regional development is concerned, we will propose 
the establishment of economic zones and development centers that 
will have their own funds, which will be determined in 
proportion to their rates of growth. 
  [Ferchouche] Are you talking about decentralization? 
  [Tlili] It is no longer a question of decentralization, but 
rather of regionalization. Those regions will also have certain 
prerogatives clearly defined by law to enable them to take full 
or partial responsibility for certain sectors of economic, 
social, and cultural life that have traditionally been managed 
by the central government (schools, hospitals, and so on). This 
should result in genuine interregional competition. 
  As regards exports--another subject that everybody talks 
about but very few understand--we feel that our export products 
will not be able to survive international competition, 
especially after 1995, which is when the GATT agreements will 
take effect, unless they are competitive in terms of quality, 
enter the distribution channels, and carry guarantees of quality 
and origin. 
  All of this will require a great deal of financial 
investment. Are domestic savings sufficient to carry out all 
those programs? We do not think so. Hence the need for foreign 
investment, and we estimate that at least $1.5 billion per year 
will be needed for 10 years or so. And it seems obvious to us 
that Tunisia is not benefiting sufficiently from the 
opportunities for financial investment from abroad or from the 
relocation of industry from North to South: China attracted more 
than $130 billion in foreign investment in 1993. 
  [Ferchouche] The great majority of the parties have 
criticized the SAP. What is your position on that subject? 
  [Tlili] The SAP is a necessity, and regardless of our 
judgment and opinion of that program, it has obviously made 
steady progress over the past several years. Its first phase is 
drawing to a close. It has yielded favorable results from the 
standpoint of overall balances and growth. Those successes are 
due basically to the fact that Tunisia, through the personal 
impetus given by President Ben Ali, has managed to safeguard its 
social gains, something that is not the case in other countries, 
where we have seen the rise of discontent and even popular 
revolts following implementation of the SAP. 
  For our part, we ourselves were saying from the start that 
those social gains--the quality of social services and public 
service--should not be victims of the SAP, because we feel that 
growth in the GNP [gross national product] is worth the trouble 
only if it does not make the rich richer and the poor 
poorer--that is, if it guarantees a maximum of general 
satisfaction. 
  [Ferchouche] How do you intend to approach the elections? 
  [Tlili] Under our internal rules, it is the National Council 
that decides election policy and appoints candidates. To begin 
with, work has been done at the regional federation level to 
draw up consensual slates of candidates. Now it will be up the 
National Council to ratify those rank-and-file decisions or 
arbitrate disagreements. 
  [Ferchouche] Are alliances planned in connection with the 
elections? 
  [Tlili] Alliances are no longer the order of the day. 
Putting 
together a coalition based on a common platform is out of date, 
and the timetable does not allow for it. That being said, we 
have been consistently calling for the formation of a democratic 
front since 6 April 1989, but we have also been insisting that 
such a front should be based on a common platform, not on a 
temporary coalition, because right from the start, we were 
afraid of combinations with a subjectively ephemeral character. 
On the other hand, I think there is still time for technical 
agreements among the parties aimed at ensuring that the 
elections go smoothly. At any rate, all we can say at this stage 
is that policies of one-upmanship must be avoided, because any 
one-upmanship leads to the appearance, if only temporarily, of 
extremes, meaning, in our case, a victory by all those who do 
not want Tunisia to get in step with the multiparty system and 
democracy. 
  [Ferchouche] In your opinion, what are the necessary 
conditions for the success of the election campaign? 
  [Tlili] Political action cannot be regulated solely by laws. 
The law is often ahead of reality, and mentalities must also 
change. That change is slowly but surely taking place in our 
country. Because of that, and speaking generally, we want the 
campaign on radio and television in particular to take place in 
conditions that will allow the various parties to express 
themselves and clearly set forth their platforms, thereby 
enabling the citizens to vote for the party they choose on the 
basis of its platform rather than on the basis of clever 
slogans. Because when all is said and done, the big challenge in 
the elections lies not so much in their competitive nature and 
the results they lead to as it does in the awareness that the 
voter gains through his action as a citizen capable of 
influencing, not to say directing, his country's policy on the 
basis of his basic choices. 
  [Ferchouche] How do you see the postelection period? 
  [Tlili] It is difficult to foresee the postelection period, 
but what one can say today is that on 21 March, all the parties 
in the race will have to assess the operation. Will we witness a 
movement to found new parties or realign some old ones? Perhaps. 
For our part, we have already scheduled a National Council 
meeting for the period after the election. There we will have to 
genuinely assess our election results and, on that basis, decide 
what steps to take. One such step might even be the calling of a 
special congress this fall.

<F P=106> [Article by Moncef Mahroug: "Secrets of the Congress"; first </F>
paragraph is REALITES introduction 
  [Text] The LTDH [Tunisian Human Rights League] 
Congress--which ended better than it began--was a bitter battle 
both on the rostrum and behind the scenes. 
  "I am deeply moved by what we have just experienced at the 
opening of the congress. The sincere elite, which took the 
initiative 16 years ago in establishing the first human rights 
movement not only in Tunisia but also in the Arab world, in 
Africa, and beyond--that elite would never have thought that one 
day we would be experiencing moments like those we have just 
witnessed. It was my duty to say this to you because that is 
what I deeply feel." That was how Hassib Ben Ammar, president of 
the Arab Institute of Human Rights and one of the LTDH founding 
fathers, addressed members and congressional delegates from the 
rostrum of the fourth LTDH Congress. In a trembling voice, he 
expressed and showed his emotion and pain at the distressing 
spectacle the LTDH made of itself before its members and 
everyone else during the first few minutes of a congress that 
was supposed to have marked the organization's rebirth. 
  Flashback: In an electric atmosphere and in the presence of 
24 other members of the LTDH Managing Committee--their faces as 
tense and somber as his own--Moncef Marzouki, the organization's 
president, stepped before a microphone and, surprisingly, began 
singing the national anthem. The audience hesitated a moment 
before singing along with the LTDH president--whose action 
seemed intended as a response to those who, in his own words, 
say that he is "a tool of foreign interests"--but join in it 
did. Then Marzouki said: "With head held high, I open this 
congress, the fourth congress of the Tunisian Human Rights 
League." He immediately launched into a severe indictment of the 
government's policy on individual and collective freedoms and 
human rights. In passing, he responded to the criticisms leveled 
at him by certain people and their accusations concerning 
him--including the charge, which he himself mentioned, that he 
had not sought consensus. 
  The speech by the LTDH president was not to the liking of a 
great many people, and among his colleagues on the Managing 
Committee, Vice President Khemais Chammari was the first to show 
his displeasure and express it loudly. As soon as it became 
evident to him that the LTDH president--who had long been 
complaining to anyone who would listen that he was being 
"deprived of the right to speak"--was not going to simply 
welcome the key personalities invited by the LTDH to the opening 
session of its fourth congress, Khemais Chammari stood up and 
went to sit in the second row on the rostrum. It was a way of 
expressing his reservations about the speech being delivered by 
the LDTH president, and Hichem Gribaa soon followed suit by 
leaving the rostrum altogether. 
  "So many hardships endured by this league...." When he 
realized that the LTDH president was going to take his sweet 
time, Khemais Chammari let his anger burst into the open and 
began protesting Moncef Marzouki's attitude. That is what he and 
other members of the Managing Committee had threatened to do if 
Marzouki did not prepare his speech--supposedly to be delivered 
in the name of the Managing Committee--and submit it to the 
other committee members for their approval. Their vain attempts 
to get him to do so had been evaded by Marzouki on various 
grounds during the three weeks preceding the congress. 
  In Amilcar on Day "J-1," the members of the Managing 
Committee returned to the attack. This time Moncef Marzouki 
flatly refused to comply, then changed his mind and promised to 
prepare a text and submit it on Saturday just before the 
congress opened. But the congress was scheduled to open at 1000, 
and the LDTH president did not arrive in Amilcar until 0940. 
That made it impossible for the Managing Committee to meet and 
pin down the text of the opening speech. It was on the steps of 
the hall where the congress was to meet that the president of 
the LTDH let a member of the Managing Committee in on the 
contents of the speech he prepared. But that member realized 
afterward that the league's president had, in fact, read only 
the first two or three pages of the speech to him, and there was 
almost nothing offensive in those pages. 
  The speech of the LDTH president antagonized not only his 
colleagues on the Managing Committee but also some of the 
guests, especially Yadh El Ouedreni, minister-adviser to the 
chief of state for human rights; Minister of National Education 
Mohamed Charfi; and Hatem Ben Othman, deputy secretary general 
of the Constitutional Democratic Rally, all three of whom left 
the congress auditorium as a sign of protest against the speech 
by the LDTH president. 
  At that point, chaos broke out. An infuriated Khemais 
Chammari was less and less able to control his anger. For his 
part, Moncef Marzouki began translating his own speech from 
Arabic into French--even though three interpreters hired by the 
LTDH were in the auditorium. Then, imperceptibly, the LDTH 
president began speaking more in French and giving only a 
condensed translation in Arabic, as though the ambassadors and 
the representatives of international organizations became, as 
Hassib Ben Ammar put it, his main audience and the congress 
delegates merely a secondary group of listeners. 
  Following a brief interruption, Moncef Marzouki resumed the 
reading of his speech after Taoufik Bouderbala, LDTH 
secretary-general, stepped in to ask the audience to stop 
interrupting the speaker. In a voice hoarse with emotion, the 
LDTH president offered "the apologies of the league, because I 
was a man prevented from speaking for months." That brought 
another interruption by Khemais Chammari: "My brothers and 
sisters, the problem is simple: up until this morning we had not 
read the text. Moncef refused. This has been going on for five 
years. Unfortunately, he rejects collective action." 
  There was a second attempt by the LTDH secretary-general to 
calm a number of delegates standing up for Moncef Marzouki: "No, 
no, please; our work is not going to progress normally and be 
profitable if this keeps up. Please let him finish. This is not 
the way the league is in the habit of opening its congresses. We 
have only one objective, and that is to preserve the league, 
preserve its unity and independence, and make the congress a 
success." 
  The LTDH president resumed his speech, but again he was 
interrupted by several members of the Managing Committee, who 
reminded Marzouki that there was no need for him to translate 
his own speech. Suddenly the LDTH president changed his tone and 
attitude. He dropped a bombshell: "In order to help the league, 
I am informing you officially and definitely that I have decided 
to withdraw my candidacy for the Managing Committee and the 
presidency of the league, and the reason is what you have just 
witnessed in this auditorium. I am withdrawing from this 
congress, and I call on you to continue the struggle." Before 
carrying out his decision, the outgoing president of the league 
made a gesture intended to give the thumbs up to his friends and 
allies, calling on the congress to support "the militant, 
progressive, and independence-minded league" and to elect "a 
leadership made up of the most courageous men and women in order 
to face up to this difficult situation." 
  Some of the delegates halfheartedly opposed Moncef 
Marzouki's 
decision, but a Managing Committee member shouted to him that: 
"there is not going to be a plebiscite." While refusing to speak 
himself, Taoufik Bouderbala offered the opportunity to those 
members of the Managing Committee who wanted to say something. 
Frej Fennich accepted that responsibility and the risk it 
involved. He spoke mainly in response to Moncef Marzouki. 
  Unlike the outgoing president of the LTDH, who spoke in the 
first person singular, Frej Fennich spoke on behalf of all the 
members of the Managing Committee. So while Moncef Marzouki 
claimed to have his "head held high," Frej Fennich claimed that 
"with heads held high and on behalf of the LTDH Managing 
Committee, we collectively welcome the congress delegates and 
guests." Frej Fennich directed another shaft at Moncef Marzouki 
when he proclaimed that "the league is the league of all 
Tunisians," that "we thought we had left the era of personal 
power behind," and that "the congress delegates are sovereign." 
  Helped by Hassib Ben Ammar, the members of the Managing 
Committee were able to restore calm in the auditorium. After 
first announcing, it is true, an effort to persuade Moncef 
Marzouki to come back into the auditorium. The LTDH president 
eventually agreed. But once back on the rostrum, he stated 
firmly: "I am not withdrawing my decision to withdraw my 
candidacy. And I do not take back a single thing I have said." 
  At the end of the opening session, Moncef Marzouki left the 
congress auditorium and the hotel. And he did not set foot in it 
again. His absence when deliberations resumed intrigued his 
friends. Worried by his prolonged absence, they briefly 
considered informing the delegates of "Moncef Marzouki's 
disappearance." Most members of the Managing Committee opposed 
the idea. Some of them, including Hassib Ben Ammar, contacted 
several members of the government by telephone. The latter 
informed them that the authorities concerned did not know where 
Moncef Marzouki was. His whereabouts were learned early that 
evening: he had simply gone back to his home in Sousse.

<F P=106> [Article by Khemais Chammari: "After the Crisis, Hope"] </F>
  [Text] The fourth LTDH Congress, the keynote of which was 
the autonomy and freedom of associations, was not the failure 
that some people were expecting. Quite the contrary. 
  Let us overlook the dismaying and tragicomic episode at the 
opening session, the only reason for which was the outgoing 
president's deliberate refusal to accept the democratic rule 
that called for submitting his opening speech--designed to be a 
speech of defiance and pique--to the Managing Committee for its 
review. 
  Let us also overlook, despite its seriousness, the violence 
done to a journalist-photographer and the terrorism in the form 
of insults and threats that a tiny minority of congress 
delegates belonging to the extreme left tried in vain to impose 
on the congress, which remained a congress of free expression 
and energy. 
  Instead, let us remember the remarkable calmness of the 
officers of the congress (Taieb Baccouche and the seven other 
officers), the efficient organization thanks to the logistic 
support provided by the Arab Institute of Human Rights, the 
productive discussions in committee and in the plenary sessions, 
the pluralistic debate, and, last, that democratic space that is 
unique in our country and that we absolutely must preserve. 
  Yes, it is with heads held high that the old members are 
leaving the league today. With their heads held high not to make 
verbal attacks on personalities they themselves invited or to 
slander the men and women who have taken over the leadership of 
the league. But I am convinced that the latter will be able to 
scathingly refute those who, in an insult to the future, are 
announcing "the disappearance of this last democratic space" 
because, in their eyes, democratic rules can only be a one-way 
street. 
  Following the crisis, there is again hope that the league 
will return to the idea that gave it its prestige and specific 
character as a major and responsible opposition force that 
protests without going to excess and is concerned to develop its 
capacity for dialogue and negotiation and its ability to make 
proposals. 
  At the head of the league today, we have passed the reins to 
a new and younger team whose president is not likely to drift 
into the narcissistic and despotic ways that we have been 
subjected to for four years. The essential thing is to preserve 
the league's independence and, in the internal debates by the 
Managing Committee, to return to that tradition of mutual 
respect, tolerance, dialogue, and social interaction, which 
unfortunately wound up disappearing under the combined effect of 
bitter political conflicts, the contagion of unbearable 
paranoia, and a policy of "sloganization" that sterilized most 
of the essential debate. 
  Besides the exemplary democratic way in which the final 
balloting took place, one reason for hoping that we have now 
left the crisis definitely behind us is the content of the 
resolutions adopted with respect to internal regulations and the 
law on associations. The fight for human rights and the rights 
of citizens and peoples is an ethical and political fight for 
freedoms, for equality, against discrimination, for physical 
integrity and against torture, for the universality of standards 
and procedures for protection of the human person, and for the 
indivisible nature of those rights, which are not only civil and 
political but also economic, social, and cultural. 
  The extreme left, which has fought and continues to fight 
for 
freedom of association and pluralist democracy, has not yet 
fully realized that to finish this fight, it is necessary to 
leave behind sectarian reflexes and archaic ideas concerning the 
rights of peoples as opposed to human rights and to abandon a 
populist-nationalist particularism that sets itself against 
universality in a simplistic and suspicious manner. 
  Above all, both in the league and in the university, that 
left is paying the price for an erroneous strategy aimed at the 
systematic and partisan besieging of the democratic space for 
associations. 
  Fighting for the rights of the human person means deeply 
rooting our convictions in a constant reference to the standards 
of the state of law and to international statements and legal 
instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
  Attentive to the appeals and the distress of the outcasts, 
those without a voice, the oppressed, and the victims of 
repression, we must voice their appeals to the public 
authorities while also performing a function of indispensable 
training and education for promoting a true human rights 
mentality. Last, the fight for human rights presupposes an 
availability to others, the qualities of a listener, and a 
conception of democratic citizenship that cannot possibly be a 
monopoly controlled by the leading lights of a certain kind of 
thundering "human rights-ism" with perverse effects. 
  Because quite obviously, such a monopoly constitutes a poor 
substitute for partisan political action or, what is even more 
tragic, clinical therapies that it is serious and useless to 
evade any longer. 
  Those are the errors that the league's new leadership will 
have to go to work on. We wish it good luck so that the 
independent and democratic Tunisian league will have a long life.

<F P=106> [Article by Mehdi Yakdhan: "Convincing Figures!"] </F>
  [Text] Among the commonplaces frequently heard in economic 
and political controversies, one that is particularly hardy 
consists of challenging figures advanced by the other side by 
saying that "you can make figures say whatever you want." 
  The argument is somewhat facile, but it is effective, 
because 
the manipulation of statistics has often ended by arousing 
skepticism and distrust. To deal with that problem, then, the 
figures one advances must be indisputable, and their proposed 
interpretation must be as transparent as possible. That is the 
object of this commentary regarding the members of the LTDH 
[Tunisian Human Rights League], the delegates to its fourth 
congress, and the final balloting on 6 February 1994. 
<H5>  RCD Raid! </H5>
  In a statement reported by the daily LIBERATION on 8 
February 
1994, the outgoing president of the LTDH once again raised the 
argument that the LTDH was being "raided" by the Destourians 
(that is, the government party RCD [Constitutional Democratic 
Rally]). He said that the league "could no longer screen 
membership applications," with the result that "a maximum number 
of RCD members have joined our ranks." 
  In response to that completely tendentious argument, the 
following objections can be raised: 
  1. The makeup of the ad hoc committee appointed by the 
Managing Committee to "screen" the some 2,250 renewal 
applications and the some 3,950 new membership applications was 
decided on by the Managing Committee in November 1993 on the 
advice of the league president. 
  2. The exhausting work done by that committee, headed by 
Khedija Cherif, proceeded calmly, and after recommending 
adjustments on the order of 6 percent, the Managing Committee 
formally and unanimously ratified the ad hoc committee's 
conclusions, which did not completely satisfy any of the 
Managing Committee's members but did, quite obviously, 
constitute the basis of consensus most acceptable to everyone. 
  3. At no time did the 41 branch congresses, the National 
Council (meeting on 30 January 1994), or the congress completely 
reject the process resulting in agreement to issue 4,327 
membership cards (including renewals and new members), although 
individual reservations were expressed here and there. 
  Of the 4,327 cards in the final count (the number approved 
out of a total of just over 6,000 applications), 2,293, or 53 
percent, were renewals and 47 percent were new members. That is 
a reasonable ratio for an association that issued only 300 cards 
(to six branches) in 1990 and no cards in 1991, 1992, and 1993. 
  The estimate advanced by the most cautious members of the 
Managing Committee places the number of new membership 
applications from RCD members at around 25 percent. They also 
say--and it is hard to contradict them--that of the 1,650 new 
membership applications not accepted by the ad hoc committee and 
the Managing Committee, nearly 90 percent were from members of 
the government party, and that nearly 900 applications were 
mailed to the Managing Committee or turned in at the office of 
the secretary general of the LTDH. Thus, if one goes by the most 
alarmist statements by the most refractory members of the 
outgoing Managing Committee, the raid or "Destourian takeover 
bid" consisted of fewer than 700 new membership applications 
spread over 41 branches! 
<H5>  Branch Congress Marathon </H5>
  Those 41 branch election congresses, where the thorough 
debates were often remarkable, attracted over 3,200 of the 4,327 
certified members. 
  In 35 branches, the work was done in transparence and 
without 
excessive tension. In the six branches where problems arose, the 
members of the Managing Committee who were in charge of 
presiding over the meetings managed to reach agreement on 
initiatives and measures making it possible to remove the 
obstacles. Those initiatives and measures were ratified 
unanimously by the Managing Committee. 
  The result was the election of 328 delegates to the 
congress. 
That number consisted of 287 branch committee members and 41 
additional delegates (one from each branch), the branch 
"ceilings" being set at 100 members for 35 branches, 150 for 
five branches, and nearly 250 in the case of Jendouba, which was 
the object of a special consensus. Of the 328 delegates, 177 (54 
percent) had no partisan political affiliation, while the 46 
percent regarded as "organized" belonged to legal or 
unrecognized political parties or to trends of opinion, examples 
being the network of supporters of the Progressive Islamist 
magazine 15-21 and the network of MDS [Movement of Socialist 
Democrats] dissidents united around Mustapha Ben Jaafar. 
  So then, the RCD accounted for one-seventh of the delegates, 
the POCT [Communist Workers Party] one-eighth, and the MDS 
one-eighth, while other "tendencies" accounted for a little over 
two-fifths of the delegates having a clear connection with some 
political group. In that connection, we note that the record in 
"effectiveness" was achieved by the network of MDS dissidents 
through often contradictory alliances. The MDS wound up with as 
many delegates as the Islamists of 15-21 and the RSP [Socialist 
Progressive Party] combined! 
  Of the 328 delegates, 307 had been members since 1989 and 
were already members back at the third congress, while 21 joined 
after that time. 
  The above figures relativize in a singular manner the claim 
that there has been a "mass entry movement" and a "sudden break 
with the traditional equilibriums"! But that is not all, because 
in fact, the continuity has been remarkable. 
<H5>  Continuity of National Council </H5>
  On 30 January 1994, during the new National Council's first 
session, it became clear that the idea of a sudden break with 
the league's traditional equilibriums was an exaggeration, to 
say the least: 
  1. Eighteen outgoing branch presidents were reelected and 
attended that session. 
  2. Twelve new branch presidents were elected with the 
support 
of the outgoing presidents (as the result of a general consensus 
within the branch or as part of a joint election slate). 
  3. Four branches had been "frozen" since 1989, and fifth had 
been in that situation since 1985. In the case of those five 
branches (Sidi Bouzid, Rades, Medenine, Tebourba, and 
Tataouine), which now have new officers, comparisons between the 
situation before the crisis and the new situation are not 
convincing. 
  4. Two branches (Mahdia and Beja) had not yet assigned 
duties 
within their newly elected committees. 
  5. So only four branches made a clear change in the 
political 
affiliations of their presidents! 
<H5>  Two Slates Presented to Congress Delegates </H5>
  On the question of political coloring, the following should 
be noted: 
  1. The winning slate, called the League for Autonomy 
Consensus Slate, included two MSD members, two RCD members (as 
has been true of all managing committees since the first 
congress in February 1982!), two Progressive Islamists, one MDS 
dissident, one PUP [Popular Unity Party] member, one member of 
the Ettajdid Movement (formerly the Communist Party), and one 
extreme leftist. 
  That makes 10 "organized" members (note that this group, 
which until now has not included Progressive Islamists, 
previously accounted for 12 members of the Managing Committee) 
and 15 independents, including three on the extreme Left and 
five union officials (elected or seconded from their unions, 
another new feature). 
  2. For its part, the "Slate for League Autonomy" consisted 
of 
five MDS dissidents, seven POCT members, five extreme leftists 
close to the POCT, two RSP members, and six independents, 
including one former member of the Managing Bureau of the UGTT 
[Tunisian General Federation of Labor]. 
  That is an edifying comparison! 
  On the question of responsibilities within the league's 
structures, the following should be noted: 
  1. The League for Autonomy Consensus Slate included six past 
or present branch presidents, 11 members of branch committees, 
six members of the outgoing Managing Committee, and two 
candidates from outside the league's leadership structures, one 
of those candidates being a former president of the Association 
of Tunisian Journalists. 
  2. For its part, the Slate for League Autonomy included 10 
past or present branch presidents, eight members of branch 
committees, three members of the outgoing Managing Committee, 
and four candidates not belonging to any of the league's 
leadership structures. 
  One form of disparagement currently being engaged in by 
supporters of the league's outgoing president consists of 
belittling the winning slate by saying that: 
  1. It does not include any "prestigious figures"--a relative 
notion but one which, if accepted, applies just as well to the 
losing slate, which favored the outgoing president. 
  2. It is the result of changes in the makeup of the league's 
rank and file following the alleged Destourian "takeover bid." 
But the fact is that 23 members of the winning slate are members 
of the league's leadership structures, compared to 21 on the 
losing slate. 
  At the socioprofessional level, the winning slate, which 
some 
people describe for polemical reasons as a "second-rate" slate, 
includes three attorneys, two physicians, one inspector general 
of education, eight teachers, six journalists, three senior 
executives, and two midlevel executives. 
  Concerning the balloting, the winning slate received an 
average of 165 votes out of 310 validated ballots, while the 
losing slate received 90; 55 delegates [text missing]. 
  The top three names on the winning slate received votes from 
both "electorates": from 130 to 140 votes from the winning 
slate's "electorate" and from 65 to 98 votes from the second 
slate. 
  The group consisting of the POCT and its closely related 
extreme left-wing allies received the bloc vote of about 100 
delegates. 
<H5>  Three Concluding Remarks </H5>
  1. According to the French daily LIBERATION, the outgoing 
president said: "With the end of an independent league, the last 
democratic space has disappeared." 
  That statement is unacceptable, contemptuous, and insulting 
not only to the congress delegates meeting in Amilcar but also 
to the six members of the outgoing Managing Committee who were 
reelected after consistently and unanimously supporting him in 
adopting the 104 communiques and resolutions published during 
his term of office. And also to the 17 presidents, past 
presidents, or branch committee members who were on the winning 
slate, which includes four former political prisoners! 
  2. The will for independence is not a matter of slogans and 
verbal excesses. Independence means daily struggle by league 
members as part of a managing committee and of structures in 
continuity with the league. One proof of this was the high-level 
and essential debate regarding the law on associations. 
  It is a strange league: one that has allegedly abandoned its 
independence and been infiltrated and co-opted by the government 
but which, despite that, devoted seven hours to debating the law 
on associations in committee and in the plenary session of the 
congress and wound up unanimously declaring the need to repeal 
that law! The fact is that 140 delegates voted for a total and 
absolute rejection of the law, while 149 objected to it in clear 
and unambiguous terms but proposed measures intended to bring 
the league's structures into compliance with its provisions so 
as to avoid the law's negative effects on the league's autonomy. 
  3. This last remark, in the form of a regret, concerns the 
feminine presence among the candidates and winners in the 
elections for the Managing Committee. 
  Five women were candidates, three were elected, and that is 
a 
matter of concern to us. The matter deserves dispassionate 
reflection in order to zero in on the reasons for that imbalance 
and try to remedy it. Women made up an admittedly insufficient 
percentage of the delegates, but even that was slightly higher 
than the percentage of women candidates. Women constituted 11 
percent of the delegates and 9 percent of the candidates. That 
is too few for a league concerned with human rights.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "Human Rights Abuses Persist in </F>
India: U.S."] 
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 1--In a wide-ranging critique of 
the Indian law and order agencies, the U.S. State Department has 
said that "despite extensive constitutional and statutory 
safeguards, significant human rights abuses persist throughout 
India." The severe charges against India are part of the 
department's annual survey of human rights record of the 
governments worldwide, that was released here today. 
  The human rights abuses in India are "aggravated by severe 
social tensions and the authorities' attempts to contain violent 
secessionist movements," says the State Department. The abuses 
are particularly acute in disturbed areas such as Punjab and 
Kashmir, "where the judicial system has broken down in the face 
of terrorist threats." 
  Areas of abuse: The areas of abuse in India listed 
by the State Department is long and includes extra-judicial and 
reprisal killings by security forces in Kashmir, Punjab and the 
Northeast, political killings, kidnapping and extortion by 
militants, torture, rape and death in custody all over India, 
detention for prolonged periods without charges, inadequate 
prosecution of implicated personnel from the police and security 
forces, inter-caste and communal violence, legal discrimination 
and social violence against women, lax prosecution of dowry 
deaths and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded and 
child labour. 
  The State Department has been presenting these annual 
reports 
on human rights violations to the U.S. Congress since 1977. The 
U.S. Congress has been demanding that the country's foreign and 
trade policies take into account the performance of various 
countries on human rights and workers' rights. 
  Six sections: The reporting on each country is 
divided into six sections: respect for human rights, respect for 
civil liberties, practice of political rights, attitude to human 
rights activists, social discrimination and workers rights. 
Almost half of the report on India is devoted to the first 
section on violation of human rights, particularly in Punjab and 
Kashmir. 
  Although the militant groups come for some criticism, the 
fire of the State Department is reserved mostly for the Indian 
police and security forces. It is sharply critical of a number 
of the Indian legal instruments such as the Terrorist and 
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security 
Act, the conditions in Indian prisons, and the general 
functioning of the police and judicial system in dealing with 
militants. 
  Only modest results: The State Department notes 
that New Delhi has begun to address the international concerns 
on human rights violations in India by creating the Human Rights 
Commission and entering into a dialogue with international human 
rights groups. But it suggests that "these efforts have produced 
only modest results." 
  It notes the "Indian Government's claim that 146 security 
force personnel had been disciplined for acts of omission and 
commission during the operations in Kashmir over the past three 
years. Since the Indian Government did not publicise the forms 
of punishment or the crimes involved," it was impossible to 
judge the adequacy of the punishment." 
  It also notes that among the Kashmiris, "there is a general 
impression that official abuse goes unpunished." On New Delhi's 
relation to human rights activists in the country, the State 
Department says that despite the generally tolerant attitude, 
"human rights monitors have been targeted by the police for 
arrest and harassment." 
  T.N. Govt. flayed: On civil liberties, the State 
Department notes the Constitutional protection of freedom of 
speech and the press in India. It recognises the vigorous press 
in India but cites instances of harassment by the Government. It 
is critical of the Tamil Nadu Government for putting pressure on 
the opposition press and using "defamation charges in the courts 
to intimidate editors and journalists." 
  On freedom of religion, the State Department refers to the 
freedom of worship in India and notes the growing challenges to 
the secular foundation of the Indian State. It is sharply 
critical of the role of the Bombay police during the communal 
riots in that city during early 1993. 
  On discrimination against women, the State Department notes 
that despite an elaborate system of laws, "deeply rooted 
traditions lead to lax and some times no enforcement of these 
laws, especially in rural areas." On trade union rights, the 
survey reports the general respect for the right to organise, 
but comments that "as with other peripheral groups in Indian 
society, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers 
cannot always avail themselves of protections and rights 
guaranteed by law." 
  The survey notes that the eradication of bonded labour in 
India is only "proceeding slowly." It also says that the legal 
provisions in India have had little impact on the use of child 
labour.

  [Text] Bombay, Jan 24--Punjab director general of police 
K.P.S. Gill today said U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
presumptions on alleged human rights violations in Punjab were 
based on highly exaggerated figures propounded by pro-Khalistan 
forces in the west and were so far removed from the ground 
realities as to be entirely out of proportion to the situation. 
  Mr Gill told reporters here that even Amnesty International 
in its latest report on Punjab had presumed that all the 
"disappearances" from the villages were "the work of the 
police," while the true state of facts was that "even we are 
looking for these boys." 
  He said one of the facts mentioned in President Clinton's 
letter to pro- Khalistani forces in the United States referred 
to 60,000 prisoners in Punjab's jails while, in fact, the total 
capacity of jails in the State was only about 8,000." And, at 
the moment, we have only 750 plus terrorists in prison." 
  However, the Central Government has given an adequate reply 
to the U.S. President, he said. 
<H5>  Amnesty claims </H5>
  Elaborating on Amnesty International's claims, the Punjab 
Police chief said the alleged disappearances of youths from the 
State was largely caused by their migration to the west on false 
or forged documents. These youths later resurfaced in the United 
States or European nations and, while on the point of 
deportation back to India by unsympathic foreign governments, 
were allegedly picked up by Pakistan's Inter-Services 
Intelligence (ISI) for recruitment in their terrorist forces. 
  "We are as much interested in looking for these boys (about 
500 altogether from Jalandhar, Hosiarpur and Kapurthala) as is 
Amnesty International. In fact, many of these boys have been 
picked up by the Amnesty International itself," Mr Gill said. 
  He said a group of Canadian members of Parliament, fed with 
reports of such disappearances on a recent visit to the State, 
were amazed to come across the vibrant lives of youths in 
Punjab's villages, and had to admit that the streets of Punjab 
were not devoid of young Sikhs as claimed by some forces 
operating in the west. 
  About his success in controlling the situation in Punjab, Mr 
Gill said "I was relatively more successful in containing 
violence in Assam than I have been in Punjab. The situations are 
very different and need a study of the ground realities before 
they can be tackled in an individual manner. All that it needs 
is a commitment to the task in hand." 
<H5>  Punjab formula </H5>
  He denied that the Punjab formula would work equally well in 
Kashmir as the situation there was different. "You cannot 
duplicate situations. Assam was not Punjab and Punjab is not 
Kashmir. You can't go into these situations with pre-conceived 
notions," he said. 
  Mr Gill said there had been no change in Pakistan's attitude 
toward terrorism in Punjab as was evident from the statements of 
Dr Sohan Singh who had revealed that about eight to ten 
separatist groups each with two or three leaders were still 
active in that country and were being urged by Pakistani forces 
to press in more recruits to terrorism. 
  The people of Punjab, however, were fed up with violence 
which was beginning to prove counter-productive to the terrorist 
forces. "The people do not want to be subjected to any further 
violence. This is a major factor that will ensure that there is 
no return of terrorism to Punjab," Mr Gill said. 
  At the moment there were only 25 hard core terrorists at 
large of which ten were in Pakistan and others either in Europe 
or the United States, he said. "They are generally travelling 
around but we get information of their re-entry into Punjab very 
early and apprehend them within hours."

<F P=106> [Article by Aabha Dixit: "Yours Insincerely"] </F>
  [Text] In less than two weeks the United States 
administration has come perilously close to undoing the progress 
made over the last few years in its bilateral relations with 
India. In an unusual burst of letter writing, the U.S. 
president, Mr Bill Clinton, has raised the familiar ghosts that 
haunted U.S.-Indian relations in the past. 
  In the first instance he replied to a Pakistani propagandist 
based in Washington, Mr Ghulam Nabi Fai. This allowed Islamabad 
to go to town releasing the contents of the letter. Mr Clinton 
then shot off a second letter within the fortnight to an obscure 
California congressman, Mr Gary Condit, reviving the phantom of 
"the threatened position of Sikhs in the Indian Union." 
  The timing of the two letters sent by Mr Clinton to persons 
with known links has raised eyebrows in New Delhi about the real 
intention behind his move. U.S.-Indian relations in the first 
year of the Clinton presidency have not made rapid progress. 
This is partly due to the U.S. president's preoccupation with 
domestic issues. 
  On the foreign policy front Mr Clinton was concerned with 
the 
bigger question arising out of the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union and the inherent instability in Russia. South Asia was 
given a separate existence by the state department. But the 
inability of the administration to either fill the post of 
assistant secretary of state for the area or send an envoy to 
New Delhi reflected the interest Washington has shown in the 
region during the past year. By creating a separate bureau south 
Asia may have won some individual standing within the system. 
But in doing so, the region has also been made vulnerable to the 
whims and fancies of one individual. 
  In the earlier system the region was placed within the near 
east bureau. Any major policy initiative went all the way up the 
ladder to the deputy secretary of state. It meant the personal 
prejudices behind individual decision making were put to 
scrutiny. 
  The absence of a clear cut policy for south Asia has been 
evident throughout the first year of the Clinton presidency. 
Administration officials have made confusing statements. No 
particular interest in India has been shown, save to look at it 
through the prism of the administration's global interest of 
drawing nuclear hold outs into the nuclear nonproliferation net. 
  The Indian Space Research Organisation-Glavkosmos 
controversy 
sparked the first major rift between Washington and New Delhi. 
The United States unveiled its missile and space technology 
denial policy through Mr Clinton's speech at the United Nations 
in September 1993. India had no option but to oppose 
Washington's attempts to unilaterally choke the supply of high 
technology to countries trying to develop space vehicles. Such 
development challenged Washington's commercial supremacy in the 
field. 
  The issue is delicately poised even today. Russia is 
vertically split on the question of supplying cryogenic rockets. 
Suggestions have been made that India be admitted to the missile 
technology control regime as a full participating member. The 
United States has argued this would require the consent of the 
member states. 
  The second obstacle to improving bilateral ties is 
Washington's policy of preaching on Kashmir. The architect of 
this policy is the newly appointed assistant secretary of state, 
Ms Robin Raphel, who returned from New Delhi to take up the new 
job. Ms Raphel, in her new avatar as the prima donna of 
subcontinental affairs, has been exhibiting an imperiousness 
wholly out of place with the underlying principles of 
Washington's envisaged "new world order." 
  The third contention concerns the reprocessing plant at 
Tarapur. The United States insists that notwithstanding the 
extension of the safeguards agreement with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, India cannot run the plant without earning 
U.S. displeasure and possible retaliation. Not only does the 
U.S. diktat go against the terms of the international agreement, 
it speaks volumes on the confidence the United States has in the 
IAEA safeguards system which the United States itself insisted 
on creating in the Fifties. 
  The fourth thorn troubling U.S.-India relations is 
Washington's attitude towards Pakistan's attempts to destabilise 
India and its aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme. 
During the last year of the Bush administration, Islamabad's 
responsibility for the abysmal situation in Kashmir was 
recognised. Pakistan was issued a series of warnings to stop 
backing Kashmiri militants. If it failed it would be placed on 
the infamous list of terrorist states. 
  The exit of Mr George Bush got Islamabad off the hook. The 
Clinton administration was curiously unable to act upon the 
evidence already at hand. It sent signals to Pakistan that 
terrorism and covert destabilisation were not high enough on its 
agenda to merit instant reaction. This resulted in the attempt 
of Pakistani-sponsored militants storming the Hazratbal mosque. 
  That effort failed. Islamabad, confident Washington would 
not 
punish it for its covert support to Kashmiri militants, has now 
launched a major propaganda offensive to keep Kashmir alive at 
international fora. Washington's escape hatch of pursuing an 
"even handed policy" in the subcontinent prevents the United 
States from publicly "advising" Ms Benazir Bhutto of the 
dangerous consequences of brinkmanship. 
  Also intriguing is Washington's response to Islamabad's 
attempts to make its nuclear weapons status public. The Clinton 
administration is compelled by domestic political considerations 
to get the better of the legislative branch in the conduct of 
foreign policy. It therefore generally supports the repeal of 
the Pressler Amendment. Islamabad has been seeking the 
amendment's abolition, arguing it gives New Delhi a veto over 
the future state of relations in the subcontinent. In a bid to 
entangle both India and Pakistan into a bilateral nuclear 
nonproliferation deal, the U.S. administration has pursued the 
flawed concept of the five nation deal. This has been resisted 
by New Delhi. 
  Mr Clinton's letters come at a time when the U.S. 
administration is taking an interest in foreign policy issues 
after a successful tour of Russia and east Europe. In Ukraine, 
Belarus and Kazakhstan, the United States has successfully 
pushed a "money for denuclearisation" strategy. It appears to 
have made some progress in this direction. Conditions in south 
Asia are not similar and therein lie possible clues to the 
motives behind the letters. 
  This is not the first time interested congressmen and 
political lobbyists have written to a U.S. president. It is 
arguable whether U.S. presidents have replied to all letters as 
a matter of "courtesy." It is also doubtful Mr Fai and Mr Condit 
corresponded with the president for the first time. 
  Mr Fai is a regular participant in Pakistani television 
programmes beamed via satellite. He has actively sought the 
support of influential people in Washington for Islamabad's 
cause. He almost certainly would have written to various 
administrations in the past, if not received a reply. One 
wonders if Mr Clinton would reply to every letter Indians wrote 
him. 
  The case of Mr Condit is even more intriguing. He is an 
obscure politician roped in by Islamabad to take up issues at 
its behest. By selectively harping on the human rights of a 
particular community, Mr Condit has sought to revive the 
Khalistan movement. Mr Clinton fell for the bait and replied in 
the same vein, ignoring that human rights excesses are common to 
all countries. In India or even Punjab it is not Sikhs alone 
whose human rights have been trampled upon. 
  Punjab has beaten back the challenge of militancy. If human 
rights excesses have occurred, legal mechanisms exist for people 
to seek redressal. Punjab is not Bosnia. The press briefing of 
the U.S. spokeswoman threw up an even more bizarre viewpoint. 
She is reported to have said Washington could ask the state 
government directly about its human rights excesses. 
  All this leads to the question why Washington took the 
calculated risk of issuing the controversial letters. Two 
factors could perhaps have influenced the course of action. One, 
the personal predilections of the assistant secretary of state 
who obviously had some axes to grind following her stay in New 
Delhi. Two, Washington must have realised some countervailing 
pressure had to be put on India for refusing a comprehensive 
south Asia nuclear and missile deal with Pakistan. 
  With a year to go before the nonproliferation treaty review 
conference, Washington is getting restless. Universal 
application will continue to elude the treaty in its present 
form. The upshot of such countervailing pressure is they could 
derail the train of economic cooperation India and the United 
States have put together over the years. This is an issue in 
which the United States has more at stake than ordinary 
commercial interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Kenneth C. Brill: "All's Well Between India and </F>
U.S."] 
  [Text] Pick up a newspaper these days and it is hard to 
avoid the impression that Indo-U.S. relations are at a low ebb. 
In this age of instant communications, even minor events can be 
blown out of proportion overnight, over-interpreted and 
attributed far greater importance than they can possibly 
deserve. But despite some of the recent headlines and 
commentary, Indo-U.S. relations are on a sounder and more 
substantial footing than they have been in decades. I believe 
this reflects the new importance each country attaches to the 
relationship. 
  The relations are broad and complex, running the gamut from 
education, technology and trade to help to build a post-cold war 
world that reflects our shared democratic values. Most of the 
work in the context goes on quietly, away from the media 
spotlight, carried out by men and women in government, the 
private sector, voluntary and professional organisations and 
educational institutions. Their daily activities weave the 
fabric of the relationship and, in the process, linkages are 
developed, common interests identified and problems (new and 
old) are tackled. 
<H5>  Bilateral Agenda </H5>
  India and the United States have a more complicated and 
ambitious bilateral agenda than ever before, a result of the 
opportunity the changes in the post-cold war world provide for 
our countries to expand and strengthen relations. This agenda 
demands two things of us: the vision to recognise and build upon 
those areas where our economic and political interests converge, 
and the willingness to engage in the hard work of reducing the 
differences in those areas where we disagree. From economic 
reform to environmental protection, from non-proliferation to 
peace-keeping, the United States and India have identified 
areas of constructive engagement and have begun substantive 
dialogue at a variety of official and unofficial levels. 
  To what, then, can one attribute the gap between the reality 
of our relationship and the public perception? To a great 
extent, I attribute it to the turbulent times in which we live. 
Political change is occurring at a dizzying pace, and it is 
forcing every nation--including, let me stress, the United 
States--to reconsider long-held assumptions and re-examine old 
relationships. 
  Always difficult, this process is further complicated when 
it 
involves the world's two largest democracies, with a shared 
tradition of vigorous, unfettered public debate. Both our 
political systems accommodate a wide range of views. Opposition 
politicians criticise government policies freely; advocacy 
groups, lobbyists and private voluntary organisations all work 
strenuously to gain public support for their positions. These 
are healthy manifestations of our democratic systems. 
<H5>  Justifiably Proud </H5>
  More often than not, this debate takes place in our media. 
Both the United States and India are justifiably proud of a free 
press, which serves a vital role informing public debate. But 
the nature of the business is that conflict makes news. As a 
result, most of us are more familiar with the well-publicised 
differences--real or imagined--between our two nations than the 
positive developments taking place away from the media spotlight. 
  Let me cite a few examples of positive developments in the 
relationship: The United States is actively and materially 
supporting India's economic-reform programme. Ours is the 
largest market for India's exports: we buy 20 per cent of what 
India sells abroad. We also are the largest foreign investor in 
India. Last year, new U.S. investment represented over 42 per 
cent of the more than $2 billion total approved by the 
government of India. Every dollar of this investment is a vote 
of confidence in India's future. 
  The Unites States is India's largest technology partner. 
Thirty-six years ago, Indian and American scientists began 
working together in areas such as medicine, agriculture and the 
environment. Today, this programme is the largest of its kind in 
the world, and has created a substantial body of scholarship and 
a tradition of collaborative effort that many nations strive to 
emulate. In addition, through licensing and joint-venture 
arrangements, the United States is the largest source of foreign 
commercial technology for Indian industry. 
  Indo-U.S. military co-operation has grown in recent years. 
Our armed forces have worked together on U.N. peace-keeping 
missions in Cambodia and Somalia. In addition, our military ties 
have expanded to include joint steering groups, joint exercises, 
training programmes and staff exchanges. 
  Our law-enforcement agencies work closely combating the 
threat posed by international terrorism and narcotics 
trafficking. At present, we are in the process of negotiating a 
new Indo-U.S. extradition treaty that will enhance the judicial 
process in both countries, enabling us to better confront these 
threats to global security. 
<H5>  Better Measure </H5>
  Even in areas where we differ, we have been able to expand 
our shared agenda. Despite differences on the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty, for example, we agree on other aspects 
of non-proliferation--the comprehensive test-ban treaty, and the 
fissile fuel cut-off. In addition, our two governments worked 
closely in the final stages of the chemical weapons convention. 
  These developments are a better measure of the quality of 
Indo-U.S. relations today and their promising future than the 
headlines trumpeting our differences. Differences are inevitable 
when nations engage each other seriously on complex issues. 
Rather than be dismayed, we should be encouraged by the 
evolution taking place from the carefully-circumscribed dialogue 
of the past to the constructive engagement that characterises 
our relationship at present. 
  No doubt, our open political systems will generate a certain 
amount of surface turbulence between us. The challenge our two 
countries face is to remain focused on what is important: the 
steady advance towards more mature, productive and collaborative 
relations. Both sides have made a good start in this direction, 
and I can affirm the United States Government looks forward to 
continuing to work in this spirit with the government and people 
of India now and in the years ahead.

  [Excerpt] It is hard to believe that the President of the 
most powerful state in the world should be so grievously 
ill-informed about the situation prevailing in different regions 
and hazard opinions on them without concern with the 
consequences his words may have. I refer to President Clinton's 
recent pronouncement on the Punjab. Personally he may not know 
the distance between Tarn Taran and Timbuctoo but he has a large 
embassy in New Delhi which must keep him informed of the ground 
realities of the Punjab of today. And the ground reality is that 
terrorists who had been losing ground have been wiped out. 
  They forfeited the little sympathy they had among the 
peasantry as they degenerated from being politically or 
religiously motivated to gangs of thugs bent on loot, murder and 
rape. More than the Army or the police, it was the peasantry of 
the Punjab which barred their doors against them. 
  I have no doubt that there must have been incidents of 
police 
high-handedness and violation of human rights, as they would be 
in the best organised societies in the world faced by goons who 
have no respect for laws or norms of civilised behaviour. 
  In the Punjab they were not on so large a scale as to invite 
censure from the head of a friendly state. More unpardonable 
than ignorance of the changed situation in the Punjab is the 
White House lending ear to the culmination of a handful of 
emigrants styling themselves as the Council of Khalistan. 
Whatever support there was for Khalistan has eroded leaving one 
man with a tiny office in Washington publishing grossly 
exaggerated stories of anti-Sikh repression by the Punjab police 
and para-military forces. This one man financed by a rich farmer 
in California has, however, established contacts with members of 
the American Congress and Senators and raised funds for them. In 
return they make anti-Indian noises in Congress and the Senate. 
It may not be too bad an idea for our Government to extend 
invitations to these American politicians to visit the Punjab, 
talk to the people including erstwhile terrorists and see things 
for themselves. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Sees Reason"] </F>
  [Text] "My experience in public life suggests that there is 
far more value to keeping my mouth shut at times than to 
speaking" was Republican senator, Mr Hank Brown's riposte to 
Assistant Secretary of State, Ms Robin L. Raphel, during the 
U.S. senate foreign policy panel hearing on South Asian affairs. 
The season of reason seems to have just dawned on Washington 
politics. The American flip-flop on strategic issues, especially 
issues concerning the sub-continent never ceases to amaze policy 
watchers. India is one day a primitive, human rights abuser and 
becomes a non-cooperative nuclear nation another day, all thanks 
to the benevolence and quirkiness of Washington ditherers. Till 
yesterday, President Bill Clinton was testing his writing skills 
on the Punjab issue and trying his vocal chords on the Kashmir 
absurdities. As if to prove the promptness of his administration 
in dealing with strategic issues with immediacy, his staff was 
very prompt in responding to dubious organisations and painted 
India as a country of primitive inhabitants bent upon killing 
each other. Today, suddenly, the Clinton administration comes 
across precious evidence that India is a very big country, that 
there is a thriving democracy which has over a long period of 
time evolved democratic institutions and is in the process of 
addressing human rights abuses and adhering to international 
human rights standards. One is certain many Indian hearts swell 
with pride at hearing such pious outpourings by the greatest 
democracy on earth. But what explains for the American policy of 
yesterday? Did policy makers in Washington not realise that 
India with its continental dimensions, inhabited by different 
ethnic, religious and language groups, surrounded on one side by 
a country bent upon stoking the fires of terrorism and 
separatism, remain incident-free, trouble-free and 
violence-free? Why has it taken the Yanks so long to realise 
that the Government of India was doing its best to come to grips 
with an extremely volatile situation in a manner that at the 
same time did not lead to much loss of life? Why did it not 
recognise that the thousands of humans who sacrificed their 
lives to bring peace to the Punjab were policemen, who became 
common fodder to the terrorist bullets? Should a developing 
country spend enormous amounts of money and hire American 
lobbyists to open the eyes of lords in Washington to see home 
truths about India? It is pathetic to see a super power which is 
so indecisive. One only hopes that it does not chance upon some 
new evidence, suitable to its needs, and change its policy 
tomorrow. The loser would not be India, for, international 
community knows by now, the human rights record of India. It is 
the United States of America that will lose its face. In its own 
self-interest, the United States needs to evolve a realistic, 
long-term strategy for the sub-continent.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, January 30--For those who were willing to 
see, there is nothing unique about the denoucement in 
Indo-American relations. Its basis was the mis-matched set of 
expectations of the two countries, the so-called "world's 
largest democracies." 
  India, which had a "special relationship" with the Soviet 
Union, after its collapse sought to establish similar 
relationship with the United States. However, all that the 
United States wanted was a subservient "poor relative" in the 
Indian Ocean region. For this reason, even while the United 
States invested in India's economic future, it has made it 
clear that it is not willing to see India complicate the 
world's power balance by becoming a power like China. 
  India could, if it wanted to, become a Germany or a Japan, 
whose foreign and security policies would be aligned to, or 
guided by Washington, all in the interests of global stability 
and peace. 
  So the primary effort of the United States in India in the 
past one year has been on the proliferation front. Additional 
countries acquiring nuclear weapons are the "joker in the 
pack"(as THE ECONOMIST describes it) that are liable to upset 
the present international card game. One pincer of this policy 
is to delay and halt any addition to India's technological 
capabilities that can assist in the making of long-range 
missiles. 
  This was the background to the American demand on the 
Russians to block the technology transfer component of the 
cryogenic motor deal, as well as the autumn demarche to halt the 
deployment of missiles. (This, notwithstanding that Pakistan has 
deployed short range missiles on the Indian border for the past 
two years and Indian deployments are at least a year away!) 
  The second and more dangerous leg of this policy is to use 
Indian difficulties in Kashmir to compel India to freeze and 
roll back its nuclear weapons options--essentially enter into 
bilateral or multilateral agreements to place all its nuclear 
facilities under safeguards and declare all stocks of fissile 
material. 
  So in a kind of an international "Mutt and Jeff" show, 
Pakistan is encouraged to threaten India with nuclear war, and 
India is told how dangerous things are and that it must 
co-operate to end the threat to regional and world peace. For 
that reason, Pakistan's role in facilitating and aiding 
terrorist activity in India are ignored. 
  The tone and tenor of recent remarks indicate that while the 
Americans do not recognise India as a "problem" state as they 
did in the 1970s or early 1980s, they do not see it as requiring 
any high-level attention either. No American President has 
visited India since Mr Jimmy Carter, nor for that matter, has 
any secretary of state come in the past decade. There does not 
seem to be any plans for any visits in the near future either. 
  The Americans have managed without an ambassador to India. 
Of 
the three high-level meetings that Mr S.S. Ray managed in 
Washington, two were with the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, whose 
task was to push the reluctant Indians to commit forces in 
Somalia. The third was with the secretary of state, Mr Warren 
Christopher, on the eve of his visit to India in November in the 
wake of the Robin Raphel imbroglio. 
  There is a love-hate relationship between India and the 
United States. But the reality is that all the loving and hating 
is done by India. For its part, the United States scarcely 
notices India. As long as India remains poor or militarily weak, 
this situation will remain unaltered. India being a democracy or 
an "open" society does not count for much; most American 
policy-makers would take objection to America being placed in 
the same slot with India on these two counts. Their reference is 
all right as long as it is confined to provide the rhetorical 
flourish to joint statements and declarations. 
  It is against this background that one has to understand the 
strange state of Indo-American relations today. At the political 
level, relations between the two countries have never been so 
good. The end of the Soviet Union has eliminated all suspicions 
in America about India's geopolitical perspectives. Likewise, 
official India believes that all is well and that the continuing 
dialogue between the two countries has persuaded America to come 
around to India's long-held views on disarmament. 
  America finds it difficult to deal with the third world, 
especially non-white nations in a framework of equality that the 
international system demands, in form if not in content. So 
there are problems in assigning a place to India. A major share 
of the problem lies in India itself. It has not decided what it 
wants to be and so it does not seem to be moving anywhere. It 
has not built up military power and, thus, not quite sought 
great power status, yet it is not quite willing to renounce it. 
Poverty and persisting misgovernance make mockery of its claim 
to be taken seriously as a great nation. Under Mr P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, it is attempting to achieve this through another path--that 
of economic growth. 
  The loudest applause is coming from America. America appears 
to be bullish about India's economic prospects and companies 
like Coca Cola, IBM, and a host of others have made the United 
States the leading investor in India, just as it makes it 
India's largest trading partner. Were relations to be confined 
to the economy or commerce, there would not be much of a 
problem. With India signing the GATT treaty, even the remaining 
ones have been more or less resolved. 
  The real difficulties, however, arise from America's 
perceived role for itself as the only superpower. The 
contradictions in America's positions come through its advocacy 
of a test ban even though it has carried out the highest number 
of nuclear test explosions, or its call for India and other 
countries to desist from producing fissile materials for nuclear 
weapons, while the United States itself is acquiring some 500 
tonnes of the stuff from the erstwhile Soviet Union. 
  The biggest stumbling block, however, appears to be 
America's 
political and cultural perceptions of India. Instead of being 
more understanding of India's efforts to construct a nation on 
the basis of modern nationalism, a liberal democracy without 
regard to caste, creed or colour, the United States, in the name 
of human rights, seems to want to encourage sub-national forces 
who proclaim the right to nationhood on the basis of religion or 
ethnicity. From these strategic misunderstandings arise the 
seemingly minor yet damaging, difficulties over Kashmir, Punjab, 
or the cryogenic engines.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Secretary May Help Break </F>
Trade Barriers"] 
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 2--The U.S. Commerce Secretary, Mr. 
Ron Brown, is likely to visit India later this year. At a 
meeting here yesterday with Mr. Brown, the Indian Ambassador, 
Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray extended the invitation. His 
acceptance is probably an important step in overcoming the 
current political obstacles to the Indo-U.S. relationship and 
giving it a new economic and commercial focus. 
  The details of the visit will be worked out in due course. 
The expectations are that it could take place around August. 
When it happens it will be first visit to India by a 
Cabinet-level official from the United States in more than half 
a decade. The absence of sustained high level political and 
economic interaction has been a major impediment to the 
improvement of bilateral relations. 
  Mr. Ron Brown is no ordinary politician. He is the first 
African-American in the United States to hold the post of 
Commerce Secretary. Until now the African-American 
representation in the Cabinet has been symbolic and without 
significance. Mr. Brown may have broken that glass ceiling. 
Before his appointment to the Cabinet in the Clinton 
administration, Mr. Brown headed the Democratic National 
Committee and managed the first successful democratic bid for 
Presidency in 12 years. Although hobbled by some scandals, Mr. 
Brown has brought an unprecedented energy to the department. 
  With the emphasis of the Clinton administration on 
revitalising economic strength, Mr. Brown has successfully 
pushed the Commerce department towards the front and centre of 
economic diplomacy. Insisting that exports are the key to 
American economic growth and its international competitiveness, 
Mr. Brown has given a new weight to the Commerce department in 
the inter-agency wrangles within the Clinton administration on 
export controls. He has helped the department win the battle for 
substantive liberalisation of regulations on exports of such 
dual use technologies as computers and telecommunication 
equipment. 
  Elusive thrust: Despite the proclaimed emphasis of 
the administration on enlarging democracies and free markets, an 
economic thrust to the Indo-U.S. relationship had remained 
elusive. The South Asia Bureau in the State department had 
focussed on a mechanical application of the slogans of human 
rights and non-proliferation, besides a futile but activist 
diplomacy on Kashmir in its approach to India. The agenda only 
helped derail the relationship. 
  Though enthusiasm was lacking in the State department for 
making mutually beneficial trade the centrepiece of relations, 
there has been a dramatic surge in American commercial interest 
in India. Since the reforms began in 1991, the United States has 
emerged the largest single foreign investor in India, 
contributing more than 40 per cent of total direct foreign 
investment approved. The trade between the two countries has 
dramatically expanded American exports in the first 11 months of 
1993 increased by an impressive 38 per cent, notwithstanding the 
overall stagnation in India's imports. India's exports 
registered a respectable 20 per cent in the same period. The 
annual bilateral trade is approaching the level of $7,000 
millions, with a surplus in favour of India. 
  For all the remarkable movement on the trade front, India 
had 
largely remained out of the American strategic commercial focus, 
at least till recently. Even as political setbacks to the 
relationship mounted in the recent months, there have been signs 
of expanding American economic attention to India. A few days 
ago, the Under-Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, 
Mr. Jeffrey E. Garten, announced that the Commerce department 
was unveiling a new strategy for the "big emerging markets" in 
the developing world. India was identified as one such. Last 
week, speaking to foreign correspondents, Mr. Brown confirmed 
the new approach towards big emerging markets, and declared his 
intent to end the "neglect of India." 
  It is in this context that the Indian embassy here has 
broached the subject of the Commerce Secretary's visit to New 
Delhi. As in the past trade and economic cooperation continue to 
follow the flag. A signal from Washington and New Delhi that the 
two sides are keen on expanding the relationship is likely to 
give a big boost to commercial interaction. Mr. Brown is 
expected to lead a large contingent of businessmen when he 
visits India. Besides the visit, a number of issues of immediate 
interest were discussed at the meeting between Mr. Brown and Mr. 
Ray. 
  India is keen that Washington lift non-tariff barriers to 
software exports to United States, most notably the visa 
restrictions. India is pressing for a long-term renewal of the 
bilateral preferential trading arrangements in areas where it is 
now a strong exporter. New Delhi is eager to ensure that India 
has better access to the American market in technology, and 
wants the United States to bring greater transparency and 
predictability to export control mechanisms.

  [Text] Mr Dhanik Lal Mandal, Haryana Governor laid the 
foundation stone of the building of American Institute of Indian 
Studies (AIIS) in Gurgaon on Thursday. The building costing 
about Rs[rupees] three crore to be constructed within two years. 
  Addressing an elite gathering on this occasion Mr Mandal 
complimented the Institute for its positive contribution for 
promoting studies on India in American universities. He said 
that both India and USA share the common faith in the democratic 
ideals. Mr Mandal recalled that festival of America in India and 
festival of India in USA have helped in bringing the people of 
our two nations closer. He said that about 18,000 Indians are 
studying in American universities and a number of students and 
scholars from the USA are in the institution of higher learning 
in our country. Under the aegis of American Institute of Indian 
Studies about 100 to 120 scholars are brought to India every 
year to do research in different fields. 
  During the last 32 years of its existence the AIIS, a 
non-government organisation, has enabled 2,000 scholars to come 
to work in India. It has also published for subsidised 
publication about 2,000 books on India. 
  Mr Mandal said that on account of fellowship programmes a 
number of universities where Indian studies are taught has 
increased to 70 whereas in the 60's this number was less than a 
dozen. 
  Mr Mandal expressed the belief that the recent shift in the 
emphasis on the Chinese, Japanese studies languages, culture, 
arts and economy in American universities will not affect the 
funding of higher education and studies on India.

  [Text] New Delhi, January 24--The boundary dispute with 
Pakistan spills on to the high seas with the latter unwilling to 
demarcate the International Boundary Line (IBL) to maintain the 
exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the director general of Coast 
Guard, Vice-Admiral Kailash Kohli, said on Saturday. 
  Addressing newspersons on the roles of the Coast Guard, 
which 
celebrates its 17th raising day on February 1, he said there has 
been "constant friction" between the Coast Guard and Pakistan's 
maritime security agency on account of this. 
  While India has well-demarcated IBL with other countries 
like 
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia, no 
settlement has been reached with Pakistan, he said. 
  "The issue has remained unresolved for over a decade with 
India suggesting to adopt the internationally accepted median 
line principle which is not acceptable to Pakistan," Admiral 
Kohli said. 
  The Coast Guard chief said even though there were many 
discussions with Pakistan on the matter, the dispute continues 
and Pakistan earlier suggested the "mid-stream principle." 
Vice-Admiral Kohli said the Coast Guard, which has over 6,800-km 
of the Indian coastline to police, has faced threats but has 
maintained dominance. 
  He said apart from threats there have been attempts by the 
Pakistan maritime security agency to ram into other boats but 
there have been no incidents of opening fire. 
  The Coast Guard has projected a futuristic requirement of 50 
ships, 42 helicopters and 45 planes including half-a-dozen 
medium range surveillance aircraft to augment its present fleet 
in order to ensure proper vigil.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Her War-Like Posture"] </F>
  [Text] Benazir Bhutto's first tenure as the Prime Minister 
of Pakistan was noteworthy for the keen interest she took in an 
amicable settlement of her country's problems with India. Her 
second term which began three months ago is more than likely to 
be different altogether. What is under way currently is in fact 
her creeping metamorphosis into the stereotyped Pakistani leader 
obsessed with enhancing Pakistan's military might. The virtual 
rejection by Islamabad of the very idea of keeping up a serious 
dialogue with India after the recent talks between the two 
Foreign Secretaries is thus not accidental. It seems to be a 
part of a strategy hardly distinguishable from that of all the 
past military rulers of that country. Its main emphasis is on 
war-like talk most of the time and war-like preparations all the 
time. Benazir has already said much to convince Pakistan's 
military elite that both of them are on the same wavelength. Her 
belligerence on Kashmir and her bid to deflate the notion of a 
dialogue with India have amply served this purpose. 
  Benazir Bhutto is now unfolding the second part of her 
policy, viz, to appease the military top brass in more concrete 
terms. This paper's correspondent in Davos in Switzerland has 
shed light on the Pakistan Prime Minister's shopping mission in 
the European arms bazaar. Apparently, a deal for the acquisition 
of one or more submarines from the Swedish shipbuilding company, 
Kockums, is on the cards. She has taken care to keep up an 
anti-Indian tirade even as she participates in the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, and keeps herself busier with less 
publicised arms negotiations. 
  Such activities become significant especially in the 
background of an increasing pressure on Benazir Bhutto's 
government for a sharp hike in the defence budget. Air Marshal 
(Retd) Ayaz Ahmad Khan has just called for raising the defence 
expenditure from 90 billion to 150 billion rupees "to achieve 
numerical and qualitatively military balance with Pakistan's 
foremost enemy." He wants that Pakistan must have more infantry, 
armoured artillery and air defence formations "to correct the 
two-to-one Indian advantage in troop strength." The so-called 
imbalance to Pakistan's disadvantage can be easily seen to be a 
myth when it is remembered that the percentage of its military 
spending relative to its gross domestic product is far higher 
than that of India and any Western democracy. But it is not just 
tell-tale figures of expenditure that are involved here. 
Pakistan's political system, some democratic trappings 
notwithstanding, is essentially a military-dominated one. Time 
was when Benazir Bhutto wanted a full-fledged democracy with the 
generals having no political role to play. Of late, she seems to 
have found it expedient not to insist on the soldiers going back 
to the barracks. What seems to be going on is militarisation 
under civilian aegis. The military-civilian confrontation is 
yielding place to collusion. Another "historic compromise?"

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 27--South Africa and some other 
African countries have agreed to a recent proposal to have a 
trade bloc of Indian Ocean rim states, and Zimbabwe has agreed 
to prepare a draft paper for exchange of views among countries 
of the rim on the proposal. 
  Stating this here today after his return from a two-week 
visit to four African countries--South Africa, Mozambique, 
Zimbabwe and Botswana--Minister of State for External Affairs 
Salman Khursheed said such a grouping has great scope for 
collaborating with ASEAN and Australia. He said the African 
National Congress in South Africa has shown interest in the 
idea, which was mooted by South African Foreign Minister R.F. 
Botha during his visit to India last year. 
  Mr Khursheed, who was in South Africa from January 12-14, 
said South African businessmen have shown interest in investing 
in the tourism sector. 
  This was the second visit by the Minister in the last six 
months to South Africa which, after emerging from the apartheid 
era, is expected to hold multi-party elections in three months.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Germany has responded favourably 
to the Indian request for greater access to German technology 
and to its middle-level industry for partnership. 
  The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, during his just-concluded visit to Germany of 
clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding 
Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his 
ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic 
cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process. 
  Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their 
efforts for further democratisation of the United Nations, to 
reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of 
the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent 
members with veto. Both India and Germany are keen for a place 
in the extended Security Council with veto power. 
  In the next few months three high-level delegations from 
Germany, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for 
Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign 
Minister are slated to visit India to provide fresh impetus to 
growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields. 
  According to official sources in the External Affairs 
Ministry, in the context of German view of playing an important 
role in world affairs, Bonn has formulated a priority programme, 
"Asia concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high 
growth" Asian countries like Japan, China and India. The market 
in Russia and Europe was not considered to be sufficient to meet 
the growing German capabilities in fields like science, 
technology, economic, investment abroad. 
  These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future 
large-scale German investments could be expected in various 
spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit 
and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the 
outcome of the visit so early. 
  However, Mr Rao himself said that he was satisfied with the 
outcome of his German visit. 
  These sources further pointed out that the reception the 
Prime Minister received in Germany was much warmer and greater 
than the one he received during his first visit in September 
1991. 
  These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's 
talks 
with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated 
by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the 
talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the 
German official sources also denied having given any such 
briefing at all.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan 21--India and Myanmar have signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation between their 
civilian border authorities, to prevent illegal and negative 
activities namely, trans-border movement of insurgents, 
narco-traffickers and smugglers having adverse impact on the 
economy as well as the socio-cultural and political fabric of 
the two countries. 
  The MoU was initialled here on Friday by Mr N.N. Vohra, the 
Union Home Secretary, on behalf of India and by Mr Wynn Lwin, 
the Ambassador of Myanmar. The signing ceremony took place in 
the presence of the Union Minister of State for Home, Mr P.M. 
Sayeed, and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Myanmar, Mr Nyunt 
Swe, who is currently visiting India as the head of a 
seven-member delegation of his country. 
  The Foreign Secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, and India's Ambassador 
to Myanmar, Mr G. Parthasarthy, were also present at the signing 
ceremony. 
  The two governments have agreed to take all necessary 
measures to prevent inadvertent violations of each other's 
territory by their security forces. They would also monitor and 
curb effectively all illegal and negative activities such as 
trans-border movement of insurgents, narco-traffickers and 
others involved in nafarious activities. Meetings between 
civilian border authorities would be held at the sectoral level 
on a quarterly basis, and at the national level on an annual 
basis. 
  The government considers the MoU a positive step and intends 
to follow up on it quickly and effectively through certain 
well-considered initiatives. The MoU is motivated by the shared 
desire of the two governments to maintain good neighbourly 
relations and to set up an effective consultation mechanism for 
maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border. 
  India shares a long boundary with Myanmar extending 1,643 km 
from Arunachal Pradesh to Mizoram. The terrain along the border 
belt is densely forested and consists of steep and high mountain 
ranges. The border is almost open and porous with numerous 
jungle routes, a fact that helps smugglers, drug-traffickers, 
insurgents and other trans-border criminals to pursue their 
illegal activities across the border. 
  A border trade agreement was also concluded between the two 
countries on Friday. It was signed by Mr. Tejendra Khanna, the 
Commerce Secretary, on behalf of the Government of India and Mr 
U Nyunt Swe, on behalf of the Government of Myanmar, in the 
presence of the Minister of State for Commerce, Mr Kamaluddin 
Ahmed. Mr G. Parthasarathy and Dr J.K. Bagchi, the Additional 
Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce, were also present at the 
signing ceremony, besides the eight-member delegation from 
Myanmar. The agreement will be valid for two years and will come 
into force from a date to be mutually agreed upon by the two 
sides. It provides for border trade to be conducted initially 
through the Customs posts across Moreh in Manipur and Champai in 
Mizoram corresponding to Tamu and Hri on the Myanmar side. Trade 
under the agreement may be in freely convertible currencies or 
in currencies mutually agreed upon by the two countries, 
including counter-trade arrangements. 
  Although in practice some form of border trade had been in 
operation, there had so far been no provision for formalised 
trade across the border with Myanmar. The agreement, which has 
been signed following approval given by the Cabinet in the 
recent past to the Commerce Ministry's proposal to formalise and 
facilitate border trade, will help in furthering the economic 
content in the relations between the two countries. It would 
also help in developing the infrastructure in the border States 
and increasing economic opportunities for people living there. 
The agreement will have to be followed by infrastructural 
arrangements required for the purpose, including the setting up 
of customary check-posts, banking facilities, etc.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--The summit-level dialogue 
between India and Singapore today yielded three important 
agreements on avoiding double taxation, shipping, and tourism, 
as official circles today described the visit of the Singapore 
Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, as one of "far-reaching 
significance." 
  The agreements apart, the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, and the visiting dignitary, are understood to have opened 
vistas of wide-ranging economic cooperation, and even discussed 
specific projects at their level at a one-to-one meeting, after 
which they led their respective delegations in a 90-minute 
dialogue. 
  The Singapore leader arrived here last evening on a 
week-long 
official visit and will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day 
function. He and Mrs Goh called on the President, Dr. Shankar 
Dayal Sharma, and Mrs. Vimala Sharma. 
  Mr. Goh's high-level delegation includes his Foreign 
Minister, Prof. S. Jayakumar, and the Minister for Trade and 
Industry, Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong, besides a host of senior 
officials, and 36 leading members of the Singapore business 
community. 
  The President hosted a lunch in honor of the visiting 
dignitary and it was attended by Mr. Rao and his Cabinet 
colleagues. At the end of the day, the spokesman of the External 
Affairs Ministry noted that the "atmospherics were excellent, 
and the talks substantive in content which went beyond 
expressions of goodwill." 
<H5>  Invitation to Rao </H5>
  He said the specific areas of cooperation were discussed at 
the level of the Prime Ministers. The Singapore leader is 
understood to have invited Mr. Rao to his country at the 
earliest opportunity. 
  While the two leaders discussed regional issues as well as 
the overall prospects for economic cooperation in their 
one-to-one interaction of just over half an hour, the thrust of 
the entire exercise today was undoubtedly economic. 
  Hosting a banquet for the visiting leader, Mr. Rao said 
India 
looked forward to a further expansion of relations with the 
ASEAN, with which it was a sectoral dialogue partner. Singapore 
is an ASEAN member. 
  Mr. Rao also noted that cooperation between India and 
Singapore could extend to third country projects and hoped that 
Mr. Goh's visit would provide a "timely and strong impetus." 
Singapore's resources of capital, technology, and managerial 
expertise could find excellent net- working with India's 
agricultural and mineral wealth, skilled manpower and markets, 
he said. 
  Tourism, housing, shipping, road-building and the setting up 
of corridors in India from which joint India-Singapore 
endeavours could thrust out to export markets, were understood 
to have been some of the concrete areas of discussion between 
the two countries today. 
  The suggestion here today was that in the area of tourism 
Singapore could act as a "funnel" for India, if the necessary 
infrastructure and facilities were available in this country. 
  In this context, it is understood, India could amend its 
laws 
to permit Singapore Airlines to operate at airports so far 
restricted to domestic air services. It is expected this would 
be to augment the tourist inflow. 
  Property development in the country with Singapore finance, 
and low-cost middle-class housing, and private road-building, in 
which Singapore is said to have considerable expertise, were 
also believed to be areas of active discussion. 
  The broad sense available here is that Singapore could 
become 
a routing point of economic inflow of diverse sources if the 
Governments of the two countries could reach effective mutual 
understanding. 
  In the discussion between the two Prime Ministers, the 
spokesman said, the Singapore leader suggested that the ambit of 
India's dialogue with the ASEAN could be expanded. For now India 
is a sectoral dialogue partner of the ASEAN. He also briefed Mr. 
Rao on the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) at Seattle. 
  Mr. Goh said he was gratified to note that India's "focus" 
was now "turning to the east," and it had integrated its economy 
with the world economy. 
<H5>  Dialogue with Pak. </H5>
  For his part, Mr. Rao told his guest that India was open for 
a dialogue with Pakistan and wanted good-neighbourly relations 
with that country. The Prime Minister referred to the Shimla 
agreement, and said India would like a dialogue with Pakistan to 
get under way under this agreement. 
  The two leaders also discussed the role of the major Asian 
economies, i.e., Japan, China and India, the spokesman noted. 
Developments within the APEC were also discussed. 
  At the corporate level, the spokesman said, a "strategic 
framework for cooperation" was signed between the Confederation 
of Indian Industry (CII) and Singapore Manufacturers' 
Association (SMA). 
  Mr. Goh is scheduled to meet the captains of Indian industry 
tomorrow. The Minister for Shipping and Surface Transport, Mr. 
Jagdish Tytler, and the Minister for Communications, Mr. Sukh 
Ram, are to call on the Singapore leader tomorrow. 
  The Singapore Prime Minister is due to visit Agra on January 
27, from where he is scheduled to go to Bangalore the next day 
to inaugurate a Technology Park set up in cooperation with his 
country. Before he flies out on January 30 from Bombay, Mr. Goh 
is to launch the office in that city of the Development Bank of 
Singapore.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 25--Singapore proposes to invest 
substantial amount of surplus capital in India, considered to be 
a prospective Asian mega-economy. As much as two to three per 
cent of Singapore's reserves are sought to be invested initially 
in developing infrastructure in the newly industrialised 
economies (NIEs) of the future, such as India. The amount could 
be raised to 35 per cent over the next decade. 
  This was stated here today by the Singapore Prime Minister, 
Mr. Goh Chok Tong, who called for the creation of a "Yin-Yang" 
or complementary relationship between the two countries. "Yin" 
and "Yang" are the two opposing and yet balancing elements in 
Chinese philosophy. 
  Addressing a meeting of Indian businessmen, organised by the 
Confederation of Indian Industry, he felt that the contrasting 
strengths of the two economies created an opportunity for a 
long-term strategic business alliance between the private 
sectors of the two countries. 
  Agreement signed: A strategic framework agreement 
was signed on the occasion between the Singapore Manufacturers' 
Association and the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) to 
promote trade, investment and economic cooperation between the 
industries of the two countries. 
  Mr. Tong told Indian businessmen at the meeting that the 
countries expected to become NIEs, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, 
over the next two decades are China, India and Vietnam. In case 
India's economic reforms quickened, it could become a 
mega-economy such as China and Japan. 
  While urging further opening up of the economy, especially 
in 
the banking sector, he felt that concessions extended to 
non-resident Indians should be available to other Singapore 
businessmen. "Singapore should be treated as an NRI (Nonresident 
Indian) country," he commented amidst laughter. 
  On reducing customs tariff, he said it would be welcome, but 
recognised the revenue implications involved for the Government 
of India. Similarly, the need for taking into account trade 
unions' views on the unemployment likely to be caused by the 
economic restructuring in India was also a knotty political 
issue, he conceded. 
  `India must go international': Replying to 
questions from Indian businessmen, Mr. Goh suggested that 
India's growth rate should be in the region of about six per 
cent per annum to take the two per cent population growth into 
account. This was the right time for India to "go 
international," he observed, as it had certain basic strengths 
in terms of an industrial base and pool of technically qualified 
manpower. 
  Mr. Goh highlighted the prospects of joint ventures between 
the two countries, especially in the ASEAN countries as well as 
China, Myanmar and Vietnam. Singapore could offer capital, 
management, access to technology and the market. "We can be your 
link to the Asia-Pacific," he said. 
  In this context, he mentioned the first major collaboration 
scheme, the $150 million Bangalore information technology park. 
This is an integrated project to develop offices, factories, 
houses and recreational facilities to be set up over a five-year 
period. It is a joint development programme involving a 
consortium of Singapore companies, Tatas and the Karnataka 
Government. 
  Mr. Goh said, "we are building an external wing to our 
economy, we are encouraging our businessmen to invest in the 
region." He pointed out that till now Singapore's reserves have 
been invested mainly in bonds, stocks and real estate in the 
developed countries. But it had now been decided to invest a 
portion of the country's reserves in stable, high growth 
developing countries of Asia. The investment would be directly 
in infrastructure projects, industries, hotels and tourist 
facilities as well as commercial properties. 
  `Open sky policy': Asked about the need for an 
"open sky policy" in India, he said the Indian Prime Minister 
had indicated interest in allowing the entry of Singapore 
International Airlines (SIA) to more destinations in this 
country. But the Civil Aviation Minister was more cautious in 
this regard, he said. 
  Mr. Goh maintained that SIA could bring tourists into the 
country in order to achieve India's target of increasing tourist 
arrivals from the present level of one million per annum to 
three to five million per annum over the next few years. He said 
it was Singapore's open sky policy which had improved tourism 
growth and also made SIA one of the best airlines in the world. 
  Regarding India's alignment with regional trading blocs, he 
felt that India should move eastwards while seeking to enter 
into any regional trade blocs. Conceding the problems faced by 
India in trying to align with the various regional blocs of the 
East as well as West, he expressed the view that European 
countries had a greater preoccupation with Eastern Europe at 
this stage.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 26--The visiting Singapore Prime 
Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, today expressed the view that the 
framework for a strategic economic alliance between his country 
and India had been created with his visit. 
  Talking to a small group of journalists this evening, Mr. 
Goh 
said the objective of his visit was to forge such a strategic 
economic alliance with India and he had found a responsive chord 
in the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao. 
  Terming his visit as timely, Mr. Goh said India till now was 
focusing more on the West and West Asia, and not much on Asia. 
At the same time, Singapore was looking to the West, as it had 
invested heavily in China and was looking for opportunities 
elsewhere. India had a big potential which was still unrealised 
and its trade and investment flows were minimal. Moreover, the 
potential for tourism was immense and India too was interested 
in exploiting this sector to earn more foreign exchange. 
Singapore could help in this, he said. 
  Kashmir issue: About the political discussions 
between him and Mr. Rao, Mr. Goh said both had provided an 
assessment of the situation in their respective areas. He had 
been briefed about the Kashmir situation, he said, but refused 
to comment about Pakistan's role in aiding and abetting 
terrorism there. "Singapore is a good friend of both India and 
Pakistan. So it will not be proper for me to comment during this 
visit, as it is a very complex issue." He said it was for India 
and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir problem. "Singapore has no 
role in it, nor do I see any role for any third party. It is 
essentially for India and Pakistan to resolve the issue." 
  To a question on the strident western campaign about alleged 
human rights abuses in Asian countries, Mr. Goh was categorical 
in rejecting the western concept of human rights. "Asian 
countries cannot be dictated by western standards. We should 
have our own concept of human rights since we have to feed our 
population, clothe them, educate them, house them. All this 
requires a stable law and order situation. Of course there 
should be some basic freedoms, but it should be appreciated that 
most of the Asian countries are in the first stage of 
development and that for many of them, the concept of democracy 
is new. Even the western countries had no human rights concept 
in their early stages of development and industrialisation. 
  Asked about India's role in the Association of South East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN), Mr. Goh reiterated that India should 
first develop its trade and investment relations with the 
Association. A sectoral dialogue with India had begun in this 
context and once trade and economic relations flourished, India 
could be given the status of a full sectoral partner, but not a 
member, he said. 
  On the future of the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (SAARC), Mr. Goh was not very optimistic, saying 
that it had no middle-income country as its member which could 
generate economic exchanges or capital flows. Moreover, some of 
the SAARC members had intractable problems between them and this 
would weigh down cooperation amongst them, he felt. "So I see 
slow progress for the SAARC, though I hope I am wrong in this 
assessment." 
  `Consensus emerging': Asked about his assessment 
on the economic reforms in India, Mr. Goh said that a consensus 
seemed to be emerging here on the need to de-regulate this 
economy and reform it. "I say this on the basis of my 
discussions with politicians and businessmen. Of course, I did 
not have any opportunity to discuss this with the Opposition 
parties here, but I feel a consensus is emerging." 
  On the new areas for reforms in India, Mr. Goh said he was 
looking for more liberalisation in the property laws.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of interview with Mr. Goh Chok Tong, Singapore </F>
Prime Minister, as reported by K.K. Katyal; date and place not 
given] 
  [Text] From a 75-minute intensive question-and-answer 
session with a small group of Indian journalists, the Singapore 
Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, emerged as a clear-headed 
leader. He did not hedge any query, whether palatable or 
otherwise. This is evident from the excerpts of the interview, 
as reported by K.K. Katyal. 
  [THE HINDU] A lot of expectations have been aroused by the 
planning of the visit to India. I do not know how you look at 
it. And how in your opinion, the economic relationship could be 
enhanced. So far the tendency in India is to look westward. Now 
it is to look eastward. The tendency in your case was to look 
eastward. I think you are looking westward now. Could you give 
us a general idea of what you expect of your visit? 
  [Goh] First, I look at the overall picture. Where India's 
position is, India stands the risk of being marginalised unless 
India opens up much more rapidly than it has done over the last 
two years. Europe would be looking more and more inwards. Its 
priority is to get the Single European Market going. Western 
Europe would also pay much more attention to Eastern Europe 
because these countries are neighbours. Western Europe would 
want to see that these countries progress so that they will not 
destabilise Europe. 
  In Asia, ASEAN and the East Asian countries are booming. We 
have formed APEC. The United States will remain engaged in this 
area. The United States itself is not just looking to Asia and 
Europe. It is also looking south to Mexico and Chile to AFTA 
[expansion not given]. So I ask myself, where does that leave 
India? I came to the conclusion that India would also come to 
the same conclusion. It must open up and decide how it wishes to 
integrate its economy. Would it want to integrate with the West 
or with Asia? Perhaps India should try and do both. In the past, 
India looked towards the former Soviet Union, and the West, but 
India would now see that East Asia would be booming away over 
the next 15-20 years. So I think India would also therefore want 
to look towards East Asia. Here I see the opportunity where 
Singapore can play a part. 
  [THE HINDU] But Mr. Prime Minister, this question may be put 
to you when you are there. We have already embarked on this 
process of liberalisation and you must have watched it. What are 
your impressions? You talked about opening up, but we are on the 
path. 
  [Goh] The results are actually remarkable. But they have 
been 
overshadowed by the great interest shown in China's more rapid 
growth. 
  [THE HINDU] By countries of East Asia? 
  [Goh] By the world. But if you examine the data for India, I 
would say they are remarkable. The growth, 1990-1991, was in the 
region of 1.4-1.5 per cent. After the opening up, it went up by 
more than three times to over 4 per cent per annum. Your foreign 
exchange reserves have gone up very rapidly. Foreign investments 
have flowed into India. Much slower compared to investments 
flowing into East Asia but, nevertheless, in terms of volume, 
much more than investments flowing into India over the last 40 
years. Inflation has been brought down. 
  [THE HINDU] Before your visit was finalised, at your 
National 
Day Rally in August, you spoke of generating "a mild India 
fever." Closer to your visit, in what form do you see that 
happening? 
  [Goh] I would want to excite Singapore investors in the 
potential of India. I would want to encourage Singapore 
investors to jointly invest with Indian businessmen in India, 
both for the domestic market, which is huge as well as for the 
export market. When Singapore investors go to India, I hope that 
they would make at least 25 per cent of their production for the 
export market. We also have interest in property development. 
But India, of course, has its own rules at the moment which will 
not allow foreign investors to buy land in India. I do not know 
whether there are possibilities over here. Singaporeans, by and 
large, are good in adding values to land, by putting up 
industrial facilities, hotels and residential properties. I 
would want to explore this area, to see how we can use our 
strength in property development in India. 
  [THE HINDU] When people talk about India and countries like 
Singapore going into India, they always compare India with 
China, Vietnam, Indonesia or even across the causeway to Johor. 
What do you think India has to do to generate the level of 
interest as, for example, China, Vietnam and Indonesia? 
  [Goh] India is a giant which has not realised its own 
potential. So India would have to be confident that it can 
compete internationally. India would have to face this challenge 
and just open up many sectors of its economy to competition, 
like what China has done. China, by welcoming foreign investors, 
has forced its state enterprises to be more competitive. India 
could, likewise, open up its internal economy to external 
competition and I believe India can compete. That confidence 
India must have in itself. This message, if it comes through 
strongly, will excite international interest. 
  [THE HINDU] Are there any specific problems that Singapore 
businessmen have as far as India is concerned? 
  [Goh] Until recently, India had not opened up. So it was 
very 
difficult for foreign investors, including Singapore 
businessmen, to invest in India. At the moment, there are some 
concerns over some bureaucratic rules which hamper investments. 
I think these are areas where one has got to learn to negotiate. 
These rules are becoming more transparent and simpler. 
  [THE HINDU] The information technology park project in 
Bangalore is encouraging (and sends) positive signals. By 
contrast, there is the Madras Corridor project, I do not know 
what stage it is in. What are the lessons to be learnt from the 
two experiences? 
  [Goh] The situation is different for both projects. 
Bangalore 
already has a core activity. When we showed interest in the 
industrial park in Bangalore, it was just adding on another 
layer to what had been going on. The Madras Corridor is 
something new. I would want to have more experience before we 
embark further into the Madras Corridor project. It is a huge 
project. We would not want to initiate an undertaking unless we 
are certain that success will come out of it. So it is on the 
back burner for the time being. 
  [THE HINDU] A question about APEC. This is the region that 
the Americas think is the fastest growing. Do you think that 
India can, at some stage, become a member or play a role as an 
associate member? 
  [Goh] The question would not arise over the next three 
years. 
APEC has decided not to consider new applicants for the next 
three years. Thereafter, it depends very much on India. If 
India's economy is more and more integrated with the Asian 
economy and it is also exporting to the United States and buying 
from the Americans, then India should certainly be considered as 
a potential member. If relations are quite limited, then it is 
an academic question. 
  [THE HINDU] Has there been a change in your perceptions of 
India politically and strategically, from the time you were 
Defence Minister to now? 
  [Goh] Yes. Partly because of India's stance on Cambodia and 
partly because of India's linkages with the former Soviet 
Union... I have to confess that I was a little worried reading 
reports of India's acquisition of a blue-water fleet, and 
reading the remarks by one of your generals who said that India 
intended to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa. Maybe 
this was just rhetoric of generals. But when these remarks 
appeared in cold print, you ask yourself, "What for?", "Why does 
India have to stretch its power from Singapore to Africa?" My 
perception has changed. As I got to understand India better, I 
saw that India has a legitimate interest to want to have a good 
navy to be able to defend its long coastline. Also, India is 
opening up and is not spending more on defence. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, in this region, Japan and 
China are major factors. Do not you think ASEAN and Singapore 
need to strengthen the dealings with India so as to restore the 
balance in the overall context, both in the security and the 
political context? Is there a case for that? 
  [Goh] Certainly. We see China emerging as a very strong 
economic giant in Asia. There is no reason why India should not 
develop also into a strong giant. When you have two friendly big 
economies in the area, it is going to benefit everybody. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, looking at South Asia, is 
there any cause for concern when there are tensions between 
India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or over this issue about NPT, 
etc? On these issues what are your views? 
  [Goh] We have some concern but they are not big concerns. 
Our 
linkages in terms of trade and investments are not on a large 
scale with that area. It does not really have too high an impact 
on our own economy. Politically, the Indians and Pakistanis in 
Singapore are now Singaporeans. They are much less affected by 
events in India and Pakistan. This would not have been so 30 
years ago when Indians and Pakistanis still felt they were part 
of India and Pakistan and they would be emotionally caught up. 
The key comes down to whether there are emotional links between 
the two countries. If there are strong links, when things go 
wrong in that part of the world, this would affect us. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, going back to APEC and 
ASEAN, 
one perception is that it should be restricted to cooperation 
for economic development among countries of this region. How do 
you envisage the relationship between ASEAN and APEC with other 
countries in this region? Do you think you are diluting by 
making APEC a superstructure and keeping some countries, like 
India, out of it? 
  [Goh] APEC will not be at the expense of ASEAN. ASEAN is an 
organisation for countries in the area and we will continue to 
explore ways to integrate our economies through the ASEAN Free 
Trade Area where tariffs are going to be lowered much faster and 
go down to lower levels. APEC enables ASEAN to reach out to 
countries with which we have strong links. It also enables us to 
get United States to remain constructively engaged in the area. 
They complement one another. 
  India is not kept out. India is not a member because its 
interests so far are different. When India begins to have more 
trade with APEC member countries, we would be very interested in 
bringing India to our forums. 
  [THE HINDU] Do you think over a period of time, the 
leadership will go to the hands of the United States? 
  [Goh] Of APEC? No, no. 
  [THE HINDU] Going back to China, Singapore is in a unique 
position to assess the evolution of modern China. How do you see 
China? Some see it as a benign military power. some see it as a 
growing economic power which would take on a forward posture in 
the world. How do you read what China is going to be? 
  [Goh] We take a realistic approach. We see both challenges 
and opportunities in China's growth. The opportunities are 
obvious. It is a huge market which offers us investments and 
trade. The challenges, of course, would be the nagging problem 
as to how a big economic power would behave in the future, 
whether it would translate into military power or political 
power, or a domineering China which wants to dictate other 
countries' behaviour. The practical approach is to get China 
constructively engaged in the political and economic processes 
of the region. In that way, China will understand better the 
aspirations and fears of its neighbours. Likewise, the 
neighbours of China would also understand better China's 
aspirations and problems. 
  [THE HINDU] It was in this context that I had asked earlier 
whether there is a merit in an enhanced relationship with India, 
so that it provides a balance vis-a-vis whatever China may be in 
the future. 
  [Goh] I would not want to go into this geopolitics of 
balance. I will just simply say that India is a giant with 
tremendous potential and if India realises its potential, that 
is going to bring benefits for countries in the region. If you 
set out to try and encourage India to balance China, you are 
creating a huge problem when there is not any. 
  If India becomes an economic giant, that is in our interest. 
Of course we want to engage India in such a way that when India 
acquires new weaponry, it will not cause its neighbours to be 
overly concerned. Because you are then meshed in with the 
economies and interests of your neighbours. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, ASEAN is a big success in 
the 
economic sense and perhaps in the security context also. SAARC 
has yet to take off. What are the reasons for these two 
developments? 
  [Goh] I have not done a deep study on SAARC so my 
observations may be superficial. I think first, the ASEAN has a 
longer history than SAARC. ASEAN is 27 years [old]. SAARC is 
only about seven years old. 
  Secondly, in ASEAN, we have a few middle-income countries. 
SAARC is still an association of rather poor members. 
  Thirdly, whilst several ASEAN countries have always been 
outward looking, the members in SAARC, have mainly been inward 
looking. In terms of economic strategy, India until recently has 
been inward looking. So has Pakistan been. With such an 
attitude, where is the scope for regional cooperation? In ASEAN, 
Malaysia, Singapore, and, to some extent, Thailand and 
Indonesia, have always been outward looking. So there are 
therefore benefits and compelling reasons for us to try and link 
our economies together so that we can reinforce each other and 
grow faster. Also we do not have intractable problems like some 
members of SAARC have. 
  [THE HINDU] Like between India and Pakistan. 
  [Goh] India and Pakistan. 
  [THE HINDU] A lot of countries like Singapore seem to have 
completely forgiven communist countries for their past, whereas 
they have not quite forgiven countries like India which were 
friendly with the Communist countries. It is like being more 
sinned against than sinning. 
  [Goh] Where do you get the perception from? 
  [THE HINDU] From talking to people here. 
  [Goh] I am very surprised. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, even in Japan for instance, 
they have not quite forgiven us for being friendly with Soviet 
Union at that time. And they still talk about expropriation or 
nationalisation which has not happened for 30 years. 
  [Goh] I think it could be a misconception. China is 
different. China is controlled by one party. If the party has 
decided to change course, the question we ask ourselves is who 
comes after Deng Xiaoping. Would the course be changed? And most 
of us have come to the conclusion that economic reforms in China 
would not be changed whoever is in charge in ten years' time. 
Therefore, there is confidence that the system will continue. 
For India, the democratic political processes can produce 
somebody who campaigns on the basis of nationalisation. And if 
that somebody wins, he is going to nationalise. So we ask 
ourselves the same question we are asking ourselves of China, 
would reforms in India stay on course. 
  [THE HINDU] What is your perception? 
  [Goh] If Prime Minister Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan 
Singh have another four or five years, it will stay on course. 
  [THE HINDU] Taking that argument further, would it be 
logical to say that in a situation like India--democracy is a 
liability for economic reforms? If there is a possibility of 
change in government then reforms cannot stay on course? 
  [Goh] It depends on the alternatives. If the alternative 
viewpoints espoused by the opposition parties are not very 
different from the present government, as far as reforms are 
concerned then there is no liability. The question is who can do 
the job better or faster. But if the opposition espouses another 
viewpoint, talk about nationalisation when they come into power. 
  [THE HINDU] Or anti multi-national... 
  [Goh] Or anti multi-nationals in this issue. And they look 
like coming to power, then of course, nobody is going to invest. 
It is not a liability or a strength. I think it depends on the 
reality of the situation. 
  [THE HINDU] There are some unflattering comments about the 
functioning of the democratic system here. What do you think 
about this? 
  [Goh] We always go by the market test. They can write what 
they want. But the point is national leaders and investors still 
seek to talk to us. 
  [THE HINDU] Mr. Prime Minister, if I have to ask a 
hypothetical question if you have to look at your crystal ball 
and make a prophecy--10 years from now, how do you see 
India-Singapore relations? 
  [Goh] Ten years from now, our trade will increase several 
fold. Singapore will have a bigger presence in India. Political 
relations will be much warmer and closer than today. And we will 
certainly see more Indian leaders visiting Singapore. 
  [THE HINDU] And more journalists.

  [Text] Bombay, Jan. 29 (PTI)--The Singapore Prime Minister, 
Mr Goh Chok Tong, today described India's economic policies as 
"a giant, which had remained within India" and during the last 
two years has been "allowed to roam freely in the world." 
  This move by the Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, would 
fetch India many friends, he said, adding that the "re-awakening 
and embarking on a new course" was a welcome move and had 
"stricken many Singapore businessmen with India fever." 
  Speaking at the India-Singapore Association luncheon meeting 
held in his honour, Mr Goh said his country also saw the need to 
invest outside. 
  "We looked towards opportunities emerging in Asia. While 
India looked towards west, we looked towards east to forge 
in-depth and lasting relationships." 
  He said relations between the two countries were never bad 
but they lacked warmth. This visit, he hoped, would now develop 
into an eternal friendship rather than in terms of dollars and 
cents." 
  Mr Goh, thanking the Indian Government for inviting him for 
the Republic Day celebrations, said his visit should augur well 
for both the countries and the setting up of an information 
technology park at Bangalore was an indication of his country's 
participation in India's growth.

<F P=106> [Article by Tapan Dasgupta: "Prime Minister Defends Mixed </F>
Economy Concept"] 
  [Text] Davos (Switzerland), Feb. 1--The Prime Minister, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, today defended the concept of mixed economy 
as in India. He told the global leaders of industry and finance 
that the collapse of communism and rejection of the command 
system did not necessarily mean total acceptance of market 
economy. 
  Urging the leaders for maintaining a balance between the 
two, 
he said, India followed the middle way or mixed economy which 
saved the country from "political submission and economic 
dependence." 
  Reacting to the criticism that the process of reforms has 
slowed down in the country, Mr Rao said that in the new-found 
enthusiasm for change, governments should not go overboard and 
plunge large chunks of their people into mass misery. 
  "They have no right to do so, the scheme of change must take 
full note of such contingencies and make allowance for them. 
  "Each society has to find its own "middle way" suited to its 
circumstances, but find it must, eventually and find it in the 
spirit of the new changes in the world, if it has to succeed," 
the Prime Minister said. 
  Mr Rao was addressing the closing plenary session on 
"Challenges before mankind as it enters 21st century," at the 
annual Davos symposium organised by the World Economic Forum 
(WEF). 
  According to Mr Rao's prognosis, poverty will continue to 
pose the most serious challenge to mankind during the greater 
part of the 21st century. The reasons furnished by him are that 
poverty is a breeding ground of disunity and tension. These 
tensions will dominate to such an extent that the governments 
will be unable to give first priority to eradication of poverty, 
but he is hopeful about the removal of illiteracy within the 
first quarter of the coming century or even earlier by 
harnessing some of the major technological developments relating 
to communications. 
  The Prime Minister's speech was also an implied criticism of 
the U.S. foreign policy and Pakistan's encouragement of 
terrorism in India. He said the end of the Cold War was welcome 
but it would not by itself usher in peace everywhere. While it 
would prevent world conflagration, it could also create 
conditions for the resolution of regional conflicts, "provided 
it fits into the global strategy of the wielders of real power. 
"The question is: Who will wield that real power?" he said. 
  Disagreeing with some thinkers that economic problems have 
now become solvable, Mr Rao said that the prospect of their 
being actually solved was nowhere in sight in the short run. On 
the other hand, the ethnic-cultural-religious problems would 
certainly threaten to get aggravated. "What seems likely is a 
further complication wherein economic, social and 
ethnic-cultural factors combine to compound the threat to the 
political unity and peace of states. 
  Obviously referring to the situation in Kashmir and Punjab, 
he said, "much of the fundamentalist fanaticism prevailing 
today, may, on a deeper analysis, be found to be traceable to 
causes very unrelated to religion." To discover and remove these 
causes would be the real challenge of the leaders of the world," 
since it may not always be possible to eradicate malaise by 
individual efforts in the affected countries separately," the 
Prime Minister said. 
  The Prime Minister, while criticising the fetters imposed by 
some western powers on technology imports by Third World 
countries, said those who invested in furthering the frontiers 
of science and technology would naturally like to be 
compensated. But, "when the price is paid, there should be no 
other extraneous and unreasonable restraints. In case of an 
unwarranted insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge 
will be to develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the 
national level." 
  The Prime Minister might have been referring to the case of 
importing cryogenic engines from Russia which was scuttled by 
the United States. 
  PTI and UNI adds: Mr Rao said that though politically 
motivated religious fanaticism had held complete sway in the 
past few years, "with diligent and patient work among people, 
their desire for socio-economic development has been made to 
prevail over false religious slogans and tactics." 
  Mr Rao who devoted most of his time in addressing the theme 
of the meeting, "Redefining changes in the global economy," 
recognised that there were costs inherent in the free exchange 
of knowledge and ideas. "Those who invest in furthering the 
frontiers of science and technology expect recompense," Mr Rao 
said adding that "we do not necessarily argue against that 
expectation but we believe that when the price is paid there 
should be no other extraneous and unreasonable restraints." 
  Mr Rao contended that in the event of unwarranted insistence 
on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to develop the 
necessary peaceful technologies at the national level, in an 
obvious reference to the withholding of cryogenic rocket 
technology to India. 
  The Prime Minister in a dig at copying western ideas said 
while they succeeded "by their arms in the past and technology 
in the present," others should adopt or adapt to the 
technologies as well as that is wise and humane in the West. 
[sentence as printed] "While doing so, we have to be securely 
anchored in our own tradition which is equally incisive, and 
much more relevant to our situation," he said. 
  Mr Rao also did not agree with those who feel that the 
rejection of the command economy ipso facto meant a 
total acceptance of what it had sought to replace. In India, he 
asserted, "we recognise the change, but maintain a balance which 
has come to be known as the middle way." 
  He pointed out, some feel that with the collapse of 
communist 
system and the world having become uni-polar there could be no 
middle-way, since the world has only one way now. This 
assertion, he said, was "unrealistic" from what has happened in 
the recent past. 
  The Prime Minister said that one should not accept a dogma 
even if it happens to be [the] only one in the field at a given 
moment. 
  While change had to be accepted as a result of deliberate 
and 
objective thinking, "at the same time, those who wear the shoe 
and know where it pinches should have full say in deciding how 
to mend it." As such, he said, their scheme of change must take 
full note of contingencies like mass poverty and make allowance 
for them. 
  The Prime Minister said while the remarkable advances in 
medicine, bio-technology, nuclear science and cybernetic 
promised to change human life beyond recognition, this should be 
so only if the new stimulus does not stop at the point of 
affordability. 
  In this context, Mr Rao said he found India and a few other 
developing countries more fortunately placed and said "we do not 
find serious difficulty in the flow or absorption of technology, 
except when our progress itself tends to create some uneasiness 
in some quarters." 
  Referring to the theme of the forum, Mr Rao called for new 
approaches and new programmes to solve the global problem of 
poverty and provision of basic needs to millions. 
  With growing integration, any thought of insulating any part 
of the world from the problems of other parts would be futile," 
Mr Rao warned. 
  He also called for harnessing technological developments in 
communications to banish illiteracy and suggested a healing 
relationship between the earth and human civilisation by 
removing the adverseal attitude towards nature. 
  Mr Rao cautioned the business people of globe that the 
fallout of mass misery would not affect specific groups, 
countries or regions only, but would engulf the whole world. 
  He said the end of Cold War would not usher in peace 
everywhere, though it could prevent major conflagration. 
  It could foster conditions for the resolution of regional 
conflicts, provided it fits into the global strategy of the 
wielders of real power--one or more it matters little and the 
question is, Mr Rao said, who would wield that real power. 
  In a clear rebuff to the developed western world, 
particularly the United States, the Prime Minister said no 
extraneous and unreasonable constraints and conditionalities 
should come in the way of technology transfer. 
  The Prime Minister declared that in case of an unwarranted 
insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to 
develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the national 
level. 
  In an obvious reference to the West and the insistence of 
the 
United States to link transfer of technology and aid to human 
rights, environment and exploitation of labour, the Prime 
Minister said: "We must seek to reaffirm, as a matter of high 
principle, the spirit of inquiry which was central to human 
progress." 
  Earlier, the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, said 
that no extraneous considerations such as human rights, 
environment and exploitation of labour should be allowed to 
interrupt free access of goods and services from developing 
countries to industrialised nations.

<F P=106> [Article by Tapan Dasgupta: "Prime Minister Invites More </F>
Foreign Investment"] 
  [Text] Zurich, Feb. 2--India was hailed as the latest 
"success story" at the Davos meet and was assured that the year 
1994 would be the India year. 
  The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who left here 
this 
morning for Bonn was highly satisfied with the response of 
international corporate leaders. Some of them called on him 
personally and told him that India was on their priority list 
for foreign direct investments. 
  The most noteworthy feature is that this change in 
perception 
about India among global business leaders has been brought about 
without the assurance of any further concessions. Both the Prime 
Minister and the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, who 
spearheaded the discussions on India made it clear that India 
would welcome investments, particularly in the infrastructural 
sector, but it must be on India's terms. 
  The Prime Minister elaborated this at the closing plenary 
session. Responding to Prof. Schwab, the founder of World 
Economic Forum (WEF), who welcomed Mr Rao as a "philosopher and 
statesman" and the man behind the process of transformation in 
India. He said he owed the success of reforms to Nehru who had 
introduced the concept of mixed economy. 
  He said the concept of market economy in the unipolar world 
was fast becoming a dogma but India would not accept a 
ready-made formula prescribed from thousand miles away. Reforms 
had to be a programme of change with the human face. The 
government had no right to throw out of job 10 million people 
because somebody suggested it. The obvious reference was to the 
developed world's prescription for restructuring the public 
sector through privatisation, without caring for the 
consequences. But the government had to take such a contingency 
into account and make full allowances before launching the 
scheme of change, Mr Rao explained. 
  The strategy of the Indian side in the panel discussion on 
India was to explain why foreign investors should invest India 
and leave it at that. Replying to a question on drug pricing, Mr 
Mukherjee said while the policy would be reviewed, the 
government would also have to keep in mind the objective of 
health policy. As for drug price equalisation scheme, he would 
not comment as the issue was subjudice. 
  Reacting to strong reservations on intellectual property 
rights expressed by FMC Corporation of the United States, Mr 
Mukherjee said India would go only to the extent of changing 
patent laws as committed under the GATT agreement. To a question 
if the government would change labour laws to promote foreign 
direct investment, Mr Mukherjee's reply was that in the Indian 
situation no unlimited power of hiring and firing could be given. 
  The Prime Minister who intervened towards the end, said that 
he came to Davos "with an infinitely deeper sense of confidence" 
than two years ago, about the course of reforms. The government 
was considering what more could be done. But no step could be 
taken without carefully assessing the possible results of such a 
step. "We do not want to jump and break our legs," he said. 
  A number of chief executives of global companies called on 
Mr 
Rao and told him that they would like to step up their 
investments in India. Among them was Mr Charles Cilmour, 
vice-chairman of Ford Motors, who said that India might be made 
a source for auto-parts and components to begin with to be 
followed by a production base for Ford trucks and cars. 
  Others who met Rao were Mr Kenneth Ley, chairman of Enron, 
Mr 
Hezeltor, chairman of Dow Corning, a U.S. glass company planning 
to invest in India, Mr Martin Liang of a large U.K.-based 
construction company interested in building roads, highways and 
hospitals, and Mr Charles Piggo of the U.S.-based Paccaor which 
is manufacturing heavy trucks, and drilling equipment. 
  The Prime Minister's growing confidence was evident in the 
manner in which he added a big rider to his overall statement 
that reforms would continue. "We shall not do what we do not 
consider necessary. We have to see the results and if more 
changes are needed, we shall not hesitate to reorient the 
policies," he said. 
  On the key question of foreign investment in India, Mr Rao 
said he was satisfied. But wanted more foreign investment in the 
infrastructure areas. The Prime Minister had clearly begun to 
pick and choose the kind of investments he would like in future. 
This was a privilege which he never enjoyed in the past two 
years or he could not do so for India had not till then become a 
credible option for foreign investors. 
  Delivering final address at the WEF annual meeting, Mr Rao 
reiterated that India wanted to pursue its own model of economic 
reforms, by striking a balance. "We do not like to follow 
policies framed two thousand miles away and dictated to us," he 
said. That was an assertion which Mr Rao never made in the past 
and is a result of a growing confidence in the economic reforms 
pursued by his government and the impact these have made on the 
people and foreign investors. 
  The new found confidence was also evident from the manner in 
which he strongly defended the bureaucracy against the charge 
that it was delaying implementation of economic reforms. His 
peremptory dismissal of a question on whether Hindu-Muslim 
tensions affected investment in India is a clear sign that Mr 
Rao will invite foreign investment, but without kneeling down or 
bowing to pressures of unreasonable demands. "We are a 
pluralistic society and Hindu and Muslims would continue to live 
together for years to come. If there are clashes, we should 
bother, not you," he snapped. 
  Even, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, showed such confidence while 
recounting the various economic reform measures taken by the 
government. "Our policy changes are not by accident. These began 
from the eighties and as such are based on the bedrock of 
experience," he said. But when it came to reforming the labour 
market or introducing an exit policy for workers, Mr Mukherjee 
firmly ruled it out on the ground that the government would like 
to stay away from the policy of hire and fire.

<F P=106> [Article by F.J. Khergamvala] </F>
  [Text] Manama (Bahrain), Jan. 25--On a day when the 
Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, was talking about 
jugular veins, iron curtains and preconditions, India's visiting 
Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, got 
emphatic support from two Gulf regimes for a strict bilateral 
approach to resolving the Kashmir dispute. 
  In Kuwait and in Bahrain where Mr. Bhatia met the top 
echelons of the leadership the hosts made two points, in 
addition to the routine but important message about the 
contribution of the Indian community to development in these 
places. One, that they are glad that talks between India and 
Pakistan have been resumed and next, that these must continue if 
a solution is to be found. 
  Noteworthy: Lest this sounds like a daily 
exhortation coming from one part of the world or the other to 
India and Pakistan, a specific nuance that injected itself into 
these views from top Gulf leaders is noteworthy, especially 
because this is the first time it has been made. In Kuwait, 
sources say the term avoidance of "internationalisation" of the 
resolution mechanism was used. However internationalised the 
dispute already is, this usage was music to Indian official 
ears, especially after unfounded rumours that Kuwait had joined 
Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and the United Arab Emirates in agreeing to 
sponsor a resolution against India on human rights violations. 
Officials from both sides declined to identify the specific 
Kuwait leader who used the term. The inference could be drawn 
that it was either the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jabir or the Crown 
Prince and Prime Minister, Sheikh Sa'd. 
  Bahrain chose to make the same point using another logic. 
Bahraini officials point to their own live dispute with Qatar 
over the ownership of some islands and the maritime boundary. 
Qatar has taken the dispute unilaterally to the International 
Court of Justice (ICJ) but Bahrain has challenged in the first 
instance, the right of Qatar to go to the ICJ unilaterally. The 
message conveyed to Mr. Bhatia was that only direct disputants 
can find the appropriate avenue to resolving a problem. It need 
hardly be emphasised that especially in this region the events 
surrounding the broader Arab-Israeli dispute are being shaped 
through direct bilateral channels between Israel on the one hand 
and the other Arab parties on the other. 
  Published announcement: It would be a mistake to 
interpret the stands of Kuwait and Bahrain as being supportive 
of India on Kashmir but India should be gratified that the 
approach advocated by it had found an echo and been explained 
through the logic of the circumstances in which these regimes 
find themselves and the broader trends in the region. Bahrain 
and Kuwait had one other stated and published announcement. This 
time for the ears of the Pakistan opposition leader, Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif, and the "Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir." Both of them 
have been shouting themselves hoarse about sanctions against 
India by the Gulf. On the day Mr. Bhatia arrived in Kuwait Mr. 
Sharif appealed to the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) 
to call for sanctions against India. 
  Two facts respond to these appeals. One, made in Kuwait and 
Bahrain about the contribution of the disciplined Indian 
community and, another in the 1993 annual trade figures just 
published by Bahrain. Imports from India increased by 20 percent 
to $87.5 millions and exports to India nearly doubled to $56 
millions. Pakistan bought only $8.5 millions worth of goods from 
Bahrain and does not figure on the list of major sources of 
exports. Also for Mr. Sharif's information is the fact that in 
Saudi Arabia the number of Indians working has jumped to a 
million. The Amir of Kuwait's visit to India is being scheduled. 
Iran's Speaker is to visit India. The Saudis have just nominated 
an Ambassador to India and positioned a military attache 
recently in New Delhi. 
  Investments: In comments to newspersons Mr. Bhatia 
by and large gave an economic-cum-investments spin to the 
"goodwill" visit. Considering that India does not even know 
about Kuwait's offset investments programme which could bring 
money into India, if there was one aspect that Mr. Bhatia did 
not discuss, it was investments. Both Gulf countries agreed to 
send chamber of commerce delegations, which is not saying very 
much. Bahrain also agreed to hold its joint committee meeting 
with India in four months. 
  Mr. Bhatia's mission, timed and designed to preempt Pakistan 
gaining an advantage in these countries seemed to suffer from an 
old rigid syndrome. Gulf countries have changed. There are 
consultative or elected assemblies. Though Mr. Bhatia did meet 
the rulers and other top leaders as well as the Speaker of the 
Kuwaiti Assembly, the effort next time should be on speaking to 
politicians on various Assembly committees. The one dominant 
issue in the assemblies is the subject of manpower imports and 
human rights in countries with Muslim minorities, both of very 
direct concern to India.

  [Text] London, Jan. 22 (PTI)--India has reportedly bought 
35 VT-72B armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs) based on the T-72 
main battle tank from Slovakia. 
  The $31.5 million deal is a first step towards meeting the 
Army's requirements for over 400 ARVs, the London-based JANE'S 
DEFENCE WEEKLY reports in its latest issue. 
  Ten of the 35 ARVs purchased for Rs. 28.9 million [rupees] 
each ($920,000) are being imported in completed form and the 
remainder in semi-knocked down kits for local assembly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Good Decision"] </F>
  [Text] According to a news report, a decision has been made 
to start building a nuclear power plant to meet the increasing 
demand for power in our country. Although the inappropriate 
attitude of the Western nations towards our peaceful nuclear 
program is given as the reason for this principled decision, 
however, we believe that our policy-makers should continue to 
build the nuclear power plant on our own despite the support 
offered by other countries. The few nations that have attained 
nuclear capability cannot be trusted. The moral perversion these 
countries have demonstrated in order to deprive the third world 
of cheap modern technology need not be mentioned here. Their 
treatment of Muslim countries is openly prejudiced. Therefore, 
we should not trust these countries in any situation. The 
irreparable loss we have suffered in the area of peaceful use of 
nuclear technology was caused mainly by the unfair attitude of 
the Western nations, however, our governments' ambiguous 
policies also played a role in it. Had our policy-makers started 
to attain nuclear technology when France and Canada had refused 
to cooperate with us, we would not be facing this energy crisis 
now. This energy shortage has all but stopped our developmental 
projects.

<F P=106> [Article by Qilandar Momind: "Tribals to Merge into Nation's </F>
Mainstream"] 
  [Text] Federal Home Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Nasirullah 
Babar said after a press conference in Islamabad, in formal 
talks with reporters, that the federal government has decided to 
establish voting right for adults in tribal areas. 
  During the last general election and afterwards, the 
organization and almost all the national political parties 
related to tribal areas demanded voting rights in the tribal 
areas. The parties involved in the present government have also 
included plans for voting in the tribal areas in their election 
manifestos. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, during her visit to 
the Kurram Agency, announced loudly that elections would soon be 
held with voting rights for adults in tribal areas. Major 
General Nasirullah Babar, federal home minister, may be talking 
informally; however, Madam Benazir Bhutto's declaration is a 
very welcome step. It will be remembered in the political 
history of this nation. As a result of the implementation of 
this plan, hundreds of thousands of tribal people who have been 
deprived of their right to vote will get this right. Major 
General Nasirullah Babar wants amendments to several laws in 
order to attain this goal. Therefore, it will take some time to 
implement this plan. Once this decision has been made, however, 
we can expect that, Allah willing, all tribal adults will be 
able to cast votes in the next general election. The federal 
home minister also revealed that in light of this decision, the 
government has told the election commission to prepare new 
election lists for the tribal area during the next census. The 
people in the tribal areas will vote according to this list in 
the next election. Similarly, it is the duty of the tribal 
leaders and the people there to encourage the tribals to join 
the national campaign, and to start a campaign for this in order 
to prepare them to make the election lists. The federal home 
minister also revealed during his talks that the FATA [Federally 
Administered Territories] members support voting rights. The 
main reason for the tribal people not having any right to vote 
was that the Parliament members from tribal areas were not in 
support of this kind of election. Now, with the grace of God, 
the situation has changed, and the Parliament members from 
tribal areas, perhaps for the first time, support the right to 
vote for tribal people. It is expected that the people in the 
tribal areas will have the rights for which the educated people 
in the tribal areas have fought for a long time. As a result, 
the areas included in FATA will become part of Pakistan's 
political structure. All the laws of the country used in the 
other states will be imposed in the FATA region also. Along with 
FATA, the PATA [Politically Administered Territories] region 
will also be included in the political structure. Thus, the 
political boundaries of the tribal areas will merge with the 
boundaries of our nation and fulfill the dreams of Khushal Khan 
Khatak and Ilama Iqbal.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Danger of Bloody Revolution"] </F>
  [Text] The situation in Sarhad [NWFP] is deteriorating 
rapidly. The danger of armed fighting and bloodshed between 
government supporters and the opposition is increasing. 
Patriotic circles are very concerned about this situation. This 
kind of tug-of-war for power in a democratic parliamentary 
system is deplorable. What will be the result of all this? 
Professor Ghafur Ahmed, the vice chairperson of Jamaat-i Islami 
Pakistan, has expressed serious concern about the deteriorating 
political situation and the fighting in Sarhad, saying that this 
time, there will be no martial law, but a bloody revolution. 
While addressing a crowded press conference in Azad Kashmir's 
capital of Muzaffarabad, he said, "It is the opposition's 
constitutional right to introduce a no-confidence motion; 
however, horse-trading is not a constitutional right." Professor 
Ahmed warned that if, by ending the government in Sarhad, bricks 
from the wall of democracy are removed, then the wall would 
crumble and fall right on Benazir Bhutto, and democracy would be 
endangered. Professor Ghafur Ahmed also criticized opposition 
leader Nawaz Sharif, saying that the action of the opposition 
leader was not laudable, and that he opposes for the sake of 
opposing. Professor Ghafur Ahmed is considered one of the most 
serious and far-sighted political leaders in the nation. He 
warned the government and the opposition at the right time and 
appropriately. We cannot praise all the actions that Sahibzada 
Sabir Shah's government in Sarhad has done. He made some 
mistakes that the opposition should have identified. In a 
democratic parliamentary system, the purpose of the opposition 
is to identify the government's mistakes and suggest ways to 
improve the situation. Instead of following this positive 
democratic process, though, efforts are being made to remove 
Sabir Shah's government and, in order to make the no-confidence 
campaign against him successful, they have started 
horse-trading. Since the PPP has governments in the two largest 
states of the country and at the Center and the president also 
belongs to this party, it is commonly believed that Madam 
Benazir Bhutto is doing all this to establish her own party's 
government in the remaining two states.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan 'Allam: "40 Million AIDS Cases by the Year </F>
2000! Sharp Dispute Among Clergy Over Sick Mothers' Abortions'] 
  [Excerpts] According to the World Health Organization's 
[WHO] figures, the number of AIDS cases is rising constantly, 
and in just six years, that is, in the year 2000, the number of 
those infected with the virus will reach approximately 40 
million, with 90 percent of these cases in the developing world! 
  In the face of these dreadful figures, the Islamic Medical 
Sciences Organization organized its sixth juristic symposium, 
entitled "An Islamic View of the Social Problems of AIDS." It 
was held in Kuwait and attended by representatives of 35 
countries of the world, among them Egypt, which sent a medical 
delegation headed by the Minister of Health and a number of 
Muslim ulema, led by His Excellency the Mufti of the Republic. 
They discussed extremely sensitive topics and issues, such as: 
  The isolation of AIDS patients; the position on someone who 
spreads the virus intentionally; the rights and duties of an 
infected husband; the admissiblity of performing an abortion on 
an infected mother; the extent of her nursing and breastfeeding 
her healthy child; the right of a healthy spouse to seek 
separation from an infected spouse; the nature of the marital 
intimacy under these circumstances; and whether AIDS may be 
considered a fatal disease. 
  The conference spent three days in study and lively 
discussions, and ended its closing session with a number of 
important proposals and recommendations. 
  At the beginning of this symposium, which is the Islamic 
Medical Sciences Organization's first since the liberation of 
Kuwait, and held in cooperation with the Kuwaiti Ministry of 
Health, the Academy of Islamic Jurisprudence in Jeddah, and the 
regional office of the WHO in Alexandria. One hundred and thirty 
medical and Islamic figures representing 35 Islamic and 
non-Muslim countries set out, at the outset, the global AIDS 
situation with the last WHO reports prepared by Dr. Muhammad 
Hilmi Wahdan, WHO's Director of Disease Prevention and 
Treatment, followed by Dr. Muhammad Haytham al-Khayyat: 
  In the space of just a decade, AIDS has become an epidemic 
affecting millions of men, women, and children on every 
continent. Despite the early cases that appeared among 
"sodomite" men in several industrialized countries, it has since 
then become a wide-ranging plague. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Disaster of the Developing Countries </H5>
  It is indeed strange that approximately 90 percent of 
expected AIDS cases are in the developing countries. The 
situation is critical in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, where 
the number of adults infected with the virus exceeds seven 
million. About a third of pregnant women who have visited 
pregnancy clinics in the cities are infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus. As a result, WHO now expects that by the 
year 2000, between 5 and 10 million HIV-infected children will 
have been born; by the mid-1990s--about one year from now--the 
anticipated increase in juvenile AIDS deaths will be equal to 
the decrease in deaths achieved by the Save the Children program 
over the last two decades! 
  The average life expectancy at birth in these African 
countries before the spread of the AIDS virus rose 20 percent, 
but it will actually drop 5 to 10 percent by 2000, instead of 
rising, had it not been for the AIDS virus. 
  Egypt participated in this symposium with a high-ranking 
medical delegation led by Minister of Heath Dr. 'Ali 
'Abd-al-Fattah al-Makhzanji and a host of Egypt's medical 
notables: Dr. Ibrahim Badran; professor of pediatrics Dr. Ahmad 
Mustafa 'Isa; dean of medicine at 'Ayn Shams University Dr. 
Salah 'Id; Dr. Hasan Hathut, a native of Egypt who held the 
highest post in the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health; Dr. Hamid 
Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn Shams; Dr. Usamah 
Ruslan, secretary general of the Egyptian Doctors' Syndicate; 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-al-Fattuh; and the "dynamo" of the 
conference, Professor Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, the second man 
in the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization serving as 
assistant secretary general after Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-'Awadi, the secretary general and former Kuwaiti minister of 
health and planning. 
  A number of senior Muslim ulema from Egypt also took part in 
this juristic and medical symposium, most prominently His 
Excellency the Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid 
Tantawi, Muslim preacher, Dr. Yusuf al-Qardawi, and rector of 
al-Azhar University Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh. 
<H5>  Islamic Medical Cooperation </H5>
  The fact is that the scientific, medical, and Islamic 
interaction was clear during the symposium's heated debates. The 
topics were not the traditional ones, as is the case in many 
conferences. Specific topics were brought up, relating to AIDS 
victims, which required decisive judgements from the ulema, 
researchers, and physicians taking part, on every case 
separately. Among the cases upon which judgements were made, 
were the ruling on isolating AIDS patients; on the intentional 
transmission of the virus; the rights and duties of an 
AIDS-infected spouse; performing abortion on an AIDS-infected 
mother; the admissibility of an infected mother nursing her 
healthy baby; the right of a healthy spouse to request 
separation from an infected partner; and the right of marital 
intimacy. These are all, as we can see, thorny and sensitive 
issues many ulema would hesitate to approach, but in this 
instance they talked with frankness and clarity, on the basis 
that there is no shame in science and religion. 
  They discussed the issue of isolating AIDS patients, and the 
senior physicians participating said that the AIDS virus is not 
transmitted through cohabitation, touch, breathing, through 
insects, sharing food, drink, toilet facilities, swimming pools 
or chairs, nor even through sharing eating utensils, or other 
aspects of living together in normal daily life. The virus is 
transmitted, however, chiefly through sexual contact of any 
kind, the transfusion of contaminated blood or its derivatives, 
the use of contaminated needles, especially among drug users, or 
transmission from an infected mother to her child. 
  In accordance with all this, the ulema in the symposium 
resolved that there was no justification for isolating infected 
pupils, workers, or others from their healthy colleagues. 
  The symposium dealt with the issue of intentional 
transmission of the AIDS virus to healthy persons by any means, 
which the ulema viewed as forbidden and as gravely sinful and 
criminal, requiring temporal punishment. This punishment should 
vary to suit the degree of seriousness of the deed and its 
effect on individuals and society. 
<H5>  Combatting Those Spreading the Virus Intentionally </H5>
  The purpose of those intentionally spreading this deadly 
disease in society, and this deed, is a type of war and 
corruption on earth; one of the punishments stipulated for it in 
the [Koranic] Verse of the al-Harabah--if the purpose in 
intentionally spreading the virus is harm to a specific person, 
and the virus actually is transmitted, and leads to the death of 
the one to whom it was transmitted--would be retaliatory death, 
or execution. 
  If the purpose in intentionally spreading the virus is to 
harm a specific person, but the virus is not transmitted to him, 
then the perpetrator must receive a restraining punishment. 
  The symposium also touched on the issue of abortion for an 
AIDS-infected mother. On this issue there was a clear difference 
among the ulema, but they cited a judgement reached by the 
Islamic Medical Sciences Organization in a previous conference 
on Childbearing in Islam, which ruled on abortion that the fetus 
is alive from the beginning of conception, and that its life is 
inviolable at all stages, and that there could be no harm 
inflicted on it by abortion except in cases of extreme medical 
need. Some participants, however, sharply disagreed with this 
judgement, saying that abortion is permissible before the 
fortieth day of pregnancy, especially when there are good 
reasons. 
  Participating members of the symposium discussed the issue 
of 
AIDS-infected mothers nursing their healthy babies, citing the 
views of pediatrics professors, among whom, as we have 
mentioned, from Egypt, Dr. Ahmad Mustafa 'Issa, professor of 
pediatrics and president of the Egyptian Friends of Mothers' 
Milk Society, Dr. Hamid Shatlah, professor of pediatrics at 'Ayn 
Shams, pointed out that according to current medical data there 
is no certain danger in an AIDS-infected mother nursing her 
healthy baby. This is an instance of normal cohabitative 
intercourse. The view of the ulema in this symposium, based on 
this data, is that in Islamic law there is no impediment to the 
mother's nursing. 
<H5>  Prevention for Child of an Infected Mother </H5>
  While the likelihood of a healthy child being infected by 
his 
AIDS-infected mother through breastfeeding is extremely rare, 
when it has been found to be the case, it was due to the 
presence of the virus in the mother's milk or the mother's 
blood, transmitted to the baby's mouth due to a crack in the 
nipple. The mother may breastfeed for its many benefits, and she 
must take care to reduce the likelihood of infecting her nursing 
child. She may refrain from breastfeeding if she can find a wet 
nurse to suckle it, or to give him alternatives to mother's milk 
to nourish him. 
  They discussed the right of a healthy spouse to request a 
separation from an AIDS-infected partner, and concluded that 
either spouse may request a separation from an AIDS-infected 
partner, as it is an illness whose virus is transmitted chiefly 
through sexual contact. 
  The topic of this unique symposium, held in Kuwait under the 
sponsorship of His Royal Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad 
al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait was the clarification of the rules 
of Islam on the effects of the spread of AIDS, and so the ulema 
and physicians found no embarrassment in discussing a sensitive 
topic, which was the right of marital intimacy in cases of AIDS 
infection. They concluded that if either partner were to be 
infected with this disease, then the uninfected partner may 
refrain from marital intimacy, because sexual contact is the 
major mode of transmitting the virus. 
  If the healthy partner wishes to have sexual intimacy, then 
prudence requires him to use a condom, which reduces the 
likelihood of the virus and pregnancy, if he knows how to use it 
properly. 
  The members of the symposium did not consider AIDS to be a 
fatal disease, until its symptoms appeared fully, and the 
patient was no longer able to pursue a normal life, and died. 
<H5>  Ten Years of AIDS </H5>
  Addressing the importance of this symposium, and the Islamic 
view of the social problems of AIDS, Egyptian scientist Prof. 
Dr. Ahmad Raja'i al-Jundi, assistant secretary general of the 
Islamic Medical Sciences Organization spoke to AKHIR SA'AH. He 
said: 
  "For 10 years the world has been devastated by this plague 
of 
our time, whose like the world has not yet seen. Before this 
sickness research is helpless to offer treatment, with those 
infected condemned to death, even though that may be after some 
time. This great threat to humanity confirms the words of the 
Prophet: 
  "`If fornication spreads among a people, and they flaunt it, 
pains and illnesses that they never had before will appear on 
them.' If we consider this saying of the Prophet, we see that it 
speaks of fornication and the flaunting of it. 
  "Now, with a passing glance, we find that the Western and 
Eastern worlds take pride in the absolute freedom which has 
given people sexual freedom so that they are more like animals 
than people, to the point that in the last conference on human 
rights, one of the points of conflict between the advanced 
countries and the Islamic group was complete, unrestricted 
freedom, including sexual freedom, in which they take pride, 
disdaining our Muslim countries. And now they are reaping what 
they have sown, with this calamitous plague sweeping the world, 
which may annihilate it if science does not find decisive 
solutions to this problem in the very near future. 
  "The poor countries of Africa, and those of East Asia, are 
today seeing some villages being wiped out of existence by this 
dangerous disease. One of the common sights now is to see whole 
villages whose young people are gone, those who would been 
producing or working, while the overwhelming majority still 
alive are old men and children! 
  "Fortunately, in our Islamic region the effects of the virus 
are still under control, and far less than in other, Western 
countries. Perhaps the most important difference between us is 
our adherence to the teachings of Islam. Virtue and chastity 
still have their place among Muslim peoples; right and wrong 
have their roots in our peoples' consciences. Adultery is still 
a major crime in our societies. We must commit ourselves even 
more to the Koranic verse, `Approach not adultery; it is an 
abomination and an evil path.'" 
<H5>  Protection from Vice </H5>
  "If we consider this verse carefully, we see that the ban on 
adultery came with a warning not to approach it; approaching it 
means the ways leading to it, whether by way of the woman taking 
the steps necessary to protect herself by wearing modest Islamic 
clothing, and saving her adornments for her husband; or with men 
avoiding temptation, so that Satan will not seduce him into vice. 
  "The Prophet, God's peace and blessings be upon him, said, 
`O 
community of young men, let those of you who can provide, get 
married, and let those who cannot, fast and abstain.' Thus we 
are all asked to facilitate marriage for the young, to safeguard 
the resources of the Islamic community from being lost, for the 
young are the pillar of the community. 
  "It is not, however, merely a question of marriage. How many 
married men and women do we see betraying the vows they made to 
God? So the important thing, the more serious thing, is to raise 
our youth and the new generation in a purely Islamic way, for 
God's sake. They should know the limits God has set, and have 
certain knowledge that God is watching them, and that He knows 
what the eyes betray, and what is hidden in their hearts. They 
must learn to judge themselves before others judge them. If we 
can plant these virtues in them, we can guarantee them a safe, 
serene, secure life, no matter what modern challenges face them, 
sexual or non-sexual. 
  "It is expected that by the year 2000 the number of AIDS 
cases will grow to 40 million, and this staggering number will 
cause a great many social problems. There are many groups, 
including AIDS groups, which have been able, through their 
political influence, to politicize the disease. Perhaps most of 
these are in America, England, and France; they do not hide 
their infection with AIDS, but help to spread it in order to 
reap many political and social gains. There are human rights 
groups that sympathize with these infected people, and there are 
groups of scientists interested in ethics who have all used 
their own reasoning, and made legislation, and given the sick 
and the infected many, many rights, at the expense of the 
well-being of their societies. 
  "All this omits the Islamic view, with individual reasoning 
to fill the need of the Islamic community, which is `the best 
community raised up for mankind.' It is the first to lead with 
legislation, and the reasoning of its ulema and jurists is from 
known sources, which does not bring evil upon itself, from the 
holy Koran and the traditions of the Prophet. This is the main 
motive behind the holding of this symposium, "An Islamic View of 
the Social Problems of AIDS," under the sponsorship of His 
Highness the Amir of Kuwait, and the participation of men 
learned in Islamic jurisprudence, and the medical, social, and 
legal sciences from more than 35 Islamic and non-Islamic 
countries." 
<H5>  Declaration of Conference Resolutions </H5>
  In the closing session held in the Islamic Medical Center in 
the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, its secretary 
general, Professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Abdallah al-'Awadi, 
announced the resolutions of this important conference: 

  -  It is the right of a person infected with the AIDS virus 
to obtain the treatment and health care required by his health 
condition, regardless of how he became infected with the virus. 
He must inform his doctor and the competent authorities of his 
infection, as a precaution against transmitting the virus to 
others. The doctor must treat him and take precautions against 
being infected himself; he must make the AIDS patient aware of 
ways of keeping his health from deteriorating, and keeping the 
virus from others. He must not be oppressed, slandered, or 
abandoned because of his illness. 
  -  To protect youth from sexual perversion, early marriage must 
be 
encouraged, and the obstacles to it, which cause the age of 
marriage to be delayed, should be removed. 
  -  It is the duty of official and popular bodies to take action 
to 
make members of society aware of the danger of AIDS, the ways in 
which the virus is spread, and methods of prevention--especially 
abstinence and an adherence to virtue. 
  -  Islamic precepts must be made part of the school curriculum 
at 
all educational levels, to complement the other subjects in 
building character, for the good of individuals and society, and 
to ensure the prevention of this plague. 
  -  The media has a significant role in making the public aware 
of 
the dangers of AIDS, and methods of preventing it, especially in 
promoting abstinence. The media must also avoid showing anything 
that might inflame the passions or sinful temptations. 
  -  Official agencies must offer the facilities needed to 
diagnose 
the AIDS infection on a widespread basis, as early detection has 
a real effect on preventing the spread of the disease. 
  -  This conference calls upon all religious and rational people 
throughout the world to join their ranks and efforts with 
Muslims in their call for abstinence, and combatting all means 
of sexual contact outside legal marriage.

DFLP Member Kindles Political Dispute, Could Lead to Worse"] 
  [Text] Escalation between the Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah, continued on 24 February to an 
extent that threatens continuation of the alliance that exists 
between the two groups, within the framework of the alliance of 
Palestinian forces opposed to the self-government agreement 
between Israel and the PLO. 
  Perhaps the most prominent development, which appeared on 24 
February, was Hamas' admission of responsibility by its military 
wing--the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions--for the murder of 
DFLP member Yusuf 'Abu-Lafi on 15 February. The secretary 
general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqqaqi, 
told AL-HAYAH that this development "could negatively influence 
the alliance's continuation." He added: "Continued escalation 
between the two groups could affect the alliance but will not 
destroy it. As for the matter of killing Abu-Lafi, that is most 
serious. Therefore, we have agreed that it is a private matter 
among ourselves." 
  The case of Abu-Lafi's murder, after having been abducted 
for 
three days, increased tension at the meeting of the 10 factions' 
leaders at the beginning of this week, although Hamas did not 
claim responsibility for the murder during that meeting. It 
asked that it be referred to the leadership to make a final 
decision. However, the DFLP stated that Hamas was responsible, 
pointing out that the posters hanging in the streets of Khan 
Yunis were signed by Hamas. This led to tension in the meeting, 
and a committee was formed, chaired by Talal Naji, a leader of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command [PFLP-GC] (led by Ahmad Jibril). Each faction is to 
submit an official report, in which it will clearly state its 
views. An internal memorandum will be issued with the 
investigation's results. 
  Hamas' representative in Damascus, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, 
confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas was responsible for Abu-Lafi's 
death, "because he was an agent of the Israeli occupation 
forces. He was killed after his dealings with them were 
confirmed." He stated that he had personally given Mr. Naji a 
detailed report "exposing Abu-Lafi's activities. A video 
cassette accompanied the report with pictures confirming our 
opinion, stressing that he deserved to die." 
  DFLP sources, for their part, told AL-HAYAH that "Abu-Lafi's 
blood will not be shed in vain. The hands of Red Star battalions 
(the front's military wing) will reach out for those who 
committed this crime." The sources stated: "Abu-Lafi was a noble 
fighter. Representatives from the National Action Committee and 
prominent national figures, except for Hamas representatives, 
participated in his funeral." 
  The sources added: "No one has the right to judge people." 
Abu-Muhammad Mustafa replied vehemently to the accusations that 
Hamas bears responsibility for hindering the course of the 
alliance. He stressed to AL-HAYAH that the movement was not 
backing away from the step it had taken. The first step back 
must be taken by them (the DFLP)." 
  Mustafa added that Hamas refuses to enter a unified slate 
with the DFLP in future professional and medical elections, 
"because of obstacles that would prevent that. First, there is 
the mistrust between the factions in the occupied territories, 
as a result of the DFLP's claiming credit for four military 
operations that we carried out, and their demands for more seats 
than the votes they won." He pointed out that, in the Engineers 
Union elections in the Gaza Strip, the DFLP demanded more votes 
than they had, and made that a condition before entering a 
unified slate with Hamas. "We refused to give them more than 
they won. For their part, they refused to enter any future 
slate. They lost and did not win any seats; we won six seats." 
  The Hamas representative in Damascus added that this matter 
was nearly repeated in the Doctors' Union elections. "Certain 
DFLP and PFLP cadres voted for Fatah, rejecting the alliance 
with us. Some others were reluctant, and some were lightweights. 
As a result, we entered with the Islamic Jihad in a bloc. The 
PFLP and the DFLP were in a bloc, and Fatah was allied with 
independents. 'Arafat's group won 11 seats, and we lost." 
  Abu-Muhammad indicated that the DFLP and the PFLP had 
demanded more than their share. "The proof is that they won only 
13 percent of the vote compared to our 33 percent. Furthermore, 
the largest number of votes went to Muhammad al-'Akluk, Hamas' 
candidate, who won 370 votes, compared to 157 votes for the PFLP 
candidate, Rabbah Mahna'. The two fronts bear responsibility for 
giving in to Fatah because of factionalism. This is one of the 
reasons for the mistrust." 
  Regarding the DFLP's accusing Hamas of fationalism for not 
joining with it in a single slate in the Islamic University 
elections, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa stressed that "there was no 
reason for us to join in a unified slate, because it was 
completely decided for us, just like their position in Bayt 
Sahur (Gaza) in the Orthodox Club. Consequently, any success for 
us or for them was success for the alliance. There was no reason 
for us to be on a single slate." 
  Regarding the question of forming the National and Islamic 
Command for the Intifadah, Abu-Muhammad stated that Hamas 
rejects forming this command at the present time. He said: "To 
form a command like this, everyone must be equal in effective 
military action at home. However, Hamas carries out all the 
military action and bears all the daily consequences alone. 
Forming a command will never suit us, so long as our 
demand--that the standing in the alliance and command be in 
comparison to the size of each faction and its weight--is 
rejected. There must be equality in military fighting, so that 
our doubts are not confirmed that they want to profit from our 
efforts, Hamas' efforts." He indicated that there was the 
possibility of continuing present coordination on the political 
level, since political action was different from military and 
security action, and because "forming the unified command would 
threaten our security. It would be easy to strike at us, 
especially after a security agreement is signed between the PLO 
and Israel." 
  In response to the DFLP's charge that Hamas is the faction 
that is backing away from the alliance, Abu-Muhammad said: "They 
are the ones who began to back away. When we agreed to form a 
national, Islamic alliance, they backed away from it, deleting 
the word `Islamic.' When they were asked for the reason, they 
said that this was their right." He added that the second 
retreat was when they did not commit themselves to the 
alliance's political program agreed to on 9 October 1993. He 
said that "so long as they have not committed themselves to 
everything, it is our right not to be obligated when we believe 
that our interests would be damaged, because they want to hide 
behind Hamas. They don't want confrontation. This is another 
indication of mistrust." 
  With regard to the charge that Hamas has backed away from 
holding popular conferences, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa said: "We have 
not backed away from this, not for a moment. We understand the 
conferences to be political mobilization and instigation and 
nothing more. If they want elections, then let the DFLP and the 
PFLP be wherever possible in Syria and Lebanon."

<F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Command Decision in PFLP; Will </F>
Move Home in 1998"] 
  [Text] One of the questions that received different 
responses after President Hafiz al-Asad's meeting with Bill 
Clinton in Geneva last month is the fate of the 10 Palestinian 
factions that make Damascus their headquarters and the effect of 
that meeting on those factions' presence in the Syrian capital, 
especially since they oppose the Gaza-Jericho Agreement between 
Israel and the PLO. That agreement is supported by the American 
administration, which has put its weight behind it, considering 
it a "first step" toward a resolution of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
  Since the middle of last month, reports have circulated 
about 
the possibility of these organizations moving from Damascus to 
countries like Sudan or Iraq after the cordon nations are closer 
to agreement with Israel. Analysts see a connection between 
Syrian-Israeli progress, and those factions' effectiveness 
against the agreement and the peace process, in light of 
President Clinton's announcement that the summit talks had 
touched on the matter of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, and 
the rest of the opposition forces located in Syria, such as the 
PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP], led by George Habash and Nayif Hawatimah. 
  High-level PFLP sources report its firm intention to move 
gradually from Damascus into the occupied territories, and that 
it strongly rejects any possibility of moving to any other Arab 
or regional capital, such as Baghdad or Tehran. 
  These sources added that leaders in the Front see factors 
that will require moving the command decision from abroad into 
the territories. "That is because the Gaza-Jericho Agreement 
will be applied in the occupied territories and our opposition 
to it will be there. What is meant by gradual steps is that we 
need some time to establish this. All the Front's weight and the 
decision-making center will be in the territories by the Sixth 
Conference in 1998. However, now, we are still balancing matters 
between the two areas, so that we can ensure participation 
abroad with those who are in fact located at home." 
  These high-placed sources see a connection between 
implementing the Oslo Agreement and a mechanism for the Front's 
action at home, which could lead to "radical changes in methods, 
since we are working in two directions. In any event, the work 
will remain directed against the Israelis." In the first 
direction, the Front's mission is to escalate military action 
and "violence" against the Israeli forces remaining in the 
occupied territories, because what will happen is re-deployment 
and not withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. At the same time, PFLP 
cadres will oppose the self-governing-administrative authority, 
"by democratic, non-violent means." They will take part in all 
self-governing organizations except "the one that will have a 
political, leadership role, so that we will not be 
responsible--legally and politically--for implementing the 
agreement in the eyes of the people." They will pursue all 
avenues of action, except for "military action." 
  The sources denied any link between the changes that are 
ongoing in the Front's mechanism for action and the development 
of the Arab-Israeli negotiation processes. They said that "the 
Fifth Conference, which decided the question of shifting the 
weight to the occupied territories, was held before the 
appearance of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, or rather, came 
in a stage of stumbling in the peace process." They pointed out 
the lack of any uneasiness among PFLP members located in 
Damascus after the Geneva summit. "We are allies of Syria, but 
we do not agree 100 percent on political positions. It will be a 
long time before we feel direct repercussions from the peace 
process." 
  While predictions continue about PFLP offices moving to 
another place in light of visits made by Front officials to 
several regional countries, these same sources stress that there 
is no plan to stay away from the occupied territories 
geographically. "Our decision is always to move closer to the 
battlefield and not away from it."

<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris: "Establishing Palestinian-Israeli </F>
Projects Impossible; Investment of $10 Billion in Autonomous 
Areas Predicted"] 
  [Text] Hashim al-Natshah, chairman of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry in Hebron and vice-chairman of the 
Federation of Palestinian Chambers, stated that establishing 
joint Palestinian-Israeli projects was impossible in the 
foreseeable future. However, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, he 
explained that the Palestinian economy is tied in with the 
Israeli economy, and they cannot be separated at the present 
time. The hope is that the Palestinian economy will become an 
independent economy in the future. 
  Al-Natshah said that Arab economic unity would be encouraged 
and not Middle Eastern economic unity, because that would 
include Israel and other countries. He mentioned that world 
trade and industrial delegations have visited the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip to study future investment opportunities in the 
autonomous areas. "However, we would prefer future investments 
to be Arab." He added that the initial numbers indicate that the 
size of investment in the autonomous areas would reach $10 
billion. He explained that this figure is not large, in view of 
the fact that there is a need for 800,000 housing units in the 
Gaza Strip and, possibly, the demand in the West Bank may reach 
more than 100,000. With this amount of work, activity will open 
up in about 30 professions and will provide jobs for all those 
out of work. 
  Regarding the nature of the investment laws that Arab 
investors will be dealing with and whether they will be 
Palestinian or Israeli, al-Natshah said: "When autonomy is 
applied, Israel will have no connection with these investments. 
Laws will be subject to the Palestinian autonomous government." 
  As to the role of the anticipated normalization process 
between the Arab nations and Israel, in places where there are 
Arab-Israeli investment agreements coinciding with 
Arab-Palestinian agreements, he said that the Palestinian people 
are not unanimously agreed regarding the autonomy agreement. "I 
am one of those who oppose it, but autonomy will be applied 
because it was imposed by the United States. Ideologically, I 
would not encourage any form of normalization, because the Jews 
dream of reaching all Arab countries on the backs of the 
Palestinian people." 
  He said that, at the present time, the Palestinian people 
suffer from economic pressure because the Israeli authorities 
have imposed a security cordon around the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip since last March, referring to the fact that before work 
started on this measure, there were 250,000 Palestinians working 
in Israel, including 120,000 who used to work legally. He 
explained that Palestinian citizens from the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip could only enter Israel with a permit, "but permits have 
only been granted to 35,000 workers so far. This means that 
there are about 21,000 workers who are mostly unemployed." 
  Al-Natshah said that industry in Hebron constitutes about 50 
percent of West Bank industry, which includes, for example, the 
shoe industry. In addition, 90 percent of West Bank production 
is in building stone, ceramics, glass, and canned food. "We 
expect to give future incentives for the export of products to 
Arab nations, since exporting at present is limited to a very 
few products to Jordan. We used to export to certain Arab Gulf 
states." 
  Al-Natshah advised that Israeli officials have rejected a 
request submitted by a group of businessmen in the West Bank to 
provide them with a license to open an Islamic Palestinian bank, 
capitalized at $10 million. He added: "We hope that the 
Palestinian government will agree to open this bank, since the 
Cairo-Amman Bank is now subject to the Jordanian Central Bank, 
as well as the Israeli Central Bank. The Bank of Palestine is 
subject to the Israeli Central Bank." 
  He pointed out that the Federation of Palestinian Chambers 
of 
Commerce is made up of 13 Chambers of Commerce, which meet 
periodically. He said that the population of Hebron totals 
300,000, with some 3,000 merchants participating in the Chamber 
of Commerce.

  [Text] In results that surprised everyone, Fatah Movement 
supporters and pro-Islamic supporters split the seats on the 
Administrative Board of the Association of Palestinian Engineers 
in the Gaza Strip. The elections were held in the city on 28 
January. The Palestinian Engineers' bloc, which is pro-Fatah, 
and the unified Islamic slate, an alliance of the Hamas Movement 
and the Islamic Jihad, won the board's eight seats, with two 
candidates from the two sides being equal in number of votes. 
Agreement was reached that membership for them would alternate 
for a one-year period. 
  In addition, Fatah candidate Engineer Sa'd Kharma won the 
board's chairmanship, by a margin of seven votes over his rival 
Hamas candidate. 
  The Administrative Board is composed of Engineers Sa'd 
Kharma 
(chairman), Jamal al-Khadri, Rafiq Makki, Hassam al-'Alul, Nasr 
al-Mazini, Raf'at Rustam, Salah al-Saqqa, Jamal Abu-Kashif, 
Muhammad al-Wazir (first year), and 'Abd-al-Karim Muhsin (second 
year). 
  Voting began in the morning and continued into the evening, 
until the evening curfew--imposed by the occupation 
authorities--ended the process. Out of the 939 engineers 
eligible to vote, 804 participated. 
  Five electoral blocs competed in these elections, in 
addition 
to two independent candidates. 
  In the elections for the Administrative Board of the Arab 
Lawyers League in the occupied territories, Fatah and the 
independent bloc were victorious, since Lawyers Farid al-Jallad, 
Mahmud al-Mallah, 'Awni al-Barbarawi, 'Ali Ghazlan, Nabil 
Mashhur, Nasr-al-Din 'Anbatawi, Yasir Jabr, Muhammad Musallam, 
Bassam Sahaliyah, Bahij al-Tamimi, and Walid al-'Aridah were 
winners. 
  Thirty-four candidates competed for 11 board seats. The 
number of lawyers voting totalled 368 out of 550 eligible to 
vote.

<F P=106> [Article by Said Gada: "Tizi-Ouzou: Diphtheria Panic"--first </F>
paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Diphtheria is worse than AIDS. At least in the way 
it is transmitted (through the air). This important detail had 
created widespread panic among the people. Among the medical 
community, though, there is calm although the basic tools for 
responding do not exist. Thus far quickly eradicating the 
epidemic remains uncertain. 
  Ever since this epidemic spread in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, 
there has been a combat-like commotion among local public-health 
authorities. Six people have died, a total of 140 people have 
been hospitalized, and there were as many cases of healthy 
carriers, it was reported at the University Hospital Center. 
Besides, the state of alert is always maintained. 
  However at the "Antidiphtheria Combat Committee," which had 
been set up as soon as the epidemic appeared, they are clear 
about it. For them, the situation has just about been brought 
under control. It should be mentioned that this 
multidisciplinary group made of up experts continues to meet 
each Sunday to get updated on the situation. 
  It has been pointed out that the first case of diphtheria 
was 
reported in Ath Zmenzer, a rural community of 11,000 located 
about 10 km from the town of Tizi-Ouzou. A young ninth grade 
student died and several people were infected. Not only had the 
news shaken village residents it had also produced major panic. 
The rush to get vaccinated was indescribable. The small 
treatment room could clearly not satisfy everyone. The doctor at 
the health center, who only works mornings (?), and was 
overwhelmed, had to push the panic-stricken crowd back. 
  Because of the confusion between antidiphtheria vaccines and 
DWTP (diphtheria, whopping cough, tetanus, and poliomyelitis), 
several people ran to private pharmacies (because public-sector 
pharmacies did not sell them) to buy some. 
<H5>  Limited Vaccination </H5>
  After the death of this teenager, only some members of his 
family were vaccinated, it was said. As to the grade school he 
attended, it would appear matters were not taken seriously. One 
teacher recalled: "The day the vaccination team arrived at our 
school, only the dead boy's class was vaccinated and the teacher 
who was in class at the exact time they arrived." 
  Several months later, the wait was still on. Among all of 
the 
staff and all the students, the panic was continuous. 
  Dr. Bourbia, the main leader in the antidiphtheria fight, 
stated that: "a real panic arose around the vaccination in 
Tizi-Ouzou. Of course, even if the vaccines are available, you 
cannot vaccinate an entire population. People need to understand 
that you can only vaccinate [text illegible], such as the family 
or classmates where school children are involved." 
  In fact, these vaccination "criteria" are not followed, as 
we 
have just seen. Is this an isolated case? Don't be too sure of 
it! The people's vaccination coverage is far from satisfying the 
required standards. This epidemic revealed all. 
  At Draa Ben Khedda, a medium-sized city, the situation is 
more dramatic. It is Sunday, 30 January, and the time is 1000. 
At the city's polyclinic, many people are waiting. Parents are 
anxious. A middle-aged woman carrying a baby in her arms 
exclaims: "I have come for my baby's second vaccination and they 
have just told me there isn't any." 
  A nurse would add that: "We are out of our supply of DWTP 
and 
we have been for 10 days. We are expecting a delivery of vaccine 
any day now." Given this situation, parents had to buy it for 
106 Algerian dinars. For their part, pharmacists pointed out 
that all the vaccines were gone and that their orders would not 
be filled until the end of February. In every corner of the 
wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, the diphtheria epidemic is still a primary 
discussion topic. 
  For their part, public-health officials are reassuring. They 
say that of the 140 cases of diphtheria, there were few typical 
cases, and that the number of new cases is clearly declining. 
According to these same officials, the patients are responding 
well, "despite the lack of serum and the insufficiency of 
vaccines." In addition, we would point out that the Nedir 
Mohamed Hospital made available 30 beds from their infectious 
diseases unit and 40 beds from their psychiatric unit. So every 
possible agency was requisitioned and nine patients were 
transferred to the El-Kettar Hospital in Algiers. Furthermore, 
it was revealed that the individuals affected are, generally 
speaking, between the ages of 10 and 15 who were poorly 
vaccinated or not at all. As to the origin of this epidemic, a 
source in the medical community stated that the population of 
the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou was infected by a citizen of the wilaya 
of Bouira who was reported to have stayed in the south of 
Algeria (a region supposedly infected by peoples of the Sahara). 
  It should be noted that the affected areas are the most 
remote (Azzefoun, Ain El-Hammam, Draa El-Mizan). In these very 
remote areas, the people are very far away from health services. 
One country doctor said that he had not been aware of the 
existence of diphtheria in his area until after the burial of 
one patient. 
  Well, now! Even the medical community is caught unawares. 
For 
some, [diphtheria] is basically a childhood disease. 
Furthermore, it is said that there exists another viral illness 
(infectious mononucleosis) that has the same symptoms as 
diphtheria. 
  Upper respiratory ailments (influenza, colds, angina) make 
it 
difficult to diagnose positive diphtheria cases, they go on to 
say. In the case of Dr. Bourbia, he has to wait until the end of 
the winter, which would bring its share of upper respiratory 
illnesses, to isolate the diphtheria cases and hope to eradicate 
it once and for all. But, when you are dealing with an epidemic, 
no one can predict how it will develop. Several questions remain. 
  How did we get to this point? Was vaccination coverage 
correct? At school, is the vaccination certificate 
systematically required? Have the public-health officials 
assumed their responsibilities to force parents to vaccinate 
their children who were born at home? 
  Diphtheria is a contagious, deadly illness. You can be a 
healthy carrier and transmit the disease to anybody who is 
unvaccinated. In other words, the lives of many of us are in 
danger.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "We Want to Spend $42 Million in </F>
Order to Earn $800 Million"] 
  [Text] Tourism is of the utmost importance, because it is 
one of the most important invisible exports that can constitute 
a locomotive for economic progress in Egypt, in view of the fact 
that it is connected to all the other aspects of [Egypt's] 
economic activity and contributes, both directly and indirectly, 
to the anticipated volume of business. 
  At the present time, Egyptian tourism faces a crisis that 
basically consists of a decrease in demand for Egypt's tourism 
product and thus a decrease in the income earned by tourism. 
This is a result of the negative image that has been exaggerated 
by some of the Western media concerning terrorist incidents. The 
Ministry of Tourism has prepared a plan to stimulate tourism in 
order to manage and deal with the crisis. Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji, 
minister of tourism, feels that the element of time is of 
extreme importance in the establishment of this plan and 
obtaining the budget required, in view of what is demanded in 
terms of the necessity of having the ministry comply with the 
proper deadlines in a professional manner so that the plan for 
vigorous promotion of tourism can begin right now, as the time 
draws near for tour organizers and international tourism 
companies to prepare their programs for the marketing of tourism 
for the world's various competing destinations. 
  The minister also feels that the matter requires the 
expenditure of the necessary effort and money, in accordance 
with international standards, in order to stimulate tourism. He 
says that the decrease in income from the fund of tourism and 
the capacities of the private tourism sector, under current 
circumstances, are making it necessary for the public treasury 
to participate in the budget for promoting tourism and that this 
participation will be decisive with regard to the possibility of 
managing and dealing with the crisis. He further states that 
when the expected volume of business occurs, after the campaign 
to promote tourism, then this participation will, of course, 
decline. 
<H5>  Joint Effort </H5>
  Representatives from government agencies, as well as from 
the 
public and private business sector, participated in preparing 
the plan to promote tourism, and the plan will be carried out by 
means of a joint effort undertaken by both government and 
nongovernment parties. 
  The government parties from the Ministry of Tourism are the 
Egyptian [General] Authority for the Promotion of Tourism, the 
principal party in charge of carrying out [such plans] by means 
of its foreign tourism offices actually located in the important 
markets; and the Conferences and Exhibits Authority, which is in 
charge of the work concerning conferences and exhibits and 
promoting them. There is also the Ministry of Culture, which 
participates by providing archaeological models to tour groups, 
as well as certain facilities at tourist sites (the Antiquities 
Authority), as well as the other artistic and cultural agencies 
of the ministry. Then there is EgyptAir, which participates by 
providing both free tickets and tickets at reduced prices, and 
takes part in promotional programs in general. And finally there 
is the Exhibits Authority in the Ministry of Economy, which 
helps exhibits with their marketing and arrangements, if they 
require it. 
  The nongovernment parties provide facilities and services in 
their areas of competence, and they also partially finance the 
plan and are in charge of producing some of the promotional 
tools. These parties are the Egyptian Federation of Tourism 
Organizations, the Egyptian-American Chamber of Commerce (and 
similar organizations), and representatives of the hotel 
establishments and large tourist villages. 
  A permanent committee will be formed to represent the 
government apparatus, as well as the public and private business 
sectors, and this committee will follow up on the implementation 
of the plan and evaluate its results. The committee, under the 
chairmanship of the minister of tourism, will hold meetings once 
every three months in order to evaluate performance, overcome 
any obstacles that might occur, and suggest changes necessary in 
light of the results of practical application. 
  The plan is very much concerned with investing in the tools 
for promoting tourism in six principal world markets that export 
tourism to Egypt, and they were selected in accordance with 
objective and scientific criteria. These markets are the United 
States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan. These are 
the markets that export the most tourism to Egypt, and they are 
also the markets that were most affected by a negative mental 
image of the terrorist events. These six principal markets were 
chosen as the target of an intensive effort to promote tourism 
in accordance with criteria and data dealing with numbers and 
types of tourists, average lengths of stay and expenditures per 
tourist, and the degree to which each market would respond to 
the campaign to promote tourism that will be undertaken. 
<H5>  The Arab Market </H5>
  At the same time, though, the plan does not neglect other 
markets that might represent less volume and be of less 
importance. There will be a continuation and increase in efforts 
made and usual promotional tools utilized in these markets. The 
promotional activities, within the framework of the plan, will 
extend to a number of new markets such as South Africa, East 
Asia, Russia, and East Europe. These markets are promising and, 
at the same time, were not influenced to the same degree by the 
negative image protrayed by some of the Western media concerning 
the situation in Egypt. 
  In view of the fact that the Arab market is of a special 
nature and is one of the important markets that exports tourism 
to Egypt, the plan has borne in mind the necessity of 
intensifying efforts to promote tourism by creating the 
appropriate tools--such as tour groups; hospitality programs; 
intensified contacts with official and professional 
organizations; more reliance on the role of the Egyptian press, 
radio, and satellite channel; and, at the same time, less use of 
the more expensive promotional tools (such as newspaper and 
television advertisements) that are not appropriate for this 
market. In this regard, for example, it has been decided to 
close the Egyptian Tourism Office in Kuwait, within the 
framework of the effort to geographically restructure the 
tourism offices and streamline expenses. 
  The plan's overall budget until the end of the currrent year 
is $36.199 million for the promotion of foreign tourism and 20 
million Egyptian pounds for the necessities for the production 
of printed materials, films, and hospitality programs that take 
place in Egypt (that is, a budget totalling about $42 million). 
The budget required for carrying out this plan until the end of 
next June is estimated at $25 million, since the expenditure 
during the first half of the year will increase as a result of 
production expenses. 
  Dr. al-Biltaji says that the Ministry of Tourism will 
require 
two-thirds of the plan's financing requirements during the 
second half of this year in the 1994/95 fiscal year budget. 
<H5>  Implementation Actually Begun </H5>
  The minister adds: "Since the plan includes 1994 as a whole, 
we actually began implementing some of its programs as of last 
January. They include the hospitality programs for 
representatives of the specialized tourism informational media 
and some of the representatives of the popular world media, 
actual participation in the most important international tourism 
exhibits and markets, financing some newspaper and television 
advertisements, and following up on the normal promotional 
activities in our foreign tourism offices." 
  Dr. al-Biltaji points out that implementing the plan in a 
comprehensive, intensive, and productive manner until the end of 
the year, and then in subsequent years, is something that is 
dependent on the necessary awareness of the great economic 
importance of tourism and the strength of its links to all types 
of economic development and activity in [Egyptian] society. He 
also states that this can only be carried out by providing the 
necessary resources for promoting tourism. 
  The minister goes on to say: "If, at this critical stage, it 
is necessary for the public treasury to shoulder a considerable 
portion of the promotional burdens, it is also true that the 
anticipated tourism business--in fact, it is certain, according 
to the criteria and rates of international expenditures--will 
bring an increase in tax revenues and will also result in more 
business for society as a whole. It will also contribute toward 
solving the unemployment problem, especially among educated 
young people and university graduates. Furthermore, it will also 
lead to prosperity of the private tourism sector and 
consequently to an increase in the volume and proportion of its 
contribution toward paying the costs of this promotional 
activity in the future, and thereby will result in a 
corresponding decrease in the volume and proportion of the 
contribution made by the public treasury. 
<H5>  Main Goal of the Plan </H5>
  The main goal of the promotional plan has been determined. 
It 
is to provide incentives for increasing the demand for Egypt's 
tourism product and to increase the rate of tourism so that it 
approaches that of the year 1992. Achievement of this [overall] 
goal involves several other subgoals, which are the following: 
  1. Raising the level of the promotional tools utilized at 
the 
present time and the creation of some additional tools. 
  2. The creation of a sophisticated library of audio-visual 
materials to serve the purposes of promotion in the future. 
  3. Establishing the framework for coordinated activity 
abroad, which will combine the efforts of the government and 
private sectors in order to serve the cause of Egyptian tourism. 
  4. The creation of an agenda for Egyptian archaeological, 
cultural, musical, and athletic events, which could be utilized 
to attract tourists. 
  5. Opening up new horizons for Egyptian tourism in 
alternative markets in which promotional efforts have not been 
previously pursued in intensive fashion. 
  6. Highlighting the numerous attractive elements that Egypt 
possesses, such as the new tourist areas, an environment free of 
pollution, the hospitality of the Egyptian people and their 
friendliness toward foreigners, and the fact that Egypt has the 
lowest crime rate in the world. 
  7. Providing better opportunities to present Egyptian 
tourism 
development plans and plans for investing in new tourism areas 
to serious foreign investors in order to encourage them to 
invest their capital in these plans, so that new absorption 
capacities can be added to the presently available capacity. 
<H5>  Correcting Egypt's Image </H5>
  The efforts of the activity in the targeted markets are 
being 
focused on correcting Egypt's national image and putting the 
terrorist incidents into their proper perspective, in 
cooperation with the other agencies of the state, which are 
working toward this goal--particularly Egypt's media and 
diplomatic missions abroad. The Ministry of Tourism is 
accomplishing this by means of an intensive advertising campaign 
dealing with the areas and features that attract tourists to our 
country. 
  The goal is accomplished more effectively if one approaches 
the consumers directly. Statistical studies have shown that the 
largest proportion of tourists who come to Egypt come as 
individuals rather than in tour groups. This, of course, means 
that one must utilize widespread popular international media 
such as television, news agencies, and the principal specialized 
and nonspecialized press. 
  Although this approach is costly, the returns it yields are 
double the cost. Therefore, contacts must be strengthened with 
traditional distributional channels such as tour organizers, 
travel and tourist agencies, companies that furnish incentives 
for tourism, conference organizers, associations, and airline 
companies. Also, the level of the sales promotional materials 
must be raised in terms of their language and production so that 
they attain an internationally respectable level. 
  The efforts of the activity are also being focused on the 
implementation of a program for marketing Egypt's tourism 
product, as well as on development and investment on sound 
bases--a program in which one makes use of specialized national 
and foreign expertise in this field and utilizes a group tour 
approach having a variety of components and in which active 
participation in important international tourism conferences and 
exhibitions is involved. The activity also involves the 
establishment of a well-thought-out program for sending out 
invitations to tourist and media personalities to visit Egypt so 
that they see for themselves that the situation is stable in 
Egypt and become personally acquainted with the Egypt's 
historical, natural, human, and cultural features that attract 
tourists. Also, an organized mechanism needs to be established 
to periodically follow up on the phases of the plan, evaluate 
its results one by one, and introduce necessary modifications in 
light of this. 
<H5>  Eight Main Tools </H5>
  The program for implementing the tourism promotional plan 
depends on eight main tools: 
  1. Printed materials: Available printed materials will 
continue to be used, but new materials will be added that, in 
terms of artistic and printing production, will be on a 
competitive international level. 
  2. Films: Five advertising films in different languages 
dealing with both traditional and new tourist attractions are 
being produced. They will be shown over the international BBC 
network, and then over national networks. This will take place 
in each of the six "main tourist markets" over a 16-week period 
that has been determined by marketing experts who know the best 
timing. The periods chosen are April-May and September-October, 
with the films being shown five days per week. Also, two 
documentary films are being produced. The first of them concerns 
the present absorption capacity of Egypt's hotels, the tourist 
villages, the infrastructure, both the traditional and new 
tourist attractions, new areas of tourism development and plans 
for investing in them. The second film concerns the most 
important events on the tourism agenda and shows some of the 
various activities connected with these events, as well as the 
historical and natural panoramic background associated with 
them. Arrangements are being made to have these films utilized 
by the national television networks in each of the targeted 
markets and to have them shown during professional conferences, 
exhibitions, and festivals held abroad. 
  3. Press: Paid advertisements and special supplements are 
being published in the most important newspapers and magazines 
in each of the targeted countries. 
  4. Exhibitions and conferences: An inventory is being made 
of 
the important regional and international conferences and 
exhibitions of a tourist nature, and the necessary arrangements 
are being made to actively participate in them. In addition to 
this, an inventory is being made of the exhibitions and 
conferences that could possibly be held in Egypt, and the 
necessary advertisement plans are being made to increase tourism 
revenue in connection with them. 
  5. Tourism agenda: The objective of this is to make a list 
of 
and confirm a group of various cultural, musical, and religious 
events that are held at certain times and places and 
geographically distributed throughout Egypt's tourist provinces, 
and to include these events in the foreign promotional programs 
in order to acquaint people with them and turn them into an 
additional tourist attraction. 
  6. Foreign visits and hospitality programs: These are 
considered to be among the most important means of promoting 
tourism because they focus on the idea of direct personal 
contacts and becoming acquainted with Egypt's tourist 
possibilities on the spot. Work is continuing on the policy of 
having those persons responsible for tourism in Egypt make 
visits to each of the main targeted markets, and others 
participating in the visits would include people from the public 
and private business sectors. Furthermore, invitations to visit 
Egypt are continuing to be sent out to a select group of 
prominent writers and businessmen in each of the targeted 
markets, and invitations are also being sent to some influential 
international personalities such as the heads of international 
tourist organizations or prominent artists to attend Egyptian 
events. 
  7. Organized tour groups: These constitute a direct field 
activity directed to the consumers. Rrevenue from them can be 
increased by means of appropriate media coverage. Most of the 
[efforts involving] the organized tour groups are being directed 
to the new markets and the Arab market. 
  8. Contests: These are considered to be an effective means 
of 
stimulating popular interest in Egypt and increasing knowledge 
about it. Foreign tourism offices are in charge of arranging 
these contests, together with establishments concerned in the 
countries where the offices are located, whether they be 
schools, universities, clubs, or other groups. The contests can 
take on the form of questions that must be answered, or they can 
be part of an already existing popular contest program in the 
country concerned. In this case, a free visit to Egypt would be 
the winner's prize, and the plan would set aside 180 prizes for 
90 winners and 90 accompanying persons in the six markets, with 
each market having 30 prizes. The contests would be carried out 
in cooperation with international airline companies, EgyptAir, 
and the group of hotels that operate in Egypt. 
<H5>  Choice Between Two Alternatives </H5>
  In conclusion, Dr. al-Biltaji, the minister of tourism, 
said: 
"This promotional plan has the objective of having Egypt attain, 
by the end of the present year, the level of income earned 
during the peak year of 1992, that is, $2.1 billion as opposed 
to the $1.3 billion earned in 1993. This is something that is 
quite possible if we undertake the necessary effort and make the 
expenditures necessary for comprehensive marketing. In other 
words, we want to spend $42 million in order to earn $800 
million." He went on to say: "This plan seems ambitious or out 
of the ordinary. But this is not the case because, in fact, we 
are being confronted with two alternatives. The first choice is 
that we could reduce expenditures in order to deal with a whole 
list of actual priorities and requirements that, in some case, 
are urgent. The second choice aims at the future, would break 
through the blockade of our current problems, adopt the 
mechanisms of modern marketing, deal with the competition, be in 
line with the international rates of expenditures necessary for 
the promotion of tourism, direct the most competitive capability 
in the Egyptian economy toward export, and thus be committed to 
marketing requirements. This latter alternative is the choice 
that I believe we all need to come to the defense of."

  [Text] The violent riots that broke out among Israeli Arabs 
in the wake of the shocking massacre at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs in Hebron have revealed the true face of Israel's 
Arabs. When they took to the streets, they did so not merely to 
express the aching grief they felt from the murder of their 
brothers but also to throw stones, assault Jews, and inflict 
heavy losses--by setting fire to houses, parking lots, and cars. 
Some acted with loud calls for "Death to the Jews," which, for 
some odd reason, were "overlooked" by Israel's state-run media. 
  Security forces, including police and border patrol troops, 
spent long hours battling mobs of rioting Arabs even as Israeli 
leftists attempted to rationalize them as "a display of 
emotions" while openly stating their approval of what happened. 
The Arabs of Israel, residents of the state of Israel, have 
never expressed anger at or disapproval of the murder of Jews. 
That may be their right. But they were obliged to restrain 
themselves this time and not riot so wildly that it is almost 
impossible to remember anything like it since the founding of 
the state. That applies especially to the Arabs of Jaffe, who 
led the disturbances, spurned calls from the police commanders 
and the mayor, Roni Milo, and ran amok; they even threw tear-gas 
canisters at police officers, not to mention rocks and other 
dangerous objects. These are the same Arabs to whom the Jewish 
community in Philadelphia, USA, has donated large sums for the 
restoration of their youth clubs and renovation of their homes 
as part of Project "Neighborhood Renewal." Their brothers in 
Arab nations did not do that. 
  Like them, the Arabs of Nazareth and Ramalla, Tira and 
Taibe, 
like the entire Arab area of the Galilee, in the Triangle and in 
Wadi 'Ara, many would have rejoiced at killing Jews if they had 
not been contained by the Israeli Police, whose members, as in 
Jaffe, for example, did not always display the necessary degree 
of force. 
  It has always been necessary to deal with the Arabs of 
Israel 
with a policy of "respect but beware them." Some have argued 
that they constitute Israel's "soft underbelly." Others complain 
about the presence of a "fifth column" among a portion of 
Israel's Arabs. The recent riots have strengthened that 
suspicion to some extent. Indeed, people have long suspected 
stores of arms and secret "firing practices" usually conducted 
at night, in dry river beds and hidden caves, as preparation for 
the "appointed day." 
  Are we gathering information about these secret 
organizations? Has anyone, for example, looked into the 
complaints made by residents of "Mi 'Ami," a settlement in Wadi 
'Ara, about bullets whizzing past their homes and shots fired at 
night, frequently outside the nearby town of Um al-Fahm? Are we 
waiting for the day when these Arabs will go out not only to 
exhibit their rage but also to attack Jews out of obviously 
nationalist motivations? And how, as a general matter, would the 
Arab-Israeli street view a future possible war? 
  Such a tragic event as occurred in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs 
was exploited by the Arabs of Israel in an extreme, dangerous, 
and outrageous way. That now requires a thorough and fundamental 
examination of how to treat the Arabs of Israel.

  [Text] Even after a week's time, we still cannot fully take 
in and comprehend the significance of the massacre in the Cave 
of the Patriarchs in all its evil and wickedness. That is how it 
always is with events so loathsome that people simply cannot 
absorb them. If we were to make a concerted effort to grasp this 
outrage in its true dimensions, we might well fall prey to the 
blackest bitterness for days on end. 
  To gain some appreciation of this atrocity, which cannot be 
comprehended in full, let us suppose that such a thing had 
happened to Jews. I am attempting here to conjure up from our 
historical memory some anti-Semite driven by ideological hatred 
who breaks into a synagogue and indiscriminately shoots hundreds 
of Jewish worshippers at prayer on Yom Kippur, killing them for 
no reason other than that they are Jews. I recall a great many 
instances when Jews, by the hundreds and thousands, have been 
killed while praying, but not a single time when Jews killed 
others as they prayed. This demented murderer deliberately chose 
the hour of prayer as the hour of his murder. As a religious 
man, he completely understood what it means for a man to commune 
with his God, and precisely at that moment of the soul's 
purification, decided to unleash his welling hatred, that deadly 
hatred of his that had been burning within him all his life. 
  Now we are trying to assess the effect of this murder on the 
peace process, which is the most pressing and fateful issue in 
the short term. Even so, beyond the consequences for the peace 
process, which shall be of short duration one way or another, we 
will be compelled to deal with the effect of this murder on our 
collective psyche, and in that respect the effect will be felt 
for a long, long time, even for generations. This is a subject 
that will be with us from now on because the murderer gave vent 
to dreadful impulses that continue to spread within a large part 
of our public. And this is a public much larger than we are 
ready to admit. 
  Let us not delude ourselves. Goldstein is not an anathema as 
he ought to be for the entire nation of Israel. He is a hero for 
many, and not just in the Jewish community of Hebron. Many 
others are prepared to understand his motivations, rather than 
be shaken by what he did, and to find a thousand excuses for 
redeeming this maggot. 
  We often speak of "the corrupting occupation," but we really 
do not mean a serious deterioration in norms or a steep decline 
in morality, but only petty backsliding bordering on breaking 
the rules of orderly administration. 
  Accordingly, we must finally realize the tragic truth, that 
a 
large part of our citizenry has already been corrupted by the 
occupation to the depth of their souls. Anyone who does not 
believe that should ask the teachers who have discussed this 
issue with their students in Tel Aviv, Hertziliya, Haifa, Be'er 
Sheva, Jerusalem, and everywhere else in the country. 
  The Goldstein virus has succeeded in infecting the 
bloodstream of too many Israelis for us to continue to feel at 
ease with the current state of affairs. Carriers of the virus do 
not exhibit any special outward signs as they meet us in daily 
life, but on the appointed day, a day of peace or of war, they 
are liable to inflict further calamities on us; and the disgrace 
will be ours then, too.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabi Shefer] </F>
  [Text] During Israel's first three decades, national 
leaders molded our political culture and forced it on society. 
In the past decade, the politicians, and all of society as well, 
have been stuck in the quaqmire of the "old politics" created 
back then. Too many times, what occurs in this arena resembles 
what we mockingly call (not always justifiably) the legacy of 
the shtetl, the traditional Jewish village, or events in 
developing countries racked by the forces of fundamentalism. 
  On the other hand, large segments of Israeli society are 
open 
to new ideas and points of view. Above all else, they are ahead 
of the politicians, laying the foundation for a new political 
culture. It is this development, and not switching Labor and 
Likud governments, that marks the political revolution now 
taking place in Israel. This revolution will affect the future 
of Israeli society and politics more than will replacing prime 
ministers, particularly given the obstacles that fundamentalist 
groups are raising before us on the path to peace with the 
Palestinians and the Arab states. 
  David Ben-Gurion and the MAPAI [Israel Workers Party] 
leadership, Menachem Begin and the "fighting family," and all 
the religious and ultraorthodox politicians, too, internalized 
the political ideas and outlooks of most Israelis. These leaders 
fixed the boundaries of what was permissible and what was not in 
society, politics, defense, foreign, and economic policy. They 
formulated the ideologies and political platforms on which 
Israelis grew up and joined the main political blocs. 
  Our passive social habits enabled Israel's founding fathers 
to create three traditional blocs that divided up Israeli 
society and politics, make the political arrangements and rules 
on which these blocs operated and institutionalize the relations 
among them. The heirs of the founding fathers have preserved 
these arrangements. Many have labored to assure their legitimacy 
by establishing powerful economic and political mechanisms, 
which supported the state's educational and communications 
systems. To preserve "the national agreement in light of the 
danger facing Israel," most Israelis have accepted the 
arrangements that the politicians have managed and preserved as 
something beyond question. 
  Ben-Gurion imposed on society the concepts of "statehood" 
and 
"state activism"; Menachem Begin strengthened Israel's national 
foundations, our alienation from non-Jews and the legitimacy of 
Israeli colonization of the territories; and religious and 
ultraorthodox leaders have fortified the hold that religion 
keeps on a number of important spheres of life here, preparing 
the ground for marginal and demented groups such as "Kach" to 
take root. 
  Mobilization of society was accomplished for goals that the 
leaders set and the concessions required of Israelis in matters 
of personal freedom and political rights. This mobilization was 
achieved by developing dependence on the state, by political and 
economic bribes, by "party discipline" and by enforcing 
"movement and national law." From that to the formation of a 
civic political culture was a short step. 
  The civic, political customs, and background of most 
residents of Israel, the continuing political isolation and the 
shaky economic situation have bolstered another foundation that 
has ensured the ability of leaders to continue to shape 
Israelis' outlook and behavior: most of them have been busy 
trying to make sure that they, their families, and their 
community get by. The result has been a narrowing of horizons 
and preparation of the ground for extreme religious and national 
ideas. 
  The connection between the mobilization and discipline 
necessary to ensure achievements in the "struggle for 
existence," and the shrinking of horizons that to a large degree 
was forced on Israelis, have brought about a political passivity 
and a willingness to obey the dictates of any religious or 
secular rabbi. Most Israelis have been content to go to the 
ballot box every four years and cast their votes for leaders who 
will guide the state down a safe and productive path. Most 
Israelis have supported the leaders and their ability to lead 
society almost exactly as they wish. They have left it to the 
leaders to determine nearly every policy they saw fit, to direct 
the public wealth as though it were their own, to launch wars of 
choice, to strip the Arabs of Israel of their property, to allow 
the colonization of the territories, to permit radical groups to 
thrive there, and to engage in wasteful and conflicting economic 
actions. 
  The revolution in Israeli society began, we know, after the 
Yom Kippur war. That war caused many Israelis to reconsider: 
they began putting question marks over many accepted political 
practices, questioning what politicians said and did and taking 
answers with a grain of salt. But the important revolution began 
only at the start of the current decade. Reactions to the events 
of "Black Purim" illustrate this revolution. On the one hand, it 
is creating a new and significant polarization in Israeli 
society itself; on the other, it is creating a gap between 
enlightened groups in society and the politicians. This gap and 
the polarization are unrelated to relations between Ashkenazis 
[European Jews] and eastern Jews or between religious and 
secular, or to the Arab-Israeli dispute. It has been awakened 
between those breaking free of the dark and horizon-narrowing 
civic, national, religious culture that characterized Israeli 
society in the past--and those devoted to that culture. 
  Many indications of progressive viewpoints demonstrate that 
the number of those ready to ask tough questions of themselves, 
others around them and the politicians, and not be satisfied 
with the cliched answers they get, is growing. Here are some 
notable examples of the new positions taken by the Israeli 
public--they indicate the directions that the changes in Israeli 
political culture will take, and that most politicians of the 
old school are finding hard to digest: 
  The reluctance to give carte blanche to a single political 
party; a readiness shown by many voters to change horses during 
the national elections; opposition to allocating unjustified 
resources, such as "special funds"; extensive support for 
privatization of the economy; insistence on a reduction in 
government involvement in economics and society; faith in the 
judicial system and especially in the Supreme Court; demanding 
assistance for weaker groups and readiness to recognize the 
right to strike and protest in order to obtain that assistance; 
an inclination to organize interest groups to protect the rights 
of various social groups and to advance their interests; demands 
of women for equality and full rights; the readiness of minority 
groups, such as battered women, homosexuals, progressive 
religious groups and activists among the Arabs of Israel, to 
organize and aggressively demand their rights; the final death 
of the myth that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the 
security services are all-powerful and that their commanders 
never make mistakes; harsh criticism of public officials and 
state employees who have betrayed their trust; much closer 
attention to issues of quality of life; and much greater 
recognition of the legitimacy of pluralism in modern Israeli 
society. These trends can be seen not only among well-off and 
highly educated "northern" Askenazis; they can also be seen 
among eastern Jews, new immigrants, some groups of religious 
Jews, and the ethnic groups in Israel. 
  As the events in Hebron have shown, alongside the growing 
tendencies to adopt the classic characteristics of liberal 
democracy and lay the foundation stones for "civic society," we 
must realize that we still harbor large groups loyal to the old 
ways of Israeli politics. There are still groups, among both 
Ashkenzis and non-Ashkenazis, religious and secular, Jews and 
Israeli Arabs, who prostrate themselves before the powers that 
be. In their eyes, the IDF and the security services are sacred 
cows. They loathe any group that differs from them, examine 
every incident from a narrow national and local point of view, 
prefer to maintain the status quo and oppose any liberal reform. 
These groups receive encouragement from the positions held by 
most politicians. 
  The political elite of Israel's right, left and religious, 
ultraorthodox camp behave very conservatively, all the more so 
in comparison to more progressive groups in Israeli society. 
This can also be seen among the leaders of the Labor Party; 
true, they have decided, halfheartedly, to advance the peace 
process, a decision essential for creation of an infrastructure 
for change in Israeli society and politics--yet they, and, a 
fortiori, the leaders of the Likud and religious and haredi 
Judaism, still cling to the old political ways in all other 
spheres. Most high-ranking politicians are driven by concepts of 
nationalism and force, and have only contempt for anyone who 
does not think and act as they do. Most of them ignore moral 
considerations when making decisions, and that includes 
relations and negotiations with the Arabs. They still resist the 
final efforts to create a written constitution. They are not 
promoting final enactment of basic laws that will guarantee 
individual rights. They oppose separation of religion and state. 
They are conducting privitization as though it has been forced 
down their throats. They scorn the judicial system, particularly 
the Supreme Court's justified intervention in matters that the 
government has neglected. They are not impressed by the 
criticism heard in Israeli society and attempt to influence the 
state-run media. Issues of quality of life and the environment 
stand very low on their list of priorities. They withhold 
resources from institutions of higher learning and hold academia 
in contempt. They do not undertake initiatives and avoid serious 
dialogue with intellectuals and the Israeli intelligentsia. They 
do not understand the pressing need for reforms in public 
administration. Despite revelations about acts of corruption, 
they either still do not realize that new winds are blowing 
around the world and in Israeli society or are willfully closing 
their eyes to it. 
  Relations among the highest political echelons also reveal 
the hoary diaspora culture that prevails at that level: the 
narrowmindedness and obstruction of adversaries and their 
supporters, open and unrestrained personal rivalries, 
self-indulgence, persistent courting of the media, tireless 
readiness to engage in shady deals and a willingness to cover up 
blunders and transgressions on the basis of personal friendship 
and short-term political coalitions--these are only some further 
signs of a power-based, political culture that does not 
encourage change. 
  Such political conservatism is not the monopoly of veteran 
politicians. Political conservatism also characterizes our 
younger politicians. A young politician who calls for the 
elimination of institutions that seem archaic to him and, in the 
same breath, opposes the possibility that elected political 
bodies will violate decisions made by the government--he is to 
be considered a conservative. Most of the young politicians, 
even if they often look and sound like yuppies, act according to 
the ways of the "old politics." 
  By itself, peace with the Arabs will not work a change in 
Israeli politics. The processes of genuine liberalization will 
occur only when pushed by additional impulses emanating from 
society rather than a leadership bound to a time-worn ethos. 
Thus, only when the gap between groups influenced by liberal 
democratic ideals and Israeli politicians widens will the chance 
for change in Israeli political culture grow. Only then will we 
see the death of the dinosaurs who refuse to allow Israeli 
society and politics to prepare for the 21st century. But the 
old-time politicians and the new alike will not surrender their 
positions, their posts and the benefits that those stations 
provide. Therefore, more progressive groups must struggle with 
firm resolve for a new civilian leadership within Israel's "new 
politics", one that also will be able to deal with the extremist 
movements that gave birth to the murderer from Hebron.

<F P=106> [Article by Elishev'a Aylon] </F>
  [Text] The writer, A. B. Yehoshu'a, stirred up quite a 
public outcry some months ago when he asserted that any of the 
settlers who want to stay in the territories under the 
Palestinian governing authority have to make that possible. 
  Now, when it is obvious that the hard core of the settlers 
will steadfastly refuse to vacate their homes, and certainly 
will refuse to accept the new laws to be applied by the 
Palestinians, the question arises whether, and to what extent, 
the government must take responsibility for those who will not 
obey the law. 
  "What this means," says Yehoshu'a, "is that two 
possibilities 
exist under a permanent agreement with the Palestinians. Either 
the settlers will prefer to receive compensation, leave their 
homes and come back inside the Green Line, or they will 
acquiesce to Palestinian jurisdiction and a Palestinian ID card." 
  It is difficult to believe that the fanatic hard core will 
submit to Palestinian jurisdiction. After all, they do not even 
accept the laws of Israel. 
  "They still recognize the state of Israel. We are talking 
about a Jewish minority facing a million Arabs after the 
agreement. None of them is so stupid that he won't accept 
Palestinian control when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is 
gone." 
  [Aylon] If they do not accept one of the two possibilities, 
will Israel still have to risk the lives of IDF soldiers to 
protect them? 
  [Yehoshu'a] The IDF is leaving. It won't be there to protect 
anyone. There will be Palestinian policemen. They will deprive 
the settlers of their weapons, although only pursuant to the 
Oslo agreement, of course. So, the settlers will have only one 
of two options. There is no third alternative. The handful who 
will cause problems will have to be removed. It will be one man, 
maybe two. This is not going to become the Wild West. Just as 
there will be running water and electrical service, so there 
will be proper laws. And what can they do? If they do something, 
the Palestinian police will deal with them just the way the 
Palestinians will deal with any Jewish civilian who sneaks into 
territory under their authority. 
  [Aylon] Do you think that the massacre that Goldstein 
perpetrated in the Cave of the Patriarchs will speed up the 
peace process? 
  [Yehoshu'a] I hope it will. 
  Recent events have far outpaced the government's rate of 
thinking and analysis. Nonetheless, Rabin, on the basis of what 
he has said, is confident that he is in control of things, that 
the negotiations are proceeding exactly in accordance with the a 
priori concept under which he entered negotiations with the 
Palestinians. He even promised during the election campaign to 
make peace within nine months. He just did not say what he meant 
by peace. But nine new moons are already behind us, the 
gestation period for delivery is receding into a vague horizon, 
and there still is no baby to kiss. Some will say that it is too 
early and that we need to let more time pass. Somehow, the 
politicians always say that it is too early to tell, too early 
to act. The only question is, when will real peace stop being 
too early? Perhaps when it is too late. 
  Goldstein's wife, Miriam, told the press yesterday that her 
husband was not insane, he just wanted to halt the peace 
process. A single sentence loaded with so many signs of the new 
historical situation that is unfolding before our eyes. This is 
not something that began today or the day before. Nor last 
Friday, with Goldstein's death toll. It might have begun during 
the first days of the intifadah when, just as occurred 
elsewhere, a local seed of rebellion was planted. We are talking 
about global processes playing out in our own arena; you can 
feel them in such a tangible way that only obtuse fanatics 
cannot see what is happening to them right under their noses. 
  Isn't it clear that the dominating idea of the next 
millennium will be the liberation of man and respect for him for 
what he is? If, until 50 years ago, no conquering state would 
ever have considered returning the land it had occupied, it will 
be almost unthinkable in the 21st century that occupied lands 
can remain in the hands of the conqueror. That happened in the 
Soviet Union, it happened in Europe, it is happening now in 
Bosnia, and it is happening here, in Israel. Here, however, it 
sometimes seems that the Middle Ages have not yet ended and that 
the Crusades are still in fashion. That, more or less, is what 
Goldstein did. And now he is in the earth, sanctified. 
  He was not crazy, says his wife without realizing that she 
is 
insulting the insane. Statistically, every director of a 
hospital psychiatric ward will tell you, the mentally ill 
usually are not violent, and if they hurt someone, it usually is 
themselves. Barukh Goldstein was a normal man. Apparently, he 
planned his killing operation over the course of many months. He 
went about it as though it were a proper military mission. No 
one would have accepted the excuse of temporary insanity if he 
had been tried for his crime. 
  Given that, Goldstein may have been an extremist although 
absolutely normal, and none of us can hide behind the 
supposition that he was deranged. Nor can anyone absolve us of 
the collective feelings of guilt submerged under the club of 
occupation for the last 27 years. Nevertheless, Goldstein will 
be unable, although that was his declared intention, to stop the 
peace process. For the peace process, even in the local sense, 
is not a process of coexistence and brotherhood but a process of 
self- and national-liberation, and no power on earth can stop it. 
  If Rabin is still angry at [Nisim] Zvili for saying that a 
Palestinian state definitely will arise, it is only 
political-strategic anger, feigned merely so that the other side 
in the negotiations will not think that it already has all its 
freedom in its pocket. It also implies that we, not they, are 
the ones who will decide when, where and how freedom will be 
granted. 
  So, if Goldstein is not plain nuts, nor someone who will 
succeed in stopping the peace process, he at most is one of the 
settler/terrorists, as the radical settlers are prepared to be. 
The act he did has caused a wave of identification among the 
extremists, some of whom had decided even before last Friday 
that the laws of the state are a Zionist farce not to be taken 
seriously. And so, while the government ponders who, if anyone, 
is to be prohibited arms, they are interviewed on television, 
announcing that they have no intention of giving anyone their 
weapons no matter what the government decides. Another wave, no 
less extreme, has already declared that it is joining the hard 
core of those who do not recognize the existence of the state of 
Israel. It is this group of radicals, those who have decided to 
embark on a suicidal crusade but not before taking others with 
them, that Goldstein has represented since last Friday. 
  Now the question arises, what will the government do when 
the 
time comes--and that will be much sooner than people think--and 
a comprehensive settlement between Israel and the Palestinians 
is enforced to the hilt against the settlers, too?

<F P=106> [Article by Yehuda Litani: "Wrong, Yesha' Is Not </F>
Here"] 
  [Text] This week, the Council of the Jewish Settlements in 
Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza region sent me a letter containing 
a small colored pamphlet with the title, "A daily shekel for the 
sake of the settlements." Attached to the pamphlet was another 
page with a standing order to the bank, on the other side of 
which was written: "Contribute by a standing order a daily 
shekel to the settlements, and the medallion will be sent to 
you. A daily shekel: a bronze medallion, 2 shekels a day: a 
silver-plated medallion, 5 shekels a day: a numbered 
silver-plated medallion, by an annual standing order or by 
credit card." 
  All this appears in the framework of a campaign by that 
council that is called "Yesha' Is Here," a campaign during which 
young settlers are covering most of the road signs in the 
country with the same caption, in an attempt to persuade the 
satiated Israelis that Yesha' will pursue them everywhere, even 
in their quiet neighborhoods in the coastal plain, because there 
is no difference, in their opinion, between Nablus and Tel Aviv. 
Not a little has already been written about the change of 
terminology from "settlement" [a heritary portion] and 
"settlement" [a place to live] by the settlers in the 
territories. When their campaigns of pushing into centers of 
Arab population in the West Bank began, it seemed to them that 
they were continuing on the path of Joshua Bin-Nun, the great 
settler [on a hereditary portion] (and, by the way, that is also 
the biblical figure most admired by the former prime minister, 
Yitzhaq Shamir--not King David, not Jeremiah and Isaiah, not 
Moses our Teacher, but precisely the one-dimensional, combative, 
and strong-man figure, a grey and boring man like Shamir 
himself). Therefore, they chose with great pride the words 
"settlement" [on a hereditary portion]. After they learned that 
the word itself was in the eyes of many Israelis a synonym for a 
messianic minority group that seeks quarrel and strife, whose 
entire goal is daily friction with the Palestinians, they 
changed the concept to "settlement" and to "settler," to say: we 
are the torchbearers and following in the steps of the first, 
second, and third aliyahs, we are the true descendants of the 
pioneers and founders of this country. 
<H5>  This Is the Time To Settle </H5>
  On the second page of the small, colorful pamphlet of the 
'Aly settlement located between Ramallah and Nabulus, in the 
heart of the territories of the autonomy that is intended for 
the Palestinians, is written, "Now is the time to settle in the 
heart of...," states the upper caption, and farther below is 
stated: "I went up and I fell in love...how could it not be?" 
And in smaller letters: "You have a wonderful dream. You want 
quality of life, good company, a single home, a well-tended 
garden, a breathtaking view. You want the best for the family. 
You want to participate and be a partner in the upbuilding of 
the land. Call us. We also want to do that. 'Aly's absorption 
team will be glad to host you. You will suddenly discover that 
you, too--in an accelerated process and on excellent purchase 
terms--can realize your dream. 'Aly--a settlement in the heart 
of the country and in the heart of the people. A 40-45 minute 
drive from Jerusalem and Gush Dan. A heterogeneous settlement, 
absorbing families and young couples. Employment opportunities 
and studies at a reasonable distance. Good air and wonderful 
scenery from every window. Houses at surprising prices! 
Possibilities for purchase and rental." 
  Everything is asked here, except for some most important 
matters: Do you want to endanger the members of your family? 
Your small children are endangered every day by an ambush at 
night and stone throwing by day. Have you lost your mind, 
precisely now, to move to this dangerous place, precisely in the 
middle of the negotiations with the Palestinians? Did you know 
that 'Aly is located in the heart of the Palestinian autonomy? 
  It is difficult not to be impressed, for example, by the 
sentences: "A breathtaking view...good air and a wonderful view 
from every window." And what is the landscape seen from every 
window in 'Aly? A landscape of Palestinian villages on every 
side. A 45-minute drive from Jerusalem or Gush Dan, but what a 
route! A friend who is a resident of 'Ofra, which is nearer to 
Jerusalem than the settlement of 'Aly, and who works in 
Jerusalem, told me of her daily fears on the way to work and on 
the way back. That delicate woman, armed with a pistol in the 
glove compartment, and twice a day she is overwhelmed by fear, 
especially when she transports her small children. 
  This is an arrogant notice, which intentionally ignores the 
difficult reality, with the aim of trying to tempt whoever is 
still unaware of the new facts of life in the field. After a 
difficult intifadah of six years, it recommends moving to a 
godforsaken settlement in Samaria, in the heart of the danger, 
and to move from his home within the Green Line for the sake of 
"good company, a single home, a well-tended garden." 
  Who are they trying to persuade, when every day we see on 
television reports about serious concerns on the part of the 
settlers, who are seeking to abandon their homes and return 
immediately, almost in flight, to their former places? Had they 
only mentioned in one or two words the serious and complicated 
problems that confront anyone who decides now to bring his 
family to a settlement in Samaria, it would be possible to 
relate to this announcement properly. But only a fool or someone 
who has become mentally disturbed would believe the settlement 
announcement of 'Aly, which says that: "You want what is best 
for your family." 
<H5>  The Nation Is Behind Us </H5>
  But the height of arrogance is the notice on the following 
page, the third page of the pamphlet, which cites several 
sentences from the appeal, "The Union of Rabbis," in the name of 
a conference of 1,200 rabbis that was held in Jerusalem. The 
notice states: "The decision to give up parts of Eretz-Yisra'el 
that we hold lacks authority, contradicts Jewish faith and 
tradition from generation to generation, was not taken by the 
nation, and action must be taken to abrogate it as if it never 
were. The agreement involves a real mortal danger to many in 
Israel." 
  What does it mean, "was not taken by the nation"? The nation 
accepted it a long time ago, and the proof is that after a 
policy of massive encouragement by the various governments 
(including those of the Alignment, but primarily of the Likud) 
for 26 years, generous loans, almost free gifts of houses and 
land (usurped), the number of settlers throughout the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip comes to 110,000; 2.5 percent of the Jewish 
residents of the state. That is all. An negligible minority, 
indeed problematic, but not significant. The people voted with 
their feet even before they voted at the ballot box, they 
decided to stay at home and not to be tempted to messianic 
adventures. 
  The same appeal by the rabbis talks about the agreement 
involving "a real mortal danger to many in Israel." As if the 
current presence of the settlers throughout the West Bank and 
Gaza does not constitute a real mortal danger for every settler 
and the members of his family. It is precisely their current 
presence there that brings upon each and every settler the 
immediate danger, and every unnecessary presence there only 
increases the dangers. 
  But just as a not inconsiderable portion of the settlers 
already know that their struggle is almost lost, and that it 
will be necessary, at the end of the process, to withdraw from 
most of the area of the West Bank and the Strip, they also know 
that they cannot struggle within their own camp with the extreme 
standard bearers, who march with eyes almost shut to a struggle 
that is already lost, which will only increase division and 
strife in Israel. 
  So we can expect in the coming year and the one afterwards 
to 
be witnesses to an attempt, which already appears pathetic and 
desperate, to hold on to the settlers' past achievements, while 
consciously ignoring and attempting to blur the severe dangers 
and the reality that is crystallizing in the territories. And 
all because they adhere to the anachronistic formula that also 
is written in the pamphlet that is signed by the heads of 
Yesha', according to which, "It again becomes clear that it is 
the settlements that will determine the borders of Jewish 
sovereignty and the future of the state and its security." 
  A sign, which was written by the Yesha' Council on the main 
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road in the area of Latrun, says "Yesha' is 
here." An anonymous hand added below: "Wrong, it is not here." 
Correct, a bad mistake, a mistake that is costing us a lot of 
blood.

<F P=106> [Article by Yosi Melman] </F>
  [Text] Ann Arbor, Michigan. According to foreign reports, 
Israel's missile testing grounds are located on the seacoast in 
the Yavne-Nahal Soreq region, not far from the nuclear research 
reactor that Israel obtained from the United States in 1955. The 
foreign reports state that it was from this range that, in the 
past six years, Israel has made two successful space lift-offs 
of "Shavit" launchers carrying "Ofeq" photoreconnaissance 
satellites. 
  Nonetheless, Israel's most successful space launching 
occurred about 70 km from President Bill Clinton's home. Camden, 
a city in Arkansas, is home to the Atlantic Research Company's 
(ARC) rocket-engine factory. Camden, says James Waller, editor 
of the local newspaper, THE CAMDEN NEWS, is a small, quiet 
"typical Arkansas town where nothing special happens." It is 
south of Little Rock, the state capital, and less than an hour's 
drive from Hope, the President's hometown. Some 15,000 people 
live in Camden, most them employed by the lumber industry and a 
number of defense companies such as ARC. 
  About a year ago, Rafa'el signed a joint venture agreement 
with ARC to develop space-launching technology. Israel Military 
Industries (IMI) is holding talks to sign a similar agreement 
with ARC, a subsidiary of a large defense company, Seiko 
Corporation, which also has factories in Virginia, Maryland, and 
New York. The corporation makes engines for tactical missiles, 
including the "Stinger" ground-to-air missile, listening 
equipment, space radar, and other items for the U.S. Air Force 
and Army. It employs about 4,000 workers, including retired 
generals. For Israeli defense facilities, the object of forming 
ties and linking up with American companies--Israel Aircraft 
Industries (IAI) is also negotiating with some American 
companies, including Fireshield--is to gain a foothold in the 
vast space market, both the international one in general and the 
American one in particular. This tactic, among others made 
possible through the contacts in Arkansas, has definitely proved 
itself. The Clinton administration informed the Israeli 
Government three weeks ago of a change in American policy. 
  The previous administrations of Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush 
had prohibited American companies that manufacture missiles and 
technology for launching missiles into space from forming any 
ties to Israel. As explained by Henry Sokolsky, who was the 
Pentagon official responsible for preventing proliferation of 
technology and strategic weapons systems (nuclear, biological 
and chemical weapons, missiles and components for such systems), 
this policy had several aspects. 
  The first aspect was anchored in an arrangement called the 
"Missile Technology Control Regime" (MTCR), which was 
established in 1987 in conjunction with other Western nations on 
the initiative of the United States. Its purpose is to prevent 
"dangerous" countries from obtaining missiles. The arrangement 
was designed to make it harder for nations in regions of 
international tension or those with unstable governments to 
acquire strategic weapons systems such as missiles. Israel 
refused to join the compact. According to foreign reports, she 
had been cooperating since the 1970's in producing missiles with 
Iran under the Shah and had provided information and technology 
to South Africa, Taiwan, and China. 
  Again, according to foreign reports, Israel was the first 
nation to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East. That 
happened as early as the end of the 1950's, aided by the French 
M-D 66 missile. Foreign reports also state that Israel has not 
only ballistic missiles but the capability to build cruise 
missiles (missiles that fly on a straight trajectory). This 
capability, the reports allege, has been translated into a 
series of ground-to-ground missiles called the "Jericho," 
"Gabri'el" sea-to-sea missiles, air-to-air missiles, and the 
Shavit launcher, which serves as a launcher for space 
satellites. IAI is the primary contractor for the launcher and 
is now developing what is called in professional lingo the 
"pipe," or the platform, and the satellite that it carries. 
Rafa'el and IAI are building rocket engines for the project and 
other companies are contributing electronic, navigation, 
landing, control and oversight systems to producing the "Shavit." 
  Israel's refusal to join the compact prevented her from 
receiving or acquiring American information, equipment, and 
technology relating to missiles and made her a target of the 
preceding administrations' criticism. The gravest accusation was 
leveled in 1992, in a report issued by the General Accounting 
Office [GAO] contending that Israel, without permission and in 
violation of law, was selling China information and technology 
from the American "Patriot" missile. Israel vehemently denied 
the charge. In 1991, Israel announced a change in its position: 
she did not formally bind herself to the regime on controlling 
transfer of missile technology but declared that she would 
observe its terms and act in accordance with them as Russia and 
South Africa have. 
  The second aspect, as explained by Clay Mowry, who handles 
these matters for the U.S. Department of Commerce, relates to 
American import policy regarding missile and space technology. 
This policy establishes that all missiles carrying any equipment 
into space must be produced in the United States. That 
restriction applies to both military hardware (satellites 
carrying photographic instruments, satellites carrying warning 
devices, such as those used during the Gulf war, and 
communications and listening satellites) and the civilian market 
(communications satellites linking up computers, telephones or 
television transmissions), as well as to equipment intended for 
research, especially for NASA [National Aeronautical and Space 
Agency], the U.S. space agency. The reasons for this rule are 
mainly defense based; the idea is to prevent secrets from 
leaking to foreign elements. Foreign companies seeking to 
participate in American projects for launching equipment into 
space, or American companies that have sought to use foreign 
missile launchers, have had to apply to the Commerce Department 
and the GAO to seek an import license. And although some 
European companies and even Communist China have received a 
license from time to time, it has been denied to Israeli firms. 
  As in other security-related fields, attempts to break into 
the American space market have been led by IAI through its 
representative in the United States, Marvin Klimo. With help 
from the Israeli Defense and Foreign Ministries and AIPAC 
[American Israel Public Affairs Committee], the pro-Israel 
Washington lobby, he has attempted to organize a faction in 
Congress. IAI previously had negotiated in vain with local 
companies such as Delta Research. "All our efforts in the past," 
says Klimo, whose title is vice president of IAI International, 
"were always blocked by the administration's policy of 
preventing proliferation" of strategic weapons systems. 
  Now, as noted, that policy has been changed. Two senior 
administration officials, Dennis Ross from the State Department 
and Martin Indyk of the National Security Council, arrived in 
Israel some weeks ago with a letter for the Prime Minister from 
the President. In the letter, Clinton promised Rabin that he 
would change the previous policy. Administration officials 
explained that although the details of the new policy relating 
to Israel are still being worked out, it is already clear that 
the prohibition on exports of missile and space technology 
pursuant to the arrangement will continue. Nonetheless, the 
prohibitions on imports from Israel will be lifted. "Israel will 
no longer be considered a security risk," a senior State 
Department official puts it. From now on, American companies 
will be able to import space and launch technology from Israel 
and Israeli companies will obtain licenses for participating in 
American projects with NASA, the Air Force, and civilian firms. 
The timing of the message--the President's letter arrived in 
Israel direct from Geneva after his meeting with Hafiz 
al-Asad--was interpreted as American prodding, and perhaps even 
as compensation for the future, to induce Israel to show 
flexibility in its negotiations for an agreement with Syria. 
Another explanation, also correct, is based on Clinton's 
sympathy for Israel and his promise made when he met Rabin in 
March 1993, to do all he can to assure Israel's technological 
superiority and promote strategic cooperation between the two 
states. 
  Yet another reason, and no less important, derives from 
Arkansas. In forging business ties to Atlantic Research, Rafa'el 
and IMI are erasing the modes of action that IAI, with no small 
success, developed during the past decade in selling drones 
(through its partnership with a firm from San Diego called TRW). 
The simple rule: establish business partnerships with an 
American company and use them to advance economic interests and 
accumulate political influence. 
  The partnership between Rafa'el and Atlantic Research gained 
a political boost from Arkansas' two Democratic senators. In 
November, Dale Bumpers and David Friar sent a letter to their 
friend and fellow Democrat from Arkansas, Bill Clinton. Their 
letter pointed out that the partnership would contribute to 
Arkansas' economy and add another 200 jobs to the Camden 
factory, which now employs about 500 people. Even if that was 
not the most important reason, it was clear to all involved that 
this connection did not hurt. No president whose main concern is 
internal affairs and reviving the economy can remain indifferent 
to pleas to fight unemployment and aid the economy. 
  Klimo, Rafa'el's representative in the United States, says 
that, under the agreement, Rafa'el provides ARC a license to 
manufacture engines (third-stage engines) in its own plant. The 
price of each engine ranges from $500,000 to $10 million. By the 
same token, IAI and IMI will sell licenses to American companies 
to make their products. According to Klimo, the relatively low 
price of the "Shavit" launcher, which in the United States goes 
by the commercial name "Next," affords them an advantage in 
finding a niche in an important market in the United 
States--launching of small satellites (weighing 1,000 kg). Most 
American manufacturers, such as McDonnell Douglas, make missile 
launchers for large, heavy satellites, at a time when the 
development trend in the space market is for launching small 
satellites, most often for communications. 
  Even so, despite their elation at the breakthrough, they are 
still proclaiming that the path is strewn with mines. There are 
more than a few officials in the various bureaucratic strata who 
are not pleased by the President's decision. As the WALL STREET 
JOURNAL recently reported, they are liable to raise obstacles so 
that Israeli companies will not obtain the import permits 
requested. And launch technology is already known to many; so 
even when they receive licenses, Israeli companies will face 
stiff competition from other foreign firms discovering the 
economic potential of space.

<F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>
  [Text] The Military Advocate-General's report on the 
accident at Tze'elim-2 has broken the bottleneck in appointments 
to the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] senior ranks. It has 
removed the reason--a pretext, really--for the artificial delay 
in appointing new generals to the general staff. Unless, that 
is, things are not as simple as they appear on the surface. When 
the government approved extending the chief of staff's term of 
service for an additional year, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq 
announced that he intends to complete his duties on January 1, 
1995. Thus, he still has about 10 months in his post. 
  What this means is that Baraq, in the final stages of his 
term, is about to decide who will make up most of the generals 
to serve on the general staff of his successor, who already is 
standing on the threshold. If this had been done a year or two 
ago--well and good. The custom has been to permit every chief of 
staff to choose some of the generals with whom he is interested 
in working as a team. This time, the next chief of staff will 
not have any possibility of influencing many key appointments. 
The face of his general staff will be set now for many years to 
come. 
  The next chief of staff apparently will be Gen. Amnon 
Shahaq, 
currently the preferred candidate of Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, who is also the Defense Minister. It would be worthwhile 
for Shahaq to have as much say as Baraq does on the next round 
of senior appointments. The Defense Minister will need advice on 
them from the man who will be the IDF's chief of staff in 
another 10 months, too. 
  The prolonged delay in appointments because of the Tze'elim 
accident was excessive. The longer the Advocate-General's work 
took, the more onerous the delay seemed. The error lay not in 
the extended service of the current generals in their posts but 
in the connection that Rabin and Baraq formed between the 
Tze'elim accident and the appointment of new generals, which 
were completely unrelated. The problem is that this linkage has 
not been severed even now. 
  In fairness, the Chief of Staff did not want to appoint Gen. 
'Amiram Levine to a senior post immediately after he received an 
administrative reprimand. Accordingly, it was suggested that 
only a small round of appointments be made in the first stage. A 
"small round" of appointments could have been made only a while 
ago, before the Adjutant General presented his findings. The 
current round apparently will include appointments to Central 
Command, the National Defense College, and Ground Forces 
Command. If Baraq truly wants to appoint 'Amiram Levine to OC 
Northern Command, he will have to put off further exchanges in 
that command. That means that the "small round" is again 
delaying appointments. Once again, it will entangle officers who 
have no connection to the Tze'elim incident. 
  Shortening the final year of service of the chief of staff 
has put an end to the possibility that another senior officer 
will fill the post of deputy chief of staff before the decision 
as to who will succeed Baraq is put into effect. Baraq has tried 
in recent weeks to convince Shahaq to take a year off, on leave 
or at study, which would permit another officer to perform his 
duties. Although Shahaq was not enthusiastic about that idea, he 
left the decision to the Defense Minister. Rabin is not 
accustomed to making drastic decisions in such personal matters, 
however, and because Shahaq has not asked to go study, the 
situation remains as it was. 
  This plan has gone off the agenda, meanwhile, because there 
is no reason to appoint a chief of army intelligence and a 
deputy chief of staff for just nine months. Such an appointment 
must be made for a period of years; and if it is made, the 
general who wins it will also be the next deputy chief of staff. 
  Appointments have always been a bumpy road for Baraq. Some 
of 
the senior appointments made during his term were done without 
his approval, as in the appointment of Yitzhaq Mordekhay to OC 
Northern Command. Others are not considered successful. 
  In the next 10 months, not only will a new chief of staff be 
appointed but also three regional commanders, a deputy chief of 
staff, and a chief of military intelligence; and there may yet 
be new officers in other senior posts. There is no escaping the 
fact that two veteran generals will be disappointed. A new 
generation of brigadier generals, some of them very good and 
some of them less so, stands on the threshold. 
  It is important to ensure that the next general staff is 
composed not only of talented officers, outstanding 
professionals, and men with a strategic-political grasp of the 
world; also, care must be taken so that the next general staff 
will be truly balanced. Reserve Gen. Yisr'ael Tal was correct in 
arguing long ago that above all else, the general staff must 
always be made up of men experienced in managing the large 
command structures that naturally develop from armored 
formations. The one who must oversee the job of this balancing 
is the Defense Minister, who has to see the appointment picture 
in its totality.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The AL-SHALL weekly economic report said that Kuwait 
is currently debating the future of oil as the country's main 
source of income and that the Ministry of Petroleum and the 
Kuwaiti Petroleum Organization are involved in the debate that 
focuses on three issues--the status of oil reservoirs, foreign 
participation in the production of oil, and prices. 
  The text of the report follows: 
  There is currently no substantiated data on the condition of 
major oil reservoirs, such as al-Burqan, which is of primary 
importance. Studies are still in their preparatory stages. The 
al-Burqan study may be completed before August 1994. Preliminary 
studies of the reservoirs and Kuwait Oil Company estimates of 
other reservoirs indicate that they suffered no major damage and 
that the production losses they sustained from burning were 
limited to three-times the regular production. Other minor 
losses may have occurred in addition to capital equipment damage 
as a result of sabotaging the fields and other support 
facilities for transportation, gathering, warehousing, and 
exporting--all of which, in the final analysis, represent the 
cost of opportunities foregone in the utilization of oil money. 
A Ministry of Petroleum response to a weekly magazine certainly 
agrees with the above summary, even though it lacked in detail, 
perhaps for political considerations. 
  There does not seem to be total rejection in Kuwait for the 
premise of foreign participation, which is the second point of 
concern. The Ministry of Petroleum's response seems to indicate 
that the premise has been accepted on a technical level and may 
have been the subject of precursory discussion by the Supreme 
Petroleum Council. The debate revolves around three caveats as 
we previously mentioned: 
  1.The role of people of influence in pushing through 
agreements that may not serve our national interests; either by 
endorsing incompetent foreign companies or by pursuing 
inequitable agreements. The media of information has a 
constructive role [to play] by alerting the legislative and 
executive branches in order to limit the incidence of 
aberrations that [tend to] proliferate in closed societies. 
  2. The potential for foreign government and private pressure 
utilizing the carrot-and-stick approach as a result of the 
invasion aftermath [as published]. This may be handled by 
raising the awareness of public opinion as well as the 
decision-making authorities. 
  3. The potential of failure in putting the country's 
internal 
affairs in order, especially where the public treasury is 
concerned. This is a pressing matter that calls for urgent and 
unpopular measures if we are to maintain a reasonable 
negotiating position. It seems that the Ministry of Petroleum 
leans so far towards foreign participation in all other oil 
activities such as petrochemicals, refining, and transportation, 
as well as in virgin territories or politically sensitive areas 
of production. But the Ministry of Petroleum's intentions remain 
just that; since the matter must go through normal channels to 
such decision-making authorities as the government, the National 
Assembly, and the Supreme Petroleum Council. 
  The center of controversy is the current and future 
consequences of lower prices as we previously discussed. The 
Ministry of Finance reported on this issue to the Council of 
Ministers and recommended freezing certain expenditures such as 
those for defense, reducing withdrawals from financial reserves 
by 20 percent, and reducing public expenditures by the same 
ratio. But short- and long-term implications exist and may be 
summarized as the potential for widening the cumulative fiscal 
deficit in the face of a large increase in the flow to the labor 
market. Moreover, because of the need for considerable capital 
to develop the reservoirs in order to boost productive capacity, 
we will be in a poor negotiating position unless we contain the 
deficit shortly. 
  The Ministry of Finance submitted to the Council of 
Ministers 
a report primarily based on an earlier World Bank report on 
privatization, one of whose objectives was to ameliorate the 
imbalances in the components of the Kuwaiti GDP, estimated at 
6.3 billion dinars [KD] in 1992. 
  The oil sector and the government services sector account 
for 
76 percent of GDP, leaving 24 percent to others. But this is 
imprecise because of the strong and direct links they may have 
with others. The report deals, in its basic thrust, with the 
attempt to face the potential for a widening public treasury 
deficit, with over-employment where the surplus ranges between 
20 and 40 percent, and with cost differentials. Once again, the 
Ministry of Finance is to be given credit for getting that 
report finished, for commenting on it, and for adopting its 
general principles and presenting them to the Council of 
Ministers, much as it did with its earlier report on the deficit. 
  The report identifies some 74 projects as candidates for 
privatization within five years. Of those projects, 62 are 
companies owned in full or in part by the General Investments 
Authority. Half of the [remaining] 12 projects are in the oil, 
electricity, and telecommunications sectors, or are part of the 
General Ports Authority. 
  The World Bank estimates government ownership in all those 
projects, with the exception of the oil sector, at about KD3.6 
billion ($12 billion), of which the electricity sector alone 
accounts for some KD2.2 billion and all other [sectors] account 
for KD1.2 billion. 
  The report goes into some detail about the candidates for 
privatization. It mentions, for instance, that of 62 companies 
owned by the General Investments Authority, some 23 may be 
privatized directly, six must be liquidated, and 23 need some 
detailed study. 
  Differences do exist on whether the telecommunications 
sector 
should be fully or partially privatized, but they do not seem to 
be insurmountable, and we believe that the [outcome] will be 
dictated by such variables as demand, capital, and the 
stipulations for privatization. 
  The report recommended that the electricity sector, because 
of its structural defects and low prices, be overhauled before 
it is privatized. We believe that there are social and political 
justifications that mandate its gradual transformation, and we 
concur with the recommendation to divide it up. 
  The World Bank recommends establishing an alternative system 
for health insurance, leasing the facilities of the Ports 
Authority, and selling 75 percent of all transportation 
companies, including Kuwaiti Airlines.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Saudi Banks Increase Rate of Loans </F>
to Comply With Growth Requirements"] 
  [Text] Hamad al-Sayyari, governor of the Saudi Arabian 
Monetary Agency [SAMA] (the central bank), has stated that banks 
have a vital and important role in any modern economy. He said: 
"Saudi banks operating in Saudi Arabia undertook an important 
basic role in financing the national private sector in order 
that its projects be carried out during previous development 
plan periods. Total financing offered by them to borrowers 
increased from about 5 billion riyals [R] during the first 
five-year plan to R82 billion in May of 1992. Most of this 
financing was offered to the national private sector. This 
financing was in addition to the enormous financing programs 
offered by the state in the form of long-term loans via special 
funds." 
  He added: "The commercial banks, in order to attract 
citizens' savings and encourage them to make investments, 
created various investment funds that have met with a steadily 
increasing response on the part of investors. Furthermore, the 
commercial banks' methods of operation and the level of services 
they offer to the public have become more advanced in order to 
keep up with international progress in this field. All this is 
in addition to the volume of financing offered by these banks 
and the creation of new instruments to attract citizens' 
savings. These banks have benefited from modern banking 
technology and the introduction of automated teller machines, 
permitting them to offer basic banking services to customers 
both during the regular bank hours and when the banks are 
closed." 
  Al-Sayyari went on to say: "The commercial banks benefit 
from 
the Saudi payments network established by SAMA. By means of this 
network, customers can use the automated teller machines of 
other banks. Also, in order to develop the Saudi financial 
market and improve the procedures for the circulation of shares, 
SAMA has implemented a plan that links the banks' central 
circulation units to the central computer of SAMA itself, where 
these units receive all the offers, orders, and information 
relevant to the circulation of shares. In addition to all of 
this, SAMA and the banks are participating in the international 
electronic communications network that links more than 2,600 
banks and international financial establishments to each other." 
  When referring to the banking sector, he said: "Historically 
it has been one of the oldest sectors that has played an 
important role in the development of the economies of Saudi 
Arabia and the Gulf nations. This sector has been subjected to a 
degree of supervision and control, but this has been necessary 
because the banking operations have expanded and branched out. 
This was the reason for the decision by the minister of finance 
and national economy, on 16 Safar 1402 A.H. [1981], to regulate 
the banking profession, and this task was entrusted to SAMA. A 
whole division of SAMA undertakes the supervision and regulation 
of the banking operations." 
  The subject of the Saudi banks was brought up in a Saudi 
Economics Association conference held in Riyadh, which dealt 
with the topic of the challenges faced by the banking sector in 
Saudi Arabia. One person who spoke at the conference was 
Sulayman al-Mandil, general manager of the Riyadh Bank, and he 
presented a brief history of Saudi banking since its beginnings 
in 1926. 
  "Actually the history of Saudi banking goes back to the year 
1345 A.H. (15 November 1926), when the Dutch Commercial Company 
opened a branch in Jeddah for the purpose of exchanging 
currencies carried by pilgrims from Indonesia, which at that 
time was under Dutch colonial rule. After that, a branch of the 
Indochina Bank was also opened in Jeddah on 18 Jumada I 1367 
A.H. (March of 1949), then a branch of the British Middle East 
Bank opened in Jeddah in the month of Rajab in 1370 A.H. (22 
April 1950), as well as a branch of the Pakistani National Bank 
in the month of Ramadan in 1370. Also, in the early fifties, a 
quasi-banking corporation and some bankers [started operations]. 
These were the beginnings of the Saudi banking sector, which by 
now has become a giant." 
  Al-Mandil said: "The Saudi banking sector, including both 
its 
domestic and foreign operations, was not able, during the oil 
boom period of the seventies, to meet the demands of development 
in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries. This provided a great 
incentive for the emergence of the off-shore banks, among which 
a great many were established in Bahrain." After referring to 
the period all during the seventies when foreign banks such as 
the Dutch, French, British, Arab National, and Cairo banks 
flourished, he said: "The process of Saudiization of the capital 
of these banks began, and this was the source of a great 
incentive for them to begin important steps of development. 
Consequently, there began the processes of modernization of 
methods of administration and the utilization of modern 
technology. When the seventies came to an end, the Saudi banking 
sector had already become strong and profitable, in spite of the 
fact that international establishments continued to participate, 
to a considerable degree, in the financing of the development 
projects." 
  After having dealt with the period of the eighties, the 
stumbling debt crisis due to clients' inability to honor their 
obligations, and the fact that Saudi banks were able to 
successfully overcome this crisis due to their high degree of 
solvency at that time, al-Mandil went on to say: "The present 
situation of the Saudi banks is good, and the banking sector as 
a whole possesses clear elements of strength, which are the 
following: 
  "1. A high degree of financial solvency. The assets of these 
banks have increased from R5.86 billion in 1973 to R318 billion 
in 1993 (about $84.2 billion), and this is twenty times what the 
banks had twenty years ago. Also, shareholder equities have 
increased from R243 million in 1973 to R30.2 billion in 1993. It 
has been shown that [a bank's] degree of solvency, according to 
criteria set by the World Bank, should be not less than 8 
percent of its total assets as shareholder equities. The 
solvency of Saudi banks as a whole during 1992 was 13 percent, 
and this is higher than the solvency of banks in Japan (9 
percent), Britain (10.6 percent), and France (8.8 percent). 
Total assets of the Saudi banking sector amounted to R318 
billion. 
  "2. Diversification of the Saudi banking sector. It includes 
all of the national banks and joint banks. This is a source of 
strength since it is a source of enrichment and diversification 
for banking operations. 
  "3. The dynamic nature and capability of the Saudi private 
sector has constituted an element of strength for the Saudi 
banking sector. 
  "4. The fourth element of strength of the Saudi banking 
sector is the existence of SAMA, because in its work it has gone 
beyond the traditional role of central banks in the world today 
as a high bank commissioner in case of crises, and it has taken 
on the job of developing the Saudi banking sector and impelling 
it to utilize the world's most modern banking methods." 
  The general manager of the Riyadh Bank went on to say: 
"Saudi 
banks face several challenges, such as the acquisition of 
technological development, the development of the Saudi banking 
sector, the improvement of conditions of the work force, and 
expansion of loan activities." He then pointed out: "Saudi banks 
are in the process of facing these challenges concerning the 
acquisition of technology or development of the Saudi private 
economic sector. As far as the work force is concerned, there 
are requirements for them to be trained and to improve their 
qualifications. These banks currently have 25,600 employees, 55 
percent of whom are Saudis. Total Saudiization will require a 
few more years, since it is proceeding at a rate of 5 percent 
per year, and the Saudiization of the jobs has to proceed 
gradually in view of the specialized positions that are occupied 
by foreign employees. 
  "The last challenge is that of loans, and this is something 
that the Saudi banks can increase. The volume of loans as 
compared with the banks' total assets at the present time is 
R104 billion out of a total of R318 billion, that is, they 
constitute 33 percent of these assets. This is an indication of 
the fact that loans can be increased." 
  The Basel Committee has classified Saudi banks as being in 
the same category as those of the advanced industrial nations. 
In spite of this fact, most of the Saudi banks have increased 
their capital. The solvency and sufficiency of their capital 
have reached a percentage higher than that set by the Basel 
Committee. Al-Sayyari said: "The percentage of sufficiency of 
the capital of the Saudi banks, by the end of April of 1992, and 
according to the Basel Committee's criteria for "probable 
dangers," totalled 9.6 percent, as compared with the figure of 8 
percent, which is required by the committee." 
  The fact is that Saudi banks are a reflection of the Saudi 
economy itself in terms of its stability and ability to achieve 
development when faced by crises. In this regard, the newspaper 
IRISH TIMES says that Saudi Arabia has followed the policy of a 
free market economy, diversified production and the sources 
thereof, encouraged industrial and agricultural development in 
the private sector, developed its work force personnel, 
increased economic cooperation on all levels, and utilized its 
wealth and revenues in development programs on the national 
level in order to hasten the rates of growth in the industrial 
and agricultural sectors after having provided them with the 
appropriate infrastructural support.

<F P=106> [Report by Atiliu Judiu on interview with Hasan al-Turabi; </F>
place and date not given: "We Have No Dealings with Iran, Not 
Even One Dollar's Worth!"] 
  [Excerpts] Hasan al-Turabi, in an interview conducted with 
him recently, said: "The secession of the south would be worse 
than what is happening in Somalia. The northern part of Sudan 
would consider neglecting the south to be an unforgivable crime, 
even though the north's area is equal to that of France and 
Italy together. Sudan must also remain a united and 
nonfragmented country. In the past, in Europe wars broke out 
between the nations there, but today Europe is a single entity. 
Perhaps the day will come when Africa will be united as a single 
entity. We Africans need unity more than Europe does, and we 
must overcome nationalisms that are based on the mentality of 
the existence of borders." 
  He said that there are wars going on in the south between 
competing rebel groups and that this is making it difficult for 
the inhabitants to freely vote for their future during 
elections. He added: "We must also consult the inhabitants of 
the south who have fled to the north in order to take refuge 
there. And we do not know whether or not the federal solution 
for the three provinces in the south would be the best way to 
put a stop to the violence." [passage omitted] 
  In response to a question regarding Sudan's isolation due to 
allegations of terrorist connections to Iran, al-Turabi replied: 
"We have no dealings with Iran, not even one dollar's worth." He 
went on to say: "There are no Iranian tourists in Sudan, nor is 
there a single [Iranian] soldier or military attache [in Sudan]. 
The majority of Iranians are Shiites, whereas the majority of 
the Sudanese are Sunnis. The two nations are Islamic nations on 
the political level. We in Sudan are concerned about Islamic 
values in our education, economy, and politics, whereas in Iran, 
Islamic values are utilized as slogans for a revolution. Sudan 
has no tradition of terrorism, and no one has ever been a victim 
of a political attack." 
  In reply to a question about whether or not his country 
would 
accept political refugees such as members of the banned Algerian 
terrorist groups, al-Turabi replied: "There are four or five 
Algerians in Sudan who came to our country from Libya. They 
actually are refugees, but not political refugees. There are 
also other refugees in our country: 750,000 refugees from 
Ethiopia, a million refugees from Nigeria and Uganda, and about 
250,000 Palestinian refugees, of whom some are from the Hamas 
movement and others are supporters of 'Arafat. We also have 
200,000 Egyptians, some of whom work here." Al-Turabi wondered: 
"If Sudan is, for example, more Islamic on the political level 
than Egypt is, does that make it more suspect?" He also asserted 
that he does not consider himself to be basically a 
fundamentalist or an Islamic extremist. 
  He said: "The implementation of Islam in Sudan is not just a 
cultural movement, but is also an intellectual movement, which 
has the goal of creating a new expression of Islamic values in 
order to solve contemporary problems. The goal of our efforts is 
to achieve what is best for our country's economy and 
agriculture and to eliminate political corruption. Our goal is 
to have moral values and unity among our tribes and religious 
groups in a single society. We do not have expansionist or 
military goals, nor do we have any goals that are financial or 
connected with the media." 
  What about Sudan's relations with Egypt and Algeria, who are 
experiencing a wave of terrorist attacks waged by Islamic 
extremists and whose governments assert that foreign elements 
are responsible for this? Al-Turabi replies: "Any modern 
movement in a given society has to know how to conduct itself 
vis-a-vis the government in power. If the government dominates 
it, then this will generate resistance, and a revolution might 
be necessary. This is why the French revolution occurred. But if 
there is freedom, even to a limited degree, then it is better if 
there is normal progress in the direction of Islam instead of 
revolution. Islam is a religion, and there must take place the 
occurrence of real and gradual progress toward it. In Algeria, 
the majority voted for the Islamic movement in its elections, 
but the army prevented its taking power. The Algerians are a 
mountain people and thus reject any form of coercion, just as 
they did when resisting French `imperialism.' Unfortunately, the 
struggle between the goverment and the opposition is something 
that is squandering all the energy of the people and the 
country. I hope that Algeria will have at least a minimum of 
freedom and equilibrium. However, the imposition of Islam by 
force would not do any good." In conclusion, al-Turabi said: 
"The jihad means defending oneself, not waging a war. We cannot 
win people's hearts by means of imposing Islam by force. If 
belief [in Islam] is something superficial, then Islam will 
attract only hypocrites and not [true] Muslims. I am a religious 
person and do not like the use of force."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sudanese Political Organization </F>
Attacks Government and Opposition] 
  [Text] At a press conference held in London yesterday, a 
group of Sudanese announced the establishment of a new political 
organization called the "Sudanese Federal Democratic Alliance." 
  The leaders of the new organization announced that their 
motive for establishing this organization is their fear for [the 
future of] Sudan, especially after talk began going around 
concerning the secession of the south, in view of the failure to 
deal with Sudan's vital issues concerning determining its 
identity, building its society, and establishing foundations 
that would include [all Sudanese] people in a single country and 
promote the building of the country. Mr. Ahmad Ibrahim Durayj, a 
Sudanese politician who was formerly the governor of the 
province of Darfur, is head of the founding committee of the 
Sudanese Federal Democratic Alliance, and he said, in a 
statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, that his political group is 
broaching political ideas and is not hostile to any political 
party. He said that their political ideas are non-partisan and 
are directed to all Sudanese, regardless of their political and 
geographic affiliations and orientations and their religious 
beliefs. 
  The press statement distributed by the new organization 
pointed out that, after 38 years [of independence], Sudan is 
suffering from an unprecedented decline and collapse of its 
national institutions. He added: "The civil war continues to 
take the lives of thousands of Sudanese citizens and to force 
millions to flee their homes and villages, thus causing poverty 
and famine, destroying the nation's infrastructure, blocking all 
efforts for development, and leading to the collapse of the 
economy." 
  The statement, signed by Mr. Durayj, criticized the present 
regime in Khartoum, which he described as a "continuation, in 
the extreme sense, of the political views of the sectarian 
leadership of the country's two main parties." He said: "All 
political opposition forces have failed to create a common 
framework with our brethren from the south, and this has made it 
even more likely that the nation will become fragmented." 
  The new alliance indicated that it is not a political party, 
but rather a democratic political organization that has the goal 
of gathering together all political and social forces as well as 
individuals. 
  He said that he is committed to eliminating the current 
regime in Sudan, "but does not wish to put in its place forces 
that would attempt to carry out a program that would not differ 
from that of the current regime." 
  The leaders of the new organization feel that the form of 
government that has existed in Sudan since independence has been 
a failure. They consider the federal form of government to be 
the solution to the governmental crisis as well as the problems 
of both the administrative center and the provinces. They also 
stress, first and foremost, the need to establish the necessary 
laws and programs for building a unified country, and they feel 
that religion should not play a role in politics--in other 
words, they favor the building of a secular state.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "Clinton Rakes Up Human Rights </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15--The U.S. President, Mr. Bill 
Clinton, reaffirmed on Monday the increasing alignment of his 
country's position with that of Pakistan on Kashmir, a 
development that could further set back relations with India. 
All American pretence of providing an even-handed approach to 
the problem now appears to have been dropped. It is possible 
that the Clinton Administration is stepping up its diplomatic 
activism on Kashmir to extract major concessions from India and 
Pakistan on the nuclear issue. The policy of linking nuclear 
non-proliferation in the subcontinent to the resolution of the 
Kashmir dispute is being fully backed by Pakistan. 
  Declaring that promoting respect for human rights around the 
world was a "pillar" of U.S. foreign policy, Mr. Clinton 
declared that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights 
abuses in Kashmir." His remarks came while accepting the 
diplomatic credentials of the new Pakistani Ambassador to the 
United States, Ms. Maleeha Lodhi. Mr. Clinton made no effort to 
provide a balance by either referring to terrorism or 
territorial integrity of States in the region. All that he had 
to add on the subject was "we also oppose infringements of 
individual human rights as a result of extremism and fanaticism, 
whether of religious or secular nature, wherever it occurs." 
<H5>  Plea to Clinton </H5>
  Ms. Lodhi made a strong plea for U.S. support on Kashmir, 
when she presented her credentials to Mr. Clinton. In a speech 
peppered with resounding references to the founding fathers of 
the United States, she called on Mr. Clinton to use his "good 
offices to put the issue of Kashmir on the front burner of world 
attention," so that there was a breakthrough in 1994 on the 
issue that "threatens regional stability and world peace." 
  Declaring that the people of Kashmir were alone in the 
subcontinent in being denied "self-determination," she alleged 
that "half a million brutal occupation troops (were) making 
their life miserable," and that they "are denied the basic tenet 
of Jeffersonian democracy," the "pursuit of happiness." Praising 
Mr. Clinton for his policies on promotion of human rights and 
democracy, Ms. Lodhi asked him, "can we proselytise democracy 
around the world, and deny it in Kashmir? Can we reach human 
rights but only selectively apply it when convenient? Mr. 
President, morality selectively applied is by definition 
immoral. It is not worthy of the new global agenda to which both 
our nations strive." 
  Ms. Lodhi thanked Mr. Clinton for bringing the issue of 
Kashmir before the United Nations last September, and said she 
was encouraged by the remarks of Ms. Robin Raphel, U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, who has 
called for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute "in a way 
consistent with the views and aspirations of the people of the 
valley." 
<H5>  Dialogue Welcomed </H5>
  He looked forward to the occasion when he could "accept" the 
offer of the Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, to visit 
Pakistan, Mr. Clinton said. He had a "strong interest in 
reducing tensions in South Asia and especially encouraging 
productive relations between Pakistan and India." Welcoming the 
resumption of Indo-Pakistan dialogue, Mr. Clinton called the 
Foreign Secretary levels talks "an important step to address 
outstanding issues, including Kashmir and the control and 
elimination of weapons of mass destruction." 
  Ms. Lodhi made a strong appeal to the United States "to 
seize 
its unipolar moment to implement the goals we share: peace, 
security and non-proliferation." Declaring that Pakistan shared 
U.S. goals on non-proliferation in South Asia, she called on Mr. 
Clinton to end the current "discrimination" against Pakistan, in 
the form of the Pressler Amendment. Expressing anguish that the 
Amendment targeted only one nation on the earth, Pakistan, she 
said the current U.S. law on non-proliferation "removes all 
incentives to India, which is the only nation in South Asia that 
has demonstrated a nuclear capability, to be forthcoming on the 
question of non-proliferation." 
  Ms. Lodhi reiterated the readiness of the Government of 
Pakistan "to go any place, at any time, and talk to any one to 
advance the cause of a nuclear free South Asia." She urged Mr. 
Clinton "to act as a facilitator of a new initiative, a new 
dialogue on a regional solution to the problem of proliferation." 
<H5>  `Eliminate Weapons' </H5>
  In his response, Mr. Clinton noted that India and Pakistan 
were engaged in programmes to acquire weapons of mass 
destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. "Continuing 
tensions between Pakistan and India, combined with these 
on-going programmes, creates the potential of a nuclear exchange 
with devastating consequences for the region and the world at 
large." He asked Ms. Lodhi to "work constructively with us to 
cap such weapons programmes, and then to reduce and eliminate 
weapons of mass destruction from South Asia." 
  On purely direct bilateral relations, Ms. Lodhi made a 
strong 
sales pitch for the continuing "strategic relevance" of Pakistan 
to the United States. She declared that Pakistan was a model of 
"enlightened, progressive Islam for the entire world." As a 
nation of "moderation," Pakistan could provide a "nexus" between 
southwest Asia and the West Asian and the Central Asian 
republics. Mr. Clinton welcomed the economic reforms in Pakistan 
and expressed the hope that "Pakistan will enact and enforce 
tough laws to fight the drug trade more vigorously." 
  The emerging consensus between the United States and 
Pakistan 
on Kashmir and the nuclear issue remains, however, to be 
consolidated.

<F P=106> [Article by K. K. Katyal] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 15--Just when there was hope of a 
positive turn to Indo-U.S. relations--as a result of the 
visiting Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's talks here--the 
American President, Mr. Bill Clinton's reference to human rights 
violations in Jammu and Kashmir meant a fresh setback. 
  Mr. Clinton's remark that the United States shared 
Pakistan's 
concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir, caused, as was 
natural, shock and dismay. Its adverse effect was not mitigated 
even by his subsequent observations--that the United States was 
opposed to infringements of individual human rights as a result 
of extremism and fanaticism, that is, of the victims of 
terrorist violence. It showed, according to an official, that 
the U.S. policy was either not balanced or not well-informed. It 
was considered odd that Mr. Clinton should have been taken in by 
Pakistani propaganda--ignoring altogether the steps taken by the 
Indian Government to check excesses, including the establishment 
of the Human Rights Commission, as also the discussion to allow 
the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty 
International to visit Jammu and Kashmir. That such statements 
would give a fillip to terrorist activities was additionally 
disturbing from the Indian standpoint. 
  Even before Mr. Clinton's latest statement there was a 
perception here that the U.S. Administration's India policy was 
not anchored in an objective analysis of the situation in the 
sub-continent. Mr. J.N. Dixit, who just retired as Foreign 
Secretary, was asked in an interview by "Eyewitness," about the 
reasons for the statements emanating from Washington on Kashmir 
and Punjab. He replied: "There can be only two interpretations. 
Either they are simplistic and you can say it is tactless or 
there is a deliberate motivation and they may be saying this 
deliberately to set the context for interference." 
  This, in his opinion, was the most difficult period in 
Indo-U.S. relations since 1971 and it could last up to two 
years, because of fundamental differences on issues such as 
nuclear non-proliferation and transfer of dual-use technology. 
  Until the report of Mr. Clinton's statement reached here, 
the 
mood of those working for improved Indo-U.S. relations was 
clearly upbeat. The talks of Mr. Moynihan, Chairman of the U.S. 
Senate panel on South Asia and a former U.S. ambassador here, 
with the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, yesterday and 
with the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, today had 
led to optimism about a better understanding of India's case on 
Human Rights and related matters. 
  Mr. Moynihan who, at a recent Senate panel hearing, had 
strongly defended India on this issue heard a detailed account 
from the Prime Minister of the latest developments--especially 
in the context of Pakistan's plans for an anti-India resolution 
at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights at Geneva. He told both 
the Prime Minister and Mr. Dinesh Singh that he would convey 
India's views to Mr. Clinton. He even suggested a meeting 
between Mr. Dinesh Singh and the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. 
Warren Christopher, obviously in the belief that exchange of 
views at the personal level could help reduce misunderstandings. 
  Hopes recede: In view of Mr. Clinton's latest 
statement, the chances of India securing U.S. support against 
Pakistan's move have receded, though Mr. Moynihan's talks here 
had raised hopes to the contrary. It is, however, to be seen how 
the United States reconciles the two conflicting 
concepts--support to Pakistan's view of human rights "abuses" in 
Jammu and Kashmir, on the one hand, and faith in the 
continuation of the Foreign Secretary-level talks between India 
and Pakistan, on the other. The consequences of the first run 
against the spirit of the second. 
  According to Mr. Clinton, "these talks and other forms of 
dialogue between Pakistan and India should be nurtured and 
protected from swings in public opinion so that they become a 
positive feature in Indo- Pakistan relations." Will the United 
States discourage Islamabad from going ahead with its move 
because its consequences may not square up with his sentiment 
about the Foreign Secretary-level talks being a forum for 
defusing tensions between India and Pakistan?

<F P=106> [Article by Inder Malhotra: "Reality of Indo-U.S. Relations"] </F>
  [Text] On February 8, the U.S. charge d'affaires 
in New Delhi, Mr Kenneth Brill, wrote on this page, under the 
heading "All's Well Between India and the United States," that 
relations between the two countries were on a "sounder and more 
substantial footing than they have been for decades." The 
widespread contrary impression, that the Indo-U.S. relationship 
is at a "low ebb," he attributed to the media's proclivity to 
play up differences, "real or imaginary," rather than positive 
developments. 
  Mr Brill was, of course, doing his duty as any good 
professional diplomat would, especially if he carries the heavy 
burden of running one of America's largest embassies which has 
been without an ambassador for nearly a year. Moreover, and more 
importantly, most of what he had to say was doubtless factually 
accurate. 
<H5>  Big Leap </H5>
  It is a fact, for instance, that economic relations between 
India and the United States have taken a big leap forward. A 
fifth of all Indian exports do go to America, and the two-way 
trade in 1993 seems to have touched the record figure of $7 
billion, compared with $6 billion in the preceding year. 
Equally, if not more, welcome is the dramatic rise in U.S. 
investments in this country, more American funds having been 
invested during the last 12 months than in the previous four 
decades. And, although Mr Brill did not say so, the formation of 
an India Interest Group by a number of U.S. corporate giants is 
a fact of great importance and something to be built upon. 
  At the same time, all this adds up to a classic case of 
facts 
obscuring the truth. For, if it is wrong to overlook or 
underplay the significant upswing in Indo-U.S. relations, it is 
equally erroneous to concentrate only on positive developments 
in the economic sphere and brush aside, with a flippant wave of 
the hand, the very real and, at times, hurtful differences of a 
political and strategic nature. These are neither imaginary nor 
inconsequential. 
  In any case, to Mr Brill's ill-luck and this country's 
growing dismay, shattering blows have been delivered to his 
basic thesis within days of the publication of his article. This 
was done first by Ms Robin Raphel, arguably the most powerful 
assistant secretary of state and the Clinton administration's 
"pointsperson" in running South Asia policy, in her speech to 
Asia Society. And now President Clinton has added insult to 
injury by "sharing Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses 
in Kashmir." 
  This was no off-the-cuff remark. It was a statement of U.S. 
policy on the occasion of the presentation of credentials by 
Pakistan's new ambassador, Ms Maleeha Lodi, who had not only 
embarked on an anti-India tirade but also invited the U.S. 
President to use his "good offices" to "put the Kashmir issue on 
the front-burner of world attention." 
  Mr Clinton's subsequent and feeble remark--that his country 
also opposed "infringement of individual human rights as a 
result of extremism and fanaticism, whether of religious or 
secular nature, wherever it occurs"--can in no way diminish the 
deep offence he has caused to this country. 
  Doubtless, strenuous efforts would be made in the coming 
days 
by Washington to try to limit the damage done by the U.S. 
President who is known to have little time for foreign policy 
(witness the eight minutes out of 63 devoted to international 
affairs during the State of the Union speech) and whose 
understanding of the complexities of problems like Kashmir is 
even more limited. There would, once again, be homilies that 
India should not "over-react" to what has been said. But no 
amount of special pleading can explain away the wounding element 
in the U.S. policy towards India which remains a complex mix of 
the good, the bad and the indifferent. 
  In order to understand what is really going on, Mr Clinton's 
latest performance has to be viewed in the context of his own 
two recent letters--which have given great comfort to the 
merchants of terror and secession in both Kashmir and 
Punjab--and the words and deeds of his hand-picked assistant 
secretary of state for South Asia. 
<H5>  Vigorous Protest </H5>
  No one could have forgotten that, after Ms Raphel's Asia 
Society speech, the official spokesman of the external affairs 
ministry, not just the much-maligned Indian media, had protested 
vigorously against her extraordinary attempt to equate the civil 
war in Afghanistan (at least partly a product of America's 
massive support to rival Mujahideen groups through the conduit 
of Pakistan's infamous ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], now 
busy in Kashmir) and the Pakistan-backed scattered insurgencies 
by various militant groups in the Indian state of Kashmir. The 
sentiment on this score at a subsequent meeting of Parliament's 
consultative committee on foreign affairs was even stronger. 
  It would, of course, be churlish to pretend that all policy 
statements on South Asia, emanating from the Clinton 
administration, are entirely negative. In Ms Raphel's speech at 
Asia Society, as in her earlier testimony to a special panel of 
the Senate foreign relations committee, there was a lot about 
India which was positive and friendly. 
  Indeed, what makes Mr Clinton's statement on human rights 
abuses in Kashmir as puzzling as it is pernicious is that its 
spirit and tenor run counter to what happened at the Senate 
panel's hearing on this subject. In her presentation Ms Raphel 
had repeatedly emphasised the various actions India has taken to 
enforce the observance of human rights in Kashmir and to punish 
those who did commit excesses. 
  So much so that Senator Jesse Helms, a known India-baiter, 
interrupted Ms Raphel to exclaim: "But killings took place in 
Kashmir last week." To which Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
now on a visit to Delhi, retorted: "And they will take place 
next week, just as they will take place in Belfast." Little of 
this percolated to the Indian public but surely the White House 
could not have been unaware of the proceedings. That is where 
the conclusion is inescapable: that there is a connection 
between what the U.S. President has just said and the Kashmir 
policy, as enunciated at Asia Society by Ms Raphel. 
<H5>  Full Backing </H5>
  It is noteworthy that, while equating Afghanistan and 
Kashmir 
and announcing her government's determination to do something to 
bring "warring parties" in both places to the "conference 
table," Ms Raphel had told all concerned that this was not her 
personal policy but had the full backing of Mr Clinton. The 
President's remarks obviously confirm this which means that Ms 
Raphel's observations, especially on Kashmir, require close 
scrutiny. Even while conceding that there were "limits" to what 
the United States could do about Kashmir, she had emphatically 
asserted that Kashmir would remain "high" on "my agenda." It is 
legitimate to wonder what that agenda might be. 
  Time was when it appeared that the United States needling, 
prodding and hectoring of India over Kashmir was but a ploy to 
force it to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This no 
longer holds water as any number of ranking Americans have 
acknowledged that India would not sign this treaty, no matter 
what. It follows therefore that pressures on Kashmir stand on 
their own. In this context, is it purely accidental that China, 
in top-level talks with Pakistan, has vehemently opposed the 
idea of an independent Kashmir which, according to Beijing, is 
sponsored by the United States? 
  This brings me to what the Americans would call the bottom 
line. Economics may have become the principal factor in 
international transactions. But burgeoning economic relations 
between India and the United States by themselves cannot make 
for a friendly relationship if, at the same time, India's unity, 
territorial integrity, supreme interests and deepest 
sensitivities are sought to be trifled with.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Blinkered View"] </F>
  [Text] Considering that the U.S. State Department's South 
Asian desk has begun to compare the situation in Kashmir with 
the civil war in Afghanistan and has even been questioning the 
validity of the state's accession to India, Mr Clinton's latest 
remarks which have brought great joy to Pakistan are not all 
that surprising. In essence, what they denote is a strange 
reluctance on Washington's part to view the problem in all its 
complexity and an equally peculiar propensity to endorse without 
a thought the patently-motivated Pakistani propaganda on human 
rights violations in the valley. To the Americans, the problem 
is not really and probably never has been one of 
terrorist-inspired insurgency in an area which was entirely 
peaceful till the mid-eighties, presumably because such a stance 
will bring into focus Pakistan's clandestine role both in 
Kashmir and Punjab. Instead, the United States is bent on 
describing what is happening in the valley as an intensifying 
civil strife in which the Indian security forces are supposedly 
acting like an occupation army while an innocent Islamabad is 
merely standing on the sidelines, wringing its hands in despair 
about the plight of Muslims in the state. 
  There is no appreciation in this blinkered view of 
Pakistan's 
earlier futile forays into the state, the threats, including one 
of a nuclear confrontation, that its leaders have been issuing 
about making India atone for the sins of liberating Bangladesh 
and of the treatment of minorities in Pakistan, compared with 
India's incomparably better record. If anything is clear from 
this inexplicably partisan attitude, it is that the United 
States cannot hope to act as a "catalyst," as it claims it wants 
to do, to promote better India-Pakistan relations. All that it 
can achieve through its tilt reminiscent of the Nixon-Kissinger 
period towards a country it was on the verge of declaring a 
terrorist state not long ago is to cause widespread dismay and 
disillusionment in India. Such feelings will be all the greater 
because the American stand is liable to be seen not as an 
expression of naivete, but as a cynical ploy to put pressure on 
India if only because the latter is recognised as far too 
independent-minded and dismissive of global American strategies. 
Clearly, the resentment in the American establishment about 
India's role as a leader of the nonaligned movement persists 
despite the total transformation of the international scene. 
Until now, India's open society had dissuaded the United States 
from complaining about human rights violations, but the 
unfortunate situation in Kashmir has given it an opportunity 
which it is seemingly loath to miss even if it means turning a 
blind eye to Pakistan's more blatant transgressions. In the 
process, it is again siding with elements in Pakistan that are 
basically inimical to democracy.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Softens Tone on India"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 10--The Clinton administration may 
not initiate any substantive change in its policy towards India, 
but a more cautious and gentler tone is evident. Apparently 
there is a recognition of the buffeting that Indo-U.S. relations 
have taken in the recent months, and the need to provide a 
better balance in the articulation of policy towards India. 
  In the new perspective, the emphasis on the economic 
imperative is a little more pronounced than in the recent past. 
The differences on Kashmir, human rights and non-proliferation 
remain, but there is a stress on the positive elements of the 
relationship as well. 
  The Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, 
Ms. 
Robin Raphel, went to some length yesterday to correct the 
impression that Indo-U.S. relations "have soured because of 
public disagreements over such issues as Kashmir." Speaking to 
the Asia Society here, Ms. Raphel stated that the "reality is 
much different," and "the fabric of our relations extends much 
beyond disagreements we may have." 
  She referred to close cooperation in education, culture, 
science and technology, besides the rapidly growing commercial 
relationship. Ms. Raphel regretted that while the differences 
get most of the media attention, there is a vast positive effort 
to improve the relations that remains outside the spotlight. 
  In an important assessment, Ms. Raphel noted that expanding 
Indo-U.S. economic relations could be the "harbinger of further 
growth throughout the region." Suggesting that the rapid 
economic integration of South Asia with the world will encourage 
deeper involvement of American business, generate prosperity and 
provide a better market for U.S. goods. "Everybody will win" in 
the process, she asserted. 
  Balanced perspective: On the nuclear issue, too, 
Ms. Raphel, presented a balanced perspective. Accepting that 
both India and Pakistan are "nuclear capable," she noted that 
there are "large constituencies" in both countries who believe 
that nuclear capability is indispensable to their national 
security. 
  The United States, according to Ms. Raphel, must "also 
recognise the importance of outside factors--concerns about 
China, Central Asia and Russia--in the South Asian security 
equation." She asserted, however, that the United States must 
convince the two countries that nuclear weapons make the 
sub-continent a "more dangerous and unstable neighbourhood." The 
United States must make this case "honestly and without 
discounting the security perceptions of each side," Ms. Raphel 
stated. She expressed the intention to work closely with India 
and Pakistan to "reduce tensions and enhance confidence." 
  "The United States remains in favour of a multilateral 
process to promote arms control, non-proliferation and regional 
security," she said adding that India and Pakistan "already 
accept the multilateral approach in principle," only details had 
to be worked out. The U.S. emphasis on a multilateral approach 
is a clear vindication of the Indian position that 
non-proliferation cannot be addressed in a limited South Asian 
framework. It is also clear that the Pakistani proposal for a 
five-power conference on nuclear proliferation is now dead. 
  Less focus on human rights: Whether she meant it 
or not, human rights and Kashmir came lower down in Ms. Raphel's 
listing of American priorities in South Asia, after economic 
cooperation, non-proliferation, and curbing narcotics 
trafficking. On human rights, she noted the "long tradition of 
affinity for the ideas of democratic government and respect for 
the rights of the individual." Stating that these "democracies 
and individual rights are in peril," Ms. Raphel called on the 
freely elected governments of South Asia to "effectively provide 
for the present needs and future hopes of their citizens." 
  On Kashmir, Ms. Raphel's comparison of the situation in the 
Kashmir Valley to that in Afghanistan was a bit surprising. 
While asserting that Kashmir and Afghanistan will remain high on 
her agenda for South Asia, Ms. Raphel acknowledged that she is 
"keenly aware of the limits that constrain U.S. policy in both 
conflicts." She reiterated the now-standard formulation of the 
Clinton administration that Kashmir is a disputed territory, and 
called on India and Pakistan to resolve the issue through 
peaceful negotiations, while taking into account--as a practical 
matter--the wishes of the Kashmiri people. 
  In a representation of the issue in non-offensive terms, Ms. 
Raphel said the United States regards India and Pakistan as good 
friends who "remain trapped in what appears to be a zero-sum 
game." "We would like to see them escape the tortured history of 
the conflict and deal with the problem based on the situation in 
Kashmir today." She also noted that the current American 
approach seems "doomed to be interpreted by one side or the 
other as a tilt." 
  In her survey of the broader trends in the region, she noted 
that the forces of moderation had triumphed in South Asia, 
despite the recent fears to be contrary. She acknowledged the 
valuable contributions made by India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and 
Nepal to the on-going peacekeeping operations in Somalia, 
Cambodia, Kuwait, Mozambique and elsewhere.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 10--The India Interest Group, set 
up by the U.S. business community at the initiative of General 
Electric, an American firm, is preparing a scheme to improve 
Indo-U.S. ties. 
  In a "statement of purpose" issued on Tuesday, the India 
Interest Group identified three major objectives. One, "to 
support further liberalisation" of India's trade and investment 
policies. Two, to help "raise the visibility" of Indo-U.S. 
relations with "policy and decision-makers in Washington." 
Three, to promote a two-way dialogue between the American 
private sector and leading members of the Indian Government and 
the Indian Business community. 
  This is an informal group of U.S. companies which have a 
"special interest" in issues affecting India in Washington. 
  The current members in the group set up in December 1993 
include, American Express, American President Lines, AT &amp; T, 
Bechtel Group, Black Veatch International, Citibank, Coca Cola, 
Digital Equipment, Enron, FMC, Ford, General Electric, IBM, 
International Equity Partners, Kellogg, Morgan Stanley, 
Raytheon, Unisys, U.S. West, and Woodward Governor Co. 
  The group in Washington has the active support of the 
confederation of Indian Industry and the Indian Ambassador, Mr. 
Siddhartha Shankar Ray. 
  An interface: The India Interest Group is not 
meant to "preempt or displace any existing efforts," but provide 
a mechanism to work with high-level U.S. Government officials, 
and provide "a line of communication" with Indian business and 
senior Government officials "about our common interests" in 
India. 
  On Tuesday night at a working dinner Mr. Ray sought to 
generate interaction between the India Interest Group and the 
India caucus, a group of Congressmen working to promote Indian 
interests in the U.S. Congress. 
  Mr. Michael Gadbaw, vice-president and senior counsel of 
General Electric referred to the importance of India in the 
company's strategy of globalisation. He called on Washington to 
understand the nature of changes in India and stated that 
"commercial interests would need to be increasingly taken into 
account in the policymaking process as far as India was 
concerned." 
  Declaring that India Interest Group was "extremely bullish 
on 
India," Mr. Gadbaw called on New Delhi to create greater 
transparency and speed in investment approval process, 
accelerate the enunciation of exit policy and promote 
development of infrastructure in power, transportation and 
telecommunications. 
  Mr. Frank Pallone, the Congressman from New Jersey, who 
heads 
the India caucus called for formulation of specific ideas and 
projects to promote economic ties between the two countries.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 11--India today took a serious view 
of the reported statement of a senior U.S. official, equating 
the situation in Kashmir with the civil war in Afghanistan, and 
asserted "we will not brook any interference by any country in 
our internal affairs," reports UNI. 
  Reacting to the recent speech of Ms Robin Raphel, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, in 
Washington, an official spokesman in a strongly-worded statement 
said such references "tend to provide encouragement to Pakistan 
and terrorists sustained by them to continue with their violent 
activities" in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  He asserted that "no comparison can be drawn between the 
situation in Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir." 
  He said the situation in Afghanistan was a by-product of the 
cold war whereas Jammu and Kashmir had been facing a massive 
campaign of terrorism aided and abetted by Pakistan. "The only 
link between Afghanistan and Jammu and Kashmir is that weapons 
and mercenaries have moved from both Afghanistan and Pakistan 
in support of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir." 
  The spokesman said such references by U.S. officials were 
"unhelpful and hinder resumption of the democratic political 
process and a return to normalcy (in Jammu and Kashmir) which 
the Government of India is striving to bring about."

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Having decided to recast Czech 
Republic's command economy along market principles, its 
President, Dr. Vaclav Havel, today began a forceful bid to 
collaborate with Indian business enterprises. 
  "I am proud to be able to present to you the Czech Republic 
as a stable democratic State with a rapidly advancing market 
economy," Dr. Havel said at a banquet hosted in his honour, by 
his counterpart, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma. 
  Among a variety of issues, Kashmir figured prominently 
during 
talks which the visiting dignitary held with the Minister of 
State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia. 
  The first head of the Czech Republic to visit India, after 
Czechoslovakia was partitioned last year, Dr. Havel, during his 
six-day stay, will be conferred with the Indira Gandhi Prize for 
Peace, Disarmament and Development for 1993. 
  Ideal solution for Kashmir issue: In the backdrop 
of India's refusal to the Pakistani bid for external 
intervention on Kashmir, Dr. Havel said it was "unnecessary for 
one side to internationalise the issue." Aware of what he 
described as a "complicated issue" (Czechoslovakia was a member 
of the UN Commission on India and Pakistan soon after its 
appointment), Dr. Havel said Kashmir's solution lay in a 
"peaceful bilateral dialogue." 
  Citing a precedent which saw India and Pakistan signing an 
agreement, he advocated that an "ideal solution lay in a 
peaceful negotiation as was done before at Shimla." 
  Hoping to see the Czech Republic supporting India's campaign 
to make the U.N. more representative, Mr. Bhatia discussed 
'restructuring' the U.N. system with Dr. Havel. Expansion of the 
15-nation Security Council is high on India's agenda. 
  With Dr. Havel offering India better economic opportunities 
following market reforms by Prague, economic relations between 
the republics could well be on the upswing. Sharing Dr. Havel's 
optimism during talks this morning, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma 
hoped "the two countries will work together for mutual benefit 
in the fields of economic cooperation, commerce and trade." 
  In the wake of this political nod, a meeting between 
industrialists with the Czech Minister of Finance, Mr. Ivan 
Kocarnic, yielded the possibility of India investing in the 
Czech republic in sectors including steel, heavy engineering, 
computer software, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, consumer goods, 
ceramics and textiles. Referring to the potential economic 
advantages, Mr. Kocarnic told Indian businessmen that nearly 60 
per cent of the Czech industry was now in private hands. 
  Apprising entrepreneurs that the former east bloc power 
house 
was not `Euro-centric', he said that nearly 60 per cent of 
exports to Western Europe finally ended in Asian markets. Before 
its partition, Czechoslovakia was also a supplier of key defence 
equipment for the Indian arsenal. Heavy vehicles and small arms 
were among a variety of equipment churned out by Czechoslovakian 
factories which ended up in Indian defence stores.

<F P=106> [Article by Shikha Bose: "Havel Refuses To Comment on J&amp;K </F>
[Jammu &amp; Kashmir)"] 
  [Text] Calcutta, February 10--The Czech President, Mr. 
Vaclav Havel, carefully distinguished his personal stand from 
the political stand of his government on the issue of Kashmir, 
in an interview with TOINS here today. 
  The genesis of the Kashmir problem is rooted in its history 
and the events of the last 40 years. It is a complex problem, 
which the Czech republic is observing from the outside, he said. 
  He clarified that this was the political stand of his 
government. Mr Havel said that he could not offer any personal 
views on Kashmir and the allegations of human rights violations, 
since he had not been to the state to personally see the 
realities. 
  If he had the time and the opportunity to visit Kashmir and 
see things for himself it would be possible to make an 
assessment of the validity or otherwise of international 
accusations against India of human rights violations in the 
valley. 
  The official position of the Czech republic on Kashmir is 
that the matter is an internal affair of India and Pakistan and 
the problems should be resolved through mutual negotiations on 
the basis of the Shimla agreement of 1972. 
  Playwright, philosopher and dissident-turned-establishment 
politician, the Czech President chafes under the burden of 
office. He confessed that the most unpleasant part of being a 
head of state was to have to repeat several times over the same 
words at different fora. For a wordsmith, who has described his 
paradox as "I write mercilessly sceptical" pieces, repetition 
must be agony. The demands on his time to perform public duties 
eats into his pursuit of art. Mr Havel said that writing had 
become a victim of his political career. 
  While the horrors of "criminality, hatred among 
nationalities, suspicion, racism, deliberate lying, politicking 
in an unrestrained struggle for purely partisan interests, a 
hunger for power, unadulterated ambition" had receded in the 
Czech republic, the dangers lurked under the surface. These 
spectres were rampant outside the Czech republic, Mr. Havel said. 
  There was xenophobia, fanaticism and violence against which 
the struggle for morality and responsibility and conscience 
would have to be waged. 
  Mr Havel said that there were basic human rights that would 
have to be protected. As head of state, he would use the 
opportunity to further the cause of human rights. The global 
yardstick for human rights would have to be forged out of the 
inherent truths in every religion, which fundamentalists in 
their own self-interest had perverted to serve their 
fundamentalist cause. These inherent truths which were the 
essence of every religion would have to form the basic 
foundation of a global yardstick for human rights. 
  Mr Havel said the virus of truth was an analogy he had used 
to describe the dissident movement against the totalitarian 
regime in former Czechoslovakia. Battling ethnic conflict and 
violence generated by hatred between nationalities required a 
different remedy. Truth was weak against the accumulated 
bitterness of ethnic conflict and violence, he said. 
  Mr Havel spent part of the morning visiting Mother Teresa 
and 
handed over a cheque for the Missionaries of Charity. He visited 
the Kalighat temple as well.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 8--India and the Czech Republic have 
decided to work together in the "political sphere" in dealing 
with issues of re-fashioning of the international system in the 
wake of the collapse of the bipolar world, the visiting Czech 
president, Dr. Vaclav Havel, told a crowded press conference 
today shortly after receiving the 1993 Indira Gandhi Prize for 
Peace, Disarmament and Development. 
  During his two-day dialogue with the Indian leadership, the 
distinguished visitor--a well-known playwright, original thinker 
and statesman--met the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the 
Vice-President, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, and the Prime Minister [PM], 
Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao. 
  He made a point of telling the media that he had arrived 
here 
with the Czech Government's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance 
Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Minister for Trade. 
  In the course of his "extensive discussions" with the Indian 
leaders, the two countries decided to continue with the 
traditional friendship that existed between India and the former 
Czechoslovakia, Dr. Havel said. 
  Global and bilateral questions were also discussed. The two 
countries already have in place an agreement on trade and on 
avoidance of double taxation, and are working on agreements on 
protection of investment, as well as culture. The one on 
protecting investments was seen as especially important, as the 
Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Ivan Kocharnek, Dr. Havel noted that 
a Czech firm, the Skoda Exports, was executing a "major 
pipeline" in India. This constitutes the single biggest Czech 
investment in this country. 
  On the possibility of the continuance of cooperation in the 
field of defence between India and the Czech republic as was the 
case with the old Czechoslovakia, Dr. Havel said his country had 
a fairly advanced armaments industry in some fields and was not 
inclined to continue defence cooperation as before with some of 
the countries with which communist Czechoslovakia had ties. 
However, this would not be the case with "democratic, peaceful 
countries." There was no reason why the Czech republic should 
not continue exporting armaments to India, he added. 
  Answering another question, the visiting dignitary said, 
"All 
the fundamentalists in the world should be locked up in a room 
together after being disarmed, and should preferably not be 
supplied any food. That would perhaps produce the best result." 
  In response to a question relating to human rights and the 
former Soviet Union, Dr. Havel said a "global minimum 
understanding on political metaculture" could serve as a basis 
for global cooperation. This should include the protection of 
human and civil rights. He hoped that soon Russia would have no 
need for any dictators, "even enlightened dictators." 
  PM to visit Prague: Dr. Havel said he had a "very 
intensive, warm and friendly" meeting with Mr. Rao who has been 
extended an invitation to visit Prague. The invitation has been 
accepted. 
  The visiting President announced that of the prize money he 
had received, some would go to a home for handicapped children 
as promised by his wife earlier in the day, $10,000 would be 
given to Mother Teresa's mission, and equal amounts to the 
Ramakrishna Mission and for the Dalai Lama's "village." The 
remaining would go to a Foundation for the benefit of the Prague 
Castle. 
  In the capital, Dr. Havel saw the Qutb Minar and Humayun's 
tomb, and is headed for Sarnath and Calcutta before returning 
home. He told newsmen. "One day I would love to come here as a 
tourist, spend a month, and not move in official motorcades.

  [Text] Bonn, February 3--The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut 
Kohl, today assured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
that his country would do everything in its power to boost 
industrial and technological co-operation with India and 
announced that a high-level Indo-German commission on science 
and technology would be set up soon, report PTI and UNI. 
  Addressing the Indo-German economic conference along with Mr 
Rao, the German Chancellor said India's economic development was 
on the "right course" and acknowledged that there was scope for 
further increasing German investments in India. 
  Mr Rao, declaring there was "absolutely no hesitation or 
dilution in the commitment to liberalisation," urged German 
industrialists to take "one more determined step" to increase 
the flow of investments, in view of the "ideal opportunity" 
provided by the reforms process in India. 
  The Prime Minister assured both Indian and German 
industrialists at the conference that he and Dr Kohl would solve 
"any problem, if it comes to our level." 
  The two leaders told the delegates that both India and 
Germany were aware of the vast and untapped potential for 
further deepening and strengthening bilateral economic relations. 
  The federal government and German industry were following 
India's policy of reforms with close attention and sympathy and 
"modern India, with its reform-oriented economic policy aimed at 
liberalisation, is one of our most important partners on the 
Asian continent," the German leader told Mr Rao. 
  Mr Rao said further liberalisation to cover some more items 
was on the anvil. The items to be liberalised were those which 
one could think of, he said and added that he could not say a 
syllable more because the Union budget was only three weeks away. 
  Mr Rao welcomed the Asia offensive of the German 
industrialists who are increasingly turning towards the 
Asia-Pacific region for investments. India, Japan and China have 
been identified as major thrust areas by the newly-launched 
Asia-Pacific Association (APA). 
  In his observations, the president of the Confederation of 
Indian Industry (CII), Mr Jamshed N. Godrej, announced the 
signing of a memorandum of understanding between CII and BDI 
(the German federation of industry). 
  Mr Godrej said India, Germany and Singapore could enter into 
trilateral partnership to exploit the complimentaries and 
individual advantages in areas of skilled manpower, technology 
and industrial sophistication. 
  Meanwhile, Germany has told India that it would continue to 
adopt a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and avoid making any 
value judgment in the matter. 
  The issue figured prominently during the talks Mr Rao had 
with German leaders, during which he voiced serious concern over 
the problems his country faced with regard to Pakistan's aid to 
terrorists in the Indian border states of Jammu and Kashmir and 
Punjab. 
  The issue also figured during the foreign secretary-level 
talks where the Indian foreign secretary, Mr K. Srinivasan, 
briefed his German counterpart on the outcome of the recent 
foreign secretary level talks in Islamabad and the subsequent 
six proposals mooted by New Delhi." 
  Germany urged India to sign the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty (NPT), which New Delhi has refused to comply with, 
arguing that the existing global non-proliferation regimes were 
discriminatory against the developing countries. 
  The German Chancellor reiterated his strong commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation which he has been consistently and 
resolutely pursuing at all international fora. 
  The German leader told Mr Rao that strengthening the 
existing 
global non-proliferation regimes must take "absolute priority" 
and reiterated his government's resolve for an indefinite 
unconditional extension of the NPT in 1995. 
  The two countries have been engaged in a comprehensive 
dialogue on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and other 
political matters of mutual concept at the foreign office-level 
talks for quite some time. The two sides have already held three 
rounds and the fourth round is due to commence shortly. 
  Three high-level ministerial delegations from Germany will 
visit India in the first half of the current year. 
  An official spokesman today said these high-level visits, 
which will follow Mr Rao's current visit, were in line with 
Germany's "new-look" Asia concept unfolded by the Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl. 
  The spokesman said the German development co-operation 
minister would visit India next month, followed by the visit of 
the German economic co-operation minister in April. 
  The German vice-chancellor and foreign affairs minister, Mr 
Klaus Kinkel, is expected to come in May. 
  The new German perception was that it had put too many eggs 
in the European basket. It now wanted to expand its influence in 
Asia as well and had identified India, Japan and China for 
cementing ties, the spokesman said. 
  Mr Rao's visit, his second to Germany in less than three 
years, was extremely important because Germany had already 
declared India "a partner of choice in Asia." Germany had also 
described its relationship with India as a "strategic" one. 
  Germany, Europe's number one and the world's third largest 
economy, till recently used to be the second largest investor in 
India, after the United States, but had gone down to the tenth 
position after 1990. 
  However, trade volume between India and Germany had been 
growing steadily and touched nearly 5.5 billion Deutsche Mark 
(DM) in 1992. It was anticipated to cross the DM 6 billion mark 
in the current financial year. 
  Indian exports to Germany have been getting more and more 
sophisticated and diversified.

<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "Germany Will Stay Neutral on </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 3--India has conveyed to the German 
Government the latest position in the bilateral talks with 
Pakistan at the Foreign Secretary level, held in Islamabad this 
January and the follow-up in terms of exchange of "Non-papers." 
  At Germany's request, India has given a summary of the 
discussions that took place. Also handed over are copies of two 
non-papers presented by Pakistan, including the one on 
plebiscite in Kashmir, which were subsequently rejected by 
India, and the six Indian proposals pertaining to 
confidence-building measures aimed at improving bilateral 
relations. 
  These documents were handed over during the Foreign 
Secretary-level discussions here on Wednesday. The Indian side 
was led by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, who 
flew into Bonn to be part of the Prime Ministerial delegation. 
Wednesday's discussions were the fourth in a series of talks 
structured by India and Germany for closer political contacts. 
The earlier three rounds were conducted by the then Foreign 
Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and his predecessor, Mr. Muchkund 
Dubey. 
  Though maintaining a neutral stance on Kashmir and 
Indo-Pakistan relations in general, Germany is interested in 
seeing an early resolution of the problem and improvement in 
ties between Delhi and Islamabad. The same dilemma confronts 
Germany over Pakistan's strident propaganda against India on the 
question of alleged human rights abuses. 
  The talks here took notice of the shrill speech by the 
Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, at the Human Rights 
Conference in Geneva on Tuesday, when India conveyed its 
displeasure at the Pakistani move to try and get a resolution 
passed against it. The Indian side has conveyed to Germany what 
New Delhi's attitude would be if the resolution is indeed moved 
and the consequences. 
  In response, Germany, typically, remained non-committal, 
saying it was neutral on the issue and added that moving such a 
resolution would not help in improving Indo-Pakistan bilateral 
relations. 
  The other matter that came up for discussion pertained to 
the 
restructuring of the United Nations. Germany already filed 
papers for election as a non-permanent member in the Security 
Council and solicited Indian support. India kept its options 
open, saying many others had filed papers and a final decision 
on supporting a particular country would be taken later. The 
decision would, of course, depend on the status of India's 
bilateral relations with the contending countries, it was said. 
  Strategic alliance: According to observers, the 
significance of the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's visit to 
this country twice within a short span of two years is part of a 
strategic alliance India and Germany want to form. While trade 
and economic exchanges are in the forefront of such an alliance, 
the political aspect is equally significant. 
  India, on the other hand, is keen on taking advantage of 
Germany's new Asia policy under which it wants to focus on the 
continent with emphasis on China, Japan and India. India, 
therefore, wants closer political contacts with an emerging 
global power as well as one of the key nations of Europe. 
  The idea is to have greater interaction so that Germany will 
have a better perception of the Indian position on various 
thorny issues, including Kashmir and human rights, which are 
being internationalised. The fact that Mr. Kohl in particular 
and Germany in general enjoy a good rapport with the United 
States administration under Mr. Bill Clinton is also taken note 
of. 
  To keep up political contacts, with Germany a series of 
bilateral visits has been planned for the current year, though 
this is year of elections, also involving the offices of 
President and Chancellor, are to be held in Germany. 
  Talks at the level of officials are also on for finalising 
treaties on double taxation avoidance and extradition and a 
bilateral agreement for investment guarantee.

  [Text] Bonn, February 4--The Indian government is 
"seriously considering" doing away with the situation that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category, 
as part of ongoing liberalisation process, UNI reports. 
  This has been conveyed by the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, in the Indian government's reply to the "Kohl 
memorandum" sent to New Delhi after the German Chancellor, Dr 
Helmut Kohl's visit to India in February last year. 
  The memorandum, entitled `Proposals on Economic Policies and 
Procedures of the Government of India', was forwarded by the 
Chancellor in July last year. 
  Some of the other proposals for further liberalisation, made 
in the memorandum and under active consideration of the 
government, are: 
  --Liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry; 
  --Removal of the phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy; 
  --Increasing the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations; 
  --Amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act. 
  The government's reply to the memorandum also states that on 
some other issues, such as enforceability of foreign awards, the 
government had an "open mind" and was willing to consider the 
matter. 
  The Indian reply to the memorandum was given to the German 
government a few days before Mr Rao's arrival on a state visit 
here. 
  The Indian reply states that it must be appreciated as a 
fundamental point relating to the issues raised in the "Kohl 
memorandum" that since the process of reforms was initiated 
several policy changes had been progressively made and 
procedures increasingly streamlined to improve the business 
environment in the country. 
  The reply adds that several of the proposals made in the 
memorandum were already under implementation. They were 
identified as: 
  --To decrease the number of industries reserved for the 
public sector; 
  --Faster clearance for applications under the EPCG [Export 
Promotion Capital Goods] scheme; 
  --Negotiation of more favourable double-taxation agreement; 
  --More liberal procedures for payment of foreign 
technicians; 
  --Long duration purchase agreements for power and secured 
fuel supplies for such projects; 
  --Equal opportunities for manufacturers in the telecom 
sector. 
  Under six broad classifications, the memorandum put forward 
suggestions on a vast range of areas and subjects such as 
desirability of a "negative" list; speeding up of state 
governments' proposals; uniform industrial policy in the states; 
remittance facilities for foreign nationals; disinvestment 
procedures; and governing law and arbitration for contracts 
entered into with foreign parties. 
  PTI adds: Leading political parties in Germany 
have assured India that the new `Asia concept' unveiled by the 
Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, with India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation and embracing a wide range of 
fields, would be honoured irrespective of which party came to 
power in this year's elections there. 
  This assurance was conveyed to Mr Rao, when a series of 
important German political leaders called on him here yesterday. 
  An official spokesman said that by and large there was "a 
multi-party support" to Dr Kohl's new `Asia concept', as Germany 
has willingly recognised that Japan, China and India in Asia 
would be the important political and economic powers in the 
coming years. 
  The important German leaders who called on Mr Rao included 
Mr 
Hans Ulrich Klose, chairman of the parliamentary group of 
Socialist Democratic Party, Dr Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Party, and 
Dr Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of Free Democratic Party. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Rao reached the historic city of Berlin this 
afternoon on the last leg of his six-day tour to Davos and 
Germany. 
  Mr Rao is scheduled to meet the German President, Mr Richard 
von Weizsaecker, besides opening the cultural festival programme 
at the Indian cultural centre there tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by Alok Mukherjee: "India, A Priority Area for </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 4--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today began the last leg of his Germany visit. 
Flying into Berlin from Bonn in a German Government plane, the 
Prime Minister's major programme for the day was a meeting with 
the German President, Mr. Richard von Weizsacker. Mr Rao also 
had a luncheon meeting with eminent Indologists here, when a 
number of issues to facilitate studies on India were brought to 
the notice of the Prime Minister. 
  With Mr. Weizsacker, the discussions were general in nature, 
it being basically a courtesy call. The German President is well 
acquainted with India, having been there in 1991. Mr. Weizsacker 
was in India at the height of its political crisis when the 
minority Chandra Shekar Government was in power and its 
continuance in office was under doubt. This aspect was 
highlighted by the German authorities on many occasions as a 
measure of their commitment to maintain high political relations 
with India, irrespective of the Government in power. 
  In fact, the importance that Germany attaches to India has 
been confirmed to the Prime Minister not only by the present 
Government in Bonn, but by the host of Opposition leaders as 
well, who called on Mr. Rao during his two-day stay in Bonn. 
<H5>  `Asia policy' </H5>
  The leaders of the coalition parties in the present 
Government, as well as those from other political parties, have 
also told Mr. Rao that the new "Asia policy" of Germany had a 
national consensus and would be pursued by any Government that 
comes to power after the federal elections in October this year. 
The "Asia policy" of Germany focuses on the entire Asian region 
as the priority area for trade and economic concentration as 
well as for high political contacts. Almost all the countries of 
Asia have been included in the priority list, including India 
and Pakistan, but three countries have been identified for 
intensive co-operation--China, Japan and India. 
  Parallel meetings conducted by the members of the Prime 
Ministerial delegation had also indicated that the German 
Government has sent out the signal to its industrialists that 
India is now a priority area for investment and that 
concentration should begin. The process has been facilitated by 
the fact that just a few days before Mr. Rao's visit, the 
Government of India relied to a detailed memorandum that was 
submitted by the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, after his 
return from India in February last year. This memorandum listed 
out the various irritants that were obstructing German 
investment in India and the response of the Government of India 
had been sought to the points raised. 
  The proposals submitted by the Germans were broadly divided 
into six categories covering the financial sector, the 
pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the power sector, 
telecommunications, air traffic and general issues. The Indian 
response too has been fairly detailed with areas listed out 
where decisions have already been taken. The pending areas 
include liberalisation of the pharmaceutical and chemical 
industry, removal of phased manufacturing programme obligations 
for units established prior to the new industrial policy, 
increase in the prescribed payment limits for automatic 
approvals of technical collaborations, amendments to the 
Industrial Disputes Act and removal of the condition that 
foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange requirement for 
import of capital goods under the automatic approval category. 
  The Government has also indicated that it is not in a 
position to agree to the suggestion for a negative list of 
imports, an uniform industrial policy in all the States, 
abolition of octroi and automatic adoption of environmental 
standards prescribed in advanced countries. 
<H5>  Joint Ventures </H5>
  Individual interactions between the Prime Minister and chief 
executive officesr of multinational corporations too have 
confirmed that German industry was now positive about investment 
in India. For instance, the representative of Mercedes Benz said 
that a passenger car project was being finalised with the Tata 
group which would make the project one of the major investments 
by Benz in India. Similarly, the Siemens group will be setting 
up two power projects in India--one at Jayamkondan with a 
capacity of 1,500 MW [megawatts] and another at Gandhar of 600 
MW capacity. Another multinational, BASF is setting up a 
chemicals factory in Mangalore for the manufacture of dyestuff.

  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 5--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today defended his sweeping economic reforms, 
describing it as an idealistic striving tempered by practical 
thinking to ameliorate the lot of millions of Indians. 
  Delivering a lecture at the historic Humboldt University 
here, Mr. Rao drew parallel with the renowned indologist, Max 
Mueller who encountered hurdles when he set out to translate 
vedic hymns as his detractors and Mueller was embarking on a 
task for the next century. 
  Mr. Rao recalled the words of Mueller when he said in 
defence 
of his task: "No one feels this more strongly than I do. No one 
has been more willing to make even a beginning in this arduous 
undertaking. Yet a beginning has to be made and we have to 
advance step by step to make a breach in that apparently 
impregnable fortress. My principle, therefore, has always been, 
let us translate what we can, and thus reduce the untranslatable 
portion to narrower and narrower limits." 
  Mr. Rao said in that endeavour, the restriction of the 
untranslatable with limits defined more and more sharply, the 
politician had no less difficult a task than a writer or scholar. 
  In all that the politician or statesman did, his efforts 
must 
be to make the improbable possible, and to persuade his people, 
his adversaries and his friends, and above all himself that the 
impossible would so remain but need not affect, abridge or 
inhibit the immense possibilities that yearn to be realised. Mr. 
Rao asserted in an obvious answer to his detractors. 
  The Prime Minister said currently India was passing through 
the most important transition in its economy as the policies of 
the last 45 years were being re-oriented and efforts were on to 
accomplish a market-led economy. 
  'Walls of prejudice must go': Mr. Rao described 
Berlin as a city "marbled in history and shaped by the ecstasy 
of achievement and the anguish of war where walls have been 
raised and walls have been razed." He said walls of ideology had 
made many intellectual endeavours counter-productive and 
asserted that "we have arrived at a time when truly, the walls 
of biases, of prejudice, of small identities have to be broken, 
to create a new humanism based on the absolute trust and respect 
for the other." 
  Though schools of German studies in India were younger in 
comparison, there was nonetheless, a strong and vibrant 
tradition of German studies in India, he said. He also lauded 
the historic role played by Humboldt University in strengthening 
ties between India and Germany. 
  Mr. Rao said the establishment of the Indian cultural centre 
here would promote the larger cause of Indo-German friendship. 
  Earlier inaugurating the centre by lighting the traditional 
lamp, he said its establishment would provide a focal point for 
interaction between India and Germany in various aspects of 
"Indian art and culture." 
  Rare honour for PM: Mr. Rao was accorded the rare 
honour of being received by federal President, Mr. Richard Von 
Weizsacker, in Berlin instead of Bonn when he called on him last 
evening. 
  This is of great significance especially as Mr. Rao is the 
first Head of Government since World War II to be received by 
the federal President in Berlin. For the people of Berlin too, 
it is a confirmation of the fact that the city will soon become 
the capital of the reunited Germany as it was agreed upon by a 
parliamentary decision immediately following the reunification. 
  An official spokesman described Mr. Rao's meeting with Mr. 
Weizsacker at Bellevue Palace as a courtesy call. Later in the 
evening, Mr. Rao walked through the Brandenburg Gate with the 
governing Mayor of Berlin, Mr. Ederhard Diepgen.--PTI

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 6--On the completion of the 
week-long foreign visit to Switzerland and Germany, the Prime 
Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned home today, highly 
satisfied with the interactions with political and business 
leaders. 
  Declining to address the customary on-board conference on 
his 
special aircraft, Mr. Rao just told presspersons in his 
delegation that "you have seen how the visit went off. I don't 
think I have anything more to add." 
  The task of elaborating on the Prime Minister's successful 
trip was left to the top officials who accompanied him, 
including his Principal Secretary, Mr. A.N. Verma, the Finance 
Secretary, Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the Foreign Secretary, 
Mr. K. Srinivasan. These officials drew attention to some of the 
significant aspects of the Prime Ministerial visit both in terms 
of economic and political content. 
  On the economic front, there were two factors which emerged 
from the visit. In Davos for instance, Mr. Rao chose the 
gathering of world business leaders to clarify India's position 
that it would go along on the path of economic reforms, but 
would choose its own pace and direction. 
<H5>  Pressure Resisted </H5>
  The insistent pressure on India to speed up the reforms 
process has been resisted by the assertion that the country 
would not blindly follow the prescriptions laid down by "people 
sitting thousands of miles away, but would instead choose its 
own model of development, suited to its genius and 
circumstances." In other words, potential foreign investors have 
been assured of the Government's commitment to the reforms 
process but with the caution that all their demands would not be 
met. 
  "There is a standard check-list with these people before 
they 
take investment decisions. Has the country de-regulated; has it 
lowered tariff barriers; has it privatised (meaning the public 
sector); has it liberalised labour laws, etc. We have said "Yes" 
to some of these points and "No" to the others. That is our 
position and it has been made clear to the investors what to 
expect from India," a senior official said. 
  That the Indian official position this year could be 
different from what it was in 1992--the Prime Minister's first 
visit to Davos--is obviously based on the stronger economic 
position today. With foreign exchange reserves of over $10 
billions, with a large number of proposals for foreign direct 
investment being cleared and with buoyant foreign institutional 
investment in the stock markets, India could afford to take a 
stronger stand at Davos this time, the official added. This 
strong economic position is reinforced by the fact that India is 
now definitely on the "investment radar screen" of most 
industrial groups, particularly with the collapse of the 
expectations that had arisen with the changes in eastern Europe 
two years ago. 
  "The euphoria about Russia is over. The other markets don't 
show much prospects. The Asian region and India are the few 
bright spots for investors and most of them are aware that they 
should be in India in the medium term. This is the message we 
got in Davos," the official added. 
<H5>  Industry, Government Mix </H5>
  The second important development of the Prime Ministerial 
visit is the new relationship established between Government and 
industry. This was evident not only in Davos but also in Germany 
where the inter-mixing of the official and industrial delegation 
was so much that the entire entourage of industrial leaders 
practically became part of the Prime Minister's delegation. 
  The meeting between Indian and German industrialists in Bonn 
was held in the office of the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut 
Kohl. "This is unprecedented. Never has the NATO [North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation] room of the Chancellor's office been thrown 
open for an industrial meet," the Indian Ambassador in Bonn, Mr. 
K.S. Rana, pointed out. The second point to note was that at 
this meeting, where Mr. Rao and Mr. Kohl were present, the top 
bureaucrats of the Government of India literally took a back 
seat and were seated behind the Indian industrial delegation. 
"This too has never happened before. Imagine the Finance 
Secretary sitting behind an industrialist," one official pointed 
out. 
  "The industrialists were given the signal that they were as 
much important in selling India as an investment destination as 
the Government. This close relationship between Government and 
industry is a new development, unlike in the past when 
officialdom maintained a distance from industry," the official 
said. 
<H5>  Politically Significant </H5>
  On the political front too, Mr. Rao's second visit to 
Germany 
in a little over two years is of much significance. As is known, 
this is an election year in Germany, including that for the 
Federal Chancellery and going by indications available now, Mr. 
Kohl faces an extremely difficult task in getting re-elected. 
His bane has been the economy, which has come under severe 
pressure with the unification of West and East Germany, an 
achievement for which Mr. Kohl had taken the entire credit in 
the past. 
  Today, there is over 10 per cent unemployment in the 
country, 
the economy is expected to grow at zero per cent and interest 
rates are too high for fresh investment. In short, the economy 
is in recession and is burdened by the continuing cost of 
reconstruction of the eastern parts. 
  Mr. Rao's singular political achievement with this visit has 
been the establishment of a rapport with the entire political 
spectrum in Germany. The packed schedule that the Prime Minister 
had in Bonn was marked for the more meetings he had with 
Opposition political leaders against the one meeting with Mr. 
Kohl. Moreover, the message that Mr. Rao got from these meetings 
was that India would continue to be a priority area for Germany, 
irrespective of the Government that comes to office after the 
October elections. 
  "The Asia Policy of Mr. Kohl has national support and this 
has been confirmed by the political leaders who met the Prime 
Minister. Thus, India would remain a partner of choice and the 
strategic partnership between the two countries would remain 
unaltered even with political changes in Germany. This assurance 
has been received by India," another top official in the Prime 
Ministerial entourage said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 14--Germany today extended 
development assistance comprising loans and grants of Rs 760.4 
crores [rupees] (roughly DM 380.2 [Deutsche mark] million) to 
India for various ongoing developmental schemes, reports PTI. 
  An inter-governmental agreement to this effect was signed by 
the visiting federal minister for economic co-operation and 
development, Dr Carl-Dieter Spranger, and the Union finance 
minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. 
  Under the agreement, German government would provide loans 
of 
an amount of DM 230.2 million and grants of DM 150 million, 
totalling DM 380.2 million (Rs 760.4 crores). 
  The German grants would cover a primary health project in 
Maharashtra, low-cost house-building programme of HUDCO [Housing 
and Urban Development Corporation], rural water supply expansion 
plan in Rajasthan and erosion control project in Maharashtra, an 
official release said. 
  The loans are highly concessionals and carry an interest of 
0.75 per cent per annum repayable over the period of 40 years 
including a moratorium of ten years. 
  The details of the loan components include a loan of DM 
27.03 
million for the modernisation of Rourkela Steel Works, a loan of 
DM 37.70 million, for the expansion of the Neyveli lignite 
opencast mining project, a loan of DM 30 million to be made 
available to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development (NABARD) to finance a programme for the promotion of 
rural small-scale business and a loan of DM 60 million to meet 
foreign exchange costs resulting from the purchase of 
fertilisers from Germany. 
  Other schemes covering the loan components include a loan of 
DM 60 million to be used to co-finance a financial 
sector-related adjustment programme and a loan of DM 15.20 
million to the SIDBI for its lending schemes to small scale 
industries. 
  Grant amount of DM 150 million covers a financial grant of 
DM 
20 million for a primary health project in Maharashtra, a 
financial grant of DM 15 million for a social marketing plan, a 
financial grant of DM 35 million for a low-cost house-building 
programmes for lower income groups (HUDCO), a financial grant of 
DM 55 million for the expansion of project rural water supply in 
Rajasthan and a financial grant of DM 25 million for the 
expansion of the erosion control project in Maharashtra. 
  Meanwhile, Dr Manmohan Singh told Dr Spranger that India 
will 
adopt a step by step approach in implementing the reform process 
to ensure that it is durable. 
  Dr Spranger among other subjects discussed issues relating 
to 
bilateral aid policy and foreign investment in infrastructure 
areas like power. He said the National Renewal Fund programme 
was identified as an important element of the reform process. 
  The German minister expressed satisfaction at the signing of 
the Indo-German financial cooperation protocol through which Rs 
760 crores will flow to India and indicated that a new dimension 
to Indo-German co-operation had been added in recent years with 
active partnership at various levels. 
  Dr Spranger said, besides giving aid, Germany was willing to 
assist India in various areas during the implementation of 
economic reforms. 
  Battle tank: Dr Spranger said that his country 
would soon be taking a decision on supplying engines for India's 
main battle tank (MBT) "Arjun" reports TOINS. 
  Addressing a news conference here today, Dr Spranger said 
that there was an intense debate in Germany on supplying engines 
for India's MBT and went on to reveal that the issue had figured 
in discussions during the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao's recent visit to Germany. 
  "A decision on the issue will be taken soon," he said. When 
asked how soon, Dr Spranger replied, "I don't think you will 
have to wait long." 
  The "Arjun" will be required to be powered by the German MTU 
1400 HP diesel engines till such time when India develops an 
indigenous engine for which efforts are continuing. Following 
successful conclusion of the static and dynamic trials that were 
witnessed by the former defence minister, Mr Sharad Pawar, at 
the Hahajan Ranges exactly a year ago, six of this 
state-of-the-art MBT was formally inducted into the Indian army 
on June 14 last year.

<F P=106> [Article by Ambarish Mishra: "German Team To Review </F>
Projects"] 
  [Text] Bombay, February 12--A high-profile delegation from 
the Federal Republic of Germany is on a two-day visit to 
Maharashtra to review the on-going projects of technical 
co-operation between India and Germany. 
  The German minister for economic co-operation and 
development, Mr C.D. Spranger, leads the delegation of top 
officials, technical experts and 20 journalists. 
  Sources said the visit has been prompted by widespread 
criticism in Germany that financial aid to India be reviewed in 
the wake of New Delhi's alleged human rights violations in Jammu 
and Kashmir. Also, the popular opinion in Germany is sharply 
critical of the ruling coalition's aid policy because of acute 
resource crunch at home. Mr Spranger's visit is not only to 
consolidate the economic ties between the two countries, but 
also to publicise the Indo-German works in Maharashtra as proof 
of "good work," said a top Maharashtra government official. 
  The delegation visited Mendhwan and Kasare villages in 
Ahmednagar district yesterday and inspected the watershed 
projects funded by Germany. Maharashtra's agriculture and water 
conservation minister, Mr Harshavardhan Deshmukh and Mr Ashok 
Basak, secretary, water conservation, accompanied the delegation. 
  Under an agreement between India and the Federal Republic of 
Germany, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau offered 
a whopping aid of DM 12 (Rs 216 million) to Maharashtra in 1991 
to develop micro-watersheds in the state, a dream project of Mr 
Sudhakarrao Naik, then chief minister of Maharashtra. The 
National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is 
the Centre's nodal agency which monitors the watershed works in 
close co-operation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
and local villagers. The project aims to support the sustainable 
production systems in drought-prone villages such as Jadgaon in 
Aurangabad, Mendhwan and Kasare in Ahmednagar, Vilvandi in 
Nasik, Upale-Agave in Ratnagiri, Rejani in Yeotmal, Nidhal in 
Satara and Shillimb in Pune. 
  From the aid received from Germany, NABARD provides grants 
for preparing projects and the overhead expenditure, the actual 
work of watershed development and the promotional and training 
activities for the village community as well as the NGO 
activists. 
  Till date, NABARD has received an amount of Rs 20.4 million 
and disbursed grants to the tune of Rs 10.3 million to nine 
village watershed committees and the NGOs. Nine projects are 
underway in different parts of Maharashtra covering an area of 
about 16,022 hectares, it is learnt. 
  The watershed projects have yielded "encouraging" results, 
according to a senior official. "There are visible signs of 
improvement in agriculture production," he added. The project 
villages which previously depended on tankers for the supply of 
drinking water during summer now have a year-round supply of 
well water, thanks to conservation measures. Also, the watershed 
work has resulted in the expansion of rabi areas and a 
remarkable increase in the kharif output. 
  With a marked improvement in the ground-water potential, 
pumping devices and water-saving irrigation equipments such as 
sprinklers and drips are much in demand, particularly for 
raising horticulture crops. In some villages, the community has 
decided to ban free gazing [as printed] and felling of trees 
resulting in the improvement of biomass production. 
  Mendhwan, a major beneficiary of the Indo-German technical 
co-operation, is a classic example of how soil and water 
conservation measures can transform a semi-arid, drought-prone 
area into a self-sufficient village where the agriculture season 
has doubled and villagers have clean drinking water near their 
homes.

<F P=106> [Article by K. K. Katyal: "Arms Spares From Russia Coming"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 8--Three shiploads of spares for the 
defence hardware are arriving from Russia this month, marking a 
breakthrough in the jammed supplies since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union. One ship has already arrived, another is 
expected this week and the third later in the month. 
  This is not the only sign of an upswing in India-Russia 
bilateral relations, the plans for the exchange of visits by the 
top brass being the other. The Russian naval chief, Admiral 
Gromov, is due here soon, while the Chief of the Army Staff, 
Gen. B. C. Joshi, will go to Russia later this month. Russian 
ships will make a call at Bombay in the near future, while the 
plans for joint naval exercises are under way. 
  At the political level too, the warmth and likemindedness, 
evident during the stay here of the Russian President, Mr. Boris 
Yeltsin, remains intact. According to latest indications from 
Moscow, Russia will support New Delhi's stand at the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission at Geneva, where Pakistan plans to move an 
anti-India resolution. The warmth beneath the customary Republic 
Day message from Mr. Yeltsin to the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, 
has not gone unnoticed. "Our two countries are united," said Mr. 
Yeltsin, "not only by the concurrence of the core national 
interest, adherence to democratic objectives but also by the 
invaluable potential of mutual trust and sincere goodwill." 
  The idea of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
visit to Moscow has been seriously mooted but the schedule is 
yet to be finalised. At one stage, the two foreign offices 
proceeded on the assumption of a trip in May--but, now a later 
date is to be fixed, around the middle of the year. 
  The two leaders recently exchanged letters, dealing with 
bilateral issues and the problems of their respective regions. 
Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured in the two 
communications though the precise references are not known 
publicly. According to the Russian embassy sources here, Moscow 
regarded Kashmir an integral part of India and affirmed faith in 
its territorial integrity, considered a "must" not only for the 
region but for the world as a whole. 
  On one issue, however, Russia will need to update its 
position. Mr. Yeltsin's letter, it is learnt, had noted with 
satisfaction Pakistan's decision to give up its plan for an 
anti-India human rights-related resolution at the U.N. That 
phase, however, proved short-lived with Pakistan thinking of an 
identical move at Geneva. On trans-border terrorism, India has 
every reason to draw comfort from the Russian view.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 14--The commander-in-chief of 
the Russian navy, Admiral F. N. Gromov, arrived here today on a 
first-ever visit by a Russian naval chief. 
  The issue of ensuring regular supply of spares for the 
Indian 
navy figures prominently during discussions between the Indian 
and the Russian naval chiefs, at which, matters relating to 
mutual interest and cooperation also figured. 
  As is also true in the case of the Indian air force and the 
army, the Indian navy too has been facing problems in receiving 
regular supply of spare parts. The bulk of the Indian navy, 
about 70 per cent, comprises ships, submarines and other 
equipment from the erstwhile Soviet Union. This includes 16 
submarines and missile boats each, and four destroyers and 
corvettes each.

  [Text] Bangalore--The Rs 500-crore [rupees] Indo-Singapore 
Information Technology Park was inaugurated here on Friday by 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. 
  An agreement was signed on the occasion between the three 
joint venture partners promoting the park: Ratan N. Tata, 
chairman, Tata Industries Ltd; Albert Hong, chairman, 
Information Technology Park Investment Pvt Ltd (ITPI), 
Singapore; and M.C. Satyawadi, chairman, Karnataka Industrial 
Areas Development Board (KIADB). The investment of the three 
partners will be in the ratio of 40, 40 and 20 per cent 
respectively. 
  Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Goh felt Bangalore 
would soon attract a large number of persons from the region, 
with an increasing number coming from Singapore itself. 
  However, the resulting boom would cause congestion and 
Bangalore would soon find itself tackling a problem similar to 
the one Singapore has been grappling with for a long time--that 
of balancing growth in a limited area with environmental 
protection. Though Bangalore's leaders had shown vision in 
demarcating a green belt, the problem of restructuring to meet 
the influx could be tackled with expertise from Singapore, Goh 
said. 
  Karnataka Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily noted that the 
park will represent Singapore's single largest investment in 
India to date. 
  He said the park had been conceived and set in motion in the 
quickest possible time, and this will be the state government's 
attitude to future projects proposed by industrialists. 
  Singapore's Economic Development Board Chairman Philip Yeo 
agreed. "The launch is testimony to the initiative taken by the 
Government of Karnataka," he said. 
  Ratan Tata said the park would hopefully attract companies 
to 
India for high-tech activities by providing an environment equal 
to or better than the best abroad. Others who spoke on the 
occasion included Karnataka Governor Khurshed Alam Khan and 
Union Railway Minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief.

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 30--The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today warned that the balance between religion 
and politics, which are distinct and separate spheres, is under 
challenge as never before. "Freedom of religion does not imply 
freedom to misuse religion for political ends," he said while 
opening an international conference on `religion and politics' 
here. 
  Cautioning the people against divisions of majority and 
minority on the basis of religion, he said the polarisation with 
a religious focus was sought to be turned into "political 
polarisation for party advantage." 
  "This obviously violates the basic secular structure of the 
Constitution under which democracy operates. The line between 
the two is thus abundantly clear and needs to be enforced in 
whatever manner necessary," he stressed. 
  Organised by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary 
Studies, 
under the aegis of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the conference has 
drawn distinquished scholars from India and abroad. The Human 
Resource Development Minister, Mr. Arjun Singh and Ms. Sonia 
Gandhi, chairperson of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, attended the 
conference. 
  Mr. Rao said religion has and will continue to have a 
profound influence on the way people think, feel, act and react. 
This influence could not be wished away but the issue had to be 
examined with an empathetic understanding of human nature and 
evolve solutions in consonance with it. 
  Three key points: Highlighting three important 
aspects, Mr. Rao said that first the Constitution had the 
necessary clarity to specify the domain of religion in respect 
of politics and to take care of any transgressions. Second, 
freedom of religion does not imply freedom to misuse religion 
for political ends and this needs to be specifically spelt out. 
Third, our ancient civilisation provides a sound base on which 
to build a model for regulating the interaction of religion and 
politics. 
  Dwelling upon religious tolerance in Indian society, Mr. Rao 
said a liberal outlook was the distinctive feature of our 
civilisation. "This is a remarkable example of a society, and a 
polity, in which there is a wide range of religious communities 
that co-existed over long centuries," he said. 
  Brushing aside as "romantic" suggestions that the 
co-existence between diverse religious communities had been 
entirely free of social violence and communal strife, Mr. Rao 
said the dominant characteristic of religious interaction within 
Indian society is that of tolerance and harmony. 
  It would be appropriate for scholars to explore how our 
religious and political leaders were able to create in the past 
a durable, liberal society within a multi-religious polity. 
Pausing upon his reflections, the Prime Minister added that 
while life is taken as comprehensive, its various aspects have 
also been developed separately, each with an autonomy which 
makes it free and unaffected by the other to a great extent. 
"This could be a form of the separation of religion from 
politics, which has been achieved quite naturally and 
spontaneously. Neither has questioned the other, nor interfered 
with the other. There appears to be no time when an adversarial 
relationship developed between religion and the political 
process." 
  Paying rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi whose 46th death 
anniversary was observed today, the Prime Minister said it was 
tragic that this apostle of non-violence met his end at the 
hands of a religious fanatic. "In the manner of his death we 
have a demonstration of the difference between faith and 
fanaticism and of the damage that religious fanaticism can 
inflict." 
  `Disturbing develoments': Stressing the need to 
examine the relation between religion and politics urgently 
because of certain disturbing developments in recent years, Mr. 
Rao expressed disdain over the divisive influence of religious 
fanaticism on the international scene. "Today, when a scholar 
proposes that the next major conflict in the world will be on 
religious lines, people listen with attention. Forty years back 
such a thesis would have been dismissed out of hand," he said. 
  In his keynote address, Mr. Arjun Singh said the foundations 
of the Constitution rest upon the sanctity of liberal 
institutions and also upon the freedom of religious worship. The 
imperative to strike a meaningful balance between religion and 
politics to avoid disruption of social order and human progress 
is universally recognised, he said. 
  In her brief opening remarks, Ms. Sonia Gandhi, touched upon 
the universality of Indian culture. She said the beauty and 
profundity of Indian culture was that it had received and 
welcomed several faiths and was home to several major religions.

  [Text] Guwahati, Feb. 1--In a follow-up to its ruling on 
Friday, the Cauhati High Court today directed the Election 
Commission to include in the draft electoral rolls, the names of 
encroachers on government land who are otherwise eligible to 
exercise their franchise. 
  The draft rolls with respect to these people are to be 
published and their names included in the final voters list 
after claims and objections, if any, are disposed of in 
accordance with law. 
  Legal experts said today's suo moto order by a division 
bench 
comprising Chief Justice R.K. Manisena Singh and Justice Neera 
Sharma clarifies the operative portions of the court's earlier 
ruling. On Friday, the court held Clause 7.4 of the Election 
Commission's special revised instructions issued on May last 
year, unconstitutional and violative of the Representation of 
People Act (1950). 
  The controversial commission clause prohibited the inclusion 
of names of all encroachers on village grazing reserves (VGR), 
professional grazing reserves (PGR), forest land, 
khas land or any other government land, in the 
electoral rolls. 
  Later the commission modified the directive under pressure 
from various quarters, including the state government. It said 
the instructions would not apply to those Indian citizens whom 
the Assam government does not intend to evict from the lands 
under their encroachment until the end of 1993. 
  Today's court directive has given a new turn to the rolls 
revision process in Assam. The final voters list in 86 of the 
state's 126 Assembly constituencies have already been published 
last month. A special revision of rolls was ordered in the 40 
remaining constituencies, perhaps due to a suspicion that they 
still contained names of illegal aliens. 
  Subsequently, the election commission ordered an up-date on 
the rolls in all the 126 constituencies in the state, with 
January 1, 1994, as the qualifying date. The commission has 
finally set May 17, 1994, as the deadline for completing the 
entire rolls revision process in Assam that began with its 
directive for a special intensive revision on August 21, 1992. 
  However, the task is far from over. The commission will now 
have to prepare draft rolls for the encroachers on government 
land who are otherwise eligible to vote. This process has to be 
carried out in each of the 126 constituencies, including the 86 
where the final voters list have already been published. The 
names of such persons in the draft roll can be included in the 
final loss only after claims and objections are disposed of. 
  Minority leaders have welcomed the court order to include 
names of encroachers in the draft rolls and their subsequent 
publication. They feel this will help those 1000s of other 
people whose names are in List II of the draft rolls and whose 
citizenship, they claim, is unnecessarily doubted. Many of them 
could not put up claims for including their names in the voters 
list since they lack the documents stipulated by the election 
commission. Many of the encroachers also do not possess proper 
documents to prove their relationship.

  [Text] Guwahati, Jan. 30--The controversy over the 
electoral rolls in Assam has taken a new turn with the Guwahati 
High Court holding that Clause 7.4 of the "Special Revised 
Instructions" of the Election Commission, issued on May 18 last, 
"unconstitutional, arbitrary and violative of the Representation 
of the People Act, 1950, and rules framed thereunder." 
  Specifically, the Court has held that this Clause violated 
Article 14 of the Constitution. 
  A Division Bench of the Court, comprising the Chief Justice, 
Mr. R.K. Manisena Singh and Justice Ms. Meera Sarma, passed the 
order on Friday while disposing of writ petitions challenging 
some of these guidelines filed by some leading members of the 
United Minorities Front (UMF). 
  The controversial clause read: "7.3. The Electoral 
Registration Officer shall also take every possible care to 
ensure that names of persons in whose cases objections were 
filed and upheld, as well as names of persons whose claims were 
rejected during any earlier revisions of 1990, 1985, etc., on 
the ground that they were not citizens of India are not to be 
included in the draft roll. He should also ensure that cases 
where enquiries have been initiated by the police with a view to 
filing cases under the Foreigners Act, 1946 or IM(DT) [expansion 
not given] Act, 1983, are also excluded. 
  Similarly under Clause 7.4, the Electoral Registration 
Officer should ensure that the names of encroachers on 
VGR/PGR/forest lands/khas lands or any other Government lands 
are not included in the draft rolls. 
  These guidelines provoked Opposition from virtually the 
whole 
spectrum of political opinion in the State, though the grounds 
for such opposition were different. The fact is that 
encroachments on Village Grazing Reserves (VGR), Professional 
Grazing reserves (PGR), and forest and Khas lands are a 
generalised phenomenon with every section of the population 
encroaching upon them, though the perception about the nature of 
such encroachment, or about the identity of such encroachers, 
has always been selective, with "popular" opinion holding that 
it is only the descendents of erstwhile migrants from former 
East Bengal who are predominantly such encroachers. 
  Modified guidelines: Faced with such opposition, 
to which the State Government too was a party, the Election 
Commission modified those guidelines with the following proviso 
added to Clause 7.4: "Provided that the above instruction shall 
not apply in relation to such eligible Indian citizens whom the 
State Government of Assam does not propose or plan to remove 
from the lands under their encroachment immediately and at least 
up to the end of the year 1993. "In other words, the 
modification of the original guideline not merely acknowledged 
that they were difficult (if not impossible) to implement, but 
also constituted an escape clause, as it were, enabling the 
Election Commission to make a retreat from an untenable position. 
  The petitions filed in the Court had also challenged Clauses 
6.7, 6.9 and 6.10 of the Special Revised Instructions which had 
provided for the publication of two "Lists" of enumerated 
voters: a List I, "containing the names of persons who are 
verified by the District Magistrate to be Indian citizens": and 
a List II, "containing those names which are not considered 
Indian citizens by the District Magistrate," (6.7). Further, 
Clause 6.10 said that "Where the police have initiated inquiries 
in respect of any person with a view to filing cases under 
Foreigners' Act, 1946 or Illegal Migrants (determination by 
tribunals) Act, 1983, the names of every such person shall be 
included in List II and not in List I." The result of following 
that directive was that List II had about 15,76,000 [as printed] 
names which included the names of 13,73,000 who had filed 
claims, and in respect of about nine lakhs of whom such claims 
had been accepted. 
  According to a document prepared by the United Minorities 
Front (UMF), whose intervention on the issue in the court has 
led to the order, the Election Commissioner's directives 
envisaged treating all persons included in List II, including 
about eight lakhs whose cases had been referred to inquiries 
under the Foreigners' Act and the IM(DT) Act, were treated as 
"non-citizens." 
  According to the UMF, of these only about 58,000 cases had 
been referred to the tribunals formed under the provision of the 
two Acts, and according to sources in the State Government, only 
20,000 of these had been finally and indubitably found to be 
illegal aliens. 
  The Court which had in an earlier order directed that the 
names in List II should be published has now questioned the very 
classification of people into groups of "citizens" and citizens 
whose status is "suspect." It has held that the classification 
should be reasonable and not based merely on "suspicion."

<F P=106> [Article by Deepak K. Upreti: "Khurana Government Has Many </F>
Handicaps"] 
  [Text] After over 100 years since Mughal rule ended, the 
Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP] first empire in Delhi shows an 
ironic resemblance to the reign of the last Mughal King who had 
the high-sounding title of Badshah without any effective power. 
  BJP chieftain Madan Lal Khurana is finding it hard to have 
his say in the affairs of the capital city under the dominant 
presence of the Congress under Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. With a 
truncated statehood under his arm, the Chief Minister's 
announcements are evoking amusing responses from his Congress 
rivals. 
  His recent threat to cut off water to VIPs [very important 
persons], including Union ministers, in the wake of a water 
crisis in Delhi, illustrates the queer status of Delhi's Chief 
Minister. The dispute on the sharing of Yamuna waters between 
Haryana and Delhi has been used by the Haryana Chief Minister to 
bully the newly-stalled BJP Government in Delhi. 
  The decision of Mr. Bhajan Lal to stop water supply to the 
Haiderpur water treatment plant in Delhi despite last month's 
agreement had placed Mr. Khurana at the mercy of Prime Minister 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, who in all such cases happens to be the 
final arbitrator. The Haryana Government's action had reduced 
the daily supply of water to the capital by 25 mgd [million 
gallons per day], severely affecting parts of the city. 
Notwithstanding Central assurance, the Haryana Chief Minister 
has kept cocking a snook at his counterpart in Delhi. 
  Well aware of the Delhi Government's status vis-a-vis other 
State Governments, the Congress leaders were only too amused 
with Mr. Khurana's threat to cut off water supply to VIP areas, 
prompting Delhi Congress Pradesh Committee chief H.K.L. Bhagat 
to describe the threat as "childish." 
  The toothless Khurana Government, which was elected by an 
overwhelming mandate last year, finds itself caught in a cleft. 
The limited powers of the 70-member Delhi State Assembly would 
not permit the BJP to implement the promises it had made to its 
supporters in the capital and yet it remains vulnerable to their 
criticism for its apparent non-performance. 
  The constitution of the Assembly excludes it from having any 
jursidiction over land and land use, law and order and allows 
full Central control over financial matters. Subjects related to 
the land are of vital importance in relation to the planned 
development of the metropolis but the powers of making any 
change in the status quo in land relations are 
largely vested in the Union Urban Housing and Development 
Ministry. 
  Similarly, in the case of surface transport, law and order 
and other major subjects, the Central Government still occupies 
the driver's seat and retains the relevant powers which would be 
required by the BJP Government to bring about any meaningful 
improvement in the lot of about 93 lakh inhabitants of Delhi. 
  The megacity, which has the highest suspended pollution in 
the world and is virtually crammed with over 30 lakhs vehicles, 
requires major legislative changes to streamline the vehicular 
traffic and restrict the rising rate of pollution. The 
short-lived populist moves in the past, including that of Ms. 
Maneka Gandhi, former Union Environment Minister, to check 
vehicular pollution had evoked more ire than applause from 
Delhites. 
  The political power attained by the BJP has, so far, allowed 
it to implement only those key promises which were also bandied 
about by its rival political parties, including the Congress. 
The regularisation of 600 jhuggi-jhopri clusters 
which existed before March 1993, has, thus, come on the top of 
BJP's agenda and is likely to find a smooth passage in the 
Assembly. 
  Apart from taking small steps towards the development of 
Delhi which includes making roads better by removing 
encroachments, improving streetlights and cleaning right the 
abysmally bad lavatories, the Khurana Government has made its 
first major political move to book the culprits of the November 
1984, Sikh riots in Delhi. The nine-member panel constituted by 
the BJP Government has recently indicted over 70 persons, 
including Congress leaders like Sajjan Kumar and Mr. Bhagat. 
  The panel with Mr. Justice (Retd) R.S. Narula at its head 
has 
accused the Home Ministry of not responding to the CBI's 
[Central Bureau of Investigation] application to file a 
charge-sheet against Mr. Sajjan Kumar since 1992. However, the 
recommendations of the panel, which had Lt-Gen. (Retd) Jasgit 
Singh Aurura and academician, Dr. Mahip Singh, as its members, 
are unlikely to carry much weight with the Central Government. 
It may be noted that even the recommendations of the 
Jain-Aggarwal Committee, which was appointed by the Union 
Government itself, have not been implemented. 
  The twin status of Delhi has all the elements which could 
create more complications than resolve them. The partial status 
of statehood and overlapping jurisdiction of Centre and State is 
sure to stoke the fires of political controversy in the coming 
months. 
  The Delhi State BJP currently busy in the selection of the 
candidates for the municipal elections will, however, have 
relatively more freedom to function in the local body if it 
manages to get as big a majority as it did in the Assembly 
elections. 
  A pitched battle is on the cards for the municipal elections 
as Mr. Bhagat, the Congress supremo in Delhi, is making a last 
ditch effort to re-establish himself and gain the political 
ground which he had lost in the Assembly elections.

  [Text] The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] on Saturday alleged 
VABAL scam (Value Based Advanced Licensing scheme) worth 
thousands of crores, may turn out to be much bigger than the 
stock scam, urging the government to inquire into it and punish 
the guilty. 
  Talking to newsmen BJP economic exports Jai Dubashi who is a 
member of the national executive alleged that in this scam that 
concerns commerce ministry, the customs revenue had been hit by 
Rs 3,000 [rupees] crore and that excuse revenue by another Rs 
2,000 crore. He said the exports figures being quoted by the 
government are highly inflated and need be inquired and checked. 
  He said people involved in this VABAL scam are owners of 
firms close to the ruling Congress party. At least one firm had 
figures previously in a similar case of dubious import-export 
business. 
  In a joint statement Mr Jay Dubashi and BJP spokesman 
Krishan 
Lal Sharma, MP [member of Parliament] said there was no end to 
scams under the Narasimha Rao Government. Two years ago it was 
the stock and banking scam in which over Rs 5,000 crore were 
spirited away under the nose of a slumbering Finance Minister by 
a gaggle of Congress politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen 
close to the ruling party. 
  And now there was another scam this time in the Commerce 
Ministry from whom exporters and businessmen claiming to be 
exporters secured licences for exports and robbed the government 
of over Rs 1,800 crore by manipulating an export incentive 
scheme called VABAL. 
  The joint statement of the BJP leaders termed the above 
figure as only the tip of the iceberg as the actual loss must be 
much more--so large that it was unlikely to have taken place 
without the collusion of insiders in the ministry, just as the 
stock and banking scandal was the handiwork of people who had an 
access to the highest levels in the Finance Ministry and the 
Reserve Bank of India. The modus operandi of the exports "under 
the VABAL scheme is that an exporter files a declaration for 
exports or fictitious exports, obviously in collusion with 
authorities which can be as much as 20 to 30 times his actual 
exports. The foreign exchange he "earns" was nothing but his own 
money sent out of India through "Hawala" transactions. These 
bogus "exports" promptly go into the books of the Commerce 
Ministry as legitimate exports, though they are nothing of the 
kind." 
  "In addition, the exporter gets import licences for raw 
materials on the basis of his bogus declaration, which can be as 
large as two-thirds of "exporters." He does not pay customs and 
other duties on them. Thus he launders black money into white, 
cheats on taxes and helps the Commerce Ministry to cook up its 
books and claim that exports are booming said the joint 
statement. 
  They said some of the first which have received such 
licences are close to the ruling party. At least one firm has 
figured previously in a similar case of dubious import-export 
business, the BJP leaders alleged in their statement maintaining 
that if exporters can claim bogus exports under VABAL scheme 
they can also do so outside VABAL, which meant that a large 
proportion of the so-called exports must be fictitious. 
  The joint statement wanted the Commerce and the Finance 
Ministries to come clean on the VABAL scam and tell the BJP what 
steps if any they have taken so far to plug the loopholes and to 
book the culprits.

  [Text] New Delhi--Efforts towards Communist unity have 
begun again after three decades of separation between CPI 
[Communist Party of India] and CPI(M) [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist]. Both parties have set up co-ordination 
committees in most states as a first step to their merger. 
Merger as such is still not mentioned in so many words but that 
is what leaders of both parties have in mind as their ultimate 
aim. 
  The call for unity has been given this time round in an 
unusual way. So far unity calls were erratic and disjointed. 
Polemics now and then punctuated them and unity moves went two 
steps backward soon after going one step forward. In a 
significant departure from old grooves of hostility, general 
secretaries of both parties, Harkishan Singh Surjeet CPI(M) and 
Indrajit Gupta (CPI) have now shared one letter pad to send out 
a circular on unity. This is intended to inspire a sense of 
urgency among their comrades. 
  Their circular of December 11 asks party leaders in all 
states to form co-ordination committees to discuss "various 
issues confronting the body politic" and for "strengthening the 
left." West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura have been left out on the 
ground that "left democratic consolidation has come into 
existence and is working alright." The circular points out 
central level co-ordination has been taking place for many 
years. States which have "difficulties" have been asked to seek 
central parties' help. 
  West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura are states where communist 
parties are strong. The process of merger can instantly throw up 
questions of share in leadership. Party sources admit that 
several people who hold big or small positions in their 
respective parties will have to be ready for sacrifice when 
merger takes place. That can at once unsettle matters rather 
than solve them. 
  Other minuscule left parties, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist 
Party] and Forward Bloc, also may be affected. Communist leaders 
feel that those partners of the left democratic front can be 
irked if a CPI-CPI(M) club is constituted within that front. If 
bilateral relations between the two communist parties are 
emphasised even while harping on the left democratic theme, left 
unity may suffer, communist leaders say. Which is why they have 
decided to make haste slowly in those states. 
  Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra set up co-ordination committees 
soon after the decision on unity taken at the last three-yearly 
conclaves of both parties was communicated to state units there. 
But that is not where unity has to be forged. CPI leader A.B. 
Bardhan says that unity as a prelude to merger can be possible 
and meaningful only when it is achieved in areas where either 
party has a significant base. But his own partymen are dragging 
their feet in Bihar, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh where they are a 
shade stronger than their "big brother." If CPI is not keen to 
have unity where it feels it is better off, why should CPI(M) be 
magnanimous in its strongholds? 
  The present unity move has come soon after the assembly 
elections in December. The poll outcome was not exactly pleasant 
to communist leaders, notwithstanding the debacle of their bete 
noire, BJP. Their ally, National Front, had come a cropper. Not 
only have they to find a new, viable ally but reunite themselves 
in a stroke of left consolidation. 
  The old hostilities and imagined ideological differences, 
they feel, can be left happily behind. The irony is that the 
unity move has come when dissensions are rife, particularly in 
CPI(M) in areas where it is strong. And, leaders of both parties 
have found a new cause for quarrel. CPI(M) has not a whit liked 
CPI's soft corner for expelled K.R. Gowri. Its anger is all over 
a single CPI remark: "Gowri's expulsion was unfortunate."

<F P=106> [Article by Mihir Mukherjee: "CPI(M) (Communist Party of </F>
India-Marxist) in Troubled Waters Over Corruption, Ideology"] 
  [Text] More than two years after the CPI(M)'s [Communist 
Party of India-Marxist] Party Congress decided in Madras to 
redraft the party programme--and set up a committee for this 
purpose--no progress has been made in this regard. 
  There has been no amendment to the party progamme, despite 
significant changes in the political situation both within the 
country and abroad. The redrafting committee, which includes Mr 
Jyoti Basu and Mr Anil Biswas, editor of GANASAKTI, as 
representatives from West Bengal, met last month in New Delhi 
but is reportedly yet to come out with any concrete proposals. 
  In fact, senior leaders say that the CPI(M) finds itself in 
a 
dilemma over the policy that it should follow. Sources say that 
the 1964 party programme, which borrowed heavily from the 
Chinese line of the Progressive Democratic Front, now seems 
anachronistic considering the momentous changes in Beijing 
which, of late, has been cosying up to the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  This ideological crisis has been deepened by the break-up of 
the Soviet Union and the current political instability in Russia. 
  However, the State CPI(M) has apparently little time to 
deliberate on these theoretical issues as its leaders are 
reportedly busy suppressing internecine conflicts and charges of 
corruption against party leaders. 
  Veteran leaders say that the conflicts within the party can 
be gauged by the demand for State plenums. Such demands have 
been raised in Kerala and Tripura, two strongholds of the party. 
Some time ago, such a demand was raised in West Bengal by the 
former State Education Minister, Mr Partha Dey. 
  Dissident leaders in the State CPI(M) say that corruption 
has 
been pushed to the top of the party's agenda in the State. They 
allege that it has become so rampant and widespread that even 
the Chief Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu, who earlier preferred to 
gloss over the complaints has reportedly expressed serious 
concern. 
  Sources said that Mr Basu was informed by the Centre of the 
involvement of local CPI(M) leaders in the alleged pilferage of 
Metro Railway property from Noapara stockyard and Railway 
property from Kancharapara. Responding to this, Mr Basu 
reportedly asked his party secretary, Mr Sailen Dasgupta, to 
probe the matter. 
  However, sources say that the party hiearchy now finds the 
situation beyond its control. Mr Dasgupta reportedly called a 
meeting of the local committee of the party at Baranagor to look 
into the complaints of Metro Railway contractors. However, 
sources said that he could not attend the meeting owing to stiff 
resistance from a section of the party. 
  Dissidents allege that in North and South 24-Parganas, the 
party is virtually split between haves and have nots--"those who 
can make money and those who cannot." 
  The CPI(M) leadership is allegedly unable to take drastic 
action as corruption has reportedly spread its network far and 
wide. Disgruntled CPI(M) leaders allege that in South 
24-Parganas a bitter confrontation is being witnessed over 
several bheris where a strong lobby--headed by a 
State Minister and close associates of the party 
leadership--calls the shots. 
  Many in the rank and file of the party complain that the 
party leadership does not take action against the people at the 
top but take disciplinary measures against those at the bottom 
of the hiearchy. This has been indicated, they allege, by the 
relatively light punishment meted out to the Calcutta district 
committee members, who were allegedly close to the satta don, 
Rashid Khan. 
  Members of the inner circle of the party say that in the 
context of the crisis looming over the party, Mr Basu is now 
looking for a relatively easy way out. Sources say that, 
therefore, an early election cannot be ruled out.

  [Text] Madras--The Centre's tactics in announcing a 
pre-budget increase in the price of levy sugar distributed 
through the Public Distribution System (PDS), from Rs. 
8.30[rupees] to Rs. 9.05 per kg, have been condemned by the 
political parties in Tamil Nadu. 
  Describing the hike as "anti-people and anti-democratic," 
CPM 
[Communist Party of India-Marxist] state secretary A. 
Nallasivan, MP, said on Friday that by increasing the prices of 
essential commodities before the budget presentation, the Centre 
was trying to create the illusion that there were no new taxes 
in the budget. At the same time, the hike in the average 
ex-factory levy sugar price from Rs. 670.99 to Rs. 734.08 a 
quintal, had helped the sugar mill owners to attain huge profits. 
  The proposed price hike would severely affect the people, he 
said, and asked the Centre to drop the move. 
  CPI [Communist Party of India] state secretary R. Nallakannu 
said the price increase was "unnecessary and not proper." 
  State Janata Dal general secretary K. Jagaveerapandian said 
the government had once again adopted the strategy of hiking the 
prices of essential commodities before the budget. Moreover, in 
the last one year, the Centre had thrice decreased the quantity 
of sugar allocated for distribution through the PDS and thereby 
caused an artificial demand for sugar in the open market. 
Besides this, the Centre's decision had helped businessmen to 
sell sugar at exorbitant prices. "This is a cheap way of duping 
the public," he added. 
  UCPI [United Communist Party of India] state president N. 
Nanjappan and secretary K. Manickkam, in a joint statement, said 
the decision to increase the sugar price from Feb. 1 would 
greatly affect the common man. Moreover, it would pave the way 
for increase of sugar prices in the open market. "There is a 
wide gap between the Centre's assurances and the reality." 
  Referring to the increase in the prices of domestic LPG 
[liquidied petroleum gas] cylinders and rice, the leaders urged 
the Centre to take immediate steps to reduce the prices of 
essential commodities. 
  T. Kumaresan, president, All India Farmers Democratic Party, 
said the hike was "unjustified," and would hit the weaker 
sections hard.

<F P=106> [Article by Gaganendranath Baral: "World Wary About </F>
Salesman's Wares"] 
  [Text] The prime minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, is in 
Davos, Switzerland, to find takers for his economic reforms 
package. In an increasingly competitive market for international 
capital, restructuring an economy by itself is not enough. It 
has to be marketed and sold. Davos' World Economic Reform 
provides an excellent advertising platform to draw the West's 
attention to the changed Indian economy. 
  India being a latecomer to the restructuring game, Mr Rao 
faces an uphill task in selling his government's reforms. 
Countries which started reforming earlier or have taken their 
restructuring further are already capturing significant chunks 
of global capital. Mr Rao will need to make a pretty strong 
sales pitch to convince international investors India also 
offers high and safe returns on their investments. But no amount 
of hard sell can push an inferior product. 
  So what is Mr Rao pushing? The government has been 
highlighting its success on three fronts--reducing the fiscal 
and current account deficits and containing inflation. The 
fiscal deficit has been brought down from 8.4 per cent of the 
gross domestic product [GDP] in 1990-91 to 5.7 per cent in 
1992-93. The current account deficit is currently $2.6 billion, 
down from $7.7 billion in 1990-91. Inflation has been brought 
down from 12 per cent in 1990 to around 8 per cent now. 
  Yet government profligacy, despite claims to the contrary, 
has not been reined in. The 1993-94 fiscal deficit displays all 
indications of settling at around 6.5 per cent of the projected 
GDP. With industrial output stagnating in the first half of the 
year, GDP growth projections of 5 per cent now seem optimistic. 
The deficit ratio could be considerably higher. 
  This year's fiscal mismanagement has been touted as a 
politically induced aberration. There are some aspects of 
India's fiscal correction for which official explanations are 
not so readily forthcoming. The revenue deficit is now about 
half the fiscal deficit and growing. Fiscal correction has 
largely been at the cost of capital formation. Capital 
expenditure has declined from 6 per cent of the GDP in 1990-91 
to 4.3 per cent in 1992-93. The government is now offering only 
17 cent [as printed] budgetary support for infrastructure 
projects. 
  The trade deficit contraction has come out of a reduction in 
imports rather than significant export growth. Imports have been 
controlled more by domestic demand recession than by any policy 
change. Since 1991 import tariffs have been reduced. But the 
average tariff cut has been less than the devaluation of the 
rupee, thus giving imports an advantage. The government is 
usurping credit for the largely exogenous growth of exports in 
the latter part of 1993-94 although it has not achieved much by 
the way of controlling inflation. 
  The spectacular decline in the current account deficit this 
year is largely due to an exogenous jump in foreign portfolio 
funds flowing into India. This inflow has more to do with the 
state of recently opened Indian stock markets than with 
macro-economic indices. 
  Inflation in India is driven mainly by agricultural 
production, the fiscal deficit and monetary expension. Net bank 
credit to the government is growing around 12 per cent over the 
past couple of years. Money supply growth is averaging over 15 
per cent, way above target. Fortunately for the government, the 
monsoons have been generous for five years in a row. 
Inflationery pressures have been dampened largely by good 
harvests. Monetary and fiscal correction cannot claim credit for 
this. 
  But the major weakness in the government's reforms programme 
remains in the government's attitude towards the exercise. The 
emphasis has been on making them look good on paper. 
  There is no economic logic in the government's including 
divestment receipts in its revenue account. There are of course 
International Monetary Fund loans whose dibursements depend on 
the size of the deficit. What is surprising is the IMF has 
accepted the government's accounting procedure which 
incorporated divestment receipts to compress the fiscal deficit 
by 0.5 per cent of the GDP over the past two years. 
  Similarly, the government's definition of the primary 
deficit 
subtracts gross rather than net interest payments from the 
fiscal deficit. This does not make sense either but helps 
present a better picture. The Reserve Bank of India, too, has 
not sterilised burgeoning foreign exchange reserves, 
disregarding its effect on the price line. Here again the 
emphasis has been on advertising short term achievement at the 
cost of future export efficiency. 
  In fact most of the restructuring so far has been done with 
an eye on revenue generation. The government is yet to address 
the really important issues, the high capital-output ratio and 
labour market reforms. 
  That India remains a high cost economy is not seriously 
debated. And the government roll back in capital expenditure is 
not helping matters. Liberalisation is not laissez 
faire. If the idea is for India to evolve into market 
socialism, the government cannot overlook its role in 
infrastructural development. 
  As long as infrastructure remains the bottleneck, hopes of 
reducing the capital-output ratio could remain just hopes. More 
alarmingly, there is a complementary nature between private 
investment and infrastructure that the government can afford to 
ignore at its own risk. Mr Rao would benefit from a closer 
scrutiny of the Chinese experience where a minimum social 
overhead capital was generated before foreign capital was 
invited in. 
  Apart from infrastructure, the other major area where the 
government has a major role to play in market socialism is in 
social spending. But expenditure on health and education have 
been declining in real terms since reforms began. The government 
has not been able to resist cutting expenditure on these 
accounts to keep its books in better shape. 
  Labour market reform has been on the cards since 1991. It is 
still on the cards. The government has been on the verge of 
taking tough decisions for the past one year. But somehow they 
never seem to materialise. The attitude most discernable here 
has been wait long enough and the problems will go away. The 
idea is not replace retiring employees. Then by 2000, there will 
be no overstaffing. The question is whether India can wait so 
long. 
  Mr Rao has hidden behind politics to explain its lack of 
enthusiasm on reforming the labour market. The government's lack 
of majority, we have been told, has held it back. 
  Mr Rao has managed to cobble an absolute majority in 
Parliament in his three years in power. Yet an exit policy is as 
distant as it was when he assumed office. The present government 
has a year and a half to go. Two Southern states go to the polls 
later this year. With them, the runup to next year's general 
elections begins. It is difficult to envisage the government 
taking on the unions at this juncture. 
  Unless the government begins to take stock of the runaway 
revenue deficit and monetary expansion, infrastructural and 
human resource constraints and labour market reforms, the actual 
investment climate will continue to remain inclement. 
  Taking hard decision is sadly not Mr Rao's forte. But if he 
is to raise international confidence in the Indian economy, hard 
decisions are what he will have to take. Posturing at 
international fora is one thing, backing up claims is another.

<F P=106> [Article by Arun K. Varma] </F>
  [Text] The second coming of boomlike conditions on major 
bourses is structurally different from the heady pre-securities 
scandal days. 
  One significant difference is the low level of participation 
by the common investor in the ongoing bull phase. Unlike during 
the Harshad Mehta heydays, the common investor stands dazed by 
the upswing in stockmarket indices while he finds himself cash 
strapped. 
  During the pre-scandal period when the stockmarket was 
reaching dizzy heights, the favourite topic among office 
employees and even among housewives at kitty parties was how to 
reap the highest returns in the shortest timespan. This time, 
though the upward trend in markets and the scope for making fast 
bucks is being spoken about, a certain weariness and confusion 
can be detected. 
  Justifiably so. Because when the bull operators led by Mr 
Mehta raided the stockmarkets, they were also pulling a 
substantial section of the middle class into the whirlpool of 
stockmarket operations. After the bust, thousands lost their 
money saved for their children's marriages or careers and 
post-retirement benefits. 
  Mr T.J. Jacob, a deputy commandant with the Special 
Protection Group, says, "I preferred buying shares to building a 
house. And I lost heavily." This is just one example. 
  After 18 months of lull, mainly because of the uncertainty 
that loomed over stockmarket operations, the market began to 
show signs of recovery in late October last year. It is 
interesting that even though foreign institutional investors 
were allowed entry into the stockmarket as early as in the first 
half of 1992, all of them preferred to watch the developments. 
  A group manager in the merchant banking division of ANZ 
Grindlays Bank said that the ongoing boom has its roots 
elsewhere. "A reason for the non-involvement of the common 
investor is Securities and Exchange Board of India attempts to 
institutionalise the stockmarket investment, as practised in the 
developed countries," he said. 
  Prescribing the minimum limits for investors--Rs 5,000 
[rupees] for equity and Rs 1,000 for mutual funds and other 
fixed deposits--is proof of this. It insulates small and medium 
investors against the volatility of stockmarket behaviour. 
  It would also lead to a more realistic individual income. As 
per the new rules, a person applying for allotment of equities 
is required to furnish his permanent bank account number which 
can be traced by the income tax department if necessary. More 
transparency would be brought into financial transactions. 
  This however would bar very small investors from entering 
the 
market. The only players in the stockmarket would be individuals 
with high liquidity or financial institutions. 
  This situation brings the focus on financial institutions, 
both Indian and foreign, as potential stockmarket players. 
Considering the excess liquidity with banks, poor industrial 
performance and not so encouraging credit offtake, domestic 
financial institutions are unlikely to lead the bull rampage. 
  Consider this case. Industrial performance in 1991-92 
registered a negative growth of 0.1 per cent. In the following 
year though positive it was only 1.8 per cent. During the half 
year period of this fiscal year, the growth was only 1.5 per 
cent as against the projected 4 per cent. Mining and 
manufacturing sectors are performing poorly this year. 
  Inflation, another vital parameter during this period, rose 
to disheartening figures. From an alarming 13 per cent in 
1991-92, it slid to 11 per cent in 1992-93 and is hovering 
around 8.4 per cent. Capital intensive and infrastructural 
industries have not yet picked up. 
  On the other hand, FIIs [foreing institutional investors] 
which do not have to consider any obligations have the entire 
stockmarket for a free run. That is what is happening. FIIs 
waited a full year though they were registered in 1992. This 
delay was necessitated by the need to gauge the prospects and 
profitability of the Indian stocks. Moreover, by this time, 
Indian corporates themselves had established their creditibility 
overseas. The oversubscription of global depository receipts and 
Euro bonds by a host of Indian companies is proof. 
  At a time the authenticity of the commitment to economic 
liberalisation has been proved and Indian stocks are lying low, 
the FIIs decide to enter the market. This then is boom time. For 
foreign fund managers who operate on global dimensions, Indian 
stocks seem the cheapest and the best. 
  It is also remarkable the recovery of Indian stocks began 
when other Asian markets were down. Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, 
Bangkok and Seoul are at present undergoing a lull. In this 
situation it is only logical for foreign funds to find their way 
to Indian stockmarkets. 
  The gain of the national stock index shows that FIIs are 
more 
into cash scrips than forward trading. NSE [?National Stock 
Exchange] gains have outstripped the rise in the Sensex, the 
index for the Bombay Stock Index. Sensex has a narrower base 
than the NSE, and forward deals influence its movements more 
than they do in the case of the NSE. 
  These factors indicate the involvement of the common 
investor 
in the present boom is likely to be minimal. There is danger in 
the FII funds generated boom. When the FIIs decide to book 
profits, stock markets may be forced to make a crash landing. 
Then, the fact the boom is not backed up by strong economic 
fundamentals will become clear, and alarmingly so.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 1--Significant changes have been 
made in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, to pave the way for 
banking sector reforms and establishment of private sector 
banks. The amendments to the Act were made through an ordinance 
promulgated on Monday. 
  The ceiling on voting rights of a shareholder in a banking 
company has been raised from the present 1 per cent to 10 per 
cent. This will allow promoters of private sector banks to 
exercise voting rights up to 10 per cent. 
  The Act has been amended to allow splitting of the post of 
chairman and managing director. The ordinance provides for a 
part-time non-executive chairman. The existing provisions 
stipulate that a bank is to be headed by a chairman-cum-managing 
director. 
  Section 16 of the Act has been amended to stipulate that no 
banking company incorporated in India shall have as a director 
on its board any person who is a director of any other banking 
company. The amended section also provides that no banking 
company shall have on its board more than three directors who 
are directors of companies which among themselves are entitled 
to exercise voting rights in excess of 20 per cent of the total 
voting rights. 
  The penalties provided for contravention of the provisions 
of 
the Act have also been revised upwards so that they have the 
necessary deterrent effect. For contraventions or defaults by 
persons, the penalty has been raised from Rs 2,000 [rupees] to a 
minimum of Rs 50,000, while for banking companies, the penalty 
has been increased from Rs 2,000 to a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs. 
  The promulgation of an ordinance to bring about the changes 
in the Act underlines the urgency the government attaches to the 
setting up of banks in the private sector. The Reserve Bank of 
India has cleared a number of proposals from the private sector 
to set up banks. They, however, could not start operation 
without the necessary changes in the Act. The demand to raise 
the ceiling on voting rights was made by promoters of private 
sector banks, including Mr S.P. Hinduja who is one of the 
promoters of the proposed Indusind Bank. 
  The provision to split the post of chairman and managing 
director will not only allow the private sector banks with the 
flexibility of choosing between the two managerial structures (a 
full-time chairman-cum-managing director or a part-time chairman 
plus a managing director), but will also enable the government 
to bring about a change at the top management of the 
nationalised banks. 
  The finance ministry is reportedly keen on changing the top 
heavy structure of the banks to infuse a sense of team work in 
the emerging competitive environment. In the case of some of the 
nationalised banks, there is virtually no communication between 
the chairmen and managing directors and the executive directors. 
Feed-back from many executive directors indicates that the chief 
executives will often keep them underutilised or keep them away 
from important portfolios. The splitting of the post of chairman 
and managing director will bring about a system in which the 
chairman will be free to concentrate on business strategies and 
policy issues, whereas the operational aspects can be looked 
after by the managing director.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 29--A five-hour long meeting today 
between the Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and 
leaders of trade unions, including those from the banking 
industry, failed to find a common ground to proceed with the 
financial sector reforms. Despite an assurance from the Minister 
that there would be no retrenchment, the unions stuck to their 
threat of a country-wide bank strike on February 17. 
  While the Minister invited the unions to "join the 
Government 
to write a new chapter in the history of the Indian banking 
system," the unions presented their own plan of action for 
revamping it. They opposed any privatisation and protested 
against the Government move to offload 49 per cent of bank 
equity to the public. 
  The unions alleged that the current sickness in the banking 
sector was the result of decision by authorities which had 
allowed "unconcealed political use of banks and their 
resources." They said three-fourths of the outstanding debts of 
the banking sector were directly attributable to the corporate 
sector. The Government, instead of taking corrective action, was 
now planning to hand over the banks to the same private sector. 
  Punishment demanded: The union leaders demanded 
that the default in repayment of bank loans be made a criminal 
offence and that the names of the defaulters be published. The 
official response was that ten tribunals would be set up shortly 
to recover bad debts. 
  On his part, Dr. Singh emphasised the need for banking 
reforms and sought the cooperation of the unions in making the 
Indian banking system vibrant and efficient. 
  Referring to the apprehensions in the minds of workers about 
the closure of bank branches, he said inevitable and necessary 
changes had to be made, but the interest of the workers would be 
protected. Some changes had to be made if India wanted to be a 
major player in the global economy. 
  Dr. Singh stressed that the reform process set in motion 
would create employment opportunities commensurate with the 
rising expectations of the people. He also said the Government 
wanted to have a standing mechanism for continuing the dialogue 
with the trade unions so that there could be pooling of 
knowledge and experience. 
  The Minister said while India had to evolve a banking 
structure suited to the needs of the economy, it could not 
ignore development in other countries either. While conditions 
prevailing in Europe and the United States were very different, 
India could study what countries in Asia were doing to modernise 
their banking systems. 
  Concessions opposed: According to trade union 
sources, during the discussion, the banking unions and central 
trade union leaders opposed to the granting of unrestricted 
concessions to foreign banks. The leaders made it clear that the 
country required an effective and depoliticised banking system, 
run on professional lines and not thoughtless implementation of 
the Narasimham Committee report. 
  While agreeing with the Minister on the need for 
restructuring the commercial banking sector, the unions 
cautioned against any hasty move and suggested that the reforms 
process be spread over a six or seven-year period. They also 
argued for the setting up of an independent audit and vigilance 
commission to look into the banking irregularities. 
  The union leaders suggested that the appointment of Chairmen 
and other top executives be made through a high-power banking 
service commission. They argued for setting up of an overseas 
banking corporation comprising all public sector banks abroad, 
besides pleading for stringent and effective inspections of 
banks to check irregularities and minimise corruption. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of the National 
Front of Trade Unions, Indian National Trade Union Congress, 
All-India Trade Union Congress, National Labour Organisation, 
Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, United Trade Union Centre (LS), Centre 
for Indian Trade Unions, etc. 
  The bank unions included the National Organisation of Bank 
Officers, Indian Bank Employees Federation, the All-India Bank 
Officers Confederation, the All-India Bank Officers Association 
and the National Confederation of Bank Employees. 
  From the official side, the Finance Minister was assisted by 
the Finance Secretary, the Banking Secretary, the Insurance 
Secretary and the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr. C. Rangarajan.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 25--The President, Mr. S.D. Sharma, 
today issued an ordinance giving effect to the new mineral 
policy which opens up the non-energy mining sector to private 
enterprise, both domestic and foreign. 
  The ordinance amends the Mines and Minerals (regulation and 
development) Act, 1957, to achieve the objective. 
  The national mineral policy, announced in March last year, 
had dispensed with the reservation of all the 13 minerals for 
exclusive exploitation by the public sector and sought to invite 
foreign investment in the mining sector. 
  The minerals dereserved are iron ore, manganese, chrome, 
sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, 
tungsten, nickel and platinum.--UNI

zinc-lead ores, molybdenum, gypsum, tungsten and others, but 
coal, lignite and atomic minerals are still retained in the list 
for the public sector. 
  The new policy favours induction of foreign technology and 
participation in mineral exploration and mining for high-value 
and scarce minerals. Foreign equity investment in joint ventures 
in mining, promoted by Indian companies, will be encouraged. 
While foreign investment in equity will normally be limited to 
50 per cent, this limitation will not apply to captive mines of 
any mineral processing industry. Enhanced equity holding can 
also be considered on a case-to-case basis, says the official 
statement. 
  In respect of joint venture mining projects for minerals and 
metals in which the country is deficient or does not have an 
exportable surplus, a stipulated share of production will have 
to be made available to meet the needs of the domestic market 
before exports from such projects are allowed. 
  The country has vast mineral resources, but mining small 
deposits scattered all over the country poses problems for big 
public sector ventures. The private sector can tap this market 
with modest investments and short lead times. 
  Mining, being labour-intensive, can open up job 
opportunities 
in backward areas. Efforts will be made to promote small scale 
mining in a scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding 
vital environmental and ecological imperatives, says the 
official statement. 
  The management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be 
closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and 
exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national 
goals and perspectives. It is against this backdrop, the 
Government has felt the need to spell out the features of its 
new policy, the statement said. But the delay in the amendment 
of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957 
has created some confusion in the field. 
  Admittedly, the country is not endowed with rich resources 
of 
high grade ores in strategic areas except bauxite and iron ore. 
This underlines the need for adopting scientific mining, 
together with beneficiation processes for economic utilisation 
of the available mineral resources. Mineral economists however 
agree that progress in this direction over the the past three 
decades has been rather tardy except in some sectors. 
<H5>  Focus on future needs </H5>
  At the same time, the Government has to keep in view the 
future needs of defence and development and try to ensure 
indigenous availability of basic and strategic minerals to avoid 
disruption of supplies during emergency. 
  The national mineral policy has also focussed on aspects 
like 
sea-bed mining, development of proper inventory, linkage between 
exploitation of minerals and development of mineral industry, 
conservation of forest resources and protection of environment. 
  The Centre will consult the States before formulating legal 
measures for the regulation of mines and the development of 
mineral resources to ensure basic uniformity in mineral 
administration and development of the industry in tune with the 
national policy aims. The new policy aims at exploring mineral 
wealth in the land and in the off-shore areas; developing 
mineral resources taking into account the national and strategic 
considerations and ensuring their adequate supply and best use 
keeping in view the present needs and future requirements; and 
promoting necessary linkages for smooth and uninterrupted 
development of the mineral industry to meet domestic needs. 
  In the development of the mineral industry the role of the 
Government, both Central and States, has been spelt out in the 
1957 Act. This Act has been amended through an ordinance issued 
recently to accommodate the reforms envisaged by the Centre in 
this field. It is time the Government updates the national 
mineral inventory before it opens up this sector to the private 
sector, both domestic and foreign. 
  The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will be the principal 
outfit for geological mapping and regional mineral resources 
assessment including in its exclusive economic zone. It will 
continue to be responsible to draw up action-oriented plans in 
association with other agencies.

  Special attention will be given to the development of 
strategic minerals through systematic investigation of various 
potential sources of supply. Further, the focus will be on the 
survey and exploration of minerals in which the country has a 
poor or just adequate resource base. 
<H5>  Ecological problems </H5>
  Environmental problems associated with mining activity, 
particularly open cast mining, land subsidence in underground 
mining, deforestation and atmospheric pollution call for 
appropriate strategy for mitigation of their adverse effects on 
the eco-system. The new policy says that mining operations shall 
not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile 
and biologically rich areas. Strip mining in forest areas should 
be avoided in accordance with prescribed norms and established 
forestry practices shall form an integral part of mine 
development strategy. 
  The research and development (R&amp;D) activities will 
focus on 
the entire gamut of activities from geological survey, 
exploration, mining, beneficiation and extraction of minerals to 
development of materials. The new policy seeks to promote 
development of new technologies for conversion of existing 
mineral resources into viable economic resources. Appropriate 
technologies shall be developed to enable indigenous industries 
to utilise the available resources and as substitutes for 
minerals whose reserves are poor. 
  The R&amp;D efforts shall be directed to find new and 
alternative 
uses for minerals whose traditional demand is on the wane, says 
the statement. Indigenous technology has to be upgraded through 
R &amp; D and adoption of technological innovations from abroad. 
Research in mining methods shall also receive priority attention. 
  The liberalisation of imports and reduction of customs duty 
on finished metals like copper, zinc and aluminium, has hit 
companies like Hindustan [HCL] Copper, Hindustan Zinc [HZL] and 
National Aluminium. 
  While the Government has dereserved 15 minerals, ilmenite, 
siliminate and mica have been kept out of this list. Bauxite 
also does not appear in the deleted list although India ranks 
fifth among bauxite rich countries in the world. 
  According to Mr. I.G. Jhingran, Secretary to Union Ministry 
of Mines, liberalisation of the mining policy will help 
indigenous companies to foster closer ties with mineral-rich 
Third World countries for joint exploration and development of 
ore resources. 
  Hindustan Copper could explore the possibility of joining 
hands with Zambia which has rich copper ore deposits for 
exploration and tie up imports of the richer grade ores for 
blending with its low grade material. It has acquired 
considerable expertise in mining and smelting operations. 
Similarly, HZL also could go global with its expertise skills to 
find partners abroad to develop the mineral deposits in Third 
World countries. HCL is now free to even enter the metal trade. 
For expanding its Khetri copper smelter capacity from 35,000 
tonnes to one lakh tonnes a year, it could source ore imports 
from Zambia to make its products competitive in the market. 
  These public sector companies are moving from an era of 
protection to a competitive market and they should tap all 
avenues to make their operations economically viable. HZL is 
exploring the scope for setting up a joint venture in Vietnam 
for developing a gold ore deposit in collaboration with BRGM 
[Geological and Mineral Research] of France. 
  Mr. A.C. Wadhawan, Chairman, HZL, says some Australian 
companies have evinced interest in exploration activities for 
base metal ores, including gold, in India. The finds in 
Karnataka and other southern States are promising for further 
evaluation and assessment. These projects for transition need 
long gestation period. 
  If, meanwhile, LME zinc prices continue to drop, HZL may 
find 
itself in an unenviable position as the Government is unlikely 
to give it any budgetary support to weather the storm. The 
Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., with special skills in 
exploration activities, is facing a bleak future as it may run 
out of business if foreign mining companies enter the field. It 
will have to seek foreign collaboration for survival and 
technology upgradation. 
  Its capacity utilisation has dropped in 1992-93 as the 
public 
sector mining companies are starved of funds. Even the GSI is 
now being asked to gear up to become market-oriented and try to 
earn its keep, at least partly. It now remains to be seen how 
the mining reforms will help the development of this core 
industry and whether it will lure foreign investment for the 
industry's rapid development.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 29 (PTI)--The Department of 
Fertilisers will undertake a unit-wise review of all public 
sector undertakings producing di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 
complexes to ensure efficiency is improved and production costs 
are cut. 
  The Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers, Mr 
Eduardo Faleiro, told a meeting of his Ministry's parliamentary 
consultative committee today that the Government would encourage 
Indian companies to set up joint ventures in countries which had 
huge gas reserves to fill the gap between demand and production 
of nitrogen, equivalent to 41.4 lakh tonnes of urea, at the end 
of the Eighth Plan. 
  Efforts were already on to have tie-ups in Oman, Qatar and 
Iran, he added. 
  Mr. Faleiro said if proper balance in the use of plant 
nutrients was not ensured it would have long-term adverse 
effects on soil fertility unless efforts were made to arrest the 
trend. 
  This trend, he said, was primarily because of imbalance in 
the relative prices of urea and DAP, MoP [muriate of potash] and 
complexes. 
  Mr. Faleiro said the ratio in the use of nitrogen, phosphate 
and potash had been adversely affected during the last two 
cropping seasons. 
  This trend, he said, could not be arrested despite the 
Government's concessions in the form of enhanced support prices 
of foodgrains to compensate for the extra expenditure incurred 
on phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, special concession of 
1,000 per tonne on the sale of indigenous DAP and proportionate 
concession on complex fertilisers and SSP [single super 
phosphate]. 
  The Minister said the Indian fertiliser industry was 
extremely efficient and comparable to international standards. 
It could produce additional quantities of urea at prices lower 
than those of imported ones provided additional quantities of 
gas were available. 
  KRIBHCO alone could add two lakh tonnes to the annual 
production if it was provided with 0.5 mms cmd of gas. At 
present, 70 per cent of the Indian production in urea was 
internationally competitive. 
  Mr Faleiro stressed the need to activate extension services 
and educate farmers about the benefits of balanced use of 
fertilisers so that they would desist from injudicious use of 
any one nutrient. 
  The farmers would also be educated on the cost-effectiveness 
of manures and other organic fertilisers which could 
successfully supplement the chemical fertilisers.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 2 (PTI)--The government today 
announced significant changes to the Companies Act ensuring 
greater freedom to companies in managerial appointments and 
remuneration. 
  Under the changes to schedule XIII of the Act, which comes 
into effect from February 1, a company with adequate net profits 
will now have full freedom to work out a suitable remuneration 
package for its managerial personnel within the limit of 5 per 
cent of its net profits if it has one, and 10 per cent of its 
net profits, if it has more than one managerial person, 
according to an official announcement here. 
  In the event of absence or inadequacy of net profits in any 
financial year (where managerial remuneration exceeds 5 per cent 
or 10 per cent of net profits), managerial remuneration will 
have to be limited to amounts (varying from Rs 40,000 [rupees] a 
month to Rs 87,000 depending on the effective capital of the 
company) specified in section II of part II of the schedule. 
  The fresh changes will make it easier for companies to 
attract the best available managerial talents on better terms 
and conditions. 
  In July, 1993, the government had effected sweeping changes 
in the Companies Act raising salary and prerequisite limits from 
Rs 1.80 lakhs and Rs 1.35 lakhs per annum, respectively, to Rs 6 
lakhs and Rs 4.50 lakhs per annum. 
  It had also withdrawn the ceiling on commission on net 
profits. Mandatory 10 per cent reduction in salary in the event 
of absence or inadequacy of profits was stopped and loss-making 
companies were delegated powers to appoint managerial personnel 
without Central government's approval on a par with 
profit-making companies. 
  Under the new changes, remuneration under section II of part 
II of the Act may be paid as "minimum remuneration" without the 
approval of the Central government. 
  The official release said loss-making companies or companies 
with inadequate net profits have the freedom to work out 
suitable remuneration packages for their managerial personnel 
within the limits specified in the stipulated section. 
  Approval of the Central government will now be required by 
companies in regard to managerial remuneration only if the 
remuneration is in excess of the limits (related to the 
effective capital of the company) specified in section II of 
part II of the schedule. 
  The condition that a sick company should seek government 
clearance for appointment of managerial personnel has been 
withdrawn, according to the announcement. 
  It says approval of the Centre is no longer required for a 
managing director or manager of a company to become managing 
director or manager of another company provided he opts to draw 
remuneration from only one of the two companies. 
  Even in regard to such managerial personnel who are already 
in position on the date of the amendment in the schedule, 
companies may themselves raise their remuneration, from a date 
not earlier than February 1, 1994, without the approval of the 
Central government. 
  This may be done even where the earlier 
appointment/remuneration had been approved by the Centre in 
accordance with the provisions of schedule XIII save and except 
in those cases where the Centre had given conditional approval 
in such cases.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 29--The President, Dr. Shankar Dayal 
Sharma, tonight promulgated an Ordinance turning Indian Airlines 
and Air India into two public limited companies, ending state 
monopoly in the aviation sector. 
  With the repeal of the Air Corporation Act, 1953, the 
monopoly of Indian Airlines and Air India to operate scheduled 
flights has been ended. Simultaneously, the operations of 
private air taxis have been given the sanction of law. 
  The Air Transport (Transfer and Repeal of Undertakings) 
Ordinance comes in place of a Bill with a similar title, which 
had been introduced in Parliament some 18 months ago. The 
ordinance was enacted owing to lack of time available to 
Parliament to pass the Bill. 
  During the last session of Parliament, the Bill was listed 
for enactment, but again other commitments prevented its 
passage. Given the fact that the coming Budget Session, too, 
will be hectic, the Government, instead, chose to issue an 
ordinance. 
  In 1990, the then V.P. Singh Government had allowed the 
operations of private air taxis in the country, but legal 
sanction eluded these "unscheduled airlines." 
  In fact, there has been a general clamour from private air 
taxis operators that the Air Corporation Act, which give only 
Indian Airlines and Air India the right to operate scheduled air 
services, be repealed. 
  With the promulgation of the ordinance, Indian Airlines and 
Air India, have been placed at par with private airlines as far 
as domestic operations go, though only these two companies can 
fly to destinations abroad. 
  According to government sources, this is one of the first 
major steps taken to denationalise the public sector. Though 
there have been demands from the private industry to 
de-monopolise the aviation industry, the employees of these air 
corporations have been against such a move. 
  With the repeal of the act, the age of "open skies" has 
dawned in the country. Private air lines, finally, have been 
conferred legal status. 
  PTI reports from Bombay: 
  A spokesman of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association said 
the measure was not going to be healthy. 
  The Air Corporation Employees Union Regional Secretary, Mr 
R. Ramanathan, said "our campaign and struggle will further 
intensify."

<F P=106> [Article by Srinivas Laxman: "Guarded Optimism Greets </F>
Ordinance"] 
  [Text] Bombay, January 30--The repeal of the Air 
Corporations Act, 1963, is being viewed with guarded optimism 
because aviation executives fear that it could be merely a 
cosmetic change. 
  Certainly, there has been a demand among top echelons of the 
nation's aviation industry that the Air Corporations Act be 
scrapped as it had ceased to have any relevance. 
  But, the question being asked today is will its removal mean 
that Indian civil aviation will really begin to take to the 
skies? 
  According to them, for the industry to take off in a big way 
the outlook of the large militant aviation work force has to 
undergo a big change. Otherwise, scrapping of the Act will 
simply have no meaning at all. 
  Though Air-India and Indian Airlines executives described 
Saturday night's Presidential promulgation as a new chapter in 
the history of Indian civil aviation, the unions predictably 
have opposed it. 
  "We are opposing it," was the response of the general 
secretary of the Air Corporations Employees Union (ACEU), Mr R. 
Ramanathan. 
  Mr Ramanathan said that when the matter was before 
Parliament 
there was absolutely no need for the Presidential proclamation. 
  He also said that there was a public interest litigation 
before the Calcutta high court challenging the validity of the 
licenses given to air taxi operators. The matter before the 
Calcutta high court would now have no meaning on account of the 
Presidential Ordinance, he regretted. 
  While most of the aviation unions have been against the Act 
being scrapped for fear that their jobs would be at stake, only 
the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG), the representative body of 
Air-India pilots, has adopted a broad-minded view on this 
controversial issue. 
  Said the IPG president, Captain V.M. Mayadev: "With the 
economic scenario in the country undergoing a change, I feel 
reforms have to be accepted." 
  It may be recalled that it was only this organisation--the 
IPG--which stated with some amount of reservations of course, 
that it would not oppose changes when its members deposed before 
the Mahajan Commission in New Delhi last year. 
  The Act's repeal undoubtedly marks a major setback for the 
unions who have all along tried to retain it. They organised 
strikes, lunch-hour demonstrations and walk-outs, all of which 
proved futile. 
  To convince them that under the liberalised economic 
scenario, the Act had no place proved a herculean task. Now the 
unions have lost their battle. 
  It is felt that they should gracefully accept defeat and 
tell 
their members the need to accept reforms in their own interest. 
The message is that from now on they have to think big and not 
be bogged down by narrow personal interests. Otherwise the 
Act's repeal will have no meaning. 
  The unions have really nothing to fear because when the 
process of disinvestment begins they too would be given a share. 
Which means that they too would have a say in the functioning of 
both airlines and thus their interests would be fully protected. 
  Right now, the two new companies Air-India Limited and 
Indian 
Airlines Limited--whose offices are registered in New Delhi will 
be cent per cent government-owned. [sentence as printed] 
Functionally, therefore, one cannot expect any significant 
changes at the moment. For the changes to start, the process of 
disinvestment would have to be initiated in the next few months. 
  As a prelude to the Presidential ordinance, the Air-India 
and 
Indian Airlines boards were reconstituted a fortnight ago. Some 
of the new A-I board members are, apart from the chairman and 
managing director, Mr Yogesh Deveshwar, Mr P.K. Banerjee, Mr 
Brijesh Kumar, Mr Vijay Madan and Mr R. Krishnamurthy. 
  Speaking to TOINS this morning, Mr Deveshwar said that he 
was 
happy that the Act had been repealed and he "looked forward to a 
new era in civil aviation." 
  "I would welcome this change," said Mr M.R. Pai, who has 
been 
championing the cause of air passengers. But, he added that it 
should have been done through an Act passed through Parliament 
rather than a Presidential Ordinance. 
  "At the moment the scenario in Indian Airlines was such that 
it was run 50 per cent by politics, 25 per cent by bureaucracy, 
there was 15 per cent staff militancy and only 10 per cent 
professionalism," Mr Pai regretted. 
  The repeal of the Act has at last legitimised the operations 
of the air taxi operators. 
  From last night following the promulgation of the ordinance, 
they ceased to be "air taxi operators," but full-fledged 
"airlines." Among the benefits they can now enjoy is that they 
would be able to publish their schedules. "We now enjoy a legal 
status and we are all very happy," said the managing director of 
East West Airlines, Mr T.A. Wahid. 
  With the operations of these new private airlines having a 
legal sanctity, the much-publicised "Open Skies" policy would 
have some significance from now on. 
  On the other hand there is understandable apprehension in 
some quarters whether the `Open Skies' policy means a sellout of 
our skies to foreign multinational air carriers. 
  Aviation experts feel that while any form of liberalisation 
is welcome, the country's aviation industry should not be taken 
over by foreign airlines.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Destination Nowhere"] </F>
  [Text] That the Air Corporation Act, 1953, setting up a 
monopoly in airline services within the country has been 
repealed is welcome in principle but doubts persist over the 
Government's motives. The creation of Indian Airlines Ltd and 
Air India Ltd has been hanging in the air since May 1992, when 
the appropriate Bill was introduced in Parliament, but not 
pursued. Now the deed is done by Ordinance, bypassing 
Parliament, an entirely avoidable and thoroughly objectionable 
procedure. The Government needs to be reminded that the 
Ordinance-making power is reserved for special circumstances and 
must be used with care. No reasons have been given but it is 
quite clear that the urgency is only to collect some big money, 
and quickly, to make up for the massive fiscal deficit the 
Government has run up this year. If a proper debate had been 
allowed in the passage of the Bill through Parliament, not only 
would adverse inferences not been drawn but it would have 
blundered the opposition to the Ordinance, now building up. It 
would also have helped the Government to make up its mind on how 
to go about the privatization and what to do with the proceeds. 
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry wants the 
Government to set up a Ministry for Privatization to ensure a 
well-structured policy on selection, degree and time frame for 
the privatization plan. It is a mistake to assume that a proper 
plan can only be made by a separate Ministry; a stronger 
objection is that a Ministry once created tends to be permanent 
and continues long after its need has passed. But the problem 
clearly has to be tackled. No homework has been done, details of 
the pricing policy are not known, and the mechanism for the sale 
of equity unclear. The last time round the disinvestment of 
public sector equity got mired in unsavoury allegations 
featuring the Allahabad Bank and a set of brokers. The entire 
business was severely criticized by the Public Accounts 
Committee. A strategy of openness would be advisable now, 
especially when the goings on in the financial sector are so 
murky. 
  Essentially, privatization should result in efficient 
management; it is not intended to be used to fund the continued 
profligacy of an unrepentant Government. The National Renewal 
Fund, which privatization was supposed to support, has gone 
awry, while workers have had to accept retrenchment or continue 
to remain in service without pay. There are another 47 public 
sector units under the Board for Industrial and Financial 
Reconstruction, which face a bleak future because nobody quite 
knows the gameplan. The only thing that is clear is that there 
is dash for cash before February 28. With vision so myopic, the 
repeal of this Act may not mean any meaningful change in the 
maharaja-style attitudes of the two airlines. Unless the nation 
is vigilant, the exercise may only provide the wherewithal to 
sustain the maharaja-style bureaucracy, while the airliners 
continue to land in pools of deep red ink.

  [Text] New Delhi--The Germans are eager to start their news 
service DPA [Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH] from India and when 
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visits Germany next month 
there will be considerable pressure for his support for this 
media project which will enhance German influence in India. 
  However, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Bhaskar 
Ghose 
said there was no move so far to review the landmark Cabinet 
decisions of 1955 and 1956 which forbids publication of 
foreign-owned newspapers and the operation of foreign news 
agencies in India. The Ministry, he said, had not forwarded any 
such proposal to the Cabinet. 
  The aim of the 1955 regulation is to protect the Indian 
newspaper industry from foreign competition. 
  The 1956 Cabinet noting on the wire services says no news 
agency can operate directly from India. Whatever stories they 
wish to distribute in India have to be through the Indian news 
agencies PTI and UNI after being whetted by them. 
  Foreign news agencies have been making several attempts to 
operate from India. 
  But in the wake of economic liberalisation certain sections 
of the government, including the Finance Ministry, are said to 
be eager to open up the media too. 
  In the last couple of years foreign newspapers and wire 
services have been desperate to get a toe-hold in India so that 
they have better and faster dispersal of their publications and 
services in the region. 
  Towards the end of 1992 international lending agencies like 
IMF, World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank put pressure on 
Manmohan Singh and the Reserve Bank to improve the financial 
information services and allow operation of financial news 
services like Knight Ridder and Telerad (both British). In 
violation of the 1956 regulation they were given permission. 
However, I&amp;B ministry is believed to have opposed it. After 
this 
REUTER de-linked its financial news from PTI and has been coming 
out as a separate service from India for distribution to special 
clients. 
  At one stage the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, with the 
support of the Hindujas, wanted to come out from India. Though 
the proposal was supported by Manmohan Singh, it did not go 
through. 
  But in the brief tenure of former Prime Minister Chandra 
Shekhar, a FINANCIAL TIMES of London and Modi's tieup was 
approved. 
  The approval was given by the Industry Ministry as an 
industrial venture without considering the relevant press laws 
or getting the Information and Broadcasting Ministry support. 
Subsequently the Modis backed out of the project and Aveek 
Sarkar of Ananda Bazar Patrika stepped in as the partner using 
the same approval. 
  TIME magazine too is eager to publish from India and Living 
Media Ltd, publishers of INDIA TODAY magazine, has applied for 
clearing of the project.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 31--In yet another addition to 
India's missile capabilities, the Defence Research and 
Development Organisation (DRDO) has successfully carried out 
flight tests on the sophisticated anti-tank missile, Nag. 
Despite four tests in the last two days on the advanced 
projectile, the weapon may have to wait two years before it is 
inducted in the country's arsenal, the Defence Ministry 
indicated. 
  The tests follow the successful induction of the 150 to 250 
km range, Surface to Surface Prithvi missile in the forces. 
India's efforts to develop a 2,000-km range IRBM, "Agni" is also 
expected to take a step forward. Postponed recently, a third 
test on the Agni is also widely anticipated. 
  Capable of piercing the most advanced of tank armours, the 
missile can be launched either from a tracked vehicle or from a 
helicopter. In the recent tests, it was fired from a tracked 
vehicle, developed by the DRDO in partnership with Indian 
industry. 
  The missile's 4 km. range is matched by a "fire and forget" 
capability. Once a target is sighted, the missile automatically 
aligns to it. The time saved in engaging targets allows the 
weapon to be fired at a rapid rate, thereby adding to its punch. 
  Among other capabilities, the Nag has "top attack" features. 
Taking advantage of the fact that the armour is the thinnest at 
the top, it homes on to upper areas of a tank (usually the 
turret). 
  To make the missile light without reducing strength, its 
airframe is made of composite materials. Foldable wings enable 
the missile to be launched by a tube. The casing of the 
propulsion system is made of high strength aluminum alloys. 
  A tandem shaped charge warhead is made of a thinner front, 
shielding the main charge. Since reactive armours feature on 
most contemporary tanks (this armour explodes on impact thereby 
neutralising an incoming charge) the front portion of the 
warhead on the Nag has been designed to take this impact. Having 
seen through the reactive armour explosion, the full caliber 
main charge thereafter breaches the tank.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iran Buys 5 Oil Tankers From South </F>
Korea"] 
  [Text] TEHRAN Feb. 19 (Dispatches) -- Iran has bought five 
oil tankers from South Korea for $490m to modernize its fleet, 
an oil ministry official said Saturday. 
  Mohammad Suri, quoted by the official news agnecy IRNA, said 
the tankers would be delivered to Iran in two years. Iran 
purchased the tankers on credit and will have to pay off the 
amount in 10 years, he added. 
  Suri, the director general of Iranian tankers company, said 
there were presently 29 oil tankers with the capacity of 5.4m 
tons in the Iranian fleet. 
  He said the tankers transported for exports one-third of the 
Iranian crude, estimated at one million barrels per day. 
  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said on his 
return from a trip to South Korea in October that the two 
countries had agreed on taking out a loan to buy oil tankers. 
  South Korea is one of Iran's major commercial partners and 
trade between the two countries stood at $1.7b in 1992. Tehran 
sells Seoul 160,000 barrels of crude per day.

  [Text] In the government-proposed budget for the year 
beginning 21 March 1994, the most striking points are the 
unprecedented 47% rise in the government's budget, and 
the 60% 
jump in state-owned companies' budget. This request for 
statutory endorsement takes place at a time when the 
government's oil revenue, affected by the price crash, not only 
has declined and its future because of the slack world demand, 
is dim, but, as a consequence of the credit boycott, which has 
been imposed on the Iranian state for some time now, a major 
portion of oil receipts has to go into paying up the Central 
Bank's almost $13 billion[b] matured debts better known as 
"overdues." 
  It was due to those very short-term and costly foreign debts 
that the government resorted recently to a policy of eliminating 
the non-government demand for hard currency. As a result, 
imports of raw and complementary materials and machinery parts 
for industries have come to an almost standstill. But on the 
other hand, no change has been made in the government 
undertaking as regards to paying "consumer" subsidies, among 
which the fuel subsidy alone comes up to somewhere around $10b a 
year. Moreover, the measure to transfer to the public the state 
companies and units for which, despite the fall in activities, a 
monstrous budget of Rls 56,000b[rials] has been proposed, has 
come to a halt because of lack of a strong, tactful, resolved 
caretaker. 
  In this way the government intends to secure before anything 
else the personnel budget of its organizations and units, 
whether active or semi-active, and also to provide the necessary 
financial resources for carrying out the "manpower adjustment" 
policy in factories facing a cut in production caused by the 
lack of raw materials. Furthermore, the government prefers for 
the time being to continue paying consumer subsidies, which are 
mostly on foodstuffs, fuel, medicine, domestic flights and 
pilgrimage tours. But then, this method of tackling the problem 
of employment and earnings is, due to its human factor, a 
particularly sensitive social issue, will prove fictitious in 
the medium run with negative economic sequels. 
  While the government sticks to paying consumer subsidies and 
the economy's tax paying power is waning, the major outlet for 
financing the government's continuous budget deficit will be the 
Central Bank and taking advantage of the country's banking 
system. And both these sources are, incidentally, extremely 
inflationary. 
  In other words, the inflation arising from the increase in 
the government budget and unproductive subsidized expenses is 
outwardly delusive in the short run, for it will produce a false 
impression that the problems of production and employment have 
somehow been desirably solved. Whereas the very existence of 
abundant money and liquidity will, in the medium run, leave 
devastating, inhibitive marks on the level of employment and the 
income of labor power. People will become more and more inclined 
to converting their money into land, property, gold and hard 
currency. The inflationary visions spiral will gulp down all the 
sinking-funds of industries and social security and retirement 
savings and do away with all incentives for productive 
investment. 
  In order to neutralize the inflationary sequels of the 
government proposed budget for next year, the following measures 
need to be taken: 
  1. The Islamic Majles should adjust the proposed funds at a 
reasonable single-digit inflation level; 
  2. Instead of spending thousands of billions of rials on 
keeping the state companies up, the government should as soon as 
possible transfer these units at a suitable price and by 
long-term installments to the public, experts and the personnel 
of the same units. Besides, the banking facilities asked for by 
the government should be made available to the private sector; 
  3. Except for the low-income and downtrodden strata, the 
government subsidies on pilgrimage tours, domestic flights, 
basic goods, fuels, etc should be phased out; 
  4. The Central Bank should be accorded greater independence 
to issue rial bonds in domestic markets and foreign exchange 
bonds in the world market and to show sensitivity to any decline 
in the rial's purchasing power and to be answerable to the 
public through the legislative branch. 
  Foreign Debts: Until now the role of the oil 
export earnings has been to shore up the government's general 
budget and meet part of the general spending. 
  However, as of 21 March 1993, the oil revenues have come to 
assume a dual (domestic-foreign) role. The continuation of the 
government budget movement, on the one hand, and of the process 
of repaying the foreign debts, on the other, is now mainly 
dependent on crude oil exports. Thus, with the scarcity of the 
revenue resulting from oil exports and the maturing of foreign 
debts the authorities have three courses in front of them: 
  First--Giving priority to domestic exchange expenditure and 
deferring the debts further. 
  Second--Giving priority to foreign debt payment and assuming 
a period of austerity at home. 
  Third--Choosing a middle course and earmark the hard 
currency 
partly for home and partly for foreign purposes. 
  Apparently, the best course is the third one. But then this 
is when the share portions for domestic exchange requirements 
and foreign exchange requirements grow equally and at a limited 
fashion. 
  What has been proposed in the 1994-5 budget bill is for 
repaying just one billion dollars, and this means we have chosen 
the first course, i.e. giving priority to domestic exchange 
expenses and postponing the debts further. Whereas, foresight 
rules that we opt for the second course in the 94-5 budget for 
the following reasons: 
  1. The more we delay our debt, the bigger its principal and 
interest will become. 
  2. On-time repayment of debts does not push up the interest 
progressively. So, preparation in the 94-5 budget for paying a 
bigger portion of the debts could mean reduction in the debt 
burden in the future. 
  3. The experience of the highly debtor countries indicates 
that deferral, reborrowing and going round again have been one 
of the causes of their accumulated foreign debts... 
  4. Contrary to what some believe that today's world is the 
world of debts and so one should not be worried, our 
indebtedness is very much different from the indebtedness of, 
say, Brazil or Argentina. Because the West helps those countries 
to solve their problem...But with us...it stops at nothing to 
strike a blow at the Islamic system. 
  5. Neither the world oil price nor our exports are reliable 
for repaying the debts on time. And so, the sooner the debts are 
paid the more we can avoid the oil market fluctuations and debt 
crisis... 
  Liquidity &amp; Inflation: According to the 1994-5 
budget bill, state-owned companies add Rls 4,365b to the 
government's debt to the banking system, for they don't pay back 
a major part of the loans thay have received. 
  Unfortunately, there is a big gap between the credits 
granted 
to the people and to the government sectors. In the 1994-5 
budget bill the government instructs the banks to provide Rls 
7,598b in credits to government-affiliated units and Rls 1,565b 
for the private sector. Among the government establishments too 
a huge portion goes to oil, gas, petrochemical, underground 
transportation system, steel, aviation and sugar-cane projects. 
  If the credits prescribed for the banks are set next year at 
the same levels indicated above and the private sector receives 
as much credits as it received this year, the liquidity 
expansion will exceed 25%. And this would bear no 
relation to 
the average 11.7% set by the Second Five-Year Development 
Plan. 
  Since the rate of inflation has hitherto grown in pace with 
liquidity, it will be increasing by the same ratio next year. 
And that is if there is no budget deficit, or else liquidity 
would assume a faster rate of expansion. 
  Inflation, however, can be contained through controlling the 
credit ceiling. One should at least avoid to extend credits to 
those investments which have no economic justification and whose 
repayment by state companies is not possible. Otherwise, this 
would be considered a kind of budget deficit and could generate 
inflation. 
  As for the banking system, its organizational structure has 
to be reformed and revised. The administrative, organizational 
and promotional expenses of banks are already very high. 
Besides, the banking network charges credit receivers high 
profit (interest) and surcharges. 
  These have to be reconsidered... The cost-price of money at 
our banks is high compared with what it should be, and the 
penalty is paid by the public. 
  One of the problems relating to how banks are managed is the 
composition of the Money and Credit Council. A noticeable number 
of its members are from the credit-using ministries. In order to 
reform the monetary system, the composition of the Money and 
Credit Council has to change with mostly organizational-economic 
officials and economic pundits, not credit-users, being on it. 
Also, to reform the economic decison-making system the 
composition of the Council of Economy has to be altered. Because 
the consumer establishments are in the majority in this council 
and they push the latter's decisions towards being uneconomic. 
  A problem with the banks is that they have come to own 
companies. These should be transferred to the people as soon as 
possible. Direct investment accounting for 50% of the 
share 
should also be delegated to the people. 
  As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the 
banks 
too must come out of monopoly within the rules of Islam and the 
Constitution. Non-bank credit institutions should be allowed to 
operate so that the grounds for healthy competition would be 
provided. In this way the state banks which now call themselves 
non-government and public would no longer be able to impose all 
sorts of costs on credit users. 
  1 - The amount of loan to be received by some companies from 
the banking system in the year beginning 21 March '94 is like 
this: National Oil Company Rls 1.643b, Continental Shelf Oil 
Company Rls 130b, National Oil Products Distribution Company Rls 
166b, National Gas Company Rls 226b, Power Generational and 
Transmission Company of Iran (Tavanir) Rls 427b, National 
Iranian Steel Corp Rls 280b, (Esfahan) Steel Mill Rls 100b, 
Mobarakeh Steel Rls 120b, National Petrochemical Company Rls 
1,062b, IRI Airline Rls 150b, Iranian National Steel Industrial 
Group Rls 100b, Metro Company Rls 100b and Sugar-Cane and 
Ancillary Industries Development Company Rls 500b. 
  2. As a consequence of the budget notes alone 16% 
will be 
added to the liquidity next year.

  [Text] Economic service. Custom duties and tariffs on 
imported goods will increase to protect domestic production. The 
general office of export-import regulations of the Ministry of 
Commerce supports domestic production by establishing custom 
tariffs on imported goods. 
  According to a report from the office of public relations of 
the Ministry of Commerce, the general office of export-import 
regulations have prepared questionnaires for domestic production 
units to describe and list the kinds of similar imported goods 
that are produced domestically, so that the department of 
foreign trade of the Ministry of Commerce may be notified of the 
problem. 
  According to this report, the questionnaires include brand 
names and features of domestically produced goods, volume of 
annual production within the last five years, forecast of future 
production volume, details of the needed imported raw materials 
and their currency cost, the total production cost, and details 
of the imported goods whose counterparts are produced in the 
country.

  [Text] TEHRAN, Feb. 20 (IRNA) -- Commander of the Iranian 
Law Enforcement Forces Major General Reza Seyfollahi here Sunday 
said that 20 drug traffickers were killed and 11 others injured 
when law enforcement agents smashed a drug ring in the 
southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan border province, on Friday. 
  He said the agents arrested another 103 people in the 
operation, which netted 3,287 kilograms (7,246 pounds) of opium. 
  In total, Seyfollahi said, 80,066 kilograms (175,512 pounds) 
of narcotics were confiscated in the past year, an increase of 
about 15,000 kilograms over last year. 
  He said 14,612 traffickers and 43,464 addicts were arrested 
in Iran over the same period. 
  Seyfollahi pointed out that the law enforcement experts had 
made a device to be employed in eight provinces to identify and 
register the number of those addicted to hashish in the country. 
  As for government policy to severe struggle against 
smugglers, General Seyfollahi said that to this end the law 
enforcement forces had carried out several operations in Sistan 
and Baluchestan and the Persian Gulf coastal provinces of 
Bushehr and Hormozgan. [sentence as published]

spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission (CDN), concerning 
precisely the release of administrative detainees in the south 
and the lifting of house arrests, are beginning to be applied. 
According to the president of the National Human Rights 
Observatory (ONDH), Mr. Rezag Bara, there are 780 detainees in 
centers in the south. This figure is disputed by Mr. Yahia 
Adennour, president of the Algerian League for the Defense of 
Human Rights [LADDH], who estimates the number of "internees" at 
about 994 (600 at Ain-M'Guel and 394 at Oued-Namous in the 
Bechar governorate). He also claims that there is a third center 
in the Ouargla governorate, where "detainees are sorted out." 
  In a communique released on 13 December 1993, the LADDH 
observed that about 10,000 individuals had been interned 
"without due process, since the interruption of the electoral 
process." 
  At a press conference held at the end of October, the 
justice 
minister, Mr. Teguia, announced that security centers "had been 
closed." He said that the number of detainees never exceeded 
5,000 (when the centers were set up). Yesterday's release will 
be followed by others, we also learned. However, it is not known 
whether all those detained in these centers will be released. 
The CND spokesman mentioned the release "of a first group of 
detainees." 
  Some of these individuals are expected to have to answer for 
their actions in court (in theory, the Special Courts). Three 
hundred cases are said to have been referred to civil courts. As 
far as house arrests are concerned (which, as is known, are 
administrative measures taken by the Ministry of Interior) we 
learned that they affected some 100 individuals. These include 
in particular militants of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front], the SIT [Islamic Labor Union], and certain associations 
close to Abassi Madani's party. Hamas [Movement of Islamic 
Society] militants residing around Constantine and Ouargla are 
also said to be under house arrest. 
  We should also mention that, according to sources close to 
his lawyers, Ali Belhadj, another leader of the former FIS, was 
just transferred from the Tizi-Ouzou prison to a secret location.

<F P=106> [Article by Khaled Mahrez: "Distribution System Found </F>
Wanting"] 
  [Text] "I defend the idea of truth in pricing. That way, 
everyone will consume according to his means...this will put an 
end to smuggling across the border and to waste," said Mr. 
Mustapha Makraoui, acting commerce minister, in a press 
conference held yesterday at Government House. 
  The acting commerce minister met yesterday with journalists 
to say, first of all, that if there are food shortages, it is 
not because the state has failed to import enough. 
  The minister also challenged government officials to improve 
the output of a "totally foundering" national distribution 
system that engenders only penury and speculation. 
  Typically, Mr. Makraoui first bombarded journalists with 
statistics. Imports for last year were valued at $9 billion, 
including $2.5 billion for food products. Some $700 million went 
for importing hard and soft wheat, corn, rice, and barley, $520 
million for semolina flour, and $54 million for dehydrated 
vegetables. Authorizations for imports by ENAPEL [expansion not 
given] (milk, coffee, sugar, tea, etc.) came to nearly $1 
billion. 
  The commerce minister admitted, however, that these programs 
were not all fully implemented, for several reasons. For 
example, foreign banks were cautious, preferring to wait until 
they knew whether Algeria would negotiate with the IMF in late 
1993. Algeria is also having difficulties acquiring hard wheat 
and semolina on world markets, difficulties that Mr. Makraoui 
ascribes to the decline in world production of hard wheat. Not 
until January did the European countries agree to make available 
300,000 tons of hard wheat and an equal amount of semolina.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoubir Ferroukhi: "No Gasoline, No </F>
Newspapers?"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Service station operators and workers at the 
downtown printing press are threatening to go on strike. Do 
labor tensions really need ratcheting up another notch? 
  It is very possible our readers will not find their 
newspaper 
in the kiosks this Tuesday, and no one knows how long the strike 
at SIA [Algiers Printing Company], which prints LIBERTE and 
other dailies, will last. Beginning tonight at midnight, 
service-station franchise operators are also going to shut down 
for a week, and smart motorists will fill up their tanks before 
noon. First no gasoline, now no newspapers, unless something can 
be worked out today. In short, the labor situation is 
deteriorating, if not quite yet calamitous. 
  The issue at SIA is not really new. The bone of contention 
is 
implementation of a new wage schedule approved by the company's 
board of directors but apparently blocked by high-level 
intervention, probably by the Labor Ministry. SIA's management 
is trying to work things out, but the SIA union local is 
determined to follow through on its threat to strike, which it 
temporarily suspended on 16 February. The accord reached by 
labor and management was reviewed by the ministry on 17 January 
and seemed well on its way to implementation, since it took into 
account among other things the financial condition of the 
enterprise (which was good) and the sound measures enacted by 
SIA management. Unless the authorities concerned take dramatic 
action, the presses may quit rolling, as of tomorrow. 
  The other dispute, involving service-station franchise 
operators, actually erupted several months ago. It hinges 
basically on the low-profit margins forced on them by current 
fuel prices. The franchise operators, affiliates of the National 
Union of Merchants (UGCAA), are incensed not only at the refusal 
of the relevant authorities--in this instance, NAFTAL [National 
Enterprise for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products]--to 
seriously discuss the issue, but also concerned about a much 
more fundamental problem. The operators have long demanded the 
right to run their businesses freely to maximize profit, 
something NAFTAL does not want to hear. 
  An employers' organization, the CNPA [National Confederation 
of Algerian Patronat], has just thrown its support to the 
strike, which could seriously inflame labor tensions already 
aggravated by the unprecedented high cost of living. 
  Labor tension can also be found in other sectors. Our 
colleagues in the Photographic Agency (API), who have not been 
paid in months, yesterday went on an indefinite hunger strike, 
imploring the tutelary ministry to pay some attention to their 
plight and that of their families. Finally, talks have broken 
down between labor and management at the state-owned Major 
Petroleum Projects Enterprise (GTP). A meeting scheduled for 
today is expected to determine whether the strike will be 
postponed, or possibly canceled if the essential demands of 
workers in this important oil company are met. 
  The basic thread that runs through all these conflicts is 
always the same--to wit, that people are no longer as easily 
bought off with "promises" as they were in the bygone era of the 
one-party state. Even more important, the terms "dialogue" and 
"concertation" have become so debased that they now sound hollow 
and no longer seem to mean anything to the decisionmakers. It is 
a pity! 
<H5>  Franchise Operators </H5>
  Tomorrow's service-station strike, announced Saturday by the 
General Union of Algerian Merchants and Artisans (UGCAA), will 
not be observed by service-station franchise operators, Mr. Omar 
Gaya, president of the Association of Service Station Franchise 
Operators, told APS. 
  "In principle, we are not against the strike," said Mr. 
Gaya, 
noting however that, "this is hardly the time to launch such a 
strike" before adding that, "we have not been involved in this 
decision to stage a 7-day strike."

<F P=106> [Article by Badreddine Menaa: "Uncollected Taxes Amount to 5 </F>
Trillion Centimes"] 
  [Text] After attacking the industrial sector, the schools, 
various professional activities (newspaper sales, "hammams," and 
women's hairdressers), the terrorists are now assaulting the 
country's economic life in another way: by threatening tax 
collectors. 
  L'OPINION, citing official sources, claims that acts of 
intimidation are being perpetrated against tax authorities in 
the wilaya of Algiers, according to the official press agency 
APS. The intimidation campaign is being waged by means of 
threats against tax collectors, demanding that they quit 
collecting taxes beginning 17 February. 
  It goes without saying that the terrorists hope with these 
threats--which some are too frightened to withstand--to bring an 
already reeling state to its knees. Especially since, according 
to unconfirmed reports, some municipal tax authorities take the 
threats dead seriously. This is the case, for example, with a 
certain fiscal entity in uptown Algiers where several 
resignations reportedly have been submitted following receipt of 
such threats. 
  All this attests to the urgent need for the state to throw 
all its weight against the latest in this seemingly endless 
series of terrorist challenges. 
  In that regard, official sources quoted by APS have vowed 
that: "the destabilization efforts will not succeed in 
interfering with the operations of the tax authorities, and the 
authors of these threats will soon be identified and brought to 
justice." The same sources add that tax authorities, "with the 
steadfast support of their conscientious and devoted employees," 
intend to continue their "valiant struggle against tax fraud and 
evasion and their efforts to improve collections of imposts and 
taxes that belong to the nation." 
  Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that these threats have 
come just as the tax collectors were launching an ambitious 
campaign against tax fraud and evasion, which has cost the 
Treasury some 5 trillion (yes, five trillion!) centimes. 
  One can imagine the importance of such a sum at a time when 
the country is facing unprecedented financial needs. According 
to APS, the lost collections would be enough to build 75,000 
housing units. In other words, such a vast sum could provide 
shelter to more than 600,000 Algerians who lack any decent sort 
of housing. 
  Given all these facts, one cannot fail to ask why the 
terrorists (and their hidden backers) have chosen this 
particular time to attack the tax sector? The answer is obvious 
to many observers: In addition to undermining the authority of 
the state, the terrorists are trying to protect their own 
channels of funding. 
  In fact, the 5 trillion in lost revenue must be sought 
within 
the parasitic informal sector, the terrorists' principal 
domestic source of financing. The linkage between smugglers, 
speculators, and terrorists has been proved many times over in 
raids on various terrorist cells and in trials of individual 
terrorists. At the same time, by acting in this fashion the 
terrorists are trying to apply on a grand scale the racket they 
are already practicing in small localities on the south side of 
Algiers. Their other objective over the medium and longer term 
is to prevent implementation of serious economic reforms, since 
they realize a market economy cannot be built without a modern, 
proactive, and above all effective tax service. 
  In light of all these facts, it seems necessary to emphasize 
the importance and gravity of this new challenge. Shortly after 
now-deceased president Mohamed Boudiaf returned to Algeria, one 
of his confidants said the state's authority could be gauged by 
its ability to enforce the highway laws. Today, it must also 
defend its power to tax.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Faycal Metaoui: "Oran: </F>
Suburban Poverty Belts"] 
  [Text] At 2240 on Saturday, 25 December 1993, the Ras El 
Ain slum on the western side of Oran was totally silent. 
Suddenly the earth began to tremble. The inhabitants panicked. 
There was a landslide. The toll was 13 dead, 60 injured. A 
little over a month after the catastrophe, confusion still 
reigns.... 
  More than a hundred families are living in tents virtually 
in 
the shadow of the cave-in site. "Several years ago a wadi used 
to run through here," one young inhabitant told us. Those who 
lost their homes were the hardest hit by the January rains. 
Flood waters almost carried away the tents--and the occupants 
along with them. "Old people have fallen sick. Children are 
spitting up blood. People cannot sleep at night because of the 
cold," laments another youth, who says he had to quit his job to 
take care of his family. 
  Several meters from this place, which local authorities call 
a "transit camp," passes the road leading from Sidi El Houari to 
Planteurs, a populous quarter nestled at the base of Mt. 
Murdjadjo. Medical emergencies can occur at any moment. As a 
preventive measure, municipal health authorities have put an 
ambulance at the victims' disposal. 
  "We treat about 15 patients a day on-site. Recently we had a 
virtual epidemic of diarrhea," we were told by the doctor on 
duty. According to one camp resident, the malady was caused by 
nonpotable water from a tank truck. For four weeks now, the 
inhabitants have been waiting for a running water hook-up. 
  "The ambulance you see down there departs at 1700. Several 
times we urgently needed to evacuate sick people. Without a 
vehicle, it was very difficult to do. Even the taxi drivers 
refused to come into our quarter," says a man with graying hair. 
Another informs us that for lack of room, young people in some 
families have to find someplace on their own to sleep at nights. 
  A brief tour of the camp brought to light scenes worthy of a 
favelas. Cooking utensils, mattresses, and linens were strewn 
pell-mell beside each tent. The two footpaths that separate the 
tents (and are still unusable) are known to the inhabitants as 
"Sandala and Anana boulevards." People here try constantly to 
make light of the appallingly wretched conditions. But at one 
point, a women hidden behind a curtain asks our escorts the 
purpose of our visit. "Tell them to help us. We cannot go on 
like this any longer," she says in a choked voice. 
  In a desperate effort to shelter themselves from the winter 
rains, families have covered their temporary refuges with nylon 
provided by "a charitable soul." With a measure of pride, the 
father of a family shows off the abode he built on a small 
hillock out of stones and sheet metal. He could no longer stand 
to live with his many children under a tent. But for all of 
them, mere survival has been a struggle. 
  Some residents are already getting suspicious, especially 
since workers sent by the Oran executive delegation have started 
digging a trench in preparation for building a wall. 
  The families are concerned about their "temporary" housing. 
"If they have decided to build a wall, it is because they want 
to keep us here a long time," one adolescent protests. The waste 
water from toilets hastily built by the commune is carried away 
in an open drainage ditch. Household garbage is dumped 
haphazardly a few tenths of a mile from the camp. Nauseous odors 
attack the nose. 
  To the victims, the site (nicknamed "Hay Geyouni") is a 
constant reminder of the terrifying landslide. 
  They all want to get away from it. The ruins of houses 
destroyed by the cave-in are still visible. Thirtyish Houari 
Yahia sighs painfully whenever he looks at them. When the 
catastrophe struck, the young man lost both his father and his 
mother. 
<H5>  Frightening Memory </H5>
  It is no use telling him the habitations that collapsed were 
built above a tunnel used for growing mushrooms. He does not 
want to know. His only concern is to find decent housing for his 
two sisters (one of whom is mentally ill) and his young brother. 
He was chosen by the other victims to head a committee that is 
working to plead their cause with the local authorities. 
  "We were received by all the officials, including the DEC 
[expansion not given] and the head of the daira. Lots of 
promises..." we were told. In mid-January the DEC announced that 
plots of land in the Quatre Chemins quarter would be distributed 
to Ras El Ain victims so they could build their own new homes. 
But as soon as heads of families got to the site, they ran into 
immense problems with a state-owned enterprise that claimed 
ownership of the land. 
  Still, financial aid totaling 40,000 Algerian dinars was 
promised. "What is the Red Cross doing? None of its officials 
deigned to pay us a visit. What happens to all the donations 
they get?" asks one committee member. 
  The DEC has acknowledged the existence of about fifty abodes 
in the Sidi El Houari quarter still facing the threat of 
collapse. According to official statistics, 326 sites providing 
shelter for 3,400 families in Oran's old town could fall in at 
any moment. 
  Ras El Ain, perched on a hillside, is one of those forgotten 
housing projects--along with Planteurs, Sidi El Houari, and Bel 
Horizon--that surround the city of El Bahia. Planteurs is a 
quarter that extends for 3 km along the flank of Murdjadjo. 
  It is separated from the rest of Oran by the Ras El Ain 
ravine. The latter is boxed in between the steep, rocky edge of 
the Oran plateau and the sloping mountainside of Murdjadjo. 
Longtime Oran residents recall that El Bahia's first inhabitants 
were attracted there by the abundance of water and fertile soil. 
Some inhabitants continue willy-nilly to cultivate a few plots 
along the banks of a wadi, although the stream bed has become a 
veritable refuse dump. 
  Emerging from Freres Benkhedda square on the lower side of 
Sidi El Houari, the Ras El Ain development presents an appalling 
spectacle. Whole blocks of houses are crammed together in 
chaotic disorder. What we think of as streets do not really 
exist here--just small walkways of packed earth. 
<H5>  No Disinfectant </H5>
  A topographical study several years ago revealed serious 
surface instability at several locations, which puts houses with 
stone foundations at permanent risk of collapse. As early as 
1977, plans were made to rid Ras El Ain ravine of the "unhealthy 
and precarious" structures "already standing." "Relocation of 
Ras El Ain's inhabitants to undeveloped zones is an urgent 
priority," one reads in this study. But nothing was ever done. 
Built of sun-dried bricks or a mixture of rock and clay, the 
habitations constitute a constant source of danger. Other abodes 
built of sheet metal or wood are on the verge of collapse. Local 
authorities had plans under the auspices of various development 
schemes to raze some 1,400 (potentially hazardous) structures 
housing more than 2,400 families. 
  For reasons unknown, this operation was never carried out. 
Planteurs, as part of the slum eradication campaign, got special 
treatment. Not only has the quarter become a gigantic cesspool, 
but the unkept promises of officials are doing more damage than 
one could imagine. 
  "People here are living in a sham development. The 
inhabitants are crushed beneath the weight of all sorts of 
problems, but no one tries to understand the causes of their 
suffering," fumes a nurse at a huge medical center originally 
designed to specialize in pediatrics and gynecology. According 
to our interlocutor, the place is now almost totally abandoned. 
She says, for example, that occupancy never exceeds 30 percent. 
Entire floors are empty. Patients, seeing the lack of funds, 
medicine, and equipment, have opted for other hospital centers. 
"How can we care for patients when we do not even have so much 
as a jar of disinfectant?" she asks. The facility is in a poor 
location...it stands opposite an unauthorized public dump. 
  The number of inhabitants has grown tenfold in the last 13 
years. Moreover, at least according to a goodly number of 
sociologists, the populations of Ras El Ain, Planteurs, and Sidi 
El Houari are suffering from marginalization: "In the view of 
many, Ras El Ain's inhabitants simply do not exist. We are 
treated almost as if we were outlaws. Taxi drivers refuse to 
pick us up at night. As they see it, the people here are vulgar 
`beznassa' if not actually thieves," we were told by one 
anguished young victim. An urban planner has observed, in 
another academic study, that local authorities have long refused 
to treat Ras El Ain and Planteurs "as an integral part of the 
city of Oran. In addition, the authorities have always rejected 
the idea that these quarters have any legal existence." And 
that, in a word, is the whole tragedy of Ras El Ain....

<F P=106> [Article by Amir Tahiri: "Three Years After Desert Storm: A </F>
Stick-Only Policy Not Likely To Be Any More Effective Than a 
Carrot-Only Policy"] 
  [Text] It has been three years since the end of the war to 
liberate Kuwait, and still people in Iraq and in the region are 
yet to find the peaceful atmosphere that many anticipated as the 
inevitable consequence of that war. 
  There is no doubt that Iraq carries the major burden of 
suffering. Kuwait, though still trying to recover from the 
impact of an exceptionally brutal occupation, has succeeded in 
healing a lot of its wounds. It has also corrected many of its 
past mistakes, if not all of them. It has also abandoned its 
past comedic radicalism, learned the value of humility, and 
reformulated its policies to reflect the realities of its 
existence. 
  As for the neighboring Arab states, they have learned many a 
lesson of the shock generated by the invasion and the consequent 
liberation of Kuwait. Experience has moderated their usually 
seraphic view of international life. 
  They have come to realize that they live among neighbors 
that 
are particularly dangerous and that security cannot be achieved 
solely through appeasement and check diplomacy. 
  Iran, on the other hand, has failed to exploit the 
opportunity afforded by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to regain 
its appropriate place in the [community of] nations. Iranian 
strategy remains a function of fiery slogans that exclude any 
rational analysis of the situation. 
  The principal loser, as we already mentioned, has been Iraq. 
It continues to live under harsh restrictions imposed on its 
national sovereignty. Part of its land has been taken away, 
ostensibly to create a "secure haven" for the Kurds. Iraqi air 
space is largely off limits to Iraqi flights and the Iraqi 
Government is unable to access its frozen assets abroad. 
  More importantly, Iraq is unable to engage in common 
commerce, including the exportation of its oil and the 
importation of goods other than medical and food supplies. 
  Is it not time, then, to scrutinize the events in Iraq and 
its environs and then inquire if current policies should be 
maintained without modification? 
  There are endless stories of the misery, deprivation, and 
despair that beset the people of Iraq as a result of 
international sanctions. We cannot shrug off those accounts as 
the manufacture of Saddam's infernal propaganda apparatus, 
because they originate with such trusted institutions as UNICEF 
and Physicians Without Borders, as well as with independent 
relief organizations. One must therefore take these accounts 
seriously. 
  And that brings us to the question of sanctions, since we 
should never forget why they were imposed in the first place or 
which of them should remain in place and for how long. 
  Some people, including the Kuwaitis who suffered, want the 
sanctions to continue until Saddam Husayn is toppled. Such a 
position, though understandable, has no justification, because 
Saddam's overthrow cannot be a fitting United Nations political 
objective, at least not according to the resolutions adopted so 
far by the international Security Council. 
  That is a matter for the Iraqi people; and even then it 
would 
be difficult for us to fathom how a starving people that are 
forced to spend most of their time trying to survive would have 
the power to topple such a particularly abominable regime. 
  Worse yet, the sanctions have prevented the fractured 
opposition from working to solidify its ranks, embark on a 
viable strategy, and offer a real alternative. The opposition 
has pinned its hopes on the mistaken belief that sanctions would 
destroy Saddam, therefore allowing his opponents to ride a red 
carpet into Baghdad. 
  A second reason cited for maintaining the sanctions is to 
compel Iraq to abide by cease-fire stipulations and [to respect] 
Security Council resolutions. 
  That is a sound and justifiable view. Still, one cannot 
dismiss [the idea of establishing] some sort of correlation 
between the scope and intensity of the sanctions on one hand, 
and the degree of Iraqi compliance on the other. In other words, 
if there is Iraqi compliance with 50 percent of the conditions, 
should not the sanctions be proportionately reduced? 
  There is no doubt that Baghdad has done all it can to evade 
compliance. It is also obvious that Iraq is far from fulfilling 
all of its commitments. 
  The nuclear aspect has been dealt with, but Iraq continues 
to 
conceal a major portion of its chemical and germ arsenal. It 
also continues to be evasive, not only on the issue of borders 
with Kuwait, but also on relinquishing all claims against its 
neighbor. 
  That may be reason to keep some of the sanctions, at least 
until Iraq fulfills all of its obligations, but the stick-alone 
policy is not likely to be fruitful, and neither is the 
carrot-alone policy. 
  One should put one's self in the shoes of the Iraqis. They 
have no incentive to honor their commitments because it is their 
belief that they will continue to suffer the full [burden of] 
sanctions whether or not they comply with UN resolutions. In a 
region where international policy is considered to be nothing 
more than a series of conspiracies, it is not inconceivable for 
the Iraqis to believe that they are victims of an international 
conspiracy. 
  The time has come to review Iraqi performance over the past 
three years, in its entirety, in order to determine whether or 
not changes in current policies toward Iraq are warranted.

<F P=106> [Article by Gay Bekhor, HA'ARETZ Arab Affairs Correspondent </F>
  [Text] "If the future Palestinian self-rule will err by 
inefficiency, corruption, and tyranny, it will meet in a short 
time the fate of the secular regime in Algeria, which received 
broad credit at the beginning, and now holds onto power with all 
its strength versus a violent and popular radical Islamic 
opposition. That is one of the most serious problems that await 
the Palestinians--and, therefore, us as well. As it appears from 
the outside, the leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is 
not ripe for the transition from leading an underground to 
leading a state or a self-rule"--warns MK [member of Knesset] 
Efrayim Sne, with regard to the day after the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. Sne, who holds the title of doctor of 
internal medicine, was the chief of civil administration in 
Judaea and Samaria and the commander of the security region in 
Lebanon. 
  [HA'ARETZ]A key question in the conduct of the 
negotiations for the Cairo agreement was the strengthening of 
'Arafat and the members of his circle. Too good an agreement 
from our viewpoint was liable to weaken 'Arafat, and in that 
situation it would not be honored by the Palestinian 
population. 
  [Sne] We are interested that the side that reached the 
agreement with us will be able to return to the Palestinian 
public, which it represents, and to show it achievements--as 
long as these do not impair sovereignty. We were flexible on 
those symbols that do not have security implications. 
  [HA'ARETZ]Can 'Arafat flourish any achievements at all 
following the Cairo agreement? 
  [Sne] The achievement is that they are partners in the 
management of the crossing points, without receiving 
responsibility on the subject of security. If they would hurry 
up and prepare administrative institutions, they would have 
first received the money from the international community, and 
would display achievements in economics and infrastructure. To 
my sorrow, they are not doing that. We cannot compensate them 
generously on the security issue for what they cannot ensure for 
themselves in the financial and material spheres. 
  [HA'ARETZ]Can the Cairo agreement as it stands, without 
the freeing of prisoners, without the returning of expellees, 
and without the transfer of civil authority, be accepted by the 
Palestinian public in the territories? 
  [Sne] When the agreement is translated in the field, the 
Palestinian public will be able to see with its own eyes what is 
most important to it: a certain withdrawal, that will herald 
larger withdrawals in the future by the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces]. But according to the surveys that are appearing, even 
today the support for the Palestinian opposition is not high. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] won about 15-percent 
support, and the left fronts are winning a few percent, so that 
the picture is not so bleak. 
  [HA'ARETZ]What is your opinion of the two approaches 
that prevail among us--one, that the PLO will serve us as a 
shield against fundamentalist Islam, and the other, which is 
based on fears of cooperation against us between Hamas and the 
PLO? 
  [Sne] There are among us persons who, out of lack of 
knowledge of the Palestinian reality, err with illusions. There 
are those who get caught up in fear and those who get caught up 
in false optimism. There are those who fear that the PLO will 
try to outfox us by secret cooperation with Hamas, and that 
while it is the contractor of peace, Hamas will be the 
contractor of terror. Those who believe this do not understand 
that the antagonism between the secular PLO and the religious 
Hamas is sharp and cannot be resolved, because it stems from a 
diametrically opposed conception of the nature of the future 
Palestinian society. There is no compromise here, and the 
Palestinians must make decisions tomorrow morning. For example, 
how much religious studies will be in the schools and how much 
secular studies, what will be the religious content in the 
Palestinian schools, what will be the dress of the female 
employees of the Palestinian administration, will a female clerk 
in the driving license office in Bethlehem come to work in 
jeans. The battle will be fought over such things. 
  On the other hand, there are those who see in their mind's 
eye how the Palestinian police keep apart for them the Ez a-Din 
al-Kassem gangs and the settlements of the Katif Bloc. That is 
without any foundation. In the entire Palestinian family, there 
are three sons, the Fatah, the Popular Front, and another one 
that is the Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. They will be ready to 
fight each other over the control of the Palestinian street, but 
not in order to protect Avi Farhan or Tzvika Hendel. 
  [HA'ARETZ]Will a war of all against all break out in 
the territories after the withdrawal of the IDF? 
  [Sne] The fear of 1936-39 is still in them, the fear of 
civil 
war is rooted among them, and, of course, this depends on the 
question whether a vacuum will be created between the rule of 
the IDF and Palestinian rule. But, in my opinion, the key 
question is rooted in the quality of the self-rule that the 
Palestinians will establish. If it will have the correct balance 
of authority and efficiency without despotism and corruption--it 
will be able to impose its authority. If the balance is 
disturbed, it will be difficult for that rule to exist, and the 
proof of that is given in Algeria. 
  A corrupt Palestinian rule will encourage, more than 
anything 
else, the rise of Hamas, and even today part of the support for 
Hamas stems from lack of trust in the manner in which the PLO 
establishment is running things. Here the question is: how will 
the senior Palestinian administration be appointed. They have 
both in the territories and in the diaspora enough excellent 
individuals to staff these positions. The question is whether 
they will choose the good persons, or perhaps other 
considerations will guide them. Today they have a big advantage 
compared with Third World states: they can build their 
administrative government system from the bottom up and on a 
healthy basis. But if the beginning is bad, this system will 
crumble very quickly. The countries that are donating $2.2 
billion to the Palestinians will require only the slightest 
excuse in order to cancel their donations. If they do not see 
that an efficient apparatus is receiving the money, spending it 
efficiently, and supervising it, they will renege." 
  Sne says that he bases his statements on conversations that 
he had recently with those responsible for this in the European 
Community, and, according to him, they are aware of the problem. 
  [HA'ARETZ]The question is not only for the 
Palestinians, it is also ours, because we will be tied together 
after the signing of the agreement. 
  [Sne] We cannot impose either efficiency or democracy. At 
the 
same time, they have lived alongside us for 27 years and learned 
from us the good and the bad. They, for example, watch our 
television in the evening, and see that because of a discount in 
a hotel some want to change the inspector-general of the police. 
  [HA'ARETZ]The leadership that will come from Tunis to 
lead the residents of the territories does not watch our 
television, and in the social mixture that will be created in 
the territories between the "inside" and the "outside," tension 
will arise precisely due to the different way of relating to 
what can be termed corruption. 
  [Sne] That is one of the most serious problems, if not the 
most serious one of all. As it appears from the outside, the 
leadership in Tunis, or at least part of it, is not ready for 
the transition from the leadership of an underground to the 
leadership of a state or an independent entity. They have 
different criteria and different norms. If they think that they 
can run the West Bank of Gaza as they ran western Beirut and 
southern Lebanon, there will be ungodly disturbances here. It 
will inspire a harsh response both regarding brutality and 
corruption. As the commander of the region of southern Lebanon 
in the early 1980's, I still remember the extent of the cruelty 
with which the PLO ran things there. But it may be that they 
will pull themselves together and make the correct decisions. 
  There is no doubt that the failure of self-rule will also be 
the failure of the agreement. In any event, we will take care 
that in any situation, the security key will remain in our hands. 
  [HA'ARETZ]In your opinion, is 'Arafat interested in 
holding elections and in a democratic system? 
  [Sne] They say not. 
  [HA'ARETZ]And is Israel? 
  [Sne] We are interested in a democratic Palestinian system, 
but we do not have the possibility of establishing fully the 
internal processes there. But to wish that there be totalitarian 
rule there that would ensure short-term stability and cause the 
population to revolt in the long run, that is a mistaken desire. 
It is the nature of despotic rule to become stagnant, and then 
the internal opposition that would be there would come out 
against them and against us. 
  [HA'ARETZ]However, is there not something real in the 
assertion that general elections will establish officially the 
demands of Hamas, if they win, for example, 30 percent? In that 
way, it will have a significant right of veto, and we ourselves 
will place the veto in their hands. 
  [Sne] If they will be 30 percent, it is preferable that they 
be 30-percent represented, rather than 30 percent fighting from 
the outside for their place. Look at the smart calculation of 
King Husayn in this matter. The real obstacle to Islamic 
fundamentalism is economic progress. An educated and satisfied 
society successfully curbs Islamic radicalism. Therefore, here 
our interest and that of the PLO leadership come together. An 
agreement that works would bring with it investments, foreign 
money, and economic development, and then radical Islam would 
retreat. If there will not be a successful agreement, it will 
not be accompanied by all those things, and fundamentalism will 
get stronger. That is bad for them and bad for us. Due to this 
intersection of interests, there is room for optimism."

  [Text] [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv BITA'ON HEYL HA'AVIR in 
Hebrew, February 1994, on pages 4, 8, 24, and 25 reports details 
on F-16 refueling capabilities, real-time satellite imaging, and 
a comparison of the F-22 with the Eurofighter and French Rafal. 
  On page 4, the journal reports that the F-16 will be 
equipped 
shortly with a new system that will enable it to be refueled 
in-air by Hercules aircraft. Other warplanes will also 
similarly be equipped. This will increase the in-air refueling 
capaability beyond that currently being offered by Boeing 
aircraft. 
  On page 8, the journal quotes Professor Valentin 
Proyalyiker, 
director of the new center for satellite information research at 
Bar-Ilan University, who says, "For the first time in Israel we 
will be able to receive real-time satellite imagery without 
depending on the approval of foreign elements." The official 
name of the center is "The Center for Remote Sensing." This is 
possible because of a unique cooperation agreement with the 
Institute for Radiophysics and Electronics at Krarkov in the 
Ukraine. The center receives broadcasts from the Ukrainian 
satellite Okean, which was launched last December. A microwave 
radar (3.2-cm wavelength) and television camera were mounted on 
the satellite. The radar resolution is not high (500 meters) 
and the camera sweep area is 500-2,000 km. The resolution of 
the next satellite radar (SICH), which will be launched in 1995, 
will be much higher with underground search capability. 
Information is easily accessible because Kharkov and Israel are 
on the same longitudinal line along which the satellite moves. 
  On pages 24 and 25, the journal reports that Israel will 
need 
a new fighter aircraft for the next decade to replace the F-15. 
The only existing fighter expected to remain in competition 
will be the F-18. Three planes are expected to lead the combat 
aircraft market at the start of the 21st century: the American 
F-22, the European Eurofighter, and the French Rafal. Due to 
technical and budgetary problems with the Eurofighter and the 
Rafal, the F-22 is expected, for now, to be the fighter plane of 
choice. It meshes well with the philosophy of the Israel Air 
Force with its maneuverability, low-radar signature, ability to 
carry lethal air-to-air missiles, and its air-to-ground smart 
weapons capability.

  [Text] Kuwait--A Kuwaiti economic expert, 'Adnan al-Bahr, 
expressed criticism of the conditions in Kuwait's financial 
market, and of those responsible for it, because of the absence 
of a clear strategy for emerging from the crisis the financial 
market is experiencing. 
  Al-Bahr, who is the chairman of the board of the [Kuwait] 
International Investment Corporation, said in an interview with 
AL-HAYAH that the Kuwaiti economy is experiencing a period of 
fundamental change, the results of which have yet to emerge. He 
said that other Gulf markets were compelled to enter this phase 
of change before Kuwait, in the eighties when oil prices dipped 
substantially, prompting the Gulf countries to reorder their 
economic priorities and restructure their paths. 
  He said that these economies have begun to grow, each in its 
own way, within the past five to eight years. The Saudi economy 
was able to flourish and grow strongly based on private-sector 
growth, the recovery of its securities and real estate market, 
and the renewed profitability of organizations in the Saudi 
market. 
  Al-Bahr described the Saudi economy as "strong with respect 
to professionalism, efficiency, and direction." He said that the 
UAE [United Arab Emirates] economy, especially in the emirate of 
Dubayy, takes after the Saudi economy. 
  He noted that Kuwait is the only country that has emerged 
from these circumstances without having to adapt, because its 
investment returns have covered the drop in its oil revenues. 
  He suggested that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait forced the 
Kuwaiti Government to spend half of its financial reserves, 
which has in turn compelled Kuwait to reorder its economic 
priorities and to reorganize. 
  He stressed that, if oil market conditions worsen, it will 
become even more necessary for Kuwait to adapt and to pursue the 
policies adopted by the other Gulf countries. 
  Al-Bahr described the Kuwaiti economy as "fat and 
overstuffed. Its problem is that it has taken a liking to 
excess. It needs a strict diet to shed its opulence and lethargy 
to become a slim, flexible economy." By doing so, he stressed, 
it will have adopted a sound method for adapting to the current 
circumstances. 
  He believes that oil should be used more efficiently to 
benefit the Kuwaiti economy, that alternatives should be sought, 
and that sole reliance upon a single source of income should be 
avoided. He said, "We in Kuwait have long clamored for improving 
the economy and finding alternatives to oil. However, in the 
short term, we can improve the economic situation by improving 
efficiency in the economy through less use and greater output. 
In other words, we should use oil income minimally to yield 
maximum results." 
  He believes that this "can happen easily, because we have a 
large economy, even though it suffers from waste and incorrect 
use, which is the result of many years of ease and affluence." 
  He said, "In coming years, Kuwait will undergo the painful 
cure we saw in the lean years of the economies of Saudi Arabia 
and the UAE, but we can bear this pain." 
  He said, "Change will bring new opportunities to the Kuwaiti 
market. At the same time, many traditional areas of activity 
will experience difficulty in adapting to change, because the 
process of restructuring positions will be trying. A contractor 
who used to serve the public sector will be forced to face stiff 
competition in the private sector." 
  Al-Bahr suggested that the coming phase will bring with it 
the expansion and promotion of the private sector through new 
projects and companies, the sale of shares, and the general 
public's ownership of the private sector. This means that there 
will be a larger supply of investment assets for the capital 
aggregate itself, and that new assets and investment 
opportunities will be added to the monetary aggregate. 
  He attributed the recent slight improvement in the Kuwaiti 
market to the drop in interest rates. He said, "It stimulated 
investment activities. In addition, with the settlement of a 
difficult debt problem--which involved the state's purchase of 
bad debts from businessmen after Kuwait was liberated from the 
Iraqi invasion--large corporations have begun to adapt to their 
new positions." 
  He said that medium-term investment prospects in Kuwait will 
remain stabile or decline. However, he expressed optimism about 
the economic situation in the long term--provided that the 
economy is successful in moving beyond the current phase--with 
respect to attracting greater levels of Gulf and international 
capital by creating flexible policies and advantageous 
systems--e.g., the tax system--and minimizing red tape in 
business transactions. 
  Al-Bahr said that the flight of domestic and Gulf capital is 
due to insufficient investment opportunities, not to political 
factors that provoke fear. He said that enough funds exist to 
cover good investment activities. 
  He emphasized the importance of extricating the Kuwaiti 
market from its crisis of red tape and paralyzed decisionmaking, 
which pose a major risk to the initiation of any project. 
  On another subject, al-Bahr said that the Islamic capital 
market is considered a growing market and that half of the 
capital in the Gulf market will flow to Islamic financial 
organizations within the next five to 10 years. He attributed 
this to the specialized nature of this market, which frees it 
from competition with international organizations. 
  He said that Islamic organizations will be among the most 
successful international organizations in the coming years. He 
estimated that between $30 billion and $40 billion are invested 
in these organizations. He expects that this figure will reach 
$100 billion within the next decade.

<F P=106> [Article by Dirgham Masrujah: "Morocco Prepares for GATT </F>
Agreement After 10 Years of Adaptation"] 
  [Text] Casablanca--How will Morocco be affected by the GATT 
agreement that the nations of the world will sign here this 
April? This question is the keynote of a debate that has been 
going on in Moroccan economic circles since the successful 
conclusion of GATT's current Uruguay Round resulted in the 
agreement that will be officially signed in Marrakech, 
inaugurating an unprecedented new stage of international trade 
relations. 
  Amid the ongoing debate, many warnings have emerged about 
negative effects on Morocco's exports and economy from 
implementation of the agreement, which aims at reducing trade 
barriers; but the official Moroccan agency responsible for 
applying the terms of the agreement holds a different view: that 
the Moroccan economy is ready for GATT. 
  Morocco joined the GATT agreement on 17 June 1987, several 
years after it began to implement an economic liberalization 
policy in 1983 and apply a structural reform program in 
coordination with the World Bank and the IMF. 
  The program involved gradual reduction of customs duties, 
which are no longer high, as they were before 1983. Another 
effect has been to cancel Schedule C, one of the schedules that 
listed imported goods deemed to compete with Moroccan-produced 
goods. Until Schedule C was cancelled in 1983 and Schedule A 
expanded to represent 78 percent of imported materials, 
authorities used to require that an import license be obtained. 
They now demand an import license only for 13 percent of 
imports, it being understood that the license will ultimately be 
repealed, so that the Moroccan market will become open to free 
importation. 
  This change has been accompanied by a gradual reduction in 
customs fees. In 1987, these fees were of three kinds: customs 
duties, a special fee on importation, and customs revenue stamps. 
  In January 1988, the 5-percent special fee and the 
10-percent 
revenue stamp were combined and replaced with a single fee of 
12.5 percent, with a few exceptions stipulated in the latest 
budget (1994). The law imposed rates of 12.5 percent on 
pharmaceutical goods, 10 percent on goods for finishing, and 15 
percent on other goods. 
  The latest budget has set customs duties at 35 percent, 
except for some agricultural products to which rates from 40 to 
45 percent apply. Government circles consider the reduction to 
this level--rates were as high as 400 percent before the reform 
program was implemented--a major sign of the economic 
liberalization policy and of Morocco's gradual preparation to 
enter the stage of implementing the GATT agreement. 
  To demonstrate that the current changes are no sudden event 
for Morocco, these circles note that 90 percent of Morocco's 
foreign trade takes place with member nations of the GATT. They 
say that, despite allegations in the economic press that GATT 
will not safeguard Morocco's economic fabric and that it will 
impact Moroccan exports negatively and flood the local market 
with imports, the Moroccan authorities have gone through 10 
years of reform and economic adaptation. The economy has been 
liberalized on the ground that it has achieved a certain level 
of development, performance, and competition. When the time came 
to approve GATT, Morocco was not required to come down from 400 
percent customs protection to 45 percent; the requirements will 
be much less. Industry thus will be able to compete. 
  Since the announcement of a successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round and of a date for the signing of the agreement in 
Marrakech, business, media, and semiofficial circles have been 
debating the extent to which Morocco will benefit from 
implementing the GATT agreement and the extent to which its 
terms will affect the local economy. 
  The positions that have emerged in this debate have proved 
to 
be personal impressions not based on a practical foundation or 
on familiarity with the terms of the agreement or the extent of 
the Moroccan economy's compliance with these terms. These 
positions have made it clear that their authors have not been 
keeping up with the gradual process of customs reductions and 
with economic policy goals. 
  In the face of this situation, the agency addressed 
regarding 
GATT has come to be the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign 
Investments, whereas once there were many addressed. This 
ministry has come to be entrusted with the GATT portfolio and 
responsibility for giving answers about it to the media and 
other bodies. 
  Here is its view of the issue that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT raised. 
It is followed by the view expressed at a Casablanca meeting on 
10 February by exporters' and agriculturalists' associations. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked Driss Taraki, director of the 
ministry's Rabat bureau, what effect implementing the GATT 
agreement would have on Morocco's domestic economy. 
  Driss Taraki said that over 90 percent of Morocco's foreign 
trade is with GATT members. He added that because Morocco has 
joined the agreement, its foreign trade and customs tariff would 
become subject to the multilateral agreement's principles and 
requirements, especially respect for the most favored nation 
principle, national treatment, and not resorting to nontariff 
measures to protect national production, such protection being 
effected basically through customs duties. 
  Regarding possible stages of a phased application of the 
agreement, what sectors would be affected in the first phase, 
and an assessment of these effects, Driss Taraki said that the 
answer involved one of the most important focuses of the 
multilateral trade negotiations that took place in the Uruguay 
Round--market entry. Three sectors were included: industrial 
goods, agricultural goods, and textiles. 
<H5>  Preferential Treatment </H5>
  Tarraki said that the principle of phased application 
applies 
basically to the agricultural and textile sectors. 
  He explained that with regard to the farming sector, the 
Uruguay Round's second convention stipulated a 36-percent 
reduction of total customs tariffs implemented over six years. 
However, at the level of domestic support for this sector, the 
scheduled reduction would be 20 percent, spread over six years. 
  Subsidies earmarked for supporting exports would be reduced 
by 36 percent, and the quantities supported would be reduced by 
21 percent, also over a period of six years. 
  Tarraki stated that Morocco, as a developing country, would 
receive three sorts of preferential treatment: 
  First, it would be possible to maintain high tariffs on 
imports. 
  Second, the pledged reduction could be implemented over a 
period of 10 years, instead of the six years for industrialized 
countries. The reduction would be one-third lower than the 
obligations of an industrialized country. 
  Third, Morocco did not pledge to lower support to the 
agricultural sector, as this support involved less than 10 
percent of agricultural production. 
<H5>  Agricultural Products Advantage </H5>
  Taraki explained Morocco's competitive strength in the area 
of agricultural exports on the basis of high production costs 
among Morocco's competitors. This high level is due to the 
lowering of support and subsidies to agriculture and farmers by 
two-thirds more than Morocco's. This difference between Morocco 
and the industrialized countries means that additional 
protection is afforded the Moroccan agricultural sector, 
increasing the competitive strength of its agricultural exports. 
  As for the textile trade, it will be incorporated into the 
agreement in a three-stage process over a period of 10 years. At 
each stage a certain percentage of textile imports will be set, 
with a gradual raising of the quotas that the industrialized 
countries apply. 
  Regarding industrial goods, Driss Taraki stated that Morocco 
has offered to stabilize customs duties on manufactured products 
at a level guaranteeing reasonable and sufficient protection for 
its national production. 
  In return, Morocco will benefit from customs reductions and 
the removal of noncustoms restrictions resulting from the 
Uruguay Round of negotiations. This will broaden and diversify 
the markets for Moroccan exports. 
  About policies and adaptation measures needed to enable the 
local economy to withstand the results of GATT and the resultant 
gradual liberalization of the local market, Taraki said: 
"Applying the results of GATT requires that one take adaptive 
measures to ensure good exploitation of available resources in 
this framework and to prepare the various sectors to face 
international competition." 
  He said that Morocco basically is focusing adaptative 
measures on strengthening the competitiveness of production. The 
government is carefully studying a large number of measures in 
this direction, particularly ones related to improving the 
environment of companies and exporters and mechanisms to 
stimulate exports, diversify competition, lower production 
costs, and simplify executive procedures. 
  On the question of whether the GATT rules will affect trends 
of foreign trade among the region's markets and stimulate these 
regional markets, Taraki said: "The question can be seen in the 
context of recent legal discussions about preferential 
agreements and GATT's position on such systems, which could be 
considered an exception to the most favored nation principle." 
  GATT, he said, does not invalidate such preferential 
agreements, provided that their provisions conform to those of 
GATT, despite some people's belief that GATT would rule out 
regional cooperation. 
  Such agreements, he explained, would have to implement the 
terms that GATT gradually introduces into every preferential 
agreement, so that they could continue to be applied in 
conformity with GATT rules. 
<H5>  Six Arab States </H5>
  He said that thus far only six Arab states have joined GATT: 
Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania, and Bahrain. Saudi 
Arabia and Jordan have recently applied to join the agreement. 
  This does not mean there are no bilateral trade agreements 
linking the Arab states among themselves--either bilateral 
agreements or agreements in which Arab states are party to an 
agreement to facilitate and develop trade exchanges concluded 
under the Arab League. 
  Taraki stated that this preferential context has acquired an 
incentive coloration allowing for branches of foreign banks and 
the principles of openness and publication of budgets and other 
things. Summarizing the Moroccan position, Taraki said that the 
final treaty of the Uruguay Round embraced the principle of 
openness and gradual liberalization of this sector. Morocco, he 
said, has instituted reforms of the banking sector. It has 
issued a new banking law aimed at flexibility and openness. The 
law protects depositors, imposes monitoring of reserves and 
assets, and mandates simplified procedures to license foreign 
banks to operate in Morocco. The principle of gradually 
liberalizing the Moroccan economy over a period of 10 years has 
put Morocco in step with the GATT rules. 
<H5>  Fears </H5>
  As part of the ongoing debate over the effect of 
implementing 
the agreement on the local economy, we shall summarize the 
demands and concerns voiced at a meeting held in Casablanca on 
10 February by a group of associations representing Moroccan 
exporters of agricultural products. 
  They expressed fears that a united Europe has designed a 
series of measures regulating its relations among its member 
nations on the one hand and with other nations on the other hand. 
  They said that Europe is now working to bring its laws into 
conformity with the requirements of liberalized international 
trade under the Uruguay agreement. They thought that these 
measures would affect Moroccan exports to Europe negatively. 
They said that about 220 firms would shut their doors and about 
5,000 workers be threatened with unemployment. 
  They stated that the GATT agreement, of which Morocco is a 
member, does not guarantee the preservation of Morocco's 
economic fabric. An effort has to be made to shape terms to 
strengthen this fabric, so that it can sustain the challenge and 
in turn develop the national economy. 
  The participants issued a communique, saying that they 
support government policy in the area of concluding a new 
agreement between Morocco and Europe in light of suggestions by 
the European Union in the context of the GATT agreement. 
  At the same time, they demanded that the authorities spare 
no 
effort to defend agricultural exports and protect the gains 
realized in this field in the traditional markets of the 
European Union. 
  They demanded that the coming bilateral agreement between 
Morocco and Europe protect the position of Moroccan products in 
their traditional European markets. The agreement should help 
improve conditions for the entry of Moroccan agricultural 
products, which have been suffering for some time from nontariff 
barriers that they believe are unjustified--such as the 
reference price and the compensatory duty. 
  From the official position expressed by Driss Taraki and the 
position of these associations, it does not appear that the 
Moroccan Government will agree to GATT's not guaranteeing 
Morocco the preservation of its economic fabric. The government 
does not see GATT, as some see it, as a storm that will conquer 
everything in its path. Instead, it sees GATT as an agreement 
whose terms will be implemented gradually over 10 years, instead 
of six years for the industrialized countries. It sees GATT as 
protecting its agricultural products when support is lifted from 
agricultural products and farmers in the industrialized 
countries by two-thirds more than in Morocco.

<F P=106> [Article by al-Mahdi Lahlou: "Unemployment and Wages Under </F>
Present Conditions"] 
  [Text] The manner in which the restructuring program has 
been carried out in Morocco has led to encouraging the exchange 
of goods at the expense of production and thus to the 
encouragement of an unregulated economy that pays low wages, 
refrains from carrying out social obligations, and avoids the 
payment of taxes. In the face of foreign competition, domestic 
private investment has increased [as published] without any 
compensating increase in foreign investment. All of this has 
fueled an unemployment crisis which has [also] been caused by 
the fact that the state has given up its role of providing 
employment. 
  Unemployment is considered to be the most important problem 
from which Morocco suffers. This problem rapidly became worse in 
the early eighties and has continued to become worse during the 
nineties. The underlying reason for the problem goes back to the 
manner in which the restructuring policy has been applied in 
Morocco since 1983. The policy had the aim of restoring 
equilibrium to both the nation's domestic and foreign finances. 
It was also behind the push to have the state give up numerous 
job slots considered to be normal and natural even in liberal 
economies and to give up protecting the national economy, both 
in the face of foreign competition and with regard to social 
gains for the working class. The rate of unemployment went up 
for three basic reasons. 
  The first reason was Morocco's open-door policy with regard 
to foreign countries. What this meant was that the doors were 
opened for foreign goods and services to be imported instead of 
having an increase in Morocco's exports, because our potential 
to produce and export goods had not risen to a level that could 
allow us to deal with foreign competition either on the 
technical or technological level or in terms of the nature and 
cost of our production. This liberal trade policy caused many 
Moroccan firms to go out of business, lay off many of their 
workers, or shorten their work hours. As a result, the rate of 
layoffs and level of unemployment both increased. The Moroccan 
companies were no longer able to employ as large a work force as 
they had, much less create new positions. Opening the doors of 
the economy in this fashion caused the economy to be oriented 
more toward the exchange of goods rather than the production of 
goods. This created what could be called a "bazaar economy," 
meaning an economy of buying and selling goods, without any 
production taking place, and an economy oriented toward the 
consumption of foreign goods without any domestic production or 
involving only domestic production that was very weak in terms 
of both quantity and quality. 
  So the liberalization of imports, without protection for the 
economic foundation of our domestic manufacturing and 
agricultural production, caused the rate of layoffs and 
unemployment in the production sectors to increase. 
  The second reason for the unemployment, due to the policy of 
restructuring and related to the first reason above, is that our 
economy was impelled to become what has been known for years as 
an unregulated or unstructured economy. This type of economy was 
encouraged because our economy embarked upon a policy of 
restructuring and because it will be part of the GATT agreements 
that will be signed in Marrakech in mid-April. As a result of 
this, our economy has entered into a framework of intense 
international competition on all levels, including the areas of 
cost of production, manner of production, and production 
efficiency. These factors have impelled numerous firms to leave 
the regulated sector and enter the unregulated sector. The 
reason for this is that, in the unregulated sector one can pay 
wages that are so low that they do not even come up to the level 
of the minimum wage, which is "theoretically" guaranteed by the 
state. Also, in this sector, one can avoid paying taxes, and the 
workers are given no social benefits, which they are supposed to 
receive. No contributions are paid to the national social 
security fund. Of course, this situation also applies even to 
some of the establishments operating within the structured 
economy. Another characteristic of the unstructured sector is 
that it does not provide for guaranteeing continued employment, 
because foreign competition leads to an increase in the rate of 
layoffs, and the rate of hiring new workers is subjected to 
external factors. This rate, in any case, remains circumstantial 
rather than being structural, because the establishments both 
lay off and hire workers whenever they so desire. Usually there 
are more layoffs than there are jobs created. 
  The Moroccan economy has become oriented toward being an 
unregulated economy that employs an uneducated work force. This 
explains why the figures published by the Directorate of 
Statistics show that the level of unemployment for holders of 
diplomas is higher than that for persons having no 
qualifications. Another characteristic of this sector is that it 
pays very low wages and is usually oriented toward employing 
women or children. This is something that has begun to become 
alarmingly widespread in nearly all the developing nations, 
especially those in Africa. Also, it is a trend that has begun 
to lead to the spread of numerous demographic phenomena, which 
are evident, for example, in the fact that the populations have 
stopped progressing and are going back to previous demographic 
growth levels. The number of children is increasing, whereas the 
average life expectancy is decreasing, because children who work 
during their early years usually are exposed to illnesses, 
accidents, and numerous ailments, shortening their life spans. 
This is something that causes social and demographical problems, 
and consequently economic problems. 
  The third reason for the increase in the unemployment rate 
is 
the decrease in the rate of domestic investment, without any 
compensating foreign investment. Whoever says that foreign 
investments have increased is mistaken, because when we compare 
foreign investments made between the years 1982 and 1992, we 
notice that the increase has not taken place to the degree 
quoted by official speeches. In fact, the increase during this 
period of time has not gone over 4 percent. This fact becomes 
even clearer if we take into consideration a series of factors 
such as the decrease in the value of the dirham, domestic 
inflation, and foreign inflation. This has led to an increase in 
the prices of numerous goods and equipment that we used to 
purchase before the beginning of the eighties. The same 1982 
investment, in terms of value, has become of far less value in 
real terms in 1992. 
  The fourth reason or factor is the appearance of what has 
come to be called the unemployment of young people who have 
graduated from educational institutions and have degrees. This 
new phenomenon is a result of the fact that the state has given 
up its role of providing them with employment. Until 1982 the 
organs of public administration provided from 40,000 to 50,000 
jobs each year. But then the restructuring policy began to be 
applied, and since this policy stipulates, among other things, 
that the state be downsized and the budget deficit be reduced by 
means of reducing public expenditures, the state has decreased 
its volume of employment, starting in 1983, down to between 
12,000 and 15,000 jobs per year. 
  Judging from the overall situation that characterized the 
above-mentioned 10-year period, it is clear that there was a 
difference of between 200,000 and 250,000 jobs provided in the 
seventies as opposed to the eighties. This clearly explains the 
reasons for the widespead unemployment among the ranks of our 
young people. These young people cannot get jobs unless the 
state undertakes its role of providing employment, particularly 
in fields that are experiencing a large gap [in the number of 
positions filled]--such as the field of education on all levels 
and the field of public health, which is considered to be one of 
the most impoverished fields both on the regional and 
international levels. 
  The employment of young people with degrees brings up the 
issue of the restructuring of our system of education and of 
programming its subjects in order to make the education more 
capable of providing young people with new opportunities to 
obtain jobs. This issue has become all the more relevant because 
the government has given up providing young people with 
employment, on the one hand, and because, in addition to this, 
the world economy has begun to demand that employees have skills 
and qualifications that are no longer provided by our system of 
education. 
  The four above-mentioned factors are what have led to a 
widespread high rate of unemployment in Morocco. The manner used 
in the attempt to mitigate the severity of unemployment in 
general and unemployment among our young people in particular 
has proved to be of limited effect, because employing young 
people either directly or indirectly in establishments created 
especially for this purpose has not led to the results hoped 
for. Since 1991, not more than 45,000 young persons have 
received jobs, whereas the goal was to create 100,000 jobs for 
young persons holding degrees in 1991. And since 1991 the size 
of this group of unemployed persons has grown because additional 
graduates from institutes and colleges since 1991 have increased 
the ranks of the unemployed. 
  In general, whether the matter concerns Morocco or other 
countries, the policy of restructuring has led to a decrease in 
employment because the policy was based on reducing the cost of 
labor and has caused the state to decrease its investments after 
the national economies of these nations were liberalized. Since 
the European economies are still dominant, since their export 
capabilities are greater than those of the backward nations, and 
since their production costs are lower in comparison to those of 
the backward countries, this has led to an increase in 
unemployment. In addition to this, Morocco occupies a special 
place within this general orientation. Morocco has experienced a 
noticeable decrease in its national income--down 3 percent in 
1992 when compared with 1991. Furthermore, this income is 
characterized by the fact that there is a great discrepancy in 
how it is distributed among the various groups of people in our 
country. There is a vast difference between the income of the 
low-income groups and the high-income groups. Proof of this can 
be seen in the realm of public employment where the highest 
official wage is as much as 70 times greater than the lowest 
official wage. This discrepancy in income, in addition to the 
meagerness of the average income, has caused the domestic market 
to continue shrinking. And this has caused both Moroccan and 
foreign investors to cease investing in this market. The absence 
of a domestic market is also a factor that can be added to the 
above-mentioned factors, which indicate that the rate of 
unemployment in Morocco will increase in coming years. Poor 
incomes do not help create a broad consumers' market. The 
absence of such a market means that there is no incentive for 
investment, and a lack of investment results in the lack of 
creation of jobs which, in turn, results in the spread of 
unemployment, impoverishment, and thus entry into a vicious 
circle. 
  As for fiscal rectification, which was one of the hoped-for 
goals of the policy of restructuring, results in this regard 
have been unsatisfactory. Let us disregard the fact that there 
has been a decrease in the rate of public expenditures, leading 
to a decrease in the number of government jobs and to a decrease 
in the public debt from 11 percent of the national income in 
1982 down to less than 2 percent at the present time. Let us 
disregard all of this--and it is something which the state has 
always been able to do in view of the fact that it has began to 
rapidly reduce its expenditures on employment, health, 
education, and the protection of consumer capacity of the 
low-income working classes by means of cutting the revenues of 
the budget fund. Disregarding all of this, it is nevertheless 
true that our foreign debt has not decreased from what it was in 
1982. That year the foreign debt was an estimated $13 billion, 
and in 1992 the value of the debt went up to where it amounted 
to about $22 billion. All of our financial and social efforts 
have not led to a decrease in the foreign debt. In fact, the 
opposite is true. The debt has increased in scope, because the 
actual policies that have resulted in this debt have not changed 
and are continuing as before. 
  Concerning the balance of trade, the policy of restructuring 
and the reduction [in value] of our national currency in the 
form that this has been done since 1982/83 have not led to a 
decrease in the trade deficit. Statistics coming out of the 
Office of the Budget themselves confirm this view, because 
exports amounted to only about 53 percent of imports in 1982, 
and the situation was still the same in 1992. The level of 
imports has been much higher than the level of exports. What 
this means is that Morocco has come to [export] more actual 
natural resources than it exported in 1982, because the value of 
our exports has either decreased or not increased sufficiently 
to keep pace with world inflation, whereas the prices of the 
goods we import from other nations have increased greatly. The 
reason for this is that the nations and companies who export 
these goods have control when it comes to setting the prices, 
and the consequence has been that Morocco is now exporting more 
goods at lower prices and is importing fewer goods at greater 
cost than we were importing in 1982. One should add to this the 
fact that the imbalance in the national income, the tax policy 
that has been followed since 1983, especially the policy 
followed with regard to customs duties and the value-added tax, 
has resulted in the fact that many of the luxury items that are 
imported are sold at prices that, in some cases, are nearly the 
same as the prices of basic items. This is something that 
becomes obvious when we see the imported luxury cars that are 
cruising around on our streets and roads. Also, we are importing 
a series of luxury appliances that the national economy could do 
without if we had a wise economic policy for controlling imports 
and protecting our national potential. 
  Even in the field of tourism we have seen that the 
devaluation of the dirham really has not changed anything. 
Income from tourism has been steadily declining since the 
mid-eighties, and foreign investments themselves have not 
increased as much as was anticipated by the economic production 
policy.
