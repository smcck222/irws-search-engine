  [Text] The need for the general public to cooperate with 
and assist law enforcement agencies in checking drug abuse, 
peddling, and exportation, has again been raised by the law 
enforcement agencies. The concern was expressed by Mr. Robert 
Ayalingo and Mr. F.K. Amuzu of CEPS [Customs, Excise and 
Preventive Service] at a seminar organized by the International 
Council on Alcohol and Addictions on drug smuggling by 
Ghanaians. George Lawson's report is read to you. [read by 
announcer] 
  There is increasing anxiety by the international community 
over the drug menace which is causing human destruction, 
threatening the security and future of many nations. Mr. Robert 
Ayalingo pointed out that the greater percentage of violent 
crimes such as murder and armed robbery are committed by people 
under the influence of drugs. 
  Mr. Ayalingo noted with regret that Ghana has been 
identified 
as one of the transit points for cocaine and heroin arriving in 
Europe and North America. Mr. Ayalingo said from 1990 to 1992 
the police seized 13.76 kg of cocaine and 24.87 kg of heroin. 
According to him, figures of 1993 are not available because the 
exhibits are yet to be submitted to the Ghana Standards Board. 
  Mr. Ayalingo disclosed that another drug called crack has 
recently surfaced. He said it is an addictive form of cocaine 
prepared by combining cocaine with sodium bicarbonate, which is 
commonly called baking powder. He pointed out that it is cheap 
but very dangerous. 
  The assistant training officer of CEPS, Mr. F.K. Amusu, said 
because Ghana is being used as a transit point in the 
international narcotic trade, local consumption of heroin and 
cocaine is rising sharply. He said CEPS with its limited 
resources has been able to make a number of arrests and will 
continue to fight against illicit drug trade. 
  Miss Jessica Vapneg, a U.S. lawyer attached to the Faculty 
of 
Law, University of Ghana, Legon, said the couriers from Africa 
account for 20 to 30 percent of heroin and cocaine smuggled into 
the United States. Miss Vapneg said from 1989 to 1992, 164 
Ghanaians were arrested in the United States. 
  The vice chairman of the International Council on Alcohol 
and 
Addiction in Ghana, Mr. Noah Akolatse, appealed to NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations], communities, and individuals to 
assist the group in their fight against drug abuse.

  [Text] Sofia, March 1 (BTA) -- Sofia will join 13 East 
European towns in an EU-initiated project intended to gather 
detailed and reliable information about the number of drug 
addicts and the types of preferred drugs. This was reported 
today at a news conference by participants in a just ended 
seminar on the problems of drug abuse control, organized by the 
Ministry of Science and Education and the Council of Europe. 
  According to Franco Marciale, director of the European Youth 
Centre in Strasbourg, Bulgaria should avoid the mistakes of 
other countries with a long history of drug abuse. Attention 
should be focused on the high-risk groups and the factors 
leading to drug addiction, Mr. Marciale believes. He emphasized 
that teaching a healthy way of life should be a central task for 
both family and school. 
  Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three 
years ago. Even though the country was a transshipment point 
for the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe, few cases of 
narcotics dealing were detected inside Bulgaria until then. 
Over the last few years, drug dealing in this country has been 
on the rise. The number of drug addicts on record has gone up 
from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000, recent statistics 
show. 25 percent of pupils in Sofia have tried or are taking 
drugs now, Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov told the National 
Assembly some time ago. According to a survey conducted by the 
Institute of Forensic Research and Criminology with the Interior 
Ministry, 21.2 percent of juvenile delinquents are substance 
abusers, and 16.5 percent are drug addicts. 
  The cases of drugs trafficking and drug-pushing are 
investigated by a specialized department with the National 
Investigative Service (NIS). According to its head Vladimir 
Stoykov, drug-traffickers and pushers can hardly be convicted as 
the law criminalizes offenses involving expensive goods while 
the prices of drugs in Bulgaria, which have not been updated for 
five years, are low in comparison with those in the West: a 
kilogram of narcotic costs 260,000 leva (about $7,000) if impure 
and twice as much if pure. A 0.25 g. dose of narcotic sells at 
450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov says.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 27 (CTK) -- Loopholes in Czech 
legislation allow "comfortable and risk-free drug selling right 
in downtown Wenceslas Square," Josef Doucha, deputy director of 
the Criminal Police Center, has told CTK. 
  In this situation it is very difficult to take effective 
steps against "the fingertips of the drug mafia," Doucha said, 
pointing to the growing numbers of local consumers of drugs, 
including the "hard" ones such as heroin and cocaine. 
  Last year, the police seized 3.5 kilograms of cocaine, 
almost 
11 kilograms of heroin, 2 kilograms of ephedrine, 3 kilograms of 
morphine and 540 LSD doses. The anti-drug police discovered the 
existence of 18 laboratories equipped for the home production of 
drugs, particularly the "popular" Czech-invented pervitine, 
Doucha said. 
  The legislative loopholes do not allow the "operative drug 
purchase" as is possible in some states where the police can 
"arouse interest in drug sales, and detain the seller and 
confiscate the drug at the moment of the sale," Doucha pointed 
out. 
  He also spoke about organized crime, stressing that Czech 
criminal gangs have been ever better organized and ever more 
tightly integrated into international crime structures. This 
trend is expected to continue in the next years, Doucha added. 
  "Czech organized criminal groups target practically 
everything that is profitable, from thefts of expensive 
foreign-made cars, to financial frauds, to illicit trade in 
drugs, fission materials and weapons, to 
financially-advantageous people smuggling," Doucha said. 
  The Crime Police "disintegrated" in 30 operations last year 
16 crime gangs, all of which included foreigners. Out of the 93 
persons prosecuted, 21 were foreigners. The groups specialized 
in qualified criminal activity, such as bribery, people 
smuggling, murder, robbery and restraint of personal freedom. 
  The police seized in these operations 1.6 million crowns 
(about $54,000)--264 kilogram of Czech-made Semtex explosive, 
186 kilogram of perunit explosive, 1,532 electric fuses, 500 
detonators, 0.6 grams of radioactive californium 252, 33 
illegally possessed weapons, 10 short-wave transmitters, more 
than 1,000 forged or illegally possessed passports and various 
forging instruments, Doucha said. 
  The police also registered 17 cases of racketeering. 
  Foreign gangs are particularly Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese 
and Italian. "Excellent" among them are the Russian gangs which 
specialize in money laundering, racketeering, organized 
prostitution, murders of uncomfortable people and illicit trade 
in drugs, weapons and works of art. They bribe not only Russian 
and Ukrainian, but also Czech entrepreneurs. 
  The mafia-type Camorra from Naples focuses on trade in "fake 
goods", such as imitation leather and silver. 
  Chinese groups specializing in people smuggling combined 
with 
passport forging, money laundering and bribing Chinese 
businessmen is no longer any "novelty" in the Czech Republic, 
Doucha said.

  [Text] Prague Feb 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Romania and Slovakia are increasingly being used as 
transshipment and storage sites in the heroin trade, according 
to the UN's International Council for Narcotics Control. 
  Andreas Nicklisch of the UN Information Centre in Prague 
added that Prague Airport is being used by South American 
businessmen in cahoots with Czech citizens to ship cocaine. 
  The economic and political power of drug cartels is 
increasing, the report says. Drug trafficking is most active in 
countries where there is civil war or where international 
treaties either are being ignored or have not been accepted. 
  Nicklisch said that a UN team is operating in the Czech 
Republic to work out an estimate of what countermeasures are 
necessary to halt the spread of drugs. There is currently a 
project, he said, supporting efforts in the Czech Republic 
directed toward cutting the flow of drugs through the country 
and limiting the establishment of supplies and markets. 
  He also said that Interior Minister Jan Ruml would meet with 
the executive director of the UN programme, Giorgio Giacomelli, 
on March 3-4 to discuss further cooperation between the UN and 
the Czech Republic in drug control.

  [Text] Prague Feb 26 (CTK) -- Josef Lux, chairman of the 
coalition Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL), will sue the responsible persons from the daily 
LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE and demand public apology for the article 
about "strange" financing of KDU-CSL activity published by 
Saturday's [26 February] issue of the daily, the party's 
spokesman Jaroslav Orel told CTK on Saturday. 
  Referring to sources in Prague and Italy, the paper wrote 
that the KDU-CSL Chairman and Deputy Premier, Josef Lux, had 
ordered last March the transfer of three million crowns (about 
100,000 USD) sent to the Czech Republic in October 1992 by 
Italian entrepreneur Leonello Mosca, 45, from Perugia, to his 
party's account. 
  LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE wrote that Mosca had been arrested six 
weeks ago on charges of cocaine trading, but later was released 
on bail and was now living in an unknown place. The three 
million crowns have never been returned to Italy, the paper said. 
  According to it, Mosca allegedly responded to a KDU-CSL 
demand and paid three million crowns to the Ceska Typografie 
publisher, to which LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, then a press organ of the 
Christian Democrats, owed millions of crowns. 
  Nevertheless the debts were paid by the later new owner of 
the paper, Fidelis Schlee, and the three million crowns, 
originally destined for the purpose, were later transferred by 
Lux to his party's account. 
  Orel told CTK that in the summer of 1992 the KDU-CSL 
concluded a preliminary agreement with Mosca's company on the 
establishment of a paper publishing company, but withdrew from 
the agreement in the autumn of the same year. The KDU-CSL has 
also concluded an agreement with Mosca's company on a loan 
repayable on September 30, 1994. The KDU-CSL has never 
challenged the loan and will repay it as agreed, Orel said. 
  He stressed that neither the KDU-CSL nor its chairman "are 
laundering money coming from cocaine trade and from night clubs" 
as the daily alleged. 
  The KDU-CSL sees LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE's attack as reaction by a 
person interested in the purchase of the state-owned publishing 
company Pragopress, Fidelis Schlee, whose bid was turned down. 
These are pressure methods which the KDU-CSL will never accept, 
Orel said. 
  Lux along with another two KDU-CSL ministers--Defence 
Minister Antonin Baudys and Economic Competition Minister 
Stanislav Belehradek--voted two weeks ago against a 
privatisation project under which Pragopress was to be sold to 
Schlee and the direct sale could not be realised.

  [Text] Prague March 3 (CTK) -- The leadership of the 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) 
admits that it probably infringed foreign currency regulations 
when it took out a loan from Italian entrepreneur Leonello Mosca 
in 1992, Executive Deputy Chairman Tomas Rubacek said on 
Thursday [3 March]. 
  A failure to announce taking out a loan is fineable with up 
to 20,000 crowns (about 1,700 USD). 
  But the party considers absurd the accusations published by 
Saturday's [26 February] issue of the Christian-orientated daily 
LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, formerly a KDU-CSL press organ, which alleged 
that the party had committed fraud and laundered money. 
According to the paper, Mosca was arrested for cocaine 
trafficking six months ago, but later released on bail. 
  According to LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, Mosca responded to a KDU-CSL 
demand for a loan of three million crowns (about 100,000 USD) to 
be paid to the Ceska Typografie publisher, to which the paper 
had owed millions of crowns. But the debts were paid by Fidelis 
Schlee, who later became owner of the paper and [KDU-CSL 
Chairman and Deputy Premier Josef] Lux ordered the loan from 
Mosca to be transferred to the KDU-CSL account. The money has 
never been returned to Italy, the paper wrote. 
  Rubacek said that as far as he was informed, KDU-CSL 
Chairman 
Josef Lux on Thursday signed a complaint against the persons 
responsible for the paper article. The party will also demand 
an apology from LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, he added. 
  Rubacek blamed the breach of foreign currency regulations on 
the lawyers which the party had hired, adding that no party 
official had been involved. That is why the party is not 
considering any changes in the leadership, he added. 
  The KDU-CSL has 15 out of a total of 200 seats in the Czech 
parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lt. Colonel Gyorgy Hollosi, head of the </F>
anti-drugs department of the National Police Headquarters, by 
Istvan Boros; place and date not given: "Cocaine: The Largest 
Profit"] 
  [Text] News of large amounts of heroin and hashish 
confiscated by police and customs officials have been increasing 
in recent months. According to pertinent data, a total of 697 
kilograms of drugs were confiscated in 1993, including 427 
kilograms of heroin. On the basis of international experience, 
some experts claim that ten times the aforementioned amount can 
generally be found in Hungary in the form of transit supplies or 
in the illegal trade. We asked Gyorgy Hollosi, head of the 
anti-drug department of the National Police Headquarters, to 
describe the current situation in Hungary, with particular 
emphasis on whether we remained a transit country or have 
already become a target country.... 
  Hollosi: Both formulations are correct. A 
considerable part of the East-West transit is carried out 
through Hungary. The so-called Balkan route goes through 
Hungary now, especially because of the Yugoslav war. It is also 
worth mentioning that an increasing amount of drugs stayed in 
Hungary in the past four years, so we already count as a target 
country as well, especially in the supply of heroin and hashish. 
  Boros: What is the task of your department? 
  Hollosi: Our aim is to catch the suppliers and 
discover their contacts and storage facilities even without 
confiscating one gram of drugs. We are seeking the heads of the 
organization and it is our task to prove the committed crimes. 
  Boros: Are you also making use of special methods 
for this? 
  Hollosi: We are also making use of criminal 
intelligence methods in our investigations . 
  Boros: People say that it is impossible to 
achieve results in the struggle against drug-trafficking without 
informers. 
  Hollosi: That is true. 
  Boros: To what extent are you employing informers? 
  Hollosi: I would not like to say anything about 
our undercover people and informers. However, I can say that we 
catch the criminals through police cooperation in a rather large 
number of cases. 
  Boros: What is your strategic goal? 
  Hollosi: Our strategic goal is to create a 
situation in the wake of which an increasing number of drug 
smugglers avoid Hungary. We want to force them to reorganize 
their supplies to other areas. 
  Boros: Who is actually smuggling drugs? 
  Hollosi: Mostly Kosovo Albanians, and citizens of 
the former Yugoslavia irrespective of nationality, as well as 
Turks, Arabs, and Nigerians. 
  Boros: The amount of seized drugs has increased 
100 times since 1990. Does this mean that the customs officials 
and police are working increasingly well or that this is the 
increase in the amount of drugs smuggled through Hungary? 
  Hollosi: The amount of drugs transported through 
Hungary only increased by about 10 percent in the past four 
years. The apparently huge increase is the result of a 
considerable improvement in the efficiency of investigation. 
  Boros: In the past decades, experts feared an 
explosion on the drug front. Quietly, the available data show 
that this explosion took place in 1990. 
  Hollosi: I would say that that year was a 
decisive one: The flow of classic drugs began, consumer habits 
changed, and the range of various drugs increased. The central 
drug service of the National Police Headquarters was set up in 
1990, and the systematic training of customs officials also 
began in that year. 
  Boros: Where can these drugs be found? 
  Hollosi: First of all in youth clubs and in 
restaurants and bars favored by Yugoslavs and Arabs. 
  Boros: People claim that drugs are supplied to 
kids near the schools. 
  Hollosi: There is no such thing. It is a fairy 
tale that the drugs are hidden in chocolate or chewing gum. On 
the contrary: The drug-dealer clearly tells the young people 
what the stuff is and how much it costs.... It is stupid to 
believe that making people addicted to drugs is free of charge. 
  Boros: Drug trafficking and organized crime are 
almost synonymous concepts. To what extent is the underworld 
present in the drug trafficking in Hungary? 
  Hollosi: According to our data and our 
experience, with the exception of cocaine smuggling, organized 
crime has not yet penetrated this business. The reason is that 
heroin does not yet bring great profit in Hungary. For the time 
being, the smugglers are only scattering the crumbs in Hungary. 
  Boros: What about cocaine? 
  Hollosi: This brings the biggest profit indeed. 
The consumers--including criminals and prostitutes--are people 
with money who can afford to pay 10,000 forints for one gram. 
This is the market that for the criminals is already worth 
handling. In addition, cocaine consumers use this drug in 
well-defended private homes, bars, and massage parlors and, 
thus, it is very difficult to prove the crime. A simple drug 
addict cannot get hold of cocaine because of its high price. He 
would take everything that has any effect. This leads to the 
so-called politoxicomania, and organized crime has not yet 
gained control of this "industry." 
  Boros: Have mafia people dealing with drugs or 
their financial supporters infiltrated Hungarian political and 
economic life? 
  Hollosi: We, policemen, say that it is one thing 
to know something and another thing to prove it. However, no 
people among the political or economic elite are engaged in 
financing the drug traffic, and no such people can be connected 
with drugs. 
  Boros: Where, then, should one look for such 
people, in which social strata? 
  Hollosi: Mostly among the well-known figures in 
the gossip columns. These are ambitious criminals who want to 
appear to be successful entrepreneurs, because they have to 
launder their income from illegal trade.

phenomenon has appeared in Romania today: Mafia-type crime. 
What action are the police and Ministry of Interior taking to 
prevent and fight this social evil? 
  Danescu: When you say that we are facing a new 
phenomenon, you are referring to its novelty for the broad 
public and, maybe, even for you journalists. For us 
professionals, however, Mafia-type crime, that is to say 
organized crime, is neither new nor surprising, because signs of 
it existed in Romania even before December 1989, something which 
I also emphasized a year ago at a news conference. 
  As a matter of fact, it was to be expected that certain 
changes that occurred in Romanian society and its opening-up in 
the post-revolutionary period would offer favorable conditions 
for such developments and for the emergence of negative 
phenomena. [passage omitted] 
  I am mainly referring to illicit organized trafficking in 
drugs, counterfeit money, trade in automobiles stolen abroad and 
sold in Romania and other states, prostitution, the operation of 
international pimps, corruption and smuggling on an unbelievably 
large scale, armed attacks to obtain material gain and maintain 
an atmosphere of civic insecurity, money laundering and hacking 
into banking financial systems, labor-force swindles, illegal 
capital transfers abroad, the introduction into the country of 
large amounts of toxic waste, arms deals, hired killers, and 
blackmail. 
  As far as corruption alone is concerned, I want to mention 
that, in 1990, we uncovered 1,197 such cases; in 1991--4,937; in 
1992--6,043; and in 1993--10,631 cases of offering and taking 
bribes, misuse of one's position, and receipt of undue benefits. 
[passage omitted] 
  The scale of such violations and the increasingly obvious 
tendency of criminals to organize themselves on the basis of 
Mafia-type principles have convinced the Ministry of Interior of 
the necessity to adopt more firm measures to try to control the 
explosion of this phenomenon and stop it from developing. I am 
talking of both creating and perfecting new organizational 
structures and ensuring the appropriate training of our staff 
with special tasks in the area of fighting crime. For example, 
in April 1993, we set up the Brigade for Fighting Organized 
Crime, which has parallel structures at the local level, as well 
as an office for combating corruption with similar departments 
at the level of county police inspectorates and in Bucharest. 
[passage omitted] As expected, the results of these measures 
were not slow in coming; some of them--please forgive my lack of 
modesty--were absolutely spectacular. 
  For example, from April to December last year, employees 
from 
the Brigade for Fighting Organized Crime arrested 67 people from 
whom 11,374,925 [figures as published] kg of drugs were 
confiscated (105,658 kg of cocaine, 93,368 kg of heroin, 11,180 
kg of cannabis, and 1,108 kg of opium). During the same period, 
more exactly in November, we uncovered two operations involving 
the smuggling of stolen automobiles in the counties of Bihor and 
Mures. [passage omitted] I want to specify that investigations 
into 27 counterfeit-money dealers have been finalized; they are 
Romanian and foreign citizens belonging to six groups. 
Investigations have revealed that these people have put into 
circulation counterfeit money amounting to no less than $900,000 
and 35,000 German marks in Romania, the Republic of Moldova, 
Hungary, and Ukraine. 
  It is worth mentioning the action organized by the Romanian 
police, together with the Criminal Police Directorate, in the 
Republic of Moldova, which resulted in the arrest of a network 
of criminals who had been organizing the illegal transit through 
Romania of foreign citizens bound for West European countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  Although these results give us cause for satisfaction, they 
do not make us self-satisfied, because it would be abnormal to 
adopt such an attitude when violent confrontations--admittedly 
rare--are taking place on the streets of Bucharest, some even 
claiming victims. [passage omitted] 
  We are continuing to promote a wide range of measures, 
including increasing the contribution made by other branches of 
the Ministry of Interior, aside from that of the police, which 
are aimed at fighting organized crime, a present-day evil that 
claims human lives and causes tremendous material damage.

<F P=106> [Leonard Doyle article: "Drugs Intelligence Unit Sweeps Into </F>
Action"] 
  [Text] After only two weeks in business, Europol, the new 
drugs intelligence unit of the European Union, is taking credit 
for two international drug sweeps involving the police forces of 
Greece, Belgium and France. 
  The unit, which is based in The Hague, was established to 
combat what the police and politicians describe as an 
ever-escalating threat to European society from the 
international drugs trade and money laundering and organised 
crime associated with it. 
  Seizures show that the quantity and value of drugs being 
shipped to the EU is rising all the time, and the organisations 
bringing it in are increasingly violent. There is further 
evidence of drug traffickers becoming involved in illegal arms 
sales and of links with subversive groups. 
  Colombian drug cartels are shipping cocaine via Spain, 
Eastern Europe and Nigeria, while the classic Balkan pipeline 
for heroin has been diverted by the war in Bosnia. Heroin from 
South-east Asia is transported via Eastern Europe and also by 
courier through Nigeria. 
  Europol's future role has yet to be decided, with some 
countries, like Germany, keen that it should become a fully 
operational European-style FBI. For now it is restricted to 
providing analysis to police narcotics squads. In the fight 
against drug dealers who operate across borders with virtual 
impunity, Europol is providing some badly needed assistance to 
overstretched police forces, which rarely communicate about 
operational matters because of language barriers. 
  For the first time, EU drugs intelligence officers are 
providing instant tactical intelligence, helping to target 
individuals and organisations suspected of planning drug 
operations. Language problems are overcome by having a drug 
liaison officer from each EU country based at Europol's 
headquarters in The Hague. Others provide analysis on the mass 
of intelligence information that is now on tap. 
  EU police are still unable to conduct cross-border 
operations, except for nine Schengen countries (which exclude 
Britain, Denmark and the Irish Republic) when they are already 
in hot pursuit. 
  Jurgen Storbeck, Europol's acting director, said the 
organisation had already intervened to help Greek, Belgian and 
French drugs officers in recent raids, ensuring that two 
international sweeps went off without a hitch. 
  The intelligence back-up they provided allowed police to 
move 
in and make arrests with pinpoint accuracy. The direct computer 
links to national police intelligence services accomplishing in 
hours, what would otherwise have taken weeks. 
  In one case Greek customs arrested three individuals on 
board 
a ship in Patras and discovered 16 kilograms of cocaine hidden 
in its cargo of fruit. "Following consultations here, when it 
was established that the ship had already been under 
surveillance in Antwerp they were able to arrest two Colombians 
and one Greek instead of detaining the ship" and spoiling the 
cargo, Mr Storbeck said. 
  In another case Europol was able to co-ordinate the arrest 
of 
two Italians, three French nationals and a Dutchman after being 
consulted by the Belgian authorities, and putting off moves by 
French anti-drug agents. 
  Not all experts in the drugs trade share Mr Storbeck's 
enthusiasm for Europol. Nicholas Dorn, of Britain's Institute 
for the Study of Drug Dependence, believes that there is too 
much emphasis on beating the trade by concentrating on "top 
trafficking". 
  "This is a vision which does not correspond to reality in 
Britain, nor to general trends in Europe," Mr Dorn said. 
  "If you `top slice' drugs intelligence in this way, then you 
don't get the top of the triangle--there is no triangle; you 
just get a few slithers [as published] of this and that", 
because drug markets are dominated by medium to small players. 
  Mr Dorn describes Europol's and Britain's drugs policy as "a 
giraffe on a virtually tree-less plain". 
  However, fighting the illicit drugs trade has become a top 
vote-winning priority for European politicians and the strategy 
they have adopted is one of areas [as published] where there is 
little dissent in the EU.

police in Frankfurt and Wiesbaden have now arrested nine Kurdish 
men and seized 2.5 kg of heroin. According to information 
released on Thursday, police had certain indications that Kurds 
put large amounts of drugs on the market already at the end of 
last year. In December, six suspects were arrested and 2.6 kg 
of heroin were seized. The operation shows that Wiesbaden has 
meanwhile become a "fixed location on the map of organized 
crime," the police stated.

to send Greece to the European Court for its measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as 
positive. In a statement made today, Venizelos said the EU 
Commission's decision puts the weight on the political aspect of 
the issue, something which the Greek Government has continuously 
stressed. 
  Responding to a question about the revelation in a 
television 
program regarding heroin processing plants in Skopje, Venizelos 
said that the Greek Government will examine the evidence that 
was reported and bring it to the attention of the other Balkan 
countries. He said that it is necessary to clarify the 
situation and the responsible ministers have already been 
informed and are working on the issue.

  [Text] Nine less Greeks killed themselves through drug 
abuse in 1993 than the year before. 
  For the last four years, drug abuse has remained stable in 
Greece--according to official police records quoted in an annual 
United Nations report on narcotics. The number of drug-related 
deaths increased from 66 in 1990 to 79 in 1991 and 1992 but 
dipped to 70 in 1993. During the same period, the number of 
people taken to court over drugs varied from 3,000 to 3,500 
people. 
  Production and consumption of hashish made up the lion's 
share of drug convictions in this country, though cocaine 
offences are growing steadily. 
  Crack, however--hugely popular in countries like the United 
States--remains largely unknown throughout Greece, unlike 
illegally obtained tranquilizers, 17 kilos of which were 
confiscated last year. Tranquilizers are one of the top 
addictions. 
  1991 remains the best recent year for the narcotics squad, 
that confiscated 84 kilos of hard drugs (heroin and cocaine), 
compared to 150 kilos in 1990, 1992 and 1993 combined. 
Internationally, the UN report found that narcotics had taken 
root in all societies, regardless of the cultural and economic 
situation. The report warned that both the financial power and 
political influence of drug cartels were on the increase, with 
drug-trafficking gangs often dividing the products and spoils 
among them. 
  The report also said amphetamines are severely affecting the 
Scandinavian countries and that the use of ecstasy has increased 
dramatically throughout Europe. The drug is now a leading cause 
of night-time road accidents. 
  Based on data given by 140 countries, the report estimates 
that 1994 will see an increase in the demand of codeine-based 
drugs and morphine. In Europe, the use of methadone, as a 
heroin substitute, is expected to rise.

  [Excerpt] Now let's turn once again to crime news. The 
number of factories set up by the Mafia to refine heroin in 
Sicily is much larger than first thought. The news was 
disclosed by the accused in a heroin-processing trial at the 
fortified courtroom-bunker in Rome's Rebibbia Prison. A heroin 
refinery in the area near Trapani was the largest ever uncovered 
in Europe. Gianfranco D'Anna reports. 
  [D'Anna] During the 1980s from Palermo to Trapani every 
Mafia 
clan ran a heroin refinery; a flood of drugs was exported to 
every European capital and to North America. In the underground 
network of hidden refineries in the areas around Palermo and 
Trapani, there are at least 40 well-organized clans, but so far 
only five of these clans have been discovered; four in Palermo 
and another, which is considered to be the most sophisticated 
and dangerous, in Alcamo. 
  Totuccio Contorno, Rosario Spatola, Fabio Savone, and all 
the 
other informers who are being questioned in the fortified 
courtroom-bunker in Rebbibia Prison by Trapani judges, have 
stressed how enormously important the refinery of death at 
Virgini in the suburbs of Alcamo is to the Mafia. In its few 
months of activity, the refinery produced 1,200 kg of heroin and 
was still carrying on with its processing operations when an 
additional 400 kg were discovered. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Kenneth Ahlborn: "Drug Seizure Reflects Trends; </F>
Definite Downward Trend in Hashish"] 
  [Text] There is a definite downward trend in marijuana, but 
an equally pronounced upswing in heroin and in drugs that 
stimulate the central nervous system. 
  "Our statistics on drug seizures over the last five or six 
years reflect attitudes and trends. Hashish is no longer the 
right stuff; people want to be pepped up in order to perform 
their jobs, go to a disco, or do bodybuilding," said Thord 
Ohrstrom, chief of the division for criminal investigations at 
Sweden's national police headquarters. 
  Sociologists and criminologists often feel that police and 
customs drug seizures, expressed in terms of kilos and the 
number of hits, do not adequately indicate the extent of abuse. 
Rather, they measure the effectiveness of the smugglers with 
respect to the authorities in a given year. 
<H5>  According to Statistics </H5>
  "It is, if nothing else, the only statistic with a basis in 
reality that is available to us. If the rate of seizures for a 
particular drug is obviously increasing from year to year 
despite the fact no additional measures have been taken from our 
side, as is the case for amphetamines and heroin in the last 
five years, it means that there is a lot of that drug on the 
market. Clearly it would not be found if there were no customers 
for it," said Orhstrom. 
  The percentage of drugs that is actually seized by customs 
and the police is another point of contention between the police 
and researchers. Ohrstrom believes that he can make a qualified 
guess by comparing the statistics from the UNO [Report on the 
Demographics of Drug Abuse] in the 1980's with statistics on 
drug seizures. 
<H5>  Careful Investigation </H5>
  "The UNO investigation was a thorough and careful 
investigation of the number of drug abusers in Sweden and the 
amount of drugs they consumed. Our statistics on seizures add up 
to approximately 8 percent of the yearly total calculated by 
UNO. It varies a little from drug to drug, of course. It is 
easier to intercept marijuana than cocaine." 
  The 8 percent estimated for 1993 suggests a very sizable 
mountain of drugs in Sweden--5 tons of marijuana, 200 kilos of 
heroin, a ton or more of amphetamines, 100 kilos of cocaine, and 
lesser amounts of LSD, opium, and morphine. Sold on the streets 
by the gram, this would have a total value of 1.5 billion kronor. 
<H5>  Black Market Infrastructure </H5>
  The total annual European consumption, piled up in one 
place, 
is almost impossible to imagine. To smuggle this amount back and 
forth across Europe, while many billions of dollars change hands 
in 100,000 individual transactions, presupposes a very 
smooth-functioning infrastructure. 
  "It is very striking how stable drug prices are. A 0.2 gram 
capsule of heroin, which has long been the standard packaging, 
costs exactly the same now--500 kronor--as it did in 1975. Other 
drugs have not increased in price or have increased very little 
in several decades. It is as though the market did not permit 
prices to rise." 
<H5>  Strong Competition </H5>
  Presumably this has something to do with the strong 
competition in Sweden. 
  "If someone attempts to raise the price, the customer goes 
to 
the next seller. A Mr. X, who can control these transactions, 
cannot be found and has never been found, not even in the heroin 
trade. The Swedish drug trade consists of many small chains and 
none of them predominate," said Ohrstrom. 
  The four drugs: cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines 
have for many years been the major ones in Sweden.

<F P=106> [Article signed SH: "National Council On Repression of </F>
Organized Crime--Swiss Banker Will Be Able To Keep Suspicions To 
Themselves"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Mar (ATS) -- Swiss bankers will have the 
right--but not the duty--to inform the authorities if they have 
reason to believe that the money entrusted to them is the result 
of a crime. The National Council made this decision Wednesday, 
when it defined the new penal rule for combatting criminal 
organizations. This penal rule, which was approved--without 
opposition--by 158 votes, should enter into force on 1 July. 
  Henceforth, bankers, trustees, or other business lawyers 
will 
be able to report their suspicions to the penal authorities 
without any risk of violating banking or commercial secrecy. In 
this way, they will avoid the dilemma of acting contrary to 
either the ban on money laundering, or the obligation of 
confidentiality toward their clients. 
<H5>  Hit Hard </H5>
  Saint-Gall socialist Paul Rechsteiner proposed going further 
by making it the duty of financiers to report their suspicions. 
Switzerland acts as a center for international criminal 
organizations. This is where we have to hit hard, he said. 
Only the obligation to inform will make the law effective, Jean 
Ziegler (Socialist Party, canton of Geneva) added. However, the 
Greens and independents were the only ones who shared this point 
of view. 
  The left wants to introduce the "principle of informing" 
that 
was so dear to the former communist regimes, retorted Suzette 
Sandoz (Liberal Party, canton of Vaud). Generally speaking, the 
majority of Swiss feel that the right to inform is enough, 
especially since an obligation to do so can be introduced at a 
later stage with regard to the laundering of dirty money. 
Federal Councillor Arnold Koller stressed that, in any case, no 
provisions were to imply sanctions to bankers who do not talk. 
The Rechsteiner proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 58. 
<H5>  Definition Contested </H5>
  The left was also beaten on another point: the definition of 
a criminal organization, whose members would be punishable by a 
maximum of five years imprisonment. The following definition 
was chosen: "an organization which keeps its structure and 
staff secret and whose purpose is to commit acts of criminal 
violence or to procure income by criminal means." 
  The socialists feel that this definition is too vague, since 
it could be applied not only to the intended organized crime, 
but also to small-time crime. It would take just three people 
to plan to steal from a large store and you could talk about a 
criminal organization, said Nils de Dardel (Socialist Party, 
canton of Geneva). Hence, the proposal for a more detailed 
definition, which includes the crime of corruption. However, 
this was rejected by 121 votes to 36, while Mr. Koller made 
assurances that no judge would take a small gang of hoodlums for 
a criminal organization. 
<H5>  Burden of Proof On The Accused </H5>
  The broader possibility of confiscating the illicit property 
of criminal organizations was not contested. This should make 
it possible to fight organized crime more effectively, namely by 
depriving it of its operating capital. It will no longer be 
necessary to establish from which specific infraction the 
confiscated securities come. It will be up to the accused to 
prove that his property was acquired legally.

<F P=106> [Article signed GU/UC: "Drug Trafficking Gang Dismantled In </F>
Switzerland And Italy--Ticino Corporal Implicated In Trafficking 
2000 Kg Of Cocaine"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Asti/Lugano, 3 Mar (ATS) -- The Ticino police 
corporal posted to the Agno airport and arrested on 18 February 
has been implicated in the international trafficking of 2,000 kg 
of extremely pure cocaine from Colombia. A series of arrests 
was made last night in Asti and Piedmont as part of the inquiry 
undertaken by the Italian and Swiss police, revealed the 
carabinieri during a press conference. 
  The police operation undertaken jointly by the Italian and 
Swiss investigators and dubbed "San Jose"--the name of the 
Colombian town from where the cocaine leaves--led to a series of 
arrests in Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy) and Ticino. Over a 
month ago, a native of Lugano and his companion were the first 
to be arrested in Asti. 
  On 18 February, the Ticino police put the handcuffs on one 
of 
its own men, a 40-year-old corporal who worked at the Agno 
airport. The man immediately admitted participating in the 
international trafficking of some 150 kg of cocaine, an amount 
that rose to 500 kg a few days later. On 24 February, it was 
the turn of a Lugano bar owner to be arrested. Then, on 2 
March, a 30-year-old Italian employed by the airline Crossair 
was apprehended. 
  On Wednesday, a few hours before the last arrests that took 
place Wednesday night in Asti, the Ticino police announced the 
arrest of a 54-year-old Italian man in a Lugano hotel. The 
police asked the press not to report the story until further 
notice. The silence was broken Thursday by the Italian 
investigators, who revealed the identity of the man arrested in 
Lugano. He is from Milan and is considered the right-hand man 
to the head of the organization, a 28-year-old Colombian. 
  With these latest arrests, operation "San Jose" has put 18 
people behind bars in Italy and Ticino. Only five kilograms of 
cocaine were seized. The trafficking operation, which has been 
going on since 1991, involved some 2,000 kg of drugs with a 
value of 4.5 million Swiss francs. 
  After being exported from Colombia, the cocaine was 
transported by ship to Savona, near Genoa, or by airplane with 
stopovers in Bogota, Santo Domingo, Madrid, Zurich, and Agno. 
The drugs that arrived in the Lugano airport were taken over by 
the crooked policeman and thus avoided customs checks. 
  While the prosecutor, Jacques Ducry, who is in charge of the 
inquiry in Ticino, said Thursday that "for the time being there 
is no link between the arrests in Ticino and those in Italy," 
the names of the Ticino inhabitants implicated were given to the 
Italian police during the press conference in Asti.

<F P=106> [Article by Neil Darbyshire, crime correspondent: "Station </F>
Where Police Are Suspects--45 Officers Accused in Corruption 
Inquiry"] 
  [Text] One of the biggest police corruption inquiries since 
the 1970s has looked at allegations of malpractice against 45 
officers from a station in north-east London, it emerged 
yesterday. 
  More than 130 individual complaints against junior 
detectives 
and uniformed officers at Stoke Newington have been investigated 
in a three year inquiry, codenamed Operation Jackpot. 
  Allegations included planting drugs on suspects, assault, 
theft, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and criminal 
damage. More than 50 allegations related to just five of the 45 
officers. 
  The Police Complaints Authority, who supervised the 
investigation, said a report had been sent to the Crown 
Prosecution Service. 
  It would be up to them to determine if officers would be 
prosecuted, after which Scotland Yard would decide on 
disciplinary charges. 
  Operation Jackpot, which began in April, 1991, was prompted 
by the claims of Pearl Cameron, a convicted drug dealer, who 
said she had evidence that certain Stoke Newington officers were 
dealing in drugs. 
  In the following months, dozens of people arrested for 
dealing drugs, including crack cocaine, came forward to claim 
they had drugs planted on them by detectives from the station. 
  By early 1992, three officers had been suspended and eight 
transferred. 
  One officer central to many allegations was Det-Con Roy 
Lewandowski, who was eventually charged with stealing valuables 
from the home of a man who died after a burglary at his home. 
  He was also accused of planting evidence from the burglary 
scene on two men, who were later convicted. Lewandowski was 
jailed for 18 months in November, 1992, and the two men 
convicted on his evidence were freed last February. 
  Since then another nine people, almost all imprisoned for 
drug offences on evidence by Lewandowski and some of his 
colleagues, have had their convictions quashed. 
  After the most recent appeal in December, Lord Taylor, Lord 
Chief Justice, described police evidence as "tainted evidence 
from a source which ought to be reliable and in which the courts 
should have confidence." 
  In all, Jackpot investigated 22 separate cases. Two others 
were dropped, one because the complainant decided to take out a 
civil action and the other because allegations were withdrawn. 
One officer featured in eight cases, another in seven and three 
in six, while two officers had 11 specific allegations against 
them. 
  During the investigation, the inquiry team took 376 
statements and examined transcripts of police interviews, 
custody records and court proceedings. 
  The complaints authority said a difficulty facing the 
inquiry 
was the "limited co-operation" given by complainants. 
  The first complaint was in September, 1991, and the last in 
August last year, which is why the inquiry was so protracted. 
Three complaints were made two years after incidents to which 
they related. 
  "Whatever the reason for these delays, they did not assist 
the investigation," said an authority spokesman. 
  An organisation calling itself the Hackney Community Defence 
Association has given advice and support to many complainants 
and has built up its own dossier against officers at Stoke 
Newington and Hackney. 
  The association had dealt with 381 complaints against 
officers from the two stations since January, 1989, and was 
supporting 83 civil actions against Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner Paul Condon. 
  Sir John Smith, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan 
Police, said the Jackpot allegations were serious and involved a 
"significant number of police officers"--but only a tiny 
minority in the force. 
  In Stoke Newington, there were "over 300 police officers 
doing a difficult and sometimes dangerous job in that difficult 
policing environment. The majority are untouched by the 
allegations." 
  Sir John said Stoke Newington police had recorded some 
remarkable successes in the battle against local drug dealing.

Antinarcotics Movement"] 
  [Text] The International Committee for Narcotics set up in 
Minsk about a month ago by a number of public organizations from 
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Russia, has received a 
certificate of registration issued by the Belarusian Ministry of 
Justice. This marks the beginning of the activities of the 
committee headed by People's Deputy Viktar Piskarov, former 
interior minister. 
  The committee's working bodies comprise people who formerly 
worked in law enforcement agencies, as well as physicians and 
scientists from the four founder-states. These are different 
people but they have things in common: High professionalism and 
an understanding of the relevance of the problems to be resolved 
by the committee. 
  This is why the multifarious directions of the International 
Committee's activities include a comprehensive education 
project, and the drafting of concepts and programs on preserving 
the genetic health of the nation. The committee will be 
rendering assistance to medical and scientific institutions and 
industrial enterprises for implementing antinarcotic projects.

<F P=106> [Report by Gintautas Jankauskas under the "Justice: Roads </F>
and Mistaken Paths" rubric: "Drug Addicts and Drug Business in 
Lithuania] 
  [Text] For some reason, law enforcement officials are not 
too much inclined to speak about the flourishing drug business, 
the daily growth of drug addicts, and the increase in the crime 
rate committed by them in Lithuania. Statistical reports about 
detained drug users, a few groups of drug traffickers or 
disclosed crimes, or the confiscation of a few kilograms of 
narcotics barely reflect one-tenth of the actual situation. 
  According to the statistics of medical institutions, there 
are 495 drug users and 58 toxicomaniacs recorded in Lithuania. 
Another 262 drug addicts are registered for drug prevention. 
It is unclear what criteria are followed in recording drug 
users. It is obvious, however, that the presented figures are a 
drop in the ocean. According to the specialists from the 
Interior Ministry subunit for control over illegal drug 
production and trade, the number of drug addicts and 
toxicomaniacs in Lithuania is at least ten times larger. 
  The most widespread current drugs in Lithuania are of the 
floral origin produced from poppies. These are opium extract 
and acetylated and pure opium. Last year, the police 
confiscated 963.2 kilograms of ground poppy heads. The fact 
that a kilogram of pure opium allows one to produce as much 
drugs as 900 kilograms of ground poppy heads proves that these 
figures are ridiculously small, while the imports of opium into 
Lithuania is a reality. The police seized 9,525 milliliters of 
pure opium concentrate and 633 grams of pure opium over the last 
year. This year, an entire kilogram of pure opium was found on 
two Kyrgyz residents. According to police officials, the 
imports of pure opium to Lithuania began considerably recently. 
Operative police information show that most often this drug 
reaches our country from Uzbekistan through the Belarusian 
border. 
  The use of marijuana (finely chopped leaves of cannabis) is 
spreading in Lithuania. True, the police managed to confiscate 
only 4.575 grams of this narcotic. They also detected 1.7 grams 
of hashish. Thus far, no synthetic drugs have been discovered 
in our republic. However, they are hardly not in use here. For 
example, back in 1992, a Lithuanian carrying 9 grams of such a 
drug was detained in Denmark. 
  The police frequently confiscate strong pharmaceuticals from 
toxicomaniacs. For example, last year they found 3,780 
"Radedorm" and 371,440 "Metandrostenol" tablets, and others. 
  Police information shows that during last year's operation 
"Poppy '93," they destroyed 6,897 and 158 square meters of poppy 
and cannabis plantations, respectively. However, the poppies 
grown in Lithuania are hardly the key substance for drug 
production. The chief drug traffic reaches Lithuania from the 
southern republics. Currently, the drug business is becoming the 
chief object of activities for most organized criminal groups. 
According to last year's police investigation, every 10th 
organized criminal group in Lithuania engaged in the drug 
business as well. The fact that last year the police succeeded 
in detaining 41 Russian, 10 Azeri, six Ukrainian, four Uzbek, 
and four Georgian residents who tried to sell drugs in Lithuania 
shows that the activities of groups engaging in drug trade are 
very developed. Moreover, several Danish and British citizens 
were arrested as well. 
  Foreign drug traffickers are most often detained only with 
the aid of special police operations, while cases when such 
people are "hooked" at border customs check points are very 
rare. In general, one is left with the impression that drug 
traffickers, particularly southern residents, can slip through 
customs whenever they like. A law on migration has been 
adopted. However, when the police detain some residents from 
the southern republics, it turns out soon that they have arrived 
in Lithuania without any documents or on old Soviet passports. 
This is what the customs stamps in detained persons' passports 
prove. Getting to Lithuania, drug traffickers try to settle 
here for as long a period of time as possible: They set up 
organized gangs, buy apartments in other people's names, 
conclude fake marriages, and so on. Detaining such a foreigner, 
the police often do not know what to do with him or her: 
Deportation from Lithuania requires finances. Pitifully, money 
for such purposes has not been assigned. 
  According to operative police information, there were about 
10 organized criminal groups in Lithuania engaging in drug 
production and trade in 1993. By applying the law on preventive 
detention, some of them were split or even dissolved (a 
five-person group in Anyksciai). A few members of a gang have 
already been detained in Vilnius this year. 
  The police managed to disclose 302 crimes linked with drugs 
in 1993. The largest number of such crimes, 95, were committed 
in Vilnius, 31 in Alytus, and 18 in Visaginas. Charges were 
brought against 157 persons. Incidentally, every sixth of these 
offenders is a female. It is interesting to note that the age 
of the majority of those arrested is between 30 and 49 years of 
age.

Substance? Pork Fat! No, Poppy Straw"] 
  [Text] According to analytical studies of drug-related 
crimes, Ukraine is increasingly becoming a producer of poppies. 
Today, it is one of the bases for opium-production raw 
materials among the CIS countries. As reported by Russian 
law-enforcement bodies, while in the first half of the last 
year, poppy straw [solomka] was mainly supplied from Baltic 
countries, at the end of 1993 it was almost entirely supplied 
from Ukraine. Estimates are in the thousands of kilograms. 
  As regards domestic consumption, in 1992, almost 10 tonnes 
of 
narcotics were confiscated in Ukraine; this amount has doubled 
this year [1993]. Drug abuse treatment centers have 38,000 drug 
addicts on their records.

  A 53-year-old Polish citizen in Frankfurt, Germany, was 
sentenced to five years imprisonment for attempting to smuggle 
4.7 kg of heroin. Miroslaw W., who was a chauffeur at the 
Zairean Embassy in Poland for 14 years, was taken into custody 
in July 1993 on the Polish-German border. The 4.7 kg of heroin 
was found in a suitcase supposedly covered by diplomatic 
immunity, and which was to go to Brussels. The drugs are 
estimated to have a street value of roughly 3 million German 
marks. Miroslaw W. testified that he was totally unaware of the 
contents of the suitcase, and was transporting it on orders from 
Boekwa Lokolo Okombe, councillor at the Zairean Embassy in 
Warsaw. The German prosecutors are currently preparing an 
international arrest warrant for the Zairean diplomat. (Warsaw

  [Text] Lagos, 28 Feb (PANA) -- The United Nations has 
identified "loopholes in the national and international control 
systems" and "the threat of corruption," as drawbacks to the 
global anti-narcotics campaign. "Corruption among government 
and criminal justice personnel is an insidious threat to the 
very principles and effective functioning of the international 
drug control system", Antonio Mazzitelli, a UN Drug Control 
Program [UNDCP] associate field adviser, said Monday [28 
February] in Lagos. He was launching the report of the 
International Narcotics Control Board [INCB] for 1993. 
  The 60-page report highlights "some emerging trends in drug 
abuse and trafficking, analyzes the world drug situation, and 
identifies new or significant trends at the regional and 
national levels." It also examines the operation of the 
international drug control system and the "large-scale abuse of 
pharmaceutical preparations, particularly those containing 
codeine and those often used for cough syrup". 
  The report of the Vienna-based board calls for national and 
international efforts to be stepped up for effective global drug 
control. It warns against the growing abuse of "synthetic 
stimulants" all over the world, and requests international 
cooperation against the phenomena. 
  The board also wants combat measures against the abuse of 
"khat, ephedrone and zipeprol", which it said, have proved fatal 
in Brazil. It noted that the control of "precursors" and 
essential chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs, 
addressed by this convention, still appeared in many countries. 
"While a practical framework for international precursor 
control and cooperation are in place, very few governments avail 
themselves of these opportunities or provide the necessary 
information for the function of such mechanisms," the report 
says, and calls for precursor-control efforts to be strengthened. 
  The report disagrees with the proposal to legalize the 
non-medical use of drugs, saying that the move constitutes "a 
threat to the international drug control system." The board 
stressed the importance of community involvement and monitoring 
of drug abuse situation, and called on governments to place high 
priority on reduction policies. 
  The board based its 1993 report on its visits to 17 
countries 
including Bolivia, Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, 
India, Israel, Kenya, Myanmar [Burma], Nicaragua, Peru, Poland, 
South Africa, Uruguay and Zambia. It also cited a joint mission 
with the UN Drug Control Program to Ethiopia and Cameroon. 
Mazzitelli said the report was being launched simultaneously in 
some 37 countries.

<F P=106> [Zarko Hojnik report: "Heroin Found On A Turk in Hotel Lev"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ljubljana, 25 February -- The achievements of 
our police in combating international drug trafficking are not 
merely coincidental. This has been proven once again with the 
latest success of the Ljubljana criminal police who, after 
several months of cooperation with the Italian security organs, 
arrested a 49-year old Turkish citizen, Alija, in one of the 
rooms of the Hotel Lev in Ljubljana yesterday. During the 
search they discovered 5 kg of heroin in a secret place in the 
toilet, which is worth nearly 400,000 German Marks. [passage 
omitted] 
  Simultaneous with this success of our criminal police a 
question poses itself as to how the aforementioned group of drug 
traffickers managed to smuggle 5 kg of heroin through the 
customs control at Brnik airport [near Ljubljana] without being 
spotted by an X-ray machine or customs officers. It seems that 
the airport is well known to the international drug traffickers, 
as allegedly being the place where one can dodge customs 
controls from time to time. However, we must recall the case 
from the recent past when policemen, with the help of dogs 
trained to search for drugs, managed to discover 11 kg of heroin 
at Brnik airport. Of course, this is not the last seizure of 
this type here, as the criminal police hold information about 
new smugglers. [passage omitted].

monitored through 10 March. 
<H5>  Argentina </H5>
  National Border Police personnel on 7 March seized nearly 27 
kg of cocaine in Oran, Salta Province, near the Bolivian border. 
The drug was in the luggage of two Nigerians and one Jamaican 
who traveled in a bus that had just entered Argentina. One of 
the Nigerians was identified as Nnamdi Robert Male, a soccer 
player for a very popular Nigerian soccer team. They were 
planning to go to Buenos Aires and then board a plane for 
London, where they were to sell the drug. (Buenos Aires CLARIN

  [Excerpts] Mar del Plata -- "The average age of people who 
start consuming drugs is 11," President Carlos Menem said in 
inaugurating the 15th regular session of the Inter-American 
Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), an 
organization subordinate to the OAS. 
  The president said security organizations' and armed forces' 
operations to neutralize drug trafficking have not been 
effective and advocated more emphasis on legislation better 
adapted to reality and on education. 
  Accompanying Menem were CICAD President Monica Nagel, also 
Costa Rica's justice vice minister; CICAD executive secretary 
Irving Tragen from the United States; and General Pueyrredon 
Mayor Mario Russak. [passage omitted] 
  Menem said in his message that "security organizations and 
the armed forces have tried to neutralize the scourge of drug 
trafficking, adding, however, that the results have not been 
very encouraging. Each year drug traffickers have more money. It 
is known that drug traffickers move more than $6 billion per 
year, which is more than the budget of many states." 
  The president then talked about the need for common 
legislation on the matter in all countries in order to become 
more efficient. He also mentioned the proposal of those who 
think of legalizing consumption and those who propose the 
destruction of cultivated areas. The president said: "However, 
we must attack the problem at the roots. The problem is one of 
education." 
  The president mentioned that "the average age of people who 
start consuming drugs is 11," adding that since the beginning of 
his administration the number of beds for treating drug addicts 
has increased from 85 to 3,000. 
  The CICAD meeting, which is being attended by 
representatives 
from 24 American countries, will continue until 11 March.

  [Text] The Federal Police arrested former Bolivian 
President Luis Garcia Meza in Sao Paulo this morning. The 
former president was hiding in an apartment located in a 
neighborhood close to the airport and carried a false Brazilian 
passport. He was taken into custody together with his 
aide-de-camp, Colonel Roberto Rico. Both of them had been 
charged with being implicated in an international drug 
trafficking network. Garcia Meza had been sentenced to 30 
years' imprisonment and was a fugitive from Bolivian justice.

  [Text] Today we received one of the most important pieces 
of news of the year, a true happening, a news bomb, if you 
permit me the exaggeration, because it is something really 
significant. 
  The arrest of former President Luis Garcia Meza has been 
officially confirmed. The news has shaken the country. The 
capture occurred in Brazil. But I would prefer that Minister of 
Government German Quiroga inform you himself, through a special 
note prepared by Gabriela Orosco at Government Palace. The 
minister made official what we advanced at noon today. This is 
the official communique, read around 1230. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] The government reports to the 
public the following: 
  1. Citizen Luis Garcia Meza, former de facto president of 
Bolivia, who was condemned by the Supreme Court to 30 years 
imprisonment without pardon, was captured early today in the 
Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 
  2. Citizen Garcia Meza surrendered without offering 
resistance. He was captured while returning to his residence. 
Garcia Meza was staying in that city with false documents. 
  3. This has been an operation coordinated by Bolivian and 
Brazilian authorities working together. 
  4. The Foreign Ministry is taking steps before the Brazilian 
Government to extradite Garcia Meza to Bolivia. 
  This is all the information we can release at this time. 
Thank you. [end recording] 
  This was what the minister of government said in making 
official what was learned unofficially through the state channel 
at noon today. 
  Let us ratify the information. Luis Garcia Meza was arrested 
at Guarulhos Airport -- one of the two international airports in 
that important Brazilian city -- by the airport police at around 
0800 this morning. At the time of his arrest he was accompanied 
by Gualberto Rico, who was one of his assistants during his 
1980-1981 dictatorship. Rico was arrested for carrying false 
documents. The airport police arrested Garcia Meza on charges 
of carrying false identity documents. 
  Two possibilities are being studied: first, his extradition; 
and second, that he be expelled to Bolivia. Apparently the 
Brazilian Government does not want anything to do with Garcia 
Meza; it does not want to hold him a single minute longer than 
necessary, and it might want to deliver him to Bolivian 
authorities immediately. [passage omitted on historical 
background]

  [Excerpts] The case involving the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR] and its alleged links to drug 
trafficking has been submitted once again to FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force]. A decision will be made in the next few 
hours. 
  The decision by the Chamber of Deputies' Constitutional 
Committee to put the investigation of MIR and its alleged links 
to drug trafficking in the hands of the Special Antinarcotics 
Force once again has caused surprise. The decision was 
surprising because the Chamber of Deputies had decided that the 
committee would investigate the cases. However, things changed 
after a suspicious -- so to speak -- visit by U.S. Embassy 
officials to committee Chairman Edil Sandoval 
  [Begin recording] 
  Sandoval: Well, what has actually occurred is that 
the Chamber of Deputies has ordered an investigation focusing 
exclusively on possible links between MIR leaders and drug 
trafficking. In other words, it is an area in which the chamber 
has ordered an investigation but, I reiterate, it will focus on 
MIR leaders allegedly linked to drug trafficking. 
  That is to say, there will be no interference in the 
investigations being performed by FELCN into the problem as a 
whole, that is, the fight against drug trafficking. The 
committee is not interfering with those activities. We will 
concentrate our investigation on MIR leaders who might be linked 
to drug trafficking. 
  Unidentified reporter: However, yesterday ... 
[changes pattern] today newspapers published a statement by you 
saying that the matter could be returned to FELCN. 
  Sandoval: A minor disagreement has arisen, and we 
will continue to debate it in the committee. It refers to the 
fact that a brief, fast analysis of case folders has revealed -- 
especially to me -- that the FELCN investigation is not over 
yet. Even the report FELCN has submitted to the judicial branch 
is an investigation that has not been finished yet. I have 
concluded therefore that this investigation, which -- I 
reiterate -- is not over yet, should continue and that we -- 
despite the mandate we received from the Chamber of Deputies -- 
should not interfere in that investigation. That is why I 
suggested to the Constitution Committee that all the 
investigations the FELCN is currently conducting be submitted to 
the committee upon their completion and not to the regular 
courts. The proposal's objective is to prevent the overlapping 
of work and to concentrate all matters involving political 
leaders under the committee's jurisdiction. 
  Reporter: Did the courtesy visit by U.S. Embassy 
officials have anything to do with this? 
  Sandoval: No, not at all, because I made the 
decision before the visit by the Embassy officials. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 6 Mar (EFE) -- Coca leaf producers and 
Bolivian police clashed violently in the Chapare region, some 
600 kg east of La Paz, during the past few hours. An 
undetermined number of individuals were injured. 
  According to Jorge Martinez, president of Chapare's five 
coca 
producers' federations, "some peasants" died during the clashes, 
a report that was denied by Interior Minister German Quiroga who 
said that only one police agent and two members of the official 
Coca Reconversion Directorate (Direco) were injured. 
  Some 50 peasants armed with machetes, stones, and sticks 
clashed on 5 March with some 100 Mobile Police Unit for Rural 
Areas (Umopar) and Direco agents who intended to eradicate coca 
leaf plantations which, according to authorities, were being 
used for drug trafficking. 
  The peasants set various Umopar vehicles on fire, but Umopar 
forces repelled the attack with machine gun fire from 
helicopters. 
  This is the second violent clash with peasants in the 
Chapare 
region within the past 10 days. The clashes are the result of 
the government's determination to destroy excess coca 
cultivation that is being used for manufacturing cocaine and not 
for the traditional and legal coca leaf consumption. 
  The interior minister today told Radio Panamericana of La 
Paz 
that the Umopar agents' operation in Chapare on 5 March only 
intended to eliminate coca plantations that include maceration 
pits, which are used for cocaine production. 
  Quiroga said the Bolivian Government does not intend to 
eliminate all excess coca leaf plantations by force, adding that 
police only seek to eliminate plantations that include 
facilities for cocaine production. 
  According to the minister, other excess coca plantations 
must 
be eradicated voluntarily by peasants with the cooperation of 
local authorities and through the alternative development 
program. 
  Chapare region peasants, however, accuse the government of 
trying to forcefully eliminate all coca leaf plantations. 
  The Bolivian Government is committed to eradicating a 
certain 
number of coca leaf plantations annually in exchange for 
substantial U.S. economic assistance. 
  Bolivia is the second largest coca leaf producer in the 
world, after Peru, and the second largest cocaine exporter in 
the world, after Colombia.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has also 
commented on the clashes that occurred in Chapare. During a 
news conference, the president commented on the drug trafficking 
issue. He said Bolivia and his administration are coexisting 
with a time bomb because Law 1008 obliges the government to 
eradicate 1 hectare of coca for every cocaine maceration pit 
that is found. He said this is the cause of the problems. 
  [Begin Sanchez de Lozada recording] This causes the problem: 
We have been finding large production centers of cocaine base, 
which is purchased by the main cocaine producers who transform 
this base into cocaine. This concerns us. [end recording] 
  Asked if his administration will defend coca production, he 
said: 
  [Begin recording] Of course we will defend it. Coca is part 
of our society. It is a consumer product, but we cannot protect 
coca production in the Chapare region where it is grown 
exclusively for drug production, for cocaine production. You 
know very well that if you offer Chapare coca leaves to miners, 
they will refuse to chew them. Miners and peasants only chew 
coca grown in Yungas. This, however, is no reason to simply 
eradicate this coca and fill our country with violence. We must 
find solutions to this problem and these solutions can only be 
found through dialogue. Pressure from abroad is great and 
domestic damage is also great. We cannot forget that Bolivia is 
already beginning to have (addicts) and drug consumption 
problems. Cocaine base is a very bad drug. [end recording]

  [Text] One person dead and 18 wounded is the result of coca 
producers' resistance to the government's determination to 
eradicate coca plantations. Amalia Pando prepared the following 
report: 
  [Begin recording] 
  Pando: Coca producers staged a massive ambush of 
80 Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] and Direco [Coca 
Reduction Directorate] agents and (chaqueadores) in Entre Rios 
between 0300 and 0600 on 5 March. As a result, one person was 
killed, 18 wounded, five individuals were taken hostage, and two 
jeeps and three pickup trucks were dynamited and set on fire. 
  This is how Interior Minister German Quiroga reported what 
happened in Chapare: 
  Quiroga: We discovered two maceration pits in this 
area [pointing at map]. Our instructions in these cases is to 
destroy 1,300 square meters of coca plantations, that is, 10 
percent of an hectare, more or less. Nearly 1,000 peasants stood 
by while we destroyed that coca. They accepted the destruction 
of the crops around the two pits, which they could clearly see. 
  When Direco and Umopar forces started back to their vehicles 
parked on the road, they encountered a first group of peasants 
-- about 1,000 of them -- who were told that the people who were 
leaving were those who destroyed the maceration pits and the 
coca crops around them. The peasants opened the way and let them 
pass. 
  But after walking another 250 meters they encountered a 
second group of peasants -- also about 1,000 strong -- who 
blocked their way out. When the officials tried to withdraw they 
realized that the first group was behind them. Therefore, what 
happened here was an ambush. Between 2,000 and 2,500 peasants 
ambushed Umopar agents, Direco forces, and the coca cutters 
[macheteros] who came with them. They were all ambushed by the 
2,000 peasants. 
  Among them, nearly 500 were (chacas) and (boleros). (Chacas) 
are people who trade coca leaf while (boleros) collect cocaine 
paste. Nearly 25 percent of these 2,000 individuals were not 
peasants; they were not from the area. This was noticeable 
because of the way they dressed. They wore shorts, dark glasses, 
striped garments, etc. 
  The peasant leader then gave the order to attack. 
  Unidentified reporter: How large was the 
government force that was attacked? 
  Quiroga: Approximately 80 individuals, including 
soldiers and those waiting in the vehicles. 
  As a result of the confrontation that followed the attack 
ordered by the peasant leaders, eight Umopar agents were 
wounded, including an officer who is in serious condition and is 
being treated at (Huayanini) Hospital in Santa Cruz. Ten Direco 
officers also were wounded. One of the prosecutors who followed 
the operation -- all operations are controlled by prosecutors 
under the Special Antinarcotics Force's charter -- also was 
wounded. He was speared in the abdomen and taken by helicopter 
to Cochabamba. In all, 18 people were injured during the 
confrontation and one individual died. He was a Direco employee. 
The peasants took three hostages. They are still being kept 
hostage at this minute. Two other Direco officials disappeared 
and their whereabouts are unknown. 
  Pando: Minister Quiroga said no one was injured 
among the peasants because Umopar forces did not use their 
weapons. The exception was a peasant who lost a hand trying to 
place a dynamite stick under a truck. Quiroga said the five 
vehicles waiting to pick up the coca cutters were dynamited, and 
that on the afternoon of 5 March another crowd set Direco 
offices in Ivirgazama on fire. Quiroga added that Umopar was 
able to disconnect a bomb made up of three small barrels filled 
with explosives. 
  Regarding the identification of the machete holder who died 
in the ambush, Quiroga said his name is not known because the 
body remains in the hands of the peasants, adding that one of 
the hostages who managed to escape saw him. Quiroga said no one 
has been arrested so far, adding, however, that those 
responsible for the 5 March ambush and attacks will be arrested 
and placed at the disposal of the courts. 
  Quiroga insisted that the government is ready to talk with 
Chapare leaders and is waiting for the confirmation of a meeting 
arranged with them in principle for 9 March [end recording].

  [Text] Peasant leader Evo Morales of the Chapare coca 
growing region has made an appeal to the Cochabamba prefect 
because of the peasants' uncertainty and desperation in face of 
the government plans to reduce coca plantations by force. 
  He said: "I have great admiration for the prefect. I believe 
he enjoys great sympathy not only among the coca growers but 
also among the people of Cochabamba, and his own party. This is 
why I would like to ask him to implore to his son (director of 
the Agricultural Reconversion Directorate) to prevent the 
suffering of coca growers by ordering the suspension of the 
mandatory coca reduction." 
  Less than three weeks ago the son of the prefect, whose name 
is also German Lema like his father, took over the Agricultural 
Reconversion Directorate which has the responsibility of 
implementing the coca eradication policy throughout the country. 
  Morales said he made the appeal with the understanding that 
the first political authority of Cochabamba, due to his great 
humanitarian feelings, could intercede and "even order the 
suspension of the coca eradication plan because this would be an 
instruction not only from a father but from the prefect." 
  The coca growers believe the government pretext for reducing 
coca plantations is exaggerated and responds to pressure from 
U.S. organizations interested in eliminating coca. 
  He said: "The government knows that the Chapare region is a 
zone highly influenced by drug trafficking. The government knows 
this well, therefore the justifications for reducing coca are 
not solid and awaken greater susceptibility on the credibility 
of the government operations." [sentence as published] 
  The peasants of the Chapare region are afraid and they do 
not 
want to leave their land to preserve their coca plantations 
which, according to several governments, represent the basis of 
the national economy. 
  Morales, who is going to Lima to attend an international 
meeting of peasants, said he will meet with Nobel Peace Prize 
winner Rigoberta Menchu to report the government plans, and to 
ask her to send a letter to the president asking him to stop the 
coca reduction project.

  [Text] Peasant defense patrols are patroling the Cochabamba 
tropical region to avoid a compulsory reduction of coca 
plantations. 
  There is "a group of unarmed coca producers who, at the 
first 
attempt to force them to reduce their plantations, will blow 
their pututos [native Bolivian musical instrument] to summon the 
people." 
  Felipe Caceres, conflicts secretary of the Coca Growers 
Federation, said that if necessary the growers will arm 
themselves with sticks, machetes, picks, and big hoes to drive 
away those who try to destroy the plantations without giving 
anything in exchange." [no opening quotation marks as published] 
  Caceres said that the coca growers only seek to protect 
their 
interests and that "under no circumstances do we intend to 
protect drug traffickers. We believe trafficking is one of the 
scourges to affect the Chapare zone. It brings unrest to the 
coca growers. The repression organizations, however, should 
take care of this task. We should not interfere in this work." 
  The peasants declared a general mobilization at the 
grassroots level after government organizations this week 
destroyed seven hectares of plantations in Senda Bayer and Villa 
Pagador, the excuse being that maceration pits used for 
producing cocaine paste had been found nearby. 
  The peasant organizations have organized "union watch 
groups" 
to control any infiltration of alien individuals who seek to mar 
the coca growers' image. 
  The coca growers have thus managed to halt the government 
elimination of what it regards as surplus plantations which, 
according to the government, surpasses 35,000 hectares in the 
Chapare and Yungas region.

  [Excerpts] The Bolivian Labor Federation [COB], coca 
growers, and government representatives continue to meet in an 
effort to reach agreement over the eradication of coca 
plantations in Chapare. 
  Following last night's meeting with government officials, 
the 
Chapare coca growers were today satisfied with the progress. 
  [Begin coca growers' leader Evo Morales recording] At the 
start of the meeting, the government apologized to coca growers 
for having accused them of producing drugs. [end recording] 
  He added that the government is also willing to end the 
forceful eradication of plantations: 
  [Begin recording] This will definitively ease social tension 
in tropical Chapare and prevent confrontations. This is 
basically what we have accomplished. It is not enough. 
Discussions should go deeper into the technicalities and the 
institutional framework of alternative development to see how 
the government can guarantee funds for true alternative 
development. [end recording] 
  Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, adviser to coca growers, said the 
end of forceful eradication in return for peasants joining the 
voluntary eradication plan -- which involves financial benefits 
per eradicated hectare -- is a trap by the government. In an 
effort to prevent coca growers from signing an agreement to this 
end, Barrenechea went today to the Labor Ministry where a final 
meeting is being held to consider the subject. [passage omitted] 
  Coca growers have backed down on their decision to sign an 
agreement on the topics agreed upon last night. They will not 
agree to any type of eradication. They admitted, however, that 
there are new illegal coca farms in Chapare. They said they 
will defend them, because -- as they put it -- the government is 
to blame. 
  [Begin Morales recording] In the face of the unfulfilled 
promises and the lack of alternative development, we have no 
alternative but to plant coca. The peasants are not to blame 
for planting coca. It is the free market policy, the free 
importation policy which is encouraging coca growing, not just 
in Bolivia but in the entire Andean region. [end recording]

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, private 
secretary to former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, today 
reported that police agents attempted to kidnap her in Santa 
Cruz, and that by mistake they arrested and held for several 
hours her niece, Luisa Rodriguez. 
  Seleme's niece confirmed that on 3 March she was detained by 
a group of individuals, apparently policemen, who detained her 
for several hours while they questioned her about her aunt. 
  A Bolivian radio station today reported that Susana Seleme 
had been arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. 
Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want to either confirm 
or deny this report, and Seleme herself denied to EFE in a 
telephone conversation from her home that she had been arrested. 
  Susana Seleme, together with some leaders of her party, the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), denounced before 
District Attorney Francisco Borenstein the kidnapping of her 
niece by a group of six armed men, and accused the antinarcotics 
police and the U.S. DEA of political harassment. 
  Seleme said she feels harassed by the U.S. Embassy in La Paz 
over her old and excellent relations with the Cuban Government, 
and especially with Fidel Castro. 
  Sources from the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
consulted by EFE in La Paz said that no orders had been issued 
to carry out an operation like the one described by Seleme, 
because any such procedure -- that is, an arrest -- is always 
carried out within the law. 
  Other FELCN sources said that the role of the DEA is 
restricted to logistical support and the processing of 
information obtained from drug enforcement operations. The 
sources said DEA agents do not participate in this kind of 
operations, in compliance with bilateral agreements signed 
between Bolivia and the United States. 
  Drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez testified before a 
dangerous substances judge in La Paz that Susana Seleme 
allegedly protected drug traffickers. 
  Dominguez said that the MIR leadership met on several 
occasions with Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, allegedly the greatest 
drug trafficker in Bolivia, who was arrested last January by the 
FELCN, to discuss the financing of Paz Zamora's party campaign. 
  Susana Seleme's niece today told EFE that during the 
afternoon of 3 March she left Seleme's house in Santa Cruz and 
got into a "radio- taxi," which was intercepted fewer than 100 
meters from where she got into it by three vehicles, from which 
six armed men emerged. 
  "They told me: Get out, Susana Seleme. I took off my 
sunglasses and told them that I was not Susana," Luisa Rodriguez 
said, adding that although the men did not show their 
identification cards they said they belong to the FELCN. 
  The men, Rodriguez said, got into the "radio-taxi," ordered 
the driver not to communicate with his central radio system, and 
then began to question Rodriguez. 
  Meanwhile, given that Luisa Rodriguez was taking a long time 
to arrive at her destination, Susana Seleme called the 
"radio-taxi" central, which with the aid of other taxis quickly 
found Rodriguez' car, Seleme said. 
  Susana Seleme asked District Attorney Borenstein to 
accompany 
her to the place together with a police patrol, where they 
arrived a little while after the men returned her identification 
documents to her niece and told her that they had nothing 
against her or her aunt.

  [Text] The Human Rights Committee is investigating the 
alleged torture of people arrested on drug trafficking charges. 
Here is Mario Espinosa's report: 
  [Begin recording] 
  Espinosa: Drug trafficking continues to be of 
paramount importance here in Bolivia, and particularly in 
Congress. Five people who were arrested in Chonchocorro have 
visited the Human Rights Committee office. They are testifying 
in the case of the DEA safe houses, and what they call the 
constant human rights violations by DEA agents. This is why 
policemen can now be seen at Congress. 
  The Human Rights Committee has several reasons for beginning 
this investigation: One originated in the United States, where a 
communique reports that human rights violations are being 
committed under the guise of the antinarcotics struggle. 
  Outside the committee's office, people were saying the 
arrested people were giving detailed reports of the torture 
sessions they endured at the DEA safe houses. 
  This was confirmed by Juan del Granado, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Human Rights Committee: 
  Granado: We will continue the investigations to 
prove or disprove charges that have been made public and which 
we received today. These are the starting point for the 
investigation. We are concerned about this situation because we 
have repeatedly received charges that Special Antinarcotics 
Force, FELCN, agents are torturing Bolivian citizens under the 
guise of judicial police investigations. If this is the case, 
the legislative branch will adopt drastic measures. 
  Espinosa: Juan del Granado clearly said it: We 
cannot accept that one crime should be used to fight other 
crimes. If the charges are proven there will be sanctions. [end

  [Text] The "war" waged by rival drug traffickers of 
Mangueira shantytown, which have already resulted in 14 deaths, 
reveals that the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command) are 
becoming weaker and more divided. This change began in the late 
1980's following the arrest of the main leaders. 
  This version on the situation of trafficking in the Rio de 
Janeiro shantytowns -- with incidents during the past years -- 
is upheld by a "friend" of CV leaders who chose to remain 
anonymous. He said that the "media" has created an image of 
power that these groups never enjoyed. He added: "Moreover, 
most drug traffickers have always been independent." 
  Another person who does not believe in the power of the CV 
and TC as organizations is Prosecutor Raphael Cesario, 55, who 
believes that this oversizing -- nourished by some policemen -- 
is designed to protect the true cocaine and weapons traffickers: 
The numbers game operators. Cesario says people "are stupid" if 
they believe the great traffickers "live in shantytowns 
surrounded by cockroaches and open sewers."

<F P=106> [Article by Sergio Torres] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian cocaine and marijuana for Russian rifles, 
machine guns, bombs, and ammunition. This exchange is allegedly 
being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African 
guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons 
manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro 
PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship 
between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla 
elements. 
  Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira, 
42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for 
weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro 
shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member 
countries. 
  The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio 
de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early 
this week interrupted the "war" between drug rings that has 
already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made 
AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800 
shots per minute. 
  Oliveira said that foreign weapons acquired by the Rio de 
Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States) 
and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: "Russian weapons do 
not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or 
ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay." 
  The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons 
may 
be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian 
countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult 
phases of regional wars and battles. 
  Oliveira commented: "Russian weapons are cheaper because 
there are great quantities of them in African countries in 
conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as 
these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for 
sale." 
  The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground 
organizations 
and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire 
may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists. 
  A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may 
be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen 
for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the 
Nigerian connection. 
  Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of 
supermarket for the population of poor African countries. 
Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come 
to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with 
all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances). 
  The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not 
representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of 
maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations 
such as the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command). 
  Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and 
foreign 
weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel 
investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came 
to the same conclusion. 
  The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has 
identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and 
federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that 
usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the International 
airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers. 
  One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil 
Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter 
Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to 
Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the 
police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. 
Jogador has cocaine and marijuana "sale spots" in the 
Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de 
Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Hitoshi Tanabe, 32, one of the most 
wanted members of the Japanese mafia (Yakuza), was arrested on 7 
March on a warrant issued by the Brazilian Supreme Court at the 
request of the Japanese Government. Tanabe is the leader of 
Dinshoukai, a faction of Yamaguchi-gumi, one of the main mafia 
organizations in Japan. The Federal Police [PF] arrested him in 
Londrina, Parana State. 
  Police officer Itanor Neves Carneiro said: There are strong 
indications that there are other Yakuza members in the country. 
  The PF suspect that Tanabe came to Brazil to run an 
international drug trafficking ring and to send Brazilian women 
to Japan to work as prostitutes. The extradition request was 
based on the seizure of 5.8 kg of cocaine in the Japanese city 
of Shizuoka in February 1993. It was the fifth largest seizure 
of cocaine in Japan, an amount worth $4 million in Japan and 
$90,000 in Brazil. At that time trafficker Takahiro Shiba 
confessed to the Japanese police that the cocaine had come from 
Brazil, and that it belonged to Tanabe. 
  Like most Yakuza members, Tanabe has tattoos on his body 
from 
his chest down to his ankles. Upon his transfer to Sao Paulo, 
Tanabe confirmed that he is a ranking member of Yamaguchi-gumi, 
but declined to give details. Nor did he want to explain why 
one digit of the little finger on his left hand had been severed. 
  Tanabe has a daughter born in Brazil -- Mary, 10 months old 
-- and was living with her and his Japanese wife, Kiyomi, in 
Brazil.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Tessler] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Judge Antonio Carlos Amorim, president of 
the Rio de Janeiro Court, yesterday said that a Brazilian 
political party is being financed with "illegal money" from 
Italy. Without specifying the party, the judge said that it is 
one of the favorite parties for the October elections. In this 
regard he asked for help from his Italian colleagues to 
investigate the trafficking in money and, if possible, to stop 
it. 
  Says Amorim: "Our main concern is that this party could gain 
power in Brazil financed with money produced by illegal 
activities in Italy. This poses a risk for Brazil, which could 
be governed by a party of illegal deals, of illegal money." 
  He added: "I do not know the origin of the money, whether it 
originates with the mafia or with drug trafficking. The 
information was leaked, and I only confirmed it." He was 
referring to an Italian television report that the party is 
being financed by the mafia and by drug trafficking. 
  Amorim met yesterday with Rome District Attorney Vittorio 
Mele and with the group of Italian judges who visited Brazil 
last year to investigate Brazilian links with the Italian 
corruption network: Vittorio Paraggio, Maria Teresa Saragnano, 
and Mario Almerighi. He also met with Justice Minister Giovanni 
Conso. Amorim passed secret information to the judges on 
investments by Italians in Brazil made with money coming from 
illegal sources. 
  He said: "Whoever finances a party abroad, investing cash, 
does it because he expects a major economic return in the 
future. In my capacity as a judge I cannot identify the party, 
despite the fact that everyone in Brazil knows which party it 
is. It is a party with strong candidates for the October 
elections, and which wants to gain power." 
  Amorim also met with Giovanni Galloni, the vice president of 
the Superior Council of Magistrates, with whom he exchanged 
views on the work of the courts in the two countries. In the 
opinion of Amorim, the Brazilian judicial branch is the only 
institution without indications of corruption.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 
publishes in its 6 March edition, on page 16, four articles by 
Octavio Guedes and Renato Garcia about alleged links between the 
Comando Vermelho [Red Command] drug trafficking gang and the 
illegal animal lottery bankers. 
  The first 400-word article states that police have realized 
that the Comando Vermelho chiefs imprisoned in Bangu I 
penitentiary do not have the wealth that all their criminal 
actions should have given them. Police and judges believe the 
real chiefs of these organizations are not in the slums, where 
there is no infrastructure to launder dollars, import drugs, or 
purchase imported weapons. According to the testimony of some 
gang members, all the money collected in the drug markets, 
nearly $2.5 million per month, was administered by an illegal 
animal lottery banker known as Carlos Alberto Goncalves dos 
Santos, aka Carlinhos Barbudo, who is currently at large. 
  A 200-word article states that the first time the full 
extent 
of the criminal gang was discovered was in the gang case in 
Borel Hill where close links between community leaders and drug 
traffickers were demonstrated, as well as the existence of a 
"court" to judge those who oppose the laws of the drug 
traffickers, who organize parties to attract drug buyers and 
youths for prostitution. Police found out that about 140 people 
were involved in this illegal scheme in some way. 
  Another 200-word article reports on the activities of 
Carlinhos Barbudo, who was named as the "owner" of the illegal 
animal lottery's gambling sites. According to a gang leader's 
wife, he was the treasurer for the drug markets, and other gang 
members testified that he personally paid drug suppliers. 
  The last 200-word article quotes Rio de Janeiro Civil Police 
Chief Nilo Batista as saying: "Nobody can tell who is the 
Comando Vermelho gang's chief." He says he believes that a good 
portion of the drug trafficking money moved in Rio de Janeiro is 
spent on the drug markets' structure and the purchase of weapons 
and drugs. The remaining money is used to pay bribes to police 
and informers. Nilo Batista maintains that the organizational 
level of the Comando Vermelho gang is very low. The 
best-organized gang, he says, is that headed by drug trafficker 
Orlando da Conceicao, which exploits drug markets in eight slums 
in northern Rio de Janeiro. Police say there is no evidence to 
link the illegal animal lottery bankers with drug trafficking, 
and the Brazilian drug traffickers arrested so far are not rich 
like the Bolivian coca "barons."

  [Text] In Mato Grosso do Sul State, the federal highway 
police have seized another 10 kg of high-quality cocaine that 
were being carried to Sao Paulo in hidden compartments built 
into an Opala [a Brazilian-made Chevrolet model] trunk. 
  The cocaine shipment was intended for the Nigerian 
connection 
in Sao Paulo State. The arrest of a Bolivian citizen indicates 
a new tactic by the traffickers on the Bolivia-Sao Paulo route. 
  Antonio Omar Sanchez, a Bolivian merchant living in Sao 
Paulo, is under arrest. He was caught during a routine 
operation carried out by the federal highway police on the 
BR-262 Highway. 
  In the federal highway police's opinion, impaired by 
successive arrests in which people were caught red-handed, the 
Nigerian connnection is reportedly using people who do not look 
so suspicious to carry the drug. Antonio Omar Sanchez was sent 
to the federal police and indicted for being caught red-handed 
in a crime.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 12 Mar (DPA) -- Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today confirmed the 
surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola, a leader of the Cali cocaine 
cartel, in Palmira, a city in western Colombia. 
  Prosecutor General De Greiff told the privately owned 
"Caracol" radio station in Santa Fe de Bogota that 27-year-old 
Urdinola is charged with drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, 
and conspiracy. 
  De Greiff said Urdinola was accompanied by one person, not 
two as was reported earlier. The prosecutor general said he did 
not know who Urdinola's companion was. 
  The prosecutor general added that Urdinola's lawyer said 
that 
the mafioso will confess to his crimes. De Greiff did not say 
where Urdinola is being held, but it is believed that he is at 
the Palmira maximum security prison. 
  The prosecutor general said he has no information regarding 
the imminent surrender of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged 
head of the Cali cartel, whose lawyers have been discussing his 
surrender with judicial authorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz by </F>
unidentified Caracol announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota on 12 
March--live] 
  [Text] Announcer: What is the government's 
position on the surrender of Valle del Cauca drug traffickers, 
which began today with the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola 
Grajales? 
  Gonzalez: I think this is an important event in 
the fight against drug trafficking and a positive event in the 
struggle against crime. It conveys the idea that criminals are 
better off surrendering to justice rather than succumbing to the 
state's firm actions. To the extent that this process advances 
within the framework of effective cooperation so justice can be 
done, we believe it will help strengthen the country's judicial 
organization. 
  Announcer: Is the government certain that drug 
traffickers who surrender will confess their crimes and 
cooperate with justice? 
  Gonzalez: According to reports from the 
Prosecutor General's Office, we understand there is a 
willingness on the part of drug traffickers to cooperate with 
authorities and confess their crimes. Obviously, this will have 
to be evaluated and judged by the Prosecutor General's Office 
and judicial authorities. However, we do have reports on the 
drug traffickers' willingness to cooperate. They surrendered to 
authorities unconditionally. Let's wait for an evaluation from 
the Prosecutor General's Office and for the process to conclude. 
  Announcer: Is the Palmira Prison a maximum 
security prison? Does it guarantee that these people will be 
safe there? 
  Gonzalez: Once we received the information from 
the Prosecutor General's Office on the surrender of these 
individuals, we set aside a place within Palmira Prison and took 
special security measures. They will be submitted to an ordinary 
disciplinary regime, as well as to special security measures. 
  Once the projects for a security section within Palmira 
Prison are complete, they will be transferred to those 
installations. 
  Announcer: Does the government know anything about 
other people surrendering? 
  Gonzalez: No. There are no reports of other drug 
traffickers surrendering to justice. As the public knows, this 
surrender is part of a process of conversations and requests 
that has been under way for several months now under the 
direction of the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  Announcer: We thank Justice Minister Andres 
Gonzalez Diaz. He just gave the government's official position 
on the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales.

<F P=106> [Report by Sonia Rodriguez from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the surrender today of Julio Fabio 
Urdinola Grajales, a man described by Colombian and U.S. 
intelligence corps as a prominent figure in the Cali Cartel, 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said it did not involve any 
concessions or special negotiations. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] [Word indistinct] this man's 
surrender. He came forth and said he surrendered. The Attorney 
General's Office participated in this process, which is 
appropriate and in accordance with the law. Urdinola said he 
wanted to surrender, and the processes involved in the 
Prosecutor General's charges against him will continue. In his 
confession, Urdinola said he will calmly and seriously follow 
legal procedures without anything unusual, as it must be in a 
civilized society. [end recording] 
  Urdinola Grajales is facing three charges within the 
Colombian legal system. Prosecutor de Greiff explained: 
  [Begin recording] 
  De Greiff: Drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, 
and conspiracy. 
  Rodriguez: With the surrender of Urdinola 
Grajales, do you expect Cali Cartel members to surrender en 
masse? Who is Jesus Ancizar Porras, who also surrendered today? 
  De Greiff: I have no idea. Nor do I have any idea 
if Mr. Urdinola belongs to a cartel. That is part of the 
investigation. General Octavio Vargas, director of the National 
Police, told me that Mr. Urdinola was accompanied by a man named 
Jesus Ancizar Porras. My office has no information regarding 
the latter's activities; that is, illegal activities. The 
prosecutor handling the case may provide you with more 
information, but with the restraint the case warrants. 
  Rodriguez: Recently there have been many 
contradictory views about the way you are implementing the 
surrender policy [five-second break in reception] how do you 
feel about it? 
  De Greiff: The country must remember that I do not 
have sovereign power to implement those provisions because they 
are dictated by law. The accord was approved by judges and the 
National Court. 
  Rodriguez: Do you know if the government assured 
Urdinola he will remain in Palmira Prison? 
  De Greiff: As far as I know--of course this has 
just happened--there was no agreement or conditions for the 
surrender of those men. 
  Rodriguez: Do you think this surrender will end 
the opposing views that have been expressed recently in the 
government? 
  De Greiff: I think we must set aside the hysteria 
of this past week on differences between the government and the 
Prosecutor General's Office and continue ahead with a policy 
that can--and I stress can--be successful. 
  Rodriguez: Why do you think the government is not 
allowing Pablo Escobar's five bodyguards to be moved to Itagui 
Prison? 
  De Greiff: What do I think about it? I do not 
think the problem of guarding 25, 25 [repeats] criminals or less 
is something that cannot be controlled and solved. We would be 
extremely inefficient [words indistinct] if we could not control 
25 criminals. [end recording] 
  Regarding the counts of drug trafficking, illegal 
enrichment, 
and conspiracy Urdinola is facing, I must tell you that a few 
days ago the U.S. Justice Department forwarded evidence against 
Urdinola and (Hernado Angel Garnet) to the Deputy Prosecutor's 
Office.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F>
Arrieta by "NTC News" anchorman Felix de Bedout--live] 
  [Text] de Bedout: For the past few weeks it has 
been obvious that you, the government, and the prosecutor 
general have grown apart. A few hours ago you said that the way 
this process has been handled could lead to impunity. Do you 
feel the same way after today's surrender? 
  Arrieta: I think a couple of things need to be 
cleared up. There have been differences, which the people heard 
about. I have questioned some decisions because I think these 
matters must be handled within a process, respecting the rights 
and duties of each entity. I do not believe the government, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, or the Attorney General's Office 
have grown apart. We have had our differences. I think that 
what happened today is the best proof that if we cooperate with 
one another, as we did in [Julio Fabio] Urdinola's case, this 
process can work. The truth is that Urdinola's surrender was an 
announced surrender. For quite some time now there has been 
talk of a surrender. I do not think there are any differences 
between the government, the prosecutor general, and the attorney 
general on this. 
  de Bedout: But the problem of impunity continues. 
Do you think the way things are being handled could result in 
impunity? 
  Arrieta: I have said repeatedly that because our 
Penal Code is a confusing, profuse, and diffuse code, it could 
lead to impunity. I have also said that the best way to prevent 
this is for all the institutions that must work with the law to 
agree on how we should make it work. In other words, the 
prosecutor general would do his job, the government its job, and 
the attorney general would orchestrate the whole procedure and 
see that no one goes unpunished. If we can achieve this, even 
though the Penal Code is confusing, profuse, and diffuse, I 
think we can give the country a balanced and appropriate answer. 
  de Bedout: Attorney General Arrieta, one subject 
that led to differences between the government and the 
prosecutor general was the transfer of certain Medellin Cartel 
members to a jail in Medellin. Do you think that transfer 
should be made? 
  Arrieta: I cannot express my opinion on that 
matter. Depending on what happens, the Attorney General's Office 
may have to become involved in this matter, and if I expressed 
my opinion now, I would have to declare myself ineligible to 
rule on this matter. I would like to say that the law is clear. 
The law clearly establishes the duties of the prosecutor 
general and the government, and we are responsible for ensuring 
that none of the two institutions oversteps its authority in 
order to ensure that the law is respected, not just in this 
particular case but in all cases that are controlled and 
supervised by the Attorney General's Office. 
  de Bedout: Thank you, Attorney General Arrieta.

  [Text] The Colombian Government welcomed gladly today the 
report that two additional alleged Valle del Cauca drug 
traffickers had surrendered. They are Julio Fabio Urdinola 
Grajales, brother of Ivan Urdinola Grajales, and Jesus Ancizar 
Porras, who were interned at Palmira Prison, Valle del Cauca 
Department, where they will negotiate their penalties with the 
Prosecutor General's Office. 
  Urdinola Grajales arrived with his defense counsels and 
immediately was received by Regional Prosecutor Francisco Javier 
Hernandez and Palmira Prison Director Marco Antonio de Moya. 
During the legal proceedings after undergoing a medical 
checkup, Urdinola Grajales confessed to his participation in 
drug-trafficking activities. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Unidentified reporter: Will the police or Army be 
in charge of security? 
  Captain Raul Benavides, Valle del Cauca police 
commander: It is the prison director's duty; we will back 
him up, however. [end recording] 
  Ancizar Porras arrived with Urdinola Grajales and confessed 
to his participation in crimes related to manslaughter. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz: This is an 
important and interesting event in the country's struggle 
against drug trafficking and organized crime; in addition, it 
underlines the fact it is more intelligent to surrender to the 
authorities than to perish as the result of the state's 
unceasing and determined actions. 
  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff: This is the 
result of a process in which the administration of justice, the 
government, and the police have cooperated. All of this has led 
to this surrender, and I hope it will also lead to other 
surrenders. [end recording] 
  Both Urdinola Grajales and Ancizar Porras will be held at 
Palmira Prison, where they will negotiate with the Prosecutor 
General's Office a quick end to the process they initiated with 
their surrender today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta </F>
by unidentified EL TIEMPO correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] Unidentified correspondent: A month ago, 
you told this newspaper that the Attorney General's Office was 
not satisfied with the process [of drug traffickers' 
surrendering to justice] and also that you would withdraw from 
the process if your suggestions were not heeded. Do you continue 
to think this way? Why? 
  Arrieta: I did not say I was dissatisfied with the 
process. Quite the contrary, I said it should be carried out 
but within certain legal and political parameters. One of them 
is, necessarily, the existence of a confession. Fortunately, 
this is what has happened and today, the Attorney General's 
Office, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic, 
and the government of the Republic fully agree on this point, 
which has also been accepted by those who are to surrender. 
  Regarding the second point, the Attorney General's Office 
cannot withdraw from the process because its participation is 
determined by the law. However, we are thinking about the 
possibility of having somebody who is not the attorney general 
-- the deputy attorney general -- attend the preparatory 
meetings because it is not desirable to deplete our reserves in 
this type of situation. 
  Correspondent: The government hinted that the 
prosecutor general is being naive in this process and that the 
traffickers are trying to take advantage of this situation. Do 
you think this is so? 
  Arrieta: I don't think the prosecutor is acting 
naively. I believe he has taken an eminently juridical position 
as corresponds to an organization that is part of the Judicial 
Branch. In this context, it is inevitable that the drug 
traffickers, who have excellent legal advisers, try to obtain 
all the benefits and take advantage of the loopholes and 
confusion in a criminal law that is confusing, profuse, and 
wordy. Confronted with such a situation, we all have the 
responsibility of trying to avoid abuses to or the improper use 
of the law. 
  The government has vast experience on this issue. The 
experience is based both on the accomplishments and the failures 
of the surrender policy. Furthermore, it handles, as 
corresponds to a government, a political dimension that causes 
it to be extremely cautious and sometimes biased. 
  That is why it is necessary for us, without being naive or 
radical, to join our knowledge and experiences. In other words, 
let us forget the "La Catedral syndrome." We have to learn from 
the past and move forward with responsibility and without fear. 
  Correspondent: You also told EL TIEMPO a month ago 
that the drug traffickers had made no concrete offer. Does this 
still hold true? What exactly has Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela 
offered? 
  Arrieta: It is important that the country's 
expectations regarding this process be lowered. A few months 
ago we were told there would be massive surrenders and that drug 
exports would be eradicated. This, naturally, generated great 
hope, both for the public as well as for the government. 
Unfortunately, the Cali gentlemen changed their position and 
today only talk about the possible surrender of two persons, one 
of them relatively minor but the other one, Gilberto Rodriguez, 
of great importance because of his hierarchy in the so-called 
Cali Cartel. There is no longer talk about the eradication of 
drug trafficking but rather of a possible cooperation that could 
lead to new surrenders or to the gradual reduction of illegal 
activities. All this is important, naturally, but does not have 
the political or juridical relevance that the original offer 
had. That is why we should no longer talk about the Cali 
Cartel's surrender, but about the possible surrender of Gilberto 
Rodriguez. That is why I believe we have to lower expectations. 
  Correspondent: The discrepancies between the 
prosecutor general and the government are obvious. What is 
behind their positions? Will this situation obstruct the 
process? 
  Arrieta: Discrepancies of form and substance 
between the three institutions involved are inevitable in a 
process such as this because the persons in charge of the 
government, the Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's 
Office are autonomous and willful and sometimes they have 
different opinions about what best suits the country. What is 
important is that we, as responsible and sensible people, do 
everything possible to reconcile our positions and to work 
harmoniously because this is what suits Colombia. If this is 
not produced, then each one will have to perform his legal and 
constitutional functions according to his beliefs of what is 
best. 
  Correspondent: The North Americans have demanded a 
common position and this does not exist. What will happen to 
the supplying of evidence? What will happen if they withdraw 
from the process? There is the impression that they are 
pressuring for "hardline" solutions and that they prefer 
captures to surrenders because they do not like the penalties 
(too light) that would be imposed in the case of surrenders. 
What can you tell us about this? 
  Arrieta: Unfortunately, a tense atmosphere in the 
field of legal cooperation has emerged and we have to overcome 
it because U.S. cooperation is of fundamental importance. But, 
regardless of how important this cooperation might be, it cannot 
be the soul of our policies nor can we depend entirely on it 
because legal cooperation cannot replace the efforts that must 
be made by our police, which are the ones that together with the 
Prosecutor General's Office, must gather the necessary evidence 
to prosecute drug traffickers. 
  About the North Americans preferring capture to surrender, I 
believe this is something all Colombians prefer also. However, 
if there is no capture, then the second best alternative would 
be the surrender. 
  Correspondent: What has been the position of the 
Attorney General's Office on the issues of confessions, 
indulgence because of collaboration, and house arrests? 
  Arrieta: My office has always maintained that 
confessions must be a necessary requirement, and not just any 
confession but solid, serious, and complete confessions in which 
the people and the court authorities may believe and as a basis 
for which sentences can be applied so that they do not engender 
impunity or demoralize the people. We have also insisted that 
collaboration must be significant, specific, and perceptible; 
that there must be a substantial delivery of assets; and that 
house arrests would apply only in exceptional cases, in minor 
cases. 
  Correspondent: It is evident that while the 
prosecutor general wants the process to move on quickly, the 
government wants to include elements that take into 
consideration national and international interests that would 
make the process move slower. How do you think the process 
should go? 
  Arrieta: This process has legal and political 
aspects, speaking in the broadest sense. One should not rush 
because we have learned from experience that if things are 
rushed, then errors are made. I also believe, though, that we 
all want the process to move as quickly as reasonably possible. 
I think that the Prosecutor General's Office now understands 
the government's concern and that the government now understands 
the problems of the prosecutor, and all of us know now that this 
process can move forward only if an interinstitutional effort is 
made and there is teamwork. 
  Correspondent: The role of mediator between the 
government and the Prosecutor General's Office has caused an 
ambivalent situation, in which the government accuses you of 
being the unconditional ally of the prosecutor. In addition, 
the Prosecutor General's Office argues that your stand is a 
reflection of that of the government. Where do you stand on 
this? 
  Arrieta: Yes, that is all true, and if the 
Attorney General's Office has tried to mediate, it is not only 
because we believe that position is one of our duties, but 
because we also believe public skirmishes weaken institutions 
and undermine the credibility and the trust people have in those 
institutions. We must not forget that only criminals fish in 
these troubled waters. 
  Correspondent: Regarding the surrender of the 
three presumed Cali Cartel members in January, is your 
prediction coming true that the ambiguity of some articles of 
the new Penal Code might create conditions that favor impunity 
in some particular cases? 
  Arrieta: I believe so because many of the articles 
were poorly drafted; have a confusing content and scope, and 
lend themselves to many interpretations. For the sake of 
preventing impunity, it is necessary that we wed our 
capabilities and efforts, act in a coordinated manner, and have 
the ability to stop any goals they will undoubtedly try to 
score. But, above all, criminals can only be sentenced when 
proof is available. 
  Correspondent: Related to the current controversy, 
what do you think about the remarks by the justice minister on 
the Prosecutor General's Office interpretation of Article 369E's 
scope. 
  Arrieta: The Attorney General's Office respects, 
but does not completely agree with the justice minister's 
interpretation of Article 369E, nor with the implementation the 
prosecutor has given it by opening a formal investigation on 
these proceedings. It is obvious, at least to us, that Article 
369E is related to the preceding articles that concern the 
granting of benefits. We believe that for Article 369E to be 
applicable, those who surrender must confess or collaborate, 
either in the proceedings pending against them or in new ones 
that are begun as a result of the surrender.

  [Text] Amid the controversy stirred up by the news about 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff meeting with three alleged 
drug traffickers from the so-called Cali Cartel, another 
confusing episode involving that organization was revealed last 
week by the news program "Noticiero QAP" and the newspaper EL 
ESPECTADOR. 
  According to those news sources, the Prosecutor General's 
Office served as a middleman to facilitate peace talks between 
the Cali Cartel and what is left of the Medellin Cartel, whose 
members are reportedly seeking to put an end to the war they 
have been waging for several years. 
  According to "QAP" and EL ESPECTADOR, on Wednesday, 16 
February, a meeting that was initially scheduled as a 
continuation of questioning turned into a friendly encounter 
between Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, "El Arete" [earring], 
Carlos Aguilar Gallego, "El Mugre" [grime], their attorneys, and 
Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo, apparently a liaison with the 
Cali Cartel. The meeting was reportedly held at the office of 
Cruz Helena Aguilar Echeverry, chief of the Drug Trafficking 
Unit of the Regional Prosecutors Office. 
  Although there has been speculation recently about a 
rapprochement between the members of the two cartels, especially 
since the death of Pablo Escobar, this is the first time anyone 
has heard of a formal meeting between arrested members of the 
Medellin Cartel and an emissary from the Cali Cartel in the 
presence of a judicial authority. 
  On orders from Prosecutor Aguilar, the two arrested men were 
transferred from La Picota to the Regional Prosecutors Office to 
participate in the continuation of questioning. "El Arete" and 
"El Mugre" and their attorneys arrived at Aguilar's office after 
0915. Aguilar took them right in, declining to use the special 
cubicles that are used to ensure that the declarants do not 
recognize their interrogators. Instead, she took them into the 
conference room next door to her office. 
  While the prosecutor, the arrestees, and their attorneys 
were 
speaking informally, Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo appeared. "El 
Arete" and "El Mugre" recognized him and told him of their 
concern about the war they have been waging against members of 
the Cali Cartel, and their desire to reach peace between the two 
sides. "This war has screwed us all," one of the arrestees said. 
  What was originally scheduled as an official appearance for 
questioning ended up being "a veritable orgy," in the words of 
EL ESPECTADOR. Indeed, at about 1445, "El Arete" sent out for 40 
boxes of chicken and 40 soft drinks for those who were present 
at the questioning as well as the security personnel. By the end 
of the afternoon, Angel Restrepo left the office having pledged 
to travel to Cali and seek a real rapprochement between the two 
sides. 
  The arrestees reportedly told Prosecutor Aguilar that they 
were worried about the charges against them and reiterated their 
willingness to cooperate with the authorities. 
  This news also surprised the prosecutor general. Although at 
first he denied that members of the two cartels had met in the 
presence of one of his subordinates, he ended up admitting that 
the prosecutor knew "El Mugre" from before, because they had 
gone to grade school together. He stated, however, that this 
would not prevent her from carrying out her judicial duties. 
  De Greiff termed the first reports by the media "monstrous," 
but he warned that the Prosecutor General's Office cannot allow 
itself to be used for this kind of activity, which seriously 
tarnishes the institution's image. He also explained that an 
entity with primarily judicial functions cannot be used as an 
intermediary between criminal organizations. 
  Aside from the anecdotes emerging from the meeting, the 
greatest concern is that some of what little evidence has been 
gathered against the two cartels is based on information 
provided by the Cali people against the Medellin people and vice 
versa. Therefore, an agreement between these two groups could 
turn into a mutual pact of silence, to the obvious detriment of 
the investigations.

<F P=106> [Report from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Two documents that were made public today, the 
prosecutor general's letter to the U.S. attorney general and the 
justice minister's letter to the prosecutor general, demonstrate 
that the same virtues that made Gustavo de Greiff stand out as 
the man of the year are now causing him difficulties. 
  Signed by his own hand, the prosecutor's letter tells the 
U.S. attorney general that unless the United States presents 
evidence, the war against drug trafficking will be lost; 
evidence is needed to condemn people in both countries; drug 
legalization is good provided it destroys the source of funds 
for drug traffickers; and consumer countries have no policies to 
halt consumption. 
  These are four obvious truths, which nevertheless, offend 
the 
U.S. attorney general. The prosecutor is condemned for the 
virtue of speaking the truth without beating around the bush, 
which gained him admiration in Colombia. Something similar has 
happened to the government. The prosecutor has implemented 
surrender to justice policies, but the government changed the 
rules to avoid a repetition of the La Catedral Jail mistakes, 
when Escobar confessed what he wanted to. Now the confession 
must be accurate, sincere, and truthful. 
  At that time, Escobar purchased, built, and outfitted the 
prison to his needs; now imprisonment must be in high security 
jails and subject to special disciplinary regulations. The 
government wants to show the United States that it will not 
repeat past mistakes. The prosecutor only ensures law 
enforcement, as he has always done, to the admiration of the 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Today, the Attorney General's Office insisted on 
relocating five Medellin Cartel members from Santa Fe de Bogota 
to Itagui. The government, however, through Justice Minister 
Andres Gonzalez, continues to resist this transfer. Today, the 
Attorney General's Office said its Medellin representative 
requested the transfer of the five people charged with being 
lieutenants of the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar Gaviria. 
  A communique issued today by the Attorney General's Office 
states that, based on Article 35 of the Penal Procedures Code, 
the Medellin Cartel members must be accessible to the prosecutor 
in charge of their case, thereby allowing preliminary meetings 
and agreements. The government thinks differently however. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] Regarding their transfer, I have 
stated that, in our opinion, it is not advisable to gather the 
remaining Medellin Cartel members in the same place. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala and Raul Gutierrez from the "24 </F>
Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff continues to 
live in the eye of the hurricane. A special Security Council 
session -- a session attended by the president as well as the 
government, justice, and defense ministers, among others -- 
decided not to authorize Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff's 
request to transfer Medellin Cartel prisoners to their native 
city. Here is a report by Alvaro Ayala: 
  [Begin recording] 
  Ayala: The prosecutor general today said he will 
not resign, adding that he will study the National Security 
Council decision to block the transfer to Itagui of members of 
the Medellin Cartel currently held at the La Picota and Modelo 
jails in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  De Greiff: The Prosecutor General's Office will 
study the decision with due respect to the Security Council's 
opinions and recommendations, and it will adopt appropriate 
measures in a timely manner. 
  Unidentified reporter: Can the fact that Medellin 
Cartel prisoners will not be transferred to the jail in Itagui 
be seen as weakness on the part of the government? 
  De Greiff: No, I cannot make any additional 
comments other than those I have just made. 
  Reporter: The attorney of [Cali Cartel members] 
Gilberto Rodriguez and Julio Fabio Ordinola just said that they 
will surrender if you guarantee that they will be held at a 
Valle del Cauca Department jail. Can you guarantee such a thing? 
  De Greiff: I will also have to study this. I 
cannot say any more. 
  Reporter: [words indistinct] 
  De Greiff: No, I cannot say anything else. 
  Reporter: Just one more question. There is the 
impression that the executive branch is not heeding your orders. 
  De Greiff: Let each person judge this for himself 
according to his conscience and heart. 
  Reporter: If the Cali Cartel members surrender, 
will you continue to work for the process of submission to 
justice by drug traffickers? 
  De Greiff: I obviously have to accept it because 
this is what is established by Colombian law. [end recording] 
  The following are details of the Security Council communique 
that refused to authorize the prosecutor general's request. The 
communique stated that the government clearly disagrees with 
Gustavo de Greiff and that it has information concerning the 
reunification of the Medellin Cartel. Here is a report by Raul 
Gutierrez: 
  [Begin recording] 
  Gutierrez: The Security and Defense Council 
issued a severe warning to the prosecutor general for insisting 
on the transfer of Carlos Alzate, a.k.a. Arete; Carlos Aguilar, 
a.k.a. Mugre; Gustavo Gutierrez, a.k.a. Maxwell; Jose Fernando 
Posada; and Jorge Pizano from La Picota jail in Santa Fe de 
Bogota to the jail in Itagui, near Medellin. After meeting 
under the leadership of President Gaviria, the council 
recommended that the transfer not be carried out. It also 
expressed its serious disagreement with De Greiff for having 
stated that the Medellin Cartel prisoners do not intend to 
resume their criminal activities. 
  Government Minister Fabio Villegas: Information 
available to the Higher Council of National Security and Defense 
permits us to state that they [Medellin Cartel prisoners] not 
only have the means to reunify, but also that their intentions 
appear to be leaning toward reunifying their criminal 
organizations, even uniting with the Valle cartels with which 
they have had contacts within the past few days. 
  Gutierrez: The council gave its full support to 
the justice minister and the director of the Penitentiary and 
Prison Institute, thereby enabling them to maintain the state of 
emergency in the prisons and keep organized crime chiefs 
dispersed in various prisons. 
  Villegas: This was done because we believe the 
transfer would represent a grave danger to public order, prison 
security, the security of Medellin, and the nation's security, 
and it also would provide a means for the last remnants of the 
Medellin Cartel to reunify. 
  Gutierrez: To prevent anything from being left 
out, the Higher Security and Defense Council recommended to the 
justice minister that he ask the prosecutor general to change 
the venue of the legal processes against the five members of the 
Medellin Cartel. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to intelligence reports, Medellin Cartel 
prisoners might be in contact with the Valle del Cauca cartels 
in a bid to unite. Some experts are asking why the prosecutor 
general was not given these intelligence reports before the 
communique was issued by the Higher Council of National Security 
and Defense. Here is a report by Miriam Ortiz: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] The Security Council based its 
decision on intelligence reports to prohibit the transfer of 
some Medellin Cartel members to the maximum security section at 
the Itagui prison. According to authorities, Carlos Alzate 
Urquijo, a.k.a. Arete, is Roberto Escobar's successor. After 
the attempt on his life, Roberto Escobar, a.k.a. Osito, 
delegated to Arete all of the functions he inherited from his 
brother Pablo Escobar. Roberto Escobar did this because he felt 
that with Alzate's leadership qualities, his family ties, and 
the respect he commands among his cohorts, there was no one 
better than Alzate to recover lost ground, prevent front men 
from taking over their properties, and prevent the dominance of 
the Cali Cartel. 
  According to intelligence reports, Arete is followed in the 
hierarchy by Luis Carlos Aguilar Gallego, a.k.a. Mugre; Jose 
Fernando Posada, a.k.a. Jaime Eduardo; and Gustavo Adolfo Arrula 
[name as heard], a.k.a. Maxwell. 
  The intelligence reports add that there is proof of links 
between the Medellin Cartel and the guerrilla groups based in 
Antioquia Department, especially with the Urban Militias led by 
the ELN [Army of National Liberation]. According to a statement 
by Pipe Perez [not further identified], Alzate Urquijo was the 
direct contact between the cartel and guerrilla leaders. The 
state intelligence agencies also report that Otto [Ottoniel

<F P=106> [Report from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The prosecutor general's [Gustavo de Grieff] 
questionable situation moved into even deeper water this 
afternoon. When he was about to meet with Cali Cartel lawyers, 
he received a surprise visit by the DEA director in Colombia. 
  Attorney Bernardo Gonzalez, representative of Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela, and Attorney Juan Fernandez Carrasquilla, 
representative of Julio Fabio Ordinola Grajales, arrived this 
afternoon at the Prosecutor General's Office to confirm that 
their intentions to surrender remain firm. Although the slated 
meeting did not take place because de Grieff left hastily to 
meet with President Cesar Gaviria, the visit of the DEA director 
in Colombia caused surprise. Authorized Prosecutor General's 
Office spokesmen said it was regrettable that the U.S. 
Government, through the DEA, meddles in the surrender process. 
According to the attorneys, the Colombian Government has not 
allowed the surrender. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Fernandez: In our opinion, the delay is the 
government's fault. 
  Unidentified reporter: Why? 
  Fernandez: Because the government has not decided 
yet to guarantee the jail. Before any more steps are taken in 
the negotiations, the Justice Ministry must guarantee the 
Prosecutor General's Office that the inmates will not be moved 
from the place where they surrender. [end recording] 
  To conclude, the attorneys said that their clients' 
surrender 
will be done individually and not in the name of the drug cartel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party presidential candidate </F>
Andres Pastrana, 11 February, in Bogota, by Maria Teresa 
Ronderos and Jorge Gonzalez] 
  [Excerpts] Twelve hours after presenting his platform at a 
hectic and colorful session in the Convention Center, Andres 
Pastrana still seemed very animated. 
  Since 0600 on Friday he had been taking calls from radio 
stations and at the request of one of them, he exchanged 
greetings with Samper, responding with a "very good, my dear 
Ernesto," to a somewhat cool "well, how did it go?" 
  Then he met with journalists from EL TIEMPO in his apartment 
where, accompanied by Luis Alberto Moreno, his campaign 
coordinator, and Jaime Ruiz, his issues adviser, he was getting 
ready to begin his first campaign trip through Antioquia. 
[passage omitted] 
  EL TIEMPO: People recognize the effort you have 
made to be independent of your father. But there are some 
issues, like international policy, on which when you speak it 
seems as if Misael and not Andres were speaking.... 
  Pastrana: One thing needs to be understood: few 
times in political history has a former president seen that his 
son might reach the presidency. I imagine that would not be easy 
to deal with. At least not for a man with the character and 
temperament of Misael Pastrana, a person who likes to express 
his opinions, who fights openly for his party and for his ideas. 
  On international policy, we have a very important group of 
people who are truly knowledgeable about these issues. If there 
is one thing on which I agree with my father, it is that 
international policy should not be handled in isolation by one 
party. 
  EL TIEMPO: But in this area some of your father's 
proposals belong more to a nationalism of a bygone era. 
  Pastrana: Are we perhaps talking about the 
marines? Fine, we can do that. If there really are 
troop movements, the president has to make the issues clear. The 
government has said that it failed to provide information. It is 
still possible to convene the Advisory Commission on Relations 
to help clear up unknown factors. 
  Since I am on this issue, here is another difference between 
myself and Samper. During my government I will bring in foreign 
advisers to help coordinate the campaign against narcoterrorism. 
He said he would not do that; he does not know that we need 
strong methods to fight this scourge. 
  In this field, I have developed my own policy, my own 
contacts. I chaired an organization of 16 Latin American 
parties. I have ties of friendship with President Caldera and 
his family, and also with President Frei of Chile. I am a friend 
and I went to school with President Figueres of Costa Rica. We 
have excellent relations with President Cristiani. I also have 
excellent contacts in Europe. That will allow us to consolidate 
the integration process, going beyond international treaties. We 
have already promoted our own course of action, which is very 
much my own. [passage omitted] 
  EL TIEMPO: Now that Escobar and the myth of the 
Medellin Cartel are dead, what would you do about the Cali 
Cartel? 
  Pastrana: I have been quite clear about the need 
to curb the drug traffic and not to legalize the production, 
sale, and consumption of drugs. We are going to revise our 
antidrug strategies to make them more effective. I have not been 
informed about the negotiations with the Cali Cartel. I support 
them as long as they are in compliance with the law and the 
policy of bringing criminals to justice. I do not accept and 
will not accept the policy of house arrest. That is ridiculous; 
it would be shameful. What is needed is severe punishment, not a 
reward. 
  EL TIEMPO: The possibility that drug traffickers 
may end up with ridiculously small penalties is of great concern 
to the United States. They demand that the punishment be 
proportional to the crime. Do you think that fear is reasonable? 
  Pastrana: Why do they not apply that approach in 
their country? Carlos Lehder was sentenced to life in prison 
plus 100 years. Now, according to what we have heard, he was 
transferred to a German jail and given special privileges after 
negotiations. When I was in Washington in 1990 I proposed that 
we pursue a policy similar to plea bargaining; the 
press jumped all over me and asked me why I was suggesting such 
an idea. "Why are you so upset? That is your system, we are 
going to copy it," I answered. And we have copied it, to such an 
extent that the first legislation was issued by decree. What was 
wrong with that? That we might negotiate in search of peace? But 
when the drug lords sought through extradition went [to the 
United States] and got the "perks" of plea bargaining 
by turning in other people, that was not criticized. 
  I agree that we need to seek a fair sentence from the legal 
point of view. I insist that penalties must be served in prison. 
The policy of bringing criminals to justice must be consistent. 
  EL TIEMPO: You have announced that you will not 
accept campaign contributions from the Santo Domingo Group. Does 
this mean your government would pursue an energetic policy of 
controlling concentrations of wealth? 
  Pastrana: As they should be, my campaign books are 
open to anyone who wants to see them in the Treasury Inspector's 
Office. A policy needs to be developed to protect citizens from 
abuses by private and public enterprises that take advantage of 
their dominant position. Another very important issue is 
regulating lobbying and political campaign financing. 
  The regulation of the monopoly system concerns me, 
especially 
as it relates to the Television Law. I believe we have been lax 
because the government has run the television system. If we want 
to protect the citizens' right to be well informed, we can not 
continue to be so lax. Furthermore, regional autonomy will not 
become a reality without excellent territorial legislation. We 
need to strengthen and pay attention to the commission created 
by the 1991 Charter. The truth is that the bill now pending in 
Congress is very weak.

  [Text] A prosecutor obtains an arrest warrant against a 
mayor upon finding a 15,000-peso discrepancy in an account, and 
another charges a widow with homicide solely because she did not 
attend her husband's funeral. 
  A special prosecutor demands money from the potential 
targets 
of his investigation, and others do not attend court proceedings 
and later allow court orders to be falsified. 
  Investigations and arrests are overturned because of 
inconsistencies, as in Adelina Mesa's case, who was accused of a 
terrorist attack in Bogota, and prosecutors are blamed for 
inconsistencies in a number of cases. 
  All these episodes seem to have finally exhausted the 
patience of Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. His staff 
is now handling 1,200 investigations of prosecutors. In a letter 
to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, he revealed the 
system's Achilles heel: arbitrary actions and negligence on the 
part of a number of prosecutors. 
  Arrieta issued a forceful criticism: some prosecutors 
initiate legal action hastily and without solid evidence, 
thereby violating the principle of [presumed] innocence and due 
process. 
  In his letter, the attorney general announced the immediate 
start of new investigations because these abuses still persist, 
even though in May 1993 he had issued warnings concerning these 
abuses, also in a letter to the prosecutor general. 
  De Greiff agrees that there are serious irregularities in 
the 
work of some of his subordinates, but says they do not reach the 
extreme cited by the Attorney General's Office. 
  "We," De Greiff told EL TIEMPO, "do not conceal anything 
from 
a sense of esprit de corps; we do not protect people because 
they are in the Prosecutor General's Office. We are not saints, 
but we try to be." 
  During his 18 months at the Prosecutor General's Office, De 
Greiff has investigated 656 prosecutors in internal procedures. 
To date 238 investigations have been concluded; 418 are still 
under way. 
<H5>  Director of Prosecution Offices </H5>
  The National Director of Prosecution Offices, Ana Montes, 
who 
coordinates prosecutors all over the country and whose office 
maintains statistics on decisions issued by prosecutors acting 
as trial judges, has her own view of the matter. 
  Montes agrees that "it is time to look at what is going on," 
but she explains that many of the complaints are filed when the 
party affected by a decision calls for a disciplinary or penal 
investigation against the prosecutor. 
  Still, the Attorney General's Office believes that the 
problem goes far beyond that. As an example, they say that 
prosecutors have been initiating legal proceedings against 
municipal officials who in the end prove their innocence. 
  "On many occasions ignorance of administrative contracting 
provisions and regulations or of budget systems has caused legal 
action to be initiated and municipal officials to be suspended 
who later (...) must be returned to office." 
  "All this," explains the attorney general, "could be avoided 
if prosecutors studied the situation thoroughly before 
initiating legal proceedings." 
  However, De Greiff and Arrieta both seem to agree that the 
time has come to apply a firm hand.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The defense minister and the Colombian Air Force 
commander have decided to provide an explanation concerning the 
decision to shoot down airplanes which violate Colombian 
airspace. 
  Let us investigate when an airplane may be shot down and 
what 
attitude Air Force pilots must assume, according to the Aviation 
Routes and Procedures Manual. 
  The procedure begins once the airplane is detected by any 
one 
of four military radars located at San Andres, Guajira, 
Araracuara, or Leticia. Normally these planes are tracked from 
the United States by U.S. AWACS airplanes, which later give the 
information to the Colombian radar stations. Then, this signal, 
which is simultaneously received at the National Defense 
Military Headquarters in Bogota, is analyzed. This is where 
they verify if the airplane is legally in transit. If this is 
not the case, they order the closest air base to send A-37, 
Kfir, Mirage, OB-10, or Tucano fighter planes to intercept it. 
  When radio communication is not possible, the intercepting 
aircraft must use the following visual signals: First, move from 
side to side and turn its navigation lights on and off to warn 
the airplane it has been intercepted. Second, abruptly move away 
from the intercepted airplane, making a 90-degree turn upwards 
to tell it to continue. Third, lower the landing gear leaving 
the landing lights on. Then raise the landing gear to notify 
the airplane it must land. Fourth, repeatedly turn all lights on 
and off. If the airplane does not respond it is shot down 
immediately. 
  This norm will be enforced in approximately 45 days, after 
the Civil Aeronautics Board notifies all airplane companies. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Ortiz: General [Alfonso Abondano, Commander of the 
Colombian Air Force], how can you guarantee the safety of the 
pilots who will combat these drug traffickers, taking into 
account that most of the pilots working for drug traffickers 
have worked for the Air Force or have been Air Force pilots? 
  Abondano: We locate the airplanes through the Air 
Defense's Military Center. Once intercepted, our pilots cannot 
say they do not have the airplane in sight. [end recording] 
  According to the defense minister this decision was adopted 
because approximately 600 clandestine airplanes fly over 
Colombian territory each year.

  [Text] Luis Hernando Correa Isaza, a key official in the 
surrender of several Medellin Cartel members to the authorities, 
was murdered by paid assassins in Calasanz neighborhood, 
northern Medellin, at approximately 1030 yesterday. Correa 
Isaza was the regional director of the Antioquia Prosecutor's 
Office technical corps. The assassins were traveling in a white 
Renault 9 and fled the scene after killing Correa Isaza. So 
far, authorities have been unable to locate the perpetrators. 
  Correa Isaza was traveling in a gray Renault 18 when several 
men attacked his car near a building at No. 82-24, 49B Street 
and shot him several times. The Antioquia Prosecutor's Office 
official was immediately taken to Pablo Tobon Uribe hospital in 
Medellin, where he died in the emergency room a few minutes 
later. Correa Isaza's driver was also seriously injured in the 
attack. Correa Isaza was reportedly going to look for his 
girlfriend when he was attacked. 
  Luis Fernando Correa, a 34-year-old lawyer who graduated 
from 
Medellin University, was a key government figure in obtaining 
the surrender of several criminals and implementing the witness 
protection program. He was widely known in legal circles for 
helping get Nicolas Escobar Urquijo, nephew of Medellin Cartel 
drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria, out of the country, and for 
helping transfer Escobar Gaviria's relatives to Santa Fe de 
Bogota. Moreover, Correa Isaza was conducting important 
investigations of people accused of belonging to the Medellin 
Cartel. 
  According to witnesses, Correa was shot by a young, stocky 
man dressed in blue who was picked up a few seconds later by a 
white Renault 9. It is therefore suspected that more people are 
involved in the crime. 
  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he regretted the 
incident and although the reason for the crime and the 
perpetrators are still unknown, Correa Isaza was involved in 
many delicate investigations that could have prompted the 
murder. The ranking judicial official said the regional 
director of Antioquia Prosecutor's Office technical corps was a 
brave man who took too many risks because, despite his delicate 
position, he liked to move about the city alone or only with his 
driver. 
  Ivan Felipe Palacios, secretary of the departmental 
government, said "one cannot understand how such things happen 
to people who are only honestly and positively working in favor 
of justice and the country." He asked the Prosecutor General's 
Office to begin immediately an investigation of the crime, 
because "we cannot progress without finding the real culprits." 
He asserted: I am going to be very conscious of everything 
related to this case because it is very painful for justice and 
for the people of Antioquia." 
  During one of Correa Isaza's latest operations, 70 kg of 
dynamite were seized from the estate of the father of late 
Medellin Cartel member Alfonso Leon Puerta Munoz, alias "El 
Angelito."

<F P=106> [Report by Basilio Quesada Chanto] </F>
  [Text] The Technical Customs Investigations Division (DITA) 
is investigating the suspicious importation of large quantities 
of isopropyl alcohol [alcohol hidropropilico] not only for 
possible fiscal irregularities but also for potential links to 
drug trafficking activities. 
  This chemical substance presumably can be used to process 
cocaine, "crack," and other drugs, thus DITA personnel suspect 
that a cocaine laboratory may be operating in the country. 
According to the police report, this type of alcohol, which was 
presumably shipped from El Salvador, cannot be used for medical 
or industrial (liquor production) purposes. Furthermore, it is 
described as a solvent on the list of suspected precursor 
chemicals. 
  DITA grew even more suspicious when Costa Rican authorities 
called the Salvadoran firm noted as the shipper on the customs 
entry document, and the firm said it does not distribute that 
type of product. 
  DITA will coordinate the case with the Government and Public 
Security Ministry's national drug control directorate as there 
is enough evidence to suggest that a cocaine laboratory is 
behind the importing firm. The latter is believed to be a ghost 
company as it does not have any physical location or personnel 
to handle the alcohol it has brought into the country. The 
company has imported more than 40,000 liters of isopropyl 
alcohol from October 1993 to date. The final destination of the 
chemical is unknown.

  [Text] A ship arriving in Haiti under a Honduran flag was 
inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard, which discovered about 100 kg 
of cocaine on board. They arrested the 15 members of the crew. 
The drug was discovered inside a container during the 
preliminary search at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba. The ship was due for a more thorough search on 6 March 
upon its landing in the Florida Everglades. Of the 15 people 
arrested, 12 are of Colombian nationality and the three others 
are from Peru. Their identities were not revealed. 
  Twelve kg of cocaine concealed in plastic containers was 
intercepted on 5 March at the international airport. The 
national anti-drug brigade proceeded to arrest the two 
smugglers, a U.S. citizen of Haitian origin and a Haitian woman 
named Joanne Francois. The drug seized at the airport is 
assessed at 12 kg. 
  Furthermore, a small boat carrying 50 bags of marijuana 
wrecked in Torbeck in the Port-Salut region and was discovered 
by the anti-drug brigade. However, the smuggler was concealed by 
the population that had seized the boat. Two men from Colombia, 
who were still aboard the boat, were arrested.

  [Text] The Government of Baja California is offering a 
reward to anyone who gives information on Ismael Higuera 
Guerrero, alias El Mayel, an heir of the Tijuana Cartel, which 
controls drug trafficking activities in the area. 
  Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel said that authorities are 
searching for Higuera Guerrero, a lieutenant of the Arellano 
Felix brothers, well-known drug trafficking bosses in the city 
of Tijuana, for his involvement in a shoot-out on 3 March in 
which four people were killed. The Baja California governor did 
not mention the amount of the reward, which will be discussed at 
the state's congress. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] said yesterday that the 
best U.S. and Mexican narcotics agents will be part of a special 
group to fight drug trafficking activities on the border between 
the countries, where tons of drugs circulate. 
  Ruffo pointed out that Higuera is a key element in the 
shoot-out that took place between federal and state agents in a 
Tijuana shopping center, which resulted in four persons being 
killed, including Alejandro Castaneda, chief of the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF]. Five agents were also injured in the 
incident. 
  According to the PGR, the shoot-out occurred when state 
agents and a Lebanese gunman were providing protection to Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, well-known drug trafficking boss from that 
border city. The PGR added that the incident took place when 
members of the State Judicial Police (PJE) were escorting Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, in a vehicle. 
  The PJF, which is investigating the activities of the 
Tijuana 
Cartel, initiated the pursuit of a vehicle in which El Mayel was 
allegedly traveling, which led the state judicial agents to 
shoot at the federal agents. 
  The Lebanese gunman, an unidentified man, Castaneda, and a 
PJE member who was protecting the alleged drug trafficker, were 
killed in the shoot-out. 
  The PGR said that the assistant state attorney general, 
Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the state prosecutor for special affairs 
were arrested by the federal authorities for their alleged 
responsibility in the incidents. According to the PGR, Ortiz 
ordered the federal agents to turn over to him one of the 
alleged drug traffickers, who was arrested following the 
shoot-out but was later released. 
  Even though Ortiz claims he is innocent, the PGR has 
denounced the involvement of certain state judicial police 
members with the drug traffickers, which could explain why the 
Arellano Felix brothers have not been arrested yet. Governor 
Ruffo Appel said he believes Ortiz is innocent because he says 
he has known him since childhood and he had no reason to get 
involved in drug trafficking activities.

<F P=106> [Report from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General's Office of the Republic [PGR] 
today remanded 16 people, including officials of the Baja 
California Attorney General's Office and suspected drug 
trafficker Higuera Guerrero. They are allegedly responsible for 
the shoot-out in Tijuana on Thursday [3 March] during which a 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] commander, his assistant, and 
three other people were killed. 
  Agents of the state judicial police in Baja California, who 
were protecting drug traffickers, were responsible for the 
shoot-out with members of the PJF in Tijuana. In the shoot-out, 
Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of 
the PJF in Tijuana; Salvador Miramontes Torres, agent of the 
state judicial police; (Rayad Abdul Shedar), a Lebanese-origin 
professional criminal working for drug traffickers; and an 
unidentified individual were killed and five people were wounded. 
  Regarding this incident, which occurred on 3 March at Felix 
Gomez Street and Diaz Ordaz Boulevard in La Mesa District in 
Tijuana, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, deputy attorney general for 
districts and subdistricts of the PGR, issued the results of the 
investigations. He said the participation of some members of the 
state judicial police in the shoot-out has been proven. The 
motive for the shoot-out was the fact that the state judicial 
policemen were protecting Isamel Higuera Guerrero, alias El 
Mayel, a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix brothers, when he was 
going to be arrested by the PJF. The state judicial policemen 
attacked the PJF members, and in the shoot-out drug trafficker 
Ismael Higuera Guerrero was able to escape. He has been 
identified as the individual who has inherited control of drug 
trafficking in Tijuana as a result of the search for the 
Arellano Felix brothers. 
  Eleven [number as heard] individuals identified as people at 
the service of the Baja California Attorney General's Office 
have been remanded. These include Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy 
state attorney general [subprocurador de justicia del estado] in 
Tijuana, and Juan Carlos Guerrero, agent of the Attorney 
General's Office for the court of equity [agente del ministerio 
publico del fuero comun]. They are accused of abuse of 
authority, aiding the mass escape of prisoners, and crimes 
against the administration of justice. They are both free as 
they filed amparos when they appeared to make their statements. 
Arrest warrants have been issued for five group leaders of the 
state judicial police and the operational commander of the 
Tijuana municipal police for the same crime [not further 
specified].

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores in Baja California State; from the </F>
"ACIR Radio News" newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Flores] At noon, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, 
attorney general for Baja California State, announced a total 
reorganization of the Baja California Judicial Police. This is 
what he said: 
  [Begin Rios recording] In 15 days, we will totally 
reorganize 
the state's Judicial Police. When I say totally, I mean the 
absolute and complete reorganization relating to the actions and 
conduct of Judicial Police members. [end recording] 
  At a news conference, the state attorney general said that 
bad policemen will be dismissed immediately, especially those 
who took part in Thursday's shoot-out, here in Tijuana, where 
Federal Judicial Police Commander Salvador Miramontes Torres 
died, federal policeman Juan Jesus Hernandez Tejeda was 
seriously wounded, and a state policeman was also killed. 
  Franco Rios reiterated that the investigation continues so 
as 
to supply the judge handling the case with the most evidence so 
he can best ascertain the responsibility of the policemen 
involved as well as the involvement of Tijuana Assistant 
Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara and the group leaders named 
by the Attorney General's Office. 
  The attorney general said that many of these policemen went 
to the scene of the shoot-out to do their duty but their names 
are listed in the case. He also said that on Monday two agents 
from the Attorney General's Office in Ensenada and Mexicali 
arrived here in Tijuana to continue the case and to clarify 
which agents are involved in drug trafficking. Finally, Deputy 
Alejandro Monraz called for the creation of a special 
Prosecutor's Office, with no connection with the state Attorney 
General's Office, to investigate Thursday night's shoot-out in 
La Mesa area, where four people were killed and eight, wounded. 
  Announcer: I asked you if this is in response to 
the Thursday shoot-out? 
  Flores: Yes, of course. The Attorney General's 
Office held a news conference on Sunday here in Tijuana. It was 
learned that there is a direct connection between the shoot-out 
and State Judicial Police. Many of them are at the state 
Attorney General's Office right now. No arrests warrants have 
been issued yet, even though many were detained. At least three 
group leaders are accused of being involved in the shoot-out, 
especially as bodyguards of a lieutenant working for the 
Arellano Felix brothers. They said they sold protection to the 
lieutenant.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores from Tijuana from the "ACIR Radio </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Baja California State Governor Ernesto Ruffo said 
today that the Attorney General's Office, PGR, report on the 3 
March shoot-out at the border is not in keeping with reality. 
He stressed that there are very strong interests behind the 
clashes. 
  Governor Ruffo said at a news conference in Mexicali, the 
state capital, that his administration will continue 
investigations even though the PGR has declared the case closed. 
  In Tijuana, Jorge Alvarez Barrieri, commander of the second 
sector of the State Judicial Police, said there are political 
motives behind the detentions and arrest warrants issued against 
members of the state judicial police as charges were fabricated 
against Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara and PGR Agent Juan 
Carlos Guerrero Cermeno, both of whom have been accused of 
releasing three suspects. 
  Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Human Rights 
Center, said the judicial agents who are under arrest and those 
whose arrests have been ordered are only scapegoats and the real 
culprits have not even been mentioned. Clark Alfaro has 
demanded an investigation of State Prosecutor Juan Franciso 
Franco Rios as nobody can lift a finger without Franco Rios' 
authorization. 
  The 3 March shoot-out left four people dead, including two 
members of the Federal Judicial Police and one member of the 
State Judicial Police. 
  Deputy Attorney General Alfonso Cabrera Morales held a news 
conference on 7 March and said State Judicial Police agents were 
responsible for the shoot-out as they were protecting Ismael 
Higuera Guerrero, an assistant of the Arellano Felix brothers.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Baltazar Jimenez, reporter for EL SOL </F>
DE CHILPANCINGO newspaper, in Chilpancingo, Guerrero State; from 
the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Announcer: We reported to you at the 
start of this cast that three Guerrero State public security 
policemen were gunned down by shotgun fire and six others are 
seriously wounded. They were ambushed in the pre-dawn hours 
today [as heard] by a dangerous gang of criminals who operate in 
the Xapotitlan, Tablas Municipality, located high up in the 
mountains, according to information supplied by Manuel Noreno 
Gonzalez, chief of Guerrero State public security. Good 
afternoon, Baltazar. 
  Jimenez: Good afternoon. 
  Announcer: Baltazar, what happened this morning? 
  Jimenez: According to a note by reporter Alfredo 
Guzman, several public security patrols were ambushed yesterday 
by excited villagers who were annoyed because several poppy 
plantations were destroyed. Three policemen were killed in the 
incident. Each received more than 15 shots in addition to the 
coup d'grace. The disturbances took place in the Atlixtlac 
Municipality. Alejandrino Campo Lezma, regional public security 
commander in Tlapa de Comonfort told the Prosecutor General's 
Office authorities that Saturday [as heard] night at about 0400, 
it was decided to carry out a patrol between the village of 
(Zaltizagua) and Oxtoepec, Atlixtlac Municipality. Campo said 
that two patrols made up of 10 men in one and seven in the 
other, began walking at night and on the way found several poppy 
plantations, which they destroyed. The commander said that the 
plantations measured 10 meters by 20 meters and they found one 
or two every kilometer. 
  In his statement it was established that it was about 2000 
on 
Saturday night when they heard several rifle shots and the 
policemen hid as best they could under trees. They ran until 
they reached Oxtoepec. There they made a head count and found 
that three were missing. They immediately spoke with the 
village police chief who promised to intercede with the alleged 
attackers to allow the policemen to look for their three 
companions who had disappeared in the shoot-out. 
  The commander stated that while speaking with the village 
police chief he saw several armed persons who arrived behind 
them and spoke in a dialect. After several minutes of 
negotiation, the armed persons allowed a search for the three 
missing public security policemen. The villagers in Oxtoepec 
allowed 10 policemen to enter, but only unarmed, to search for 
their companions. The bullet-riddled bodies were found at the 
clash site. The dead policemen were each missing their AR-15 
rifles and their three spare clips. 
  The searchers say that they found no less than 70 heavily 
armed persons who threatened to shoot and kill them. [Words 
indistinct] who moments before had negotiated their entry, so 
the policemen were not harmed. 
  Yesterday at about 1900 a telephone call was received at the 
Chipalcingo coroner's office, telling them to prepare to receive 
more bodies, because seemingly another clash had taken place, 
causing the death of several public security policemen in 
several villages near Axtlistac Municipality. Lastly, this was 
not confirmed. 
  Announcer: This is one of the most tangled areas 
of the Guerrero mountains? 
  Jimenez: Yes, of course. 
  Announcer: It is one of the more distant areas? 
  Jimenez: Yes. The dead policemen are Second 
Commander Bertoldo Flores Radilla, Second Commander Artemio 
Salmeron Quinonez, and Armando Luna Venancio. Their bodies were 
claimed by their relatives and transferred to their places of 
origin. There is no information whether any arrests have been 
made because as it is Sunday there were no public security 
spokesmen to report what would be done and what action would be 
taken to arrest the guilty. 
  Announcer: Baltazar, the bodies are already in 
Chilpancingo? 
  Jimenez: This is not yet known.

<F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>
  [Excerpts] Diego Valades, head of the Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], declared yesterday that, 
in the PGR's investigations to uncover operations involving the 
"laundering" of money from the drug traffic, "banking secrecy" 
will remain intact. He added that joint efforts are being made 
in this respect with the Secretariat of Finance and Public 
Credit. 
  Commenting on the Mexican state's battle against those 
activities on the part of drug traffickers, he noted that 
meetings are currently being held with officials from Central 
American countries, as well as the United States and Canada. 
Calling this issue one of the main international concerns, he 
remarked that, consequently, the problem will be examined at a 
meeting due to take place in Costa Rica. 
  At a press conference, the third granted by him this week, 
the attorney general of the republic reported that, during 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration, over 
90,000 persons have been remanded for crimes against health. He 
added that some are still being held, and others have now been 
released; explaining that this is contingent on the court 
proceedings. 
  He also revealed that, as a result of the recent penal 
reforms, it is possible that a considerable number of those 
detained for crimes against health may receive releases. He 
identified them, primarily, as the so-called "first offenders," 
as well as the sick and the addicted: persons remanded for 
possessing small amounts of drugs for their individual 
consumption. He commented: "Each case has to be studied 
individually." 
  The nation's attorney general stressed that drug use has not 
been legalized in Mexico, "nor will it be legalized." Adding 
that there is no public opinion nor decision by the Mexican 
state in favor of this, he claimed that no attempt will be made 
to achieve it either. 
  He declared vehemently that the country's sovereignty is not 
in jeopardy because of the drug trafficking problem, citing the 
cooperation existing with other countries to battle the common 
enemy. He admitted that the necessary level of communication has 
not yet been achieved, but observed: "We are gradually 
approaching that point, without in any way endangering our 
sovereignty or the respect for it." [passage omitted] 
  He went on to say that what is of concern now is not only 
the 
status of the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] personnel, but also 
the training for agents of the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office. He claimed: "We must place emphasis on the training and 
qualifications of its personnel, to reinforce our capacity for 
working with the courts." 
  Noting that, for the present, as a general policy, there has 
been no reinstatement of the personnel discharged for any reason 
during recent months, he concluded by saying: "This will 
continue so long as I am heading the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic."

  [Text] Slightly over 16 kg of heroin base worth nearly 5 
million new pesos were seized yesterday by personnel from the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] at the post 
office in the Mexico City International Airport [AICM]. No 
arrests have been made as yet. 
  The drugs were discovered in containers for hairspray and 
chocolate syrup, inserted in a shipment of packaged soap 
arriving from Bangkok, Thailand. The Federal Judicial Police 
director, Adrian Carrera, remarked that this was one of the most 
significant drug confiscations made in the nation's capital. 
  The amount of Thai heroin seized in Mexico City, combined 
with the shipments confiscated during January of this year in 
the towns of Tijuana and Ensenada, brings the present total to 
136 kg. 
  Investigations conducted previously resulted in the 
discovery 
that a large shipment arriving from Asia was to be stored in 
Mexico City for subsequent transfer to the United States. 
  The Interception Directorate of the PGR's National Institute 
To Combat Drugs ordered an operation with members of the 
counternarcotics police detailed to the AICM. The latter, in 
fact, detected the drug shipment at the Mexican Postal Service 
offices in that airport terminal. 
  At 1100, the MPF [Federal Public Prosecutor's Office] 
ordered 
the inspection procedure to be applied, including the shipment 
that arrived from Thailand. What was presumed to be hairspray 
and syrup came in a cardboard box with packages of toilet soap, 
and those hairspray and chocolate syrup containers were found to 
be filled with heroin. 
  The heroin base, with the technical name monoacetylmorphine, 
is an opium gum derivative used as a basic ingredient in 
processing heroin. To produce the narcotic, the 
monoacetylmorphine must be mixed with a liquid chemical reagent, 
known as acetic anhydride. 
  The Federal Judicial Police are continuing the 
investigation, 
and already have clues leading to the arrest of those who were 
to receive the drugs in Ensenada, Baja California. A probe is 
also under way to determine possible links between this shipment 
and others seized recently, because similar methods were used to 
move it from the Asian Continent.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Mota Martinez] </F>
  [Excerpts] Banking systems, unlike stock exchanges, are 
instruments easily used to advantage by those helping drug 
traffickers to purify the sinister origins of the money accrued 
from drugs. 
  Theoretically, in their capacity as objects, they lack 
intentions; and, by the same token, they are not blameworthy for 
being used. [passage omitted] 
  In stock market institutions, cash funds never appear, and 
there is always a correlation between those participating in the 
supply and demand. Moreover, it should be recalled that all the 
commodity firms operating on the Mexican Stock Exchange make 
their living (who would believe it?) from the trading of a mere 
25 stock shares. 
  The market is so slim that it is virtually impossible not to 
know who has carried out transactions. 
  If there is any doubt of my claim, it would be worthwhile 
reading the statements that I quote here: 
  "Money laundering is an illegal activity that cannot be 
achieved through the stock market system, because the 
transactions carried out in it are documented with certified 
checks, and not through the handling of cash." This was the 
assertion made by Rodolfo Leon Leon, ex-president and founder of 
the Mexican Academy of Stock Exchange and Financial Markets Law 
(on 28 January of this year). 
  The same thing does not hold true in the banking 
establishments. 
  One of the reasons for the occurrence of this illicit 
activity is that there are not sufficient numbers of trained 
personnel to maintain permanent contact with the clientele. 
  Banking services will (or should) always be personal but, as 
a result of computerization, clients have been reduced to a 
numerical symbol with which the banks, in many cases, never even 
deal. Rather, they are served, though not known, by those 
assigned to conduct account opening procedures. This task, on 
behalf of the actual money launderers, can be performed by 
anyone who allows himself to be used as a tool of the drug 
traffickers. [passage omitted] 
  Added to the lack of personal acquaintance is the high 
degree 
of rotation among executives in bank branches. 
  No one lasts long in one location now, because the bank 
owners or directors move the employees like chess pieces; 
something which, furthermore, confirms that the absence of 
individual attention occurs first within the banks themselves. 
  Apart from the fact that many bank workers never become 
acquainted with the general director, they do not even know the 
regional director. 
  Those officials are gods whose presence is reserved for 
ostentatious functions. 
  Branch managers are shifted with unusual speed, bringing 
negative consequences for the banks' clients. 
  As if that were not enough, many bank branches have been 
eliminated, because they were located too close to one another. 
In some instances this was due to lack of planning and, in 
others, it resulted from mergers (or strategic alliances, as 
they are now called), also made in a disorderly fashion. 
  Unfortunately, this is not all. 
  The meager, inadequate salaries, almost token in some cases, 
earned by bank personnel, previously considered a privileged 
sector in labor circles, are another negative factor leading to 
the possibility of the banking system's being used extensively 
to launder money. 
  These are some of the reasons that the attorney general of 
the republic, Diego Valades, informed EXCELSIOR (Friday, 18 
February, page 5, first section) that, through a mutual 
agreement with the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat, and 
respecting bank secrecy, an effort is being made to uncover 
money laundering transactions. In this endeavor the authorities 
have the strong cooperation of the bank employees affiliated 
with the National Federation of Bank Workers Unions (Fenasib). 
Its secretary general, Enrique Aguilar Borrego, reiterated to a 
capital newspaper, on 10 January, that "it is fitting to make a 
careful revision of bank workers' pay, because it is possible 
that they may succumb to temptation that would eventually foster 
criminal activities." 
  Two comments regarding this position on the part of the 
attorney general: 
  One of them pertains to the Mexican Association of Banks 
because, despite the public expression of the government's 
concern, the bankers have said nothing, whereas the bank workers 
certainly have done so. 
  The other is related to the fact that Oscar Gonzalez, 
director of legal affairs for the Office of the Attorney General 
of the Republic, declared on 26 January: "A study is being made 
on devising a new law that would prevent money laundering in 
Mexico, and the termination of bank secrecy has not been 
precluded as one of the measures for eliminating this 
phenomenon." 
  That public servant claimed: "The Finance and Public Credit 
Secretariat, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, and the Office 
of the Attorney General of the Republic are already working on 
the plan for regulations containing fiscal revisions to cope 
with this problem." 
  He added to this comment the fact that there is insufficient 
surveillance in Mexico on the part of the National Banking 
Commission, remarking that the complete situation would be 
ascertained. 
  In other words: there is a real possibility, and it is a 
reality, that the banking system may prove to be an immense 
money launderer.

<F P=106> [Report by David Gutierrez Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Approximately 7,000 weapons of various calibers have 
been diverted from Nicaragua to drug traffickers in exchange for 
drugs, marine products, clothing, and household appliances, 
according to Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Arnesto Soza, chief of the 
Special Disarmament Brigade (BED). 
  To protect their merchandise, the drug traffickers use AK-47 
rifles, grenade launchers, and RPG-7's manufactured in the 
former Soviet Union. Lately, there has been fear that they may 
even have in their hands the dangerous surface-to-air missiles, 
known as Redeyes, produced in sophisticated U.S. weapons 
factories. 
  It was estimated that in 1991 in Nicaragua there were 
approximately 80,000 weapons dispersed in the hands of civilians 
and armed groups. The disarmament process has secured 53,000 
weapons of all types, said Ramon Arnesto Soza, during an 
exclusive interview with BARRICADA. It is also estimated that 
there are more than 150,000 explosive devices throughout the 
nation. There are still areas in the country that are 
completely mined where EPS [Sandinist People's Army] sappers 
have discontinued their operation due to lack of funds. 
  The military chief said: "The traffic of weapons diverted to 
drug traffickers is carried out in the Nicaraguan Atlantic area. 
Groups of Miskitos [Indian group] exchange rifles for drugs and 
other things." He added that thousands of weapons have escaped 
over the Honduran and Costa Rican borders. These weapons had 
arrived in Nicaragua through what is now Russia in the last 
decade to defend the nation from the war financed by the U.S. 
Government at that time. 
  Based on these numbers, there are still 27,000 weapons that 
have to be recovered; most of these are AK-47's. To secure 
these, approximately "3 million cordobas are required to offer 
cash in exchange for the weapons," said the BED chief who has 
led the disarmament of all the rearmed groups. This mission will 
conclude with the disarmament of the 3-80 Northern Front. 
  There are still approximately 700 armed men organized in 
small groups devoted to thievery and the kidnapping of peasants 
on the roads and highways, particularly in the northern part of 
the country. 
  The BED has disarmed 130 groups of rearmed men who operated 
in different parts of the nation's territory, among them 9,000 
pro-Sandinist and 14,000 recontras of the Nicaraguan Resistance, 
Yatamas [Indian group], etc. 
  Disarming in exchange for cash, food, and other benefits 
supported by several nations is at a standstill due to a lack of 
funds. Currently, endeavors are being undertaken to secure 
enough cash to resume the program. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front members will be allowed to keep 
their 
small weapons--pistols and revolvers. They will be allowed to 
carry these legally once they turn in their war weapons. 
Subsequently, some will join the police, while others will go 
the fields to work. 
  In the coming months the BED that was initially comprised of 
619 men--between EPS soldiers and former contras -- will 
definitely disappear after they disarm El Chacal's men. These 
men are considered the last remnants of the recontras who took 
up arms again as a result of President Violeta Chamorro 
government's nonfulfillment of commitments. 
  Currently the BED has been reduced to barely 70 men who, 
once 
the last demobilization is carried out on 8 April, will be able 
to join the EPS to engage in other missions, Arnesto Soza said.

  [Text] Panama City, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara revealed that drug operations are 
coordinated with the United States, Spain, Colombia, and Central 
American countries to prevent drug traffickers from "filtering 
their dirty money" into Panama's political and economic sectors. 
"I handle a great deal of confidential information on this 
issue. We have arrested several drug traffickers and we have 
found out the money is moved immediately," Endara told ACAN-EFE 
during an interview held in his office. The Panamanian 
president, who chose not to reveal specific, coordinated cases 
of drug operations, emphasized there is "very extensive" 
cooperation with the United States, Spain, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. 
  Endara said cases in which drug traffickers have been 
arrested, released, and allowed to leave the country have 
occurred many times and cannot be considered isolated events. 
"All of a sudden, we find the drug trafficker is set free and 
allowed to leave the country. It is a worldwide known fact that 
the drug business pays a lot of bribes (illegal money 
commissions)," explained the president regarding the mysterious 
releases. Endara said he has held meetings with Supreme Court 
justices and personnel from the Attorney General's Office to get 
them to adopt measures aimed at preventing such events from 
occurring again. 
  The president, however, emphasized that it is necessary to 
improve the current law on drug trafficking activities. He 
insisted on the need to approve the draft bill he had sent to 
the Attorney General's Office, which the parliament 
"significantly" improved. The new antidrug draft bill introduces 
the figure of a secret agent, which is not included in the 
current law. 
  Endara said it is "absurd" that the same penalties that 
imposed on drug traffickers be applied to a secret agent if 
arrested by the police. He added that agents that infiltrate 
receive the same penalties as drug traffickers who deliver or 
receive drugs. If a secret agent is sent to jail, "we move 
heaven and earth" to get him released. Nobody, however, wants 
to be a secret agent if there are no laws to protect him, the 
president indicated. 
  Last Tuesday, during the inauguration of the parliament's 
last period of sessions, Endara said Panama is being threatened 
by drug trafficking activities, drug use, and money laundering. 
He also asked deputies to combat drug trafficking activities 
and their effects on the country's economic, social, and 
political life. He called on the deputies to approve the new 
law so as to be able to fight this "imported scourge" more 
efficiently.

  [Text] Acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos recognized 
that the job done by U.S. federal narcotics agents in covert 
operations is an act against the country's sovereignty. Davalos 
indicated that the procedures followed by the covert agents in 
Panama are not legal. Because of this we have to be very careful 
because it is a direct act against our sovereignty. 
  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty has not yet been approved 
by the U.S. Senate, and, therefore, the operations conducted by 
the DEA agents are illegal, the acting Attorney General said. 
According to Davalos, at no time since he has been in charge of 
the Attorney General's Office have U.S. narcotics officials 
requested authorization to operate in the country. 
  Covert U.S. federal agents, in an operation set up a year 
and 
a half ago, intercepted more than $10 million in drug 
trafficking money in which lawyers, accountants, and Panamanian 
and Colombian businessmen are allegedly involved. 
  Among those accused are Frank L. Greene, the vice president 
of the firm Merril Lynch International in Panama; Steven L. 
Mills, a top official of the same firm; and Panamanians Ricardo 
Leyton, a lawyer; Charles Richard McFaden, an accountant; and 
businessman Luis Sanchez. Also involved are Jorge Rogelio 
Krupnik, Gilberto Straub and his son, Jorge Rivera, and Patrick 
Van Duel, who according to the list is an official at the 
Colabanco Bank. The bank, however, has stated that Van Duel no 
longer works for them. 
  The acting attorney general pointed out that any procedure 
or 
probe conducted by the Panamanian Government on those involved 
in the drug trafficking network discovered by the federal agents 
has to be conducted through the Foreign Ministry. Likewise, any 
protest by the Panamanian Government toward the United States 
for the covert work performed by the DEA agents has to be filed 
by the Foreign Ministry, from whom a statement in this regard is 
expected. 
  Meanwhile, Hernan Rubio, president of the Bar Association, 
said the entire drug trafficking network discovered by the 
United States is part of a campaign to discredit the country.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero has reported 
that the Panamanian Government is cooperating with the DEA in 
the investigation of crimes related to drug trafficking. 
  The DEA dismantled a drug trafficking ring that laundered 
more than $10 million and was made up of Panamanian and 
Colombian lawyers, accountants, and businessmen. Cordero said 
that there is cooperation with DEA authorities to investigate 
drug related crimes. The diplomat said that he agrees with 
acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos on the rules for this 
cooperation and added that the Foreign Relations Ministry will 
collaborate in this regard. 
  Cordero said that DEA participation in investigations 
related 
to drug trafficking do not violate the country's sovereignty as 
long as Panama grants authorization as a sovereign country, 
which it is. 
  The investigations indicate that distributors in this 
network 
introduced large amounts of cocaine into the United States from 
Colombia and Panama. The deputy foreign minister pointed out 
that DEA agents no longer participate in searches or arrests in 
Panama, leaving these tasks to Panamanian authorities.

  [Text] Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party [PDC] 
presidential candidate, said yesterday "the United States has 
not yet ratified the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between 
Panama and the United States, because that country's Senate 
distrusts Panamanian authorities. [no closing quotation mark as 
published] 
  Vallarino said the economic stagnation as well as 
nonratification of the treaty, which promotes the exchange of 
drug-trafficking data between the two countries, are due to a 
great extent to the distrust of certain senators toward 
Panamanian authorities. 
  The candidate said certain senators fear information given 
to 
Panamanian authorities could end up directly in the hands of 
drug traffickers. 
  Vallarino underscored he cannot pass judgment on this, 
because he cannot say Panamanian authorities would indeed be 
capable of supplying information to drug traffickers. The bad 
thing is, he added, that there is doubt about our officials 
abroad and that there is the belief that a treaty of this nature 
should not be signed, because we do not deserve to be trusted. 
  The Christian Democratic candidate said the country has to 
make the work of the judicial branch and Public Prosecutor's 
Office more credible in order to neutralize the scourge of drug 
trafficking and to prevent Panamanians' association with drug 
trafficking. 
  He added Panama must establish a special corps to fight drug 
trafficking, because the most serious national security threat 
facing this country is the financial power drug traffickers and 
money launderers have used to buy public institutions and even 
political processes in many countries. 
  In conclusion, Vallarino said if Panama fails to adopt 
measures in this regard, we could end up being bought 
politically by drug traffickers and money launderers.

<F P=106> [Article by Roger Rumrrill] </F>
  [Text] Judging by results, there is no reason whatsoever -- 
no economic, political, or social argument -- for continuing the 
antidrug policy implemented in October 1990 as part of the 
so-called "Fujimori Doctrine." 
  Except for the official definition that coca growers are 
farmers who work within the informal sector -- an expression 
coined by General Alberto Arciniega Huby in 1989 and 
subsequently taken up by Hernando de Soto [chairman of the 
Freedom and Democracy Institute] when he classified these 
peasants as valid interlocutors -- the balance of the struggle 
against drug trafficking is lamentable. If there were 5,000 
hectares of coca plantations in the Huallaga Valley back in 1970 
when the cycle started, there are now 300,000 hectares in the 
departments of the Amazon region -- Loreto, San Martin, Madre de 
Dios, and Ucayali. 
  Thus, one of the main objectives of the drug enforcement 
policy -- namely the reduction of coca plantations -- has not 
been attained and neither has the goal to control and check the 
export of drugs. Official sources show that only 9,461.43 
kilograms of drugs were seized in 1993. These 9 tonnes 
represent less than 1 percent of all the drug processed in Peru. 
  The control of money laundering, the clean-up of drug 
kingpins -- the cartel leaders -- and the war against corruption 
throughout the government and society, leaves much to be 
desired. The "Vaticano" case has laid bare a Peruvian society 
racked by corruption. 
  Explaining the reasons behind the change in the U.S. drug 
enforcement policy -- which now emphasizes better control on 
demand, the rehabilitation of addicts, education, and prevention 
-- President Clinton pointed out that the six-year "War on 
Drugs" has cost the American people $56 billion and produced 
hardly any results because the same or more drug enter the 
United States and the number of users continues to increase 
proportionally. Hence the change in outlook and approach. 
  Given the fact that the Clinton administration has adopted 
an 
inward-looking policy, why should we -- the Andean countries -- 
adopt an outward-looking policy? In other words, why should we 
embark on a crop-substitution policy like the one they just 
dropped because of its failure? 
  I believe the centerpiece of a new drug policy in Peru -- 
which should be part of a comprehensive development policy for 
the Amazon region -- must include economic and social 
considerations. On one hand, it should ensure that tropical 
valley producers -- where coca and poppies are farmed -- recover 
their productive capacity, which was nearly destroyed by an 
overly free trade policy (flexible surtaxes are not enough to 
check unfair and abusive competition by foreign countries) and 
by the closure of the Agrarian Bank; that is to say, via a 
system of credits for the agricultural sector. 
  Only 10 percent of credit requirements in the Amazon region 
are at present met by Fondeagros [expansion unknown] and other 
mechanism. The situation in the rest of the country is most 
probably the same. 
  On the other hand, the organization of agricultural 
producers 
into agro-businesses should be given top priority in the social 
area. The entrenched shortcomings of the present marketing 
mechanisms (calling it a system is out of the question) rob 
agricultural producers of nearly 40 percent of their returns or 
earnings. Given this state of affairs, it is impossible to talk 
about streamlining agriculture through the incorporation of 
leading-edge technology geared to stepping up production, to 
diversifying crops, and to promoting agro-industries. 
Modernizing Peruvian agriculture first requires the elimination 
of the middlemen -- who many times are totally unnecessary -- so 
that producers may recover that 40 percent. 
  The establishment of new agro-businesses is of the utmost 
importance to achieve two immediate ends in the new drug policy: 
To negotiate with the European Union, the United States, and 
Japan the sale of our tropical products, and to enable these 
organizations to create a new sustainable productive pattern in 
the Amazon region through the development of administration 
projects and the sensible use of tropical biodiversity. 
  While the first priority for the United States is now to 
combat drug use, for Peru it is to combat production. This 
should not be a military fight, it should be economic, social, 
and political. 
  I believe it is time the struggle against drug trafficking 
in 
Peru was demilitarized. There are several reasons for this: The 
ability for drug trafficking has to corrupt others is immense, 
and the militarization of drug enforcement has failed. The 
results of this are there for everybody to see and the role of 
the military is relegated to other spheres within the new 
strategy. 
  The argument for militarizing the struggle against 
trafficking through the Internal Operations Front Command (Cofi) 
may have something to do with the relationship between political 
subversion and drug trafficking. But this argument is no longer 
valid in 1994. 
  This change in approach and new strategy should lead to a 
change in Peru's antinarcotics legislation, commencing with Act 
No. 22095 enacted in 1978 during Moralez Bermudez's 
administration, as it is interdictory legislation against coca 
from a doctrinal standpoint. 
  As a government campaign to enhance the value of coca -- 
implemented through the Enaco [National Coca Enterprise] -- the 
Foreign Ministry and the peasants should be the hub of this new 
campaign. We have unfortunately lost a precious ally in this 
field, Bolivia, which embarked on the impossible mission of 
eradicating coca crops in an operation whose results will surely 
be reflected in its name -- the Zero Option. Of course it is 
necessary to create the necessary mechanisms and civilian 
institutions to make this new drug policy feasible one in our 
country. Control mechanisms should, at the same time, be 
enhanced. Three Tucano planes flying off into the immensity of 
the Amazon skies are like three swallows that do not make a 
summer.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 9 (CNS) -- Chengdu police recently 
cracked a large drug trafficking case, seizing 26.9 kg of heroin 
and sending 18 criminals to the justice department for handling. 
  According to the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Public 
Security, on August 28 last year, police in the Jinmu District 
of Chengdu Municipality learnt that a gang of people were 
engaging in drug trafficking. Police were immediately sent to 
track down and investigate the case after which they were joined 
by another special police team, organized by the provincial, 
municipal, and district public security departments, taking the 
total number of policemen on the case to over 100. The case was 
finally settled after over 170 days of efforts. 
  The drug trafficking gang was made up of illegal elements 
from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong. Since the first half of 
1992, these criminals, acting in league with overseas drug 
traffickers, had conducted drug trafficking and smuggling 
activities on several occasions, making profits of several 
millions of renminbi. 
  In this case, the police also confiscated five imported 
luxury cars, over 1 million renminbi, and a number of weapons, 
ammunition, and equipment for drug processing.

  [Summary] Qinghai's public security apparatus has broken 
four major drug cases, seized 1.6 kg of heroin, and captured six 
drug criminals. 
  On 30 October 1993, the Xining public security bureau's 
counternarcotics team caught drug trafficker Han Defang [7281 
1795 5364] and seized .527 kg of heroin. During interrogation, 
Han admitted that two of his partners had gone to Yunnan, met 
with one Zhou Kaiqi [0719 7030 2475], and brought back over six 
kg of drugs, which they sold in Lanzhou and Xining. Public 
security cadres investigated and caught Zhou, Han Haode [7281 
1170 4104], and Han Yisi [7281 0044 0934], seizing .5 kg of 
drugs and 28,000 yuan in drug profits. 
  In January 1994, the counternarcotics team investigated drug 
trafficking in Xining by Ma Zhanzhong [7456 0594 1813]. On 4 
January, they caught him and seized .5 kg of heroin. 
Interrogation of Ma led to the 5 January capture of Zhao Zilu 
[6392 1311 4389]. Officials seized .137 kg of heroin and drug 
processing equipment and additives.

  [Text] Vientiane, March 11 (KPL) -- The first village based 
detoxification and rehabilitation programme for opium addicts in 
the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] opened this week in 
Palavek, Vientiane Province, according to a UN Drug Control 
Program's [UNDCP] press release. 
  The UNDCP highland integrated rural development project 
started the three week-long trial with support from a medical 
back-up team from the northern drug dependence treatment centre 
in Chiang Mai, Thailand. 
  Twenty-one addicts voluntarily enrolled at the new unit in 
Nam Khian village, Palavek, to take gradually reduced levels of 
twice-daily administered opium tincture. Medical check-ups, 
vocational training, and social activities are also part of the 
programme. 
  The participants in the detoxification programme are 
accompanied by community health workers from their own village 
who will continue to assist with rehabilitation upon their 
return home. 
  The team from Thailand, led by Dr. Charun Chittiwuthikan, is 
providing training for health workers in detoxification 
procedures, including the proper dosing of opium addicts to 
minimise withdrawal symptoms. 
  Village elders and government officials joined project staff 
and the community for the detoxification programme's opening 
ceremony. 
  A village "shaman" and a "witch doctor" performed 
traditional 
ritual at the new unit, including discarding used opium pipes 
into a nearby stream. Specially composed songs in the Hmong 
language warning of the perils of opium dependency were sung, 
and prizes for children's anti-opium art and a poetry 
competition were presented. 
  Within the project area there are estimated to be 97 addicts 
of whom 70 have said they want to end their drug dependency. 
There are an estimated 40,000 addicts living in the Lao PDR. 
  Many of the addicts said they had become opium dependent 
after taking the drug for a health problem and now wanted to 
give up the habit mainly for economic reasons. 
  UNDCP's highland integrated rural development project, which 
started in July 1989, is implementing development activities to 
create economic and social conditions which eliminate the need 
to grow opium for commercial purposes. Establishing an efficient 
and effective community based health care system is an integral 
part of the project.

  [Text] Taipei, March 7 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou declared a national war against drugs Sunday [6 
March], noting that the number of drug abusers in Taiwan has 
more than doubled since last year. 
  "We cannot stand to be defeated in a second opium war," Ma 
said, urging the government and people to help him fight the 
spread of drugs in Taiwan. 
  In a meeting with 600 parolees at the Ministry of Justice, 
Ma 
warned that drug-related problems have become a serious menace 
to society in terms of economy and social order. 
  Ma said in 1993 alone, 1,110 kilograms of heroin and 5,330 
kilograms of amphetamine were seized by police. The record 
number of drug seizures has pushed the amount of heroin in 
government storehouses to more than 1,500 kilograms, he said. 
  Among 150,000 criminals arrested last year, Ma said, nearly 
50,000 were convicted of drug-related crimes. 
  And there are now an estimated 100,000 drug users in Taiwan, 
up 70 percent over 1992 tallies, he noted. 
  Of that number, he explained, the number of heroin addicts 
grew 130 percent over 1992 estimates, while the number of 
amphetamine addicts increased 54 percent. 
  Ma criticized the government's lack of facilities for drug 
addicts, noting that there are only 150 beds for drug addicts in 
Taiwan hospitals. He also said the policy of imprisoning drug 
addicts is wrong, explaining that drug addicts should be treated 
as patients rather than criminals. 
  The first opium war was sparked after a Ching dynasty 
(1644-1911) official destroyed more than 600 chests of Bengal 
opium imported into China by British merchants. The Ching lost 
the resulting three year war with Britian and was ordered to 
open five ports to foreign traders, pay 21 million yuan in 
indemnities to the British Government and allow the free import 
of opium. 
  At the turn of the century, opium use was so widespread in 
China that seven of every 10 users of opium in the world were 
Chinese, Ma said.

started last year, comprises six [as heard] work plans; namely, 
narcotics crop control, narcotics suppression, narcotics 
prevention, treatment of drug addicts and solving of drug abuse 
problems, and personnel administration and development. The 
workshop of the antidrug officials is expected to help improve 
the operations of the work plans in a systematic manner.

<F P=106> [Article by Tran Anh Tuan in QUAN DOI NHAN DAN: "The </F>
Scourge of Drug Addiction in Cao Bang Is Still Difficult To 
Resolve"--date not given] 
  [Summary] We felt happy to see the local people welcoming 
the New Year upon our arrival in Gao Bang. Incidently, we also 
felt sad as the people of Cao Bang were still languishing in 
poverty. 
  The local people still "live quietly in thatch-roofed and 
dirt-walled houses made from bamboo on various hill sides. All 
the local roads are in rundown condition because they have had 
no repairs at all since they were built several decades ago. 
Cao Bang has also been troubled with many social evils such as 
superstition, drug addiction, prostitution, and so forth. These 
prominent issues have been given attention by various 
responsible organs of Cao Bang. Yet, not much has been done to 
resolve this situation." 
  Mr. Do Quang Son, deputy director of the provincial War 
Invalids and Social Welfare Office and also director of the 
provincial Drug Rehabilitation Center, told us: "Cao Bang 
started growing poppy long before 1985 to get opium for smoking 
and for sales to China. After 1985, Vietnam adopted a policy to 
grow poppy to get opium for export to the Soviet Union for uses 
in processing medicine. Cao Bang, therefore, became one of the 
provinces that participated in opium production. Difficulties 
arose in the course of production and marketing and are also 
responsible for the present scourge of drug addiction. The 
inflow of opium to Cao Bang has increased through various 
smuggling routes from Hanoi, Lang Son, and China, thus worsening 
the scourge of drug addiction. According to statistics provided 
by the War Invalids and Social Welfare Office, the poppy growing 
area in Cao Bang totalled 2,500 hectares in 1990. Incomplete 
statistics also show that the number of drug addicts in the 
province at the time was 13,000. Of them 4,000 were heavily 
addicted. They ranged in age from 16-35." 
  During 1989-90, in compliance with the government's 
Directive 
No. 6 on fighting drug addiction and carrying out drug 
rehabilitation, "the provincial People's Committee set up a 
steering committee for drug control and prevention headed by 
Trieu Dinh Vuong, deputy chairman of the Province People's 
Committee. The province used mass media to spread anti-drug 
propaganda down to every village and hamlet, resulting in 
various poppy growing areas destroyed. In October 1993, the 
province destroyed its last 135 hectares of poppy and spent 
hundreds of millions of dong buying substitution crop seeds for 
poppy growers in return for the destruction of their poppy 
crops. In 1993, the Steering Committee for Drug Prevention and 
Control seized over 100 kilos of raw opium for destruction." 
  Along with anti-drug propaganda, the province has built a 
drug rehabilitation center in the Cao Bang provincial city. "In 
1993, the center gave drug rehabilitation treatment to 390 drug 
addicts before returning them to their normal lives. At 
present, the center is providing drug rehabilitation treatment 
for 540 drug addicts." 
  Each drug addict patient spent some 10,000-20,000 dong for a 
15-day drug rehabilitation course. They receive 300,000 dong as 
a subsidy provided by the state to cover the cost for each 
patient. After they are cured, they have to stay over at the 
center for three months to undergo vocational training. 
  "In 1994, the province plans to provide drug rehabilitation 
for 2,000 drug addicts. Cao Bang Province has striven hard to 
improve its socioeconomic situation, but the results obtained 
are still very limited. Seventy percent of those who received 
drug rehabilitation in 1993 have become addicted again. Some of 
them have had to undergo drug rehabilitation at the center three 
times."

  [Editorial Report] An article published on page 4 of the 21 
January Ho Chi Minh City SAIGON GIAI PHONG in Vietnamese reports 
that in mid-December of last year, the Binh Thanh Market 
Management Unit discovered a Daihatsu van which was going from 
Ho Nai to Ho Chi Minh City, carrying 18 bags containing "black 
color bars of a rather soft substance," weighing 814 kg. 
Subsequently, a lab analysis showed that each kilogram was 9.65 
percent morphine. 
  According to the local anti-drug center, based on the color, 
smell, and morphine content, the substance was actually crude 
opium. Each kilogram of the crude opium currently costs about 
$462 (5 million dong). The case has been turned over to the 
public security office for further investigation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M.K. Kaul] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The United Nations 
International Drug Control Program Agency has recently disclosed 
how the Pakistani drug lords were making fortunes through drug 
exports. Its report titled The Illicit Opiate Industry in 
Pakistan estimated that Pakistan's drug bosses earned roughly 
$2.7 billion annually. And the export earnings which are half 
this amount are as much as the country's legitimate commodity 
export trade. [sentence as heard] Heroin production, goes on 
the UN report, is most profitable in Pakistan with an 
approximate turnover of $2.5 billion. It is a quarter of its 
underground economy, the UN Drug Control Agency's deputy 
director, (Alexander Seggar), is reported to have said in 
Islamabad. He is cited to have said that domestic market itself 
is very large, estimated to be a flourishing business of $1.2 
billion. 
  Pakistan's most dreaded intelligence outfit, Inter Service 
Intelligence, is known to push drug traffickers into Kashmir for 
subversive activities after leading them up the garden path. 
[sentence as heard] India lies in the middle of what is known 
as the Golden Crescent, comprising Afghanistan, Iran and 
Pakistan. From India, the drugs find their routes to the U.S. 
and other Western countries and the enormous funds thus realized 
come handy to finance terrorism in Kashmir. Just a few months 
ago, the vigilant Indian security and paramilitary forces nabbed 
subversives from across the border carrying huge quantities of 
heroin and opium in the Jammu sector. The Border Security Force 
authorities were surprised to find 13 kg of heroin and 11 kg of 
opium in a single catch. 
  The politician-drug mafia nexus is an open secret in 
Pakistan, a Central Intelligence Agency commission reports, 
which gave out the details of drug bosses' connections with the 
important politicians. [sentence as heard] The Pakistani 
newspapers vied with each other in flashing the news about the 
politician-drug lord nexuses. A crime boss of Lahore, who also 
headed a drug syndicate, had close connection with the family of 
a former prime minister as was traced by the U.S. intelligence 
agency report. Though the family of the former prime minister 
vociferously denied it, it did not carry much conviction even 
with the people in Pakistan. Since the report was leaked just a 
month ahead of the last Pakistani general election, it did its 
damage to the former prime minister as his political outfit lost 
rather cheaply in the poll. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ahmedabad, Jan 23--Gujarat is fast becoming a haven 
for drug traffickers as a result of the sealing of the Punjab 
and Jammu and Kashmir borders with Pakistan. 
  The Seizure of 1,600 kg of mandrax tablets valued at Rs 2.5 
crore, by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) from a 
godown at Gota village near Ahmedabad last week is an 
eye-opener. DRI officials also got the clue that the drug 
traffickers were operating systematically in the city. They had 
manufactured mandrax tablets outside the city and were using 
local agents for the distribution of the tablets in other parts 
of the State. 
  Dr. Yusuf Merchant, honorary director of the Drug Abuse 
Information Rehabilitation and Research Centre (DAIRRC) of 
Bombay, recently met about 10,000 drug addicts in Gujarat and 
Bombay during the course of their rehabilitation camps. 
  The number of drug addicts in Gujarat has risen from 800 in 
1989 to a staggering 70,000 in 1993. According to a survey 
conducted by DAIRRC, every year about 4,500 more people in the 
State are becoming drug addicts. About 400 drug addicts from the 
State had undergone treatment for de-addiction at DAIRRC in the 
last three years. 
  About 5,000 cases of de-addiction have been registered with 
the Gujarat Kelavni Trust in the last five years. The DAIRRC 
survey said about 75,000 drug addicts belonged to four major 
cities. Out of this, Ahmedabad accounts for 30,000 cases, 
followed by Baroda 20,000, Surat 17,000 and Rajkot 13,000. 
  Drug addiction has been detected among prisoners of the 
Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad, according to the survey 
made by the Gujarat Kelavni Trust, Dr Nathubhai Patel, honorary 
director of the trust," said "a day care centre" had been set up 
in the prison by the trust to study the drug addiction habits 
among the prisoners, social workers visit the jail once in a 
week to motivate the prisoners against falling prey to drug 
addiction.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Combating the Illegal Drug Trade"] </F>
  [Text] To combat the drug trafficking problem in our 
region, the International Drug Control Board (IDCB) has urged 
Iran, Pakistan and Turkey to pool their resources and fight the 
smuggling of illegal narcotics. 
  Drug prices have recently dropped. Latest reports say that 
the price of Hashish has fallen from 200,000 to 90,000 rials per 
kilo in the last two years. Meanwhile, Iran's anti-drug forces 
seize tons of contraband drugs and make hundreds of drug-related 
arrests each month. 
  To compensate for their losses resulting from low narcotics 
prices, the traffickers are smuggling greater volumes and are 
expanding their overseas markets despite the risk of 
imprisonment and execution. 
  The IDCB's declaration, last Tuesday, suggested that the 
best 
way to eradicate drug smuggling is for Iran, Pakistan, and 
Turkey to start harmonious regional and international campaigns 
aimed at combating the cultivation, production, trafficking, 
distribution, and consumption of illegal narcotics. 
  Since in this region Pakistan and Afghanistan are the main 
producers of drugs, it is incumbent upon their governments to 
pay more attention to this problem by confronting the smugglers 
and weeding out corrupt government officials who facilitate the 
cultivation and transport of illegal drugs. 
  Khorasan and Sistan-Baluchestan provinces, bordering with 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, provide fertile grounds for drug 
smugglers. Almost 70 per cent of drug arrests in Iran are made 
in these two provinces. 
  According to informed sources, several groups in Afghanistan 
are fighting over control of areas where Poppy is cultivated. 
Drugs are the only source of foreign or even domestic 
currencies in the area. Extreme poverty has always been the root 
of many evils. Afghanistan is in dire need of international 
financial help to return to cultivation of its traditional crops 
and give up producing poppy. It also needs to be reminded that 
if no efforts are made to arrest corrupt officials and local 
leaders who supply the smugglers with contraband drugs, the 
international community is prepared to take punitive measures 
against it. 
  Pakistan and Iran also need to pursue their policy of 
eradicating drug-related businesses. They must also increase 
their efforts towards identifying and arresting officials who 
collaborate with drug lords. Recent arrests in Khorasan are 
quite promising, but the public must also be made aware, through 
advertising campaigns, of the damage that narcotics can inflict 
on individuals and societies. 
  Iran is the gateway through which drugs from Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, as well as from South and West Asia, reach Western 
Europe and the United States. All countries concerned should 
help in this fight against narcotics. International 
intelligence agencies must freely, and without attaching any 
political strings, share all relevant information with Iran 
enabling it to crush smuggling operations within and through its 
territory. 
  International intelligence agencies could supply Iran with 
satellite information pinpointing opium cultivated lands and 
smuggling routes. 
  International cooperation is the only way to break down the 
power of local drug lords and to once and for all put an end to 
illegal farming and smuggling of narcotics.

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, March 7 (AFP) -- A crisis is 
brewing in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley where farmers are 
determined to defy a ban on planting hashish unless the 
government keeps its promise to help find an alternative crop. 
  Farmer say they are ready for a new confrontation with the 
authorities, two years after the government eradicated hashish 
and poppy fields in cooperation with Syrian intelligence 
services. 
  "I'm afraid of God and no one else," said 65-year-old Zayd 
Sharif, banging his cane on the ground where hashish once grew 
freely and earned farmers and smugglers between 500 million 
dollars and one billion dollars per year. 
  The season to grow hashish in eastern Lebanon begins at the 
end of March. 
  Sharif and other farmers, according to experts, earned about 
15 percent of hashish earnings, with the rest going to smugglers 
and merchants, but it was enough to secure what many people here 
call "a decent life." 
  "Hashish meant I could build a stone house to replace my mud 
house. It helped me feed, clothe and educate my children," 
Sharif said. "If my son went hungry, I'd even kill my brother to 
feed him." 
  Sharif said his family was now in need because the 
government 
reneged on promises to help find an alternative crop to hashish. 
  Like other farmers Sharif never saved money from his hashish 
earnings for a rainy day. "I never thought that day would come," 
he said. 
  A security official in the region said farmers had been 
warned time and again to avoid dealing with hashish. Violators 
-- farmers, merchants and smugglers -- can face up to seven 
years in jail. 
  The authorities in 1992 launched a massive crackdown on 
widespread hashish and poppy growing in the al-Biqa' with the 
help of Syrian troops who have been deployed in Lebanon since 
1976. 
  Around 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of hashish were destroyed 
in 1992. The following year, some farmers took up arms to 
resist but the authorities burned 100 hectares (250 acres) of 
hashish. 
  Bernard Frahi of the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) told a 
regional meeting in Damascus last month that the Syrian-backed 
campaign had been "successful in eradicating illegal crops" from 
the al-Biqa'. 
  But the former director of the state-run Green Plan project, 
'Abdallah Yazbik, dismissed this as wishful thinking. 
  "They are fooling themselves unless they adopt a grass-roots 
plan to improve agriculture in the region, provide farmers with 
subsidies, financial and expert assistance and a means to sell 
their produce," Yazbik told AFP. 
  On February 7, Lebanon signed a 4.2 million-dollar deal with 
the UNDCP and the UN Development Programme to help farmers grow 
alternative crops, sell their produce and improve irrigation in 
the Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil area of eastern al-Biqa'. 
  Yazbik said the project had been on the back-burner since 
1990. He linked its full implementation to peace in the Middle 
East. 
  "It's a five-year plan. The first phase of it which was 
signed last month involves lending farmers money to get started 
on planting new crops," he said. 
  "But how can you sell a 4.2 million dollar project to people 
who were earning between 500 and 600 million dollars annually 
from hashish? It's ludicrous," he said. 
  Yazbik, farmers and experts agree that the authorities are 
not addressing the problem seriously and that the issue is not 
only hashish but the overall situation of agriculture in Lebanon. 
  The al-Biqa', dubbed Lebanon's bread basket, has 
traditionally suffered from a lack of private and public 
investment, and because of the war the situation has 
deteriorated. 
  'Ali Ra'd, a veterinarian employed by the UN's International 
Fund for Agricultural Development, called for a long-term 
project in which international organisations would work hand in 
hand with the farmers. 
  "The frightening thing is that during a recent survey of the 
al-Biqa' an expert told us `there is no alternative to hashish,' 
and that's the truth unless we launch a long-term project to 
rehabilitate the entire sector. 
  "We need to survey our animal wealth, establish studies to 
see what are the best cash crops for the area, improve 
irrigation but also build schools, roads, and clinics for the 
villages and set up cooperatives," he said.

  [Text] Tripoli, March 6 (AFP)--Convicted drug dealers and 
producers will be treated as spies and could face the death 
sentence following a change in the law here, an official said 
Sunday [6 March]. 
  The law was amended to say that "any activities linked to 
drug production, manufacture or trade, will be considered as 
conniving with the enemy," the source said. 
  Those found guilty of espionage already risk the death 
penalty, but convicted drug dealers previously only faced jail 
sentences. 
  Drug addicts are not affected by the change, and if found 
guilty still face a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 
rehabilitation programmes, the official added. 
  Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi accused the United States 
and Israel in January of propagating drugs in Arab countries in 
"a cold war aimed at destroying them."

dissatisfaction. At the prime minister's instruction, a new list 
has been prepared about the people involved in the present drug 
Mafia and its three syndicates. This list was given to the 
Narcotics Control Board after approval by the prime minister. 
According to the new list, about 200 important persons are

  [Text] According to a news report, chemicals used for 
making heroin worth about one million [currency not specified] 
were "cleared" at Lahore railway station on arrival by the 
Samjhota Express from India. The intelligence agents later 
arrested the smugglers as they emerged from the railway station, 
and they have registered a case against the superintendent of 
customs. The production of heroin was initially started by the 
CIA in Afghanistan to creat money for supplying weapons to the 
forces opposing the Soviet Union. For about a decade the United 
States looked the other way. Now it considers appropriate to 
ignore all its own "actions" and prefers to accuse Pakistan of 
it. Against this background, if we review this incident of 
seizure of chemicals used in making heroin, it is clear that 
India is also involved in this drama to give Pakistan notoriety 
for making heroin. The law enforcement agencies should keep all 
this in mind and arrest the involved persons.

<F P=106> [Report from the press review] </F>
  [Text] On the front page of today's Sunday edition of the 
MZALENDO newspaper, we read that 12,000 persons have been 
arrested in connection with drug dealing. The business of drug 
trafficking increases instead of decreasing. 
  The number of drug dealers arrested in this country has 
increased from four in 1982 to 12,000 persons in 1990, according 
to reports released by the Immigration Department. 
  According to this department, those arrested for dealing in 
drugs such as mandrax and heroin include young children, some of 
them girls. Police officers said that five packets of mandrax 
were seized in 1960 and over seven tonnes were seized in 1993. 
A police spokesman added that this is just a very small 
proportion of the drugs being trafficked through Tanzania's 
ports, airports, and roads. The police spokesman said that most 
of the drugs are routed via southern Africa to the European 
markets. The police statement added that bribery and corruption 
allowed the drug business to flourish in Tanzania. A bundle of 
$5,000, equivalent to 2.5 million Tanzania shillings, was enough 
to make some of the police and customs officers allow the drugs 
in and to turn a blind eye which enables the drug dealers to 
continue with their business, bringing the businessmen great 
benefits, concludes MZALENDO.

  [Text] Haskovo, March 6 (BTA correspondent) -- 15.556 
kilos of heroin were seized at 1.30 a.m. on Sunday by customs 
officers at the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint on the 
Bulgarian-Turkish border. The drug was found in 28 heavily 
perfumed bags hidden in the door sills of an Audi car. Arrested 
were Imam Yetkinbuak and Ali Mutlu, both aged 37, resident in 
the Netherlands for many years. Both are unemployed. One of 
them is scheduled for heart surgery. An investigation is under 
way in Svilengrad. Under Bulgarian law the trafficking of large 
amounts of drugs carries a 5 to 15 years' prison term.

  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- Turkish drug trafficker 
Ibrahim Pinar, who got a six-and-a-half-year sentence last year 
for smuggling large quantities of heroin, will be brought to a 
second trial. 
  This was ruled by the Supreme Court following a supervisory 
review of the already enforced sentence, pronounced by the court 
in Ruse (northeastern Bulgaria) back on July 13, 1993. The drug 
trafficker was found guilty of smuggling on two occasions a 
total of 13.5 kg of heroin of 60 percent purity, worth 3,432,000 
leva, across the border checkpoints at Kapitan Andreevo and Ruse. 
  The judges of the court in Ruse qualified the case as a 
grave 
crime, but pronounced a sentence of six and a half years, 
although for such cases the law provides between 5 and 15 years. 
At the same time the court found the defendant innocent of the 
charges that he carried in his luggage half the amount of heroin 
when going from one border checkpoint to the other. 
  This sentence was contested by the prosecutor and as a 
second 
instance on October 14 the Ruse Regional Court repealed the 
sentence in its acquitting part and returned the case for trial 
by another panel of the court. This ruling was criticized by 
the prosecutor general of the Republic who suggested that the 
Supreme Court repeals it. In this way, after the Supreme Court 
judges examined the sentence under the supervisory review, they 
repealed the amended part and returned the case for 
reconsideration from the stage of hearing.

<F P=106> ["Drug Enforcement Institution Leaders Clash"--BTA headline] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- "Official figures set the 
number of drug addicts in Bulgaria at 1,200, unofficially, they 
are said to be about 15,000, but nobody actually knows how much 
they really are," KONTINENT wrote yesterday [9 March]. This 
daily carried interviews with Bulgaria's "top three drug 
experts," Prof. Todor Stankushev of the Psychiatry Department 
with the Aleksandrovska Hospital in Sofia, Filip Lazarov, 
associate professor and head of the drug addicts clinic in 
Sukhodol (near Sofia), and Aleksandrina Nencheva, head of the 
National Drug Enforcement Service. "[Three] professionals 
clashed aspiring to the top office," KONTINENT comments. 
  Drug abuse has not yet become a large-scale phenomenon in 
Bulgaria, Prof. Stankushev claims and goes on to say that most 
of his patients know each other. "The official figures we have 
set the number of drug addicts at 1,280, all of them registered 
at the mental hospitals," Ms. Nencheva says for her part. 
According to her the much-publicized drug-abuse boom is a stunt 
since Bulgaria has no efficient monitoring system in this 
sector. Mr. Lazarov, too, shares the view that the effective 
system for registering drug addicts is outdated. Surveys 
carried out by the Sukhodol clinic found that 23 percent of the 
school children in the major Bulgarian cities have tried some 
kind of drugs, be it heroin, glue or sedatives. "I myself 
believe drug addicts to be much more [than the official 
figures]," says Mr. Lazarov while Ms. Nencheva accuses him for 
using the official figures to conceal the actual proportions 
drug abuse has assumed in this country. 
  The National Centre on Drug Abuse, which is to be set up, 
and 
the Oncology Hospital are placed on an equal footing, Prof. 
Stankushev says. "The Sofia Municipality, for example, has 
adopted a 1 million leva (about $25,000) drug enforcement 
programme setting 200,000 leva for awareness campaigns at a time 
when it faces a severe funds shortage preventing it from paying 
the wages to polyclinics medics," Prof. Stankushev also says. 
"Why my colleagues of the Sukhodol clinic spend the funds they 
get from sponsors for business trips and not for medicines," he 
goes on to say. [sentence as received] 
  "We have established contacts with some 20 international 
organizations and there are interesting proposals for joint 
projects," Mr. Lazarov says. He threatens to set up a parallel 
private institution in case others are named to head the 
National Centre. The programme of the clinic envisages the 
setting up of a city centre with a department for 
nonconventional methods of work whose officers will seek to 
penetrate into drug addicts' communities. 
  The National Drug Enforcement Service was set up to meet the 
commitments this country has taken under international 
conventions concerning drugs, Ms. Nencheva tells the KONTINENT 
interviewer. It is designed to organize and enforce nationwide 
control over the transportation of narcotic substances. "The 
quantity of narcotics passing transit through the territory of 
this country follows a persistent upward trend," Ms. Nencheva 
says. 
  "Apart from the coordination between experts [of the 
different institutions] there is a clash and this is the reverse 
side of the medal," Ms. Nencheva says to sum up the current 
trends dominating the drug enforcement institutions in Bulgaria.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 March (MTI) -- One Turkish and two 
Hungarian citizens have been taken into custody by Hungarian 
police on charges of heroin smuggling, Csongrad County Police 
Headquarters informed journalists in Szeged on Friday [11 March]. 
  A tourist coach returning from Turkey arrived at the Roszke 
(Hungarian-Yugoslav) border station on Wednesday [9 March] 
afternoon. In the course of a routine inspection, Hungarian 
customs officers discovered a secret compartment under the back 
stairs containing 136 bags of heroin, each weighing about 
530-550 grams -- a total of 73.15 kg. 
  The coach had been hired from a travel agency by a 
29-year-old Budapest resident. There were two drivers, but only 
one of them, a 25-year-old man from Budapest, allegedly knew 
about the hidden drugs. The smugglers allegedly agreed with the 
owner of the bus to transport the heroin into Hungary for 600 
German marks per kilogram. The owner is said to have been 
present during the loading of the drugs but he has not been 
located, as he apparently returned to Hungary by plane. 
  Neither the identity of the owner nor the final destination 
of the heroin is known by the police. A Turkish travel agency 
manager is also suspected of being involved, but his role has 
not been clarified yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Birthe Lauritsen: "New Drug Route to Street"] </F>
  [Text] A West African drug gang is creating thousands of 
new drug abusers in Denmark. The problem has grown at the same 
time as there has been an explosive increase in the number of 
asylum-seekers from the African continent. 
  African drug gangs are wreaking havoc on the Danish drug 
market, where their smoking heroin is creating thousands of new 
drug addicts. They follow a very definite pattern when they come 
here--often exploiting our asylum regulations--and the hard 
drugs are concealed in their bodies. 
  This development is causing growing concern among both the 
Danish police and Interpol. 
  In recent years Africans from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria in 
particular have dominated the picture of a growing African drug 
market in this country. At the same time the number of 
asylum-seekers from several African countries has risen sharply. 
If refugees from the former Yugoslavia are excluded, almost one 
out of every two asylum-seekers in 1993 was from Africa. In 1992 
Africans represented just under 30 percent, while in 1990 their 
share was as low as 15 percent. This should be seen in relation 
to the fact that by and large only refugees from the devastating 
civil war in Somalia are granted asylum. 
  "New people come here all the time, and they do not come out 
of a clear blue sky. Someone organizes their trip here," 
Detective Superintendent Mogens Lundh, head of the National 
Police Commissioner's drug information division, told BERLINGSKE 
TIDENDE. 
  The pattern is that the future asylum-seeker gets a ticket 
and receives money from his "brothers" in Denmark and then -- 
after registering at an asylum center -- he partially moves in 
with his friends/contacts. 
  By seeking asylum, foreigners acquire a better status in 
comparison with ordinary tourists if they are arrested in 
connection with criminal activities. In contrast to tourists, 
asylum-seekers can demand to stay in Denmark while their cases 
are being processed. And Africans' asylum cases are especially 
likely to take a long time. It is difficult to establish an 
individual's identity because he often has passports from 
several countries. In this way he can change his nationality if 
the first one does not entitle him to asylum. And then the case 
begins all over again. 
  According to Lundh, a corresponding procedure is used in 
attempts to enter Denmark so that a person expelled on drug 
charges simply returns with a new nationality. 
<H5>  Swallow Drug-Filled Condoms </H5>
  Eleven Africans were arrested in Denmark in connection with 
drug smuggling in 1993, according to Interpol. But as no 
statistics are kept on the status of arrested foreigners it is 
impossible for the police to say how many of the Africans 
charged with drug offenses came here as asylum-seekers. 
  According to Lundh they typically come with 50-200 grams of 
pure heroin concealed in their bodies. The drug is swallowed in 
a package -- condoms, for example -- that protects it on its 
passage through the intestinal system. Later it is cut so that 1 
gram represents a value of around 4,000 kroner on the street. 
  The method used to smuggle the drugs in is the reason why 
there are large quantities of heroin in circulation in Denmark 
in spite of the efforts at the borders. Detecting drugs in a 
suspect's stomach is difficult and requires detaining him until 
nature brings the substance out in the open. 
  The African heroin is sold all over the country -- with a 
preponderance in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen where it 
is sold quite openly. 
  "The Africans have developed a special technique that 
enables 
them to remove the evidence at any time. They simply swallow it. 
And when we are out of the way they stick a finger down their 
throat and get the goods back intact," said a vice squad 
spokesman. 
  The police are now trying to stop this practice by simply 
taking suspects along to Vestre Prison's infirmary where they 
are left to sit on the can until the drugs show up. This has 
already paid off on several occasions in January. In one case 
two Gambians swallowed 26 small packets containing a total of 
3.62 grams of very high quality heroin. It had a street value of 
almost 15,000 kroner. 
  One was deported while the other, who has a Danish spouse, 
was imprisoned. 
<H5>  High Price for Danish Brides </H5>
  The police cannot disclose the status of the marriage. But 
in 
their experience it is common for passionate love between an 
African and a Dane to spring up when all avenues of appeal in an 
asylum case are on the point of being exhausted. 
  Among Africans the price of a marriage is said to be 
15-20,000 kroner. Some bride prices have reportedly been around 
50,000 kroner. 
  Marriage to a Dane automatically ensures foreigners of a 
residence permit and this occurs "fairly often," as Jorgen 
Cemnitz, the leader of the Danish Red Cross asylum division, 
said. If such a marriage occurs they automatically drop out of 
the asylum system. 
  "Formerly Africans acted as couriers, especially for 
Pakistani drug dealers. But that time is past. Today we have two 
independent drug gangs that cover all aspects after the drugs 
are produced in Thailand and Pakistan. This means purchasing, 
distribution, and sales," said Lundh. 
  The gangs are based in West and East Africa respectively. 
The 
eastern gang members come from Uganda, Somalia, and Tanzania and 
the western ones from Ghana, Gambia, and Nigeria. And while the 
western organization is strongest in Denmark, the other Nordic 
countries notice the eastern gang more. It also operates in this 
country -- but on a smaller scale than the western one. 
  The money earned from the drug trade is spent partly on 
lavish consumption in Denmark and partly on non-drug-related 
investments in their homelands. 
  "In contrast to drug dealers from Turkey and Pakistan, for 
example, the Africans are well educated. Many have a heavy 
academic ballast," said Mogens Lundh, who thinks the connection 
between Denmark and Africa has its roots in earlier charter 
trips. 
  Interpol estimates that a total of around 10 percent of all 
the world's money comes from drugs -- through production, sales, 
or consumption. This tells almost the whole story about the 
battle the police and customs agents are up against. 
  It is estimated that illegal cocaine sales alone amount to 
2.5 trillion kroner worldwide. 
<H5>  Nordic Lands of Special Interest </H5>
  Heroin and cocaine are regarded as the means of payment of 
the downtrodden. Drug money can be used to buy arms for the 
struggle for liberation and independence. The hunger and 
widespread poverty in Africa also cause an increase in the 
supply of hard drugs. Therefore countries like Denmark are 
flooded with the deadly narcotics. We have the opposite 
commodities -- peace, money, and the coveted standard of living. 
  The Nordic region is also interesting because of the many 
daily connections with places like Russia, Poland, and the 
Baltic states. 
  "This provides many opportunities to get the desired goods 
inside the EU [European Union] community," they say at 
Interpol's European headquarters in Lyon, France. 
  As a countermeasure, the Nordic countries have set up 
several 
working groups that try to obtain as much information from the 
individual cultures as possible about such things as behavior, 
bases, smuggling techniques, and networks. 
  "This makes it a little easier for us to know what special 
things we should look for when they come through customs," said 
Lundh. 
  In the last two years 50 Africans carrying large quantities 
of heroin have been arrested at various Nordic borders. 
  "And that is a large number," Lundh added. In numerical 
terms 
Africans involved in heroin cases make up over half of all those 
arrested. When it comes to the quantity of drugs, Turks, 
Iranians, and Pakistanis are still in the lead because, unlike 
the Africans, they dispatch whole truckloads. 
  On the other hand it, can be harder to unmask the Africans 
if 
the market share rises in proportion to the number of couriers. 
Five years ago there were practically no Africans among those 
arrested in the Nordic countries in connection with drugs. 
  In Denmark around 20 different nationalities that operate on 
the drug market have been recorded, but there are no statistics 
on the percentage of asylum-seekers. 
  However several asylum centers confirm that the behavior of 
many of the Africans is strikingly different from that of other 
asylum-seekers. They do not live at the centers, but come in 
only when they have to pick up pocket money -- or they are 
reported missing and drop out of the system. And their 
consumption of luxury items--including the use of taxis -- is 
extremely high. 
  Deputy director Henrik Dahl Sorensen of the Directorate of 
Alien Affairs confirmed that there is a widespread tendency -- 
also among Africans -- to "take advantage of the system," as he 
put it. 
  However very few Africans are granted asylum. Broadly 
speaking it is granted only to people who come here from 
Somalia, a country ravaged by civil war. In the two other big 
groups -- from Gambia and Togo -- only a few (from Togo) have 
been granted asylum to date. 
  But Sorensen also acknowledged that "there are very big 
problems in establishing the correct identity." 
  There were around 2,000 African asylum-seekers in 1993, half 
of whom came from Somalia and around 300 from Gambia, while over 
150 came from Togo and around 120 from Uganda. 
  The introduction of compulsory visas from several African 
countries has apparently not moderated the interest in Denmark.

<F P=106> [Article by Morten Pihl: "The Folketing Positive to New Kind </F>
of Sentencing"] 
  [Text] Drug treatment. Political reaction to a proposal 
letting drug addicts escape punishment if they agree to undergo 
treatment is positive. 
  A broad political majority in the Folketing supports the 
Progressive Party's proposal to let drug addicts escape a prison 
term by undergoing treatment to recover from their addiction. 
  This can be seen from a poll conducted by BERLINGSKE 
TIDENDE. 
  "It is completely insane to put these young people behind 
bars. They will not be rehabilitated that way," says the vice 
chairman of the Judicial Committee, Ebba Strange (SF [Socialist 
People's Party]): 
  "The criminal code provides for the possibility to sentence 
people to undergo treatment. This opportunity should be used 
somewhat more, and more treatment centers should be provided." 
  The Progress Party's proposal is aimed at drug users who 
commit crimes related to their drug abuse. 
  This proposal was submitted a short time after the proposal 
from the Conservatives concerning, among other things, life 
terms for financial kingpins in the drug world. 
<H5>  Liberal Party Agrees </H5>
  "We agree in fact with both proposals, to say it in a 
radical 
way," Birthe Ronn Hornbech, the Progressive Party's legal 
spokesperson, says: 
  "The financial kingpins should be hunted down, [while at the 
same time] the addicts must be helped. Just punishing the 
addicts does not accomplish this, so let us try sentencing 
addicts to undergoing treatment. We already have a corresponding 
arrangement for drunk drivers. But there must be a relationship 
to the crimes they have committed." 
  Viggo Fischer, the Conservatives' spokesperson in narcotics 
matters, is not enthusiastic about the proposal, but is willing 
to discuss treatment in lieu of punishment in cases of low-level 
crime and first offenders. 
  "But this must be under the condition that the addicts 
continue with their treatment -- by force if necessary. Our goal 
is to have treatment take place in drug-free prison wards," 
Fischer says. 
  As mentioned in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE yesterday, the Progress 
Party also proposes that the treatment of drug abusers be 
financed by the national government rather than the present 
arrangement where it is being paid for by the counties and the 
municipalities, and that an independent council be created to 
furnish information about drugs and drug abuse. 
<H5>  Positive Initiative </H5>
  "The Progress Party has presented a surprisingly positive 
initiative," says Frank Jensen, the political spokesman for the 
Social Democratic Party, who is especially happy about the idea 
of providing treatment rather than punishment and the proposal 
about government financing. 
  The political parties disagree as to the need for government 
financing, and both the Liberal Party and the Conservatives 
reject the need for an independent drug council. 
<H5>  Drug Addict: Everyone Will Accept </H5>
  A drug-addicted prostitute from Vesterbro in Copenhagen says 
that all the addicts she knows will accept an offer to avoid 
prison by accepting drug treatment. 
  "Yes, definitely. Everyone I know will accept. For sure." 
  The 29-year-old addicted prostitute who used the name 
"Maria" 
has no doubt. 
  If she was offered treatment so she could overcome her 
addiction and thereby avoid prison when she had stolen money, 
credit cards, or checks from her customers, she would accept. 
  "Maria" approves of the proposal from the Progress Party to 
the help drug addicts who commit crimes arising from their abuse. 
  "They should be offered treatment instead of prison.'' 
  ``All addicts would like to be helped, but treatment that 
lasts only four months does not have much effect.'' 
  ``And there is not sufficient capacity to treat everybody.'' 
  "It does not do any good when nobody is there to take care 
of 
you when you sit there crying, having a hell of a time, and are 
ready to quit," "Maria" says. 
  We met "Maria" at Halmtorvet, and over a Jolly Cola at 
Freddy's Bar she tells us that she has been an addict since she 
was 11 years old. 
  "Cocaine and heroin. I spend 1,800 kroner a day on drugs. I 
walk the streets to make the money, and I have been convicted of 
having stolen cash, checks, and credit cards from my customers," 
"Maria" says. 
  Her face is sunken and pale, she has lost several teeth, 
"they were knocked out" and her neck and hands bear signs of 
drug abuse over many years. She is dressed completely in black, 
boots, pants, shirt, coat. 
  She tells us that she has been in prison four times--every 
time because of drugs. She was off drugs for four years when she 
lived at Jutland, but as soon as she returned to Vesterbro, she 
went back to the needle. 
<H5>  Treatment Opportunity Unused </H5>
  Drug treatment: A catastrophic lack of treatment centers is 
the reason why so many addicts end up in jail rather than in 
treatment centers, according to a physician. 
  Even now the criminal code offers the possibility of 
sentencing drug addicts to treatment rather than incarceration, 
but this possibility is mostly unused. 
  "It is relatively rare that someone is sentenced to 
treatment 
because there is a lack of treatment centers and because it is 
expensive," says Peter Ege, the director of medicine of 
Copenhagen county. 
  "Maybe it happens 20 times a year that someone is sentenced 
to treatment. This must be seen in relation to the fact that 
there are about 1,100 drug addicts in prison," he says. 
  Ege's remarks come in response to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's 
comments yesterday on four proposals that the Progress Party 
will submit next week. 
  These proposals are to the effect that drug addicts who 
commit crimes stemming from their drug abuse shall be offered 
treatment instead of incarceration; that the treatment shall be 
financed by the national government instead of by the counties 
as it is at present; that a council for information about drug 
abuse be created, and that a treatment model like the one in 
Rome, where 85 out of 100 people go through a drug treatment 
plan, be adapted for Danish conditions. 
  "It would be wonderful if treatment could be government 
financed, because it is not reasonable that Copenhagen County 
should pay for the treatment of all the addicts in the country," 
Ege says, while still being somewhat doubtful that it is 
economically and politically realistic to expect the proposal to 
be carried out. 
  There is capacity to treat about 2,000 addicts while there 
are at least 10,000 addicts. 
  Ege realizes that the capacity for treatment must reach 
3,000-4,000 to meet the need. There is especially a need for 
24-hour care centers, he says. 
  Director Jorgen Green, the head of Storstroms County Youth 
Center in Vordingborg, says that the Progress Party's proposal 
will remedy the problems created by the funding [mechanism] of 
the drug measures. The efforts to furnish treatment have been 
made without any oversight by the government, and they have 
suffered from the counties' and municipalities' budgetary 
cutbacks with the result that drug abusers ended up in jail 
instead. By letting money for treatment and prison 
administration come from the same source, the treasury, 
solutions based on economic considerations can be avoided when 
it comes to choosing between treatment and prison, Green opines. 
  "An increase in the number of drug related deaths cannot be 
seen as a result of the efforts of the police or as a rise in 
drug abuse, but must be regarded first and foremost as a sign of 
both poor quantity and quality in drug treatment and a lack of 
concerted action against drug abuse in Denmark," Green says. 
  Both he and Ege approve on the whole of the Progress Party's 
four proposals, and they agree that in the long run they will 
lead to large savings for, among other things, the judicial 
system, because successfully treating drug addicts will lead to 
less crime; crime that the addicts commit in order to get money 
for drugs.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Jeweler Gets Five Years for </F>
Heroin Trafficking"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [18 January] the members of a gang that 
had been trafficking heroin in the Helsinki metropolitan area 
were sentenced to prison terms of varying lengths. The chief 
perpetrators of the gang were sentenced two weeks ago, and now 
the dealers lower down on the scale have been sentenced. 
  The most severe sentence on Tuesday was handed down to Kim 
Christian Sjoblom, a 41-year-old Helsinki jeweler. He was 
sentenced to five years in prison for possession of over 
one-half kilo of heroin. Sjoblom had used some of the substance 
himself and had sold some. A certain amount of the substance was 
also confiscated from him. 
  The others receiving sentences on Tuesday were primarily 
heroin users. Their sentences varied from four months in prison 
to over one year. 
  According to the court, in 1992-93 Sjoblom trafficked 
narcotics that he obtained from an Espoo couple. This couple was 
considered to be the primary mover in the case, and they were 
sentenced two weeks ago. The man received nine years and his 
wife seven years in prison. 
  According to the court, this gang trafficked a total of 1.7 
kilos of heroin. Some of their drugs have been particularly 
strong and of good quality. According to Ritva Santavuori, the 
city prosecuting attorney, two persons have died because of 
overdoses from it.

<F P=106> [Article by Jarkko Sipila: "Many Kilos of Amphetamines </F>
Smuggled from Estonia"] 
  [Text] One shipment was brought from Tallinn in a small 
airplane. 
  In August of last year, 4 kg of amphetamines were brought to 
Helsinki from Estonia in a small airplane. The drugs were hidden 
in the airplane's space for the heating element. The narcotics 
were quite pure and valued at significantly more than a million 
markkas. 
  The smuggling incident is linked to the amphetamine case 
currently before the Helsinki Circuit Court, in which eight men 
are accused of aggravated narcotics smuggling, aggravated 
narcotics crimes, as well as other crimes. The case involves 7 
kg of amphetamines. Of that amount, 1.2 kg have been seized. 
  In connection with the case, the police have, in addition to 
the amphetamines, also seized 5 kg of hashish, tens of thousands 
of hormone pills and numerous guns, including a submachine gun. 
The gang involved, which operated in Finland, has had good 
connections in Estonia and Sweden. 
  According to the narcotics division of the Helsinki police 
department, a dozen more suspects will be indicted in connection 
with the case. The main suspect in the case has been arrested in 
Sweden. 
  During the course of police investigations, it was 
discovered 
that the gang was also planning to smuggle 12 kg of amphetamines 
into the country. The case also involved 10 automobiles, which 
had been stolen in Finland. The automobiles were taken to 
Estonia. 
  During interrogation the police discovered that members of 
the gang had been offered to act as middlemen in the sale of 
Kalashnikov assault rifles, Makarov handguns, hand grenades, and 
ammunition. The price of a Kalashnikov, to give an example, 
would have been 7,000 markkas. 
<H5>  Amphetamines Delivered From Hotel </H5>
  A 4-kg shipment was brought to the Malmi Airport on 3 
August. 
The previous day four men had flown to Tallinn in a rented small 
plane. There, the drugs were picked up from an Estonian dealer 
at Hotel Sport. 
  In the evening, the men celebrated at the Viru Hotel, and 
the 
next day all four men flew back to Malmi. 
  Two of the men are professional pilots; one from Helsinki 
and 
the other one from Riihimaki. The 29-year-old pilot from 
Helsinki told the police that they all were cognizant of drugs 
being smuggled. 
  The pilot from Riihimaki has, however, denied this. 
According 
to him, they were supposed to bring in hormones and not 
narcotics. A 31-year-old fireman from Helsinki, who also 
participated in the trip, has also denied any knowledge of the 
drugs. "I only went on the trip to party," he told the court 
last Wednesday [26 January]. 
  So far, the police have been unable to locate the fourth 
passenger on the airplane. 
  The police were able to seize less than half a kilogram of 
the total 4-kg shipment. The smugglers were able to sell the 
rest in, among other places, Helsinki and Oulu. 
  Public prosecutor Leena Metsapelto wants the smugglers to 
pay 
fines amounting to the value of the airplane, or 350,000 markkas. 
  Some 300 grams of the narcotics were found in an apartment 
in 
Riihimaki, where the amphetamines had been hidden at the request 
of the second pilot. Last Tuesday [25 January], the 28-year-old 
man from Riihimaki who had concealed the drugs was convicted of 
a narcotics crime, and sentenced to pay 80-day fines, or 1,600 
markkas. 
<H5>  Half a Kilo Found in Central Finland </H5>
  Through the main suspects, the case is also linked to 
another 
gang faction, from which half a kg of amphetamines have been 
seized. The drugs were found in a cottage in Toivakka, in 
central Finland. 
  Jorma Juhani Hypponen (39), who lived in the Rural District 
of Jyvaskyla and in Tallinn, was sentenced by the district court 
to four and a half years of imprisonment. 
  In addition to the seized narcotics, the court found him 
guilty of the distribution of half a kilo of amphetamines, as 
well as the attempt to smuggle 2 kg of the same drug. He was 
also convicted of theft, fencing, and a crime involving firearms. 
  Hypponen started to serve his sentence immediately after the 
verdict. As far as the other individuals charged were concerned, 
the court granted a two-week continuance.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Finnish Man Living in Belgium </F>
Accused of Smuggling 81 Kilos of Hashish"] 
  [Text] A 51-year-old Finnish man living in Belgium had 
charges of smuggling 81 kilos of hashish into Finland brought 
against him on Monday [20 January] in Helsinki City Court. 
According to the prosecutor, this automobile painter has on 
seven different occassions since 1990 brought hashish to Finland 
via Turku, Naantali, and Helsinki. At first the shipments were 3 
kilos in size, but the last shipment was 60 kilos. 
  Charges in the case have already been brought against more 
than 10 people, including the chief individuals in the so-called 
Ristiina Gang, among others. The case has been in court now for 
almost one year. The case has been at a standstill for half a 
year as the court awaited the extradition of the Finnish man who 
was arrested in Belgium. The automobile painter was arrested in 
April of 1993. 
  The automobile painter admitted on Monday that the charges 
were true in their main parts. The last charge, involving the 
60-kilo shipment, is not quite accurate, however, according to 
him, for, as his own version has it, he merely received the 
shipment here in Finland. He had no prior knowledge about the 
size of the shipment he was receiving. 
  Police have been able to seize over 50 kilos of hashish in 
connection with the case. Some of this was found on the property 
of one Ristiina businessman, the main defendant in the case, and 
some was found in a residence in Porvoo.

<F P=106> [Article by Katharina Frank: "Money Laundering by Mail; </F>
Turkish Dealers Are Bringing Their Assets Abroad, Disguising 
Them as the Earnings of Guest Workers"] 
  [Text] Hamburg, Lindenstrasse Post Office: a sinister 
individual with a plastic bag goes up to the window and empties 
a pile of crumpled bank notes into the opening. 
  "That is drug money!" protests a courageous postal customer 
waiting in line. 
  Caught. The man with the plastic bag loses his 
nerve, flees the room, and leaves behind 20,000 marks [DM]. 
  A little later, accomplices of the hindered depositor 
surround the post office on Lindenstrasse and one of them forces 
the branch chief to give back the money. 
  An untypical failure. Normally the money laundering on the 
Alster works very smoothly. What street dealers of the Turkish 
mafia deliver today is in the accounts of the drug clan beyond 
the Bosporus tomorrow. The police are powerless. 
  Sigmund Zwirn from the Hamburg Customs explains the money 
laundering system: "The drug money is paid into general accounts 
of Turkish banks agents at different post offices. These 
financial institutions themselves are not allowed to accept any 
cash. They just handle the clearance system and have nothing to 
do with drugs." 
  Advantage for the mafia: Whereas normal financial 
institutions check the identity of depositors with every foreign 
transaction, Turkish bank agents do not require this in the case 
of the so-called "guest worker money." 
  In this way, about DM240 million flows to Turkey every year 
from Hamburg alone and some DM50 million from Bremen. Sigmund 
Zwirn cannot say how much dirty money is involved there. He 
does, however, register an increase in the suspicious 
transactions. 
  "Formerly adolescents and asylum-seekers took sums as large 
as DM100,000 to the postal windows. Now, because of the new law 
on money laundering, the money couriers come only with amounts 
under DM20,000 but they come more often and accompanied by 
bodyguards. Or they hire Germans who handle the formalities for 
them." 
  Postal bankers do regret that the Yellow Giant is being 
misused by the Turkish drug mafia as a money laundering machine 
but they do not feel responsible. Postal bank spokeswoman 
Marianne Bork: "The legislators must give thought to these 
abuses, not us." 
  Other banks, other customs: When, for example, the 
Bremen Savings Bank learned two years ago from the customs 
search that drug money was being deposited at their windows as 
well, it immediately ended its relations with the Turkish bank 
agents. 
  The money laundering of the postal service is not the only 
way in which about a million a day in drug money reaches Turkey 
from Hamburg alone. 
  In Hamburg-Fuhlsbuettel, policewomen pulled a total of 
DM45,000 from the underwear of two Kurdish women in a check 
before their departing flight. Spicy is the fact that the women 
were flown in at the expense of the Justice Department to 
testify in the trial of a drug dealer.

<F P=106> [Article by Wilhelm Dietl: "The Hunters of Hot Goods; The </F>
Customs Office Is Fighting the Heroin Flood With Small, 
Effective Special Units"] 
  [Text] The red 36-ton DAF, loaded with Turkish sledge 
[reed-like grass] had almost passed through the customs 
checkpoint at the Bavarian-Czech border crossing of Furth im 
Wald, when the official was struck by something in the freight 
documents: Long-distance driver Turgut Oezkaya had taken 
suspiciously long between loading the truck and starting from 
Turkey and could not conclusively explain it. 
  Reason enough for an "overhaul," the toughest thing a truck 
pilot can experience in German customs. 
  Hard-boiled specialists from the S-unit (S as in Special 
Handling) board the suspicious truck, guide it to a remotely 
located corrugated metal building and roll up their sleeves, 
because what follows is a gruelling job. 
  First, the Turkish driver must remove the tarpaulin from the 
truck. The 41-year-old remains cool, obviously feeling quite 
certain even when the customs people remove his spare tires and 
examine them with special X-ray equipment. The tires of a 
transport vehicle have lots of room for smuggled goods. 
Oezkaya's tires are clean, however. 
  The Turk looks on impassively as S-unit chief Karl Neumann 
(name changed) has a drill and an endoscope brought over. The 
customs officers drill holes in inaccessible hollows in the 
body; insert the finger-thick, flexible rod with a lens and a 
light source; and illuminate the most hidden angles. Nothing. 
The driver's cab is lifted off. The special Furth unit, all of 
them expert truck technicians and familiar with the design 
features of each type of vehicle, tap the floor of the driver's 
cab, scrape at the protective underfloor coating. Bit by bit the 
gigantic rig loses its superstructures. 
  Hunting fever has seized the group. Drug investigator Alf, 
the supernose, enters the stage. Slowly and with concentration 
the hunting dog circles the partially disassembled truck, 
sniffing every square centimeter. 
  A game full of suspense for the four-legged creature. In his 
training he has learned to detect cleverly hidden heroin, 
cocaine, and hashish packages. Alf does not do his work just to 
please his master; a reward in the form of a beautiful piece of 
sausage also beckons. 
  Now that the dog is in the shed, Turgut Oezkaya for the 
first 
time shows signs of slight nervousness, which also does not 
escape the customs officers. 
  Alf is now at the left-hand of the two powerful diesel 
tanks; 
he hates the smell of the fuel, but even so he does not leave. 
He stretches his neck and inhales jerkily. 
  The men from the customs office merely exchange brief 
glances. One scratches with the screwdriver on the forward side 
of the tank. Under the paint some white putty compound becomes 
visible and under that the edge of a screwed-down cover, 
invisible from the outside. The same thing on the front of the 
truck tank on the other side. 
  The S-unit men remove 37 kilos of heroin from the two 
perfectly camouflaged chambers. Later, the investigators 
encounter a second hiding place with 54 kilos of heroin in the 
double floor of the sleeping cab. Here as well the cover placed 
on top had been carefully spackled and painted over. 
  The customs people regard the professional job with great 
respect. "I would like to meet the man who did that," says group 
leader Neumann. 
  Turgut Oezkaya does not reveal the name. Although he has 
just 
lost a drug shipment with a street value of more than 9 million 
German marks [DM], as well as his commission of an estimated 
DM60,000 and, further, the truck, he does not soften. 
  The interrogation remains fruitless. The truck driver names 
neither the sender of the hot freight nor its addressee. His 
only explanation he finally deigns to make is a purely 
obligatory act: "At a parking lot in Hungary I met an Iranian 
whom I did not know. He convinced me to smuggle caviar for him 
to Germany. I knew nothing about heroin." 
  Heribert Baumann of the Joint Narcotics Intelligence Group 
at 
the Bavarian Land Criminal Office and the Nuremberg Customs 
Investigative Office only dismisses that: "All drug smugglers 
provide such stories for the protocol, so that after their 
prison term in Germany they do not have to be tried once more in 
Turkey for narcotics smuggling." 
  Turgut Oezkaya still has a long time before his trip home. 
The large-scale smuggler, now sentenced to 13 years 
imprisonment, can be released at the earliest in six and a half 
years with good behavior. 
  A great success for the S-unit. The highly motivated 10-man 
group, one of 72 in the entire area of the FRG, is part of the 
customs elite and enjoys a reputation among insiders which is 
comparable to that of the GSG 9 [Border Patrol Squad] or the 
SEKs [Special Action Groups] in the police force. But unlike the 
tough troopers of the special squads, the customs specialists 
practically never appear in public. 
  Although the S elite in the Customs is exempted from general 
routine processing service and is able to operate quite 
independently, there is no successor generation. 
  Chief customs clerk Neumann mentions the reasons: "We do not 
earn more than our colleagues in the regular service, but are 
ready to be called in at any time of day or night. This means a 
large amount of overtime. Also, when we disassemble trucks we 
have to work really hard physically. That deters many 
applicants." 
  On occasion there is a great deal of conspiracy when the 
S-unit secretly follows detected contraband transports from the 
border to the destination in the country. This does not involve 
vodka and cigarettes, of course, but exclusively dangerous 
contraband: weapons and narcotics. 
  The results of the investigations are spectacular. For the 
area of the Nuremberg regional revenue office which is in charge 
and to which all crossings for the northern Balkan route belong, 
regional revenue office spokesman Wolfgang Zilk reports: "In 
1993, 832 kilograms of heroin were confiscated in all of 
Germany, more than 60 percent of which in our area. For hashish, 
a total of 3.3 tons, we found one-third." 
  It could be even more, if the S units founded five years ago 
could be reinforced to the same extent as the increase in the 
traffic from Bucharest, Budapest and Prague. But there the 
customs office is on the losing side. 
  "In December alone, 28,000 trucks came through here," says 
Neumann, leader of the Furth S-unit, "but we are only able to 
examine thoroughly a maximum of two." 
  Although this is hardly more than spot checks, the customs 
investigators always have astonishing success: They uncovered 
291 kilos of heroin on 4 December at Schirnding under a load of 
Turkish hazelnuts. And colleagues in Regensburg found another 57 
kilos of heroin on 13 January. Again, the hot goods were hidden 
on a Turkish nut transporter. 
  But between those the S-units often have painfully 
unsuccessful days and weeks as well. Then the S elite 
occasionally takes turns in the normal border-crossing traffic 
and catches a few minor Marlboro smugglers as training exercises. 
  In order for the frustration not to get too high, the Furth 
investigators set out once a year at their own expense on a 
"business excursion" to the opposite side. Then Neumann's men 
look around incognito and quite discreetly in the countries 
where the hemp and the red poppy grow.

  [Text] An International drug-trafficking ring which used 
the Evros River to smuggle large quantities of heroin and 
hashish from Turkey to Athens has been broken up after several 
months of surveillance by the police. 
  The gang, made up of two Iranians, one Turk and a Greek, had 
smuggled at least ten kilos of heroin to the country during the 
last five months. A tip-off led to a raid on a flat in 
Kalithea, southern Athens, and the members' arrest. The drug 
squad is still after other three alleged members of the gang. 
  The police confiscated 1.7 kilos of heroin, 704 grams of 
hashish and 11 grams of opium. 
  The 27-year-old Turk, who in 1991 had been arrested for 
drug-related offences, is thought to be the ring-leader. 
  In 1993, he was released from a Greek prison and deported. 
Using a false ID and documents, he returned to Greece and 
formed the gang. The arrested Greek is Dhimitrios Kolovos, aged 
37.

  [Text] Half of Greece's prison population is taking drugs, 
officials revealed in Athens yesterday. 
  New ways of fighting the ever-increasing drugs problem were 
discussed at the start of a three-day European Union [EU] 
conference on illegal drugs, held at Zappion Hall, Central 
Athens. 
  The opening day seminar was on drug-addicts and prisons. 
  Addressing representatives from all over Europe, European 
Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said the production and 
trafficking of hard drugs was an increasingly serious problem 
for Greece's neighbours. Mr. Pangalos joined in wide-spread 
allegations that The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
produces heroin. 
  "New networks of producing and processing drugs, heroin in 
particular, have developed in some countries that used to have a 
communist regime," he said. "Information is there, easy to be 
proved," he added, pointing at records of arrests that Greek 
authorities have had at their disposal during the last few years. 
  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis said that Greek law 
punishes drug traffickers but was unfair in how it treated drug 
addicts. He did not rule out the possibility of a future 
amendment to the law. "The issue of people taking drugs and the 
way of facing them remains open," said Mr. Kouvelakis. 
  According to data presented by Manolis Skoulakis, deputy 
health minister, over half the people detained in Greek prisons 
are on drugs. Mr. Skoulakis said that medical staff will soon 
be hired by all Greek jails in order to tackle the problem: "A 
model unit for the psychological rehabilitation of drug addicts 
will be founded in Khalkidhiki, in the near future." He added 
that "the purpose of the project, costing one billion drachmas, 
will be to face the needs of drug-dependent prisoners," 
stressing that it will function on a voluntary basis.

  [Text] Turin, Italy, March 8 (AFP) - The bosses of a major 
drugs ring escaped arrest after a record seizure of 5.5 tonnes 
of cocaine aboard a truck here, with only intermediaries 
arrested, police officials admitted Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The cocaine, smuggled in on a boat from Colombia in a banana 
cargo, was seized overnight Saturday. Police announced its 
seizure on Monday. 
  The drugs, with a street value of about 300 million dollars, 
were seized when a truck taking the cargo from the port of Genoa 
to a warehouse in a village near here was stopped on a road in 
northern Italy, police said. 
  In order to divert attention, the drugs traffickers had left 
the cargo in the warehouse for two months from its arrival 
before moving it, police said. 
  When the cargo was moved, the driver was joined in the cab 
by 
his three year old daughter and pet dog in order to allay the 
police's suspicions, officials said. 
  The seizure, a record amount in Europe, followed months of 
joint investigation by police in Milan and Genoa, Turin police 
said. 
  Twelve people were arrested during the operation, including 
several suspected Mafia members. Only two of the suspects were 
identified--Adrea Lia, 22, and Maurizio Lo Russo, 28, who had 
rented the warehouse where the cocaine was to have been 
delivered. 
  The drug was probably destined for sale outside Italy, in 
several other European countries. Inquiries are continuing in 
Switzerland, Germany and Lichtenstein. 
  Police said that the recent increases in frontier controls 
in 
areas bordering on the former Yugoslavia had pushed the drugs 
traffickers to use the Turin region as the major conduit for the 
drugs trade out of Italy. 
  "If the traffickers chose Turin as the base for the passage 
of such a quantity of the drug, that means that the mafia has 
the capacity in place to manage such a volume," a police source 
said. 
  It shows their heavy implantation into northern Italy, he 
added.

  [Text] National anti-mafia prosecutor Bruno Siclari was in 
Turin today to give details about the operation on Saturday that 
resulted in Italy's most important ever drug seizure. 
  Pure cocaine worth 300 billion lire was seized from several 
warehouses in the province of Turin in what was the largest 
anti-drug operation ever carried out in Italy against the South 
American drug-traffickers linked to the Mafia and the 
'Ndrangheta [Calabrian mafia]. 
  They had discovered a new way to transport vast quantities 
of 
cocaine to Italy by ship and long-haul vehicle. The mafia 
wanted to run its business from the old warehouses owned by 
small-time crooks at Borgaro in the province of Turin. 
Following 12 months of investigations, the anti-mafia 
investigative directorate under Siclari and Turin Chief Public 
Prosecutor Marcello Maddalena had the foot soldiers and heads of 
the organization arrested. The organization was to supply drugs 
to central Italy and eastern Europe. This is what Siclari said: 
  [Begin Siclari recording] This finding means that there is a 
definite link between Colombians and organized crime in Italy, 
because it is unthinkable that this amount of drugs would be 
sent if very solid links did not already exist. [end recording]

<H5>  Numbers </H5>
  Although it is impossible to calculate exactly the total 
volume of drugs circulating in Portugal annually, the yearly 
figures on seizures have been increasing appreciably. Whereas, 
during 1992, 6,400 kg of hashish were confiscated, in 1993 that 
number rose to 49,000 kg. However, 19 of those 49 tons were 
taken from containers discovered at sea, near the port of Ponta 
Delgada, on Ilha de Sao Miguel, in the Azores. 
  As for marijuana, the seizures tripled from one year to the 
next: from 8.5 kg in 1992 to 24 kg last year. The figures on 
cocaine declined, but this is nearly all explained by the fact 
that the confiscation of 1,800 of the 1,886 kg of cocaine seized 
in 1992 was due to a single operation to combat the 
international traffic. During 1993, the volume of cocaine seized 
was approximately 167 kg. In the case of heroin, the figure 
rose: 87 kg last year, versus 53 kg in 1992. As for 
barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquillizers/hypnotics, the 
annual confiscation numbers have not even exceeded hundreds of 
grams. It should be noted that the 1993 statistics for all drugs 
relate to the amounts tallied from January to November. 
<H5>  Major Confiscations </H5>
  The largest of the cocaine seizure operations resulted in 
the 
discovery of nearly 2 tons of the white powder in June 1992, 
when the PJ [Criminal Investigations Police] dismantled an 
international drug trafficking network in cooperation with 
several European police forces. This occurred along Cabo de Sao 
Vicente. 
  During one week of February 1993, the Criminal 
Investigations 
Police conducted two operations leading to the confiscation of a 
total of 26 kg of heroin in the Greater Lisbon area. This was 
the largest store of heroin seized last year. 
  During 1993, many hashish confiscations were made south of 
Setubal. In just nine operations, an equal number of tons was 
seized. In October of that year, the PJ in Setubal seized 8.5 
tons of hashish being transported on two TIR [International Road 
Transport] trucks on the Aguas de Moura-Pegoes highway. This was 
the largest hashish confiscation ever made on continental 
territory. 
<H5>  Red Zones </H5>
  In other words, these are districts overrun with vice and 
addiction. In Lisbon, the notorious Casal Ventoso should be 
carefully avoided. This claim is made by one who knows: Jacinto 
Meca, an ex-officer in charge of the PJ's Central Directorate 
for Drug Trafficking Investigation: "We conduct operations there 
almost every week. It's a difficult, complicated district, 
because it has its own very special connections for protection 
and complicity." It is also the area of the capital in which the 
largest number of needles can be found per square kilometer of 
roadways. Also in the capital area, Picheleira, Estoril's Fim do 
Mundo district, Olivais, and the vicinity of Damaia de Baixo are 
some of the convenient havens for drug addicts. In the north, 
the Porto districts of Cerco and Se are not advisable for anyone 
merely wishing to walk his little dog after 2200. 
<H5>  Consumers and Traffickers </H5>
  Prominent among the 1,899 consumers arrested in 1992 were 
465 
manual workers, 92 street vendors, 90 students, 40 female 
domestics, 34 public servants, and 400 without occupations. 
There were also musicians, paramedics, members of the military, 
and teachers, as well as a theatrical performer who was arrested 
for playing his part. Over half of those arrested lived in their 
parents' homes; 43 percent were unemployed, without children; 
and only 2 percent of the total lived in rural areas. Most of 
the drug addicts were aged between 16 and 45 years, and only 7 
percent of all those arrested were women. 
  There were all types among the 931 traffickers arrested in 
1992. The most significant figures indicate 228 manual workers, 
101 street vendors, and, once again, female domestics: 60 ladies 
faithfully devoted to the drug traffic. Of this group of persons 
arrested, 61 percent had received primary or preparatory 
schooling, and only 1 percent had reached the university level. 
There are foreigners for all tastes participating in the drug 
traffic. The majority are Brazilians, Venezuelans, and 
Spaniards, followed closely by Guineans, Cape Verdeans, and 
Angolans. 
  By November of last year, 1,209 traffickers had already been 
caught in the police trap, and 70 percent of them are in 
preventive custody. The municipalities in which this breed 
abounds are those of Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Loule, Faro, Porto, 
Gondomar, Lisbon, Loures, Oeiras, and Sintra. Anyone desiring 
drugs in Angra do Heroismo, Braganca, or Guarda has to sweat a 
little. They are the national municipalities in which the 
incidence of drug trafficking is slighter. However, crime 
sometimes compensates for this: at least until the criminal is 
caught. A few months ago, a female heroin trafficker operating 
in Casal Ventoso, and considered the leading one in the 
district, was arrested. This businesswoman's profits: 5,000 
contos per day. As for "superstars" of the Portuguese-style drug 
traffic, not many names are known; but there are enough to cause 
headaches for the forces of order. During the 1980's, the 
Galician clan of the Charlines and Laureano Oubina were the 
precursors for the landing of hashish on Portuguese shores. The 
Viriatos group, among those appearing in the newspapers, is the 
owner of one of the largest establishments for landing and 
transporting drugs to Galicia. Also known are sporadic links 
between small-scale Portuguese from the forest area and Sito 
Milanco's drug trafficking "super-gang." However, some months 
ago, one of Casal Ventoso's major traffickers was arrested: aged 
37, he was employed in the hotel business in his spare time, and 
had the code name "O Aleman" [The German]. 
<H5>  Informants </H5>
  The PJ has agents specializing in these activities, who 
sometimes infiltrate the gang of criminals itself. "We also 
receive anonymous reports, or information given in person. For 
example, it may come from someone who knows in detail what is 
going on in his district or area, and who considers it a good 
idea to give valuable information to the police. There have been 
instances in which the network of informants has crossed 
borders. During an investigation that ended in February 1993, 
the Criminal Investigations Police received the cooperation of 
two infiltrated agents from the Bundescriminalamt [(German) 
Federal Criminal Bureau]. As a result of the operation, over 
seven kg of cocaine were seized." 
<H5>  Shootings </H5>
  The death of a trafficker during an operation occurred only 
once in recent years. He drew his weapon, aiming at a policeman, 
and had to be brought down. Homicides: "One case directly linked 
to the drug traffic may have appeared within the past two 
years." Another known shooting took place during the October 
1993 operation: the one involving the 8.5 tons of hashish. In 
order to halt the suspects, the Criminal Investigations Police 
proceeded to fire a few shots, wounding a Galician 
"narco"-criminal in the leg. However, "the methodical, 
time-consuming manner in which our investigations are conducted 
doesn't give rise to large-scale shootings." This is fortunate, 
because seizures of hunting rifles, machine guns, and other 
heavy-caliber weapons are common. In the drug underworld there 
are "authentic weapons of war," as Jacinto Meca warns. 
<H5>  Parallel Businesses </H5>
  The most common is money laundering. There has been 
legislation in Portugal to combat it only since February 1993. 
The smuggling of gold or various types of equipment may also 
occur. It should be remembered that many of the national drug 
trafficking networks resulted from the reconversion of the 
traditional contraband networks. Prostitution, not a parallel 
business, is an old, faithful friend.

<F P=106> [Report by Kemal Yurteri: "Drug Trafficking Shifts to </F>
Ports"] 
  [Text] Ankara -- Developments in the Balkan countries and 
the Caucasus have forced the drug traffickers to make 
significant changes in the routes they use to transport their 
narcotics from Turkey to Western Europe and from Western Europe 
to North America. While narcotics were smuggled into Turkey from 
Iran and Syria in the past, the drug traffickers are also 
bringing in supplies from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan at the present time. It is common knowledge that 
they used the "Balkan route" to transport their narcotics to 
Europe in the past. However, the recent use of ports in drug 
trafficking has drawn attention. It has been reported that even 
the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has complied with the changes in 
transportation routes and moved to intensify its activities in 
Italy and Greece. 
  It has been ascertained that the new changes in routes have 
been prompted by the internal war in the former Yugoslavia and 
the transport of narcotic substances in TIR [Transit Highway 
International] trucks from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, 
Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan to Turkey through the Sarp border 
gate. The TIR trucks have established a new route between Turkey 
and Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, which are known as the 
"Golden Crescent" countries. 
  The Directorate of Smuggling and Intelligence Work Narcotics 
Department, which is affiliated with the General Directorate of 
Police, has drawn up a report on the recent changes in drug 
trafficking in the region. The report said that several drug 
trafficking organizations have intensified their activities in 
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan because 
they are close to the "Golden Crescent" countries. It also 
said: "The drug trafficking organizations in the Golden 
Crescent and the Golden Triangle (Laos, Thailand, and Burma) 
assign selected elements from the cocaine cartels in the United 
States and the terrorist organizations in Lebanon to supervise 
and control each and every stage of drug trafficking 
(production, transportation, and sale of drugs). An operation 
against drug trafficking in the United States has revealed that 
the Cali cartel assigned 40,000 men for the sale of cocaine in 
that country and even paid monthly salaries to each one of 
them." The report also drew attention to the possibility of 
international drug trafficking organizations cooperating with 
criminal groups in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Azerbaijan. 
  The report described Turkey as an important transit center 
for heroin and hashish trafficking in the world and noted that 
the Balkan route starts from Turkey for geographical reasons and 
stretches to North America. It said: "The political 
developments along that route have forced the drug traffickers 
to make certain changes. The fact that a large quantity of the 
narcotic drugs that were impounded in Europe in the latter part 
of the 1980's was smuggled through the Balkan route drew the 
attention of the officials at the time. The Interpol General 
Secretariat established the "Pro-Balkan Unit" within the 
framework of the Interpol sub-committee on drug trafficking. 
The unit was established in accordance with the proposal the 
Yugoslav delegation made in the Interpol General Assembly 
meeting in 1989." 
  Drug traffickers used five routes to transport their 
narcotics through the Balkan region in the past. The narcotic 
substances brought to Turkey from the Golden Crescent countries 
and Lebanon were transported to other countries from: 
  1. Kapikule border gate in Edirne to Kapitan Andreevo in 
Bulgaria; Gradina, Yugoslavia; Spielfeld, Austria; Bad 
Reichenhall, Federal Germany, and other areas in Western Europe. 
  2. Ipsila to Kipoi [as published] and Borogodiko [as 
published] in Greece; Trieste, Italy; and other areas in Western 
Europe. 
  3. Istanbul to Sofia, Bulgaria; Bucharest, Romania; 
Budapest, Hungary; Prague, Czechoslovakia; Waidhaus [as 
published] in Federal Germany; and other areas in Western Europe. 
  4. Istanbul to Sofia, Bulgaria; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; 
Budapest, Hungary; Prague, Czechoslovakia; Furth im Wald [as 
published] in Federal Germany; and other areas in Western Europe. 
  5. Istanbul to Sofia, Bulgaria; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Graz, 
Austria; and other areas in Western Europe. 
  The changes in the routes the drug traffickers used as a 
result of the fragmentation of Yugoslavia, through which 
Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Karadag, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
Slovakia have emerged as independent countries, are as follows: 
  1. From Derince, Turkey to Trieste, Italy and other parts of 
Western Europe. 
  2. From Haydarpasa in Istanbul to Constanta, Romania; 
Budapest, Hungary; Bratislava, Slovakia; Prague, the Czech 
Republic; Germany; and other parts of Western Europe. 
  3. From Edirne, Turkey to Sofia, Bulgaria; Bucharest, 
Romania; Budapest, Hungary; Bratislava, Slovakia; Prague, the 
Czech Republic; Germany; and other parts of Western Europe. 
  4. From Kapikule, Turkey to the Port of Patras, Greece; 
Trieste, Bari, and Brindisi, Italy; Switzerland; France; and 
other parts of Western Europe. 
  5. Kapikule, Turkey to Thessaloniki, Greece; Trieste; Bari; 
and Brindisi, Italy; Switzerland; France; and other parts of 
Western Europe. 
  6. From Kapikule, Turkey to Sofia, Bulgaria; Bucharest, 
Romania; Budapest, Hungary; Vienna, Austria; and Rome, Italy. 
  Regarding the PKK, the report said: "It has been ascertained 
that the PKK will maintain its underground activities, intensify 
its drug trafficking operations, take harsh steps to continue to 
extort funds, and shift its activities from wherever it is 
banned to neighboring countries (particularly to those that have 
a coastline). The obstruction of PKK's activities in the 
countries in which that organization is banned will be 
impossible if its members are not expelled." 
  The report also drew attention to the shifting of drug 
trafficking operations to Italy and Greece, which are on the 
shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

  [Text] The leader of a drug smuggling gang who attempted to 
import Bolivian cocaine with an estimated street value of 
&pound;28 
million was jailed for 25 years yesterday. 
  Bristol Crown Court was told how Jamaican-born Derek Gregory 
had organised the smuggling of more than 100 lb of the drug in 
gift-wrapped packages inside four passenger suitcases at 
Stansted airport in July 1992. 
  Customs and Excise officers moved in as the suitcases were 
being brought through the "nothing to declare" channel. The haul 
was the largest seizure of drugs in passenger luggage in Britain. 
  Gregory's half-brother, Ernest Ford, 33, was jailed for 12 
years and Lee Cameron, 22, for 13 years, for their part in the 
scheme to bring cocaine into Britain. Gregory, 26, from 
Paddington, west London, showed little emotion as he left the 
dock after being sentenced. 
  Judge McCarraher, passing sentence, said the court knew well 
the evils of cocaine, "which destroys people's lives and their 
families, and produces crime among those who want to use it and 
obtain it illegally." 
  Gregory and Ford, both of Streatham, southwest London, and 
Cameron, of Bristol, were convicted last month on a joint charge 
of conspiring with others to smuggle cocaine. 
  The court was told Ford was the "minder," watching over the 
arrival of the drug consignment. Cameron was described as "the 
recruiter," seeking out young jobless men in and around Bristol 
and offering all expenses-paid trips to South America. The 
would-be couriers were told they would be smuggling diamonds. 
  Three co-accused who brought the suitcases through Customs 
were cleared of conspiracy charges. They said they believed they 
were smuggling precious stones. 
  Gregory, known as "the Boss" by his associates, had led an 
"international jetset lifestyle" visiting known drug locations 
in Africa, India, South America and the U.S. He was deported 
from Britain in 1989, having served a two-year sentence for 
smuggling cannabis.

  [Text] The illicit drugs culture, once the preserve of 
Britain's inner cities, has extended its influence. The country 
cousins of streetwise metropolitan youths are experimenting with 
cannabis, Ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines. 
  In the market towns and cathedral cities of England's 
shires, 
an underground distribution network has evolved which makes most 
substances available. 
  Michael Levi, professor of criminology at the University of 
Wales in Cardiff, said that recognition of drug offending was 
"quite low" in the countryside, because statistics depended on 
the amount of police activity. "It is invisible, because drugs 
squads aren't so likely to operate in rural areas," he said. 
  One of the few studies took place in East Sussex, where 
2,047 
schoolchildren were questioned last year at a cost of 
&pound;16,000. The Home Office paid most of the bill. Researchers 
discovered that a fifth of all pupils aged 14 and 15 had tried 
an illicit drug. The proportion was broadly the same in rural 
and urban areas. Boys were more involved than girls. 
  "It is prevalent, it is accessible. Anybody can get it if 
they want to," Rosalind Turner, who worked on the study with 
East Sussex Drugs Advisory Council, said. Children were 
arranging deliveries of drugs to their villages from telephone 
booths, "almost like dialling a pizza," she said. 
  Magic mushrooms and veterinary tranquilisers are more 
commonly abused in the countryside, according to the addiction 
charity Release. Cannabis has become as common in rural villages 
as in the inner cities, and while cocaine's popularity is 
spreading, crack is only occasionally brought to the 
countryside. East Anglia has a problem of amphetamine abuse. 
  Particular health problems arise from the abuse of drugs in 
the shires. Addicts may have to travel long distances for 
advice, or to receive regular supplies of methadone. Those who 
inject drugs live long distances from the nearest exchange point 
supplying clean needles, vital to prevent the spread of HIV. 
  The highest rate of drugs seizures in Britain according to 
latest figures, (for 1992) is in Greater London (2,849 per 
million population). In England, the other highest counties are 
Merseyside (1,962), Wiltshire (1,621) and Gloucestershire 
(1,428). Scotland has a high rate of drugs seizures, 
particularly in Strathclyde (1,966), Central (1,640), Lothian 
and Borders (1,586), and Tayside (1,576). In Wales, Dyfed-Powys 
has the highest rate of drugs hauls (1,646). 
  THE TIMES visited three of England's ancient shires, 
Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, to discover how 
widespread drug use has become.

<F P=106> [Article by Alan Travis, Home Affairs Editor] </F>
  [Text] Magistrates yesterday joined the growing opposition 
to the decision by the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, to 
increase the maximum fine for possession of cannabis and other 
soft drugs from &pound;500 to &pound;2,500. 
  Rosemary Thomson, Magistrates' Association chairman, said in 
a statement to Mr Howard: "The fact of the matter for sentencers 
is that few cases of possession reach the magistrates' courts. 
Police seem to be cautioning or doing nothing about possession 
for personal use." 
  The magistrates joined the police and drug counsellors in 
criticising the decision as having little impact on the problem 
of drug abuse. 
  Latest Home Office figures show that [the] majority of those 
dealt with by the police for possession of class B drugs, which 
includes cannabis and amphetamines, are cautioned. 
  About 22,000 of the 41,352 cases arising in 1992 were dealt 
with by a caution and never reached court. About 10,000 
defendants were fined for possession, with the average fine 
working out at &pound;86. Only 365 people were fined more than 
&pound;200 for possession, and of these only 52 were given the 
maximum fine. 
  Current sentencing guidelines for magistrates suggest that 
&pound;180 is the appropriate fine for offences of "average 
seriousness" in this category. The amount of cannabis found in 
possession of the defendant is a key determinant of the level of 
the fine. 
  Mr Howard yesterday defended the decision to include the 
change in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament. 
  "All we are doing is increasing the maximum level of the 
fine 
in line with other maximum fine levels which have been increased 
over the years," he said. The level of soft drug fines had been 
unchanged since 1977. 
  "Magistrates will take into account the means of the people 
who come before them in deciding where to pitch the level of the 
fine in any particular case." 
  He said that the &pound;2,500 maximum was necessary to 
allow the 
courts to impose a heavy penalty where the quantity seized was 
so large it was believed that the defendant had intended to be a 
supplier but it had been too difficult to prove. 
  Mike Goodman, director of Release, the national drug 
counselling agency, said he was alarmed by the Home Secretary's 
last suggestion. "That is fining people for crimes that have not 
been proved." 
  Mr Goodman added that no single British authority on drugs 
or 
law enforcement had suggested that increasing the penalties was 
the way to deal with the growing problem of drugs misuse. 
  Michael White adds: With a week to go before MPs vote on the 
homosexual age of consent, Downing Street last night rejected 
suggestions that Mr Howard's move to raise drugs fines was 
sending voters a signal of an anti-permissive kind. "It's an 
entirely separate issue," said a spokesman.

<F P=106> [Article by Ian Burrell and Mathew Loup] </F>
  [Text] The scene confronting the detective as he clambered 
into the loft was one that is becoming increasingly common in 
the bedrooms and garden sheds of Britain. The room was bathed in 
fierce lights, stiflingly hot, and crammed with thriving 
marijuana plants. 
  Paul Eden, of Crawley, West Sussex, was jailed for 12 months 
last year after he was found cultivating cannabis at home. 
High-powered bulbs threw heat and light off white-washed walls 
onto the rows of plants, which were bedded into heated tanks and 
fed by a continuous water supply. The room was strung with lines 
on which buds gently dried. 
  Police say that such sophisticated set-ups are thriving 
across Britain. The home-grown operations of the old hippie 
generation, hampered by a damp climate and lack of technical 
expertise, have been replaced by a new wave of growers using 
high-tech methods. 
  Seizures of cannabis plants more than trebled in 
Northamptonshire last year; in the West Midlands, one smoker was 
found to have grown 45 kilos of the drug at his allotment near 
Walsall. This month detectives found a cannabis "factory" in a 
twelfth-floor flat in a Glasgow block. In West Yorkshire, seven 
"skunk farms"--named after a powerful marijuana strain developed 
in Holland for home-growing--have been closed down since the 
beginning of 1993. 
  Much of the merchandise involved in the production of 
marijuana is openly advertised, promoted and sold in Britain. At 
Tower Records in London, books giving detailed instructions on 
growing cannabis are on sale. For &pound;9.99, customers can 
purchase The Closet Cultivator, "written by the foremost expert 
of cannabis cultivation". 
  Seeds of new cannabis varieties--such as Super Skunk, Silver 
Haze and Big Bud--are marketed from Holland in glossy brochures 
giving descriptions of their potency, yield, growing time and 
price. "Possession of the seeds is not illegal so there is not a 
lot we can do about it," said a customs spokesman. 
  In Viz, the top-selling comic popular with students, a crude 
drawing of a Rastafarian is used to illustrate an advertisement 
for "home-grown pot plants." It is not just students that police 
find tending their cannabis plants. Alan Derrett, 70, a former 
Rolls-Royce engineer, was given a conditional discharge earlier 
this month after telling a Bristol court that the 36 cannabis 
plants in his garden were to combat his "hypertension." 
  Release, the legal and drug advice agency, has received an 
unprecedented number of calls from people seeking help after 
being raided by police for cultivating cannabis. "They are 
saying, `this is my private life and the law has no place in it 
because it is not harming other people,'" said Alisdair Cant, a 
spokesman. 
  Police officers are less convinced, however. Paul Kyberd of 
the Thames Valley drug squad, warned of the potency of the new 
cannabis strains. "One guy said he inhaled skunk and it was just 
like a great big wave, almost knocking him over." 
  The growth in cannabis production coincides with a fierce 
debate over penalties for drug offences. In Scotland, the 
government is considering bringing in fixed penalties for 
cannabis possession that would not lead to a criminal record. 
  THE SUNDAY TIMES revealed last week that Michael Howard, the 
home secretary, is planning to increase the fine for possession 
of cannabis five-fold to &pound;2,500 in England and Wales.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "`Gold' Moves Into Turkestan"] </F>
  [Text] Tashkent -- At the end of last year, an Afghan 
merchant by the name of M. Khafizullo [name as transliterated] 
was arrested in Termez. On investigation, 24 kilograms of raw 
opium were discovered in a large travel bag in his Mitsubishi 
Galant car concealed in 56 chewing gum boxes [upakovka]. A 
recent trial sentenced the drug pusher to eight years. 
  In the last two years the law-enforcement bodies of the 
Central Asian republics have been encountering the problem of 
the large-scale transit through Turkestan of Afghan opium, known 
among junkies as "gold." It is distinguished by its sharp odor, 
which can be "sniffed out" by specially trained dogs even after 
several months. Another of its "attributes" is that it is 
cheap. In the province of Kunduz, bordering Tajikistan, the 
asking price is just $50 for a kilogram of opium. Moreover, it 
is possible to pay with metal crockery, soap, and tools. But 
upon crossing, say, to Bishkek, a "legitimate hit"--as a 
three-gram dose of opium is known in junkie-speak--can cost as 
much as R3,000. While in Moscow, the price soars to at least 
three times as much again. 
  According to data from the Uzbek National Security Service, 
Afghanistan dumped roughly 650 tonnes of opium on the drugs 
black market last year. This is a rise of 50 percent in 
comparison with 1992. Analysts link this directly with the 
civil war in Tajikistan. 
  But it is Gornyy Badakhshan, controlled to a significant 
degree by drugs mafia paramilitary formations, which has become 
the veritable gateway. From here, the opium makes its way via 
the Sarytash pass to neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Thousands of local 
inhabitants, deprived at times of the basic means of survival, 
are involved in the criminal business. The "stuff" is 
transported under piles of sheepskins, in spare tires, and, more 
frequently, in metal tubes fitted with magnets which can be 
fastened to the undersides of vehicles. 
  The largest haul of "stuff" fell to the credit of Uzbek 
customs officers. They "stumbled across" 13 tonnes of narcotics 
dispatched in raisin containers from an Afghan trading firm to 
Belgium and Canada. 
  Turkestan itself, which since time immemorial has been and 
indeed remains the largest supplier of drugs to the ex-USSR, 
entices Afghan drugs barons only as a convenient corridor for 
transferring opium to Russia and Europe. The transparency of 
the CIS borders merely serves their purposes. And this is why, 
according to I. Abdullayev, an official staffer of the Uzbek 
National Security Service, the former Soviet republics' 
law-enforcement bodies have no other option but to restore 
severed contacts immediately and together to forge a shield to 
deter a very real threat.

<F P=106> [Kamil Bayalinov article under the "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA </F>
Investigation" rubric: "Syringes in the Veins of Central Asia. 
Drugs Mafia Already Controls Part of Local Administrative 
Apparatus. What Will Happen Tomorrow?"] 
  [Text] During the long, tedious journey lasting several 
hours, the child wrapped in a pique quilt did not utter a sound. 
This alerted the suspicions of the passengers traveling with the 
mother clutching her child firmly to her breast. At the next 
stop, in the middle of the mountain ravine linking Issyk-Kul to 
the Chuya Valley, people mentioned this to the militia patrol 
lazily watching the rare passing cars. 
  "Citizen, come here please!" 
  The child turned out to be dead. Several kilograms of opium 
in a cellophane packet were found in its little stomach sewn 
with the usual unbleached threads. 
  This incident occurred in the late sixties, when Soviet 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] was one of the world's main suppliers of 
raw opium used for narcotics.... 
  In 1973, under pressure from the United Nations, the USSR 
Council of Ministers adopted the decision to destroy Kirghizia's 
[Kyrgyzstan's] poppy plantations, and the laurels of "narcotics 
champion" in the region passed to Afghanistan. In their search 
for money to buy weapons and food, the eternally warring Afghans 
all became involved in the lucrative drugs business to a man. 
Caravans loaded with opium travelled to Pakistan and from 
there, via Iran, to Europe and America. According to data 
supplied by the UN International Narcotics Control Committee, 
Afghanistan supplied the black market with as much as 200 tonnes 
of opium per year. 
  "What are the results of the three-year civil war in 
Afghanistan? With the Soviet troops' departure, Afghanistan has 
become an even more fragmented state with a large number of 
appanage princes. The size of their principalities depends on 
the number of their antitank grenade launchers, Kalashnikov 
rifles, tanks, and other weapons intended to defend the opium 
poppy plantations against competitors and rivals." (Taken from 
Kyrgyz Defense Ministry Main Intelligence Directorate documents). 
  There was the scent of big money in the fresh mountain air: 
Every dollar invested in the drugs business yielded a net profit 
of $12,000! The "golden crescent"--the not easily accessible 
region at the point where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
and Iran meet--prospered for many years, and the battle against 
the drug pushers was unsuccessful. 
  Only the Iranian Islamic revolution really "finished off" 
the 
drug pushers. Dealers and the men on the caravan trail had 
their heads cut off, were impaled, or were shot without any 
warning. The threat worked, especially as the guardians of the 
Islamic revolution did not rely solely on punitive measures, but 
built thick concrete walls on the routes taken by the drugs 
caravans through the narrow, virtually inaccessible ravines. 
The black market in drugs withdrew into itself, swelling up 
with the increased stocks of raw opium. Afghanistan began to 
work for its own consumption, occasionally shooting through 
individual consignments of drugs to China, Pakistan, and 
Tajikistan. But then the political and economic chaos in 
Tajikistan smashed the last barrier, and opium poured into the 
CIS at the speed of a spring flood. 
  "Opium is brought into Almaty and Bishkek by people from 
other cities, dragging their `camels' with them, that is, their 
wives or lovers. As a `bribe,' they try to `flog' the opium 
wholesale, without entering into any unnecessary discussions. 
Sometimes they are ripped off by zealous middlemen--Chechens and 
gypsies, who prefer to earn their living that way. None of them 
are `hooked' themselves. That is left to the small fry--the 
dealers whose job it is to parcel the product into one-gram 
polythene packets. One such dose costs $10-12. 
  "That is how 10-12 `bucks' disappear each day. The following 
morning it starts all over again." (The statements cited above 
and further below are revelations by Dr. Nazaraliyev's "opium" 
patients, who have either been cured or are undergoing treatment 
at his clinic). 
  The Osh-Khorog route is the only road linking mountainous 
Tajikistan to the "outside world." Thus, southern Kyrgyzstan is 
gradually becoming the main transit base of the world drug 
trade. Raw opium is "stashed" in the wheels of heavy freight 
vehicles or hidden (after first being sealed in polythene) in 
gasoline and fuel tanks. It is possible that the latest 
technology is also used: The opium is dissolved in gasoline and 
the neat product is subsequently separated out--admittedly with 
some weight loss. Last year, Kyrgyz task forces reduced drug 
pushers' income by more than 100 kg. Considering that, 
according to the statistics, only 10 percent of drug dealers are 
caught, the remaining 90 percent successfully convey their 
commodity to the points of sale. At least 900 kg of expensive 
narcotics passed through Kyrgyzstan in 1993. But how much 
really passed through? Apparently no one knows. 
  In winter, the Osh-Khorog route comes to a standstill. As a 
rule, during this period consignments of "dope" are concentrated 
in Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan region, and sometimes they are 
refined into top-grade heroin. According to the current 
information of a well-known department, a Pamir Tajik known by 
the nickname.... At this point, however, security officers 
warned me: 
  "If you give out his name, at best your correspondents' 
office will be blown up one night. He can reach you wherever 
you are." 
  Generally speaking, people involved in the battle with the 
drugs business try to avoid "sharp corners." First, it could 
hamper the success of a forthcoming operation and, second, the 
drugs trade network extends right up to the top.... 
  So, this Tajik controls a substantial proportion of the 
heroin trade in Tajikistan. He has his own armed detachment, 
raw material suppliers, and laboratories. In winter, 
intermediaries find dealers, study supply routes, and bribe 
customs officials, border guards, and militiamen. Considering 
state employees' official salary, a certain amount of risk could 
bring them prosperity for many years, if not for the rest of 
their lives. 
  Opium does not linger long in Kyrgyzstan's Osh Oblast. Some 
of it is taken through a "chink" in the Tian Shan Mountains to 
Bishkek in northern Kyrgyzstan, and from there to Almaty. 
Sometimes a consignment is carried by pilots, who exploit their 
contacts in the militia. A State Motor Vehicle Inspection 
Administration checkpoint recently confiscated 1.6 kg of opium 
from a local pilot near Osh Airport. 
  "If you inject yourself with drugs once, you inject yourself 
again. It is very hard to cope with the withdrawal symptoms. 
After a month, the needle will no longer go into the veins of 
your arms. That leaves the veins of your neck. But they also 
close over, trying to escape the needle. Then you move on to 
the veins of your legs and groin. Your sexual organ is your 
last hope. You have had it after that." 
  The opium route could only be closed by closing the 
Osh-Khorog road and simultaneously building a dam on the River 
Pyandzh. Kitted out with inflated inner tubes, death-defying 
drug pushers frequently swim across. But even this would not 
guarantee success. A militiaman would have to be posted in 
every mountain ravine. Plus someone to check that he is not 
bribed or murdered. A helicopter would have to be "hung" over 
every mountain pass, and everyone and everything in the area 
would have to be doused in lead and napalm. That would do the 
trick. 
  The Americans try to solve these problems peacefully, 
although it is true that they do not disdain to use punitive 
measures. The episode with Noriega is an example. The United 
States still pays substantial compensation to the peasants of 
Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia to ensure that they do not grow 
coca, from which cocaine is synthesized. The thrifty Americans 
initiated these payments for good reason. Once they took a 
false step: They terminated the payments and used the money to 
destroy the coca plantations. The response was swift. The 
Peruvians rose against the "gringos," virtually flying the flag 
of Fidel Castro. 
  So it is with the Pamirs. No punitive measures will succeed 
when nine out of 10 citizens can barely make ends meet and when 
every adult male sleeps with a gun at his side to protect 
himself against enemies.... 
  The only solution is to throw all forces and resources into 
compensating the people of the Pamirs in exchange for a pledge 
to give up the drugs business. Kyrgyzstan cannot cope with this 
alone. It will require the efforts of all the CIS countries, 
drawn into the "golden triangle" by the will of fate, and of 
Russia in particular. 
  If we wait a few years, it will be impossible to deal with 
the drugs mafia. It already controls part of the Kyrgyz (not to 
mention the Tajik) administrative apparatus. Tomorrow, in 
elections to a professional parliament, when the fate of every 
candidate will depend directly on the thickness of his wallet, 
the mafia could simply take over the legislative body. What 
cannot be bought with money can be bought with very big money. 
  Drug addiction, even addiction to opium, is curable. Dr. 
Nazaraliyev's drugs center is an example. However, we should 
tackle the essence of this social phenomenon, rather than the 
consequences. 
  For the moment, more often than not we try to catch the 
small 
fry: the dealers, the carriers, and the hapless drug addicts 
themselves. This creates the appearance of activity. Although 
even that is something. 
  Would you agree?

Kyrgyzstan, together with an 18-year-old girl from Novosibirsk, 
were living in an apartment they were renting on 
Krasnobogatyrskaya Street [Moscow]. The threesome was busted in 
the actual apartment, where 1.2 kilograms of opium were stored.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Andreyev, IZVESTIYA: "Tell Me What You Are </F>
Smuggling and I Will Tell You What Country You Are From"] 
  [Excerpts] According to Valeriy Draganov, deputy 
chairman of the State Customs Committee, the standard procedure 
for importing consumer goods and exporting valuable strategic 
resources in our country is as follows: Using all means 
possible, criminals obtain documents that describe a certain 
commodity as something entirely different. The licensed product, 
for instance, fuel or some metals--primarily nonferrous or rare 
earth--are usually documented as other items that may be 
exported without any restrictions. The documents, 
understandably, appear quite flawless, thanks to the corrupt 
officials of many agencies, including some customs and law 
enforcement offices. Fakes may be discovered either at an early 
stage when the goods start their long journey to the border, or 
at the border itself, through a complete examination of all 
cargo. 
  The trick with liquor, huge quantities of which are being 
brought here from Western Europe, is quite typical. In order to 
avoid paying a considerable excise tax, owners of the Royal 
exotic fruit liqueurs and various vodkas bottle them in 
innocent-looking lemonade containers. Aware of the fact that 
convoys from, say, Germany are being kept under observation by 
Russian customs and their foreign colleagues, they indicate a 
false final destination in Russia in the documents; in most 
cases it is a private residence. Customs operations officers 
check the address and find some drunken apartment owner who has 
no idea of the cargo he is supposed to receive. According to 
Draganov, it has been known to happen that such an addressee 
would call the Customs Committee after such a visit and beg them 
tearfully to put him in jail or, he assured them, he will simply 
be killed. One way or another the commodity, without reaching 
the declared addressee, is bottled once again, this time in its 
"own" container, and then dispensed to trade facilities. 
[passage omitted] 
  In Draganov's estimation, the worst situation can be found 
at 
the Russia-Kazakhstan border. It is occurring more and more 
often in this area that smugglers are resorting to arms when 
breaking through the border from Russia to adjacent territory. 
Here is the maneuver they normally use: A truck rushes by at top 
speed while somebody in it sprays customs officers with machine 
gun and submachine gun fire; it breaks through the barriers and 
disappears into Kazakhstan. Goods carried there include 
automotive parts, metals, petroleum products, jewelry, gold 
items, furs, ordinary consumer goods. The first 10 armored cars 
being manufactured by the GAZ [Gorky Motor Vehicle Works] for 
the State Customs Committee will be assigned to this particular 
section of the Russian border. 
  Committee reports cite more and more violent actions 
directed 
against customs offices and officers. One hundred and twenty 
such cases were recorded last year, from the murder of a customs 
officer's wife and children near Novorossiysk to terrorizing and 
coercion to suicide. Quite recently, in early February, a 
Dagestani official of the Russian customs was shot dead in his 
home. 
  The State Customs Committee has fully utilized the new 
provisions of the Russian Customs Code which allow it, among 
other things, to conduct independent investigative activity. 
Valeriy Draganov, who is in charge of the antismuggling work, 
told us that in one year they formed customs security subunits 
and rapid deployment groups based in Moscow and Rostov, the 
Urals and the Far East. They have their own aircraft, superior, 
state-of-the-art weapons, bullet-proof vests, and communications 
equipment. They conduct their operations either independently or 
in conjunction with the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FSK] and Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]; in their combat 
and other qualifications they are on the par with Alfa or Vityaz. 
  The old headache of Russian customs, drug smuggling made a 
threatening reappearance last year. Illegal drug trafficking did 
not just grow but exploded. The number of arrests in 1993 was 
3.5 times that of 1992, and the weight of confiscated drugs 
increased 5.5 times. This was the first time that a diplomatic 
cover was used for this kind of contraband. This was also the 
first time that Russian customs officers seized several large 
shipments of an especially strong drug KAT. 
  Another noticeable change has occurred in what can be termed 
the nomenclature of smuggled drugs. If hashish accounted for 
most confiscated substances before 1990, since 1991 first place 
has taken by poppy straw. Of 2,408 kilos of narcotics 
confiscated last year, poppy straw and marijuana made up 1,070.8 
and 153.5 kilos respectively. I would like to mention that these 
goods came to Russia from the Baltics, especially Lithuania, in 
the first half of the year, and from Ukraine during the second 
half. Moreover, of the entire 1,070.8 kilos seized last year, 
558 kilos of poppy straw were seized in December alone. 
  State Customs Committee analysts have also noticed a jump in 
the number of cases of confiscation of heroin and cocaine coming 
from the far abroad. In February of this year alone, 1,090 kilos 
of cocaine were seized, almost half the entire drug catch in 
1993. Here is one more curious circumstance: Women are becoming 
carriers of narcotics more and more often. The number of women 
carriers in the past year was more than five times that of the 
previous years... 
  Valeriy Draganov assured us that the customs service has 
considerably matured during the last 12-18 months; it has been 
given new rights, equipment, and infrastructure. However, we 
should not expect a sharp change in our fight against drug 
traffickers, who are acting more and more brazenly. The causes 
that breed all types of crime and corruption, which can also be 
found among customs officials, remain with us.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Viktor Artemenko: "Shady Dealings </F>
With Red Poppies"] 
  [Text] Smolensk -- The task force burst into the "den" 
late one evening. Although the occupants had not been expecting 
the uninvited guests, they did not give up without a fight. The 
militia had to use their weapons, and the head of the gang 
dealing in "grass" was wounded. Members of the task force found 
25.7 kg of poppy stems in the apartment. It is not hard to 
calculate how much money Nikolay T. and his partners in crime 
were expecting to make, if they were selling glasses of dried 
stems at 15,000 rubles [R] apiece. The gang of criminals was 
arrested and an investigation is now underway. 
  Once far removed from the problems of drug addiction, 
Smolensk Oblast has lately come into contact with them in real 
earnest. It has reached the stage where last year the oblast 
internal affairs administration was forced to set up a special 
subdivision to combat illegal drug trafficking. Together with 
other internal affairs bodies, it has brought to light some 700 
drug-related crimes. It is no joke: This represents a virtual 
fourfold increase in comparison with 1992. Some 223.5 kg of 
poppy stems and more than six kg of marijuana have been 
confiscated from drug addicts. 
  It would be naive to link the growth in these indicators 
purely with the militia's increased efforts, although its 
activity on this front has undoubtedly expanded. 
  "The reason for the wave of drug addiction is that Smolensk 
Oblast is now a border oblast," Militia Major General V. 
Vorobyev, head of the internal affairs administration, believes. 
"The oblast is becoming a staging post for the movement of raw 
narcotics from the south and west into the heart of Russia. 
Signs of this serious phenomenon are already apparent. In our 
oblast alone, seven emissaries carrying raw narcotics from other 
former Soviet republics and regions of Russia have been arrested 
lately; 13 percent of the confiscated raw narcotics entered the 
region from outside the Russian Federation." 
  The fabulous profits made by the Russian drugs business are 
thoroughly bound up with the socioeconomic problems that have 
brought people face to face with unemployment and poverty and 
smashed young people's spiritual core. It is no accident that, 
of those caught illegally trafficking drugs, 2.6 percent are 
juveniles, some 39 percent are young people under the age of 30, 
and more than 44 percent are neither working nor studying. 
Almost all have a secondary education. 
  The oblast's internal affairs bodies and public health 
services now have 350 drug users on their books, 260 of whom are 
inveterate drug addicts, as well as 175 users of toxic 
substances. Drug addiction is closely linked to crime. In the 
process of investigating drug addicts' illegal activities, 
members of the internal affairs administration subdivision to 
combat illegal drugs trafficking have uncovered four cases of 
robbery with violence, some 30 apartment burglaries, several 
thefts of state property, 12 cases of extortion, 10 cases of 
forged medical prescriptions, and other crimes. 
  They were all committed for the same purpose: To get money 
to buy lethal substances. For example, drug addicts Murashkin, 
Koryagin, and the Mamchur brothers have committed 10 apartment 
burglaries in Smolensk and other cities in the oblast. Last 
year, members of the internal affairs administration subdivision 
to combat illegal drugs trafficking discovered 12 dens used for 
taking drugs. Homes and lodgings where both the husband and 
wife, children, and other relatives have become drug addicts are 
often turned into dens. In Smolensk alone, for example, the 
militia has established the existence of five married couples 
and five pairs of brothers all addicted to drugs. 
  Problems relating purely to the militia are becoming 
glaringly obvious as the battle against illegal drug trafficking 
intensifies. First of all, special subdivisions working in this 
field must be set up in the oblast's rayon centers and major 
cities. The potential of the expert criminology department 
should be expanded, particularly with regard to carrying out 
spot checks of detected substances. The legislative base must 
also be improved: As always, it has failed to keep pace with 
the demands of life and is inadequate to the evil wrought upon 
individuals and society by drug addiction.

<F P=106> [Article by Rick Catlin: "Drugs Arrests Boost Crime Figures"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The bad news is that overall crime incidents in 
the Cayman Islands rose by 240 more cases (up 7.8 percent) in 
1993 compared with 1992. The good news is that the increase "is 
accounted for by activity in drugs interdiction which resulted 
in a total of 894 offences being detected (in that category) 
compared with 606 in 1992," said RCIP Commissioner Alan 
Ratcliffe. 
  In reviewing the 1993 crime statistics at a press conference 
Thursday morning, the Commissioner conceded that the 3,298 
offences reported in 1993 "is a lot of crime." 
  At the same time, he was optimistic because the rise in 
crime 
was directly attributable to drug arrests and offences. He noted 
it was "gratifying" that more than 75 percent of crimes (2,532) 
were solved. "But there's still no room for complacency," he 
added. The 77 percent clearup rate is a 10-percent increase from 
1992, he pointed out. Police clear a crime when a suspect is 
arrested and charged, not when a conviction occurs. [passage 
omitted] 
  In discussing the drugs problem, the Commissioner made it 
clear that the police statistics "only show how successful we 
have been in tackling the drugs problem." The statistics do not 
show the overall usage or sale. 
  "There is evidence there are far more drugs on the island 
than have ever been here before," he said. 
  He and Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts are convinced 
Cayman has become a major transshipment point for drugs. "Drugs 
are shipped here to go north. Some do find the local market, but 
it's impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic 
market," said Commissioner Ratcliffe. 
  He based that upon a discovery rate estimated at 10 percent 
of the total and the fact that police seized 4,330 pounds of 
ganja (marijuana) and 52 pounds of cocaine in 1993. "If (those 
figures) are 10 percent then that becomes "worrying." And, he 
pointed out, that's just what police seized. It does not include 
Customs seizures in 1993. 
  Superintendent Cutts concurred, saying Cayman "is like a 
giant warehouse" for drugs coming from Jamaica headed for the 
United States. When asked what the police are doing to stop the 
flow of illegal drugs into Cayman, he deferred to Customs. 
"Customs is the primary agency ... to stop drugs entering." 
  He praised his Drugs Squad staff, noting that the 14 people 
on the Squad "work long hours," and often become stressed out in 
the battle against drugs. 
  Sometimes it might appear the Drugs Squad is fighting a 
"losing battle" said Mr. Cutts. "But you try and keep your 
finger in the dike." 
  "Make no mistake, I don't think we are fighting a losing 
battle. This is a beautiful island and it can be kept that way," 
if people work together to eliminate the drugs problem, he said. 
"Solve our problem here. Look at the people arrested and their 
nationality."

  [Text] The Cayman Islands Chamber of Commerce has embarked 
on an ambitious new programme to assist police in the war 
against drugs. 
  Citing drugs as the "single largest contributor to crime in 
the Cayman Islands," Chamber President Mr. Roy McTaggart 
announced Wednesday morning that the Chamber is going to assist 
the RCIP Drugs Squad in 1994 with a minimum of CI$15,000 in 
donations. 
  The funds will be for payments to persons providing 
information leading to the arrest of drug offenders and as 
additional monies (outside of government funds) for the Drugs 
Squad to purchase equipment that will assist them in combating 
drug traffic and traffickers. 
  Mr. McTaggart said the Chamber would be soliciting 
contributions from its members and the general public during 
1994. 
  To get the new programme started, Mr. McTaggart presented 
Drugs Squad Chief Superintendent Trevor Cutts with a cheque for 
CI$1,000 for additional equipment. 
  Mr. McTaggart also announced the Chamber will be encouraging 
members to "establish firm drug policies for the workplace," in 
1994. Results of similar programmes have shown anti-drug 
measures lower employee turnover, decrease absenteeism and 
result in fewer work-related accidents. 
  He called upon Chamber members and the public to support 
police and the war on drugs. 
  Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said he was not at 
liberty to discuss new types of equipment to be purchased 
because "I don't want to give comfort to drug dealers..." 
  The equipment to be purchased with the extra funds will 
"help 
me and my men do the job," said the Superintendent. 
  One piece of equipment not on the purchase list is an 
Ionscan 
machine. The machine is now in use by Customs and drugs squads 
at most major airports in North America as a means of detecting 
drugs, guns and dangerous chemicals in luggage or carried by 
passengers. Superintendent Cutts said while the machine is 
something he believes in, it's more suited to Customs operations 
than for drugs. 
  But one item on his `wish list' is more officers. While many 
believe drugs is the number one crime problem in Cayman, the 
Drugs Squad operates with just 14 full-time personnel -- 
including the two superintendents -- and two uniformed officers 
on loan. That's 16 people working an average of 19 hours a day 
with no overtime pay. And those hours create a lot of stress on 
the handful of dedicated officers on the Squad, he said. But 
working hard against drugs "is the right thing to do," he added. 
  The Superintendent has requested an additional 10 officers 
and he'll be happy with five. RCIP Commissioner Alan Ratcliffe, 
however, said there is "no chance in the immediate future," that 
more men will be assigned to the Squad. 
  The Commissioner did note that the soon-to-be formed Special 
Task Force (STF) will be available for drugs squad operations if 
needed. 
  Superintendent Cutts acknowledged the help of the Chamber is 
just a start. "I'm grateful to the Chamber but I need more help 
from people." 
  By people help, he means more information from persons in 
the 
districts. He needs confidential information and he deals in 
confidential sources and anonymity on a full-time basis. "If we 
get help from the public, we can make a dent this year" on drugs 
and drug use. 
  The number of drug dealers in Cayman is very small and 
"People know exactly who is dealing in drugs," he said. 
  Commissioner Ratcliffe praised these latest efforts by the 
Chamber of Commerce in the fight against crime and drugs, saying 
"we appreciate what the Chamber is doing."

  [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands (CANA) -- 
Four Jamaican nationals living in the Cayman Islands were 
charged Tuesday with a variety of drug offences after police 
seized more than 350 pounds of marijuana over the New Year's 
weekend. 
  The four are Robert Everton Neil and Robert Gammon, both of 
St. Elizabeth, Jamaica and Seaford John Singh and Stalinova 
Singh, husband and wife from Clarendon. 
  All four were charged with possession of a controlled drug 
with intent to supply along with simple possession. 
  Prosecuting Attorney (Crown Counsel) Adam Roberts said the 
foursome were part of a sophisticated operation, headed by Neil 
in the Cayman Islands, with an "origination" in Jamaica. 
  Magistrate Peter Jackson denied bail for the four, despite 
the pleas from Mrs. Singh that she had six children in Jamaica 
and needed to care for them. 
  Bail was denied on the grounds the defendents would likely 
leave the island as they have few local ties, Jackson said. 
  The 352 pounds of marijuana seized by Drugs Squad officers 
has an estimated street value of US$450,000, said Drugs Squad 
superintendent Trevor Cutts. 
  Cutts has not ruled out further arrests in the ongoing case 
and has said he is pursuing leads on how drugs are getting from 
Jamaica to Cayman.

  [Excerpt] Officers of the Royal Cayman Islands Police Drug 
Squad seized more than 350 pounds of ganja and arrested a total 
of seven people in two separate operations over the weekend. 
  Drug Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts called the seizures 
"an excellent start to the new year," and "bodes well for 
further 1994 operations." 
  The first operation was on Friday, 31 December. Mr. Cutts 
said the Drug Squad received a call from authorities at 
Northward Prison. Two prisoners had allegedly tried to get about 
a pound of ganja into the prison. 
  Drug Squad officers responded immediately. "We took our dogs 
and Customs assisted with their dogs. There was good liaison all 
around," he said. 
  Several small amounts of ganja were recovered from areas 
immediately surrounding the prison, but not from any secure 
area, Mr. Cutts pointed out. As a result of the recovery, two 
prisoners were arrested and are being dealt with by prison 
officials. 
  The second operation, over New Year's Eve and through the 
night, culminated around 4:00 p.m. on New Year's Day with the 
recovery of 272 pounds of ganja and the arrest of a male West 
Bay resident. 
  The ganja was seized in an area of East End, but Mr. Cutts 
declined to be more specific. He did note, however, that the 
person arrested was a resident of West Bay. 
  As a result of enquiries in connection with the New Year's 
Day arrest, on 2 January, the operation continued with the 
arrest of three other men and a female person. Two of the people 
were arrested in West Bay. An additional 80 pounds of ganja was 
confiscated, Superintendent Cutts said, bringing the total 
amount recovered in the operation to 352 pounds with a street 
value estimated at around CI$340,000. He anticipated that at 
least three of the people involved would likely appear in court 
today (Tuesday, 4 January). 
  He characterized those involved as part of a group involved 
in drugs sales in Cayman. 
  The investigation is continuing and the Superintendent did 
not rule out additional arrests or the confiscation of drugs 
and/or assets. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Investigative Police have arrested the most 
wanted drug trafficker in the country. Selin Valenzuela 
Galdamez, 49, has been at large since 1992, when he was indicted 
by the Swedish courts on charges of having financed many drug 
shipments, including 40 kg of cocaine hidden in packages of 
dried grapes. 
  Two other Chileans were sentenced in Sweden for the same 
crime. The Chilean police reported that Valenzuela has been 
involved in drug trafficking since the 1970's, but that his 
arrest had not been possible because he was using a false name. 
  An Investigative Police officer said that Valenzuela is 
undoubtedly the most wanted drug trafficker in the country 
because of his link with international rings. 
  Valenzuela was arrested in the city of Villa Alemana on 
charges of fraud against many companies for over 70 million 
pesos, and not because of drug trafficking. [passage omitted] 
  The police also arrested two of Valenzuela's partners, 
identified as Ruben Calderon and Raul Oyarsun. The police 
reported that they were using their money to build a luxury inn 
in the Fifth Region.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newscast," report by Alvaro Ayala] </F>
  [Text] Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff got 
tired of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's accusations and 
today told her that Colombia does not accept foreign pressure 
when making legal decisions because it is a sovereign state. 
Alvaro Ayala reports. 
  [Ayala] U.S. Attorney General Reno told de Greiff: I am 
increasingly concerned by the fact that in your correspondence 
you do not include information on the process of conversations 
with the chieftains of the Cali Cartel and because you have not 
mentioned that the Prosecutor General's Office plans to 
prosecute and put those chieftains on trial. These omissions 
are what create the environment of distrust you mention in your 
letters. 
  Today the prosecutor general reacted and reminded his U.S. 
counterpart, Janet Reno, that in Colombia the judicial system 
functions independently, without bending to foreign pressure. 
  [Begin recording] 
  de Greiff: Colombia's Judicial Branch cannot be 
subjected to the evaluations Ms. Reno may want to pass on the 
evidence they supply. Cooperation is fine, but impositions are 
not. [end recording] 
  The prosecutor general said that on 20 June he will be 65 
and 
that his remaining in his post depends on the Supreme Court of 
Justice. He said that personally he would like to complete the 
four-year period for which he was elected. 
  The Supreme Court of Justice, the High Council of the 
Judiciary, and a U.S. court adviser, have stated their support 
for de Greiff. 
  William Davis is an important U.S. court adviser. He is in 
Colombia participating in a seminar on court backlogs organized

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has not let 
recent statements by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno upset him. 
Today he indicated that the United States is too thin-skinned 
when it comes to legalizing drugs. The prosecutor general said 
that U.S. diplomatic officials visited his office and that he 
had answered U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. [Begin recording] 
  De Greiff: No, no, it was not a matter of them

  Unidentified reporter: Mr. Prosecutor, one last 
question. It would seem that your WASHINGTON POST article has 
caused quite a frenzy in the United States. 
  De Greiff: That is correct. I am very sorry that 
this has been the case. It would seem that the Americans are 
very thin-skinned. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Confidential" report by Darcy Queen; from the "24 Hours </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has left 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff alone in the fight 
concerning the policy over the Cali Cartel members' surrender to 
justice authorities. During an informal meeting with foreign 
journalists he said the Colombian Government does not welcome 
the fight between the prosecutor general and U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno. 
  Attorney General Arrieta rejected what the prosecutor 
general 
said in what represents a struggle for power that goes beyond 
Colombia's borders. In the meeting Arrieta said that the 
Colombian Government does not agree with the prosecutor 
general's position or academic views concerning his U.S. 
counterpart, Janet Reno. 
  Nevertheless, he said Reno's noncompromising attitude 
encourages solidarity with the prosecutor general, which was not 
advisable for the Colombian Government because it is concerned 
that this fight obstructs the surrender process. 
  Immediately after the meeting an Associated Press report 
said: Arrieta stated his concern that drug traffickers might 
fish in troubled waters if the confrontation continues.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The government has decided to make public its 
position on the appearance of Valle drug kingpins before justice 
authorities. By failing to confess their crimes, the kingpins 
are hoping that the government will open investigations against 
them, whereupon the lack of evidence will virtually preclude any 
further action against them. 
  According to Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, the 
government 
has expressed its concern and alerted Prosecutor General Gustavo 
de Greiff so that "the nation can head off the legal maneuvering 
of criminals who are trying to evade responsibility" and set up 
"an eventual impunity" for themselves. 
  The minister, in a seven-page letter, said that in a shrewd 
interpretation of the regulations on surrendering to the 
authorities, the drug traffickers' attorneys think their clients 
can go to justice officials without confessing to any crimes or 
cooperating in any meaningful way, so that cases will be opened 
and then they will be let go for lack of evidence. 
  "These individuals, assuming that no formal evidence will be 
provided in an investigation against them, are counting on a 
preliminary inquiry or formal prosecution to begin under the 
aforementioned regulations and then to result in no 
determination of criminal liability because of their failure to 
cooperate. 
  "In the first case, if a preliminary investigation takes 
place, they are hoping that after the four-month term is up, as 
provided in the code, the Prosecutor General's Office would be 
forced to issue an order of dismissal, which would not make the 
case res judicata, but would be a convenient 
mechanism for making it appear that the individual is not a 
suspect in any crime. 
  "In the second case, that is, if they try to get a criminal 
investigation opened, their objective is none other than to have 
an inquiry begin that would then find no evidence against them, 
whereupon they could request (...) that the Prosecutor General's 
Office issue a ruling in the preliminary hearing that would 
preclude a probable cause proceeding. That order would indeed 
make the case res judicata, which could eventually 
lead to impunity for them." 
  With reference to the letter, De Greiff told EL TIEMPO 
yesterday that "the Prosecutor General's Office, as a division 
of the judicial branch, will not issue general directives; it 
will issue only the writs and other orders that are within its 
purview, in each particular case. Therefore, it will take no 
position on the minister's letter." 
  The minister's letter comes in the wake of the appearance of 
three alleged drug kingpins of the Valle region, Elmer Herrera 
Buitrago ("Pacho Herrera"), Luis Carlos Ramirez Abadia, and Jose 
Olmedo Ocampo, at the Prosecutor General's Office between 11 and 
14 January of this year. 
  Herrera, Ramirez, and Ocampo and their attorneys stated that 
they were appearing before justice officials pursuant to Article 
369E of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that 
anyone who has good cause to believe he is being sought by the 
authorities may appear before justice officials to clarify his 
legal status. 
  After the appearances, the Prosecutor General's Office 
ordered the corresponding preliminary inquiries to begin, 
because, as De Greiff explained, no charges had been filed or 
evidence gathered that would make it possible to arrest them. 
  The appearance of the three alleged drug traffickers 
precipitated meetings this week between De Greiff and Attorney 
General of the Nation Carlos Gustavo Arrieta and President Cesar 
Gaviria. The latter expressed concern that he had not been 
informed of the matter and called for closer cooperation. 
  The government believes that Article 369E applies to cases 
of 
individuals who "are known to be or firmly believe themselves to 
be sought or pursued by the authorities." 
  In other words, people who are currently being investigated 
or who, knowing that no such investigation is taking place, turn 
themselves in precisely to confess their crimes. 
  According to Gonzalez's letter, in the government's view, 
"if 
a person merely appears before the authorities without providing 
any evidence of a punishable act or possible criminal liability, 
there are no grounds to open an investigation, because that 
would mean putting the responsibility for initiating criminal 
action in the hands of potential defendants," with the risk of 
the maneuvers mentioned above. 
  Launching investigations prematurely without solid evidence 
or without a confession or acknowledgement of guilt by the 
individual could result in impunity, according to the government. 
<H5>  Confession </H5>
  The executive branch's position on this matter is that, when 
individuals who are not the subject of criminal investigations 
come forward, Article 369B of the new code applies, "which is 
why the article is entitled `Benefits for Persons Not Being 
Prosecuted.'" 
  Specifically, the article states: "If the person giving 
testimony freely and spontaneously confesses his participation 
in punishable acts, pursuant to Article 33 of the Political 
Constitution, and cooperates to ensure that justice is done, an 
investigation shall be opened in his case." 
  This is the scope of the new regulations for the surrender 
policy, says the minister. In essence, these regulations require 
effective cooperation with law enforcement so that a preliminary 
investigation or formal probable cause proceeding may take 
place, resulting in sufficient evidence to prosecute the person 
appearing to provide such evidence. 
  "We cannot forget the basic objective of the justice system, 
which is to bring criminals to justice, either by pursuing them 
until they are arrested and convicted, or by applying the 
surrender policy on the basis of cooperation for effective 
administration of justice." 
  Finally, in his letter to De Greiff, the minister urges that 
a consensus be reached so that "we can continue the surrender 
program on the proper terms" and so that the government can 
decide what guarantees it will offer, including incarceration 
facilities and other security measures. 
  "Because this issue is so important for the country, the 
government believes it is essential to maintain close and 
constant cooperation and coordination with the Prosecutor 
General's Office and the Attorney General's Office in this 
regard. In that way, the concerns that have been expressed can 
be taken into consideration and a consensus can be reached on 
such vital issues, and this will benefit the surrender policy," 
emphasizes the letter. 
<H5>  [Box, p 22A] </H5>
<H5>  Highlights of the Letter </H5>

  -  The mere fact that a person appears before the appropriate 
authority on the pretext that he is being sought by law 
enforcement is not, in our opinion, legal grounds for issuing an 
order to open a preliminary investigation or probable cause 
proceeding; if that were to occur, the decision to pursue 
criminal action would be placed exclusively in the hands of 
those who are deceitfully trying to get a criminal prosecution 
going against themselves (...). 
  Anyone who appears without intending to cooperate is only 
trying to inveigle the authorities into issuing a decision that 
will serve as an obstacle later on, to prevent unfavorable 
rulings when the state manages to obtain sufficient evidence of 
his guilt. 

  -  A person appearing for the sole purpose of having an 
investigation opened so that the state will try to prove that he 
committed a punishable act runs counter to the purpose of the 
regulation, which is to ensure the effectiveness of justice; 
unless the person simply confesses his crime, in which case 
Article 369B of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be 
applied. 
  -  The application of Article 369E of the procedural 
statute is predicated upon cooperation with justice authorities. 
Indeed, the aforementioned regulation is part of the legal 
institution known as "surrender to and cooperation with justice 
authorities," which is aimed at imposing the proper penalties on 
those who have violated other people's rights but who have 
agreed to abide by the social and legal order. That is also the 
reason why the appearance is made exclusively before the 
prosecutor general of the nation or his deputy. 
  -  The provisions 
that set forth rewards for cooperating with justice authorities 
distinguish between two situations: that of persons who are 
being prosecuted and that of persons who are not. 
  As for the first case, it necessarily implies that the 
authorities have evidence of the person's guilt, so coming 
forward and cooperating effectively are among the many criteria 
taken into consideration in the discretionary decision to grant 
the benefits provided by law (literal E), Article 369A. 
  Now, if the person is not being criminally prosecuted, 
Article 369B of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be 
applied. It was specifically designed to address such cases, 
which is why it is entitled "Benefits for Persons not Being 
Prosecuted." Its second paragraph states: "If the person giving 
testimony freely and spontaneously confesses his participation 
in punishable acts, pursuant to Article 33 of the Political 
Constitution, and cooperates to ensure that justice is done, an 
investigation shall be opened in his case...." It should be 
noted that in this case, appearing before the authorities is not 
one of the criteria for deciding whether to grant benefits, and, 
therefore, it was expressly excluded as a reason for granting 
benefits during the debate and passage of the law in the 
Congress of the Republic. 

  -  From the above, it is concluded that as we interpret 
Article 369E of the procedural statute, the following 
prerequisites would have to be met for its application: 
  a. That there be effective cooperation in the administration 
of justice, in accordance with the criteria that govern such 
matters. 
  b. That there be a preliminary investigation or formal 
probable cause proceeding. 
  c. That such proceedings result in sufficient evidence to 
prosecute anyone who is thought to be involved in criminal 
activity or who has come forward to provide such evidence.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has ruled out a massive 
surrender by the Cali Cartel chiefs after one of the Mafia 
chiefs surrendered to justice last Saturday. The official 
considers the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales who 
last Saturday turned himself in to one of the representatives of 
the Office of the Prosecutor General in Palmira, some 400 km 
southwest of Bogota, to be "an isolated case." Arrieta 
reiterated: "I do not think that the most powerful members of 
the Cali Cartel are about to surrender to justice." 
  Late in 1993 the lawyers of the powerful Cali Cartel began 
to 
contact Colombian justice officials to negotiate the cartel 
members' surrender in exchange for legal benefits such as a 
reduction in sentences and house arrests, but the government 
rejected this. Arrieta said that the remodeling work being done 
in the Palmira jail is almost finished, and this is where the 
leaders of the organization responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine shipments to the United States will be sent. He 
mentioned that Urdinola "is not an important man" within the 
cartel and that the authorities were fully aware of his 
"desperate plans" to surrender to justice. 
  According to the Colombian media quoting reports from state 
security organizations, the surrender of important Cali Cartel 
members -- including leader Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela -- is 
imminent.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Prior to 1988, the man who today has "cocaine 
falling like rain" on northern Valle del Cauca was simply an 
active police officer with no rank. 
  [Victor Julio Fomeque] Patino, who was subsequently assigned 
to the Secret Police Division in Buenaventura from the F-2's 
[Judicial Police and Criminal Statistics Office] official 
garrison, began to promote a private justice squad. With the 
help of a police officer named Benavides, his brothers, and 
other police officers, Patino -- against whom an arrest warrant 
has been issued by faceless prosecutors from Cali -- became a 
member of the group that operated in Buenaventura under the name 
"Thief Killers" [Los Mata Ladrones]. 
  Although his leadership in the "Thief Killers" gave him some 
clout, a different episode began his drug trafficking career. 
  Promoted to personal bodyguard of Captain Beltran in the 
Police Intelligence Service, Patino finally had the opportunity 
to truly demonstrate his power and courage. 
  Patino saved the life of Capt. Beltran by helping him to 
escape unharmed from an attack. The compensation was not long 
in coming. Capt. Beltran, connected to an important Cali drug 
trafficker, offered Patino the opportunity to send small amounts 
of cocaine "pinned" [apuntados] to shipments in which the 
captain participated. 
  This situation continued for some time until Beltran decided 
Patino was ready to meet their mutual benefactor, a drug 
trafficker whom the DEA has been trailing for years and who has 
always been one of the top five men in the Valle del Cauca drug 
trafficking organization. 
  The contact allowed Patino to advance from meager amounts of 
cocaine to up to 2 to 3 kg on the northern Valle del Cauca 
traffickers' route to Miami (Florida). 
  Patino's prosperous career, however, served to separate him 
from his former allies the "Thief Killers." 
  The new business among Patino, the police official, and the 
drug traffickers ended with Benavides' transfer to Bogota and 
his subsequent death a few months later. 
  A few weeks later, Patino resigned from the force and began 
to advance in the organization until he became an associate of 
two other powerful drug traffickers. The three began to ship 
cocaine on their own account. 
  Their ambition, however, exasperated the Cali Cartel's top 
brass, which held a meeting and decided to geographically divide 
northern Valle del Cauca Department among themselves and to 
assign routes, markets, and responsibilities. 
  One group was given the center of the department, and the 
other was assigned northern Valle del Cauca, Tulua, Salonica, 
Canon de Las Garrapatas (limits between Valle del Cauca and 
Choco Departments) and southern Risaralda Department. Still 
others assumed direct control over finances and the main 
contacts abroad. 
  Patino apparently was under the direct command of two chiefs 
of the northern Valle del Cauca cartels. He could no longer 
ship cocaine on his own behalf, but he was given control over 
and participation in all reception and shipment operations. 
This included several shipments of heroin made last year from 
the Buenaventura and Choco coasts. 
  There in the bowels of the cartel, Patino assumed the alias 
"El Quimico" or "El Papi," and in a short time he substantially 
reduced the cartels' dependency on Bolivian and Peruvian cocaine 
paste. 
  In turn, he promoted the expansion of plantations in various 
parts of Colombia and established an important coca paste 
processing laboratory in Tapon del Darien [Panama]. The 
laboratory was only a 25-minute flight from the border with 
Panama and an exactly one hour flight from Cali. 
  Two additional processing centers with the capacity to 
refine 
500 kg of cocaine were installed near the border between Valle 
del Cauca and Choco on the banks of a stream that flows into the 
Cauca River in Saija district. 
  The possibility of turning Choco into a center for drug 
trafficking prompted Patino to illegally hire a Peruvian 
engineer to draw topographic maps of the area. At the end of 
last year, Patino was waiting for a man known in Cali as "Zapato 
Blanco" to provide him with false but quite realistic 
identification documents to conceal the Peruvian's nationality 
and thereby allow the man to be linked to a front company. 
  At the same time, Patino was putting the finishing touches 
on 
the process to introduce psychotropic and chemical substances 
through Buenaventura, Barranquilla, and the Ecuadoran border. 
  Patino's current prominence in the business is only partly 
due to his ability to supervise the shipping and receiving of 
cocaine. Patino also coordinates an impressive organization that 
includes a 34-ship fleet, a complex network of informers, hired 
killers, money launderers, cocaine trafficking contacts abroad, 
and several hundred business fronts. 
  The maritime flotilla comprises four boats; six pleasure 
yachts with diesel motors; two cargo vessels for transporting 
supplies and merchandise; and seven fishing boats with a 7-meter 
draft, 11-knot speed, VHF and UHF communications systems, and 
72-mile radars. There are also shrimp boats and tuna fishing 
boats up to 1,200 tons each. 
  Although most of the yachts, boats, and small draft vessels 
currently appear in the name of individuals or of a Colombian 
consortium, the Valle del Cauca traffickers have been able to 
hide larger draft ships registered under Honduran, Mexican, and 
Ecuadoran flags. There is even one registered under a South 
Korean flag. 
  Patino is also an organizer of sophisticated and complex 
cocaine and weapons caches. Between August and September 1992, 
Patino arranged for the construction of a multilevel building in 
Valle with caches between the floors. Television cameras and 
sophisticated Super Bland alarm systems were hidden between the 
first and second floors, and false access doors constructed of 
steel and concrete reinforcements and operated by remote control 
were installed in the building. 
  The Prosecutor's Office, the police, and the Armed Forces 
intelligence services had access to information on Patino and 
other drug traffickers' activities. 
  The Prosecutors' Office had access to two witnesses, and the 
Armed Forces, within the framework of a weapons-trafficking 
investigation, had access to informers' statements. 
  Nevertheless, it was not until August 1993 that the 
Prosecutor's Office and the intelligence services turned their 
attention to the man whom they point out as the chief of the 
drug business in the northern part of Valle del Cauca. 
  A hired killer shot four times Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez, 
Armed Forces intelligence, from behind on 6 August 1993. 
Alvarez had been assigned to the Armed Forces intelligence 
network in Buenaventura; he was subsequently transferred to the 
petroleum port of Barrancabermeja and finally to Cartagena. 
  Although Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez had obtained in 
Buenaventura valuable information on the structure of the 
organizations in northern Valle del Cauca, it was in Cartagena 
where he saw the opportunity to bring these before the law. 
  A former motorcyclist, Victor Patino came to Alvarez' office 
in Cartagena one morning at the end of June and confirmed part 
of the information he had. 
  Realizing the information he had lacked value, Alvarez 
contacted the intelligence network in the Pacific. The idea was 
to coordinate presentation of the witness before the District 
Attorney's Office; this was done. 
  Nevertheless, the Armed Forces and the District Attorney's 
Office, believing they had a witness who had charges against 
Patino, received a bitter surprise. After making his 
deposition, the witness vanished. 
  The Armed Forces' investigation initiated in the first week 
of July led to another witness who disclosed how the missing 
witness was now back in the organization, reprimanded by Patino. 
  Subsequently, Alvarez was murdered on 6 August. At this time 
the authorities decided to establish one by one Patino's 
connections and those of his organization. 
  Thus, the state's intelligence services had identified in 
December 1993 five cocaine production and processing leaders; 
eight coordinators in the shipping of drugs via wood, frozen 
chicken, fuel tanks, fruits, fish, and other exports; and seven 
organization contacts in Caracas, Panama City, and New York, as 
well as 22 members of the organization's network of security and 
hired killers. 
  The Armed Forces' informers have attributed to this last 
group -- which is comprised of former military institutions' 
noncommissioned officers and retired officials, police agents, 
former M-19 [19 April Movement] guerrillas, and even a former 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorist -- the murder of 
two of the organizations' links named Duran and Alzate. 
  Duran and Alzate, who were charged with transporting a 
cocaine shipment to a landing strip near Tulua, had decided to 
sell the drugs and say the police had seized the merchandise. 
  Two hired killers named Riascos and Jairo tended this 
account. The bodies of Alzate and Duran -- with a shot in the 
nape and their stomachs slit and weighted with stones to prevent 
the bodies from floating -- were thrown in the Cauca River, on 
the right bank at the entrance of Yotoco. 
  The drug purchaser, a trafficker named Perez who had been an 
Ochoas agent, was also sentenced to death; nevertheless, given 
his past, his death was less harsh. 
  "Arandela" [not further identified] and a man named Ordonez 
surprised Perez at an establishment en route to the sea. They 
started an argument and then killed him. 
  According to judicial sources the identification of the 
organization administered by Patino is only the tip of the 
iceberg of the drug traffickers' business in Valle del Cauca. 
<H5>  Who's Who in the Liaison Network? </H5>
  Patino's network consists of retired policemen, gunmen, and 
former M-19 guerrillas who were contacted by "El Quimico" after 
that guerrilla group's demobilization. 
  "NN Duran:" Peruvian, former member of the Tupamaros [Tupac

<H5>  Navy: "This Is A Setup" </H5>
  Navy Lieutenant Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez, accused, along 
with 
three other officers, of organizing a network to murder 100 
people including leftist and civilian leaders in 
Barrancabermeja, testified at the 109th Criminal Military Court 
last Wednesday. 
  The officer had requested days before that he be allowed to 
testify so as to clarify the reported incident. 
  As did Quinonez, Majors Jairo Osorio and Rafael Colon and 
Lieutenant Mauricio Varon had already testified. In addition, 
the offers have testified before investigators of the Prosecutor 
General's Office and the Attorney General's Office. 
  Even though the defense's arguments have been kept secret so 
far, EL TIEMPO has consulted with different judicial sources and 
has learned the officers have answered each of the accusations 
against them. They said this is a setup prepared by an 
organization of Valle del Cauca drug traffickers. 
  Former Navy Noncommissioned Officers Carlos Lopez Maquilon 
and Saulo Segura Palacios, for whom two arrest warrants have 
been issued, filed criminal charges against the colonel, the two 
majors, and the lieutenant at the end of last year. 
  The former noncommissioned officers said they had evidence 
Quinonez and the other officers directed a network of hired 
assassins that murdered at least 100 people in Barrancabermeja. 
  To confirm their reports, the former noncommissioned 
officers 
presented recordings of coded conversations between Navy 
intelligence officers. 
  EL TIEMPO has learned the officers told the Prosecutor 
General's Office, military criminal justice, and the Attorney 
General's Office that only drug-trafficking groups were capable 
of intercepting communications between high-ranking Navy 
officers and manipulating the tapes. 
  The contents of the recordings, the officers stated, did not 
mention illegal activities, rather, investigation activities 
conducted in the Pacific area. 
  In their statements and interrogations before regular and 
criminal military justice, the officers said the Navy launched 
intelligence plans in 1991 to control the entry of weapons 
through the Pacific and managed to discover several networks of 
drug traffickers. 
<H5>  The Investigation </H5>
  Members of the Pacific intelligence network led by Captain 
Juan Carlos Alvarez have discovered these weapons traffickers 
supply the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and ELN 
[Army of National Liberation] guerrilla groups, as well as 
drug-trafficking organizations. 
  Transferred from the Pacific to the Cartagena intelligence 
network, Alvarez contacted a man who claimed to have information 
on the Norte del Valle Cartel. 
  In exchange for a reward, this informer went to the Valle 
Regional Prosecutor's Office and spent four hours testifying 
against the leader of the drug-trafficking ring in Valle. The 
next day, when he should have continued his testimony, however, 
the witness disappeared. The witness had testified against 
Victor Julio Patino Fomeque. Members of the intelligence 
networks and the Regional Prosecutor's Office began the 
unsuccessful search for the witness. 
  Meanwhile in Cartagena, two hired assassins killed Captain 
Alvarez on 6 August -- the day of his birthday. It was then an 
order for a complete inquiry came from the Intelligence 
Directorate in Bogota to help the Prosecutor's Office find 
Alvarez' killers. 
  The authorities' inquiries led ultimately to another Navy 
informer who affirmed he saw the missing witness inside a car 
that belonged to Victor Patino and that Patino was accompanying 
him. This second informer added he had proof this man had 
returned to the cartel. 
  Meanwhile, a Prosecutor's Office secret witness came to 
Barranquilla and identified the alleged hired assassin who had 
apparently been paid by the drug traffickers. The Regional 
Prosecutor's Office issued a warrant a few weeks later for 
Patino's arrest based on statements by one of his bodyguards. 
  EL TIEMPO has established several witnesses have stated at 
the Prosecutor's Office Lopez Maquilon and Segura Palacios (the 
plaintiffs) were offered money to testify against the Navy's 
intelligence officers and participate in illicit actions. 
  "NCO Carlos Lopez Maquilon," one of the witnesses, "on 
several occasions prodded me to engage in dirty deals (...) for 
money so we could get rich." Another witness, in turn, said "in 
mid-February 1993, Carlos Lopez came to Magangue as the person 
in charge of the network and asked me to leave this work, 
because he had some mafioso keeping an eye on me." 
  The same witness testified Lopez "asked me to go to the 
Prosecutor's Office to accuse the intelligence director (...) 
that he would take care of counseling me, and that I would make 
good money with the Prosecutor's Office. Finally, he told met 
if I did not accept it would be better if I left the 
institution, because he would kill me along with his people." 
  The two witnesses told the investigators the drug 
traffickers 
had deceived the NCOs, telling them if they declared themselves 
guilty the Prosecutor's Office would pardon them and give them a 
huge reward. According to witnesses, the people who hired the 
NCOs also told them that, given they had left the institution 
(Lopez asked to be discharged when he filed the complaint), the 
Prosecutor's Office could not investigate them, because they 
were not servicemen but civilians, and the Attorney General's 
Office has no jurisdiction over them.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- In the first week of August 
1993, the prosecutor general met in his office with the members 
of the law firm Ristaud &amp; Abbel, who claimed to represent an 
organization of some 60 drug traffickers from the Valle del 
Cauca. Gustavo de Greiff told EL ESPECTADOR yesterday that "they 
came to be instructed on the rules for drug-trafficker 
surrenders, and I explained to them the entire legal framework 
of the policy on surrendering to justice authorities." One of 
them, Abbel, had been a high-ranking official of the U.S. 
Justice Department, in the very section that handles 
applications for extradition from Latin American countries. 
  Romulo Gomez, a Cali attorney, and Juan Fernandez 
Carrasquilla, a former magistrate from Bogota, visited the 
prosecutor general later on to give him the details of a formal 
proposal for the drug traffickers of the Valle del Cauca to turn 
themselves in. They made it clear that formally, they were only 
representing Gilberto Rodriguez O. and Julio Fabio Urdinola G., 
but that soon news would be received regarding other 
"colleagues." 
  "They mentioned that the Rodriguez Orejuela's had been 
cooperating with the authorities in the war against the Medellin 
Cartel, and that they had supplied data and information that 
helped the authorities in their fight against Pablo Escobar 
Gaviria. They wanted that to be taken into consideration," said 
the prosecutor general yesterday. 
  But when these contacts were made public, the inmates in the 
Itagui Prison, led by Roberto Escobar Gaviria, also sent the 
Prosecutor General's Office a letter naming the alleged members 
of the Pepes (Persecuted by Pablo Escobar) Group and demanding a 
judicial investigation of them. The prosecutor general responded 
that an offender's cooperation could only be taken into 
consideration after he turned himself in, not before, and the 
attorneys did not call back. 
<H5>  Neither Pepes Nor Jail </H5>
  But in late 1993, after Pablo Escobar's demise, there was 
talk in Cali of a plan for the "staggered surrender" of 200 
major drug traffickers, in which each would benefit by providing 
information on the next person to turn himself in. 
  At present, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez has 
acknowledged 
to EL ESPECTADOR in an interview, there is only one indictment 
against Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela from a U.S. court and none 
arising out of Colombian investigations, so the most important 
thing is for him to confess when he surrenders so that the 
American case will not be pursued. 
  Although Rodriguez Orejuela's and Julio Fabio Urdinola's 
attorneys insist that their "cooperation" in the search for 
Escobar should be recognized, they deny any ties with the Pepes 
and their organization to commit crimes through a cartel. 
  "With regard to that alleged organization (Pepes)," said De 
Greiff, "the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney 
General's Office have pursued many investigations, but there 
have been no witnesses or documentary evidence to allow us to 
identify its members individually." 
  While the letter bomb that practically blew up in Roberto 
Escobar's face confirmed the Pepes' threats, a letter in which 
Carlos Mario Alzate ("El Arete" [earring]) asked the director of 
prisons not to take him out of his maximum-security cell at La 
Picota even for judicial proceedings revealed the panic that 
this group's actions have instilled in members of Escobar's 
organization. 
<H5>  New Contacts </H5>
  In open letters sent by Roberto Escobar from his cell to the 
Prosecutor General's Office, two of the people accused of 
belonging to the Pepes, plus one other person, met with Gustavo 
de Greiff in his office on 14 January. He gave them 
documentation attesting that no summons had been issued in their 
names and that they were the subject of investigations to 
determine their involvement in certain interrogations, pursuant 
to Article 369E of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, through 
which they had managed to mislead the authorities in a drug 
enforcement operation in the Valle del Cauca and evade capture. 
  Although various witnesses interviewed this week by EL 
ESPECTADOR confirmed that the head of the Drug Trafficking Unit 
of the Prosecutor General's Office, Cruz Helena Aguilar 
Echeverri, last Monday mediated a "peace pact" between two men 
close to the late chief of the Medellin Cartel and Luis 
Guillermo Angel, an alleged middleman for the "Cali people," De 
Greiff emphatically declared that "the Prosecutor General's 
Office did not, does not, and will not have any involvement, 
either institutional or private, in any agreement between 
criminal organizations." 
  "What happened there," explained the prosecutor general, 
"was 
the continuation of some witness examinations and a report by a 
witness on cases he was familiar with for the purpose of 
comparing his statements with those of the defendants." 
<H5>  What Happens Next </H5>
  The house arrest requested by the drug traffickers was also 
ruled out in the discussions. "What must be verified now is how 
much they are willing to cooperate and what mechanisms can be 
implemented to make sure they do not continue to commit crimes 
through third parties," stated the prosecutor general, "but the 
government must also make sure that the work being done on the 
Cali and Palmira prisons will guarantee that they cannot escape." 
  History will be the judge as to whether this "surrender" 
will 
result in impunity. 
<H5>  [Box, p 13A] </H5>
<H5>  Government Explains Surrender </H5>
  The national government broke its silence on the various 
interpretations of the application of Article 369E of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure (CPP), which establishes measures to allow 
persons implicated in crimes to cooperate fully with the 
authorities. It stated its legal position on the matter in a 
letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez Diaz explained the purpose 
of the regulations and warned that some trial attorneys are 
trying to manipulate the system to obtain decisions that will 
make it easier for their clients to escape prosecution. 
  The minister took this stand after the alleged members of 
the 
Cali Cartel, Helmer Herrera Buitrago, Jose Olmedo Ocampo, and 
Juan Carlos Ramirez, appeared before the Prosecutor General's 
Office to request that an investigation be opened pursuant to 
the aforementioned CPP article. 
  Gonzalez Diaz stated that the mere fact that a person 
appears 
before the appropriate authority on the pretext that he is being 
sought by law enforcement is not legal grounds to issue an order 
to open a preliminary investigation or hold a probable cause 
hearing, and went on to say that this would put the 
responsibility for initiating criminal action exclusively in the 
hands of those who are trying to inveigle the authorities into 
filing criminal charges against them.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 MAR (EFE) -- The Emisoras 
Caracol Network has reported that "within the next few hours" 
four lieutenants of the late Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar 
will be transferred to Itagui Maximum Security Prison in the 
northwestern part of the nation. 
  A Caracol correspondent has reported that inmates Gustavo 
Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla (alias Maxwell and La Trapeadora), Luis 
Carlos Aguilar Gallego (El Mugre), Jose Fernando Posadas Fierro, 
and Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo (Arete) are scheduled to be 
transferred to Itagui. On 8 December 1993, the four confessed 
drug-traffickers were unexpectedly transferred to Santa Fe de 
Bogota's La Picota Prison. 
  The Caracol Network reports the inmates are being 
transferred 
to Itagui "despite recommendations against such a move by the 
national government." Two weeks ago, a conflict arose between 
Colombia's justice minister and the nation's prosecutor general 
because the minister opposed the order to transfer the inmates 
to another prison, warning that the transfer could help the 
dismantled Medellin Cartel reunite despite Pablo Escobar's 
December 1993 death. 
  Meanwhile in Medellin, it has been reported that the widow 
of 
Pablo Escobar, Victoria Henao, today visited her brother-in-law 
Roberto, alias Osito, at Itagui Prison. Victoria Henao traveled 
with her son Juan Pablo from her home in the Colombian capital 
to Medellin, where she stayed only a few hours. In the 
afternoon she returned to the Colombian capital aboard a charter 
flight.

  [Text] The commander of the 3rd Brigade headquartered in 
[Cali], General Rafael Hernandez Lopez, said yesterday that over 
the past six months raids have been carried out in northern, 
central, and southern Valle del Cauca Department, zones where 
members of the so-called Cali Cartel operate. 
  "We have been carrying out four or five raids each day in 
all 
those sectors where we believe there are presumed drug 
traffickers or subversives. What is happening is that now we 
have intensified them because the intelligence has improved," he 
added. 
  According to the general, 11 raids were carried out in Cali 
yesterday, seven in Palmira, four in Buga, and some others in 
Popayan and adjoining areas. 
  He added that in the course of these raids they have seized 
property, and vehicles, and have entered ranches and houses, but 
so far no individuals have been arrested. 
  In Ciudad Jardin neighborhood, in southern Cali, in the past 
few days various raids have been carried out in which 
authorities found a building under construction which contained 
a jacuzzi, gymnasiums, a sauna, and other luxuries. 
  The identity of the owners and the origin of the money 
invested in that building are a mystery, and the authorities 
decided to open an investigation to determine the identity of 
the owners. 
  Other sources revealed that among the property seized are 
armor-plated vehicles, one of which belongs to Fernando Tello 
Dorronsoro, a Liberal member of the House of Representatives 
running for reelection in Valle. 
  Spokespersons for the Prosecutor General's Office said that 
the vehicle was seized during the raid of a residence presumed 
to belong to former beauty queen Martha Lucia Echeverri. 
  With regard to several media reports on Thursday night [24 
Feb] that one of the operations was on the verge of capturing an 
important Cali Cartel leader, General Hernandez said it was 
false. 
  In addition, he said that all of confiscated items as well 
as 
"important documents which were being analyzed" will be turned 
over to the Regional Prosecutor General's Office which is 
conducting the investigation. 
<H5>  A Strike in Bogota </H5>
  In other news, a band of criminals which supposedly tried to 
sell information processing equipment to the Cali Cartel was 
dismantled last Thursday in Bogota by the Judicial and 
Investigative Police whose units captured four of the members. 
  The operation took place at the intersection of calle 60 and 
highway 17, in the Chapiero district, and the following items 
were seized: 47 Minitelt data processing units (video, textual), 
four Hewlett Packard monitors; sixty cartridges of various 
calibers, and one piece of sound equipment. 
  According to preliminary investigations, the subjects had 
contacts with the above-mentioned drug trafficking group and 
their activities were discovered by an undercover agent and 
through laborious intelligence work. 
  The four arrested were Salomon Gonzalez Garcia, Eduardo 
Hurtado Galvis, Luis Daniel Parra Munoz, and Jose Maria Larrea 
Corredor.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Pilar Barrera: "Summit and Peace </F>
Pact Among the Mafia"] 
  [Text] On Friday, 11 February, traffickers and spokesmen 
from the most powerful Mafia in Antioquia, Valle, and the Coast 
held a summit meeting to sign the document for the new peace 
among the Mafia. 
  After seven years of a bloody war, with hundreds of dynamite 
attacks on Down With Drugs headquarters, selective massacres, 
and the creation of Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Pepes), the 
traffickers leading the Mafia vendettas decided to sit down at 
the same table. 
  In Valle, protected by clandestinity, those claiming to be 
authorized spokesmen for the most powerful organizations in the 
country gathered for the first time. 
  In other words, they were representatives claiming to be 
acting directly on behalf of the brothers Gilberto and Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela, Jose Santacruz Londono, William Ortiz 
("Miky"), and Salomon Camacho, for the Valle traffickers; Carlos 
Castano, brother of Fidel ("Rambo"), for a branch of the 
Medellin Cartel; and two lawyers and a pregnant woman, on behalf 
of the Escobars and Escobar's ex-terrorist chiefs confined in 
prison. 
  The terms of the agreement include several concrete, 
compulsory demands upon the Medellin Cartel strongholds. 
  Initially, Pablo Escobar's survivors must retract the 
accusations linking Fidel and Carlos Castano with the brutal 
attack on the Avianca airplane that occurred during December 
1989, with a toll of 111 fatalities. 
  At the same time, Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo ("Arete") and 
other Escobar ex-terrorist chiefs now in prison must secure 
Julio Mamey's appearance before the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  According to the statements made at the summit, Mamey fled 
to 
North America after the attack of 28 July 1989 that ended the 
life of Antioquia's governor, Antonio Roldan Betancur. 
  The Castanos and the top-ranking Valle traffickers believe 
Mamey to be the only one who could reveal to the Prosecutor 
General's Office the way in which the murder was planned, and 
the steps taken, at Pablo Escobar's order, to make the car bomb 
explosion that took Roldan's life appear as a murder committed 
by Jose Santacruz Londono. 
  "Arete" and other convicted members of the Medellin Cartel 
must require the liaisons who are at large to appear before the 
Prosecutor General's Office, to confess all their crimes, and to 
submit to the prison sentences imposed on them. 
  In particular, the Valle traffickers believe that their 
former archenemies must surrender Juan Rios, an Escobar 
ringleader known by the nickname "La Chepa" ["The Hump"]. 
  The Cali traffickers accuse "La Chepa" of being the 
contriver 
of the principal massacres in Valle. They include, among others, 
the one that occurred on 25 September 1990 on a farm in the 
municipality of Candelaria (Valle), in which 27 persons were 
killed and several of the Cali Cartel's "capi di capi" [top 
bosses] escaped fortuitously. 
<H5>  Other Demands </H5>
  The police have indications that Elmer Herrera ("Pacho 
Herrera") himself escaped from the gory incident by hiding in an 
official car. 
  Finally, the Valle "narcos" and their Antioquian allies from 
the Castanos' sector demand that Pablo Escobar's former aides 
revise the charges that they have made against them in the 
investigations being conducted by the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  Among other claims, the Medellin traffickers would have to 
retract the names that they have given to the Prosecutor 
General's Office of presumed members of the "Pepes," beginning 
with Castano. 
  A source explained to EL TIEMPO: "The fact is that whoever 
wins will impose the conditions." 
  An additional point is that the Escobar family, or those 
left 
with his fortune, must make reparation for the harm inflicted on 
the victims of the Mafia war. 
  An authorized source explained to EL TIEMPO: "These points 
are recorded in a document, initially signed by the participants 
in the Cali summit, that is circulating in the Itagui, La 
Picota, and La Modelo jails." 
  According to the same source, "Arete," Jhon Jairo Velasquez 
Vasquez, ("Popeye"), and Carlos Aguilar Gallego ("El Mugre") 
have already signed the document. 
  The negotiation process among the cartels began brewing two 
months ago, just 15 days after the Search Bloc located and 
confronted Pablo Escobar at a residence located west of 
Medellin, on 2 December. 
  As EL TIEMPO published in its 6 February edition, at Itagui, 
La Modelo, and La Picota there was a preliminary agreement among 
the Medellin Cartel convicts to start the search for a peace 
alliance with their Valle enemies and with the one said to be 
the head of "Persecuted by Pablo Escobar," Fidel Castano. 
  An incognito ex-prosecutor, Enrique Mancera, the attorney 
who 
attempted to take the Escobar family out of the country, was 
located to act as spokesman for the Medellin convicts. 
  Even Pablo Escobar's wife, Maria Victoria Henao, and their 
son, Juan Pablo, have been involved in the negotiations. 
  Days before the summit among the Mafia spokesmen, Maria 
Victoria and her son visited Escobar's former allies at La 
Picota, on behalf of the search for peace. 
  At the same time, various documents reveal the internal 
crisis among Escobar's former allies. 
<H5>  Peace </H5>
  During a conversation between two prominent Escobar 
ex-agents, regarding the need for sending spokesmen to negotiate 
peace with the Cali Cartel, the first of them warned the other: 
"I tell you one thing, cool guy, we'll have to kneel here (...), 
or they'll kill us all; and we must at least see to it that the 
families live...." 
  Last Wednesday, after the summit among the "capos'" 
spokesmen 
in Valle, and at the request for an expansion of the 
investigation, "Arete" and "El Mugre" met in one of the rooms at 
the Prosecutor General's Office with two lawyers for the Cali 
Cartel and its representatives. 
  High-ranking spokesmen for the Prosecutor General's Office 
explained that this was no meeting, but rather a hearing on 
expansion of the investigation. However, EL TIEMPO spoke with 
attendees at the meeting, who claimed that "Arete" and "El 
Mugre" had talked for at least three hours with the Valle 
traffickers' spokesmen, one of them a man identified as 
Guillermo Angel. 
  The sources said that an incognito female prosecutor with 
the 
surname Aguilar was an exceptional witness at those talks, 
adding: "The regional director of Prosecutors' Offices in 
Bogota, Jorge Enrique Bautista, was also present for a short 
time." 
  They noted: "Meanwhile, Ana Montes, national director of 
Prosecutors' Offices, was waiting for the results of the meeting 
in another room." 
  As was reported, both "Arete" and "El Mugre" expressed their 
intention of ceasing the quarrels. "We are tired of fighting," 
they told the Cali Cartel representatives. 
  During the meeting, which lasted seven hours, between 1000 
and 1700, Pablo Escobar's men declared that they want to change 
their lives, that they need to get ahead, and that they want to 
be allowed to live calmly. 
  Also proposed was the need for helping many young criminals 
to give up their weapons.

<F P=106> [Report from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to a report that "NTC News" has obtained, 
Roberto Escobar plans to reorganize the Medellin Cartel's 
terrorist network from the Itagui jail. After Pablo Escobar's 
death, a struggle took place within the Medellin Cartel for its 
control. As a result, Roberto Escobar was attacked. It is 
believed a group under the leadership of Fidel Castano, alias 
Rambo, was behind this attack. Gustavo Tapia, alias Techo; Luis 
Carlos Molina Jepes; Miguel Angel Builen; and (Mickey Ramirez) 
comprise the group. 
  The members of the splinter group hit by Pablo Escobar are 
demanding the return of their properties that was seized and $20 
million. To meet these demands, Pablo Escobar's widow Maria 
Victoria Henao; her brother Fernando Henao, alias Hierbas; and 
those incarcerated in the Bogota jails, Carlos Mario Urquijo, 
Fernando Pozada Fierro, Luis Carlos Aguilar, and Gustavo 
Gutierrez Arrula have reached an agreement, through attorneys, 
to return all the properties. This group, under the leadership 
of Rafael Galeano and Mireya Moncada, are supported by the Cali 
cartel and Fidel Castano. In addition, they demand all the 
properties of all the cartel members who are incarcerated be 
returned as compensation for the deaths of their relatives. This 
agreement has been accepted by some of the incarcerated 
individuals and by Pablo Escobar's widow. 
  Roberto Escobar, as successor to the Medellin Cartel chief, 
however, does not accept this agreement. Therefore, he wants the 
inmates to be transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota to Medellin to 
reorganize and reactive the militias and the gangs that have 
always operated with Medellin Cartel funds.

<F P=106> [Report from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It was believed that one of the first victims of the 
internal Medellin Cartel feud was Jose Antonio Ocampo, alias 
Peluza. According to several reports, Ocampo, who was one of 
Pablo Escobar's lieutenants, was murdered after falling from the 
drug lord's graces. The name of Jose Antonio Ocampo appears in 
classified official files as an active member of the financial 
branch of the battered Medellin Cartel. The Army's 4th Brigade 
arrested him in Uraba in 1989, but he was released because of 
insufficient evidence. The authorities know he contributed to 
maintaining the narco-terrorist war for years. He rebelled 
against his boss and Escobar sentenced him to death. Peluza 
managed to escape the internal purge launched against Moncada 
and Galiano at the Envigado Prison complex. 
  Authorities have a video tape that proves Peluza is alive 
and 
well. NTC News, exclusively, has managed to get a hold of the 
tape. Jose Antonio Ocampo is currently being held hostage. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording] I am very happy to be able to send 
this message. [end recording] 
  These pictures show Jose Antonio Ocampo, alias Peluza, where 
he is being held. He looks bad. Two men bearing submachine guns 
guard him. Peluza taped a dramatic call to his family to save 
his life. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording] I hope and I know that you are 
praying to [words indistinct], my and your queen, for me to 
leave here. A thousand kisses. I love you all very much. [end 
recording] 
  On the tape, Peluza asks his family to act wisely. He begs 
his friends for solidarity. He orders his family to sell his 
properties and horses to collect the $2 million ransom.

  [Text] A 30-year-old man was last night in Police custody 
following the discovery of more than 90 pounds of cocaine in two 
suitcases at the Timehri International Airport. 
  The cache was stashed in the two suitcases lined with 
bedspreads which appeared to have been saturated with a kind of 
acidic substance aimed at throwing drugs sniffer dogs deployed 
at the airport off the scent, sources said last night. 
  According to the sources, the two suitcases were checked in 
by a passenger on the BWIA noon flight out of Timehri. When 
airline officials checked the aircraft, the passenger was not on 
board and he was found in the airport Immigration area after a 
search, the sources told the CHRONICLE. 
  He was taken to the luggage after Customs officials were 
summoned and more than 90 pounds of cocaine were discovered in 
the two suitcases, the sources said. 
  The passenger held by Police has been named as Jerimiah Foy, 
who lived in the United States but is from the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, according to the sources. 
  He is to appear in Court today charged with cocaine 
trafficking, Police sources confirmed. 
  According to reports, Foy arrived here last October 20 and 
was married to a Guyanese woman several days later. 
  Honduran-born U.S. resident Gwendoline Martinez, 63, who was 
jailed last month for trying to smuggle cocaine through the 
airport, had arrived in the country on October 20, reports 
indicated. 
  The grey and balding woman was nabbed on November 19, at the 
airport, with six pounds of cocaine stashed in parcels in her 
girdle. 
  Martinez claimed she was trapped into taking the drugs to 
the 
airport and pleaded guilty. 
  She was jailed for five years.

  [Text] A delegation of Colombian drug eradication 
professionals is expected here shortly to initiate a work 
programme under the Guyana/Colombia anti-drug campaign. 
  This was disclosed yesterday by Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin de Rubio after she signed the Guyana/Colombia 
anti-drug joint agreement at the Foreign Ministry here. 
  The agreement, proposed during her November 1993 visit to 
Guyana, provides for cooperation, assistance and exchange of 
information between the law enforcement agencies and judicial 
systems of the two countries. 
  It also provides for the establishment of a Mixed Commission 
which will be responsible for the elaboration of programmes and 
plans to deal with the drug menace. Mixed Commission meetings 
are to be held alternately in the two countries annually. 
  January 15 was the deadline fixed by the two countries for 
the signing of the joint agreement. 
  Noting that drug use and trafficking are two of humanity's 
greatest problems, the visiting Foreign Minister said it is on 
this basis that the two states have agreed to combat the scourge. 
  She added that Colombia expects President Cheddi Jagan and 
Foreign Minister Mr Clement Rohee to visit soon and hopes a "lot 
can be achieved" from that encounter in the area of drug 
eradication. 
  And Foreign Minister Rohee said the signing of the agreement 
signals another milestone in the relations between the two 
countries. 
  "It heralds a new thrust in the fight against drugs and 
commitment to this international scourge," he said. 
  He has also pledged this country's support to collaborating 
"in all forms" to end the illicit trade and use of drugs. 
  Guyana has entered into similar agreements with Venezuela, 
Cuba and Brazil. 
  Minister Sanin de Rubio, who flew in yesterday morning to 
sign the agreement, also called on President Jagan and held 
talks with officials at the CARICOM Secretariat before leaving 
for Suriname in the afternoon.

  [Text] Kingston (NICA)--A man who pleaded guilty in the 
Half-Way-Tree Criminal Court to possession of more than 2,000 
pounds of ganja, was described by Resident Magistrate Mrs. 
Shirley Lewis as being motivated by greed and not by need. 
  She fined the man, Eric Moo Young, 30, nicknamed "Mr. Big," 
of 13 Merrivale Close, Kingston 8, the maximum of $115,000 and 
sentenced him to a year's imprisonment but suspended the 
sentence for 18 months. 
  The prosecution's case, as outlined by Mr. Martin Gayle, 
Crown Counsel, was that on Sunday, October 31, a raiding party 
from the Special Anti-Crime Task Force, led by Detective 
Inspector Granville Gause, went to 25 Bronx Avenue, Barbican, 
Kingston 8, where they saw Michelle Cassanova, 31, saleswoman, 
and found 19 large cartons with 2,068 lbs (938.25 kilos) of 
compressed ready-for-export ganja. 
  Cassanova was charged with possession of the ganja, dealing 
in ganja and taking steps preparatory to exporting the weed. 
Further investigations by Det. Insp. Gause led, the same day, to 
the arrest of Moo Young, who said the ganja was his and he had 
given it to Cassanova to store for him. He was charged jointly 
with her and they were ordered remanded in custody. Ten days 
later, they appeared before the St. Andrew Resident Magistrate's 
Court at Half-Way-Tree before Her Hon. Mrs. Lewis and Cassanova 
pleaded guilty to possession of the ganja. Mrs. Lewis fined her 
$15,000 or six months' imprisonment. The Magistrate said the 
ganja business was too prevalent, with the rich and poor alike 
being involved. 
  It was time for a Drug Court to be established, she said, to 
deal exclusively with offences of that nature. Also, the 
Magistrate said fines for drug offences were too minimal and 
anybody could pay them. 
  Moo Young pleaded guilty to all three charges and was 
remanded in custody on December 17, for sentencing on December 
22. Mr. Howard Hamilton, Q.C., who with Miss Norma Linton, 
attorney-at-law, represented Moo Young, urged the court to show 
mercy to him because he had not tried to absolve himself, but 
had admitted it was his ganja, had not wasted the court's time, 
and had faced harsh reality and pleaded guilty. Miss Linton said 
Moo Young had been man enough to own up and pointed out that it 
was his first offence. She asked the Magistrate not to 
incarcerate him. 
  The Resident Magistrate imposed on Moo Young, maximum 
sentences of a fine of $15,000 or six months for possession of 
the ganja, $50,000 or 12 months for dealing in ganja, and 
$50,000 or 12 months for taking steps preparatory to exporting 
the ganja. In addition, on the charge of taking steps 
preparatory to exporting the ganja, she sentenced Moo Young to 
12 months' imprisonment but suspended the sentence for 18 months 
and ordered that he undergo supervision by a probation officer.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After four months of 
investigation, local Narcotics Division agents arrested a 
Mandeville man on Friday on charges of possession of ganja, 
dealing in ganja and taking steps preparatory to exporting ganja. 
  He is Carlton "Carly" Dunkley, 37, businessman and former 
policeman of Westwood Apartments, Mandeville, Manchester, police 
sources say. 
  The offences were alleged to have been committed in 
September 
when two drums of what was manifested as limestone, were taken 
to the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston to be 
air-freighted to Miami, Florida. 
  However when the drums were opened they were found to 
contain 
600 lbs. of compressed ganja, wrapped in several packages. 
Friday morning, Narcotics Division agents raided Mr. Dunkley's 
apartment and arrested him on the three charges. He is being 
held in custody to be taken before the Kingston RM Court at 
Sutton Street tomorrow.

  [Text] A Jamaican woman who took ill shortly after 
alighting from a plane in Panama, is now a patient under police 
guard in the Santo Tomas Hospital, Avenida, Balboa, in that 
country. 
  The woman, said to be an Informal Commercial Importer (ICI), 
is suffering from the toxic effects of cocaine she was smuggling 
in her stomach. 
  Reports are that the Jamaican, Cynthia Yvonne Barrett, of a 
Central Village address, in St. Catherine left the Norman Manley 
International Airport for Panama two Saturdays ago. 
  THE GLEANER was told that on arrival at the airport in 
Panama, Barrett fainted. It is alleged that one of the packages 
of cocaine she was smuggling in her stomach had burst. 
  When contacted, Jamaica's Ambassador to Mexico, Miss Evadne 
Coye, who oversees Jamaica's interest in Panama, said that 
Barrett is alive, but she has been arrested for trafficking 
drugs and is now recuperating under police guard in hospital. 
  Miss Coye added that once released by the hospital, Barrett 
will go to jail to await trial, which could take place anytime, 
up to two years. She also stated that the prison term for drug 
trafficking in Panama is between two and 10 years. 
  Since July 1991 to date, some 48 Jamaicans -- 28 men and 20 
women -- have been serving prison terms in Panama. 
  Earlier reports had indicated that Panama, with the 
assistance of the United States of America, had improved its 
drug detection system. 
  Miss Coye was quoted as saying recently that at least one of 
the Jamaicans who is currently serving a ten-year term, had 
suffered a mental break-down. This was attributed mainly to the 
condition of the Panama prisons.

  [Text] Kingston (NICA) -- Two Jamaicans, who died recently 
in Panama from an overdose of cocaine they were smuggling into 
Jamaica by swallowing it in plastic packets and condoms, have 
been identified. 
  Narcotics Police Division sources say they are David 
Sylvester Foster, 29, a higgler, who died on December 9 at the 
Aruba Hotel in Panama City, while preparing to catch a COPA 
flight to Jamaica. 
  Autopsy report shows that he died from an overdose of 
cocaine 
after a packet in which he had ingested the drug burst in his 
stomach. 
  The other victim has been identified as Yvette Tores, who 
died at the airport in Panama City on December 16. She fell ill 
as she was about to board a COPA flight for Jamaica and later 
died. 
  She too died of cocaine overdose when the plastic wrapping 
in 
which she swallowed the cocaine burst and poisoned her system, 
local Narcotics Police Division source said. Her body and that 
of Mr. Foster are still in Panama. 
  And an autopsy done at the Cornwall Regional Hospital in 
Montego Bay on December 22 on the body of Mrs. Sonia 
Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover, revealed that she too 
died of a cocaine overdose. When on December 9, she collapsed at 
Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay, aboard SAM flight 
506 on its arrival from San Andres, Colombia, five packets of 
cocaine were found in her brassiere. 
  The post-mortem examination on Tuesday showed that she had 
78 
packets of cocaine in her stomach. Also, an empty plastic 
wrapping was found in her stomach, indicating that it had come 
loose and the cocaine in it had killed her. 
  Cocaine experts say that "mules" hired to smuggle cocaine 
into Jamaica in their stomachs, usually swallow between 1 lb. 
and 1 1/2 lb of the drug. Medical experts roughly estimate the 
death-producing dose of cocaine to be 1.2 grams, but much 
smaller doses have been known to cause fatalities. A gram is 
roughly equivalent to the weight of a paper clip. When cocaine 
is ingested it disrupts the heart rhythm and depresses the 
respiratory centre, causing immediate death.

  [Excerpts] Culiacan, Sinaloa, 23 February -- The attorney 
general of the republic, Diego Valades Rios, declared: "The 
Mexican Government will not close its eyes to reality, nor deny 
the phenomenon of violence. However, skepticism claiming that 
crime cannot be defeated is not advisable either." [passage 
omitted] 
  He indicated that the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR] will maintain a single response for gaining 
society's confidence: working with resolve and integrity. By 
doing so, it will eventually succeed in addressing the demand 
for a reduction in crime. 
  He remarked that the efforts to combat the drug traffic, and 
to punish "money laundering," would be intensified "as an 
international commitment for Mexico." In the border zones, the 
Federal Judicial Police (PJF) and customs' agents will devote 
more effort to detecting smuggled firearms. They will go to 
great lengths to combat impunity, and will continue to oversee 
the conduct of PJF members and PGR employees. Moreover, those 
dismissed for committing crimes will not be reinstated. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for the battle against the drug traffic, he claimed that 
the statistics prove the country's effort in this regard, adding 
that, in response to Mexico's recommendation that the demand for 
drugs be attacked as well, the United States Government has 
announced changes in its strategy for eradicating drug 
consumption. [passage omitted] 
  Finally, he announced that the investigations of the 
assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo have made 
great progress: 35 persons have been arrested and brought to 
trial, and there are 13 arrest warrants to be executed.

  [Excerpts] Claiming that there are no privileges nor 
distinctions at the Almoloya de Juarez federal maximum security 
prison, and that all inmates have the same rights and 
obligations, this incarceration center's director, Juan Pablo de 
Tavira, emphasized: "It is quite likely that the campaign 
against this prison center is being financed by the leading drug 
trafficking `capos' held there, such as Miguel Angel Felix 
Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, and Rafael Caro Quintero, among 
others." 
  During a press conference held at the Government 
Secretariat's headquarters, De Tavira declared that the 
facilities of the "Number One Federal High Security Center," as 
the Almoloya federal prison is officially called, serve the 
purpose for which they were created. [passage omitted]. 
  The Almoloya de Juarez federal prison director commented on 
the press campaign conducted during recent weeks, with the 
publication of notices and the organization of informational 
events. He indicated that members of the Inter-American Human 
Rights Committee in Defense of Prison Inmates (CIDH-DIP), 
defense attorneys, and relatives of those held in the 
aforementioned prison, located in Mexico State, have taken part 
in these activities. 
  He remarked: "It is quite likely that this campaign against 
the operation of the Number One Federal High Security Center is 
being financed by the leading drug trafficking `capos.' They 
include, among others, persons such as Miguel Angel Felix 
Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael 
Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Gilberto Ontiveros 
Lucero. They are living at Almoloya under conditions far 
different from those that they had been enjoying at the centers 
from which they came, since there are no privileges nor 
distinctions here. All inmates have the same rights and 
obligations." [passage omitted] 
  The official noted that the one who has represented the 
inmates at the press conferences held at a capital hotel and at 
his office is the litigator, Efrain Garcia Ramirez. "He is an 
accredited attorney in the case records of the drug traffickers 
Rafael Caro Quintero, Rafael Arellano Felix, Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo, and Marcio Alvarez. The latter was also tried for the 
murder of the Jalisco prison director." 
  Furthermore, he stressed that the press conferences have 
been 
attended by the wives of the inmates Rafael Caro Quintero, Felix 
Gallardo, and Rafael Pardo Cardona, the latter "a Colombian 
associated with the Medellin Cartel." He added: "These subjects, 
with Garcia Ramirez, have been the only ones making statements." 
<H5>  CNDH Investigating Complaints </H5>
  He reported that the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH], 
the only constitutionally established agency, has conducted 
several investigations at that prison center, prompted by the 
large number of inmate complaints, "basically because of their 
transfers." He observed: "It has not made recommendations 
regarding any of the complaints. In fact, in two years and three 
months of operation with inmates, the prison has not had any 
human rights violations proven against it." [passage omitted] 
  He continued: "The required searches of relatives visiting 
inmates prevent the entry of drugs in the Almoloya Number One 
Center. Obviously, this situation is annoying, especially to 
inmates held here who are highly dangerous and financially 
powerful." 
  He explained that the searches are applied to the 
institution's personnel with the same stringency and, as a 
result, in two years and three months, there has not been a 
single case of drugs being brought into the prison. 
  He stated in conclusion that high security federal centers 
are a necessity in present-day Mexico, and in the battle against 
the drug traffic. "The drug trafficking inmates with great 
financial power will seek all means to hurt these institutions, 
by using associations without representative status, and 
lawyers. The presence of their relatives is understandable, but 
not justifiable."

  [Text] Tijuana, B.C., 24 February -- Today, the head of the 
Baja California Human Rights Prosecutor's Office, Jose Luis 
Perez Canchola, claimed: "The drug trafficking Mafia has taken 
control of certain organizations defending individual guarantees 
in some of the country's states," even offering financial aid to 
some of their members. 
  However, he maintained: "This is not disturbing, because 
civil society has become increasingly organized, and will not 
allow them to have their way." 
  This was his comment on the statements made by the director 
of the Almoloya de Juarez prison, Juan Pablo de Tavira, who 
charged that drug traffickers, through agencies of that type, 
are attempting to have the country's high security jails 
eliminated. 
  He declared: "It is obvious that, in places such as the 
Federal District and Mexico State, the drug trafficking Mafia 
has manipulated presumed human rights defenders, to plead in 
cases of persons arrested for crimes against health, or to call 
for the repeal of measures such as the establishment of high 
security prisons." However, he added: "They have no prospect of 
attaining their goals." 
  He also indicated that the state Congress might possibly 
confirm him in his position for another three years. Otherwise, 
he would accept the vice presidency of the Mexican Academy of 
Human Rights. 
  He indicated: "There is a large number of drug traffickers 
in 
custody, accounting for 30 percent of the prison population in 
the entire state."

  [Excerpts] Almost all the heroin produced illicitly in 
Mexico is smuggled into the United States. During 1992, the 
Mexican alkaloid accounted for approximately 23 percent of the 
drugs circulating on the U.S. black market: a proportion lower 
than 33 percent, the number reported in 1988. This announcement 
was made yesterday by Manuel Quijano, vice chairman of the UN's 
Internal Narcotics Inspection Board, upon submitting that 
agency's annual report. 
  At a press conference, he added that, during the past three 
years, a control program in Mexico also has reduced the illegal 
opium poppy crops to their lowest index in 10 years. During 
1992, the Mexican authorities reported the eradication of 11,583 
hectares of opium poppy plants. According to reports, opium 
production declined from seven tons in 1989 to four tons in 
1992. [passage omitted] 
  The Mexican authorities seized 38.8 tons of cocaine in 1992. 
It is estimated that 60 percent of the alkaloid entering the 
United States from Colombia passes through Mexico. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 24 February -- The Navy Secretariat 
will assign four superpowered speedboats permanently to 
reinforce the surveillance in the Caribbean zone, a route on 
which drug trafficking to the United States is occurring. This 
announcement was made here today by the commander of the gulf 
and Caribbean Sea Naval Force, Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza. 
  He reported that three of these four units (manufactured in 
New Orleans) are currently operating in the gulf and Caribbean 
area for a training phase. In March, they will initiate the 
permanent surveillance. 
  Saynez Mendoza revealed that, in the surveillance operations 
conducted in the Caribbean zone, an abandoned ship carrying 1.5 
tons of cocaine was detected. As a result, the vessel was turned 
over to the Cozumel Island sector, to be consigned to the 
pertinent authorities. 
  He claimed that drug trafficking by sea has declined 
considerably, although the Caribbean area is, of course, still a 
troubled area. It is considered a traditional route for the drug 
traffic from Central and South American countries to the United 
States. 
  Stressing that the majority of vessels come from Colombia, 
Venezuela, and the Grand Cayman Islands, where these boats are 
detected while attempting to transport the drugs to the border, 
he admitted that there are, of course, some of other 
nationalities. 
  He concluded by noting that, at present, the No. 51 patrol 
boat, Isla Coronado, the No. 52, Isla Lobos, and the No. 53, 
Isla Guadalupe, are in this port for a training period. It will 
be the No. 54 patrol boat, Isla Cozumel, that will be 
commissioned in March.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic [PGR] dealt the international drug traffic a severe 
blow by seizing 1.5 tons of cocaine, 8.7 tons of packed 
marijuana, 3.5 kg of heroin, and 1.2 kg of opium gum, with a 
combined worth of approximately 5 million new pesos. During the 
operations conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] forces in 
several of the Federation's states, 20 persons presumed guilty 
of crimes against health were arrested. 
  Eight vehicles used to commit these crimes were seized, 
including a speedboat employed to transport drugs. The 
confiscated drugs would have put 100 million doses into 
circulation. [passage omitted] 
  The PGR branch office in Sonora announced that, at the 
highway checkpoint (Precos) set up on the outskirts of the town 
of Hermosillo, Arturo Huerta Castaneda and Leopoldo Guzman 
Ortega were arrested. They were carrying 22 kg and 500 grams of 
cocaine on a Mexican Interstate Line passenger bus. The drugs 
were bound for the border at Tijuana, Baja California. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for marijuana, the largest seizure was made in the Sonora 
municipality of Benjamin Hill, at a highway checkpoint, where 
the PJF located a shipment of 5,595 kg of the grass. It had been 
packed and concealed in freight car 104533, owned by Ferronales, 
which was making the run between Guadalajara and Mexicali, Baja 
California. 
  The PGR's state branch office revealed that, as a result of 
an anonymous phone call reporting the transport of said 
shipment, the cannabis contained in 897 packages was confiscated. 
  Furthermore, federal agents arrested Jose Francisco Arevalo 
Alvarado, who was driving a Federal Public Service Torton truck 
bearing the firm name "Autotransportes Valladolid," with 
domicile in Morelia, Michoacan. The vehicle was stopped when its 
load was noted to be overweight. The driver claimed to be 
carrying earthenware to the town of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. 
However, during the inspection 78 packages of cannabis were 
found, with a gross weight of two tons and 727 grams. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] The weekend proved fruitful for the Federal 
Judicial Police, whose antidrug operations, conducted in nine 
states, resulted in the seizure of four tons and 556 kg of 
packed marijuana (estimated as worth 12 million new pesos), and 
the capture of 29 presumed drug dealers. 
  The PGR's [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] 
Michoacan State branch office, headed by Luis Aguilar, reported 
the largest confiscation, totaling 1,375 kg of marijuana, near 
the municipality of Apatzingan. Julio Cesar Cisneros Corona and 
Gerardo Andrade Alcazar were captured while carrying the drugs 
in a tractor trailer truck. 
  Found in a secret compartment in the body of a Kenworth 
trailer truck, which was riveted and covered with a layer of 
asphalt, were 445 packages of various weights and sizes, holding 
the aforementioned total amount of drugs. 
  The other operations were carried out in Sonora, Sinaloa, 
Baja California, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo 
Leon, and Coahuila. [passage omitted].

  [Text] Over 50 kg of the chemical precursor, ephedrine, 
worth more than 300,000 new pesos on the narcotics black market, 
was confiscated by the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic. This was achieved through an operation conducted in 
the town of Tijuana, Baja California, during which Federal 
Judicial Police agents captured two presumed drug dealers 
attempting to smuggle the shipment into the United States. 
  The ephedrine, a chemical component essential for processing 
cocaine base and producing amphetamines, was being transported 
by Martin Flores and Carlos Denis Diaz, who had received the 
product from Guadalajara, Jalisco. There is another individual 
implicated in trafficking with this drug, named "Ezequiel," who 
is now being sought by federal agents. 
  The drugs were located in the parcel section of the Tijuana 
Bus Terminal. The two presumed drug dealers went there, picking 
up the drugs to be delivered and later smuggled into the United 
States. 
  When making their preliminary statements, the subjects under 
arrest admitted that this was the fifth time that they had 
engaged in this type of work, claiming that they were each to 
receive $500 for the service. 
  The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office ordered a detailed 
investigation to locate the one or more owners of the chemical, 
which is used for the so-called "cuts" in cocaine, providing the 
drug with a greater stimulating potential. 
  Based on the investigations being conducted by the social 
representative, it will be determined today whether the two 
presumed accused have connections with cocaine distribution 
rings established in Mexico and the United States.

  [Text] In what constitutes one of the most significant 
blows dealt to the organized drug traffic thus far this year, 
agents from the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
destroyed approximately 580,000 square meters of marijuana 
crops. The drug plants, interspersed with corn on a farm known 
as Mumucuera, in the Sonora municipality of Navojoa, would have 
produced slightly over 40 tons of the drug. 
  This announcement was made by the office's representative in 
the state, Fausto Destenave Kuri, who reported that more than 2 
million drug plants, of the types known as "lamb's tail" and 
"lemon-lime," were destroyed manually. Backing was provided by 
Mexican Army, and both State Judicial and Municipal Police 
personnel. 
  He added that, based on a series of investigations, Federal 
Judicial Police agents assigned to the state, under orders from 
the deputy representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, detected 
several marijuana plantations three km from the Km Six by-pass 
of the Navojoa-Huatabampo highway. They were located on an earth 
fill road, "protruding" from a corn crop. 
  When the forces invaded the farm, they observed that the 
marijuana was interspersed with corn, and that the crop's 
dimensions were of considerable size. Therefore, an inspection 
by topographical experts and reconnaissance flights over the 
zone by military personnel were required. It was determined that 
the farm had been divided into six plots, on an approximate area 
of 58 hectares. 
  Destenave Kuri noted that, a few days earlier, the local 
office headed by him had received reports concerning the 
presence of armed persons on that site, as well as an unusual 
movement of vehicles through the region. 
  During an operation conducted on the farm known as 
Mumucuera, 
it was discovered that the plants had reached a height of 
one-two meters, with a density of four per square meter. This 
land was supplied with water through a complex irrigation 
system, consisting of pumps to extract the vital liquid and 
hoses. 
  The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, for its part, 
stressed that, on the borders of the plantations, six camps were 
found, supplied with food, bedding, and cots. There were two 
dryers for the drugs, as well as bags of fertilizer and 
insecticides, fumigation pumps, shovels, hoes, plastic drums, 
and other household equipment. 
  The participation of Federal Judicial Police personnel was 
required to destroy the marijuana crops. They began uprooting 
all the plants for subsequent incineration. 
  Finally, the representative of the Attorney General's Office 
in the state remarked that preliminary investigation 
029/94-Obregon-III, initiated after these incidents, now 
contains data on the likely owners of that land and of the 
drugs. Criminal action will be taken against them for crimes 
against health in the form of planting and cultivation, and any 
other forms proven to exist.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara's government has 
approved, through an Executive decree, the obligation of every 
person who enters the country to declare under oath how much 
cash or liquid assets they are bringing with them. According to 
the decree, the measure will control the entrance of fiduciary 
money, "since right now, a great many people enter the nation 
with large amounts of cash and other assets and no one knows 
their origin or destination." 
  Several weeks ago, DEA agents in the United States said 
Panama cooperated more in the fight against drug trafficking 
during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military dictatorship than the 
current democratic government. 
  According to a Presidency press bulletin, the government 
order seeks to safeguard the principles ruling the International 
Financial Center operating in Panama and to prevent the 
fraudulent entrance of ill gotten cash and other valuables. In 
this regard, the document indicates that "although our 
legislation does not prohibit the entrance and exit of cash and 
other liquid assets, it is advisable to safeguard the Panamanian 
banking center's principles. This assures that passengers 
entering the nation with cash and other assets, that the cash 
and assets have legal origins and are not the product of illegal 
drug trafficking." 
  The government said the Customs Directorate will be 
responsible for enforcing the decree as well as punishing the 
violators. Forms, therefore will be drawn up to read: 
"Traveler's Sworn Statement," in which the person, national or 
foreigner, will declare his assets. 
  Yesterday, members of the National Banking Association 
pointed out that the initiative can be healthy, but only as a 
precautionary measure as it is very difficult to prevent money 
laundering. Meanwhile, others said the measures could cause the 
number of attacks on tourists to increase as the amount of cash 
being brought in will be known.

<F P=106> [Report by Roxana Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Jesus Sierra, the legal adviser to the Legislative 
Assembly Drug Committee, has reported that the DEA operation to 
uncover an alleged Panama-based drug trafficking and money 
laundering organization was geared to finding and seizing 
foreign exchange offices, credit companies, stock market 
operations, and [legal] offices that formed private companies in 
our country through letters of credit. 
  After gathering information on the alleged participation of 
Panamanian citizens in this criminal case, the legal adviser 
reported to the legislators on the Drug Committee and said no 
government official is involved in this case up to now. Jesus 
Sierra said the investigation, which, according to U.S. federal 
agencies, began more than two years ago, has not concluded and 
added that no Panamanian Government official appears to be 
involved in the case under investigation. 
  He emphasized that the DEA operation, which discovered the 
drug trafficking and money laundering organization in Panama, 
worked to find and seize foreign exchange offices, credit 
companies, stock market operators, and [legal] offices that 
formed private companies in our country through letters of 
credit to find out if they were involved in criminal activities. 
  Sierra said the DEA has a solid and strong case and has not 
yet concluded its investigation. Thus, he said, we will have to 
wait until the investigation ends to determine whether 
government officials have participated in those illegal 
activities. 
  Concluding, the official reported that he is preparing a 
file 
on this notorious case containing all the information he 
gathered during his trip to Tampa, Florida. 
  Jesus Sierra also gave information on Legislator Anel 
Ramirez, who is held in a Tampa jail on alleged drug trafficking 
charges. He said Ramirez had changed lawyers and appointed 
Richard Everst as his legal representative in the trial against 
him which will start in April.

  [Text] Edna Ramos, defense attorney for Legislator Anel 
Ramirez, currently under custody in Tampa, Florida, has said her 
client is unequivocally innocent. The U.S. Government has 
accused Ramirez of conspiracy to introduce drugs into that 
country. 
  "Our client is definitely innocent. He was manipulated by 
U.S. undercover agents, and that will be corroborated in due 
time by Ivan Fisher, the attorney who is handling the case in 
the United States," Ramos has explained. 
  After stating Legislator Ramirez must not be stripped of his 
parliamentary immunity, Ramos added there is absolutely no 
documented evidence his client has committed an offense in our 
country. 
  When questioned on the fact Ramirez is being investigated 
both in the United States and in our country, Ramos said 
Panamanian law mandates when it is presumed or feared an offense 
has been committed in the country, the Attorney General's Office 
must begin an investigation. 
  "Regarding this case in particular, in which a personality 
of 
the significance of Anel Ramirez is involved, it is first 
necessary, however, for the Attorney General's Office to provide 
sufficient evidence to initiate a case. And in this process, as 
will be known later, there is really no merit. There is not 
enough juridical grounds to begin a case, an investigation. 
They have not even mentioned witnesses. Moreover, in this 
process Anel Ramirez is the only detainee," Ramos has said. 
  After explaining her client, Anel Ramirez, did not deliver 
drugs or money, Ramos said undercover agents did everything. 
She stressed Legislator Ramirez' participation has not even 
been determined. 
  Ramos has said there are not even alleged coconspirators, as 
judges in the United States have determined. They have not been 
arrested, nor has their situation been established.

Chile] 
  [Text] The United States has asked Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy to be "prudent" in handling peasant 
problems, bearing in mind recent social outbursts in the 
continent, as in the Mexican region of Chiapas. During his 
meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for 
inter-American affairs, Wasmosy acknowledged the situation but 
at the same time lashed out at peasant leaders, stating that 
they spend their time blocking roads but do not plant a single 
square meter of cotton. Watson also asked the Paraguayan 
Government to explain why U.S. troops and materiel were not 
allowed to enter Paraguay. 
  The U.S. Government is closely following recent problems 
with 
Paraguayan peasants. These problems are a source of some 
concern, given the social outbursts that have taken place in 
Latin America, namely in Santiago del Estero Province in 
Argentina, in Chiapas Province in Mexico, and in some Central 
American nations to a lesser degree. 
  Assistant Secretary Watson clarified certain controversial 
items that had caused some tension in Paraguayan-U.S. relations, 
asked President Wasmosy for caution and prudence in dealing with 
the demands of Paraguayan peasants, and advocated dialogue and 
consensus between the parties involved. 
  Wasmosy admitted that the high-ranking U.S. official had 
indicated that the peasant problem should be handled very 
carefully, and reported that he explained to Watson that the 
people blocking roads were not exactly peasants. "I told him 
that the people who are blocking the roads are leaders who have 
not planted any cotton themselves. There are, however, some 
peasants who -- because of low productivity -- will not be able 
to recover from three years of bad crops, even if the price of 
cotton hits 850 guaranies per kilogram," Wasmosy said. 
  Wasmosy also reiterated his pet argument that in the 
framework of a free market economy it was not up to the 
government to set the price of cotton. 
  Asked about the U.S. reaction to the conditions that the 
Paraguayan Government had set to admit U.S. troops, Wasmosy 
answered that the doors are open to any joint exercise with the 
Paraguayan Army and civilians, "provided it does not violate any 
constitutional principles. I believe that we made this very 
clear and he (Watson) was very satisfied," Wasmosy added. 
  President Wasmosy stated that the U.S. State Department 
official wanted to know firsthand the official report on the 
aborted military operation that the United States had asked to 
be allowed to conduct in the area of San Pedro. It would seem 
that Watson listened to this report carefully, as it may have a 
bearing on any further U.S. military assistance to Paraguay. 
  Watson also reiterated that the U.S. Government is still 
concerned over the evidence it has that Paraguay continues to be 
a key link in regional drug trafficking. "I told him that we 
need help, training, and resources, to fight drug trafficking," 
Wasmosy said. He emphasized that Washington's envoy heard out 
the concerns of the Paraguayan Government and will relay them to 
the appropriate U.S. drug enforcement officials. 
  Together with the other chiefs of state who have arrived in 
Santiago, Wasmosy went to Valparaiso at noon on 11 February to 
attended President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle's installation. 
  President Wasmosy will return at approximately 1500 local 
time today together with OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente 
Baena Soares. There is no official information on the agenda of 
Baena Soares in Paraguay.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Luis Alberto Chavez and photographer </F>
Cesar Aquije] 
  [Excerpt] General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros has replaced 
General Eduardo Bellido Mora, currently assigned to Israel, as 
commander of the Huallaga Front. He handles the last refuge of 
subversion and the natural habitat of drug traffickers: the San 
Martin and Huanuco Departments. This is an explosive zone but 
he is not worried because in some ways he knows the situation: 
"El Cholo," as he is known, was the political-military chief of 
Cerro de Pasco before being assigned to Upper Huallaga. 
  Although he did not elaborate, when asked about accusations 
that the Army is linked with trafficking, the general said he 
was inflexible over detecting and sanctioning any cases of 
immorality in his institution. 
  If there were any doubts about his intentions, a few days 
after taking over the Huallaga Front command he sanctioned an 
officer. It was a warning for everyone. 
  It is incredible but Rodriguez Riveros is ready to show -- 
papers in hand -- that not a single light plane has entered the 
Upper Huallaga zone so far this year. Daily DEA reports confirm 
it. 
  He said that although the Army was responsible for 
coordinating the struggle against trafficking, he was not in 
charge of direct interventions. The police have that 
responsibility. 
  Today that situation has changed. In October 1993, a decree 
was issued stating that in emergency zones the Army fights 
subversion and drug trafficking. 
  All antinarcotics operations by any of the forces in Upper 
Huallaga (National Police, Air Force, or DEA) must be previously 
cleared with the Huallaga Front commander. No operation is 
authorized without Army coordination. 
  "The control of drug trafficking is today an objective," 
said 
Gen. Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros during this interview that was 
arranged in principle as "a conversation," but which thanks to 
his kindness was authorized for publication. 
  Chavez: Army members have been accused of 
maintaining contacts with drug traffickers. What is your 
opinion on these charges? 
  Rodriguez: The commander reacted positively. Last 
year we had three inspections. This year we will have four. 
Perhaps out of fear, mistakes used to occur internally, within 
the units. Each commander had his policy and made his own 
decisions on penalties against his troops and on how to correct 
wrongdoings. This policy changed in 1992 and 1993. Officers 
are no longer reported to their commanders within the larger 
units, they are reported to the Army Inspector's Office and then 
to the Military Justice Supreme Council. 
  Chavez: How many cases are being investigated in 
the Huallaga Front? 
  Rodriguez: We have already investigated 15 cases. 
These cases are duly documented and ready for sentencing. The 
sentence will vary according to the degree of participation: 
They may be removed from the Army, placed at the disposal of the 
commander, retired, or referred to civilian courts. 
  Chavez: Have you reported any cases since you were 
appointed as the Huallaga Front political and military chief? 
  Rodriguez: Yes. I reported a case 24 hours after I 
discovered it. The problem was an old one, but we detected it. 
Our commander is aware of the case and documents are being 
prepared for his trial. 
  Chavez: Who is he? 
  Rodriguez: An officer. We caught him in the 
simplest of ways. He was attending a meeting outside the base 
and we looked for him because he left the base. During the 
investigation we learned that the officer "met" with a group (of 
drug traffickers). The rest followed this lead. I am unable to 
give you his name because he is still on trial. 
  Let us just say this was a message for all officers assigned 
to the Upper Huallaga front. 
  I think we have all come here with the same spirit: To work 
for our fatherland and to work for our institution. 
  Chavez: In other words, a war with a loud warning 
does not kill people. 
  Rodriguez: That is right. 
  Chavez: How do you detect an officer involved in 
trafficking? Only through the inspectors? 
  Rodriguez: There are various ways. One is through 
his lifestyle. With our salaries we cannot have certain 
luxuries. These people are also known for the way they talk. We 
are not isolated from society. We participate in all social 
activities and social meetings. Another way to detect them is 
by the way they brag about the money they have. This prompts us 
to investigate. 
  Chavez: General, is this a certain "esprit de 
corps," seeking to cover up the mistakes made by some officer? 
  Rodriguez: This command has never allowed that to 
happen for ethical reasons. We will not cover up for anyone. 
Our commanders understand that trafficking is a scourge we must 
eliminate. That was the reason behind the law authorizing us to 
directly intervene in the fight to eliminate trafficking. 
  Chavez: What can you do to prevent further 
corruption? 
  Rodriguez: It is very difficult to be inside every 
officer's head. We are implementing measures, for example, by 
rotating duties. We think it is harmful for an officer to stay 
too long at one particular base. The social interaction with 
people in the zone could make him feel secure and might tempt 
him to get involved in illegal activities. 
  Chavez: What can you tell us about the illegal 
drug trade? Is it moving somewhere else? 
  Rodriguez: We have information that trafficking 
activities are gradually moving toward Loreto and Madre de Dios, 
that is, outside San Martin and Huanuco. We no longer see 
opulence in shopping malls. We see abandoned towns. Tocache 
and Uchiza used to be trafficking centers, today these towns 
lack the economic resources to continue to develop. 
  Chavez: So trafficking is moving to Loreto and 
Madre de Dios? 
  Rodriguez: Yes, at least according to the 
information we have. We work day and night to detect light 
planes. 
  Chavez: With what results? 
  Rodriguez: Results have been negative lately. 
They no longer come to this area. If they do, it is not like 
in the past, that is, three to four times a day. They come once 
a month and run the risk of being caught. 
  Chavez: How can you be sure if the Army does not 
have the adequate technological means to detect light planes 
flying at night, which is when traffickers move? 
  Rodriguez: We work with the DEA. They can detect 
planes with their radar in Yurimaguas. They transmit the 
information to the Huallaga Front and we re-transmit it to the 
base closest to where the plane might land. 
  Chavez: Does that mean the DEA tells you the exact 
moment a small plane enters Upper Huallaga? 
  Rodriguez: Yes, it takes us an average of two 
minutes to learn about it. 
  Chavez: Do you depend on information supplied by 
the DEA? 
  Rodriguez: That's right. 
  Chavez: How often do you receive DEA reports? 
  Rodriguez: Daily. 
  Chavez: How many small planes enter the region 
daily? 
  Rodriguez: Currently, none enters this region. 
This is why we are seeking other possible routes (ground and 
river routes) for drug trafficking. 
  Chavez: The people, however, say that they see 
small planes entering the region. 
  Rodriguez: Well, they may say planes arrive here 
all the time. It may have occurred previously. 
  Chavez: According to your reports, when did the 
last plane enter the region? 
  Rodriguez: We do not have this data. 
  Chavez: Are you telling me that so far this year 
no plane has entered the Upper Huallaga region? 
  Rodriguez: That's right. 
  Chavez: Are you sure? 
  Rodriguez: I repeat, according to our reports, no 
plane has entered the region. They are probably seeking other 
routes. Probably along rivers or roads. In the 90 days we have 
been here, no flights or large shipments have been reported. 
  Chavez: Do you think the Intelligence Service is 
mistaken, general? 
  Rodriguez: I don't think so. 
  Chavez: What do you believe is the main 1994 
problem: The Shining Path or trafficking? 
  Rodriguez: They go together. In the field of 
subversion two areas interest us: Sisa and Tingo Maria. 
Although we have temporarily neutralized Sisa, we want to 
clearly identify the group to be able to dismantle it. This, 
however, does not apply to Tingo Maria in Leoncio Prado 
Province, where there are permanent clashes. Both sides have 
casualties. It will take some time to resolve. The problem 
will not disappear in the near future, but we are sure we will 
finally eliminate them. 
  Chavez: President Fujimori said in Colombia that 
the millions of dollars invested by the United States in the 
antinarcotics effort have yielded no results. What do you think 
of that? 
  Rodriguez: Considering the actions so far, I could 
not comment on the issue. I have been here for too short a 
time. Talking with the people who live here, however, I have 
learned that they believe funds should not be allocated to the 
antinarcotics effort but to the coca replacement program. Rice, 
yerbaluisa, corn and grapes are the most promising products in 
the region. Grapes, for example, are harvested three times in a 
year here while near the coast they are harvested only once. 
This occurs at the Cumbaza Valley, where grapes are harvested 
three times a year. That is why coca is not planted there. 
  Chavez: Do you believe that in addition to being 
an economic, police, and moral problem, coca growing is also a 
social problem? 
  Rodriguez: Yes, but this problem can be solved by 
helping the most needy people and by bringing together all 
institutions in an effort to find solutions to their problems. 
Those who told us they were ignorant and that as a result grew 
coca, can now improve by growing more profitable products. 
  Chavez: Do you believe peasants grow coca because 
they are ignorant? 
  Rodriguez: Not because they are ignorant. I 
believe that at a certain moment they were pressed to do it and 
that for a while it was the most profitable crop. 
  Chavez: What about poppies? 
  Rodriguez: We have been patrolling the forest for 
30 days looking for the sites where poppies were allegedly being 
grown. We have found nothing but we will continue to look.

  [Text] Lima, 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Lima newspaper LA 
REPUBLICA reported today that the Peruvian Army has denounced a 
smear campaign using all "national and international media in an 
improper exercise of freedom of the press." 
  According to a document sent to this newspaper entitled 
"Disloyalty, Immorality, and Corruption Do Not Exist in the 
Peruvian Army," the military said the institution is being 
presented "as a systematic violator of human rights, in 
collusion with drug trafficking gangs, and as an institution 
with internal problems." 
  The military also says 1994 "will be a very difficult year 
from a social and political point of view because it is a 
pre-electoral year. We cannot rule out the possibility that the 
propaganda campaign to smear the Army will intensify even more 
starting in the second half of 1994," the document says. 
  The latest issue of the weekly magazine SI that hit the 
stands today denounces that the political military command in 
Northern Huallaga Valley in 1992 "ordered an operation to cover 
up the activities of drug traffickers that resulted in the death 
of eight civilians and a complicated trial in military courts." 
  The publication says that on 29 October 1992 a military 
patrol intercepted eight individuals, two of them Colombians, 
transporting 150 kg of cocaine paste. According to SI, the drug 
traffickers offered $30,000 to pass. However, the next day the 
eight individuals appeared dead while the drugs disappeared. 
  The magazine says the case was later presented as an 
anti-subversive operation or a settling of accounts between drug 
traffickers and terrorists. Military justice is looking into the 
matter.

  [Text] Three Colombian and one Peruvian drug trafficking 
rings (involving the Cachique Rivera brothers) were using the 
landing strip of the "El Diamante" native community in the town 
of Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios Department, when a large 
consignment of drugs was seized on 26 February. 
  The three Colombian "firms" are headed by Colombians known 
as 
"Pablo" or "Pablito," "Caballo," and "Duro." 
  The Peruvian organization is headed by the Cachique Rivera 
brothers. 
  The shipment of 3,653 kg of washed cocaine paste, wrapped in 
75 bags, was seized in the aforementioned location. 
  The drug had been stockpiled in underground "caches" in the 
jungle near the 1,800-meter landing strip of "El Diamante," 
ready to be loaded into small planes bound for Colombia. 
  The route currently used by the Colombian "narcopilots" 
includes Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Brazilian air space and 
the city of Cruzeiro, near Ucayali, are used by Colombian mafia 
organizations to ship the drugs to Colombia. 
  The "traffickers" take this route to elude the Yurimaguas 
radar and the possibility of being pursued by the Peruvian Air 
Force T-27 planes that patrol Peruvian air space in Upper 
Huallaga. 
  Intelligence sources have shown that traffickers have moved 
to areas like Apurimac Department and the jungle edges in 
Ayacucho, Pasco, Cusco, and Madre de Dios Departments because of 
the interdiction activities by the Peruvian forces of order. 
  Traffickers take the drug which is stockpiled in the 
production areas in Upper Huallaga, Aguaytia, Ucayali, Pozuzo, 
Pichis Palcazu, Oxapampa (Pasco Department) and Palmapampa 
(Ayacucho Department), to shipment areas where it is worth more. 
  Air, land, and river transportation are used to reach the 
shipment "points." 
  From the shipment areas -- one of which was "El Diamante," 
Boca del Manu, in Madre de Dios Department -- the drugs are 
taken to Colombia aboard small Colombian planes. 
  The 13 traffickers detained on 26 February during a combined 
operation were interrogated yesterday by the Antidrug Division 
(Dinandro) of the Peruvian National Police.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vaticano's Network"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the purist Cali Cartel style, the web of the 
relationships of the organization headed by Vaticano covers 
every flank -- financial, police, military, terrorist, judicial, 
and operational. 
  A comparison of information from various sources has made it 
possible to determine the table of organization that is detailed 
on these pages. It is very striking to see the levels of 
closeness since apparently even the agents of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been the subject of 
intelligence leaks pertaining precisely to the control 
operations carried out in Huallaga. 
  One of the brothers of Vaticano (so-called because he is the 
head of all of the "churches," or firms), namely Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera (aka Lan Chile), was the man in charge of the 
"payments" made to the military. This was because his work -- 
the coordination of the receipt and dispatch of drugs by air -- 
could only be carried out in this way. One of these payments may 
have been the gray automobile delivered to a general whose 
involvement in this relationship has been proven,, according to 
reliable information. Elias, who was formerly in charge of 
logistics in Campanilla, is now reported to have replaced his 
brother and to be in Cali. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  "I Know Nothing" </H5>
  The statement "I am his brother, but I know nothing," which 
was made by Manuel, the brother of Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, at 
the time of his arrest, has become famous. 
  Vaticano has said the following about his brothers: 
  "...Humberto lives in Campanilla, and he devotes his time to 
livestock breeding and music. He has a group called "La Banda 
del Caribe" (The Caribbean Band). Emilio lives in Campanilla, 
and is engaged in farming and livestock breeding. Berzabeth 
lives in Campanilla. She devotes herself to her housekeeping, 
and is married to a former policeman, Silverio Cardenas. Bertha 
lives in Lima and works in a grocery. Elias lives in Campanilla, 
but I do not know what he does." Where the others are concerned, 
he says that he has not seen them in a long time. 
  His sister Bertha, for her part, also said in her statement 
to the police that "I have not seen my brother for more than 10 
years now." 
  But her relationships were business ones, even more than 
family ones. Bertha (La Calena) was the general director of the 
organization, and she was apparently in charge of the process of 
laundering the money. The operations of "LR y Asociados" (LR and 
Associates) are being traced in an effort to prove this. 
  This business, which was established in March of 1992 by 
Mrs. 
Lucila Emetria Rivera de la Cruz, a housewife (55,100 shares), 
and her daughter, Claudia Luna Victoria Rivera, a student (2,900 
shares), was engaged in the construction of commercial centers 
in Lima. Vaticano has said that in May of 1991, he sold a plot 
of land measuring 1,100 square meters that he had purchased in 
Block 51 of the Benavides Extension, Surco, "to a woman whose 
name I do not remember." 
  This woman was none other than the mother-in-law of his 
sister Bertha. Mrs. Lucila Emetria is the mother of Marcos Ivan 
Luna Victoria Rivera, Bertha's common-law husband, who also 
lived at Bertha's minimarket and home complex at 3373 Avenida 
Aviacion. Her son was sentenced this week to 12 years in prison 
by the First Criminal Court of Callao for illegal trafficking in 
drugs. "La Calena" has told the police that she never realized 
she was living with a drug trafficker. 
<H5>  Figureheads </H5>
  Having set up their business in the commercial center they 
had built on the 1,100-meter plot in question, the mother and 
daughter hired a manager, Yuri Marcel Munoz Rivera. He too is 
one of Mrs. Lucila Emetria's sons, and, having been linked with 
Luna Victoria in this way might also have played other roles. 
  In the first place, it has been proven that he visited 
"Panama," Bertha's minimarket on Avenida Aviacion. In November 
of last year, he traveled to Trujillo. There he is reported to 
have collected money (the sum of $40,000 has been mentioned), 
which he brought back to Lima and delivered to his sister 
Terlinda. She made a trip to Iquitos, presumably to pay off 
Judge Jaime Cardenas Fonseca, the brother of "Mosca Loca" (Crazy 
Fly), for the release of Bertha. It was Vaticano, who met with 
Terlinda in Iquitos for purposes of coordination, who gave the 
order for the operation. 
  LR y Asociados SRL (LR and Associates, Ltd.) built the "Las 
Gardenias" commercial center on the plot of land purchased from 
Vaticano, and leased all of the shops. In this way, the property 
(land and buildings) was valued at more than $1 million. In 
1992, however, LR sold the entire complex to two men for a 
little more than $100,000. And the land alone had cost $65,000 
when they bought it from Demetrio. 
  It is suspected that this unusual sale was made as a means 
of 
laundering the money obtained from Huallaga. 
  A short time thereafter, the business purchased another plot 
of land two blocks farther along. On that plot, the company 
built the "53 Shopping Center," in which 79 shops have been 
offered for lease thus far. The sales manager chosen on this 
occasion was Elias Rojas Boltan. 
<H5>  The Polvos Rosados Trade Fair </H5>
  Terlinda's trip to Iquitos was not the only one she would 
make. She traveled to Arica, Chile, in May of 1993 (Vaticano 
said she left Peru via Tacna-Arica). And in November of that 
year, she made another trip to Medellin, Colombia, where she 
stayed at the Hotel Capitolio. 
  A number of telephone calls were made from her home, located 
in Unit A at 4660 Avenida Arequipa, in Miraflores, to Cali, 
Colombia. The calls were made to the "Holguines" development 
company, to Maria Escobar, to Jairo Frisneda Granada, and to 
Enrique Rocha. 
  The trip to Medellin was nothing unusual, although it is 
known that this was the headquarters of Escobar's cartel, and 
there were sometimes dealings between the two. Proof of this is 
the presence of Juan Chavez Penaherrera, one of the brothers, in 
that city from time to time "on business." 
  Terlinda also managed Booth 151 in Polvos Rosados. Although 
this seems to have happened infrequently, this trade fair also 
served as a meeting place for the members of the organization. 
It is known that Berzabeth, the other sister of Vaticano who was 
arrested, had some booths there. 
  In order to understand the operational plan of the 
commercial 
"facade" completely and to establish further links, a total of 
180 homes and offices throughout Lima, including those of a 
number of offices of aviation companies that make flights into 
the jungle, are being investigated.

  The Guangzhou Baiyun Airport Authority has cracked its first 
heroin case this year. At about 1600 on 24 February, the 
airport security station learned that a passenger called Dong on 
Flight 6322 from Dalian to Guangzhou was carrying drugs. At 
about 1800, accompanied by a female passenger called Yang, Dong 
arrived. A bag containing heroin was found in their biscuit tin 
and another two bags in Yang's gym shoes. From information 
provided by Yang, an accomplice called Qiao on board Flight 5320 
from Shanghai to Guangzhou was identified. The three criminals 
have now been transferred to the public security department for 
further examination. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE

  Chengdu police recently cracked a large drug-trafficking 
case, seizing 26.9 kg of heroin and arresting 18 criminals. On 
28 August 1993, police in Jinmu District, Chengdu learned of a 
gang engaged in drug trafficking. Police investigating the case 
were joined by another special police team, organized by the 
provincial, city, and district public security departments, 
taking the number of policemen on the case to over 100. The 
case was finally settled after over 170 days of efforts. The 
gang comprised elements from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong. 
Since the first half of 1992, acting in league with overseas 
drug traffickers, it had conducted drug-trafficking and 
smuggling activities on several occasions, making several 
million yuan profit. Also confiscated were five imported luxury 
cars, over 1 million yuan, a number of weapons, ammunition, and 
drug-processing equipment. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN

<F P=106> [Report by Zhang Weihang (1728 5898 5300): "Public Security </F>
Organs Across China Attained Remarkable Results in Fighting 
Crime in 1993"] 
  [Text] Public security organs nationwide scored great 
successes in fighting crime last year, with a sharp rise in the 
detection rate. 
  According to information provided by the Public Security 
Ministry's Criminal Investigation Bureau, China's public 
security organs last year cracked 1.21 million criminal cases 
occurring in the same year, of which 370,000 cases were serious 
and important ones, with the detection rates going up by 6.8 and 
3 percent, respectively, as compared with the previous year. A 
number of felons were arrested and a total of 3.95 billion yuan 
in cash and goods were recovered. 
  Acting on the plan made by the Public Security Ministry, 
public security organs in various localities launched a series 
of campaigns in 1993 against train robbers and highwaymen, 
criminal gangs, criminals involved in abducting and selling 
women and children, drug and firearms traffickers, economic 
criminals, smugglers and snakeheads [traffickers in illegal 
emigrants], and those engaged in transnational and transregional 
criminal activities. They scored great successes and thus made 
significant contributions to social security. In 1993, 21,000 
"train and highway banditry" cases and a number of cases of 
abducting and selling women and children were solved. Some 
4,000 kg of heroin and 3,000 kg of opium were seized in the 
course of 14,000 cases, and a number of criminal gangs were 
broken up. In another development, public security organs in 
various localities detected a number of serious and important 
economic cases, prosecuted a number of criminals involved in 
transnational and transregional criminal cases, and extradited 
20 felons from foreign countries or from outside the borders. 
  It has been learned that the Public Security Ministry has 
called on public security organs in various localities to focus 
on "identifying serious cases, cracking down on criminal gangs, 
and pursuing escaped criminals," so as to continue following the 
principle of dealing harsh and quick blows against serious 
crimes. They should double their efforts to crack down on 
murderers, robbers, thieves, and organized criminal activities 
in order to eliminate evil forces in urban and rural areas, and 
should truly maintain social security and stability, thus 
creating a more favorable social environment for reform and 
economic construction, as demanded by the Public Security 
Ministry.

<F P=106> [Article by Mu Yi (2606 2496) and Mu Zi (2606 1311): "After </F>
75 Days, Through Province and Prefecture, Crossing Up to 10,000 
km, Our Brave Drug Enforcement Police Ultimately Apprehend Drug 
Dealers--Guangxi's Number One Drug Enforcement Case In 1993"] 
  [Text] 1. A street corner ambush 
  Noon. 8 September 1993. 
  In the busiest part of central Nanning, the capital of 
Guangxi, Gonghe Road was as busy as usual, with people going to 
or returning from work. The bustling about was never-ending. 
  In front of the Telecommunications Bureau, an ordinary 
looking middle-aged man was squatting on his heels by a flight 
of steps, reading a newspaper. At a small cigarette booth to the 
left, a young man was haggling with the vendor over a slight 
rise in the price. Over 40 meters away, another young man was 
angry that his motorcycle was leaking oil. Two more young men 
were wiping away their perspiration with napkins, while 
complaining of the "too hot weather", and drinking from cans of 
chilled honey peach juice.... 
  At 1240, a man in a T-shirt driving a woman's red "Haomai" 
brand motorcycle, with a fine black combination lock briefcase 
on its back, sped out of a small lane into Gonghe road, and 
rapidly proceeded north along Gonghe Road. 
  Just at that moment, the middle-aged man who had been 
reading 
his newspaper stood up, seemingly aimlessly. Rolling up the 
newspaper, he slapped it twice against his palm. At once, the 
people who had been buying cigarettes, repairing the motorcycle, 
or having cold drinks all got on their motorcycles, and followed 
the red "Haomai" motorcycle. 
  At that time, the man was radiant with happiness and 
immensely proud. Less than 20 minutes before, he had reached 
agreement with a big businessman from Guangzhou on a "deal" 
which had earned him several hundred thousand yuan in less than 
two days! With the money in his wallet, he was proud and happy, 
feeling as if he were suddenly sitting on a gold mountain. 
  But it didn't last long. He saw that a car ahead of him was 
disabled, and with a lot of police "checking" there, he said to 
himself that it was "a collision--bad luck," and rapidly turned 
towards the intersection of Gonghe Road and Beining Street, 
trying to sneak away. But the five motorcyclists following him 
just surrounded him in the center of the road. Two strong young 
men jumped upon him from both sides, and handcuffed him tightly. 
  Another young man quickly seized the black briefcase, took a 
fast look at the lock and with rapid and practiced movements 
opened, and then immediately closed it, a scornful smile on his 
face. 
  The man suddenly changed from looking immensely proud to 
deathly pale, and began to sweat. He then was unable to stand, 
and collapsed. 
  "Take him away!" 
  The entire arresting process had taken only three minutes. 
It 
was over so quickly that bystanders were still unaware of what 
had happened. 
  As recently as just one month before, the Nanning Municipal 
Public Security Bureau (PSB) received some intelligence: Someone 
was selling large quantities of highly concentrated heroin in 
the metropolitan area. With perfect arrangements and controls, 
and after a 72 hour stakeout, the scene in the street occurred. 
  The man reading the newspaper was the head of the drug 
enforcement squad of the Nanning PSB, Police Supervisor Second 
Class Xie Yiqi [6220 0122 1142]. The young men who participated 
in apprehending this drug dealer were the Assistant Head of the 
Drug Enforcement Squad Nong Jingyao [6593 6855 1031] and 10 
other excellent detectives from the Drug Enforcement Squad. 
  The street ambush in the end accomplished this: The 
confiscation of 12 parcels of concentrated "Double Lion Global 
Brand" heroin, 3,900 grams total. 
  Calculated on the retail price in the United States black 
market at the beginning of this decade, 3,900 grams of heroin 
could be sold for $8 million. Even if it were sold in Hong 
Kong, it could still bring in tremendous profits of more than $3 
million. 
  But the police did not seem particularly happy about getting 
this large quantity of drugs. This was because the battle had 
only started. 
  2. Victory is followed by hot pursuit 
  The drug dealer was taken into the interrogation room. 
  There were only chairs and a table in the room, and the 
walls 
were painted a snowy white. The only thing catching the eye were 
eight words posted on a wall: "Leniency to those who confess 
their crimes and severity to those who refuse". 
  The old, veteran detective Huang Feng [7806 2800], already 
greying at the temples, has piercing eyes even when he isn't 
mad. Now, he opened the black briefcase and lay the drugs on the 
table, staring at the drug dealer's eyes without saying one word. 
  The young detective Li Kai [2621 0418] kept to the side, 
awaiting his time to pressure the criminal. 
  The atmosphere in the room was very tense. 
  Minute by minute, the time passed by. 
  Gradually, the drug dealer's will fell apart, he could hold 
out no longer, so he yelled, "I want to confess! I'm guilty! I 
beg the government give me a break, give me a chance to do 
something worthwhile to make up for my crimes..." 
  The drug dealer (called "A" from here on for 
short) confessed that he was 32 years old this year, of the Han 
nationality, with a junior middle school education. He was the 
son of a worker in a suburban Nanning work unit. In 1983, he was 
sentenced to three years for larceny, and was released in 1986 
after serving his sentence. He then went to Ruili, Yunnan, where 
he married a local woman, and lived with her in housing of a 
work unit in a north Nanning suburb. 
  Huang Feng interrogated him directly, "How many drugs have 
you sold in Nanning in all?" 
  A was flustered, but still wanted to cover up: 
"Just the 12 parcels, no more than that, no more..." 
  Huang Feng snorted. "No more than that? Would you like me to 
bring you a witness to confirm that? You had better be a little 
more clear-minded. We caught you out of a city of a million 
people; that's not something we did casually." 
  A knew quite well that the business he was 
involved in was dangerous, so he was always very careful. He 
couldn't understand why he still couldn't shake the drug 
enforcement police off his trail, even though he had changed his 
expression and movements several tens of times over the past 
month. What had gone wrong? However, he did understand that 
since the PSB already knew so much about his activities, if he 
didn't tell the truth, he would suffer the consequences of 
"severity to those who refuse." 
  In the end, A started to confess. 
  After A had been released when his sentence 
expired, he moved to Ruili, Yunnan, and made his living by 
cheating, defrauding, and swindling. He very soon met a drug 
dealer named Yang Anquan [2799 1344 0356]. In July, 1993, 
A and Yang Anquan shipped 8,500 g of heroin from 
Ruili to Nanning and sold it there. In addition to the 12 
parcels of 3,900 grams of heroin which had been seized, others 
had been sold, and 270,000 yuan in illicit money had been 
brought to Yunnan three days before. Before his departure, Yuan 
told A that he had another 20 parcels of heroin which 
he would market in Nanning later. 
  From many years experience in public security work, Huang 
Feng was certain that A had not told him everything, 
so he kept on pressing him. "Tell me, who bought drugs from you 
in Nanning? Don't expect to sneak away!" 
  This made A collapse. 
  "Well, I...I thought of..." A had to confess more 
about his crimes. 
  On the same night, five officers, including detectives Zeng 
Xuyan [2582 2485 1750] and He Daguang [0149 1129 0342], drove 
directly to the suburb of Yanzhiling, where they knocked at a 
resident's house. 
  Just as they were going in, Zheng Xuyan shouted loudly: 
"Brother He! Brother Yun! How about we do some business!" 
  The drug dealers Pan Hefei [3382 7729 7378] and his brother 
Pan Yunfei [3382 0061 7378] were playing cards under the light. 
Hearing the shout, they raised their heads. The men before them 
now had never come there before, so they were puzzled: "We don't 
know any of you brothers, and we don't know what kind of 
business you want us do?" 
  Zheng Xuyan was still all smiles: "We're sure this business 
will be done. But I know you'll definitely be the loser in it!" 
He then yelled: "Go!" Acting in pairs, the four other policemen 
grabbed each of the drug dealing Pan brothers. They were easily 
handcuffed, then escorted to the police car. 
  After nabbing the Nanning drug dealers, the tracking squad 
then began a long distance, direct trip to Yunnan. On 10 
September at 1300, two police cars quietly left Nanning. Riding 
in them were the Assistant Head Nong Jingyao, and the rest of 
his outstanding detectives: Zhen Xuyan, Li Jiansheng [2621 1696 
3932], Liao Bin [1675 2430], Tan Ping [6223 1627], He Daguang, 
Li Kai, Tan Yiqing [6223 0110 0282], Gu Wenyong [7357 2429 
0516], and Li Shihong [2621 0013 1347]. 
  They arrived in Yunnan in the midst of the rainy season. The 
road zigzagged through the tropical rainy forest, and for one 10 
km stretch the roadbed had caved in, greatly delaying their 
driving time. To catch all the criminals in the case, the 
tracking squad continued their trip by day and night, despite 
fatigue and bad weather. When they arrived in the city of Ruili 
on 15 September, it was already dusk. 
  3. By intelligence and courage 
  On the morning of 16 September, Detectives Tan and Li, in 
the 
guise of big businessmen, and along with the drug dealer 
A, checked into a very luxurious hotel in Ruili. The 
next afternoon, according to plan, they went with A 
to meet Yang Anquan at his home. 
  Although Yang Anquan was only 27 years old, his long time in 
the underworld had made him very wary. He looked at the two 
businessmen suspiciously, and immediately rejected them: "I 
don't have any of that stuff, you'd better look somewhere else!" 
  Afraid of losing his chance to atone for his crimes through 
performing meritorious services, A hurried to say, 
"Didn't you say you have 20 more parcels of the stuff? How can 
you deny it when I've brought these businessmen such a long way? 
Do you want to make us go back empty-handed?" 
  Yang Anquan flatly denied it. "Did I say that? Maybe you 
heard me wrong!" 
  Tan knew how to handle people like Yang Anquan: give them 
more latitude at first, to keep a tighter rein on them 
afterwards. Therefore, he said, "Since Mr. Yang doesn't want to 
do any business, why should we bother him? Let's go!" The three 
of them confidently started to leave. 
  But just as the three of them were getting into their car, 
Yang called after them: "Wait a minute! Where do you live?" 
Detective Li smiled to himself; the fish was taking the bait. He 
pretended not to show interest: "In the xx Hotel, room xx. But 
since you don't have the stuff, why bother!" 
  Yang Anquan tried to make up to them: "I'm sorry, I was 
boasting last time. Actually, the goods are there, but somebody 
else has them, and besides, the goods are in Myanmar. If you two 
want to do some business, I can introduce you." 
  It was found out later that the reasons Yang Anquan refused 
right at that moment were, one, he was being cautious, and two, 
he wanted to get rid of A and keep all the profits 
for himself. But then when he saw how close A was to 
the "businessmen," he realized that was impossible, so he had to 
change his mind, and decided to share the profits with 
A. 
  On 18 September, Yang Anquan twice went to see the 
detectives, negotiating with them as the representative of the 
owner. Tan and Li used high performing skills in bargaining with 
him. 
  Yang Anquan said, "The owner wants you to pay a 60,000 yuan 
advance deposit." 
  Tan replied, "Nonsense!" We haven't seen the goods yet, or 
him, so why should we give you 60,000 yuan up front? If you take 
off with the money, where do we look for you?" 
  Li chimed in on Tan's side. "What? Are you dreaming, don't 
you know the rules? The money is handed over while checking the 
goods! It's always been done that way!" 
  A, who was ambitious to earn merit points, also 
frequently interrupted to blame Yang Anquan. 
  Seeing that the other side was so sophisticated, Yang Anquan 
believed they were real buyers. Expecting to make a great deal 
of money soon, his enthusiasm for this deal grew. At last, they 
reached an agreement to pay only a 30,000 yuan deposit, which 
Yang would pay for them, expecting to be repaid later. He would 
bring the owner of the drugs across the border the next day to 
contact them. 
  B [the drug owner] was a large man, tough-looking 
and menacing. Many years of rough experience in the underworld 
had made him a typical desperado. But he was not suspicious this 
time, since he had safely done business with Yang Anquan on 
numerous prior occasions. So, as soon as he entered the room, he 
asked: "Did you two businessmen bring enough money?" 
  "Name a price," said Tan. 
  B lifted his middle finger. "200,000 yuan!" 
  With a cold smile, Tan said, "We didn't bring that much. We 
initially agreed in Nanning that we would get the goods, so why 
should we have to bring so much money here?" 
  B insisted that the goods would not be shipped 
from Myanmar unless he saw the money first. At the same time, 
our side insisted on not paying before seeing the goods. The 
"negotiations" broke up in discord. 
  Nong Jingguang immediately reported the situation to the 
Nanning PSB, and his superiors there instructed him to accept 
the conditions. 
  The following day, the detectives returned to the 
"negotiations", and told B that they agreed to his 
demand to "see the money before shipping the goods", but our 
side still insisted on "paying for the goods on receipt." 
  Although the "negotiations" had succeeded, it was not easy 
to 
raise 200,000 yuan in cash in so little time. The drug 
enforcement squads of the Yunnan Dehong Dai Nationality Jinpo 
Autonomous Prefecture and the Ruili PSB gave them their full 
support, and helped their police comrades from Guangxi raise the 
200,000 yuan in a very short time. 
  On 24 September, a mysterious person unobtrusively entered a 
hotel in Ruili, carrying two heavy suitcases. 
  On the afternoon of 25 September, when these two suitcases 
filled with cash were opened in front of Yang Anquan and 
B, these two money-loving people suddenly emitted 
spittle three feet in length--drooling with envy, they agreed 
with great pleasure to ship the goods as soon as they had 
returned to Myanmar. 
  So, after 10 full days and 12 contacts, negotiations, and 
repeated arguments, Yang Anquan and B would send the 
real goods. At that time, it was only six days before the Moon 
Festival and National Day, a time when every family gets 
together to enjoy the moon and their affection for each other. 
This meant that the tracking squad would be far from Nanning and 
missing their families. 
  On the night of the Moon Festival, when the beautiful bright 
moon had just risen, someone knocked at the rooms where the 
detectives were staying. The visitor gave them a package of food 
and said, significantly, "`Dad' let me bring you some moon 
cakes. `Dad' says that everything is O.K. at home, and he just 
wants you to concentrate on the `business' and come back home." 
  Every detective in the tracking group understood that this 
was a gesture of caring on the part of their organization. It 
gave them such a warm feeling, eating the authentic Lianrong 
moon cakes from their hometown, and there was sweetness in their 
hearts. 
  4. All-out attack 
  The days had passed, but B had still not returned 
from his secret trip back to Myanmar. Waiting on the Chinese 
border, Yang Anquan had grown anxious and worried. 
  Had something gone wrong? 
  Yang Anquan couldn't stand waiting any more, so he went to 
Myanmar. 
  Nong Jingyao and his tracking squad held an emergency 
discussion: We still have the money, the drug dealers won't 
sneak away without getting the money. Because the money is their 
only objective, they will definitely come back for it. 
  Finally, after another eight days had passed, Yang Anquan 
and 
B met again as arranged. They solemnly announced that 
the goods were all set, and would be shipped. What had happened 
was that during this time, Yang Anquan and B had been 
looking for cotton and rattan in Myanmar; the plan was to hide 
the goods inside cotton or rattan for shipment through China's 
border customs. 
  On the morning of 18 October, B hid the drugs 
inside the cotton, and drove to the customs on the China border. 
When he learned that cotton was subject to a strict, 5-day 
quarantine examination, he became frightened and quietly went 
back. 
  It was really a problem. The tracking group reported it to 
the Dehong Prefecture PSB and the Ruili PSB. In the meantime, 
they kept on observing, waiting for their chance. 
  On 22 October at 0900, Yang Anquan and B suddenly 
appeared and asked that Tan go with B to inspect the 
goods. Yang Anquan stayed behind with Li and A. 
  Things had suddenly taken a very dangerous turn: Tan would 
have to go to the drug dealing site; what would happen? Li would 
stay behind, but what if A, the drug dealers' 
one-time associate, was hot to deal with them, and pulled a 
double-cross? Even more important, they hadn't received the 
drugs yet, did not even know where they were. If the drug 
dealers escaped, they would be far short of success for lack of 
a final effort. 
  If we don't take action now, what are we waiting for? Nong 
Jingyao made up his mind at once, and immediately divided the 
tracking squad into two groups, one going by car and 
motorcycles, following Tan's route and reacting as events 
unfolded. The other group stayed behind, responsible for 
arresting the remaining drug dealers. 
  Detective Zhen Xuyan burst into the hotel room, and gave an 
eye signal to Li. Acting simultaneously, the two grabbed Yang 
Anquan, who had no time to react, and wrestled him to the floor. 
Detectives Li Jiansheng and Liao Bing rushed in, rapidly 
handcuffed Yang Anquan and A, and escorted them to 
another room for close surveillance. 
  Meanwhile, B had led Tan to a freight yard. There 
was nothing in the yard, no trucks at all. 
  The goods had disappeared! 
  Leaving Tan there, B left hurriedly on a 
motorcycle. Nong Jingyao, who had been following them, saw that 
Tan was all right, and waved to indicate that he would continue 
to observe the situation. 
  Certain that B would return to the hotel 
regardless of whether he found the goods, Tan took a taxi back 
to the hotel. 
  After searching everywhere for his missing rented truck, 
B decided that our detectives were not underworld 
figures, but outsiders who had stolen the drugs. Furious, he 
returned to the hotel to find the "businessmen" and settle 
accounts. 
  Entering the room, and finding both A and Yang 
Anquan had disappeared, he realized something was wrong and 
tried to escape. Tan and Li jumped into his way, and at first 
tried to place him under arrest. But B resisted so 
fiercely that they were unable to restrain him at once. The 
sharp-witted Li Kai joined in the struggle, and taking out his 
pistol beat B roughly about the head. The three 
detectives used their fists, elbows, and feet, and finally 
subdued the crazy B after more than 10 minutes' of 
fierce fighting. B completely lost his ability to 
resist, and collapsed to the floor. 
  Both Yang Anquan and B had been apprehended, but 
where were the drugs? 
  "Search!" 
  The emergency order went out immediately on the radio waves. 
Police from the Ruili PSB and other Yunnan police agencies, who 
had been standing by for some time, were divided into more than 
10 searching parties. Like lightning, they ran out to every 
parking lot and freight yard. 
  Meanwhile, three other squads went separately to arrest 
other 
criminals--Yang Anquan's wife, Xiao Rong [2556 2837], was 
arrested at her home while playing majhong with a neighbor. Li 
and two other police officers broke down the door, brandishing 
an arrest warrant. 
  The driver Zhang Xinping [1728 2450 1627], who had been 
responsible for transporting the drugs, had just returned from a 
truck parking lot. He hadn't even time to smoke a cigarette 
before two police officers suddenly appeared, shouting, "Don't 
move! Come with us." So he was caught. 
  The female drug dealer Meng Shuai [1322 1596] was drinking 
with her husband in their family's restaurant, when Gu Wenyong 
[7357 2429 0516] and three other police officers suddenly 
appeared as if from the air, catching her as well. 
  After a complete and thorough search of each parking lot and 
freight yard, they still had not found the car carrying the 
drugs. 
  Nong Jingyao was deeply concerned about the situation. 
Suddenly, he realized what the problem was, and asked Yang 
Anquan, "You were there when the drugs were loaded. Tell me! 
What kind of car was it? What was the number of the car?" 
  Yang Anquan answered, "It was an 8-ton truck, Yellow River 
make, with the number..." 
  Nong Jingyao's thinking was that the hired driver was 
unaware 
of what had happened. The original agreement was to ship the 
cotton to Nanning, where payment would be made; was it possible 
that the driver had been too impatient to wait for B 
to bring people to check the goods, and he left?" Inspired, he 
at once gave the order: "Follow him to Kunming!" 
  The detectives jumped into the already moving police car and 
sped off. 
  The road was full of zigzags and slopes, and cave-ins were 
encountered frequently, but Tan Yiqing was a highly skilled 
driver and continued to increase his speed, 60 km, 80 km.... 
  More than an hour later, they finally caught up with the 
Yellow River truck. Tan Yiqing made a beautiful sharp right 
turn, then slammed on his brakes, bringing the Yellow River 
truck to a halt. 
  When the car had come to a complete stop, the detectives 
jumped out and took up positions which blocked the truck's 
retreat. 
  They carefully searched through 120 individual parcels of 
cotton. Not until they got to the bottom did they find it: 58 
parcels of concentrated heroin, with a gross weight of 20,560 g. 
  So now, the number one drug enforcement case in Guangxi was 
a 
complete success, with a total of 24,460 g (24.26 kg) of heroin 
confiscated, and with the apprehension of eight drug dealers 
both from within China and from outside its borders. 
  At 1500 on 12 November, as the three police cars carrying 
the 
drug dealers drove into the Nanning PSB, several hundred family 
members, coworkers, and ordinary people welcomed them with 
applauuse and cheers. 
  Nong Jingyao ordered, "Line up! Salute!" 
  Ten detectives dressed in camouflage at once lined up, and 
saluted their family members, the national flag, and the people. 
That image of 10 muscular bodies shining in the afternoon 
sunshine is deeply etched in people's minds.

  [Editorial Report] Seoul SISA JOURNAL reported in its 10 
February issue on pages 20-30 that its own special team of 
reporters had recently made a trip to Southeast Asia's Golden 
Triangle to search for clues of Korean involvement in Khun Sa's 
heroin trade. 
  While visiting the Golden Triangle, the SISA team learned 
that a Korean man has been working for Khun Sa and that Khun 
Sa's international narcotics organization has selected Korea and 
Japan as its "next heroin markets" because heroin supply routes 
to the United States have become increasingly dangerous, while 
Korea and Japan are easily accessible by sea. Korean smugglers 
already use the open seas as smuggling routes to transport gems, 
aged teak roots, tiger skin, bear's gall bladers, etc. from 
Southeast Asia. 
  The Korean Government reportedly has no means of stemming 
the flow of heroin into the country. The SISA team is urging 
the government to shift its attention from philopon (crystal 
methamphetamine) to Khun Sa's heroin.

<F P=106> [Article by Subin Khuaenkaeo in Shan State, Burma] </F>
  [Text] Drug warlord Khun Sa says he will allow the proposed 
Upper Salween Dam project, which will divert water to Thailand, 
to be implemented only if the Shan State in northern Burma is 
granted independence. 
  "Many big rivers in this area flow into the sea and that's 
not very useful. It would be better if we could make use of 
these rivers," Khun Sa, who is also the leader of Muang Tai Army 
(MTA), said. 
  But the Upper Salween-Mae Taeng project is, in his opinion, 
a 
matter between the Shan (Tai Yai) and Thai peoples who are 
"brothers". "It's not difficult for us brothers to reach an 
agreement," he said. 
  He insisted that it has nothing to do with the Burmese 
military junta. 
  The area designated for the dam site is located in the Shan 
State opposite Wiang Haeng in Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai. 
It is widely speculated the project is to be financed by 
Japanese investors through Thai businessmen. 
  It is true the Salween River passes many towns belonging to 
Burma, he said, but the proposed dam site is in the Shan State 
which he claims is free from Burmese influence. 
  "At present, Burma fails to extend its influence over this 
area. If the Thai Government gives money to Burma for the dam, 
it's definite SLORC (the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, Burma's ruling junta) will use the money to purchase 
more weapons to kill all Tai Yai people. I don't want that to 
happen." 
  Khun Sa spoke to the BANGKOK POST at an MTA military parade 
of newly-trained soldiers at one of his camps not far from the 
headquarters. The 4,564 young soldiers, described by the drug 
warlord as excellent fighters, will be posted at strategic areas 
along the banks of the Salween River. 
  He said some Thai businessmen had visited him to convince 
him 
of the dam project, but to no avail. 
  "I told them this is a big deal. The project will take some 
time and need many workers. I am also worried about the impact 
on natural resources, like the forest and wildlife." 
  But Khun Sa said he was ready to talk to the Japanese 
investors rather than the brokers. 
  He said he sympathised with the Thai people affected by 
drought. 
  "I wish the Thai people had a chance to use the river too. 
But they should understand that I will never allow the dam to 
materialise as long as Burma is involved and gets money to buy 
weapons. I think the Thai people will be sympathetic to us as 
well." 
  Chao Gunched, the president of the Shan State People's 
Representatives Assembly, said he also was not opposed to 
diverting water from the Salween River to Thailand. 
  "But the project will be more beneficial if the dam site is 
shifted from Sob Pad in the Shan State to Tha Sala which is 
higher. It will make it easier to channel the water to Thailand. 
I'm quite certain the Shan people will not oppose the project 
should they have direct contact with us (the Shan State 
assembly)," Chao Gunched said. 
  News about the proposed dam was released early this year 
which happened to coincide with the mobilisation of over 10,000 
Burmese soldiers into the eastern part of the Salween River, 
confronting the MTA in the west. 
  In the north, more than 5,000 Burmese soldiers are heading 
towards Muang Ton and Muang Kaen in Shan State which is not very 
far from the designated dam site in Tha Sala. It is believed 
the Burmese army targeted Muang Sanklang because of its 
strategic advantages. 
  Khun Sa said his stronghold had been surrounded by the 
Burmese army for about four months. 
  "The Burmese army reached us and stepped back because they 
dared not pull the trigger. We fired at them four or five times 
and claimed no less than 100 lives. 
  "The Burmese then sent some 200 United Wa State Army 
fighters 
to attack us but they also moved back because we are in a better 
position. 
  "The Burmese soldiers came on December 1 last year and I 
have 
kept an eye on them ever since. I think they realise that they 
will be defeated if fighting breaks out. They will lose face. 
Therefore they dare not attack us," claimed Khun Sa. 
  The drug warlord said the MTA would fight to the end. 
  "I always tell my soldiers that our camps are our lives and 
we have nowhere to escape. If we can keep the bases, we can 
keep our lives. Either the Burmese die or us." 
  The Tai Yai, the name used for Shan people of Burma, have 
fought the Burmese army for 48 years, he said. 
  "When we had rice and money the Burmese took them away. We 
just have our lives left and Burma still wants to take us and 
use us as draught animals to carry military supplies for them. 
That's why we have to fight. I have never negotiated with the 
Burmese." 
  Khun Sa said he was not certain that negotiations would ever 
be possible. 
  "I don't think there will ever be talks. Maybe they don't 
know where I will be seated. I am a drug warlord and I am 
entitled to a higher position," he said with a laugh. 
  The MTA leader said he disagreed with the plan to invite 
Burma to attend the ASEAN meeting in Thailand as a guest country. 
  "In fact, the association should invite me. Burma has no 
compassion as the SLORC kills its citizens every day. Even the 
US realises this." he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jason Gagliardi] </F>
  [Text] A lengthy spell in the briny was not enough to wash 
away the mark of the world's most notorious opium lord from the 
biggest heroin haul seized by Hong Kong police in two years. 
The "Double Uoglobe Brand" label stamped on 96 blocks of 
high-grade heroin, weighing 67 kilograms and worth more than 
$50m, is the trademark of Khun Sa, the shadowy king of the 
Golden Triangle. Narcotics Bureau police used grappling hooks to 
drag the drugs from the seabed south of Lamma Island on Friday, 
after a tip-off led to a search of the area. 
  "This was a very big seizure so it was not surprising that 
it 
was Khun Sa's stuff," a police source said yesterday. "He is 
the number one man in the Golden Triangle and authorities have 
been after him for years. Khun Sa is believed to have a number 
of hideouts and factories on the Burmese side of the Thai 
border. He flits in and out of the Golden Triangle but no one 
seems able to catch him." 
  Khun Sa, which means "Prosperous Prince" in Burma's Shan 
dialect, ships his heroin through Thailand and is known to use a 
road built by the Thais to the remote border town of Homong, 
where he is believed to have a base complete with international 
telephone dialling, satellite television and soldiers armed with 
the latest in weapons. 
  Hong Kong police are still on the trail of the syndicate 
which dumped the drugs at sea -- a ploy used to minimise the 
risk of the entire shipment being seized on reaching the 
territory -- and have predicted a "long-term" investigation. 
The heroin is believed to have drifted along the sea floor and 
out of reach of the traffickers. The wrapping had begun to 
deteriorate, although the drugs were not damaged. 
  In another operation on Sunday night, police seized 13 
kilograms of high-grade heroin, worth about $8m, in Ngau Tau 
Kok. Acting on information from the Narcotics Bureau, officers 
of the Kowloon East regional special duties squad staged a raid 
on a flat in Amoy Garden and arrested two men after finding the 
heroin and packaging equipment. The men were still being 
questioned last night.

  [Text] Hong Kong, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong [HK] 
police seized 13 kilograms of suspected No. 4 heroin with a 
retail value of eight million HK dollars (1.02 million U.S. 
dollars) in Kowloon late last night. 
  The seizure was followed by the arrest of two men, both 
26-year-old, at a flat in a block in Kowloon after two weeks' 
investigation. 
  Later, police seized some packaging equipment inside the 
flat, believing the premises was used as a drug packaging and 
distribution center, which supplied drugs to Kowloon West region.

  [Text] Those evil drugs are like an octopus entangling 
several Indonesian cities. As reported by TEMPO's Heddy Lugito, 
in Semarang, for example, the snack center in the Simpang Lima 
Plaza Complex has become a place for young people to get high. 
When an emaciated man showed up on Friday afternoon last week, 
young people surrounded him. 
  The man then distributed pills which looked like buttons. 
Gulp! They shoved the buttons down into their throats. In a 
short time they were grinning like idiots. 
  The skinny young man goes as far as Denpasar and Jakarta to 
get his goods. "They've got good stuff there," he said. That 
includes Ecstasy. Unfortunately, since the Ria case, that evil 
drug has disappeared. But the customers are making every effort 
to order it. "They're stubborn; they keep ordering that great 
stuff. Ten people have ordered it, but the stuff isn't around," 
he said. 
  In Semarang alone drugs can be gotten around campuses, in 
discotheques, in pubs and in hotels. The skinny, near-sighted 
man is a middleman who has dealers in various locations in 
Semarang. Just hand over 20,000 rupiahs and an hour later the 
dealer will bring you a package of Marlboros containing 
cigarettes laced with marijuana, also known as suket, plus six 
5-gram Somnil pills. 
  Children of Semarang bigshots and businessmen are looking 
for 
Ecstasy. The middle class and the lower class look for 
inexpensive pills, such as Mogadon, Arthan, also known as double 
"L" (for lele, the word used in young people's slang), Somnil 
and Nepam, which cost around 15,000 rupiahs for 10 pills. School 
kids, college students and even government employees like those 
hallucinogenic pills. They also like BK pills, which are cheaper. 
  Those illegal drugs sell like hotcakes. "Every week I can 
sell around 1.5-million-rupiahs worth," said a dealer in 
Semarang. The SDSB [a kind of lottery] has been discontinued but 
the drug business is skyrocketing. The drugs come from Surabaya, 
Bandung, Jakarta and Yogya. But the dealers don't know who the 
boss of the suppliers is. It's hard to track the links in the 
illegal drug ring, they say. 
  Solo is also involved. Especially the stands around the 
campus. "Do you have any benik," asks the buyer when he looking 
for drugs. Some tradesmen in Solo's Klewer Market have also been 
infiltrated by the narcotics ring. "We keep chasing after them 
to break the links in the narcotics ring," Colonel H. Suseno, 
Chief of the Surakarta Regional Police, told TEMPO's Kastoyo 
Ramelan. 
  Last month, for example, the syndicate planned a meeting. 
They wanted to straighten up the distribution network in 
Tawangmangu, Solo. There was also supposed to be a sex party in 
the villa. The police infiltrated it. But they got wind of the 
police activity (they call the police tawon) and the raid failed. 
  It's the same in Yogya and in Medan. Do you want ngurtak? 
That's the word in Medan for illegal drugs. The price of a 
Riportil pill, which addicts usually call by the code word R two 
dots, is 1,500 to 2,000 rupiahs a pill. Rohypnol, also known as 
R one dot, sells for 2,500 to 3,000 rupiahs a pill. Addicts say 
that if you take too much Riportil, it makes you drool without 
your being aware of it. That's why this drug is also called the 
mad-dog pill. 
  Illegal drugs create the opportunity for making counterfeit 
drugs. A student who graduated from the ITB [Bandung Technical 
School] School of Pharmacy, for example, took advantage of this 
opportunity. He produced counterfeit pills imprinted with the 
names BK and Mogadon. "The counterfeit pills got you high very 
fast because the dosage had been increased on purpose so that 
the consumer would be happy," said a TEMPO source. The 
counterfeit pills usually have simple packaging and the pills 
are dull in color. 
  Besides that, at the end of November a counterfeit-drug 
factory was discovered by accident in Bandung. A house in the 
Cikutra subdistrict burned down. It turned out that the house 
had been producing illegal drugs for nine months. Four 
perpetrators were arrested--Rudi, Husen Sebastian, Maman and 
Tata. The police also seized three kilograms of Mogadon, 37 
kilograms of Voltaren, six kilograms of Rohypnol, 5.5 kilograms 
of Nipam and other prescription drugs. 
  The four gang members confessed that the drugs were marketed 
in Jakarta, Cirebon and Central Java. A short time later the 
police arrested the middlemen in Bekasi, South Jakarta, Mataram, 
East Java and in the South-Central Kalimantan Police District. 
  It's been said that competitors burned down the secret 
factory on purpose. But the police denied this. "The house 
burned down because the oven used to prepare the drugs exploded. 
We found illegal drugs and counterfeit drugs there," said 
Colonel Waliran, chief of the Bandung Metropolitan Police 
District. 
  In Bandung these drug transactions take place in a cafe 
which 
is well-known as a gathering place for local artists. It's easy 
to tell who is an addict and who isn't. "Just look at their 
glass of beer. If it doesn't get finished but it isn't refilled, 
that means he's using drugs," said Deddy Stanzah, the champion 
of druggies, 43 years old, who has now woken up to what he was 
doing. 
  According to that rocker, Bali is a hotbed of the narcotics 
trade. It's no surprise that the Island of the Gods has had 105 
cases, involving 145 individuals, over the last five years. 
There were 106 Indonesian citizens and 39 aliens -- seven 
Italians, four Australians; the rest were from America, Nepal, 
Switzerland, Japan, etc. In 1992 there were 12 cases and the 
following year it jumped up to three times that number. 
  In the final quarter of last year in Bali, Bhisnu Bahadur 
Karki, a 21-year-old driver and citizen of Nepal, was arrested 
carrying 4.88 kilograms of heroin which originated in Bangkok. 
Then there was Abul Kalam, a 37-year-old common laborer from 
Bangladesh, who was carrying 3.3 kilograms of heroin. 
  Even hotter was the case of a 33-year-old Brazilian tourist 
Frank de Castro Dias. In the middle of January he brought a 
surfboard into Denpasar. When he passed through the X-ray 
inspection at Ngurah Rai Airport, officials were suspicious 
because a dark spot on the back side of the surfboard showed up 
on their monitors. 
  But Dias kept calm. "In fact, he helped cut the surfboard 
open," F. X. Djoko Budiono, chief of the anti-smuggling section 
of the Ngurah Rai customs service regional office, told TEMPO's 
Putu Fajar Archana. Dias had flown from Rio de Janeiro to South 
Africa and then stopped off in Singapore. When he stopped in 
Bali, well, he was thrown into a jail cell. 
  Ngurah Rai Airport is now equipped with 13 X-ray detection 
machines. "With that equipment, at least we have an indication 
that there is something suspicious," said Djoko. But frankly 
speaking they have never netted any Ecstasy pills at the 
airport. Besides depending on X-rays, officials also have other 
ways of suspecting tourists from certain countries considered 
police "customers". 
  During the investigation, the syndicate's chain always 
breaks 
somewhere in the middle. They always claim they don't know who 
they are supposed to contact when they arrive in Bali. In short, 
they claim they're not dealers, just couriers. "Dealers don't 
transport the illegal drugs themselves," said Djoko. He feels 
that the five kilograms seized up to now could not be marketed 
in Bali. "It's a matter of buying power," he added. 
  On the other hand, narcotics have never been flown out of 
Bali. Heroin seized in Bali always comes from the mainland of 
Asia (Hong Kong, Bangkok, Myanmar, Taipei and Laos). Cocaine 
comes from South America and marijuana from South Asia 
(Pakistan, India and Afghanistan). If the opium sap is harvested 
in August to October, it is certain that Customs in Bali will 
harvest arrested drug tourists from November to January. 
  Heroin and pills are smuggled into Bali in the traditional 
way. For example, they are put into cans, surfboards or in the 
lining of bags. Nobody, for example, goes so far as to swallow 
them; as soon as they pass through airport inspection all they 
have to do is wait in the bathroom. 
  Actually, some people believe that the narcotics ring also 
supplies Bali and other areas through the port of Benoa as well 
as through the airport. Many foreign cruise ships tie up there. 
This is a possible opportunity. "I have seen tourists come 
ashore without passing through any inspection," said a tour 
guide. 
  Drug distribution is no less frenzied in Jakarta than it is 
in Bali. The areas of Pasar Senen, Blok A, Glodok, Jatinegara 
and Bendungan Hilir are well-known if you know your way around. 
Illegal-drug transactions, they say, take place in several 
discotheques, for example discotheques in the Blok M area, South 
Jakarta, or in the Central Jakarta area. 
  In Blok M, for example, a discotheque hostess freely 
answered 
a guest who asked for "buttons". "What kind do you want? Rohib 
or Nipam? BK pills are outdated. They're no longer in style," 
she said. In Jakarta BK pills, which are packaged in simple 
plastic, are only 1,000 rupiahs for seven pills. "They're for 
pedicab drivers or kids who work in the market," said a college 
student. Rohypnol is now the popular drug in their circles. 
  But if you're looking for morphine or heroin the market is 
closed up. The singer Fariz R. M. and the rocker Gito Rollies, 
who used to be heavy intravenous drug users, claimed they didn't 
know how to find those drugs because they're outdated. Both of 
them claimed that they had repented in recent years. "I don't 
know a thing about the drug ring. And if I knew, maybe I 
wouldn't tell you about it," said Gito, 45 years old. 
  Deddy Stanzah, who was once mixed up in a narcotics ring, is 
convinced that narcotics are brought into Indonesia by officials 
who serve abroad, as well as by the Mafia and by professional 
dealers. The reason? The business is very profitable. "Take a 
look. Security is very tight but drugs are available," he said. 
  So far drug dealing here is still a puzzle for the police. 
Are Bali and Jakarta transit points or are they markets? Nothing 
is clear. But just look at the figures. At the end of August, 
for example, Kara Alexander Webber, a citizen of New Zealand, 
was arrested in Brisbane, Australia. As she was about to fly to 
Denpasar it was discovered that this girl was carrying 140 grams 
of heroin wrapped in condoms inserted into her anus and vagina. 
  Then, in the middle of September, Bishnu Kumar Bisha, a 
citizen of Nepal flying to Jakarta, was arrested in Bangkok. He 
was carrying 11.7 kilograms of heroin. A week later Obassa 
Napoleon Lobiniji, a citizen of Kenya, was arrested in Singapore 
as he was about to leave for Jakarta carrying 10.2 kilograms of 
heroin inserted into a television tube. 
  Other facts: on September 25 Yong Peng Ang, a citizen of 
Singapore, was arrested in Sydney (he had arrived from Jakarta 
on Garuda) because he was carrying 79 condoms containing 462 
grams of heroin wrapped around his body. The following day, Seow 
Toon Han and Jack Beng Chin, both citizens of Singapore, were 
also arrested in Sydney (they had also arrived from Jakarta) 
because they were carrying almost 800 grams of heroin in condoms 
also wrapped around their bodies. 
  Is inspection lax at Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Cengkareng? Not 
so. On 8 September a citizen of Myanmar carrying 6.9 kilograms 
of heroin was arrested at Cengkareng. Four days later, Prem 
Kumar Ray, a citizen of Nepal, was arrested with 11.45 kilograms 
of heroin. Then at the end of September officials at the airport 
arrested a citizen of Myanmar because he was discovered carrying 
nine kilograms of heroin. 
  The problem is that neither the Jakarta nor the Denpasar 
police have been able to get to the bottom of the ring. No 
answer has been found to the question of who is behind them. The 
suspects claim they are only couriers. They're given a 
round-trip ticket and paid thousands of dollars if the goods 
arrive at their destination safely. 
  It seems that there are other reasons for the inability of 
the authorities to break up the ring. The suspects are arrested 
at the airport by officials of the Customs Service. As soon as 
they arrest them, they report the matter to the police. In those 
few minutes their accomplices disappear. 
  But is it true that Jakarta and Bali are only transit 
points? 
A source at Police Headquarters confirmed this. Heroin is still 
too expensive for consumers here. The price is $500-700 for 
three grams. Besides that, heroin is taken intravenously, and we 
don't like that very much. Cocaine, for example, is different. 
The price is lower, around $150 per gram, and it's taken by 
inhaling. 
  The police keep on hunting for illegal drugs. The problem is 
that as soon as they are eradicated they turn up again. There 
are a lot of "factories" making counterfeit drugs, you know. The 
upper class thinks that Mogadon, BK, Dumolid, Somnil or Rohypnol 
are outdated. They're not trendy any more. And then the idle 
jetset brings some new stuff back from abroad: Ecstasy. It's 
expensive, it's hard to get, and its quality is fantastic. 
  It looks like this evil pill killed Aldi and in the end this 
brushed up against film star Ria Irawan. The police have yet 
another job--finding out how Ecstasy is distributed.

<F P=106> [Report by El U. Macaspac] </F>
  [Text] The Central Police District Command (CPDC) has 
created a drug enforcement team which will conduct police 
operations in a national level. 
  CPDC Director Chief Superintendent Diony Alvaro Ventura 
bared 
this during their weekly command conference wherein he directed 
his 11 station commanders to turn over all cases involving 
illegal drugs to newly-activated Drug Enforcement Task Force 
(DETF). 
  According to Ventura, the DETF will be the sole authority in 
the command level to conduct intelligence and investigation on 
suspected drug traffickers not only in Quezon City but also 
nationwide. 
  "Not only that, but DETF will also be responsible in filing 
drug cases which was the normal practice in CPDC before. DETF 
was born by a unified effort not only to sting the street but 
the national level as well," Ventura explained. 
  He said, only two commands -- the CPDC and the Western 
Police 
District Command (WPDC) -- under Senior Supt. Hermogenes Ebdane 
were tasked by Chief Superintendent Recaredo Sarmiento III, 
National Capital Region Command (NCRC) director, to create their 
own "centralized" drug enforcement office. 
  He said the two command's task forces will be headed by 
Supt. 
Dominador Resos. 
  The PNP-Narcom [Philippine National Police-Narcotics 
Command] 
has provided the personnel, the PNP General Headquarters will 
render legal assistance, and the PNP Crime Laboratory will 
conduct lab testing on seized illegal drugs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Burmese Days"] </F>
  [Text] The export of revolution is taboo under the existing 
world system of nation-states. The obvious implication is that 
the non-existence of democracy in a country cannot justify 
others' refusal to maintain normal relations with it. The 
tendency to be oblivious of this logic has affected bilateral 
dealings with Myanmar [Burma] ruled by a military junta. Many in 
India as well as other democratic countries have understandably 
been outraged by the repression unleashed by the dictatorial 
regime in Yangon [Rangoon]. It has earned worldwide hatred 
particularly because of the five-year-long house arrest of the 
popular leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. It is, of course, open to any 
country or group of countries to subject the country to a degree 
of isolation as a means of forcing its military rulers to mend 
their ways. In the case of most other errant regimes, this has 
worked but not so in regard to Myanmar. The reason simply is 
that Myanmar has preferred splendid isolation right from the 
dawn of its independence. There is no evidence that the more 
conspicuous measures of boycott enforced in recent years have 
changed the insularity of the Myanmarese to any great extent. In 
fact, such penalties seem to have begun attracting the law of 
diminishing returns. 
  Apparently, this realisation was behind the recent visit of 
the US Congressman, Bill Richardson to Aung San Sun Kyi. Whether 
it will facilitate a political dialogue between her and her 
tormentors is anyone's guess. 
  But it would be wrong to assume that Washington's interest 
in 
dialogue with Myanmar's rulers is limited to political reform in 
that country. The US, for instance, has given a high priority to 
checking drug traffic originating in Myanmar. But it can do 
practically nothing in this regard without the closest possible 
cooperation of the ruling military junta. The latter knows this 
very well. It follows that it will set a price for such 
co-operation. And nothing can be a better bargain from Myanmar's 
point of view than the removal of various restrictions on trade 
and loans from international institutions. 
  Inevitably, there has of late been a shift in India's stance 
towards Yangon, too. It is no longer one of blind hostility to 
the military junta. New Delhi has no alternative but to deal 
with the authorities across the border on a regular basis to 
keep the northeastern insurgents at bay. The danger of 
increasing diversion of Myanmar's heroin through India has made 
it even more urgent for the two countries to coordinate their 
anti-drug traffic operations. A memorandum of understanding for 
this and related purposes was signed by officials of both 
countries last month. This identity of interests cannot be 
relegated to the background merely because New Delhi does not 
like the internal arrangement within Myanmar. Diplomacy is all 
about how to achieve shared aims despite divergences of other 
kinds.

terrorist funds became effective from today. It will usher in a 
new era of cooperation between the two countries and reflect the 
political will to deal firmly with terrorists and those involved 
in drug trafficking. 
  This was told to PTI by the British home secretary, Mr. 
Michael Howard, at a dinner hosted by the Indian high 
commissioner, Mr. L.N. Singhvi, in honor of the visiting prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in London last night. The 
agreement provides for confiscation of funds in any of the two 
countries of those involved in the pursuit of terrorist 
activities as also drug trafficking. The agreement for the 
purpose, together with the India-British extradition treaty, had 
been signed in London in 1992.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Amman Jordan Television Network in 
Arabic at 1830 GMT on 17 March 1994 carries an 18-minute 
"special program" entitled "Drugs". 
  As the program begins, the announcer says a problem, 
regarded 
as one of the most complicated problems in the 20th century, is 
sweeping the world, particularly youths: drug addiction. The 
announcer adds: "An analytical reading of statistics on drug 
cases in Jordan reveals that the drug problem will grow 
continuously." She notes that what makes the drug phenomenon a 
growing challenge in Jordan is the fact that Jordan lies between 
areas that produce drugs and those that consume them. Jordanian 
territory is used illegally by drug smugglers as a passage for 
drugs, she adds. 
  The program presents interviews with several unidentified 
individuals, including an unnamed official who says: "No doubt, 
we have a drug problem. As long as we confiscate various forms 
and kinds of drugs, arrest people involved in drug cases, and 
refer drug cases to the courts, we have a problem. With much 
regret, this problem grows from one year to another. This is 
proven by the fact that in 1992 we confiscated 3,000 kg of 
hashish, whereas in 1993 we confiscated 4,000 kg of hashish. In 
1992, we referred to the court 163 drug cases in which 396 
people were involved, whereas in 1993 we referred to the court 
212 cases in which 513 people were involved." 
  Later, the announcer adds: "With regard to the geographic 
distribution of drug cases in 1993, it was as follows: Amman, 
59 cases; al-Zarqa', 35 cases; al-'Aqabah, 35 cases; the desert 
area, 16 cases; Irbid, 17 cases; al-Mafraq, 16 cases; Ma'an, 11 
cases; al- Salt, one case; al-Ramtha, five cases; Ma'daba, one 
case; al-Azraq, five cases; the central Jordan Valley, one case; 
the al-'Umari border post, one case; the Suwaqah rehabilitation 
center [prison], four cases; the al-Juwaydah rehabilitation 
center [prison], two cases; the al-Karamah border post, two 
cases; al-Ruwayshid, one case; al-Karak one case; and 
Kurayyimah, one case." 
  The announcer notes that "international reports indicate 
that 
there are 7,000 addiction cases in Jordan, most of them are 
addiction to medicines disbursed by medical prescription and 
which are available in pharmacies. A few of these are drug 
addiction cases." 
  After explaining that the campaign against drugs cannot be 
carried out only by the drug fighting department because the 
drug problem has many other aspects, such as health, medical 
treatment, educational, information, and rehabilitation, the 
unnamed official adds that Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan has asked 
all concerned ministers and officials to coordinate and 
cooperate among themselves to work out the necessary plans, in a 
step similar to the formation of a higher national committee to 
fight drugs. 
  The program then discusses the impact of drug addiction on 
people's bodies, emotions, psychology, and productivity, as well 
as on the community's productivity and development programs and 
on the family's economic and social situation. 
  The announcer also interviews an unidentified clergyman who 
stresses that drugs adversely affect the human mind and 
perceptions, and that Islam prohibits drugs. The announcer 
points out that in the second half of 1984, the drug fighting 
department, assisted by other competent organizations, 
confiscated more than five million narcotic pills smuggled from 
Jordan's northern borders en route to neighboring Arab 
countries. Moreover, more than 10 kg of heroin were confiscated 
while being smuggled across Jordan en route to Arab and European 
countries and the United States. This department, the announcer 
adds, bans the illegal planting of drugs in Jordan and prevents 
the importation of poppy, opium, and cannabis seeds, unless they 
are toasted. 
  Interviewed by the announcer, Jordanian Health Minister Dr. 
'Abd al-Rahim Malhas says his ministry plans to build a special 
center in Jordan designed to treat drug addiction cases.

<F P=106> [Interview with Judicial Police Commander Brigadier General </F>
Salim Salim by Claudette Sarkis; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] Sarkis: A large quantity of hashish 
was seized recently. Then there were some other security 
incidents, preoccupying the Government and the security 
services. Will these incidents affect the security measures 
that were decided on at a series of meetings, and will they also 
affect the counternarcotics campaign? 
  Salim: There is a difficult drug problem all over 
the world. However, we in Lebanon have decided to confront it, 
no matter the cost. Some states are better equipped than we but 
they still have a drug problem, whether in regard to the 
quantities of the drugs or the numbers of addicts and users. 
These states include the United States, France, Switzerland, 
and Germany. 
  Despite our modest resources, in 1993 we in Lebanon seized 
large quantities equal to half the amount seized in the whole of 
Europe. Last year we seized about 22 tons of hashish. This is 
three and a half times the 6 tons that was seized in the 
previous four years -- 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. These 
figures show that a great effort was made last year, in which we 
also seized 292 kg of cocaine, compared with 37 kg seized in the 
previous four years. We also arrested 1,400 drug merchants and 
traffickers. 
  Sarkis: Does this mean that the counternarcotics 
campaign is continuing? 
  Salim: Naturally. Especially in the Southern 
Suburb [of Beirut]. Let us be frank and realistic. This is not 
the first time we have entered this area. We have entered it 
before and arrested wanted persons. Ordinary citizens do not 
know this because of the lack of media coverage. We work far 
from the limelight. The suburb is part of Lebanon and we reject 
any special status for it. Last time an incident occurred in 
which two judicial police were injured by a hand grenade tossed 
from a distance in a place crowded with people. However, the 
incident did not prevent the policemen from continuing their 
searches, seizing a quantity of hashish, and arresting four 
dangerous wanted persons. 
  We cannot prevent a citizen from tossing a hand grenade 
while 
we are carrying out our duty, whether in the suburb or elsewhere. 
  Sarkis: Why? What do you mean? 
  Salim: Because we work in silence. We do not 
speak. We cannot broadcast that so and so deals in narcotics 
and we will arrest him. The media here would cause harm and not 
benefit. 
  Sarkis: Naturally you do not announce such news. 
However, announcements have been made on the seizure and 
destruction of narcotics. 
  Salim: Yes, last year we carried out five 
operations to destroy narcotics seized in Lebanon. The 
destruction of the narcotics took place in the presence of 
liaison officers who had come from Cyprus at our request. 
  Sarkis: Why this presence? 
  Salim: Cyprus is a liaison center for officers 
from Europe and the United States. We asked them to come so 
they could see for themselves the seized quantities. Rumors 
circulated in the past that cocaine had been seized but that 
what was being destroyed was milk powder or white cement or 
something else resembling cocaine. We insisted that they come 
and inspect the material destined for destruction. This 
actually occurred. We put a small quantity of these drugs in a 
plastic bag containing a liquid. When the drug is mixed with 
this liquid, it shows what kind of narcotics it is. There are 
three colors marked on the bag. Violet means heroin, black 
means morphine, and blue means codeine extracted from opium. 
  Last time, I told them when we arrived at the destruction 
site that I had the testing bag with me. They answered that 
they too had a testing bag. They were embarrassed to use it in 
front of us after we insisted that they do so. On departing 
Lebanon, they said they were expecting that only half of their 
questions would be answered. They, however, left Lebanon fully 
confident that we are completely doing our duty. 
  Yesterday, I received a telephone call from a U.S. officer 
in 
Cyprus. He congratulated us on the seizure of the hashish haul 
in the Southern Suburb. Let us be frank, in the past the Suburb 
sheltered outlaws and no one could enter it. We entered it. We 
did not meet any resistance from the patriotic organizations, 
who care about their reputation because we all agree that drugs 
are an epidemic we must fight. Those who are confronting our 
personnel are not [Hizballah] Party or [Amal] Movement elements, 
but criminals. 
  Sarkis: What is the role of the Syrian Arab Forces 
and the other Lebanese forces in fighting narcotics? 
  Salim: The Syrian brothers have greatly helped us 
in combating narcotics. They still do so. The most important 
help was their destruction of narcotics in al-Biqa' Valley, 
where an estimated 200,000 dunams [one dunam equals 1,000 square 
meters] planted annually with poppies, yielding a crop of 800 
tons of hashish and 700 kgs of heroin. 
  Thanks to cooperation with them and with the Lebanese Army, 
the State Security Department, and the Public Security 
Department, we got results. We are all one team fighting this 
epidemic, because everyone suffers from it. It is a very 
dangerous disease that is worrying the whole world. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sarkis: Several drug-trafficking operations have 
been foiled. Does this mean there are still drugs around, even 
if in smaller quantities than before? 
  Salim: I know this question is still being asked. 
I have already said that a large hashish crop was produced 
annually in al-Biqa'. For two years now, the area has been 
clear of opium and hashish plantations. Last year they tried to 
cultivate 8.5 percent of the area they formerly cultivated but 
they were caught and the crop was destroyed. However, part of 
the hashish crop of two years ago is still around and has not 
been marketed. 
  Sarkis: How much of the original crop? 
  Salim: About six or seven percent, I think. 
Stored hashish decays with time. It is not long-lived and the 
oily narcotic substance in it evaporates, diluting the drug. We 
proved this by conducting laboratory analyses on some 
confiscated specimens. Over some period of time we found that 
the narcotic was diluted by a ratio of 11 to 4. 
  Sarkis: Will a day come when the stored hashish 
will run out completely? 
  Salim: It will end. We have received information 
that they are burying the hashish underground or hiding it 
inside wall cavities. This means that the drug is not as 
plentiful as before and I expect this reserve to be used up in 
one year. I wish to point out that hashish was first cultivated 
in Lebanon in 1976. The opium poppy was first planted here 19 
years ago. Two years ago Lebanon became practically clean as a 
result of a decision by the highest authorities to combat the 
narcotics trade. As a judicial police force, we made efforts to 
achieve this objective on the instructions of our superiors. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sarkis: Are there any statistics on the number of 
addicts in Lebanon? Have decreased since the counternarcotics 
campaign? 
  Salim: We must distinguish between an addict and 
an occasional user. The latter uses drugs only occasionally; 
this is a pre-addiction phase. I believe a user eventually 
turns into an addict. On this point I differ with the 
psychiatrists who say that whether a user becomes an addict 
depends on his receptivity. In Lebanon there are occasional 
users and also addicts. No definite number is known. There are 
many occasional users. According to statistics, in some 
villages 70 in every 1,000 citizens are occasional users. If we 
consider the quantity of drugs that enters Lebanon and is then 
reexported, we will realize that the number of addicts is not 
very large. In my personal estimation there are 50,000 
occasional users and addicts in the country. This is a 
relatively small percentage of the population compared with 
other countries. [passage omitted] 
  Sarkis: Does anyone active in the narcotics trade 
enjoy protection? 
  Salim: The instructions of His Excellency the 
President and other officials are to combat narcotics. No 
Lebanese drug trafficker has protection, no matter who he is. 
Anyone involved in the drug trade will be penalized. These are 
the orders of the highest authorities. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Islamabad -- The Police Service Group has 
expressed displeasure over the government's decision to put the 
drug operation under Army command and has also expressed doubts 
about the latter's success. 
  There is a wave of resentment across the Police officials 
who 
feel not only a threat to their basic functions but also that 
they will lose many of their cadre posts. This has already 
started creating bad blood and the police sources openly 
question the army's ability to deal with an issue as complex as 
narcotics. 
  The government had taken a decision in principle a few 
months 
back that the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board (PNCB) and 
Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) would be merged into one `elite 
force.' The new organisation would be given under the army's 
command and a Major General would head it. A few days back the 
government ordered the implementation of that idea according to 
which the PNCB would be merged with the ANTF and a new 
department, probably with a new name would be established 
through a notification. 
  The new force will be led by ANTF's Director General Major 
General Salahuddin Tirmizi. The PNCB's Chairman Dyas Mohasin 
was to be transferred and posted as Additional Secretary, 
Interior Division. The ANTF has been given six months to sort 
out the complete modalities of the merger. That would deal with 
the issue of how to adjust about 700 odd personnel of the PNCB. 
The new force would mostly comprise officers from the armed 
forces but would also have civilians who have had years of 
experience in the fight against drugs. 
  The decision to let the army take over the operation has not 
gone well with the police service. They feel that their basic 
functions are now being encroached upon. From the look of it, 
it appears that the army and police are in for a tense 
relationship as soon as the new force gets underway. 
  As one senior police official said: "The government has not 
done any service to the cause against drugs by minimizing the 
role of the police and giving everything under the army's 
control which may not be able to perform any better. The police 
officials will obviously obey the orders but one thing is sure 
that there would be problems as their response would be lukewarm 
and that of disdain." 
  The reasons for this resentment are many. The Police feel 
that the functions has been taken away from it when it had 
started performing exceptionally well during the past few years. 
One police source said that although the drug problem is not 
eliminated, but it was not just due to the department's fault. 
[sentence as published] It was the indifferent attitude of 
governments during the last 15 years, which despite knowing that 
this problem is growing into a social cancer, never allocated 
enough funds and extended the appropriate legal support to catch 
the culprits. 
  "The police was the only force which remained on top year in 
and year out in terms of drug seizures of all kinds. The spread 
of the menace was because successive governments lacked the 
political will to deal with the problem and that there were 
never enough resources to counter those who run a parallel black 
economy," said a top police source. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Winding Up the Narcotics Control Board"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued orders to 
dismantle the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board [PNCB] with 
immediate effect and to make it a part of the National Narcotics 
Control Agency in the wake of the board's failure to check 
narcotics smuggling. The chairman of the PNCB has been removed 
from his current post and appointed as an officer on special 
duty, while Major Salahuddin Ghazi, the director general of the 
Antinarcotics Task Force, has been temporarily appointed as 
chairman of the PNCB [sentence as published]. 
  In view of the large funds provided to the PNCB and wide 
powers given to it, one would have rightly expected that the 
board would play a very important role in checking smuggling and 
the growth of the narcotics menace. The PNCB has not only 
miserably failed in achieving the targets and objectives, but 
some of its officials have also been found to be involved in the 
narcotics trade. Several domestic and foreign agencies have 
vehemently criticized its performance. Under these 
circumstances, even the general public was questioning the 
justification for the continued existence of the PNCB in view of 
its miserable performance despite such a formidable amount of 
money invested in it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken 
an important step by disbanding the PNCB, which was an 
inevitable step in the interest of the nation and the country. 
However, the new task force set up to control narcotics 
smuggling needs to be made so effective that its solid 
performance in eliminating drug smuggling should by itself 
become visible to the public. A close watch should also be kept 
on the officials of the task force, so that they remain free of 
all the shortcomings, weaknesses, and corruptions that led to 
the dissolution of the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board.

<F P=106> [Article by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, March 18 (AFP) -- The United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) has tightened shipping rules in its waters as 
part of a crackdown on growing drug trafficking and illegal 
immigrants, a UAE minister said. 
  The rules include restrictions on the movement of boats and 
other cargo ships inside the territorial waters and at the Gulf 
country's ports, inspection of vessels and limiting the periods 
of stay at port, Interior Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Badi, told 
Friday's edition of UAE weekly AL-SHURUQ. 
  "These instructions have been conveyed to the Foreign 
Ministry which will circulate them through diplomatic channels 
to embassies of other countries," he said. "The new rules will 
be strictly observed." 
  Al-Badi, former chief of the UAE armed forces, said 
inadequate surveillance on shipping and ports in the UAE was 
posing a security threat as most of the drug smuggling and 
illegal immigration take place by sea. 
  He gave no figures on such activities but police records 
show 
more than 25,000 people from Iran, Pakistan, India and other 
Asian countries have been arrested in the past two decades as 
they tried to enter the UAE illegally. 
  Most of them came for jobs in the oil-rich country, tempted 
by its lax penalties, proximity to their homelands and lack of 
security along the coastline. This has prompted the UAE to 
install more radars and step up coast guard patrols but the 
problem has persisted. 
  The problem has also spurred calls for harsher punishment 
against illegal entrants and shipowners who transport them. The 
police records showed that the bulk of those immigrants arrived 
by small boats, concealed under cargo. 
  "These people are only aggravating the country's security, 
economic and social problems," a police official told AFP. 
"Many of them can not find jobs and this prompts them to 
indulge in crime. All those people are exacerbating the 
unemployment problem since thousands succeed in sneaking in." 
  UAE authorities refuse to admit unemployment but according 
to 
government sources, more than 300,000 people are either jobless 
or work illegally. The figure accounts for more than 40 percent 
of the 700,000-strong workforce. 
  Inadequate surveillance of the 700-kilometre (437-mile) 
shore 
has also given rise to drug smuggling, reportedly originating 
mostly from Iran and Pakistan. As a result, the UAE has become 
the most vulnerable Gulf country to international narcotic 
gangs, who are also tempted by its lax laws. 
  In 1992, around four tonnes of heroin, cocaine, hashish and 
other kinds of drugs were seized in the UAE, accounting for half 
the quantity busted in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC). The biggest drug haul in the region involved three tonnes 
of hashish seized with 13 Pakistani smugglers in the UAE port of 
Khawr Fakkan in 1991. 
  According to the new shipping rules, cargo vessels will not 
be allowed to enter UAE territorial waters unless they produce 
registration certificates, shipping permits, manifestos and 
names of crew and passengers, al-Badi said. 
  Powerboats are not allowed to stay at port more than 72 
hours 
while dhows, the traditional Arabian wooden boats, can not stay 
more than 21 days. They also must not move to another port 
unless they have a shipment there. 
  "Crewmen will not be allowed in if they do not have naval 
cards issued by their communication ministry," al-Badi said. 
  "We have also formed a committee which is now considering 
setting up special centres at ports to receive users of our 
ports to upgrade efficiency and boost security measures."

  [Text] Passersby found the body of a Lebanese national, 
Naef Kreicht, wrapped in a sheet in the lagoon on 13 March. He 
was a textile trader and about 50 years old. He had sustained 
knife wounds. This is what an AFP release has indicated pending 
any further official police statements. We were told on 15 
March that "investigations have only just begun." 
  The victim was kidnapped on 6 March by individuals who 
claimed to be members of the Nigerian religious brotherhood, 
"Manatari Save Yourself." The group had up until then been 
unknown in Cote d'Ivoire. It is reportedly based in Kaduna, 700 
km northeast of Lagos. 
  The kidnapping was reportedly a case of settling of scores 
among drug traffickers. Five Lebanese nationals, the victim not 
included, who are reportedly "top brass" living in our country, 
reportedly failed to refund the 333-million-CFA-franc profit on 
cocaine sales in 1992. 
  There is great anxiety within the Lebanese community pending 
Criminal Investigations Department findings.

  [Text] Transkei leader General Bantu Holomisa said he is 
waiting for a report from the Goldstone Commission on the supply 
of weapons to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and alleged drug 
trafficking by high-ranking South African security officers. 
The report, which was to have been tabled with the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council], has apparently been withheld 
by the commission pending further investigations. [Begin 
recoding] 
  Correspondent Ami Nanackchand: The disclosures 
were made at a Natal University forum in Durban where General 
Holomisa said information implicating six generals of the 
security establishment had been supplied to the commission 
towards the end of last year. The classified information was 
obtained from General Holomisa's tested intelligence and 
sources. He said that Judge Goldstone had briefed President 
F.W. de Klerk at the end of February of the commission's 
findings confirming the allegations. Mr. de Klerk allegedly 
refused to release the information. General Holomisa said he 
was told on Tuesday [15 March] that Judge Goldstone would 
release the report to the TEC within 48 hours. However, the 
next day the judge apparently said he was making further 
inquiries. 
  Holomisa: According to the latest information, or 
intelligence information, a classified one, he has briefed 
President de Klerk towards end of February and they have 
confirmed to him that indeed, your number two in one of your 
security forces and other generals are involved in drug 
trafficking as well as supplying weapons to Natal, to the IFP. 
  Nanackchand: General Holomisa also denied claims 
by the National Party that he was hindering free political 
activity in the Transkei. [end recording]

  [Text] Tirana, March 17 (ATA) -- "Heroin and hashish can 
be found in Tirana now," some youngsters who didn't want to be 
identified told an ATA reporter. 
  According to them, a gram of heroin costs 1,000 leks and 
after buying they divide it into four parts enough to fill two 
cigarettes. 
  The youngsters said it is not difficult to notice signs of 
these drugs even in the public places. 
  Pethidine was introduced in Albania no more than two years 
ago as an indispensable medicament in the emergency wards of 
clinics and hospitals but now there are shortages of it. Time 
before it was given in pharmacies free of charge while now it 
costs 500 leks and the price may increase again. Doctors at the 
central clinic in Tirana said that there are cases when 
youngsters have threatened them in order to get pethidine. 
According to some youths, pethidine is a weak drug for them to 
be used.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Mar (MTI) -- On March 11, Hungarian 
police seized 15 kgs of amphetamine ready to be compressed into 
tablets, and another 30 kgs of uncleansed material at a secret 
laboratory set up in the cellar of a country house in Biatorbagy 
near Budapest. (Amphetamine is a chemically produced synthetic 
material). This has been the greatest catch in Hungarian drug 
history, the Budapest daily NEPSZAVA reported today. 
  The search followed a warning from the Swedish police of 
good-quality amphetamine being distributed near Malmo, 
presumably transported to Scandinavia from or via Hungary. 
  The drug quantity produced and distributed in Europe is 
still 
unknown. 
  A Swedish-resident Hungarian man and a Greek citizen, who 
rented the house in Biatorbagy, were taken into custody.

<F P=106> [Markus Lesch report: "In The Throes of Crime"] </F>
  [Text] International crime is gaining increasing control 
over Germany's eastern neighbors. Organized crime is 
establishing itself in Poland and the Czech Republic along its 
path to Western markets, with Germany as the objective. The 
eastern laender can feel this already. 
  "In those countries, organized crime wants to earn its fare 
to come to Germany, so to speak, and is establishing permanent 
infrastructures there," said Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz 
Eggert at an international conference on internal security in 
Dresden. 
  "Western European crime is quickly spreading to the East," 
warned the president of the Czech Criminal Police Colonel Jan 
Vaculik. The most significant organized crime rings in the 
Czech Republic are groups of people from the Russophone area. 
"These groups are virtually impossible to overcome. They 
enforce silence with brutal methods, similar to those used by 
the Mafia in relation to the Omerta," Vaculik explained. 
  Contacts between this "Russo-Mafia" and Italian groups have 
been documented. Crime bosses from Naples and Moscow have 
already met in Prague in order to organize the smuggling of 
cocaine. The strongest Italian group is the notorious Camorra 
from Naples. Vaculik: "We have information that the Camorra 
wants to expand even further, to Russia and Estonia." 
  The third organized crime group consists of the Chinese 
"Flying Dragons and `K-14' from New York, who extort protection 
money and deal in transfers of human cargo from the Far East to 
Germany and Western Europe. 
  Warnings signals are also coming from Poland, especially 
regarding drugs. "Poland has become a laboratory for synthetic 
drugs," says Janusz Wolny of the Polish Interior Ministry. "In 
addition, there are increasing quantities of cocaine from South 
America, heroin from the Near, Middle, and Far East, and 
marijuana from Africa." The quantity of drugs seized in 1993 
was double the 1992 figure. 
  The brutality of the criminal elements is growing at an 
alarming rate. In 1993, in fights alone, there were 185 heavy 
offenses, including 56 homicides, 31 kidnappings, and 38 attacks 
with firearms or grenades. 
  Even in Dresden, a hand grenade blew up in front of a police 
precinct. "The violence is going to get even bigger because of 
the involvement of criminal groups from CIS and the Czech 
Republic on the prostitution scene," warns Peter Raisch, 
president of the Saxon Criminal Office. 
  The Mafia lawyer Teresa Principato from Palermo confirmed 
the 
growing interest of Italian crime groups in East Europe and the 
German market. "Eastern Germany is a favorite place for money 
laundering," she said. "The police forces of the different 
laender appreciate the importance of international cooperation 
to fight crime. Now is the time for politics to follow suit," 
said Italy's best-known Mafia expert.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dealers and Smugglers Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] On the weekend about 1.5 kg of heroin from Turkey 
with a black-market value of at least 1.5 million schillings was 
discovered in a highway pull-in in Ansfelden near Linz. After 
weeks of investigations, criminal police officials took action 
during the planned handing over of the drugs and arrested five 
dealers. The arrested persons are two men from Wels aged 26 and 
29 respectively, one Slovene (38), one Macedonian (28), and a 
30-year-old woman from the vicinity of Wels. The Slovene and 
the Macedonian had bought the drugs in the FRY. 
  On 8 March Manfred E. and Alfredo J., both from Vienna, 
arrived at Vienna's western railroad station shortly after 1100, 
having come on the "Danube Waltz" train from Amsterdam. In 
their luggage they carried 2.5 kg of hashish and 700 grams of 
marijuana at a total market value of about 300,000 schillings. 
The two men were arrested by a reception committee of the 
Vienna criminal police and taken to the prison in Vienna's 
Provincial Court, the police announced. 
  E., 39, from Vienna's eighth district and photographer J., 
32, from Vienna's fifth district, who works for a weekly, went 
to the Dutch city on 5 March, where they rented a room in the 
"Citadel" hotel. According to information released by the 
police, an Arab, who has not yet been identified, supplied them 
with the drugs there. Then the two returned to the Austrian 
capital in the couchette car of the "Danube Waltz" train on 7 
March. The two smugglers hid the drugs in the train's toilet.

<F P=106> [Report by Christian Roesner: "Dealers Owning Millions </F>
Arrested"] 
  [Excerpts] The turnover that a drug gang achieved with 
1,400-1,800 kg of hashish in "Theo's Corner" in Vienna-Fuenfhaus 
is said to have amounted to 140-180 million schillings; 
twenty-four offenders, among them four principals, are under 
arrest. This was reported by Joachim Pirker from the Security 
Office in the capital on Friday [11 March]. 
  The hashish was smuggled in amounts of 10-30 kg under the 
back seats of cars from Amsterdam to Austria. [passage omitted] 
  During the arrest on Monday [7 March], savings bank books 
with deposits of 800,000 schillings, 300,000 schillings in cash, 
10 kg of hashish, and some weapons were seized. [passage

<F P=106> [RITZAUS Bureau report: "Man Arrested With 100 Kilograms of </F>
Hashish"] 
  [Excerpts] A 36-year-old man was found out at the 
Danish-German border when he tried to smuggle around lOO kg of 
hashish from Germany into Denmark. This is the largest hashish 
seizure that police and customs officials have made in recent 
years. 
  The 36-year-old, who is an Icelandic citizen, is being held 
for preliminary investigation in Grasten. The criminal police in 
Aabenraa have charge of the investigation. [passage omitted] 
Icelandic police revealed that the man has lived in Spain for a 
number of years, and that earlier he had been convicted for drug 
smuggling in both Iceland and Great Britain. 
  The finding of the 100 kg of hashish in the man's baggage is 
the biggest single seizure at the Danish-German border in recent 
years. For all of 1993 only around 30 kg were seized at the 
border. The two preceding years, customs and police officials 
found about 400 kg of hashish. 
  Reduced customs inspection at the border following Denmark's 
joining the Internal Market in 1993 was named by the chief of 
the Sonderborg Customs and Taxation Region as the reason for 
authorities more rarely uncovering attempts at narcotics 
smuggling.

  [Text] Kassel/Friedberg -- The police in Hesse reported 
two successes in the fight against drug-related crime today. In 
Kassel, criminal officers seized over 8 kg of heroin with a 
street value of between 10 and 20 million German marks and 
arrested three suspects. In Friedberg in Hesse and in Arhus in 
Denmark, a six-member drug ring was smashed that smuggled about 
one-half tonne of hashish to Denmark. 
  As the police announced in Kassel, the heroin was discovered 
after the arrest of a Belgian drug courier in a tire that had 
been thrown away. In the man's car, the police first found 1.1 
kg of drugs. It is believed that an accomplice of the Belgian 
wanted to take the tire, but threw it away while trying to 
escape. 
  The arrest of the German-Danish drug gang, which took place 
as early as on 9 March, was preceded by month-long 
investigations. Those detained included a 50-year-old Danish 
woman who traveled to her home country from Friedberg every two 
weeks since the middle of 1993, smuggling 25 kg of hashish 
during every trip, the police announced. The recipients were 
serious criminals in the rocker scene.

  [Text] Emmerich (DPA) -- After a check on the highway near 
Emmerich, customs officials on Friday discovered some 85 kg of 
hashish with a street value of 1 million German marks. This is 
the largest quantity of hashish seized in the German-Netherlands 
border region to date, the supreme fiscal authority of 
Duesseldorf stated. The border officials became suspicious 
because the driver did not heed a signal disc. The suspicion 
was confirmed by a tracker dog who began to wag his tail. In a 
skillfully welded hiding place beneath the boot, the dog smelled 
out the drugs. The two students from Berlin, aged 20 and 21, 
claimed not to know anything about the drugs--and were arrested.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- Last year, customs and Federal 
Border Police apprehended 27,300 smugglers, 3,700 more than in 
1992. However, only 12,670 smugglers were arrested - ,130 less 
than the year before. The number of smuggling incidents 
discovered rose by 4,000 to 131,000, as Joachim Gruenewald 
(Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in 
the FRG Finance Ministry, announced in Bonn on Monday. The 
value of the smuggled goods was 76 million German marks [DM], 
which is DM16 million less than the year before. Taxes levied 
on smuggled goods, however, rose from DM23 to DM32 million. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the field of drugs, the increase in the number of 
impounded LSD tablets is striking. In 1993, 22,582 tablets were 
seized, compared with 12,607 the year before. In addition, 
there were 10,705 kg of hashish (1992: 10,506 kg) and marijuana, 
849 kg (1,143 kg) of heroin, 931 kg (1,025 kg) of cocaine, and 
37 kg (36) of amphetamines. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Drug Scene: Shell Out USD1O Million </F>
Annually"] 
  [Text] Narcotics police say confiscations of illegal 
substances in 1993 lead them to estimate that the domestic 
market shifts some USD1O million annually. 
  Police and customs agents confiscated roughly 20 kilograms 
of 
hashish, a record 3.3 kilograms of amphetamines, and 200 grams 
of cocaine in 1993, with the above-cited monetary figure based 
on a 15 percent catch rate for illegal drug smugglers and 
current street prices for the poison. 
  "It's often been said that we ferret out and confiscate from 
10 to 15 percent of the substances that enter the country. 
Whether this is right I dare not comment on, but it is clear 
that we fail to stop all but a fraction of what comes to 
Iceland," daily DV [Reykjavik DAGVISIR] quoted narcotics officer 
Gudmundur Baldursson as saying. 
  Baldursson said the surprising drop in cocaine seizures--a 
mere 200 grams was snatched in 1993, compared to 1.3 kilograms 
the previous year--was likely attributable to the economic 
recession and the drug's high street price.

<F P=106> [Neil Darbyshire article: "Dutch Dealers Net 1bn Pounds in </F>
UK Drugs Market"] 
  [Text] Dutch drug traffickers are believed to have made 1 
billion Pounds from Britain in five years, the co-ordinator of 
the Regional Crime Squads said yesterday. 
  They were handling so much sterling daily that one gang 
leader employed four people full-time simply to count it, said 
Mr Neil Dickens, who recently returned from a trip to Holland. 
  Specialising in amphetamines, LSD, cannabis and cocaine, 
Dutch gangs act as wholesalers to British dealers. 
  "If drug distributors in the UK paid 1 billion pounds for 
their source of supply, one can begin to estimate the value of 
crime committed to finance the purchase of those drugs on the 
streets," he said. 
  Mr Dickens said the threat from foreign gangs expanding into 
markets in this country was one the police service, with its 
locally-directed constabulary system, was illequipped to meet. 
  He told chief constables at Bramshill police staff college 
in 
Hampshire a national detective force should be created. 
  "A national structure would provide experienced senior 
managers to ensure the international work is undertaken in an 
appropriate manner," he said. 
  Mr Dickens said the seven regional squads and the Scottish 
Crime Squad should be amalgamated into a National Crime Squad 
with central funding. 
  "Each region designs its own objectives, business plan, 
quality of service, or strategy, which in my view now needs to 
be more centrally directed to address the major criminal who 
knows no boundaries," he said. 
  "It is perhaps understandable that individual squads, whilst 
to a certain extent recognising themselves in a national 
structure, remain parochial and self-interested concerning their 
activities. 
  "Teams of officers are often travelling the length and 
breadth of the country to undertake surveillance when RCS 
(regional crime squad) colleagues from that target area could 
more costeffectively undertake the work." 
  A national structure would provided a single reference point 
for strategic planning the update of information technology, 
technical surveillance and training.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Ryabov: "Immediate, but Not Medical </F>
Attention: What Russian Drug Addicts Receive Instead of Medical 
Care"] 
  [Text] 
  The militia is arousing alarm publishing its reports about 
the number of drug addicts and crimes connected with drug 
dealing. Already it appears that the influx of harmful 
substances into Russia cannot be restrained. However, Russian 
laws are oriented toward making the same mistakes that have 
already been made in Western countries, harshly punishing drug 
users. The state shows little mercy for those who suffer from 
drug addiction. 
  ...Four years ago he sat on the dirty stones of the Arbat, 
burying his face between his knees. People emerged from the drug 
store, huddling themselves up from the piercing autumn wind, not 
even trying to help him to his feet. 
  He was in complete despair. The last of his money had been 
spent on "grass." His bills were already past due a month 
before, and his friends had turned their backs on him. The 
watchful pharmacy staff absolutely refused to issue him the drug 
he needed without a prescription. He was on the needle, a heroin 
addict. All he had left was to die. 
<H5>  Near "Natasha" </H5>
  ...The stereotype of drug dealers and users has been 
somewhat 
shaken. Usually the images of these type people are just the 
opposite, but... In a self-assured gait a young man in a long 
coat approached three importune teenagers in torn dirty jeans. 
  It was eight o'clock in the evening, a Sunday. They stood 
two 
meters from me in a stairway leading to an underground passage 
on Pushkin Square near the "Natasha" store. After a few seconds 
of negotiation, the most enlivened "grungy-looking" youth made 
up his mind: 
  -- I know him, in fact. Everything is O.K., we can take a 
walk, and he nudged his companions in the back. 
  They were not the only ones, however, who had turned into 
the 
archway near the theater ticket booth. A middle-aged man, who up 
until then had been standing unnoticed near a telephone booth, 
lit a cigarette and set out after the four. 
  Two of them walked ahead, apparently talking about some good 
high. They were soon overtaken by the buyer and dealer "on 
duty," who were slipping on the worn icy slope. I did not follow 
them down, but I could clearly see them standing at the bottom 
of the decline. The ritual of selling several match boxes of 
hash, as hashish is sometimes called, was not of interest. What 
interested me was this new character. I had heard about 
informants in plain clothes hired by the militia to trail people. 
  The dealers and their client went down to the end of the 
street and disappeared into an entry way. Near drug trafficking 
"points" there are always apartments where the drugs for sale 
are kept. The client, of course, does not go in, but waits for 
the goods nearby. In order not to let the buyer out of their 
sight, dealers do not work alone. 
  Most likely, the "spy" had grown tired after a long day's 
work. Having gone halfway, he turned around and went back to 
where he had come. Was his workday over? Having returned to his 
original position, he met up with two policemen on patrol, who 
had been distracted in the passageway, shooing away some old 
women peddling all sorts of junk. 
  -- I just got through calling. The chief let me off. Can I 
go 
home? Tomorrow I will be back at 10 a.m. sharp, he told the 
policemen. 
  Dreary from the cold, the civil servants gave their 
"colleague" a disdainful glance and let him go. He was not the 
only one of his kind at their service. While walking along the 
passage they stopped several times, first to have a little word 
with two big men with shaven heads, then with a heavily made-up 
prostitute. The young lady told the civil guardians about the 
movements of some "chick in a fur coat." Several minutes later, 
as though friends, they both sat on an iron box near the 
escalator and, while dangling their boots, shelled seeds... 
<H5>  A Racket in Uniform </H5>
  The militia is fighting against the social order. The police 
sergeant stops anyone that seems suspicious to him, of which 
there are many on Pushkin Square. Ilya lives close by. His outer 
appearance unfortunately arouses an inexplicable tension in 
policemen. It seems to them that the reason he frequently stands 
at the metro entrance is not that he lives close by, but 
something else. 
  -- Every other day they stop me. What am I guilty of, having 
a suspicious appearance? 
  During curfew hours, imposed not long after the events in 
October, the militia organizes round-ups at all the suspicious 
places where non-conformists gather. An entire detachment of 
OMON officers [Special Purpose Militia Detachment], arriving on 
a bus late in the evening searched the apartments where the 
followers of Petlyura live, the designer and charismatic leader 
of the youth underground. They found nothing. How did they know 
that drugs were there? It is incomprehensible. 
  The militia is doing its duty. Our legislation makes no 
distinction between those dealing drugs and those using them. 
Anyone found with drugs during a search can end up in jail. In 
any quantity. So the militia searches. The more people they stop 
the greater chance of guessing right... 
  Not all who are caught go to the police station, however. 
The 
Law frequently resorts to being an official racket; if there is 
no money, identification information is taken down and threats 
are made to "take them in" if no money appears. 
  Chances of finding the needed drug dealer or user on the 
street are great for the militia. According to infrequent polls, 
the number of occasional drug users in the CIS at the beginning 
of last year neared 8 million. A year before that there were 
approximately 1.5 million. These figures were arrived at after 
estimating the volume of drugs in circulation within the borders 
of the former USSR. 
<H5>  Life -- No High </H5>
  It is well known that the majority of narcotic substances 
come into Russia from Central Asia and Afghanistan. The 
Tajik-Afghanistan borders represent the same line of fire for 
Russian security services as the U.S.-Mexican border does for 
Americans. 
  However, aside from organic drugs in Russia, there are a 
large number of synthetic substances. When borders were still 
tight, amateur chemists filled the drug void with their 
inexpensive goods. Today their experience is not going to waste. 
  There are quite a lot of underground laboratories in St. 
Petersburg. They are closely tied to the market in Moscow. One 
of the most productive laboratories of LSD in the northern 
capital had to shut down, (according to rumors, "limos with six 
doors rolled up to the person in charge, and out slid enlivened 
youths who announced that instead of homemade acid, they were 
going to bring in real American acid, nicknamed "California 
Sunshine [Kaliforniyskoye solnyshko])," whereupon a deficit of 
this particular drug formed in Moscow. 
  At fashionable, although not altogether young parties, 
almost 
everyone has access to dealers of all types of drugs. LSD and 
"grass" are especially popular in this environment, however. 
Heroin, which is considered a crude drug, is used by the most 
unfortunate. Cocaine is the preferred drug of both the mafia, 
and people wishing to give the pretense of being part of the 
establishment, as well as those who just "get lucky." 
  The militia's fight against drug dealing in Russia boils 
down 
to catching any violator with drugs in his or her possession, in 
any amount. It matters not what kind. They are all considered 
criminals, even the drug addict, that is, a person who 
physically cannot live without doing drugs. The militia is least 
interested in the medical aspects of the problem. 
  A young man, free of prejudice and with a mind of his own, 
told me: 
  -- Drugs will always be around. They are a harmful 
temptation, which a certain segment of the population will never 
be able to give up. The fight against drugs is fruitless as long 
as there are these kinds of people. And they will be around, 
because life will never be like a drug high. 
  ...The crisis for the young man in front of the drug store 
fortunately passed. He recovered. He did not resort to crime. It 
was medical care that saved him, however, not the punitive sword 
of the law, with which he clashed during his fall into the abyss.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustem Kamal: "Strong Customs Control Can Impede </F>
Smuggling And Narcobusiness"] 
  [Text] A meeting was held between the Republic Customs 
Committee and the Chief Administration for the Struggle Against 
Smuggling and the Violation of Customs Regulations. The meeting 
was devoted to summing up work done last year and defining the 
duties standing before them. Shahin Jahangirov, head of the 
Chief Administration, in his analysis of work done in 1993, 
stated that last year serious shortcomings were allowed in this 
sector. He mentioned the names of workers who were lax in this 
job. The speaker also said that in the sector of the struggle 
against smuggling and customs violations the work of the customs 
houses in Bilesuvar, Sumgait, Khachmaz, Aghstafa, Imishli, 
Khudaferin, Balaken and Yevlakh were especially deficient. In 
some cases instances of smuggling and customs violations were 
not accepted by the court because they were incompetently 
prepared from the legal standpoint. Along with this, he noted 
that following just criticism leveled at customs workers by 
Heydar Eliyev, a serious turning point had been reached in the 
committee's work. 
  In the last two months alone, 23,700 US dollars, 6,300 
Iranian Riyals, 40 truckloads of iron pipe, 1,633 tons of metal, 
3,129 aluminum plates, 620 grams of mercury, and various types 
of night vision and other optical equipment in the process of 
being smuggled out of the country were seized and held by 
workers of the Chief Administration. 
  There was also serious conversation about a question which 
created excitement at the meeting. This was the search for 
effective ways to conduct the struggle against the 
narcobusiness, which is a world problem. Last year seven 
kilograms of narcotic substances were seized and confiscated by 
customs workers.. On the basis of investigations conducted and 
facts obtained they were able to come to the conclusion that 
those engaged in narcobusiness consider Azerbaijan to be a 
critical place, since it is the shortest route from the Orient 
to Europe and they want to use it as a transit point. From the 
speeches it became clear that the use of specially trained dogs 
from Russia has led to good progress in this sector. It was also 
stressed that the cooperation of all law enforcement agencies of 
the republic in the fight against narcobusiness is essential. 
  One of the speakers at the meeting, Huseyn Memmedov, a 
responsible worker at the Ministry of National Security, also 
emphasized the importance of such cooperation. Participants at 
the meeting considered Azerbaijan's membership in the 
International Association against Narcomania and the 
Narcobusiness to be a positive event.. It is considered 
important that cooperation with it in this sector continue in 
the future. 
  There was also discussion of the customs workers being 
subjected to the use of weapons in some places. Thus, issuing 
customs workers engaged in the struggle against smugglers 
weapons was noted as a demand of the day. 
  In addition, committee workers expressed their disturbance 
on 
the inappropriate interference by law enforcement organs 
exceeding their authority in regions where customs houses are 
operating. 
  Speakers noted that Azerbaijan as an independent state 
maintains free economic relations with the countries of the 
world, and a number of foreign states transport goods out of our 
republic. As a result of this, customs workers come across new 
illegal types of international trade. Some of these involve 
extremely expensive goods. These open up new possibilities for 
potential smugglers. There are also many who wish to smuggle 
valuable national and historically important art works and 
strategic goods abroad. Speakers noted the important of 
establishing customs intelligence in order to conduct an 
effective fight against those wishing to do our country material 
or spiritual harm. 
  In the course of the meeting one reached the conclusion that 
workers of the Customs Committee understand well how much damage 
can be done to our country by criminals smuggling valuable goods 
abroad. Now the basic question is the transition from the word 
to the deed in this difficult time for our country because the 
economic power of a country which has been drawn into war and 
part of which is occupied depends on the activity of its customs 
workers.

<F P=106> [Besik Urigashvili report: "Checks Confirmed: Shevardnadze </F>
Did Not Do Drugs"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The Georgian Health Ministry's drug 
service has carried out medical checks on members of the 
Georgian head of state's apparatus in order to flush out drug 
addicts there. Shevardnadze himself underwent a medical 
[examination] too. As might have been expected, no drug addicts 
were found in Shevardnadze's apparatus. 
  Ramaz Sakvarelidze, head of the Georgian leader's press 
service, made the following comment on this unusual event: Drug 
addiction has penetrated the state's structures of authority. 
This is one means of combating it. All officials in ministries 
and departments along with the personnel of the parliament and 
cabinet of ministers apparatuses will undergo similar checks. 
  The reason for the checks was the countless statements by 
Georgian parliamentarians to the effect that some members of the 
cabinet of ministers do drugs and are helping to form a drugs 
mafia in Georgia. At the same time the power ministries -- the 
Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs --were the 
primary targets along with staffers in the apparatus of certain 
vice premiers. 
  We will leave aside the effectiveness of these actions, 
since 
any sensible person is aware that these checks will have zero 
results in practice. The moral aspect is far more important. 
And it is hard to disagree with the opinion voiced by 
parliament Deputy Ivlian Khaindrav, who says that the enforced 
nature of these checks is offensive. As for the propaganda 
nature of the action, in the current situation it can only 
impress Joe Public. 
  However, the problem of drug addiction in Georgia has indeed 
become menacing. Figures provided by the Georgian Internal 
Affairs Ministry Narcotics Administration demonstrate that the 
republic is one of the main staging posts for the international 
drug business. In the last few years there has been a 
considerable increase in drug use in Georgia itself. The 
country is now one of the world leaders in the field.

<F P=106> [Article by Umar Ongov, city of Tashkent, under the rubric </F>
"The Narcotics Business": "Uzbekistan: A Narcotics Window to 
Europe?"] 
  [Text] The problem of drug addiction has no borders. It has 
gone beyond the confines of individual regions and can no longer 
be considered one of the social problems or forms of crime 
outside the general economic and political context. The 
narcotics business is actively invading the sphere of 
international politics and world economics as a dominant factor. 
That is the opinion of the International Narcotics Control 
Committee expressed in the report of the director of the 
regional representation of the UN program UNDCP, Arkadius 
Meydzhik. In a most direct way it affects Uzbekistan, which at 
this time is one of the major consumer states and transit zones 
through which narcotic substances are transferred from Asia to 
Europe. 
  Despite the fact that, according to official data, only 
4,400 
drug addicts and 3,700 people potentially willing to use a drug 
are registered in Uzbekistan. But the percentage of narcotic 
substance users is much greater than the state statistics. 
Incidentally, even governmental circles acknowledge this. 
  Unfortunately, UNDCP representatives do not have complete 
information. Thus, according to Mr. Meydzhik, a characteristic 
feature of some law enforcement organizations of Uzbekistan is 
the unjustified top secrecy of the information they have. As a 
result, UNDCP is forced to work with official statistics which, 
alas, too often pass off wishes as fact. 
  At the same time, however, according to a sociological 
survey 
by independent experts and from sources close to law enforcement 
services, 1 out of every 100 of the republic's residents may be 
classified as persons who have tried narcotics at least once. 
The percentage of those who regularly use these drugs is also 
high. Drug use is most widespread among public transport 
drivers, workers, college students, and vocational-technical 
school students. 
  Cannabis is one of the main types of narcotics found in 
Uzbekistan. Moreover, in some corners of the republic the use of 
opium, especially its derivative koknar, is quite widespread. 
Undoubtedly, the government of Uzbekistan is taking concrete 
steps to resolve the problem, in particular regularly conducting 
"Black Poppy" operations to destroy plantings of opium poppies 
and developing programs to preserve industrial fields of hemp. 
But the development and application of new criminal procedure 
laws as well as ones now in operation which do not yet satisfy 
the existing convention are needed. Contemporary information 
systems and many other things must be introduced. And most 
importantly, consolidation of all interested organizations is 
needed rather than secrecy.

<F P=106> [Report by "special correspondent" Humberto Saccomandi in </F>
Rome] 
  [Excerpt] Antonio Carlos Amorim, the Rio de Janeiro Court 
of Justice president, on 10 March recanted the charges he had 
made previously on illegal foreign financing for a Brazilian 
political party. He emphasized that he does not have any 
evidence but only a report from a "respectable" person. 
  Nevertheless, Amorim believes money actually is entering 
Brazil illegally and being used to finance politicians. 
Reportedly, the financing mainly comes from Italy, but also from 
France, Germany, and even Poland. He noted that he is not aware 
of the party that reportedly benefited from this financing. If I 
were aware, Amorim said, "I would not have to ask the Italian 
courts for help." On 8 March, Amorim hinted he actually was 
aware of the party involved. He said: "It is a party that might 
gain power in October." 
  The judge denied that he had stressed that the money came 
from Mafia criminal activities or from drug trafficking 
activities. In remarks to Brazilian journalists at the Vitorio 
Mele attorney general's hall in Rome, Amorim on 10 March said: 
"I never said that." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal 
Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of 
Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by 
Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking 
mafia operating in the Amazon River basin. 
  Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to 
those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of 
the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week. 
  Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its 
participation in the campaign that will be named "Operation 
Blockade" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also 
will support it. 
  The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent 
explained that the plan includes the establishment of an 
information network among the armed forces of the countries 
sharing the Amazon basin. 
  Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all 
the 
federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and 
multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200 
Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation. 
  Sposito also indicated that "Operation Blockade" has the 
basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian 
border with the other four countries. 
  Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of 
countries 
used as transit routes by international drug traffickers. 
Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the 
first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and 
ends in the United States and Europe. 
  Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces' 
participation will be essential for the operation's success. 
  "Operation Blockade" seeks to intercept the flow of cocaine 
on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river police 
patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the Manaus 
police. 
  The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions 
against drug traffickers in Colombia. 
  Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that 
includes 
the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine 
airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the 
large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of "Operation Blockade." 
  The operation also will include two radio centers, which 
began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas 
State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.

<F P=106> [Special report by Katia Brasil from Manaus, Brazil] </F>
  [Text] The Manaus Federal Superintendency will implement 
Operation Blockade [Operacao Bloqueio] using an intelligence 
network [rede de informacoes] that involves the Armed Forces of 
Brazil and of its neighboring countries, federal agencies, fuel 
distribution companies and some 200 federal policemen. The 
objective is to join forces against drug trafficking along the 
Amazon border region and get Brazil off the UN list of countries 
used as transit routes by drug cocaine. 
  Brazilian Federal Police Superintendent Mauro Sposito has 
said the strategy of Operation Blockade was discussed with 
Venezuelan, Peruvian, Colombian, and Bolivian military leaders 
during the Sixth Military Exchange meeting last week. So far 
only Brazil and Venezuela have formally agreed to participate. 
These two countries are at the start of the cocaine route that 
begins in Colombia and ends in the United State and Europe. The 
Colombian Army could lend its support to this project. Sposito 
said this will be essential if the operation is to be successful. 
  Operation Blockade will be conducted on four fronts. First, 
Tabatinga and Manaus river police patrols will intercept the 
cocaine that is shipped by the Amazon River. Second, 
enforcement actions in Colombia will be monitored. Third, 
flights of aircraft will be placed under surveillance: With the 
help of the Air Force, the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, 
ESSO, and Shell, the Federal Police will control the air space 
thus repressing traffickers who move cocaine by air. 
  The fourth front has been in action since November: Radio 
frequencies used by drug traffickers are being monitored from 
Tabatinga and Tefe. This led to the arrest of two drug bosses 
in Belem.

  [Excerpts] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 
today analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of 
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the 
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of 
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal 
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  Sanchez de Lozada today arrived in Argentina on an official 
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on 
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on 
investment promotion and guarantees. 
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received 
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's 
military section. 
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan 
Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of 
state the keys to the city. 
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez 
de 
Lozada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is 
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally 
in Argentina. 
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very 
important, 
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we 
will be able to stop this problem." [passage omitted] 
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Lozada said: 
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the 
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international 
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is 
something we cannot stop." 
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what 
is 
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing 
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador James Cheek on 14 March said that on 
21 March U.S. Vice President Al Gore will propose to President 
Carlos Menem the need for Congress to pass a law creating the 
status of repentant within a group of new legal weapons against 
drug trafficking. Cheek thus confirmed what was reported by 
CLARIN on 14 March. 
  In order that Gore's proposal not sound like diplomatic 
pressure, Secretary for the Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto 
Lestelle said "it is very probable" that Gore and President 
Menem will discuss this sensitive subject. "There is absolute 
coordination between Argentina and the United States on this 
subject," Lestelle pointed out. 
  During a news conference on 14 March to report on Gore's 
agenda here, Cheek said the "United States has been suggesting 
and endorsing the laws approved by Congress that, I understand, 
are supported by the Argentine Government and the majority of 
Congress." 
  In order to clarify any doubt, the U.S. ambassador added: 
"We have stressed the need for the approval of these laws in 
order to give the Argentine Government the necessary 
cooperation." In this manner, Cheek referred to the draft bills 
that create the status of repentant, informer, undercover agent, 
and controlled delivery of drug shipments, which the powerful 
DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) demands to make the 
struggle against drug trafficking in our country "more 
efficient." DEA experts believe that with these new laws drug 
traffickers can be fought "more efficiently." 
  Besides asking to approve these laws, Washington also wants 
the military to give their logistical support to the security 
forces in this struggle, although it understands that "for the 
time being" it is not necessary. U.S. Antinarcotics Under 
Secretary Robert Gelbard [title as published] last week gave 
signals about these two subjects to officials from the Argentine 
Foreign and Interior Ministries and the Secretariat for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse. 
  Following a ceremony in the Communications Secretariat 
headed 
by Oscar Gonzalez, Ambassador Cheek referred to the U.S. 
interest in the approval of a law including, among other 
subjects, the status of repentant. 
  The U.S. concern over these laws began to be expressed 
mainly 
after the Mar del Plata Penal Court for Economic Crimes released 
Colombian John Arroyave Arias, who was involved in the Shrimp 
Operation. 
  After learning about Cheek's statements, Lestelle said he 
believes the draft bill he sent to Congress 20 days ago "will be 
approved before the end of the year, if the congressmen decide 
so." 
  Lestelle added: "We rejected a draft bill approved by the 
lower house because it lacks the status of repentant." 
  Radical Civic Union [UCR] congressmen nonetheless unleashed 
a 
storm. UCR Deputy Gaston Ortiz Maldonado, vice president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Drug Addiction Committee, labelled 
Lestelle's decision to send a new draft bill to Congress as 
"untimely" given that the lower house already had approved a 
bill he himself drafted.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyright CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] The United States has reiterated its "subtle" 
request that the Argentine Government make antinarcotics action 
"more efficient" by opening two battle fronts. On the one hand, 
Washington wants more legal weaponry to be given to judges and 
to the police "this year," incorporating -- for example -- the 
case of "repented" persons in Argentine law, in reducing the 
penalty of detainees who provide information on drug trafficking. 
  The U.S. administration also pointed to the need for the 
military to provide logistical support (without engaging in 
combat with drug traffickers) to security forces. Foreign 
diplomatic sources, however, have told CLARIN that the powerful 
DEA (the U.S. antinarcotics agency) believes that "for the time 
being" this step is not necessary. 
  These precise and clear signals of what Washington wants 
were 
conveyed by DEA head Robert Gelbard [as published] to officials 
at the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the 
Antinarcotics Secretariat during his stay in Buenos Aires last 
week. 
  The sole reference to the Argentine military becoming 
indirectly engaged in the fight prompted a debate within the 
government, causing its anticipated rejection by the military. 
  However, according to the same sources -- who preferred to 
remain anonymous -- the DEA has another priority that comes 
before this one: incorporating, among others, the following 
provisions in the antinarcotics legislation: 
  Informers: Depenalize the actions of persons who, while not 
being criminals, provide information about drug traffickers. 
  The repented: Judges should be allowed to reduce penalties 
in return for information. This case is regulated by law in 
other countries. In Spain, for example, it was applied to the 
case of "repented" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who reported to Spanish 
judges the Argentine connection of an international dollar 
laundering gang, which originated the so-called Yoma affair in 
Argentina. 
  Undercover agents: Policemen should be allowed to infiltrate 
traffickers' organizations, under judicial branch control. 
  Judicial branch controlled shipping: International drug 
trafficking operations should be allowed to continue in order to 
arrest the gang in the receiving country. 
  The objective of these measures, which are added to the 
reiterated claim for increasing control over the "laundering" of 
narco-dollars, is to prevent the crimes linked with drug 
trafficking and to try to catch the heads of the organizations. 
  DEA priorities for Argentina are consistent with the U.S. 
concern about the releasing of Colombian John Arrayave Arias, 
one of the men involved in the "Shrimp Operation." 
  However, and despite the fact that Secretary for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle has submitted a bill 
with several of these measures, Peronist Deputies and Senators 
are not too enthusiastic about "adjusting" the legislation in 
this regard. Opposition sources in Congress maintain that the 
first two provisions in particular will, in addition to 
contributing to fighting drugs, facilitate investigations into 
reports on corruption. 
  During a stay in Buenos Aires on his way back to Washington, 
Gelbard was seen in Recoleta on Friday, in an informal lunch 
with Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros. 
  The statements by the U.S. principal deputy assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Michael Skol, 
that the Latin American military should engage in logistical 
support actions in the antinarcotics fight has revealed that the 
Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry disagree on this 
controversial proposal. (Skol proposed that the Armed Forces 
cooperate in intelligence, transportation, logistics, and river, 
coast, and airspace control activities). 
  "The Armed Forces should not have any type of engagement 
whatsoever, because antinarcotics action is a police task," said 
a high-ranking Defense Ministry source consulted by CLARIN. 
This opinion is shared by the Radical Civic Union. 
  Before adopting that position, Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion consulted with the four chiefs of staff about the 
proposal. According to military sources, the answer was 
unanimous: It is not a central or a secondary mission of the 
Armed Forces. 
  However, considering that drug trafficking is a growing 
problem, Camilion is advocating the idea of "giving more 
infrastructure" to the Border Police, to the National 
Prefecture, and to the Police, instead of engaging the Argentine 
military in the fight against this scourge. 
  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, however, adopted a 
legalistic position: Argentina "has already fulfilled" the 
request by Skol by including in the National Defense Law a 
provision under the terms of which the Armed Forces will be 
allowed to intervene in the hypothetical cases in which drug 
traffickers overwhelm security forces, high-ranking Foreign 
Ministry sources told CLARIN.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Mar (NA) -- Secretary for the 
Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto Lestelle today said that the 
Armed Forces "should not interfere" in the antinarcotics effort 
in Argentina, because "the security organizations are 
effectively conducting this struggle." 
  Lestelle emphasized his viewpoint by comparing Argentina to 
Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and the United States. He said 
Argentina "does not have problems as serious as theirs to 
justify the Armed Forces' participation in this struggle." 
  He also said that the Argentine Government has "fully" 
agreed 
with the United States on the need "to update Argentine laws, 
which are the legal basis for this difficult struggle." 
  Lestelle admitted, however, having received a specific 
request from Robert Gelbard, the number two man in the Drug 
Enforcement Administration [as received] in this regard, as was 
stated in an article published today in the Buenos Aires press. 
He explained that this issue has already been discussed at the 
Inter-American Commission for Drug Abuse Prevention. 
  Lestelle also asserted that there is a bill modifying the 
law 
that penalizes drug trafficking. He explained that "the only 
pending aspect of the problem is that related to informers." 
  He pointed out: "We have met with some congressmen to make 
sure that the figure of the informer is included in the law, 
thus ensuring that it includes the four elements -- the 
informer, the repentant drug trafficker, the undercover agent, 
and the court-monitored drug delivery -- and thus help justice 
to function better." 
  Lestelle favors inclusion of the "repentant drug trafficker" 
in the current laws, "as long as it has legal bases." 
  He emphasized: "With legal protection enabling the person to 
appear before the courts and report on whatever it is required, 
people will act responsibly, will not flee the country, and will 
logically not be saying just any nonsense." 
  Lestelle said this was not the case of the well-known 
"repentant drug trafficker" Andy Cruz Iglesias, who told the 
Spanish judges about Argentine connections with an international 
dollar laundering gang, which was the source of the so-called 
"Yomagate" case in Argentina. 
  "The judge deemed Andy Iglesias' remarks valid, but reality 
showed that the data reported by Iglesias were not that 
correct," Lestelle said. 
  Referring to the repercussions in Argentina of Iglesias' 
testimony, Lestelle said: "It is not necessary to tell the 
truth for a scandal to arise." He added: "The required legal 
action was adopted, and the appropriate people contacted." 
  In conclusion, Lestelle rejected demonstrations in favor of 
the legalization of drug use, and warned that "the economic 
excuses used in this regard have no foundation, because to 
legalize the drug it would be necessary to produce the drug in 
the country. To do this we would have to build drug processing 
laboratories, and these would have to be controlled by the 
central government, as occurs in the case of laboratories that 
produce medicine."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- In various operations 
conducted in the federal capital and in greater Buenos Aires, 
the police have seized nearly 200 kg of cocaine and arrested 
over 25 people. This has been the hardest blow dealt to drug 
trafficking this year. 
  Judge Juan Jose Galeano headed an operation conducted in 
Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, during which police found more 
than 50 kg of cocaine that had been "artistically" hidden inside 
five wooden doors that had been carefully constructed for this 
illegal act. 
  This operation led the Federal Police to raid the "Buenos 
Aires" warehouse in the Pompeya district, where they found 15 
similar doors with dozens of bricks of cocaine inside. 
  According to Police Inspector Norberto Ruiz, who was in 
charge of the operation, the "merchandise" had been brought from 
Jujuy in a station wagon belonging to the freight company "La 
Sevillanita." 
  Ruiz reported that neither those responsible for the 
warehouse nor the freight company managers were apparently 
involved in smuggling the drugs. 
  The operation was the fruit of "four months of 
investigations," Ruiz pointed out. He added that the agents 
assigned to the operation hadn't slept for 48 hours. 
  According to reports the merchandise kept at the "Buenos 
Aires Warehouse" was to have been picked up by a drug trafficker 
identified as Adrian Flores. This name, however, could be false. 
  Judge Galeano said he was "very satisfied" with the results 
of the investigation, and praised the policemen's performance in 
helping solve the case. 
  When the policemen took apart the doors they realized that 8 
kg of highly pure cocaine were hidden inside each door, though 
some doors were heavier than others. 
  The court officials pointed out that more raids and arrests 
will result from the operation, because the gang probably has 
connections in Jujuy Province and in other regions of the 
country.

  [Text] Police headquarters in Belmopan has launched a top 
flight investigation into the activities of its Belize City 
Special Branch Squad after discovering more than ten kilos of 
confiscated cocaine worth more than $350,000 on the black 
market, missing from its strong vault in Eastern Division 
Headquarters. 
  Reports say the heat is being focused on two veterans of the 
Force, both trusted members of Special Branch, who have become 
crooked cops. 
  Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga Wednesday appointed a top 
brass investigative team headed by Assistant Commissioner Ornell 
Brooks. The two others are Senior Superintendent Alvan Rowland 
and Superintendent Raymond Thimbrell. Two officers who have not 
been identified have been detained, and reports say, one or more 
arrests are imminent. 
  Police Commissioner Zuniga has promised he will hold a press 
briefing when the investigations are complete. 
  Police first knew that something was seriously wrong on 
Tuesday when a package of 2.1 kilograms of confiscated cocaine 
with special police markings to identify it turned up on the 
streets of Belize City. 
  Last Tuesday night the police busted three guys who were 
trying to peddle the stuff in front of the Fort George Radisson. 
During some intense questioning police learned the name of at 
least one officer working with the Crimes Investigation Bureau. 
  The investigation has been expanded to include the police 
Sergeant in charge of the Police strong room where confiscated 
drugs are kept under lock and key. 
  The Police image has been tarnished time after time by 
crooked cops who commit crimes and get off with just a rap on 
the wrist. This time however there is every indication that 
Police Commissioner Sherman Zuniga will press criminal charges 
which could lead to extended jail sentences for the guilty 
officers.

  [Text] La Paz, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Expressing their position in 
defense of coca, the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) and the 
Tahuantinsuyo Authentic Indian Front (FIAT) today labeled the 
stopovers U.S. Vice President Al Gore will make in the La Paz 
and Santa Cruz airports as "non grata." 
  Gore, his wife, and official delegation are making their 
first trip to several South American countries. They will make 
a five-hour stopover in Bolivia on 20 March en route to Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. 
  Union leader Toribio Hinojosa said: "Mr. Gore's visit would 
be fine if he came to make a commitment to stop the forced coca 
eradication but we know he comes to increase pressure for the 
continuation of coca destruction." 
  The FIAT issued a communique in which they say the U.S. 
Government and vice president are "enemies of the sacred coca, 
and he is coming to eradicate it." 
  The greatest advantage will be taken from Gore's five-hour 
stay in Bolivia on his way to Argentina. Official reports state 
that he will be declared guest of honor in La Paz and Santa 
Cruz, even though he will not visit those cities. 
  Local officials are preparing a folk music show of the 
Altiplano and the tropical regions, and will give him presents. 
  During the 45-minute flight from La Paz to Santa Cruz, Gore 
will meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and 
his Bolivian counterpart Victor Hugo Cardenas. 
  Vice President Gore will also meet the Bolivian Government 
economic team in the Santa Cruz Viru-Viru Airport. 
  The Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy are working on 
the final details of Gore's arrival in the midst of strict 
security measures at the airports of the two cities. 
  The highway from La Paz to Lake Titicaca will be closed for 
about three hours and security will be strengthened at the two 
airports to guarantee Gore's security. 
  Gore will leave the La Paz El Alto international airport, 
located about 15 km from downtown La Paz, for Achica Abajo -- by 
Lake Titicaca -- which is the town where Bolivian Vice President 
Cardenas was born. He will return to the airport and leave for 
Santa Cruz. 
  The signing of several agreements between the two 
governments 
was also announced and, if time allows, a brief meeting with the 
media at the Santa Cruz airport will be held.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada </F>
by Stella Ruffinelli; from the "Coordinates" program; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ruffinelli: You have 
said that consensus represents a basic element for strengthening 
our democratic processes. Before your election, you had to 
achieve a mini-consensus to guarantee your second attempt to 
become president. How do you view this now you are president? 
How can a consensus be achieved? 
  Sanchez: Well, political dynamics, especially as 
we see it in Europe, involves opposition politics, that is, the 
opposition, the ruling party, and all that. 
  Nevertheless, there comes a time when a consensus must be 
reached, and many criticized me over this when I was in the 
opposition. 
  Through fraud and the fact that the second placed party 
voted 
for those placed third, if a majority vote is not achieved in 
Bolivia, you have to resort to Congress. It is almost 
impossible to achieve an absolute majority. 
  Ruffinelli: You were elected by Congress. 
  Sanchez: Yes, even though my election, my victory, 
was overwhelming -- I received 15 percent more than the second 
placed candidate. In a proportional representation vote system, 
it is impossible to receive more than 50 percent of the votes. 
Yet the Bolivian Constitution states that if you do not receive 
an absolute majority of the votes, you have to resort to 
Congress. 
  Ruffinelli: Do you have the support of two thirds 
of the Senate? 
  Sanchez: Yes. 
  Ruffinelli: And a good portion or a significant 
portion of the Chamber of Deputies? 
  Sanchez: We have an absolute majority in the 
Chamber of Deputies. A consensus is required when you draft 
significant measures to really transform society. 
Privatizations, the people's participation program, and 
education reform are revolutionary measures that the people 
eagerly want, but many people, especially the teachers, oppose 
it. When you design significant measures to transform society, 
a consensus is required. This does not mean it must be 
unanimous, but a consensus is essential because it is not enough 
to have a majority in Congress. All parties must decide that 
the time to reach an agreement has come. We will never agree on 
every measure because a government has to rule. These are 
significant measures which involve the changes and 
transformations required by current times -- because these are 
times of change--and we must try to achieve a consensus. 
  Ruffinelli: Emphasis has also been placed on the 
corruption issue and how to handle it. You have drug 
trafficking and other fairly difficult measures to solve. How 
are you handling the corruption issue? 
  Sanchez: We believe the privatization program 
will help to solve the corruption problem. Under a pluralist 
democratic process, we believe it is incompatible for the state 
to manage economic activities. If you manage state-owned 
enterprises well, you may not lose votes because you will be 
firing people and running the operation very efficiently. If 
you manage them poorly, if you start hiring your fellow party 
members, the enterprise will perform poorly and the services 
will be lousy. This is also bad. 
  We believe it is necessary to radically decentralize our 
country, to remove the state from economic activities, 
transferring them the private area. We must do it through 
privatizations in which the enterprises are not sold to foreign 
capital or directly to private capital, but in which the people 
themselves participate. 
  Second, with this participation of the people, certain roles 
will be transferred to the municipal governments and others to 
rural communities and urban neighborhoods. Like this we believe 
we will achieve the dynamics needed to exercise control. When 
the people control, there is no corruption. In a neighborhood 
or a small town, the people know exactly what is being done and 
who is doing it. We believe this mechanism of decentralization, 
through the people's participation in privatizations, will allow 
them to control. This is not merely a moral or personal 
problem, it is an institutional problem. 
  When there is excessive centralization, it is very difficult 
to control, regardless of the government's good intentions and 
efforts. 
  Ruffinelli: I want to return to the trafficking 
issue, because it also is somewhat linked to what is happening 
here. Concerning the coca issue, you are, let's say, free to 
grow it, but not to process it. But the United States wants it 
eradicated. 
  Sanchez: There are regions in Bolivia where coca 
was being grown before the arrival of the Spaniards. This coca, 
however, is very special. It is grown in high-altitude regions. 
This coca requires hard work. It is carefully grown, 
harvested, and dried. 
  There are other new regions where another type of coca is 
grown, a coca that is unsuitable for the traditional purpose of 
chewing or in typical Bolivian rites. This coca is used by 
traffickers. 
  We are now trying to control it and convince Bolivians to 
voluntarily replace coca with alternative development crops. It 
also involves paying them for each hectare they eradicate. It 
is not easy because it is not easy to find a crop that will 
really replace coca production. Nevertheless, we must wage this 
war because, thank God, the narco-guerrillas and drug cartels 
have not yet reached Bolivia. We are very scared because we had 
a military government that was totally at the service of drug 
trafficking. 
  Ruffinelli: [Former Bolivian President Luis] 
Garcia Meza's detention in Brazil has probably created a little 
problem for your government. Even though it is a relief, it 
also represents a little problem. In Brazil, he said he did not 
govern alone. Coming from a former president, this is 
politically significant. What does this mean to you? 
  Sanchez: We believe corruption cannot be concealed 
and, if he has something to say, I would be pleased to hear it. 
It is also necessary to be very careful about reports from a 
man sentenced by the Supreme Court to 30 years in prison, and 
who has been at large. 
  Ruffinelli: But there still are pockets of 
authoritarianism and corruption that have not been removed from 
the Bolivian society. 
  Sanchez: Obviously. There are many, but I want 
to tell you that my party, the Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement, reached the government in 1985, through our leader and 
founder Victor Paz Estenssoro. We inherited a 23,400-percent 
hyperinflation ... 
  Ruffinelli: [interrupting] Was it your program or 
was it a program ...? 
  Sanchez: Well now, a program ... [pauses] He 
transferred me from the Senate presidency to the Planning and 
Coordination Ministry, and we were able to curtail 
hyperinflation. 
  I have become president and there is hyper-corruption. I 
will not be able to totally wipe out corruption, because it has 
been imbued in humanity since Eve gave Adam an apple. This will 
not ... [pauses] We do not want hyper-corruption. We want 
single-digit corruption, controllable corruption in which 
coexistence is possible. 
  Ruffinelli: You do not want it to become a 
standard. 
  Sanchez: Correct. As I have just said, we do not 
want hyper-corruption. We do not want such serious corruption. 
Yet, it is not easy. As with hyperinflation and inflation, 
corruption must be reduced with very radical, clear, and 
unrelenting measures. By the time I leave the government, I 
hope to leave a country in which corruption has not entirely 
been wiped out, but where it has been reduced to a level that 
can be managed and controlled by the courts and society.

  [Text] La Paz, 13 Dec (EFE) -- Various politicians said 
today that former Bolivian President Luis Garcia Meza, who was 
detained in Brazil, could involve many of the active members of 
Bolivian politics in the actions of his de facto government 
(1980-1981) for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
  Deputy Benjamin Miguel of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) said today that Garcia Meza is quite "smart to do that ... 
to try to stain with his accusations many people who now appear 
to be democrats and respectful of the Constitution but who 
encouraged the military dictatorships." 
  Garcia Meza, who was detained on 11 March by Brazilian 
police 
in Sao Paulo, said: "I am paying for the things others did and 
I will prove it." 
  Deputy Miguel, who lived in exile during the Garcia Meza 
government, said, "the former dictator has nothing to lose" and 
he will try to get the greatest political advantage from his 
declarations before and after he is extradited to Bolivia. 
  The La Paz morning daily HOY says in an editorial on 12 
March 
that there is "fear of Garcia Meza," and that "this time the 
people are not the ones who are afraid of this character, but 
his old allies and Bolivian politicians who are about to get 
another bucket of water" from the former dictator. 
  Juan del Granado, a lawyer in the civic lawsuit of the 
so-called "Trial of the Century" against Garcia Meza that lasted 
seven years, labeled the former dictator a "liar and forgetful." 
He said, however, that whatever Garcia Meza says will serve to 
open the case again against new people who were involved in the 
criminals acts committed by the former general. 
  Miguel Urioste, leader of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) 
that is in the government coalition, said that "the two previous 
governments protected the former dictator" in reference to 
former President Victor Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) and Jaime Paz 
Zamora (1989-1993). The first because it let him go and the 
second because it did not want to arrest him. 
  Urioste added: "I hope Garcia Meza is man enough to accuse 
his accomplices, accessories, and protectors, and that the heads 
that must roll begin to roll." 
  The MBL announced that it will propose in the next few days 
that the Constitution, Justice, and Judicial Police Committee of 
the Chamber of Deputies investigate the protection given to 
Garcia Meza by people linked to current Bolivian politics and 
diplomacy. 
  Deputy Eduardo Paz of the opposition Conscience of the 
Fatherland (Condepa) said that all those who cooperated with the 
Garcia Meza government should be "unmasked." He supports any 
initiative to identify the former dictator's accessories during 
the five years he remained a fugitive from justice. 
  According to a "confidential" report released by the local 
FIDES news agency, more than 100 people have covered up for 
Garcia Meza in Bolivia including soldiers, congressmen, close 
friends, relatives, and people who benefited in administrative 
and political positions during the de facto government from July 
1980 to August 1981. 
  The Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced Garcia Meza on 21 April 
1993 to the stiffest sentence, 30 years in jail, for nine crimes 
of sedition, murder, malfeasance, and stealing government 
property.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Feb -- While being evicted from the 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] offices in Ivirgarzama -- in 
the subtropical region of Cochabamba Department early on the 
morning of 26 February -- three peasants were injured and 60 
were arrested and later released. 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga supplied this 
information and denied that anyone had been killed, as certain 
news media had reported. He said firearms were not used to 
evict over 1,500 peasants who invaded the Direco offices 
protesting the alleged compulsory eradication of their coca 
plantations. [passage omitted] 
  The minister reported that approximately 70 coca maceration 
pits have been discovered in the outskirts of Ivirgarzama in 
recent weeks. It is estimated that these maceration pits 
produced 3.5 metric tons of cocaine base per month. The 
discovery of these pits was the main cause for the eradication 
of some plantations in compliance with current laws. There was 
no compulsory eradication of plantations as claimed by the 
peasants who invaded the Direco offices in Ivirgarzama 
  Minister Quiroga said: "Relative calm has been restored and 
an agreement has been reached with the five federations of the 
tropical area of Cochabamba Department to begin talks during the 
first week of March to fully explain what Mobile Police Unit for 
Rural Areas personnel are doing and to give peasants the chance 
to speak." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Even though Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
said on 26 February that the so-called "Option Zero" -- which 
envisages the total eradication of surplus coca plantations -- 
is only a proposal and that its implementation depends on the 
international community providing the necessary economic aid, 
peasant leaders assert that it is already under way. 
  Soliz stated: "`Option Zero' is just a proposal. We must 
study it. This will take some time. No definite decision has 
been taken. It is a proposal by certain echelons of the 
government that we must assess. We must see what funds are 
available to implement it in the Chapare region." 
  In the view of several peasant leaders who spoke to this 
daily on the evening of 26 February, the violent action 
yesterday by FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] personnel in 
Chapare proves that the "proposal" to eradicate surplus 
plantations is already underway. Minister of Government German 
Quiroga denied such an outrage. 
  Soliz stated that until the proposal is made official, the 
U.S. Embassy in Bolivia cautiously awaits an outcome while 
monitoring further developments in the problem with coca growers. 
  He said: "They are waiting to make a more thorough 
assessment 
and to see how much money can be collected for this project. 
This must be supported by nations and international 
organizations with which we have friendly ties and which can 
give us the necessary funding." 
  This cautious U.S. stance was maintained by George A. 
Auflick, the DEA chief in Bolivia who, during a brief encounter 
with the press yesterday, declined to comment. 
  Soliz denied that opposition by the peasants to eradication 
will lead to clashes with Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco) 
officials who -- supported by FELCN troops -- have already 
eradicated some surplus plantations. 
  The tense atmosphere in Chapare robs Soliz's optimistic 
words 
of any credibility. 
  "The peasants are well aware that we are acting within the 
law. Moreover, the volume of plantations eradicated so far is 
negligible," he stated, emphasizing that the eradication of "a 
few hectares of illegal plantations" was done near where 
maceration pits had been discovered by the FELCN and that were 
used exclusively for the production of cocaine paste. 
  Given the desire to fully eradicate surplus plantations, the 
five coca growers federations from Chapare demand what they call 
"Option One" -- the expulsion of all DEA agents. 
  During a interview with PRESENCIA last week, Soliz conceded 
that the proposal should be given careful consideration although 
he stated he did not know the reasons for this demand. 
  He said: "We cannot decide yet on something that we still do 
not know about ("Option One"), but we will certainly assess the 
role the DEA is playing in our country." 
  He added: "We must see how it can be beneficial for the 
country and how not. I believe we must investigate and seriously 
analyze what is right for us and what should be definitely 
discarded because it does not suit us." 
  On 14 February, coca growers from Chapare alleged that FELCN 
personnel, in coordination with DEA agents and Direco officials, 
compulsorily eradicated coca plantations. 
  This action is considered by peasants as the start of the 
total eradication of their plantations under the so-called 
"Option Zero." Even though this was denied by Soliz, he 
acknowledged that "there is concern in Chapare over what has 
been done (the eradication of illegal coca plantations) in 
keeping with the law." 
  This assessment sharply contrasts with that of coca growers, 
who noted that "they will not allow their plantations to be 
eradicated." 
  During a rally of coca growers last 18 February, Felix 
Santos, a peasants' leader, expressed this feeling by openly 
challenging the country's drug enforcement agencies. He stated: 
"If enforcement agencies kick us, we will club them; if they 
destroy our plantations, we will cut off their hands." 
  In light of the determination of the government, the 
peasants 
are demanding that "Option One" be implemented. Their leaders 
explained that this option entails the expulsion of all DEA 
agents, which could be analyzed by the government although there 
is a very remote possibility of this happening because U.S. 
economic aid to our country foresees the eradication of 
plantations. Let us hope this does not bring serious 
consequences in its wake.

  [Text] Rio police have cut out the middlemen. They 
themselves are handing out rifles and drugs to the criminal 
elements who have set up shop in the Rio shantytowns. These 
figures are the target of an extensive investigation by the 
Federal Police (PF) that has already produced a dossier with 
about 50 names. Checking into the circumstances that led to the 
arrest of Detective Luiz Eduardo Sato and police informant Luiz 
Alexandre Ferreira, who were picked up on 4 February when they 
were carrying 22 kg of cocaine paste and ammunition for heavy 
weapons to the Andarai hillside, could help dismantle the 
connection between criminals dressed up as police and a branch 
of the international drug traffic. 
  This hope was expressed by Lieutenant Governor and Secretary 
of the Civil Police Nilo Batista himself, speaking on the same 
day when the two were arrested. "If Detective Sato cooperates, 
the scheme used by traffickers from other countries to work in 
Brazil might be unveiled," Batista suggested. The problem is 
that, as one might expect, neither of the two prisoners seems 
willing to cooperate with the investigations. Sato, who has 
already been called to answer two administrative inquiries and 
has been separated from police work for two years now, said in 
his deposition at the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) of the 
Civil Police that he had been told that traffickers from Andarai 
had received a shipment of drugs and so had decided to go up to 
the hill with the informant and seize the material. That was 
what he did. Using a car from the 37th Police Precinct on 
Governor's Island, he cleared the barricades set up by the 
bandits, went up the hill without being bothered, picked up the 
cocaine and the ammunition, and came back down. Not even Rambo 
could have done as well. 
  The detective's explanation, however, is demolished when one 
remembers that policemen who have been separated from the 
service cannot carry out any kind of official operation. 
Furthermore, no one believes that a police car would find it so 
easy to reach the headquarters of the traffickers unless it had 
the consent of the hoodlums. "If two men acting alone can 
accomplish that kind of feat, I should start thinking about 
firing the troops from the Drug Enforcement Division, which has 
never done anything of the sort," commented Chief Walter 
Oliveira, who is in charge of the DRE. It was the ease with 
which Sato and Ferreira's car drove around the Andarai hillside 
that attracted the attention of the military police, who ended 
up arresting the two. 
  The episode of the arrest, by the way, shows that there are 
many other interests behind Sato and Ferreira. The military 
police who stopped the two met with resistance from agents on 
duty at the 20th Police Precinct in Grajau, who refused to 
record the event on the police blotter. This was not done until 
after newspaper and magazine reporters arrived, having been 
mobilized by the MP's themselves. Furthermore, the detective and 
informant gave no convincing explanations as to why they were 
driving a police car without being authorized to do official 
work, and there are suspicions that agents from the Governor's 
Island precinct had cooperated with Sato. The head of the 37th 
precinct, Chief Jorge Barros, who could not explain this either, 
was relieved of his duties. 
  Even if they do not provide any good leads for the Civil 
Police investigation, Sato and Ferreira are important pieces of 
the puzzle that the Federal Police are putting together. They 
are thought to be part of a gang that, according to police, is 
headed by Otto Gomes de Miranda, a black-market dealer in 
dollars who distributes cocaine, weapons, and ammunition on the 
hills of Rio de Janeiro. Miranda was arrested in Miami in April 
1991 because he had been caught trying to return to Brazil with 
13 AR-15 rifles and 55 machine guns and pistols. This 
dollar-trader and trafficker is at liberty in Rio since the 
police have not gathered enough evidence to arrest him. 
  Although the investigations are only halfway completed, the 
arrest of Detective Sato and informant Ferreira has already had 
the effect of transforming an uncomfortable suspicion into a 
dramatic certainty: some Rio police are now sharing with the 
criminals the dirty work of the drug traffic. So, a reversal of 
roles that has been in the works for a long time has become a 
reality. It contributes to a situation where, with every passing 
day, the people of Rio de Janeiro become more afraid -- of both 
the bandits and those who are supposed to be enforcing the laws.

<F P=106> [Article by Fabio Lau] </F>
  [Text] He is only eight years old, does not attend school, 
and says he is proud that he can already earn his own money -- 
CR$7,000 [cruzeiros] a week. "C" "works" on a flight of steps on 
a hillside in a shantytown in the Alemao Complex, in Penha as a 
lookout for an indoor drug market [boca-de-fumo]. He 
flies a kite that is no longer a toy; it has become a tool in 
his "work," used to warn of the arrival of police or rival 
bandits. "C" is one of the 5,000 minors who, according to Drug 
Enforcement Division estimates, work for the traffickers. In 
fact, children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 17 make 
up 80 to 90 percent of the labor force marshalled by the drug 
traffic. 
  The olheiro, or lookout, is the first step on this 
"career ladder." Next, minors can be used as 
vapozeiros (packagers of drugs) and "airplanes" 
(distributors). Those two jobs pay weekly wages ranging from 
CR$7,000 to CR$30,000. In some cases, however, the kids hold 
more important "offices" such as managers, or even bosses, of 
the indoor drug markets. This is the case in the Chale 
shantytown in Mangueira, where the boss, "F," turned 14 on 4 
January. His gang is composed of children, young men, and even 
adults who follow his orders. 
  There are two factors behind the increasingly significant 
presence of boys and adolescents in the indoor drug markets, 
according to police: the fact that they are minors and so cannot 
be given long sentences; and the type of relationship -- blind 
loyalty -- they develop with the traffickers. Their youth gives 
them an impulsiveness that makes them heedless of physical 
safety in a way an adult would not be. "They are just the 
wadding for the cannons," a policeman said. 
<H5>  "B," Age 16 </H5>
  "B" is confined at the Padre Severino Institute for the 
third 
time. The first time was for theft, then for robbery, now he is 
there for trafficking. "I lived in the Fatima neighborhood, and 
that was where I had my first contact with drugs. I was 12. I 
started stealing things on my street. I got a reputation 
[manjado] and started stealing things on buses, 
working with four others. I bought a Browning 9 mm. Then I was 
arrested and spent some time here. My parents began to hate me. 
I got out and started school again. That didn't last long and I 
went back to look for my buddies there in Querosene (a 
shantytown in Catumbi). I used to guard the hillside in the 
evenings (I was a `soldier') and I was paid in cocaine. I was 
arrested trying to stick up a gas station. I came back here. 
Almost a year later, I was back on the street. I got a lot of 
money from a deal with the owner of the boca and set 
up my own business there in Fatima. I used to buy 50 grams of 
pura (pure cocaine) and stretch it into 500 grams. I 
would invest $300 and turn it into $3,000 a week. I bought a 
motorcycle, fulfilling my greatest dream. But then I got caught 
and so I'm back here." 
<H5>  "R," Age 17 </H5>
  A soldier for trafficker Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka "Ue," 
in 
one of the shantytowns in the Alemao Complex in Penha, "R" was 
found standing with "C," age 8, on a flight of steps on the 
hillside. Armed with a Glock 9mm pistol, he says he lives very 
well on the CR$30,000 he gets every week. "In the days when I 
helped a friend in construction, I didn't earn enough money to 
go dancing on Saturday night. Now I have these Company tennis 
shoes, brand new. As a laborer I could never buy anything like 
these. I learned to shoot and the man (Ue) noticed that my hand 
is steady. He gave me the Glock, the best pistol in the 
shantytown." 
<H5>  "D," Age 16 </H5>
  He is one of the 196 inmates at the Padre Severino Institute 
and this is his fourth stay there. Reason: drug trafficking. He 
says that at first he resisted the call of the traffickers. "My 
brothers are drug dealers for Jorge Luiz (boss of the traffic in 
Acari, Coroado, and Conjunto Amarelinho). They wanted me to join 
the group, but I was afraid. I was about 11. I started going to 
Copacabana with my friends from the neighborhood. They went 
there to rob the gringos and I started stealing, too -- and 
sniffing cocaine. I bought it in Acari, where it was cheaper. 
The guys pressured me to take drugs and sell them on the beach. 
I agreed and I earned good money, but was arrested four times. 
It was not an easy life, but it was a good life, because it paid 
for clothes. My father, a factory worker, earns very little. My 
mother, a servant in Copacabana -- same story." 
<H5>  A Short Lifespan for the Little Bosses </H5>
  Minors who reach the top die early. Brasileirinho, Maguinho, 
and Pimentinha could bear witness to the fact that a childhood 
spent in the world of drugs leads nowhere. They reached the top 
of the hierarchy in the world of drugs in Rio's shantytowns at a 
very early age. They were cut down even sooner. All three were 
killed before their 16th birthdays. 
  Joel Oliveira de Souza, aka "Pimentinha," was killed in 
September 1993 at the age of 15, after a shootout between the 
police and the traffickers in Acari. After being arrested along 
with a group of traffickers, he bled for more than four hours 
and died of a hemorrhage. 
  Flavio da Conceicao Augusto, aka "Brasileirinho," did not 
live as long -- only to age 14. As one of the bosses in the drug 
traffic in the Rocinha shantytown, Brasileirinho was killed 
after the police discovered the hideout used by a group of eight 
people at a country house in Sao Goncalo. Among the dead were 
Erik Melo Alves, 20, son of Judge Marilene Melo Alves, and two 
pregnant girls. 
  Carlos Magno Barbosa, aka "Maguinho," died at 14, also the 
victim of a confrontation with the police. He had gained 
notoriety when, during an exchange of gunfire against his former 
ally Ricardo Ferreira da Conceicao, aka "Cambarra," on a sunny 
Sunday on Ipanema beach, Angela Lopes Machado, an engineer, was 
hit by a stray bullet and died. 
<H5>  Gangs Imitate Military Hierarchy </H5>
  The investigative work done by Chief Maurilio Moreira when 
he 
headed the 19th police precinct (Tijuca) produced 11 volumes of 
inquiries -- forwarded to the 26th Criminal Court -- listing 132 
traffickers in Borel for whom arrest warrants had been issued. 
On the basis of that information, the chief learned that the 
traffickers attempt to imitate the military organizational 
structure. The trafficker is portrayed to his underlings as the 
commander of a military unit. Furthermore, the members of the 
gang are promoted on the basis of merit, dedication, and 
discipline. 
  "We have come to the conclusion that many young men in Borel 
are encouraged by the drug traffickers to enter military service 
as an apprenticeship. They stay long enough to learn how to 
handle weapons and explosives, and they are assigned to take 
weapons and grenades, which we often find in possession of the 
criminals," the police chief said. 
  The top figure in the organizational structure of the drug 
traffic, according to the police, is the matuto, the 
supplier. Under him is the boss of the traffic for a given 
shantytown. Attached to him is a group of "soldiers," 
(bodyguards), who go everywhere with him. Then come the 
"managers" of the "white stuff" (cocaine), and the "black stuff" 
(marijuana), and these people also have bodyguards. They share 
their territory with "assistant managers" who distribute the 
drugs among the bocas-de-fumo. Vapozeiros 
prepare the narcotics for retail sale, make up the blends and 
return them to the "managers." "Soldiers" at the "bocas" provide 
protection and are partly responsible for the sales. 
  Sales are not restricted to the shantytowns. Some of the 
drugs are taken by "airplanes" to places where addicts gather. 
They are allowed to raise the price, provided they observe the 
payment terms agreed to with the "managers." If the drugs are 
seized by the police, the addict-dealer must still pay for them. 
Debts to traffickers are neither forgiven nor negotiated. You 
pay with your life. 
<H5>  Ten Percent of Crimes Committed by Minors Are Drug-Related </H5>
  During the first ten months of 1993, the Children and 
Adolescents Protection Division (DPCA) recorded a total of 1,166 
crimes committed by children and young people between the ages 
of 7 and 18. Of this total, about 120 cases were related to 
consumption or dealing in drugs. 
  In the opinion of Judge Siro Darlan, of the 2nd Juvenile 
Court, the majority of the robbery or thefts committed by young 
people are drug-related. "The adolescent steals something, sells 
to a fence -- usually an adult -- and immediately goes out and 
buys drugs," the judge said. 
  The pressures on minors who engage in the traffic are also 
irresistible, according to the judge. "Those who are attracted 
by the traffic receive the kind of wages that a legal activity 
would almost never pay them. They start supporting their 
families and, in some cases, even gain their parents' sympathy. 
But in general, they are victims of a system in which you earn a 
lot, but you don't live long." 
<H5>  The Public Square by Day, Drug Market by Night </H5>
  "S," age 13, is an example of the vicious circle the minors 
involved with drugs are caught up in. Last Tuesday afternoon, he 
was in Saenz Pena Square with three friends. "S" told O GLOBO 
reporters that he is a compulsive user of cocaine. The money to 
buy it comes from thefts. The "fence," he said, is a 19-year-old. 
  "I stopped sniffing for awhile because my nose was sore. 
Now, 
I'm in great shape. I spend the day on the square and at night I 
go to Sa Viana," (the street that leads to one of the principal 
bocas-de-fumo on the Andarai hillside). 
  The kids on Saenz Pena Square have been getting help for two 
years from the 6th BPM [Military Police Battalion] (Tijuca). The 
coordinator of the Special Crime Prevention Unit, Lieutenant 
Marcelo Luiz Ribeiro de Almeida, has succeeded in cutting the 
number of crimes on the square by 70 percent since he started a 
project there. Many of the young people were taken to the BPM, 
where they are learning a trade. 
  A defender of the Child and Adolescent Statute, the 
lieutenant said that it was drafted with the Brazilian reality 
in mind and should be enforced in its essence. "Every child can 
be rehabilitated," he said.

<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  Narcotics agents on 8 March arrested a person surnamed 
Cespedes Quiros and seized 27 kg of marijuana during an 
undercover operation which was frustrated by drug traffickers 
who wounded a policeman in El Peje, Volcan de Buenos Aires, 
Puntarenas. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 10 March 94 p 10A) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  The Treasury Police have discovered a marijuana plantation

  Guatemalan authorities on 12 March arrested six U.S. 
citizens 
and two Colombians on the Bay of Amatique, on the Atlantic 
Ocean, as they were transporting by barge 499 kg of cocaine 
valued at $8.6 million. The Treasury Police have reported the 
drug was loaded in Panama and was headed for New Orleans. The 
presumed drug traffickers were identified as Colombians Luis 
Javier Montenegro and Melguen Gonzalez, and U.S. citizens Fay 
Walker, Kenneth Robert Villiot, David Anthony Ronquille, 
Mcglohon Westberry, Lyle Arthur Nicholson, and Felix Fenton. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1625 GMT 14 March 94) 
  The Treasury Police have seized $7.7 million worth of 
marijuana paste, plants, and seeds in Alta Gracia, Peten 
Department. Some 120,000 plants were destroyed. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2353 GMT 17 March 94) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has reported three drug 
officers and an alleged drug trafficker were killed in an armed 
confrontation in Sinaloa State. The police officers were 
investigating a marijuana shipment when drug traffickers strafed 
them with machine-gun fire. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0100 GMT 12 
March 94) 
  The Mexican Air Force has reported in coordination with 
federal institutions,"it has obligated drug traffickers to 
reduce the use of airstrips for their illegal activities." The 
report stated Air Force personnel destroyed 56 airstrips in 
1989, 713 in 1990, 766 in 1991, 75 in 1992, and only eight 
during the first months of 1993. The PGR has also reported it 
has "152 airplanes assigned to the identification, detection, 
and fumigation of drug crops" and to the interception of illegal 
planes overflying Mexican territory. It added "the fleet 
completed 41,997 hours of flying time during 1993." (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 14 March 94 p 45) 
  A PGR official spokesman reported today its personnel had 
"seized more than two tons of marijuana and other drugs in 
numerous drug operations" conducted in Baja California Sur, 
Aguascalientes, Coahuila, Guerrero, Jalisco, Nayarit, and 
Queretaro. Authorities also "arrested 27 alleged drug 
traffickers and seized four weapons, seven vehicles, marijuana 
seeds, and 40,000 marijuana plants." Furthermore, Chilpancingo 
Police Chief Blas Escobar Miranda was arrested upon moving 312 
kg of marijuana. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0154 GMT 16 March 94) 
  Raul Campos Rabago, commissioner of the National Institute 
To 
Fight Drugs, said in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, on 16 March 
evidence gathered up to now does not indicate the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army has ties with drug- trafficking groups 
in the country. He said his organization "works in close 
cooperation with the PGR and has seized 160 kg of heroin and 
large quantities of cocaine and marijuana during its first three 
months in operations." Campos Rabago said the institute works 
throughout the country and has 800 specialized officials on the 
job and between 400 and 500 more will enter the organization 
once they are graduated from the PGR Academy. (Mexico City 
UNOMASUNO in Spanish 17 March 94 p 9) 
  PGR personnel have seized 810 kg of cocaine and arrested 
Jose 
Luis Acosta Morales in Las Casitas, Poza Rica Municipality, 
Veracruz State. Acosta Morales has confessed he was attempting 
to take the drug shipment to McAllen, Texas, via the 
Matamoros-Tamaulipas border. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 
18 March 94 p 50) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  According to a report on the achievements and estimates of 
the Attorney General's Office and other authorities which fight 
drug trafficking, 5,589 kg of cocaine were seized and 982 people 
involved in drug trafficking were arrested in 1993. The 
Judicial Technical Police seized the largest amount of cocaine, 
3,036 kg. Police agents also seized large amounts of marijuana, 
cocaine sulfate, crack, heroin, and morphine in 1993. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 15 March 94 p 4A) 
  According to an Attorney General's Office report on drug 
trafficking, at least 1,000 people, 44 percent of whom are 
between 18 and 28 years of age, were arrested in 1993. The 
report also indicates 861 of them were Panamanians, 52 were 
Colombians, 25 were Jamaicans, and 12 were Americans. The 
report also indicates authorities seized some 3.618 million of 
drugs (weight measure unspecified), including 3.569 million of 
cocaine (weight measure unspecified). (Panama City LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 March 94 p C-11) 
  An official source reported on 17 March agents of the 
Technical Customs Investigations Division, Dita, have seized a 
cocaine shipment, worth over $3 million, in Chiriqui Province. 
The drug was distributed in 173 packages. In addition, Dita 
agents also seized 170 kg of cocaine on 15 March in David, 
Chiriqui Province. They also found 13 packages of cocaine 
hidden inside the lavatory of an American Airlines airplane that 
stopped at Tocumen International Airport. (Panama City LA

heels. They later confessed they had swallowed 447 packets of 
cocaine. They were trying to deliver the drug to the island of 
Saint Martin. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug seizures and arrests related to drug trafficking 
monitored through 24 March. 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  Personnel from the Special Antinarcotics Forces, FELCN, and 
the Attorney General's Office arrested 10 people and seized 3 kg 
of cocaine and marijuana during a 48-hour operation in Cobija, 
Trinidad Department. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 6 Mar 94 
National Section p 3) 
  FELCN agents arrested three drug traffickers with 16.3 kg of 
cocaine in La Angostura township, 60 km from Santa Cruz. The 
detainees are Luis Marquez Tucumano, Paulino Lopez Montano, and 
Roberto Perez Rodriguez. They brought the drug from Cochabamba. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 8 Mar 94 p 13) 
  FELCN agents seized 5,000 liters of chemical precursors in 
Quijarro after National Railway Enterprise personnel reported a 
shipment hidden in a van loaded with cement. The drug was bound 
for Santa Cruz. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p 13) 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga Gomez issued a warning 
on the huge improvement in Bolivian drug trafficking technology 
to the extent that large quantities of cocaine hydrochloride are 
being produced in Bolivia. This highly pure substance was only 
processed in clandestine Colombian laboratories until a short 
time ago. According to FELCN files, the drug trafficking gangs 
started to install sophisticated cocaine processing laboratories 
five years ago. National Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said drug 
traffickers are using sophisticated technology and modern 
strategies that can be superior to those of the Mobile Rural 
Patrol Unit, Umopar. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 12 Mar 94 
National Page p 5) 
  Umopar Deputy Commander Juan Melean reported that most coca 
growers "are defending their plantations through the 
self-defense brigades and the installation of explosive devices 
to prevent them from being destroyed." He said Umopar detected 
electric explosive devices along paths and in maceration pits in 
the San Jose, Cotoca, and Entre Rios settlements in Chapare, 
Cochabamba Department. He noted that the characteristics of the 
explosives show that they were manufactured by experts closely 
linked to drug trafficking. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 
13 Mar 94 p A4) 
  FELCN discovered a modern cocaine laboratory at Huarapucu on 
19-20 March. Police destroyed the laboratory, which was capable 
of processing up to 100 kg of cocaine per day, and reportedly 
identified the owners, but no one has been arrested yet. (La Paz 
Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 21 Mar 94) 
  FELCN agents on 20 March discovered a rehabilitation center 
for common criminals that was used by a Bolivian police officer 
as a cocaine factory. Martin Jira used a prison in El Chapare to 
illegally produce the drug. Nearly 100 inmates worked in the 
coca maceration pits built in the compound, where chemicals and 
other elements to process cocaine sulphate base also were found. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 1731 GMT 22 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Amazonas Federal Police Superintendent Mauro Sposito stated 
that drug-sniffing dogs are having difficulties detecting 
cocaine transported inside the pulp of regional fruits, a trick 
commonly used by drug traffickers. This is the case of the 
cupuacu from Amazonas, which is being closely controlled by 
federal agents at airports and ports in Manaus. (Sao Paulo FOLHA 
DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 Mar 94 Section 1 p 2) 
<H5>  Chile </H5>
  The Metropolitan Antinarcotics Brigade arrested seven people 
who were members of two drug trafficking rings that operated in 
Nunoa District and Santiago Centro and in Valparaiso. The 
detainees are Luis Grandon, Jeanette Vardy, Gustavo Ramirez, 
Luigi Inostroza, Marta Rodriguez, Robin del Solar, and Dany del 
Solar. OS-7 Carabineros arrested farmers Ivan Lazaro and Alidio 
Taucare in Arica when they were about to sell 2 kg of cocaine. 
(Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 13 Mar 94 p C7) 
  OS-7 Carabineros from Arica arrested Peruvian Isidora 
Mendoza 
Quispe, 22, when she was about to enter the country with four 
packages containing more than 5 kg of cocaine paste. Carabineros 
also arrested Bolivians Eudosia Huallami Ayavire and Eleuterio

  Investigative Police personnel arrested Pedro Marin, 37, and 
Lilian Encalada, 47, and seized more than 50 kg of cocaine in 
Arica. Also arrested were Walter Castillo, Christian Vergara, 
and Emilia Cortes. OS-7 Carabineros also detained four people 
and seized 5 kg of cocaine paste. The detainees include Lilian 
Choque, Dante Umiet Choque, and Raul Lauca Aica. (Santiago

  More than 6 metric tons of drugs, including cocaine base, 
cocaine hydrochloride, and marijuana, were burned on 23 March in 
the presence of Interior Minister Juan Briones. It is estimated 
that there are approximately 200,000 hectares of coca that 
produce 60 percent of the cocaine base. The minister also 
reported that experimental poppy fields have been spotted in 
Peru. (Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 23 
Mar 94) 
  On 20 March, Peruvian police arrested Margarita Cachique 
Rivera in Lima's San Isidro District. She is a top member of the 
drug trafficking ring known as "Hermanos Cachique Rivera," and 
the owner of the 3,500 kg of cocaine paste seized by security 
forces on 27 February at a clandestine air strip in Madre de 
Dios Department. Her arrest is considered a severe blow to 
Peruvian drug trafficking after the capture of Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka Vaticano. The gang led by Abelardo Cachique 
Rivera took control of the cocaine paste market after the arrest 
of Vaticano and is responsible for the monthly shipment of 1,000 
kg of cocaine paste to Colombia. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0017 GMT

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional narcotics developments monitored through 27 
March. 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  National Drug Control Directorate personnel impounded 0.5 kg 
of high-grade heroin at the Tobias Bolanos Airport on 20 March. 
According to one official, "the drugs were hidden in a broken 
glider and were discovered by a group of children playing in the 
area." (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 22 Mar 94 p 10A) 
  Costa Rican police today reported that Judicial 
Investigation 
Agency personnel have arrested three Colombians, a U.S. citizen, 
and a citizen of the Dominican Republic--all of whom are accused 
of being "members of a heroin-trafficking band." The arrests 
occurred in Alajuela, 20 km north of San Jose. Authorities also 
seized 1.5 kg of high-grade heroin, a large amount of expensive 
jewelry, and about $11,000 in cash. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 1736 GMT 23 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  The Prosecutor's Office has begun legal proceedings against 
five Mexicans--three men and two women--who were arrested on 
drug trafficking charges during searches at the Melendres bridge 
in Tecun Uman, San Marcos. Police found 116 kg of cocaine in 
the Chevrolet Suburban van in which Jose de Jesus Martinez 
Rodriguez and Clara Esther Mecias Medina were traveling on 1 
March. On the following day, police arrested Jesus Acosta Cano, 
Alicia Cano de Acosta, and Erica Murillo Avizu after officers 
discovered 97 kg of cocaine in their vehicle, a similar 
Chevrolet Suburban. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 20 
Mar 94 p 15) 
  Treasury Police reportedly have foiled Cali Cartel plans to 
ship large amounts of cocaine in vehicles to the United States. 
So far this month, police have seized large amounts of drugs 
and impounded land vehicles and water craft "that were to be 
used in the so-called Angel Plan." For example, on 13 March 
police seized 499 kg of cocaine hidden in the Idemar-265 barge 
which was being towed by a U.S.-flagged tugboat. During this 
action they arrested six U.S. citizens and two Colombians. 
  On 18 March at Tecun Uman, San Marcos, police arrested two 
Guatemalan citizens who were travelling in two pickup trucks 
with hidden compartments in which 22 kg of cocaine were hidden. 
Police also arrested Luis Adolfo Mijangos Gonzalez, who was 
transporting 60 kg of cocaine in a GMC pickup truck, in Centro 
Comercial Montufar, Guatemala City. (Guatemala City PRENSA 
LIBRE in Spanish 20 Mar 94 p 2) 
  Treasury Police have reported that more than 800 police are 
guarding several border entry points between Guatemala and 
Mexico to counter any new Cali Cartel action under the so-called 
"Angel Plan." Police said the drug traffickers' plan is designed 
to introduce more than 40 drug-carrying vehicles into the United 
States. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p 167) 
  Treasury Police have reported impounding a marijuana 
plantation with 120,000 marijuana plants and 10.4 kg of 
processed marijuana in an area bordering with Belize. No 
arrests were made. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1512 GMT 21 Mar 
94) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  Federal Judicial Police have arrested two smugglers bringing 
$110,000 in cash into the country--"money that was generated 
from the shipment of 45 kg of cocaine to Houston, Texas." The 
arrests were made at the Cola de Caballo and Santiago-Linares 
highway intersection on 19 March. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign 
Edition) in Spanish 20 Mar 94 p 16B) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  Panamanian Police and Colombian Army authorities have held a 
final meeting to coordinate their efforts in destroying 100 
hectares of coca plants discovered growing in Darien Province 
between 1993 and 1994. Police officials said about 100 
Panamanian and Colombian police will destroy the crops. The 
Panamanians will spray them with insecticide and set fire to 
them and the Colombians will give ground support and secure the 
area. According to officials, coca paste processing 
laboratories have been operating in the area. These labs are 
believed to belong to Colombian drug traffickers. So far, no 
arrests have been made. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 22 
Mar 94 p 2A)

<F P=106> [By Roman Lejtman] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore's blitz visit helped to 
confirm that Alberto Lestelle [programming and coordination 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and the antinarcotics 
struggle], Hugo Anzorreguy [National Intelligence Center, CNI, 
secretary], and [Interior Minister] Carlos Ruckauf will be 
travelling to Washington to meet with Robert Gelbard, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics 
matters. The Argentine officials will assist the Clinton 
administration in drafting the agenda for the so-called Summit 
of the Americas, to be held in Miami at the end of this year, 
which is to be attended by the presidents of the Americas to 
discuss issues pertaining to narcotrafficking, corruption, and 
terrorism, among others. The Argentine proposal, which is still 
being drafted, suggests an overall modification of penal 
regulations to prevent drug cartels from continuing to take 
advantage of legal gaps. 
  According to a communique issued last night by Lestelle's 
office, "at the suggestion of President Menem the antinarcotics 
struggle will be included on the agenda of the Summit of the 
Americas." 
  Menem wants to arrive in Miami with his homework done. He 
will therefore be launching an offensive at the legislative 
level to promulgate a series of laws based on measures that have 
been suggested by the United States. Menem believes that for 
the time being, no new scandals involving the government with 
ill-gotten money will show up. In view of this he has decided 
to take advantage of this situation to push for passage four 
laws that he personally put on hold when the scandals broke 
involving the suitcases belonging to [Menem's sister-in-law] 
Amira [Yoma] and Monzer Al Kassar's citizenship. 
  During his visit to Mar del Plata, where he attended the 
ordinary meeting of the Inter-American Commission for the 
Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD), Gelbard gave his blessings to the 
four draft bills that Lestelle uncovered when he learned that 
Amira would be acquitted before the end of 1994. Three years 
after learning about Yoma's bizarre activities, Lestelle is 
supporting the following initiatives: 
  -- Repentant: It authorizes magistrates to reduce the 
sentences of those drug traffickers who agree to cooperate with 
the courts. The implementation of this legal figure resulted in 
the dismantling of the gang to which Amira Yoma reportedly 
belonged. The government is not worried about Mario Caserta, 
the only one arrested under the Narcogate deal, because it is 
expected that Menem's former friend will be released before the 
approval of the repentant law. 
  -- Informer: It lifts the penalty of those involved who 
supply information on the operations of drug cartels. It is one 
grade lower than repentant. 
  -- Undercover Agent: It allows security force members to 
infiltrate drug cartels under the control of the courts. 
  -- Cargoes Under Court Surveillance: It authorizes the 
continuation of drug operations to detain those responsible in 
the country where the drug is received. 
  Referring to the issues he discussed with Gore during an 
impromptu news conference, Menem said: "We discussed the 
scourges of narcotrafficking and terrorism, and the urgent need 
to undertake joint efforts to combat them." The president did 
not explain to the journalists what these "joint efforts" would 
be, but he did give an indication of the U.S. Government's 
aspirations, which go beyond the bills the Argentine Government 
has promised to promote in Congress. 
  -- "Is there any possibility that the Armed Forces would 
participate in the counternarcotics struggle?" a journalist 
asked. 
  -- "Not for the time being," answered Menem. 
  -- "Why not for the time being?" 
  -- "Because that is the way it is: Not for the time being. 
A politician cannot make predictions. A politician talks about 
facts. I am talking about a fact: Not for the time being."

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion today said the Armed Forces "categorically reject 
the possibility of joining the antinarcotic effort, for which 
they feel neither competent nor inclined." 
  The minister said the Armed Forces' non-engagement in the 
antinarcotics fight is due to the fact that "there are the 
necessary organizations to do it like the Border Police, the 
Argentine Coast Guard, and the Federal Police." 
  "There are countries in which the armed forces have to 
intervene because they do not have those security 
organizations," the minister said. "The Armed Forces 
categorically reject the possibility of joining antinarcotic 
efforts, for which they feel neither competent nor inclined." 
  In this regard, he assured that Argentina "does not have the 
problems of other countries, where drug traffickers make 
themselves the owners of land areas." 
  Concerning U.S. "pressure" for the military to join the 
antinarcotics fight, he said: "It is their problem to 
permanently insist on that fight, just as we insist that they 
should halt drug consumption among their population." 
  On the other hand, Camilion denied press reports that 
President Carlos Menem advocates the engagement of the military 
in domestic intelligence work. 
  The minister said the Armed Forces will only "extend 
logistical support" in case of domestic disturbances, like the 
one that occurred in December in Santiago del Estero, although 
he admitted that government members followed this specific case 
with "concern." 
  Camilion maintained that the government "has no intention" 
of 
making the Armed Forces join domestic intelligence work, adding 
that he received "neither formally nor informally, neither 
directly nor indirectly," any indication in this regard from 
President Menem or Presidency Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. 
  In statements to journalists after opening the academic year 
of the School of National Defense, which is subordinated to his 
portfolio, Camilion recalled that the Armed Forces are ruled by 
defense and internal security laws, and he categorically denied 
that the "amendment" of such laws is being studied. 
  He also categorically denied that the United States has made 
any reference to the possibility of the military taking action 
in case of an eventual social outbreak in Argentina. [passage

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Alberto Lestelle, 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse, denied today that 
the U.S. Government has "imposed decisions or exerted pressure" 
in order that the "repentant" figure be included in Argentine 
legislation on narcotics. He also reiterated that the Armed 
Forces "will have no direct participation" in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. 
  Lestelle explained that the inclusion of the figure 
"repentant" in the legislation had already been foreseen "before 
the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore." 
  Lestelle said that the government sent the bill to Congress 
in 1992, and that in addition to the repentant figure it also 
included the role of the "informer," release on one's own 
recognizance, and the undercover agent. 
  He also denied that the "freezing" of the initiative 
coincided with the alleged link of Amira Yoma, former 
presidential protocol director, to the money laundering case 
known as Narcogate. 
  In this regard Lestelle said: "The question should be asked 
of the members of the Penal and Drug Addiction Committees, who 
never debated the issue." 
  Lestelle added that 30 days ago the government submitted to 
the legislature a bill modifying the previous one, and that 
coordination would be done with the respective committees on the 
possibility of drawing up a single bill so that "it can be 
approved as soon as possible." 
  Regarding the possibility of including the Armed Forces in 
the struggle against drug trafficking, Lestelle said to Radio 
Continental that the government "has decided that they will have 
no direct participation." 
  Lestelle explained, however, that "logically, a security 
organization could ask the Armed Forces for radar support if, 
for example, it is known that an airplane is about to take off 
from a neighboring country." 
  He added: "In any case, once the airplane lands in Argentine 
territory the operation will continue, but will be under the 
jurisdiction of the National Border Police." He confirmed that 
the participation of the Armed Forces in intelligence is 
"absolutely ruled out."

  [Excerpt] Joao Baena Soares, the Brazilian secretary 
general of the OAS, said on 17 March that the possibility of 
armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics effort "had not 
been requested by the United States through the OAS, and the 
idea had only been placed under discussion." 
  Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug 
trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with 
President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18 
March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials. 
  As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics 
effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that 
because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled 
by police." 
  The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue, 
and 
Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to 
reduce demand for drugs." 
  He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and 
rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mar del Plata--While most of 
the drugs seized by the police so far this season were cocaine, 
a new feature in this area was the confiscation of lysergic acid 
[LSD], a substance "not well known" to date in this city, said 
the authorities. 
  LSD, an expensive drug sold in very tiny amounts, "was not 
well known in the region" until this season. It has been seized 
in "private homes of people involved in drug trafficking," said 
the head of Mar del Plata's Drug Traffic Division, 
Superintendent Alejandro Redik. 
  The police officer did not reveal the exact amount of LSD 
that was seized due to "the court proceedings, at the wishes of 
the judge handling the case," he explained. 
  "There was a great deal of antidrug activity in January: 
about 20 arrests, seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and LSD," he 
said. 
  The constant rise in the drug traffic in Argentina has been 
shown by "the 30 percent increase in drug seizures" in relation 
to past years, according to the general superintendent, Horacio 
Hernandez. 
  "Obviously, if there is more traffic it is because demand 
and 
consumption are both up. And if there are more drug seizures, it 
is reasonable to say that there is also increased police 
vigilance," both police officers agreed.

  [Excerpts] An investigation by the Federal Operations 
Division of the Dangerous Drugs Office of the Federal Police led 
to the arrest of five traffickers and the seizure of 20 kilos of 
extremely pure cocaine. The operation culminated with a 
spectacular raid in the heart of the Flores neighborhood 
yesterday evening. 
  The site of these events was Calle Andres Lamas between 
Gaona 
and Franklin, where a large drug transaction was about to take 
place. 
  Forewarned, discreet police surveillance was set up in the 
area, awaiting the right moment to go into action. 
Superintendent Jorge Palacios, director of Federal Operations, 
was in charge. 
<H5>  The Roundup </H5>
  According to the police report, [passage omitted] two Ford 
Fuegos, one red and the other gray, were parked near Franklin. 
[passage omitted] 
  After the traffickers, from whom no weapons were taken, had 
been overpowered, [passage omitted] a long and painstaking 
search was made of the interior of the two Ford Fuegos in which 
the criminals had arrived at the scene. In the red car brown 
nylon bags were found, each containing one kilo of cocaine. 
Twenty kilos were found, all in bags like the ones just 
described. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  A Revealing Detail </H5>
  It was learned there that one of the two occupants of the 
red 
car in which the drugs were found is a Bolivian citizen, who had 
earlier been sentenced in Argentina to 12 and 1/2 years in 
prison. For reasons still unknown, he was released after serving 
only one and a half years of his court-imposed sentence.

<F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>
  [Text] The brief visit [by U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore]--like all visits by U.S. personalities, who never have 
enough time for a small country like ours, or even for countries 
like Argentina and Brazil, for which there are but a couple of 
hours in the middle of a huge show--has left us some lessons. 
  The U.S. Vice President--in this regard we agree with some 
of 
the viewpoints that were raised by the press today--probably 
gave us two messages. On the one hand, the U.S. position on the 
antinarcotics fight has not budged an inch. There have been 
neither essential nor substantive changes between the Bush and 
Clinton administrations. 
  The U.S. ambassador soon realized that the coca leaf garland 
[given to Gore upon getting off the plane] was a hot issue, and 
asked the vice president to get rid of it. Gore wore it for 
barely a few seconds. This clearly shows the U.S. position. 
Drug trafficking, coca, and production remain vital and 
essential and, unfortunately, decisive factors in bilateral 
relations. 
  Yet a second, positive message, in which we may find the 
most 
important point of this visit, is that sustainable development, 
the environment, and the preservation of ecological balance in a 
region that is so important as the Amazonas, is of the utmost 
importance for the United States, and especially for the U.S. 
vice president. 
  In Santa Cruz, Gore ratified his support for the 
construction 
of a gas pipeline to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for conveying clean 
energy for that very important Latin American city. He also 
supported a set of projects that could become an option. 
  I do not know whether the development of ecology, or rather 
I 
should say the preservation of the environment, will become as 
important as the coca issue. I don't believe so. Yet it is a 
point on the agenda that can produce some changes, or give a 
different touch to this dreadful and conditioned relation that 
coca has produced between Bolivia and the United States.

  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore removed a coca leaf 
necklace that had been placed in homage around his neck upon his 
arrival at the airport in La Paz, capital of Bolivia. The 
incident was interpreted by Bolivian radio as an inadmissable 
snub, a grave insult to Bolivia, because the coca leaf is 
considered an element of the national culture. 
  The U.S. vice president's attitude is due to Washington's 
position that the origin of the drug-addiction problem affecting 
U.S. society lies in the existence of the coca leaf. 
  The coca leaf has been consumed for centuries for beneficial 
purposes, but now the U.S. is trying to bring about the total 
elimination of the plant.

  [Excerpt] On 1 March, the government made an energetic 
defense of the traditional use of coca leaf, and it rejected the 
proposal by the UN International Drug Control Board (JIFE) that 
Bolivia and Peru should declare illegal the cultivation and use 
of coca leaf in all its forms. 
  Through an official document, the Foreign Ministry reminded 
JIFE that Bolivia "acknowledges as legal the traditional use" of 
coca leaf. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas stated that 
"Bolivia is a sovereign country," where there is a law that 
differentiates between the legal and illegal use of coca leaf. 
  "I believe that Bolivia demands respect for its laws and 
sovereignty. Coca leaf will continue to exist because a large 
part of the country uses it for medicinal, healing, and 
cultural rituals," Cardenas said. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Arinibar reported that the case of 
excessive coca leaf production has caused a conflictive 
situation due to the process of the change in governments. 
  "The basis of the government's policy is that of voluntary 
eradication in coordination with a responsive and joint effort 
with the producers," he said. 
  Regarding the eradication of coca and the latest incidents 
in 
Chapare, Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade 
Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, stated that 
this sector wants to live in peace, not under a regime of 
violence. "But the government causes violence by forcefully 
eradicating coca plantations that are the only economic support 
for the workers in Cochabamba's tropical region," he said.

  [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies Vice President Alfonso 
Ferrufino said yesterday that the use of violence as a method to 
fight the illegal drug trade has failed and now the United 
States must leave Bolivia alone to design its own antinarcotics 
strategy. 
  In the midst of growing tension in coca producing areas, 
legislators have again questioned official antinarcotics 
policies which emphasize repression as the main tool to fight 
trafficking. This is being blamed for the tension in Chapare. 
  "The results speak for themselves. The volumes of drugs 
introduced into the United States have increased and consumption 
has expanded during the years these policies have been in 
effect. This reality has forced Bill Clinton's administration 
to conclude that the drug problem in their country is a problem 
of education and health," Ferrufino said. 
  The legislator recognized that surplus coca plantations are 
linked to poverty and unemployment. The peasants have seen in 
that crop their only possibility for survival at a time of 
growing unemployment. 
  "If the United Nations understood and accepted the U.S. 
installation of radars to control the entry of drugs in its 
territory, why would the United States not accept that Bolivia 
wants to seek its own solution to the problem instead of 
continuing to implement a failure," Ferrufino said. [passage

  [Excerpt] Following the discovery and destruction of the 
largest drug laboratory yet found in eastern Bolivia, the 
government has confirmed the existence of facilities to process 
cocaine sulfate into cocaine hydrochloride in Bolivia. 
  Operation "Aguardiente" was carried out by personnel of the 
Special Antinarcotics Force in Eastern Bolivia last weekend, 
with the support of the DEA. This led to the discovery of a 
laboratory where the drug was transformed into highly pure 
cocaine--which had not been previously observed in Bolivia. 
  Cocaine sulfate or cocaine base paste is normally shipped 
undried to Colombia where it is refined. 
  National Defense Secretary Mario Soliz and Prosecutor 
Fernando Ugarte held a news conference at which they confirmed 
that the 18 individuals arrested, four of whom are Colombians, 
worked directly with the Cali Cartel of Colombia. 
  One of the arrested individuals said the head of the cartel 
is Pacho Herrera, currently sought internationally by antidrug 
forces. 
  The laboratory was equipped with weapons, radio equipment, 
and everything needed to manufacture cocaine. The police even 
found a pump to bring water from the river to the camp, fans to 
dry the drugs, and a hydraulic press to pack the cocaine prior 
to shipping. 
  The drug was transported to Colombia, via Brazil, from where 
it was shipped to several parts of Europe, especially The 
Netherlands. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Espinosa] </F>
  [Excerpts] The report and conclusions handed down by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, to the Constitution 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies contain very serious 
charges. Although the report exempts former President Jaime Paz 
Zamora from any link to drug trafficking, it clearly indicates 
that Paz Zamora's closest assistants--including Susana Seleme 
and Oscar Eid Franco--have been linked to drug trafficking or 
have concealed this sort of crime. The report, which the FELCN 
handed to the congressional commission at 2300 last night, also 
contains a series of other names. 
  The report clearly establishes that there is evidence that 
Oscar Eid Franco, current Movement of the Revolutionary Left 
(MIR) president; former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco; 
Susana Seleme, former government palace private secretary; 
former Santa Cruz Mayor Rolando Arostegui; Carlos Valverde, 
former Santa Cruz Department intelligence chief; and other less 
important MIR leaders have been linked to drug trafficking. 
[passage omitted] 
  More than 10 MIR leaders are being charged with involvement 
in drug trafficking. The FELCN establishes three groups of 
allegedly guilty people. The first group is charged with links 
to a drug trafficking gang responsible for processing, selling, 
and trafficking in cocaine. In the second group are Oscar Eid, 
Susana Seleme, Carlos Valverde, and other MIR members who are 
charged with alleged dubious scheming and unlawful association 
with Chavarria. It is also said that they concealed drug 
trafficking crimes. The third group includes Guillermo 
Capobianco and Rolando Arostegui, MIR leaders who have had 
special privileges. In this regard the Constitution Commission 
members have stated that although they committed the same crimes 
as the aforementioned people, the crimes will be studied by a 
congressional commission. 
  Jaime Paz Zamora was not mentioned in this report sent to 
the 
Constitution Commission. [passage omitted] 
  The FELCN is also pressing charges against the Colombian 
Guido Arce; Elmer Saucedo, former national chief of the 
department of goods seized from drug traffickers; Army Colonel 
Jorge Velazquez, who was former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
aide-de-camp and head of the aides-de-camp; and Fernando 
Canelas; in addition to Susana Seleme; Oscar Eid; Carlos 
Valverde; Guillermo Capobianco; and former Mayor Arostegui. All 
of them are MIR leaders or people closely related to the 
previous administration. We repeat that these people have all 
been mentioned in the report handed by the FELCN to the 
Constitution Commission. [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora and his party, the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR), protected Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, who 
is considered Bolivia's top drug trafficker, and allowed him to 
intervene in the government, according to a police report 
submitted to Congress. 
  The main MIR leaders today said the Special Antinarcotics 
Force (FELCN) report is "a conspiracy" to destroy the party and 
the possibilities of Paz Zamora's presidential candidacy in 1997. 
  Paz Zamora ended his isolation at his ranch in El Picacho in 
the city of Tarija, in southern Bolivia, and arrived in La Paz 
on 24 March to meet MIR leaders. 
  The FELCN report includes a list of chronologically arranged 
events from 1978 to 1994 that proves the relations and meetings 
the MIR leadership held with Chavarria and another group of drug 
traffickers, in some cases for delivering money, and in others 
for analyzing "how President Paz Zamora could help them." 
  Some 10 traffickers agreed to surrender under the so-called 
"repentance decree," with which the government guaranteed that 
they would not be extradited to the United States, and are now 
jailed in Bolivian prisons. 
  The FELCN report, which the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitutional Committee has evaluated since 23 March, surprised 
several circles because of the magnitude of the network that 
operated within the Patriotic Accord government, which was 
headed by Paz Zamora. 
  Isaac "Oso" Chavarria, who was arrested by the FELCN on 25 
January, "used the methods of an `intelligence' agent to foment 
`narco-influence' [narcoinfluencia] within the `leadership' 
(executive board) of the MIR," the report says, adding that 
Chavarria used his training as a former Bolivian Army captain. 
  The report adds that "Chavarria turned the fear of MIR 
leaders into an instrument for blackmail," forcing them to 
commit illegal actions to protect him "from FELCN efforts" to 
capture him. 
  Paz Zamora's sisters Rosario and Edith, and his private 
secretary Susana Seleme, along with acting MIR leader Oscar Eid, 
and Lieutenant Colonel Jorge "Coco" Velasquez--the government 
house security chief, are mentioned in the report as the 
"liaisons" between the president and Chavarria. 
  The FELCN report says Chavarria tried to influence Paz 
Zamora--through aide-de-camp Velasquez--for the designation of 
high-ranking officers. The report mentioned the designation of 
Colonel Faustino Rico Toro as FELCN chief as one of the examples 
that reflected the alleged trafficker's intention to create a 
"narcostructure" [narcoestructura]. 
  Rico Toro, who was arrested in Cochabamba on 22 March and 
arrived on 24 March in La Paz, has been--according to 
FELCN--Chavarria's partner for 11 years. In 1983 he bought an 
apartment Rico Toro owned in Biscayne Bay, Florida, southeastern 
United States, and a house in the La Paz residential 
neighborhood of Irpavi. 
  In February 1991, Edith Paz Zamora and Lt. Col. Velasquez 
"arranged a meeting between Chavarria and the president at 
Edith's house in Obrajes (a residential La Paz neighborhood) to 
discuss possible replacements within FELCN, including the 
designation of Col. Rico Toro as commander," FELCN states in its 
report, which is attached to five case folders on the event. 
  The Constitutional Committee has asked FELCN to suspend all 
actions against MIR leaders until the conclusion of the 
congressional investigation.

  [Text] Colonel Faustino Rico Toro was arrested by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] in Cochabamba last night. 
Rico Toro was one of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza's close 
assistants. But he was not tried with the former dictator. 
  He was appointed FELCN commander during Jaime Paz Zamora's 
government, although he had to resign a few hours later after 
observations made by the U.S. Embassy, which had suspicions of 
Rico Toro's links to drug traffickers. 
  His arrest occurred between 2100 and 2300 last night. He is 
being detained at a FELCN jail in Cochabamba. There is evidence 
against him. He is being questioned, FELCN Deputy Commander 
General Rogelio Vargas said. 
  Vargas added that he did not know whether Rico Toro will be 
transferred to La Paz. This is something that must be decided by 
prosecutors, he said. In another 48 hours we will know if the 
Cochabamba prosecutor's office will bring charges of drug 
trafficking against Faustino Rico Toro. If so, he will spend a 
few years in prison.

  [Text] Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
condemned the acts of violence in Chapare on 25 February as a 
result of a clash between coca growers and anti-drug forces and 
declared that he was against the eradication by force of surplus 
coca plantations. 
  "We all lose if the dialogue is interrupted; peaceful 
measures must be sought," said Cardenas in pointing out that the 
eradication of surplus coca plantations should be based on an 
agreement with the producers and their grass-roots 
organizations. Cardenas added: "Forceful eradication means 
violence and we reject it." 
  According to some coca growers' leaders, the clash that 
resulted in several injuries was prompted by a government 
decision to forcefully eradicate surplus coca plantations. The 
government has stated that the plantations eradicated during the 
past few months were located near drug laboratories and the 
eradication is being done according to the law. 
  Government Minister German Quiroga asserted that the clash 
was prompted by the peasants' decision to occupy by force the 
Coca Eradication Directorate (Direco), instigated by drug 
traffickers. 
  Cardenas declined commenting on what happened in Chapare. He 
said he did not have precise information but noted that if 
abuses were perpetrated, Congress will demand an explanation 
from the executive branch. 
  He said that although there are laws that provide for the 
eradication of surplus plantations, it should be carried out by 
mutual agreement. 
  Cardenas warned that the recent clashes will strain even 
more 
the tense relationship between coca growers organizations and 
the organizations in charge of controlling coca production. 
  Law No. 1008 on coca and controlled substances classifies 
Chapare as a transitional region in which the coca plantations 
must be eradicated by common agreement with prior payment of 
$2,000 per hectares to the growers. Moreover, the law requires 
that the government carry out programs for alternative crops to 
avoid any traumatic consequences. 
  However, over the past two years the eradication program has 
not developed according to schedule and the benefits of the 
alternative crops are not visible, which has been very 
frustrating for the peasants, thus causing clashes between 
producers and interdiction forces on several occasions.

  [Text] The Coca Reduction Directorate, Direco, will 
continue coca farm reduction plans in the tropical zone despite 
the peasants' mobilization in the region, a reliable Direco 
source reported. The source justified the actions by one of the 
brigades that on 26 February destroyed approximately 2.5 
hectares of coca farms in San Pablo colony. 
  He said there is no reason for either suspending or 
interfering with the development of reduction plans. 
  The forceful eradication of coca farms began on 28 February, 
during carnival celebrations, and less than five hectares of 
illegal coca farms have been destroyed since then. 
  Despite the small area of eradicated coca farms, its 
connotations did have repercussions because of the violent 
procedure and the clashes between coca growers and police who 
protected the eradication brigades. 
  The Direco source said that in all the cases in which coca 
farms were forcefully eradicated, the farms were affected by the 
interdiction work because they had maceration pits, and this 
makes them illegal. 
  Said the source: "In the three cases, we did as established 
by Article 71 of Law No. 1008, that is, the farms were destroyed 
without any compensation. The law authorizes transfer of the 
land to state ownership, but this has not been done yet." 
  The new coca eradication brigades are made up of some 400 
officials, most of them antinarcotics policemen who provide 
security and coverage, while Direco officials contract personnel 
for the destruction of farms. 
  In addition to compulsory eradication, voluntary eradication 
after payment of $2,000 per hectare is still in force. 
  The source added: "Many peasants have registered on the 
Direco lists for eradication of their coca farms, asking for the 
corresponding compensation." 
  He said that during the 26 February incidents, no Direco 
personnel were injured or mistreated, but there was a big shock.

  [Text] On 8 March, Government Minister German Quiroga 
rejected the position adopted by coca producer leaders, who 
demand the suspension of antidrug operations in Chapare to 
eradicate the coca plantations prior to the long-awaited 
negotiations. 
  Explaining the recent confrontations in Chapare between coca 
producers and antidrug forces to the Senate Antinarcotic 
Struggle Committee, the minister flatly maintained that actions 
by the Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas (Umopar) in the 
tropical region seek to control traffickers, not coca producers. 
  Quiroga stated that the actions in Chapare will continue 
despite opposition by coca producers. 
  Regarding demands by coca producers leaders to sit down and 
talk with the government, Quiroga said he agreed to suspend the 
forced eradication of coca because "at this time no leader is 
under arrest." 
  "Wherever we find a maceration pit or a cocaine laboratory 
we 
will destroy it," he said. 
  He indicated that the government is awaiting a call from the 
Bolivian Labor Federation, which is mediating in the 
negotiations, to proceed with a meeting between the coca 
producers and government that is scheduled for today. 
  He stated that the government wants to reach agreement with 
the producers, without implying any loss for the campesinos, and 
wants to stop the supply of precursors to the traffickers. 
  He noted that the results of the fight against trafficking 
is 
reflected in the price paid for a drum of coca leaf: On 1 
February 1994 a drum cost 270 bolivianos, today it costs just 90 
bolivianos.

  [Text] The government and coca farmers failed yesterday to 
reach an agreement that will pacify the coca producing zones in 
El Chapare region of Cochabamba Department. 
  Following long meetings, the peasant leaders decided to 
withdraw from talks with the cabinet members. They said the 
ministers broke the preliminary agreement reached on 9 March. 
  The article that caused the breaking of relations sought to 
make the coca leaders promise to engage in voluntary eradication 
of plantations "without interference" from the peasants. 
  Until dawn on 10 March, considerable progress was made 
toward 
overcoming the atmosphere of violence that prevailed since 5 
March when officials from the Coca Eradication Directorate 
(Direco) and members of the Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas 
clashed with 4,000 coca farmers in the Chapare. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of the 
Government German Quiroga, as well as coca peasant leader Evo 
Morales and COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] leader Oscar Salas, 
said yesterday that there are implicit threats to use violence 
again in the tropical Chapare region. 
  Government and union leaders blamed each other for breaking 
the agreement, which the public considered a positive step 
toward an atmosphere of peace in the agitated central region of 
Bolivia. 
  "The government will ensure that the law is respected," 
Minister Quiroga told journalists after meeting with President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada. 
  Minister Aranibar expressed "the government's disenchantment 
and frustration at the result of the conversations." He said 
the issue "was handled with full respect for the political will 
to resolve the problems within an atmosphere dialogue, 
understanding, and the spirit of Law No. 1008." He said the 
opposition of some coca leaders to the control of excess coca 
crops is just as unacceptable as when organizations like the 
JIFE [International Council of Narcotics Control] suggest a ban 
on the consumption of coca leaves.

  [Text] Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz admitted on 28 
February that about 60 peasants who were growing coca were 
detained in the 26 February clashes and subsequently released. 
The peasants are under investigation by the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) over their alleged ties to drug 
trafficking. 
  Soliz said the measure was taken after the intelligence 
services determined that the peasant mobilization was headed "by 
agitators," allegedly trained by drug traffickers who intend to 
create problems for the executive branch authorities. 
  Soliz noted: "Yes, there obviously exists some type of link. 
Records (of the detainees) have been prepared and the 
intelligence services will surely determine who these people 
are. If they have any ties to drug trafficking, these people 
will be called to testify at FELCN." 
  He said the infiltration of drug traffickers in the 
assemblies and meetings of coca growers aims to prevent the 
growers from understanding the alternative development program's 
benefits for Chapare's peasant communities. 
  He expressed optimism, however, that the interrupted 
negotiations with coca growers will be resumed on 3 March. Soliz 
added: "We understand they will attend the meeting, and in this 
regard we want to use all our ability for dialogue to see if 
they are sincere in resuming the dialogue and fulfilling the 
law." 
  He said the task of eradicating illegal coca in Chapare will 
continue in accordance with the plans of national officials and 
in strict compliance with the law. He announced that the Social 
Defense National Secretariat installed a permanent office in 
that region with experts and under secretaries who will contact 
the real producers at least five days each month to promote 
alternative projects. 
  Soliz also reported that several coca growers' leaders are 
constantly threatening the peasants who want to join the coca 
replacement plan, and this clearly shows the political handling 
of the coca problem.

  [Text] After the tense atmosphere that prevailed last 
weekend, calm returned to Chapare today after the government's 
decision to release 62 people arrested during the violent clash 
between coca leaf growers and antidrug forces on 25 February. 
This information was disclosed by Cochabamba Mayor German Lema 
Araoz. 
  As he announced the release of the arrested people, Minister 
of Government German Quiroga, who applauded the fact that 
"fortunately no significant casualties" were registered, warned 
that the peasants will not be allowed to cause new disturbances. 
  In addition to Quiroga's warning were those made by Social 
Defense Secretary Mario Soliz, who admitted shortly afterward 
that the peasants who were released are being investigated by 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) to determine possible 
links to drug traffickers. 
  Soliz asserted that the plan to eradicate illegal coca 
plantations will continue as scheduled in the Chapare area. 
  The coca growers, in turn, accepted the government's 
invitation to a peaceful dialogue as of 2 March in La Paz, but 
warned that the eradication of coca plantations will not be 
discussed because, first of all, they have to discuss their 
proposals to fight drug trafficking and coca leaf production. 
  Evo Morales, executive secretary of the Special Federation 
of 
Peasant Workers of the Tropics, asserted: "We are not going to 
accept compulsory eradication." Morales warned that in view of 
the "offensive" by antidrug forces, "we have no other 
alternative but to strengthen our self-defense committees, the 
peasant defense patrols, and, in some cases, the security 
committees." 
  The General Trade Union of Bolivian Peasant Workers (CSUTCB) 
also voiced support for the coca growers' demands through leader 
Felix Santos, who pointed out the need to tackle this problem in 
a comprehensive manner because "partial" solutions do not have 
positive results. 
  Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas condemned the 
violence in Chapare and said he was against eradication by force 
of surplus coca plantations. 
  Cardenas said: "Forced eradication only means violence, 
which we reject," and suggested that the reduction of surplus 
plantations be carried out based on agreements with the 
producers and their grass-roots organizations.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Mar (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The U.S. agents who 
work for the DEA and some Bolivian police officers are working 
in coordination with drug trafficking groups that operate in the 
country "to extort small drug traffickers and cocaine growers," 
according to retired Captain Jaime Paredes Sempertegui. 
  Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago, 
became publicly known for his charges of corruption in the Navy 
when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections 
between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed 
that "the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and 
Bolivian laws." 
  "I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it" said Paredes 
Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is 
currently an adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense 
Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen 
carry out "their well-known extortion operations." 
  He said the criminal acts "are made in the so-called 
security 
houses located all over the national territory. These acts are 
known by the public. For example, in Santa Cruz I would like to 
point out the house of a Bolivian Navy member rented for that 
purpose. It is the house of Colonel Alberto Latelier Ortiz." 
  Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people 
and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for 
which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the 
Armed Forces and National Police primarily. 
  He said the investigation announced on this case by 
legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and 
will clarify the real operation of the "security houses," which 
are completely outside the country's legal order.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The United Nations estimates that 
between 70 and 80 percent of the chemical substances used in 
processing cocaine in Peru and Bolivia are either manufactured 
in or shipped through Brazil. The statement was made yesterday 
by Herbert Schaepe, secretary of the UN International Board on 
Narcotic Drugs [Junta Internacional de Estupefacientes da ONU]. 
  Schaepe requested that Brazilian Justice Minister Mauricio 
Correa report on Brazilian compliance with three agreements on 
the control of drug production and use. 
  Noncompliance with these international agreements will make 
it difficult for Brazil to obtain resources to fight the drug 
trade. According to Schaepe, the opinion of the Board is 
important for the disbursement of these funds. 
  The Board--which is headquartered in Vienna, 
Austria--consists of 13 member countries, which will evaluate 
the Brazilian Government's reports. 
  The United Nations is concerned about Brazil having become a 
route for cocaine substances, as well as about the consumption 
in the country of 80 percent of the world production of 
Fenproporex, a basic appetite suppressant that causes physical 
and psychological dependence. 
  Fenproporex is an anorectic amphetamine that is used in 
Brazil, namely by drug stores filling up prescriptions issued by 
"obesity doctors" to patients who are seeking to lose weight. 
  In addition to dependence, Fenproporex causes irritability, 
depression, and increases the heartbeat. This drug is more 
dangerous when it is used with other pain relievers. 
  According to the United Nations, the Brazilian Government is 
not informing the Board about controls adopted in these two 
cases. 
  Justice Minister Correa said that the reports requested by 
the United Nations will be filed in the next few days. He noted 
that during the Collor administration the Health Ministry 
discontinued its controls over use of legal drugs such as 
appetite suppressants. He said the Brazilian Government is 
willing to comply with all of its agreements.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The current wave of kidnappings 
and bullion holdups has demonstrated to police the new 
guidelines of the two main organized crime branches in Rio de 
Janeiro State. According to Helio Vigio, chief of the DAS 
[Counter-Kidnapping Headquarters], the main drug traffickers 
from the Red Command and Third Command gangs have established 
illegal enterprises to supply men and weapons and plan the 
collection of ransom, and they even have experts to negotiate 
with the kidnapped victims' families. 
  According to police, Flavio Negao, from the Vigario Geral 
slum, and Orlando Jogador, from the Alemao and Marcelo Xara 
slums on Varginha Hill, besides being drug traffickers also 
kidnapped people and robbed bullion in the past four months. 
"The news now is that smaller gangs are kidnapping minor 
businessmen to raise money to buy drugs," said Inspector 
Placidio Guimaraes, DAS operations chief. 
  Other gangs, like that of drug trafficker Robertinho from 
Parada de Lucas slum, which is linked to the Third Command, rent 
sophisticated weapons for kidnapping and bullion robbery 
operations. They also provide men for operations in exchange for 
a percentage of the ransom. Joel de Oliveira Carvalho says he is 
"an expert in negotiating with the victims' families" and also 
provides other services to kidnappers. 
  Vigio says drug traffickers usually buy drugs in return. "If 
police discover one of their drug caches, they need to find 
money quickly to buy more drugs and not lose their supplier," he 
said. 
  According to DAS, there currently are seven kidnapped people 
in Rio de Janeiro.

  [Text] Vicenzo Buondonno, a 37-year-old Italian and member 
of the Mafia, was arrested on 15 March by agents from the 
Maritime, Air, and Border Police Precinct (DP-MAF) of the 
Federal Police. The warrant for his arrest was issued by the 
Federal Supreme Court at the request of the Italian Government, 
which has filed for his extradition. Buondonno, who is linked 
to the Camorra of Naples, was in charge of receiving drugs from 
other South American countries and shipping them to Europe as 
part of the so-called "Spaghetti Connection." 
  Buondonno, known as Enzo, is the son of Rosario Buondonno, 
one of the leading members of the Camorra. Edson Antonio de 
Oliveira, Federal Police director for Rio de Janeiro, reported 
that Buondonno had been spotted in Rio de Janeiro four months 
ago. He was subsequently kept under surveillance by the police 
until the warrant for his arrest was issued. 
  The mafioso was arrested when he was going to his apartment 
on 26 Barata Ribeiro Street, in the Copacabana district. The 
three Italians who accompanied him were released after being 
questioned by the Federal Police. Buondonno is one of the 
owners of the Baroni-Fasoli Restaurant located on Jangadeiros 
Street, in the Ipanema district. De Oliveira stated that 
Italian Mafia members "launder" drug money through their chains 
of restaurants--hence the name "Spaghetti Connection." 
  The Federal Police also discovered that Buondonno has links 
with at least two other Italian Mafia members--Humberto Amaturo, 
who escaped from the Brasilia Federal Police but was recaptured 
in Bolivia, and Marco Pugliese from the Sacra Corona Unita, who 
was taken into custody in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Because of the friendship between Buondonno and Pugliese the 
police are investigating the possibility of Italian Mafia groups 
having joined forces to facilitate drug trafficking. Buondonno 
may have something to do with the murder of Roberto Farina, one 
of the owners of the jewelry shop at the Copacabana Palace 
Hotel, who was killed in 1991.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks recorded] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview with the "TV Today" 
newscast, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has affirmed his 
determination to punish drug traffickers. He stressed the need 
for U.S. cooperation in this task with whatever evidence it may 
have, and he denounced a discredit campaign which seems to be 
underway. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this is a mistake, because if they 
really want us to put criminals in jail, they must help us with 
evidence; it would be absurd not to do so. In addition, they 
cannot expect us to throw people in jail without evidence. What 
we need is evidence, and that is the whole purpose of 
international cooperation." 
  Regarding the Cali Cartel drug traffickers, the prosecutor 
general added the Prosecutor General's Office has some evidence 
against them. 
  [De Greiff] "We have some evidence against them, but the 
more 
evidence we have the better." 
  De Greiff said the Prosecutor General's Office has the 
desire 
and determination to punish drug traffickers firmly. 
  [De Greiff] "What happens is that naturally, when the 
government demands and states drug traffickers be severely 
punished, it is implying there is someone who does not want to 
punish them, who might be me. This perception is absolutely 
wrong." 
  De Greiff added there is a campaign underway to discredit 
him. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this campaign is being handled 
erroneously. It is a very disloyal campaign that I think is 
affecting Colombia's image." 
  Despite everything, the prosecutor general affirmed his 
determination to fight crime. 
  [De Greiff] "My aim is to fight drug trafficking in all 
forms 
and to open the door to those who want to surrender to justice 
within the legal framework promulgated by the government." 
  Finally, de Greiff said he is expecting to receive an 
official communication from the U.S. State Department on 
judicial aid to Colombia.

  [Text] There are more statements by Prosecutor General de 
Greiff, who was unruffled by the U.S. announcement of a possible 
suspension of judicial cooperation with Colombia. 
  Although the Governments of the United States and Colombia 
have not made official the suspension of aid or the exchange of 
judicial evidence, the prosecutor general noted that if the 
warning is carried out his office will continue to try the 
narcotraffickers with the evidence that it gathers. 
  [Begin recording] [De Greiff] Nobody benefits. Nobody 
benefits from a lack of evidence exchange or a lack of 
cooperation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Who stands to lose the most or what 
happens? 
  [De Greiff] I believe that the United States stands to lose 
the most. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, who do you think is--let us speak 
honestly--trying to trip you up? 
  [De Greiff] Ask the government. 
  [Reporter] Do you think it is necessary to reform the law on 
criminal proceedings again? 
  [De Greiff] I think that no foreign country has the right to 
indicate to another one how to dictate its laws. That is the 
mission of the legislators. [end recording] 
  [Earlier in this same "24 Hours Newscast" Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 23 
March also carries a three-minute report on press agency reports 
that the United States may suspend judicial cooperation with 
Colombia and U.S. State Department sources claiming there is 
very little behind these rumors. Colombian Embassy sources said 
that future cooperation is being assessed and "whether material 
would be given to the office of Prosecutor General de Greiff in 
the future." In a recording, when asked about this issue 
Colombian Foreign Minister Neomi Sanin said: "Colombia has a 
sovereign and independent policy. It has its own foreign policy 
that is respected by all countries of the hemisphere."]

  [Text] The Colombian Embassy in Washington and the Justice 
Ministry stated yesterday that they had no knowledge of the 
alleged decision by the U.S. State Department to suspend 
judicial cooperation and evidence exchange with Colombia until 
the scope of the Procedure Code is explained. 
  Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador in Washington, was 
puzzled by dispatches to that effect datelined in Washington by 
the news agencies AFP and AP, which attributed the information 
to the State Department. Silva indicated that no communication 
in that regard has taken place and added that, to the contrary, 
work is being conducted to agree on criteria on the matter of 
cooperation, "because whenever difficulties have arisen the aid 
has not been suspended." Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said 
that "the government has no information to that effect neither 
in Bogota nor in Washington." 
  Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta and Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff made similar comments. After several 
consultations with officials in Colombia and the United States, 
they dismissed the reports. The attorney general said that 
important meetings are being held with U.S. officials to resolve 
the problems that may have arisen regarding the policy of 
surrendering to justice. 
  "There are differing views and interpretations regarding the 
policy of surrendering to justice and reducing sentences, but 
the U.S. Government has not formally made a decision," Silva 
said. According to Ambassador Silva, Colombian and U.S. 
officials have been discussing for some time judicial 
cooperation and how to resolve a series of obstacles that have 
arisen. "Cooperation is a two-way street," Silva noted, "and to 
cooperate we must be in agreement, and that is where we stand." 
Justice Minister Gonzalez said the government has not received 
any kind of official communication on the alleged suspension of 
judicial exchange with the United States. "Although we have had 
differences, it has not led to a break in cooperation, and, 
quite the opposite, we hope to foster a climate to reinforce 
that cooperation because it is indispensable to combating drug 
trafficking for the sake of Colombia and mankind," Gonzalez 
added. 
  The differences between U.S. authorities and the Office of 
the Prosecutor General revolve around what the United States 
views as confusing guidelines within the Penal Procedure Code on 
the matter of sentence reductions. On this matter, the justice 
minister flatly denied that said code contains any benefit or 
automatic reduction of sentences to criminials who surrender or 
provide information to the Justice Ministry but rather gives the 
Office of the Prosecutor General discretionary power to grant 
some benefits provided the cooperation with justice is 
effective. "Surrendering alone does not entail a sentence 
reduction since effective cooperation with justice is 
indispensable," Gonzalez explained. This official, along with 
the Office of the Deputy Prosecutor General, promoted the code 
reform in Congress.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F>
Gustavo Arrieta by Dario Arizmendi--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] Will you fly to the United States 
(in the next few hours) as was reported in a television newscast 
last night? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] there would not be any doubt. 
For the time being, however, I have no plans to travel. 
  [Arizmendi] What does the Attorney General's Office know 
about the reported plans of three U.S. senators to present in 
the Senate a proposal requesting the removal or resignation of 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information. To tell you the truth, I do 
not think the U.S. Congress will embark on such a venture. 
  [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General, can you expand 
on that? 
  [Arrieta] I have no information on any Congress statement to 
that effect. I repeat: I do not think the U.S. Congress will 
embark on such a venture. Anyway, the Congress would be wrong 
to request the resignation of an independent official appointed 
by another administration and whose term in office is fixed. 
There has been some disagreement between the Colombian 
Government and U.S. authorities over [words indistinct]. 
Senator Kerry has made some remarks in the Senate, but I do not 
think the point has been or will be reached where the 
resignation of a Colombian official is requested. That's 
ridiculous. 
  [Arizmendi] Has the Colombian Justice Ministry, President 
Cesar Gaviria, or the Prosecutor General asked you to travel to 
the United States to discuss this subject so you can present 
your arguments regarding the independence of government branches 
in our country? 
  [Arrieta] I have been in permanent communication with the 
prosecutor general and President Gaviria on this subject. We 
have been making every effort and are using every reasonable 
mechanism to solve this impasse. I have a feeling that we are 
beginning to make some headway. Should it be necessary to 
travel, I will do it gladly. I have discussed this possibility 
with de Greiff, the U.S. ambassador, and President Gaviria. The 
idea would be for me to act as a spokesman to explain certain 
aspects of the administration of justice inherent to the 
obedience to authorities and the division of government 
branches. We would try to clarify certain past 
misunderstandings about this subject. 
  [Arizmendi] Was any aspect of the subject clarified during 
your conversation with the U.S. ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota? 
  [Arrieta] That is what we have been trying to do. We want to 
make a decision. Some progress has been made and some solutions 
found. I hope we will be able to make progress and establish 
some type of harmonious and cordial working relationship after 
some time. I cannot guarantee that it will happen, but that is 
what we are trying to do. 
  [Arizmendi] Has de Greiff been affected by this public 
controversy and the opposition in the United States to his 
position? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] the situation is regrettable. 
As 
the result of what I have been discussing with de Greiff, the 
most important aspect of all this process--which I would like to 
leave behind, Dario--is that we are beginning to reach points of 
agreement that will make it possible for us to progress. As I 
have said for some time, Dario, this is too complex a problem 
for Colombia. A confrontation that is simultaneously local, 
interinstitutional, and international with the United States 
would be (undesirable). I think all involved parties agree on 
the need to keep making progress. My talks with the executive 
and the prosecutor general have made me optimistic that we will 
gradually iron out our differences and advance in this process. 
  [Arizmendi] Ten days have already elapsed since you said you 
would again carefully study the request to transfer five inmates 
from Modelo prison to the national prison in Itagui. Do you 
have a reply from the prosecutor general on this subject? Will 
he persist in his position? 
  [Arrieta] I have not heard about his official position on 
the 
subject. I do know that he has requested some additional 
information from the government, which gave him a thorough 
explanation of the government's reservations regarding this 
transfer. I suppose de Greiff is studying the explanation. So 
far, however, there has been no further insistence on this 
transfer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A few minutes ago, Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta 
said it is not true that the United States has stopped sending 
evidence in conjunction with the Medellin Cartel surrender 
process in Colombia. International wire services have, over the 
past few hours, reported that the U.S. State Department will no 
longer cooperate with Colombian justice. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Attorney 
General, what is the official information or reaction to reports 
by international wire services that U.S. legal assistance to 
Colombia has been suspended? 
  [Arrieta] Diego, the information I have from Colombian 
authorities is that this is not true. 
  [Reporter] Where could this information have originated 
then? 
  [Arrieta] I do not know. I think there are too many 
misunderstandings on this topic, too many unverified reports 
circulating. The truth is that the news could have come from any 
of these confusing reports. I reiterate, however, that according 
to the information I have, this is not true. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, what is the situation right now 
regarding U.S.-Colombian relations in conjunction with 
exchanging legal information relating to drug trafficking? 
  [Arrieta] These past few weeks we have talked with the U.S. 
State Department through the U.S. Embassy and with the support 
of the Colombian Government. The idea is to bolster this process 
because we believe that it continues to be fundamental for 
carrying out surrender policies and legal actions in Colombia. I 
do not think there is any sense in denying that relations have 
been tense and difficult, but we are working on this and I hope 
it turns out well and we will be able to rebuild the judicial 
cooperation program. 
  [Reporter] Does cooperation continue despite current 
problems? 
  [Arrieta] Yes, we have received cooperation these past few 
days. Obviously, the intensity and level has dropped 
significantly, but I repeat, I believe it will recover. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The United States has not suspended the exchange of 
evidence and judicial information with Colombia, Ambassador to 
Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan said today, denying reports by 
international news agencies concerning such a suspension. 
  The diplomat said on the contrary, new cooperation systems 
are being studied in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
  According to the Colombian ambassador to Washington, 
although 
there are some differences of criteria between our government 
and the United States over the policy of turning drug 
traffickers over to justice, no break in the exchange of 
judicial information has taken place. 
  [Begin Silva recording] I do not think this decision has 
been 
made, because until recently we have maintained an open and 
clear dialogue with U.S. authorities. At no time has this 
possibility been mentioned. 
  I have stayed frequently and closely in touch with U.S. 
authorities. During none of the official or informal meetings I 
have held with them have they informed me of such a decision. 
[end recording] 
  In the meantime, the attorney general has defended 
Prosecutor 
General de Greiff's administration and said the two countries 
are perfecting the judicial cooperation system. 
  [Begin recording] [Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta] 
The fact of the matter is that there are many people who would 
be interested in blocking this cooperation process. On one 
occasion I have said criminals are the only ones to fish in 
these troubled waters. 
  [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] There have been 
differences that are known to the public, but I trust we can 
embark on a great effort to build and create an atmosphere that 
favors the much-needed judicial cooperation in the international 
area. [end recording]

  [Text] Faced with criticism triggered by the Cali Cartel 
surrender process, the Prosecutor General's Office has issued a 
communique. The communique from the prosecutor general contains 
seven specific points: 
  1. His activities have been directed at the fight against 
all 
manifestations of crime. The destruction of the Medellin Cartel 
was due to constant work by the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  3. [Number as heard] All the work of the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office has been carried out within the framework of the penal 
code and the law recently reformed by Congress with full 
knowledge of the government. 
  4. The specific objective of the criticism regarding the 
spiritless contribution of consumer countries to the fight 
against drug-trafficking is to fight that illegal activity. 
  The final point of the communique notes the legalization of 
some drugs could become a deadly weapon capable of depriving 
drug traffickers of profits. The prosecutor general concluded 
the communique by stating he would rather die than live in a 
country where criminals can decide who will be the country's 
government officials and judges.

  [Text] The surrenders and their negotiations have prompted 
a controversy over the attorney general's actions. These 
surrenders have made the North Americans furious, and the 
problem is going from bad to worse. 
  A top-level meeting to discuss the problem was held at the 
Presidential Palace this morning. At the end of the meeting, 
one of the participants, the government minister, played down 
the importance of the controversy. 
  [Begin recording] [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] It 
was 
a working meeting, just like the others we have been holding in 
recent weeks, to coordinate among the executive branch, the 
Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's Office the 
implementation of the surrender policy to benefit justice in the 
country and to use it as a tool to end impunity. 
  [Reporter] I imagine that the prosecutor general versus the 
U.S. Congress topic was discussed at the meeting. 
  [Villegas] We discussed, among other topics, the 
international effects of disagreements over the surrender 
policy. I hope that the drug-consuming nations in general and 
the international community will continue and even step up the 
efforts made so far to support Colombia's struggle against drug 
trafficking. [end recording]

Development] has sounded the alarm: Drug trafficking money is 
flooding Colombia. Money laundering is at the wholesale level 
here. The measures adopted to control money laundering equally 
affect legitimate businessmen. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] About $4 billion 
from drug trafficking reportedly arrives in the country each 
year. The most common method to introduce money is through 
construction, cars, and many consumption goods like food and 
presents. 
  [Fedesarrollo President Eduardo Lora] Almost every product 
can be imported by purchasing it abroad using foreign currency 
that was bought at very low exchange rates and used as money 
laundering mechanisms. 
  [Reporter] The National Superintendency of Banks and the 
National Customs and Tax Directorate are currently investigating 
some 5,300 violations of foreign exchange guidelines that 
businessmen, importers, and even banks have concocted. At least 
90 percent of them are supposedly involved in money laundering. 
  [Bank Superintendent Jose Elias Melo] Financial institutions 
are frequently involved in money laundering operations because 
they handle money. 
  [Lora] The attraction stems from the slowness of the 
devaluation process, which makes stashing money in Colombia more 
profitable than stashing it abroad. 
  [Reporter] Colombia lacks legislation to control money 
laundering. Meanwhile, measures to restrain lawful money, such 
as credit restrictions, affect drug traffickers and legitimate 
businessmen equally. [end recording]

can have true justice in Colombia. I would not modify it. If 
we have not been able to completely organize that office, the 
important thing is to provide it with the resources so we can 
have a real Prosecutor General's Office. We must not try to

  [General Miguel Maza, National Civic Consensus] The 
Prosecutor General's Office needs regulations. Why not increase 
its coverage? It has become deadlocked in the narcotics problem 
and in the voluntary surrender policy. 
  [Antonio Navarro Wolff, 19 April Movement Democratic

is using them, albeit controversially. Nevertheless, he is 
undoubtedly making use of his powers, and that is good. He is a 
person who firmly believes in his convictions. [end recording]

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff announced today 
that protection has been pulled from the family of Pablo 
Escobar. The prosecutor said that as of today the Prosecutor 
General's Office is no longer responsible for the security of 
the wife and children of the late leader of the Medellin Cartel. 
Alvaro Ayala has the report. 
  [Begin recording] [Ayala] The prosecutor general has 
officially announced the withdrawal of security that was 
provided by his personnel to the Escobar Henao family. He 
explained that the Army and police are the government agencies 
now responsible for this service. 
  [De Greiff] I understand that the protection was withdrawn 
as 
of today. That protection had been reduced gradually, and, as 
of today, it has been withdrawn completely. 
  [Ayala] Why did no one cooperate, and who should assume this 
responsibility? 
  [De Greiff] That is what happens to Colombia. They want us 
to supply all of the corpses and make all of the efforts, while 
other countries do not help at all. 
  [Ayala] The prosecutor general concluded by saying he never 
told the Escobar Henao family to move to the northern sector of 
Santa Fe de Bogota but that they can move anywhere they want 
because they are not wanted by the law. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast''] </F>
  [Text] [Anchorwoman Yolanda Ruiz] Another key man in the 
cartel of northern Valle del Cauca has just surrendered. He is 
Joyner Ospina Montoya, charged with drug trafficking and money 
laundering. In the negotiations prior to his surrender, his 
lawyers reportedly reached an agreement on a sentence that could 
mean he would only serve two years in jail. The "National 
Newscast" was the only medium to witness the surrender. 
  [Reporter Sandra Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya appeared 
before the Regional Office of the Prosecutor General in Cali at 
1030 this morning. Ospina, his wife, and Cesar Guzman, his 
lawyer, rode in these vehicles from the Plaza de Toros 
neighborhood, south of Cali, to the Regional Office of the 
Prosecutor General. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] This voluntary act is a show of 
confidence and faith in Colombian justice and the policy of 
surrendering. It is a sign of efficient cooperation with 
justice. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why did he surrender? To what crimes 
will he confess? 
  [Guzman] Mr. Ospina today will confess to violating Law 30, 
the crime of drug trafficking, and money laundering. He will 
not confess to any other crime. [end recording] 
  [Vergara] These crimes could land him in jail for 30 years, 
but thanks to the benefits offered by the law, his sentence 
would be reduced to four years, not counting study and work 
while in prison, which would cut his sentence another two years. 
As the "National Newscast" learned, he will disclose the names 
of other members of the organization and reveal the routes used 
for drug trafficking and money laundering. Joyner Ospina 
Montoya will be interrogated in a few hours, and later he will 
be taken to Palmira Prison. He will be held in the same wing 
where drug trafficker Julio Fabio Urdinola is jailed. 
  [Ruiz] According to the authorities, Joyner Ospina Montoya 
was also the man in charge of transporting the organization's 
drugs. Let us see who he is. 
  [Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya, 28 years old, married, and 
father of two children was born in Dovia north of Valle. He is 
another member of the northern drug trafficking ring once headed 
by Juan Urdinola Grajales. He got involved in drug trafficking 
in 1988 in the United States. In 1990 he came to Colombia and 
became the right-hand man of Julio Fabio Urdinola, another 
member of this organization who surrendered to justice 15 days 
ago. 
  Ospina Montoya was in charge of shipping and distributing 
cocaine to the United States. He was also in charge of 
laundering money from the United States to Colombia. To date, 
we have no information of any legal process Colombian justice 
may have against him. We have learned, however, that he is 
facing charges for drug trafficking in U.S. courts. U.S. 
authorities tapped the telephones Ospina Montoya used to make 
all his contacts. In addition, informers confirmed his 
participation in drug trafficking and money laundering.

  [Text] Cali Cartel drug trafficker Julio Fabio Urdinola has 
confessed to five crimes at the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  Deputy Prosecutor Francisco Sintura provided EL TIEMPO with 
this information, saying it was evidence that drug traffickers 
in this area of the country want to cooperate with the law. 
  Urdinola, who surrendered to authorities on 12 March, 
confessed to drug trafficking, conspiracy, illegal possession of 
weapons, illegal enrichment, and use of false documents. In his 
confession, Urdinola asserted that he had introduced more than a 
ton of cocaine into the United States. 
  Urdinola, who is currently under arrest at Palmira Jail, 
confessed to a faceless prosecutor in Cali that he was part of a 
powerful drug trafficking organization in Valle del Cauca. 
Urdinola also admitted that some of his properties were 
obtained through the illegal drug trade. 
  Sintura told EL TIEMPO that Urdinola initially expressed his 
interest in surrendering and receiving the benefits the law 
provides on 12 March. In announcing his desire to surrender, 
Urdinola expressed his willingness to provide authorities with a 
written confession of the crimes for which he is surrendering. 
  After Urdinola appeared before the judicial authorities, the 
prosecutor's office ordered a medical examination to determine 
his state of health at the time he entered Palmira Jail. 
Urdinola was also fingerprinted to confirm his identity. 
  Urdinola and his assistant, Ancizar Porras, will remain in 
custody at the Palmira Jail infirmary while the Justice Ministry 
completes its work at the installations where surrendering drug 
traffickers will be confined. 
  In contrast with the opinion expressed by Attorney General 
Gustavo Arrieta Padilla, Sintura said that Urdinola is a top 
leader in the cartel of northern Valle del Cauca, so his 
surrender is a very important achievement for the administration 
of justice. 
  Urdinola expanded his confession to the Prosecutor's Office 
during an interrogation on the afternoon of 14 March.

  [Text] San Jose, 20 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican antinarcotics 
police are currently investigating possible connections of a 
drug trafficking group dismantled this past Friday in Alajuela, 
30 km west of San Jose, with the Colombian Pereira drug cartel. 
Colombian citizens Luis Carlos Diez Diez and Moises Nader 
Vargas, as well as Costa Rican citizen Carlos Alvarado were 
arrested during the police operation. According to the 
authorities, the group had smuggled approximately 720 kg of 
cocaine to Europe through Costa Rica. 
  Public Security Minister Luis Fishman said 17 Costa Rican 
nationals currently detained in Spain, Netherlands, Germany, 
Belgium, France, and Italy on drug trafficking charges could 
belong to this group. During the past six years, the Colombian 
drug cartels have used Costa Rica to transfer cocaine to the 
United States and Europe. It is estimated that between two and 
four tons of cocaine are being shipped monthly from Costa Rica 
despite government efforts to crack-down on drug trafficking. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, anti-narcotics agencies seized 
approximately 1,500 kg of cocaine. More than 100 foreigners, 
including several Colombians, are imprisoned in Costa Rican 
jails as a result of their links to drug trafficking.

  [Text] Nine kg of pure cocaine, four pistols, a pickup 
truck, and a jeep were seized by the National Directorate for 
Drug Control (DNCD) from three brothers they arrested during a 
raid on their residence in La Romana. 
  Those under arrest are the brothers Felix, Jose, Livio, and 
Juan Eligio Perez Garcia, as well as Juan Eligio Sanchez, whose 
mistress was detained temporarily and released when she was 
proven innocent of drug trafficking. 
  The raid took place at house No. 2 on C Street, in the Ramon 
Matias Mella district. 
  The DNCD explained that it had received confidential 
reports, 
and issued instructions to one of its officers to check them 
out. He remained on the trail of the subjects for two weeks, 
until the purchase and detection of the nine kg, at the time of 
the transaction. 
  While the covert agent was in view of the merchandise and 
the 
drug dealers selling it, a contingent suddenly invaded the 
dwelling, accompanied by the assistant prosecutor. 
  According to the directorate, one of the brothers arrested, 
Livio, was a fugitive who had been booked previously for the 
same crime. 
  The drug traffic suppression agency claimed to have seized a 
Smith &amp; Wesson pistol, a clip, and a red jeep from Sanchez. 
  As for the Perez Garcia brothers, it reported that a Llama 
pistol with a clip was seized from Felix; a Browning with a 
clip, from Jose; and a Dan Wesson and a cream-colored pickup 
truck, from Livio. 
  The Drug Control Directorate reported that it is continuing 
the investigations, in order to locate those who were acting as 
contacts for those captured, noting that the latter will be 
subjected to court action.

<F P=106> [Article by Geomar Garcia] </F>
  [Text] It was learned today that the National District 
prosecutor, Ramon Gonzalez Hardy, will analyze new charges 
brought yesterday by the National Directorate for Drug Control 
(DNCD) against those accused of trafficking 399 kg of cocaine to 
Miami, to determine whether the reopening of the case is in 
order. These individuals received the benefit of a "no cause" 
verdict on Friday, 14 January. 
  The new "evidence" reportedly was turned over to the 
prosecutor this Thursday morning, during a visit to the DNCD 
headquarters, where a meeting was held with high officials of 
the antidrug agency. 
  The content of the report said to have been prepared by the 
DNCD legal office was not explained. However, the statement was 
made that, "it is consistent to keep those benefiting from the 
`no cause' verdict in prison, and to take them to the criminal 
court." 
  Those who benefited from the release order of the Santo 
Domingo Classification Chamber are Roberto Antonio Tonos Mauad, 
Ramon Emeregildo Abreu Diaz, Guillermo Enrique Torchio 
Hernandez, Manuel Orlando Barrcus, Julio de Jesus Sanchez, 
Tirson Cesar de Leon Reyes, Julia Rosina Oneyda de la Cruz, 
Carlos Juan Robles Sosa, Benito Rodriguez Nunez, Anibal 
Alcantara de los Santos, Julio Valentin Alcantara Rosario, 
Francisco Valdez Garcia, Benjamin Valdez Jaquez, and Sergio 
Tulio Fontana. 
  The attorney general of the Republic, Efrain Reyes Duluc, 
and 
the prosecutor of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals, Jose 
Leonardo Duran Fajardo, investigated to learn whether there were 
any anomalies in the release order that benefited the accused. 
  Dr. Duran Fajardo claimed that the investigation had been 
ordered because of "charges and information" to the effect that 
this decision had been handed down improperly. 
  The judges who issued the "no cause" verdict are Jose Ramon 
Lantigua, of the Santo Domingo Court of Appeals; Danilo Diaz 
Diaz, of the National District's Ninth Chamber of Criminal 
Proceedings; and Juan Ubaldo Castillo, of the Monte Plata court. 
  The notice of the Classification Chamber's decision was 
given 
to the National District prosecutor's office on Monday, 17 
January, through the Criminal Department. 
  Prosecutor Gonzalez Hardy began studying the case records on 
Tuesday, 18 January, and, on Wednesday, the 19th, announced that 
he would sign the release order if no new charges were submitted 
to him against the accused. 
  The official said that he would take note of Dr. Duran 
Fajardo's statements regarding the investigation of the 
Classification Chamber's decision. 
  The procedure has been established whereby, after the 
Classification Chamber's "no cause" verdict is officially 
announced, the Public Prosecutor's Office has 48 hours to order 
the release of those benefiting from the decision, if no new 
charges are brought to reopen the case.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Quito--The Ministry of Government, State Attorney 
General's Office, and Superintendency of Banks have agreed to 
put into effect a series of legal and technical measures to 
prevent, investigate, repress, and eradicate the conversion and 
transfer of money from the drug trade within the financial and 
banking systems, or through other legal instruments operating in 
the country. 
  Those responsible for conducting the investigations will be 
the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances [CONSEP] and the National Police. 
  Based on these new measures, when the National Police have 
well-founded records showing that an individual or corporate 
body is using any entity in the financial system subject to 
control and surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks to 
convert or transfer assets from the drug trade, they will 
request, through the national director of narcotics 
investigations and Interpol, that the CONSEP executive secretary 
demand of the financial institution that is apparently being 
used any data and information required for the investigation. 
  These investigative processes are to be carried out jointly 
with representatives of the police, the Superintendency of 
Banks, the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances, and the banking institution, as the 
case may be. 
  Such inspections will be confidential in nature, and their 
results must be turned over directly by authorized personnel 
from the National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and 
Interpol to the CONSEP executive secretary or, in his absence, 
to the legal counsel office director. No other unauthorized 
person may participate. 
  If the CONSEP executive secretary deems the request made by 
the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol 
for inspections in any bank to be in order, he will officially 
notify the financial institution's legal representative. The 
latter will be required to submit directly the data and 
information detailed in the request prepared by the police. 
  The enjoined institution's legal representative must send 
the 
data and information requested by the CONSEP executive secretary 
directly to that official within a 10-day period. This interval 
may be extended at the request of the financial entity. The data 
and information submitted will be confidential in nature. 
  Immediately after the CONSEP executive secretary receives 
the 
requested information, he will make it known to the national 
director of narcotics investigations and Interpol, or to the 
person authorized by the latter. 
<H5>  Final Report </H5>
  The National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and 
Interpol will be obliged to send to the CONSEP executive 
secretary's office and to the Superintendency of Banks a copy of 
the final report on the investigations conducted. 
  In instances wherein the presence of members of the National 
Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol is required 
in the institution in which the investigation sought by the 
CONSEP executive secretary is to be made, this fact will be 
announced to the enjoined institution's legal representative. It 
will be stated in a message informing him that the investigation 
is to be conducted and will include the list of personnel who 
will be visiting the institution. 
  If, at the request of the CONSEP secretary, an agent from 
the 
Superintendency of Banks is to participate, that person will 
attend with written authorization from the superintendent. 
  The data and information obtained by members of the National 
Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol will be 
reported directly to the national director of narcotics 
investigations and Interpol. They will notify the CONSEP 
executive secretary that the procedure has been implemented. 
  If one of the institutions subject to control and 
surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks is suspected of 
making conversions or transfers of funds to the financial 
system, the Superintendency of Banks, at its own initiative or 
at the request of the CONSEP executive secretary, will conduct 
the pertinent examinations in cooperation with the National 
Police. They will be based on the parameters stipulated in the 
General Law on Banks and the other laws governing the subject. 
  The message in which the CONSEP executive secretary notifies 
the superintendent of banks of the aforementioned suspicion will 
contain suitable grounds, and must specify the causes and 
records that have prompted those suspicions. 
  Once the examination has been made, if there is evidence 
that 
the institution under investigation has converted or transferred 
money, securities, freely convertible instruments, and those of 
legal tender originating in the drug traffic or its related 
activities to the financial system, the Superintendency of Banks 
will make the report on the examination known to the competent 
authorities. 
  This measure also will be in order when the Superintendency 
of Banks, upon making a routine examination of the institutions 
subject to its control and surveillance, detects a possible 
participation by the examined institution in the crimes of 
conversion, concealment, or transfer of assets classified and 
penalized in the Law on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. 
This includes the institution's financing for the commission of 
the crimes specified in that law.

  [Excerpts] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir has described 
the possible approval of voluntary military service proposed by 
President Carlos Roberto Reina as "total destruction" of the 
Armed Forces. The military chief explained that Hondurans are 
not ready for such a step because they do not have enough 
education and culture, aside from the fact that it would weaken 
the Armed Forces. [passage omitted] 
  The military chief said that the money circulating in the 
nation's drug market far exceeds the national budget of a 
country such as Honduras. He reported that the Police, Army, 
Air Force, and Navy are conducting joint operations that have 
led to the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of large 
amounts of drugs. He added that efforts have been intensified, 
particularly in Islas de la Bahia, which has become a key point 
for drug contraband. 
  Discua said he could neither confirm nor deny charges by a 
former judge that the traditional political parties paid for 
their campaigns with drug money because he does not have any 
information to that effect. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Reynosa, Tamaulipas, 23 February--A fire on a tank 
truck inside a warehouse located in the Colonia Las Cumbres 
early this morning revealed a shipment of nearly four tons of 
marijuana contained in another similar vehicle and a pickup 
truck. The fire chief, Jose Pulido Calvillo, made this 
announcement. He reported that, as of this morning, the drugs 
still remained in that warehouse, because the strong butane gas 
odor prevented their transfer to the force's storage facility, 
even though the blaze was under control. 
  The warehouse guard, identified as Jose Luis Sanchez, was 
seriously injured, sustaining burns when the fire began between 
midnight and 0100 today, at that warehouse located at No. 1168 
East Second Street in the aforementioned settlement. 
  Pulido Calvillo said that, when residents of the section 
reported the blaze, the firefighting personnel responded 
immediately to extinguish it. The tank truck in question, 
containing butane gas residue, exploded, causing the fire. 
  He explained that another truck and a pickup were located 
nearby and, when both vehicles were searched, the packed 
marijuana was discovered. 
  He added that the pickup truck is presumed to have been 
loaded with the drug for local distribution, with the rest 
intended for shipment to the United States. 
  He said that the Federal and State Judicial Police were 
notified, as well as the agent at the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, Francisco Vargas Pelayo, who undertook the 
investigation of the case. 
  The first-named agency and the social representative did not 
reveal the firm names on the tank trucks and the other vehicle, 
nor the names of the truck and warehouse owners, so as to avoid 
interfering with the investigation.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] While the Antidrug Bill stagnates at the National 
Assembly, drug trafficking and consumption continue to grow as 
the crisis that overwhelms us. According to the latest police 
reports for the 1981-89 and 1990-93 periods, the consumption of 
drugs has increased 112 percent. 
  Leonel Espinoza, National Police deputy director and 
regiment 
commander, presented the raw figures on drug trafficking and 
consumption of cocaine, crack, and marijuana to the National 
Assembly at a debate of the drug bill, which is being examined 
by magistrates, government ministry officials, and delegates 
from nongovernment organizations. 
  During the forum-debate, which was sponsored by the National 
Assembly, the Program to Support the Promotion of and Training 
for Human Rights in Central America [UCA-CEE], and the National 
Antidrug Committee, the deputy police chief gave a historical 
account of drug trafficking activities in the Atlantic up to 
1989, when cocaine was traded for liquor, home appliances, and 
shrimp near Corn Island. 
  When the current government assumed office on 25 April 1990, 
the control and surveillance systems in the national territory 
virtually disintegrated and South American drug cartels launched 
a plan to make Nicaragua the springboard for shipping drugs to 
the United States, Europe, and other countries of the world. 
People who had relations with drug dealers in the United States 
began arriving in Nicaragua in 1990. These people had the 
ability to set up traffic routes and make the country a drug 
warehouse. "We have no doubts that large quantities of drugs are 
passing through Nicaragua en route to the United States," 
Commander Espinoza said in a debate attended by only five of the 
Assembly's 92 members. Criminal Prosecutor Jose Antonio Fletes 
and National Assembly Drug Commission head Doris Tijerino have 
criticized the absenteeism. 
  According to official statistics, 535.936 kg of cocaine were 
seized, 20 marijuana plots were discovered, and 145 people were 
arrested in 1990. In 1991, 761.642 kg of cocaine and 13 bundles 
plus 33 kg of marijuana were confiscated, 5,570 marijuana plants 
were destroyed, and 58 people were arrested. In 1992, the police 
seized 155.449 kg of cocaine, nine kg of heroin--the latter in 
an Ecuadoran-made picture frame bound for Ecuador from Istambul 
aboard a banana-carrying ship--and 1,124 pounds (lb) of 
marijuana, and 31,068 marijuana plants were destroyed. In 
addition, 430 people were arrested. 
  In 1993, authorities seized 96.209 kg of cocaine, 517 lb of 
marijuana, and 159 crack lumps, destroyed 9,408 plants, and 
arrested 1,517 people. This indicates a larger number of people 
involved in drug trafficking. In 1994, 540 kg of cocaine were 
confiscated in the Ocean Operation; 108 kg were confiscated in 
Puerto Cabezas in a boat reportedly to have arrived with 900 kg. 
The community of Sandy Bay and Brooklyn Rivera surrendered 93 
kg. The police recovered another 20 kg. In all, 108 kg of drugs 
were confiscated and later destroyed in Puerto Cabezas. 
Commander Espinoza confirmed that in Managua raids, the police 
have found cocaine from a shipment arriving aboard launches 
through Sandy Bay in the Atlantic. 
  From January to March this year, the police have seized 574 
kg (450 in the Oceano Operation), 108 from Sandy Bay, and the 
rest from drug traffickers, Espinoza said. From 1990-93, 
1,549.23 kg of cocaine were seized by the police. Of these, 
1.227 tonnes came from the international drug market and 322 kg 
from the local market. Most of it from the Atlantic. The amounts 
seized have been increasing steadily. In comparison with 
international parameters, Nicaraguan authorities barely catch 
four percent of the total traffic. Comparing police statistics 
for the 1981-89 and 1990-93 periods, "we see that drug 
trafficking has increased 112 percent, a very alarming number," 
he said. 
  Referring to the drug bill which the Assembly is debating, 
he 
said it is essential. He pointed out, however, that some of the 
articles on confiscation "should specify that the drug seized 
should be accredited 50-50 percent to the Police and the Health 
and Education Ministries."

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Panama will seek a consensus for getting the U.S. 
Congress to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Now that the 
elections are near, do you think this will delay the U.S. 
Congress in approving MLAT? We have not yet received any answer 
to that effect. 
  [Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino] I am leaving for 
Washington on Wednesday for bilateral conversations with U.S. 
State Department officials and some congressmen. I have 
requested an appointment with Senator Helms, the undersecretary 
of state for Latin American Affairs, and the secretary of the 
Panama Canal Commission Board of Directors to officially talk 
about topics of mutual interest. This treaty is obviously one of 
these topics. I do not see why our electoral process should 
interfere with the Senate approving the treaty, which should be 
an urgent issue because of the importance of the document to the 
bilateral mechanism that it establishes between our two 
governments and both nations' goals for the fight against drugs. 
  [Reporter] Apparently the U.S. Government is not aware of 
that urgency because there has not been any reply so far. 
  [Mulino] I would not say that about the U.S. Government. The 
government as such, the executive branch, did what it had to do: 
negotiate and sign the treaty. 
  [Reporter] Is it the Senate then? 
  [Mulino] It is in the hands of the Senate, and it is up to 
the legislative branch to do its work. That is precisely the 
purpose of my visit. I am going to talk with them; explain that 
we are interested in it becoming a mechanism that will very 
shortly become law. We will exchange the documents whereby both 
senates [as heard] ratify it, and then we will proceed to 
implement it. I think it is a very effective and good measure 
for collaborating in the fight against drugs and similar crimes. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> ["Summary" of the government's "National Plan for Drug </F>
Prevention and Control," which was drafted by a team of experts 
presided over by Air Force General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez] 
  [Text] Part 1: Problem Diagnosis 
  1. General Context 
  1.1 General Considerations 
  Over the past two decades the problem of drugs in Peru has 
increased and become very complex. There is general consensus 
that: 
  a. the very large production of coca for illegal purposes 
is--in most cases--encouraged by foreign interests; 
  b. the number of users of legal and illegal drugs such as 
tobacco, alcohol, cocaine paste, inhaled toxic materials, 
marijuana, etc., has increased significantly; 
  c. the traffic and illegal trading of legal and illegal 
drugs, the criminal activities provoked by this activity, and 
the grave consequences of drug addiction have increased; 
  d. criminal activities, which have overwhelmed the capacity 
of legislators, have evolved very fast; 
  e. there is a need for coordinated action by the involved 
nations against the international character of this illegal 
trade. 
  1.2 Historic and Cultural Context 
  From time immemorial, coca cultivation has been part of the 
tradition and custom of the Andean peasant. Coca is used for 
chewing, for trade, medicinally, and in social and religious 
ceremonies. It has a sacred meaning for the people. 
  1.3 Geographical Context 
  The Peruvian territory--which lies in the west-central part 
of the South American continent--comprises three macroeconomic 
regions: The coastal region, which represents 10 percent of the 
territory; the ranges, which represents 31 percent; and the 
Andean Amazon jungle which represents 59 percent. The 
high-elevation jungle ecosystems of this region, with steep 
hills and high humidity between 600 and 2,000 meters above sea 
level, are right for coca cultivation. 
  1.4 Economic, Political, and Social Context 
  Peru has a population of 22 million people. Social and 
economic indicators have dropped over the past 30 years and are 
today among the lowest in Latin America. This economic 
depression has impoverished the Andean region, forcing its 
inhabitants to migrate to coastal and higher jungle zones where 
foreign pressures provoked a staggering increase in the coca 
plantations. In 1990 the government launched an economic 
stabilization program seeking to reinsert the country into the 
international economic community. The program obtained 
important results in the control of inflation and the 
reorganization of the productive apparatus. 
  International drug traffickers have made large profits by 
purchasing cheap coca from Peruvian peasants and selling it back 
transformed into cocaine. To protect their interests, drug 
traffickers then decided to become associated with terrorists. 
Over the past seven years this alliance has tied up a 
considerable proportion of human and material resources which 
could have been used to fight trafficking. The successful 
campaign to pacify the country that began in 1992, and the 
government's political willingness to fight the scourge, have 
created new hopes for a successful future campaign against drugs 
in the country. 
  2. Production 
  2.1 Coca Leaf Production 
  The cultivation of coca for legal purposes, which is being 
implemented particularly in traditional Andean areas (Cuzco, 
Huanuco, Puno, Cajamarca, Ancash, Junin, and Huancavelica, among 
others) currently involves around 20,000 hectares and some 
27,000 peasant families. The "National Coca Enterprise," which 
by law has the monopoly on the marketing of coca, presently 
controls less than half the cultivated area and the coca 
produced for legal purposes. 
  The lack of trustworthy and current data on coca cultivation 
in Peru is a serious obstacle in properly understanding the 
situation and in proposing alternative solutions to the problem 
it represents. 
  From the estimated 129,000 hectares of plantations for 
non-traditional purposes, some 223,900 tonnes should be 
harvested annually. This activity occupies at least 200,000 
peasant families and produces an estimated annual revenue of 
$300 million. 
  2.2 Production of Cocaine Base and Cocaine Hydrochloride 
  Exportable cocaine base in Peru allegedly totals 900 tonnes 
(worth approximately $600 million per year). This can be used 
to produce approximately 700 tonnes of cocaine per year. Some 
90 percent of the cocaine base is bought by Colombian interests, 
for processing later. 
  2.3 Production of Other Crops 
  There is worrying evidence of poppy cultivation in several 
places in Peru, backed by foreign interests linked to a heroine 
connection. 
  2.4 Impact of Illegal Crops on the Environment 
  Coca cultivation and the illegal use of its byproducts cause 
very serious damage to the jungle ecosystem, like: 
  -- the deforestation of higher jungle areas not fit for 
agriculture, consequently provoking hydro-biological changes and 
harming biodiversity; 
  -- the direct erosion of soil by effect of coca cultivation; 
  -- the contamination of soil and rivers, as well as of the 
flora and fauna as a consequence of the indiscriminate use of 
biocidal fertilizers and chemical components used to transform 
coca into PBC (cocaine base) and PBL (washed coca paste). 
  2.5 The Use of Coca in Traditional Medicine 
  The therapeutic and nutritional properties of coca are 
currently under study by the Traditional Medicine Institute of 
the Health Ministry. Promising results have been obtained so 
far. Its conclusions will serve as the basis for future actions 
by the government, seeking to solve the controversy over the 
classification of coca. 
  2.6 Peruvian Experience in Alternative Development 
  In terms of strategy, the Peruvian Government gives the 
highest priority to Alternative Development for which it seeks 
the help of the social groups involved in this activity. 
  Alternative Development programs have experienced financial 
difficulties. The search for new mechanisms to raise funds for 
these programs will be subject of concrete actions in the future. 
  3. The Illegal Trafficking of Drugs 
  3.1 The Illegal Trafficking of Drugs 
  The Repression of illegal trafficking is of major importance 
at a national and international level. 
  Peru has approved extensive regulations, in keeping with 
international treaties, to classify and punish all types of 
illegal trafficking. 
  Along with the emphasis on repressive measures, norms have 
also been approved to legalize the cultivation of coca in the 
country, while specific cases of addiction and possession for 
personal use have also been legalized. 
  The current plan considers tightening control on criminal 
actions through a systemic approach, when the illegal 
trafficking of drugs can be described as "organized crime." 
  3.2 Situation in Peru 
  The illegal trafficking of drugs (TID) began as a criminal 
activity in Peru in around 1960. It gradually became a threat 
to political, economic, and social stability--because of its 
nature and because of its tie up with terrorist criminals who 
seek to obtain mutual benefits. 
  The subdividing of international TID has created a situation 
where Peruvian trafficking groups or "firms"--like the one 
headed by Demetrio Limonier-Chavez Penaherrera, aka 
"Vaticano"--can control the production, sale, and storage of PBC 
and PBL prior to its transportation by Colombian cartels for 
refining and later introduction into consumer markets, taking 
advantage of its leading role in the trafficking structure. 
  3.3 Organization and Dynamics of the Illegal Trafficking of 
Drugs 
  By nature, the illegal trafficking of drugs is performed by 
gangs organized at a national and international level, which 
control the production, sale, transportation, and storage and/or 
transfer of funds through "money laundering," using--throughout 
the process--methods and technology to minimize risks. 
  Through their economic capacity, they exercise diverse 
influence on society, creating corruption mechanisms, violating 
internal laws, winning the goodwill of people through 
superficially benevolent development activities, and through 
protection rackets. 
  4. The Improper Use of Drugs 
  Legal and/or socially accepted substances like tobacco and 
alcohol head the list of most-consumed psycho-active substances 
in Peru. They involve the highest risk because their use 
initiates the habit among minors and leads to the consumption of 
illegal drugs. 
  The illegal use of drugs is the responsibility of all social 
groups. The problem presents itself in different ways, and in 
that sense, is a problem that concerns not only minors, the 
poor, or unaffected individuals: It affects all social and 
economic groups. 
  Outright prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation policies 
have not obtained the expected results because they fail to 
attack all aspects of the problem. It is necessary to implement 
overall policies that give priority to the participation of the 
population from their grassroots organizations. 
  5. The Institutional Framework 
  The official way to deal with drugs in Peru has been 
basically through criminal prosecution. 
  The appearance of new aspects of the problem during the 
1980's contributed to change the official perception of the 
issue and prompted the government to try new answers. 
  The economic and social aspects became the main causes of 
the 
problem's present magnitude. Terrorism and its alliance with 
the illegal trade became one of the greatest threats to social 
peace and public order. 
  The greatest problem affecting the institutional answer to 
the problem is the lack of an integrated system for a more 
rational use of the equipment and resources dedicated to fight 
the scourge. The absence of a valid policy representative 
(planner, coordinator, and policies' implementation officer) has 
reduced the effect of state actions. 
  6. International Arena 
  Peru has participated in the world crusade against this 
scourge since 1912. It has signed international instruments 
drawn up by the community of nations. 
  Our actions have involved the bilateral, multilateral, and 
regional arenas. In the past few years the Peruvian state has 
sought the recognition of the principle of "shared 
responsibility" and "integral response" in the handling of the 
problem, which has traditionally been faced from a juridical and 
repressive viewpoint. 
  It is worth noting that the Peruvian proposal seeks the 
international community's understanding of the meaning of this 
struggle in our country and the important contribution we are 
making to the global effort to solve the problem. 
  Part 2: National Plan for Drug Prevention and Control 
  1. Objective 
  1.1 The conceptual framework 
  The conceptual framework is defined by a methodical 
interpretation of the Peruvian people's attitude, which is 
expressed through daily and multiple demonstrations (debates, 
seminars, experts' meetings, etc.). This attitude projects a 
defined image of the people's desire to achieve the general 
objective. 
  1.2 General Objective 
  A gradual reduction of coca cultivated for nontraditional 
use 
through alternative development and environmental protection 
programs; a reduction of the improper use of drugs and the 
consequences of addiction through integral prevention and 
appropriate treatment programs; the repression of illegal 
production and trade within a framework of respect for the law 
and human rights in order to protect the well-being and dignity 
of individuals, and a contribution with the international 
struggle against the problem. 
  2. Politics 
  The government reiterates its political willingness to fight 
this scourge, with due respect for all international agreements, 
and calls on all national groups to fight against the illegal 
trade based on five guiding principles: 
  a. the right of peasants to a free, viable, and dignified 
alternative; 
  b. the unity of all Peruvians in the face of this world 
scourge; 
  c. the national desire to confront this phenomenon; 
  d. a shared responsibility, which strengthens international 
understanding and cooperation; 
  e. the Peruvian Government's political decision to fight 
with 
all its energy and ability, legally and with respect for human 
rights. 
  3. Strategy 
  3.1 Concept 
  The strategy adopted by the Peruvian Government is all 
encompassing and provides for strategic lines of action. Its 
implementation calls for the participation of all national 
sectors. 
  3.2 General Strategy 
  Herewith the basic elements of the strategic lines of 
action: 
  a. to establish, in 1994, the necessary juridical and 
institutional framework for the area of drugs; 
  b. to attach, during the 1994-2000 period, the highest 
priority to the implementation of the Alternative Development 
plan for reducing illegal coca plantations; 
  c. to continue the fight against narcotics and drug-related 
crimes, with the cooperation of the Armed Forces; 
  d. to call on the people to participate in an 
all-encompassing preventive action, in treating and 
rehabilitating addicts, and in reducing the social consequences 
of addiction; 
  e. to grant particular attention to international actions 
and 
to joint, cooperative work, based on the principle of shared 
responsibility. 
  4. Specific Objectives 
  a. The National Plan for Drug Prevention and Control 
reflects 
the main factors of the diagnosis made in Part 1 of this 
document, identifying 21 specific objectives: 
  1) Alternative Development: To implement a set of actions 
aimed at gradually replacing the coca economy, for which the 
state will strengthen the structural reform in order to create 
the conditions favorable for developing a competitive economy; 
  2) Participation of the Private Sector: In the 
implementation 
of the Alternative Development programs, the state will create 
the basic necessary conditions and will give real guarantees to 
national and foreign entrepreneurs who wish to invest in areas 
where coca is being produced; 
  3) Investigation for the Advantageous Use of Coca: A 
national 
commission will be created to investigate the therapeutical, 
nutritive, and industrial properties of coca; 
  4) Production for Traditional and Industrial Use: The demand 
for coca for traditional consumption and for legal use will be 
covered by assigning appropriate reserve zones, preferably in 
the areas in which coca has been traditionally produced; 
  5) Environment Preservation: The environmental deterioration 
process, caused by expanded coca farming, will be controlled by 
promoting the recovery and preservation of biological diversity 
of the affected ecosystems and of those that are being 
jeopardized, through adoption of environmental balance measures; 
  6) Monitoring of Land Dedicated to Production of Coca and 
Other Drug-Producing Plants: The state will have permanent, 
updated information of the land dedicated to the production of 
plants from which narcotics are obtained, through remote 
sensoring methods, photogrammetry, and surveying work; 
  7) Development of the Higher Andean Regions Abandoned by the 
Population: These areas will be developed in order to prevent 
the migration of their inhabitants to coca producing areas; 
  8) The National System for Control and Repression of the 
Production and Illegal Trafficking of Drugs, and of Related 
Crimes: National efforts will be strengthened and coordinated 
with a view to controlling and repressing the production and 
illegal trafficking of drugs, the improper use of precursors and 
specific chemicals, the laundering of money and transferring of 
funds, and the smuggling of arms, explosives and related 
activities, in order to facilitate the timely enforcement of the 
law. To this end, the National Control and Repression System 
and Subsystems will be created; 
  9) Control of Production and Illegal Drug Trafficking: 
  A subsystem will be created to coordinate national efforts 
in the control of the production and illegal trafficking of 
drugs; 
  10) Control Over Improper Uses of Precursors and Specific 
Chemicals: Efforts by the national institutions that control 
precursors and specific chemicals will be coordinated; 
  11) Laundering Money and Transferring Funds: National 
efforts 
to control the laundering of money and the transfer of funds 
will be coordinated; 
  12) Smuggling of Arms and Explosives: National efforts to 
control the smuggling of arms and explosives will be coordinated; 
  13) Action against Corruption: Corruption will be controlled 
in the work of the agents in charge of supervision and who use 
their influential position in the structure of the state and in 
financial institutions to favor the illegal trafficking of drugs; 
  14) Comprehensive Prevention: A Comprehensive Prevention 
Program will be developed, based on complete epidemiologic 
studies, to meet school curricular requirements but--with 
creative versatility--and to encourage people to adopt 
prevention as a permanent attitude against drugs; 
  15) Treatment and Rehabilitation: A national treatment 
program will be developed based on the real needs of the 
affected population using classical and alternative methods; 
  16) The Consequences of Acquiescence: A reduction will be 
sought in the social consequences of drug abuse--including 
accidents, the committing of crimes, labor losses, family 
disintegration, and public health associated with the use of 
drugs; 
  17) Information Pertaining To Use: Timely information, 
collected by the state, will be available on levels of the 
excessive use of drugs in the country; 
  18) The Role of the Media: The media will participate in the 
national effort to reduce the supply and demand, and in the 
repression of the illegal traffic of drugs and connected crimes; 
  19) The Institutional Framework: A national system will be 
implemented to handle the drug problem, to plan, coordinate, and 
execute the government's antidrug policy. The National System 
for the Prevention and Control of Drugs will be created to 
direct the resources in the fight against the various aspects of 
this matter; 
  20) Juridical Development: National legislation will be 
harmonized, seeking to standardize state policies on the various 
aspects of the phenomena with the directives and guidelines 
contained in the approved national plan and with agreements and 
declarations signed by Peru; 
  21) International Action: Contributions will be made to the 
international community effort toward the appropriate handling 
of the drug issue--a universal problem as acknowledged in 
international instruments signed by Peru. This will be achieved 
by paying special attention to the way the phenomena is 
characterized in our country, and by improving and implementing 
agreements and mechanisms with other nations and with 
specialized international organizations under the general 
principles of shared responsibility and comprehensive action, 
yet respecting the norms of international law and the principles 
that support it; 
  b. The methodical development of specific objectives will be 
complemented with appropriate policies and strategies, including 
the necessary directives for planning and programming. It will 
also permit the clear defining of the institutions that will 
participate in the process. 
  5. Interconnected Plans and Programs
