Julia Maria Urrunaga: "The Green Runway"] 
  [Text] "Vaticano" had two main accomplices: the Shining 
Path [SL] during one phase and prominent military officials in 
Alto Huallaga during another. However, the drug traffickers will 
be tried by the military courts and the commanding officer of 
the Army has already stated that no one in the military is 
involved. 
  Landing strip used by drug traffickers in Campanilla: The 
encircled area of the photo shows the Peruvian Army's Otorongo 
Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. For the past 
year, it has been used by small planes carrying drugs to 
Colombia in plain sight of the soldiers based there. It was 
built by Vaticano. 
  Although public opinion has for the past two weeks had ears 
for nothing but the alleged connections of drug trafficker 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera with prominent figures in the world 
of entertainment, a disturbing question nevertheless keeps 
cropping up with respect to this shady individual: Was he or was 
he not connected with members of the Armed Forces and Peru's 
National Police (PNP)? 
  Last week, Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the Army, and 
PNP 
General Victor Alva Plasencia both emphatically denied that 
anyone in the military or police has had connections with Chavez 
Penaherrera. 
  Nevertheless, in the midst of the confusion caused by police 
arrests of entertainers, stars, a designer and a former beauty 
queen, rumors and suspicion that members of the Armed Forces or 
the Peruvian Police might be involved in Chavez Penaherrera's 
drug trafficking ring continued to grow. 
  Despite the amount of time that has passed, people still 
have 
vivid memories of the connections of drug trafficker Reynaldo 
Rodriguez Lopez, the "Godfather," with high-ranking National 
Police officials still serving prison terms. 
  So far, statements by (retired) Peruvian Army Major Evaristo 
Castillo Aste published in CARETAS last week provide the first 
indications that would detract from the categorical statements 
made by top-ranking PNP and Army officials to the effect that no 
one in the military or Police is involved with Chavez 
Penaherrera. 
  In the jungle, (retired) Major Castillo Aste served first of 
all as chief of operations and later military adviser to General 
Eduardo Bellido, now political and military head of the Huallaga 
Front. 
  What he said is deserving of an investigation as thorough as 
it must be transparent in order to assess the responsibilities 
of those serving at and assigned to the various military and 
Police bases near the area in which Chavez Penaherrera operated 
in Huallaga Valley. 
  Chavez Penaherrera is unquestionably one of the biggest--if 
not the biggest--drug traffickers in the country. There is also 
some suspicion about his connections with terrorists in the 
area. However, what is particularly troublesome in this case is 
that there does not appear to be the slightest interest on the 
part of either the military or the Police in investigating 
possible cases of corruption committed by members of law 
enforcement agencies. 
  Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has already been accused 
of treason on charges of narcoterrorism. His case is being 
channeled almost automatically to the military courts, where he 
is awaited by a faceless court that will certainly sentence him 
to life in prison. 
  Naturally, when he is turned over to the military courts, 
the 
regular courts of law will be powerless to conduct 
investigations, not only into Vaticano's probable relations with 
members of the Armed Forces and the PNP, but also with 
nonmilitary and nonpolice sectors. 
  The following is a thorough examination of the connections 
that very possibly link Vaticano with certain military and 
Police figures. 
  The information comes from thoroughly reliable sources and, 
as the reader will see, the accuracy and details speak for the 
quality and veracity of the information. 
<H5>  Looking the Other Way </H5>
  Kilometer marker 787 on the Juanjui-Tocache section of 
Marginal Highway in the Department of San Martin, which between 
1990 and mid-1993 was one of the airports set up by Vaticano to 
send cocaine paste (PBC) to Colombia, was not concealed in any 
way. 
  It could not be because located at the end of the 
1,500-meter 
airstrip used by small planes from Colombia is (now blockaded by 
cement barriers and barbed wire) the Peruvian Army's Otorongo 
Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. Both the strip 
and base are next to the town of Campanilla. The base has been 
there, manned by (approximately) 40 soldiers under the command 
of a captain, since before 1989. 
  In other words, there could not have been a single flight, 
shipment of cocaine paste, or takeoff or landing by Colombian 
planes in Campanilla that was not observed by personnel at that 
military base. To deny such complicity, which we shall describe 
in further detail below, would amount to saying that a small 
plane can land in Lima's city square without being seen by 
soldiers guarding the government buildings. 
  The captains assigned to the Campanilla Military Base (and 
who are rotated every three or four months) are not the only 
officers responsible. Their chiefs, who visited the base 
periodically, could not possibly have been unaware of what was 
going on. 
  Even if they did not observe the landings, when making their 
inspections, the officers must have at least wondered what was 
taking place on the 1,500-meter strip! 
  Nor did all the action take place in Campanilla. Nearly all 
the runways built or set up by Vaticano were near military 
bases. Most were run by the Army, as in the case of Tingo Maria, 
Aucayacu, Tocache, Juanjui, Sion, Punta Arenas, Uchiza, Saposoa, 
Bellavista, and Palmapampa. The Peruvian Air Force (FAP) now has 
its own bases at Tingo Maria, Tocache, Juanjui, Uchiza, Saposoa, 
and Bellavista. The Navy has a base at Aguaytia, where a secret 
airport also once operated. 
  The responsibility extends to the highest-ranking officers 
in 
the Armed Forces in the area: the commanding officers of 
Emergency Zone 8 (San Martin and Huanuco) between 1990 and 1993. 
  According to information gathered by this periodical in the 
area and contained in more than one report drafted by members of 
the Army Intelligence Service (as on 22 November 1991, for 
example), the complicity between the chief of the Otorongo Base 
and Vaticano's ring was the result of a financial agreement 
involving at least $3,000 to $4,000 a flight. If one considers 
that not only the captains in charge of the base, but their 
superior officers also consented to the goings-on, then one has 
to conclude--and this is the information that circulates in the 
area--that these superior officers also took payments and in 
larger quantities. 
<H5>  Life in Campanilla </H5>
  The operation run in Campanilla that turned the town into 
the 
biggest center for collections and shipments in Huallaga 
involved most of its 3,111 inhabitants. 
  It is perhaps for that very reason that no one wants to 
speak 
of what was happening in the local streets until only very 
recently. It is as if the entire town had suddenly suffered an 
attack of amnesia. 
  However, Army intelligence reports--which no one heeded at 
the proper time--and accounts gathered in Juanjui can 
reconstruct what the people of Campanilla do not wish to recall: 
  The activity began at the collection centers. The peasants 
went straight to certain homes in town. For example, the house 
where Humberto Chavez Penaherrera lived is on the second block 
of the Julio Romero Castro section, the street running right 
into Campanilla, about 150 meters from the base. 
  The building belongs to his brother, Emilio Chavez 
Penaherrera, who lives on Block 3 of the Alfonso Ugarte section 
in Juanjui, where SI found him. He said he has not seen his 
brother Demetrio since the latter was 15 and ran away from home 
in Campanilla (the Chavez Penaherrera family moved from Saposoa 
to Campanilla when Vaticano was 9) and swore he knew nothing 
about his other siblings Humberto, Bertha, or Bersabe. "We have 
all gone our separate ways and I know nothing about the others," 
he said. 
  The only thing he admitted was that he has a house in 
Campanilla where his brother Humberto lived until his arrest 
late last year: "I left it when I came here from there eight 
years ago to devote all my time to running my lumber business," 
he said. 
  Vaticano was not living in Campanilla. He moved to Colombia 
in 1990 but returned frequently (for important shipments, it is 
said) and stayed at that house when he did so. 
  His sister Bersabe, also under arrest although it is not 
known for what charges, lived across from the Plaza de Armas. 
  Another collection center may have been Humberto's ranch, 
located on the same level as the town but across the Huallaga. 
This would mean transporting the product on rafts to the little 
port of Campanilla across from the ranch. Lower down on the same 
side of the Huallaga lives another brother, Juan II (the Pope is 
also named John). According to those who know him, he is very 
poor. 
  The drug was taken from the collection centers to the 
airstrip. This meant crossing the river or walking a few blocks. 
According to one report from the Army Intelligence Service 
drafted by an agent who visited Campanilla near the end of 1991, 
the haulers or "handlers" carried it in backpacks. They would 
sit down on both sides of the streets and wait for payment or 
some scheduled flight. For their part, the chiefs moved about in 
pickup trucks guarded by armed hired killers. 
  As the time for a flight drew near, they converged on the 
airstrip to make their shipment. The twin-engine planes brought 
the money in dollars. It was unloaded and the drug loaded, some 
800 to 1,000 kilos of cocaine paste on every flight. According 
to the report and as confirmed by anyone visiting Campanilla, 
this all took place "in plain sight of Army personnel." 
  In order to convert coca leaves into paste, the laboratories 
operated in homes or on the riverbanks. When Humberto Chavez was 
arrested on 3 December, a lab operating on the bank of the 
Huallaga opposite his ranch was raided and destroyed. 
  All of this movement in town also presumed the 
complicity--and paying off--of municipal authorities. The mayor 
from 1990 to 1992 was Aprista [American Popular Revolutionary 
Alliance] member Guzman Gonzales Rivadeneyra. 
  But the facilities are different. For Vaticano, Campanilla 
was not just his center of operations. It was also the village 
where his family had come 30 years ago when it amounted to no 
more than a few huts. It is perhaps for that reason that he gave 
the mayor $500,000, the latter admits himself, "counting it out 
one bill at a time," in order to build things: the Plaza de 
Armas, the church, a satellite dish, lights for the town (only 
for the streets lining the square), and street repairs, a la 
Pablo Escobar. 
  However, the current mayor, Reinerio Cardenas Isuiza, told 
SI 
Thursday that all the works were the result of a common effort. 
During his term in office, he said, they had received help from 
Humberto Chavez only to repair streets and only in the form of 
food for the members of the Engineering Battalion: 27 kilos of 
meat a day. Like the residents of the town, the mayor recalls 
nothing at all about drug operations even though he has lived in 
Campanilla for 20 years! 
<H5>  Barriers </H5>
  In September 1992, after the first news reports appears 
concerning Vaticano's activities in Campanilla, the Army itself 
joined with the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] to install 
cement blocks on the runway. 
  However, that was not the end of the complicity. The 
bulletin 
distributed by the National Antidrug Directorate (DINANDRO) at 
the press conference at which Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera was 
presented states that "the barriers were moved at night to the 
edge of the runway so the illicit operations could take place 
(the landings, loading of cocaine paste, and takeoffs), then put 
back in place so as not to awaken suspicion." What did personnel 
at the Otorongo Base do while this was going on in front of 
their very eyes? Army Intelligence reports state that the 
soldiers even got in on the act, loading the bags of cocaine 
paste on the small planes and moving the cement blocks. 
  Only last year, as a result of the intervention of the 
Peruvian Air Force detachment stationed in Juanjui, heavier 
blocks were moved into place and barbed wire and explosives were 
installled. The flights were suspended at Campanilla, but 
continued at other strips run by Vaticano. 
<H5>  "Duck Man" </H5>
  For years, numerous military and police intelligence reports 
told of Vaticano's activities in what is known as Medio Huallaga. 
  According to sources in Huallaga, in 1990 Vaticano financed 
the construction of the landing strip in Campanilla with the aid 
of the San Martin Development Corporation (CORDESAN) and the 
Army. 
  Officials from Corde San Martin, the miniregion of Juanjui, 
and even the Huascaran Engineering Battalion 112 helped set up 
the section between kilometer markers 786 and 787 on the 
Marginal Highway in order to turn it into the Campanilla airport. 
  Peruvian Army Major Briceno headed the Huascaran Engineering 
Battalion 112 which in 1991 and 1992 had as its task the 
reconstruction of the Juanjui-Tocache section of the Marginal 
Highway. Campanilla is at the midway point. From the ground it 
is easy to see the difference in altitude between this kilometer 
and a half and the rest of the highway, which implies that in 
its reconstruction effort, the Engineering Battalion left this 
section intact. 
  Once the terrain had been "separated" for the airport, it 
had 
to be expanded on the sides and leveled for the runway. This was 
done by workers hired by the Juanjui miniregion in the CORDESAN 
jurisdiction, then headed by engineer Sergio Guerra Chombo. 
  Adolfo Isuiza, the newsman from Juanjui who was murdered in 
August 1992 by Vaticano's hired killers, filed this report in 
one of his dispatches to Radio Tropical in Tarapoto. 
  A confidential report drafted in August 1991 by CORDESAN 
confirms the irregularities. The officials involved were Renan 
Morales Azpur, head of the Juanjui-Tocache highway 
reconstruction project, Tito Perez, head of the Juanjui 
miniregion, and the latter's chief, one Rondon. 
  Both the airstrip and one section of the Marginal highway, 
specially equipped, were controlled by Vaticano for the landing 
of Colombian aircraft that took off again loaded with basic 
cocaine paste (PBC). 
  According to information received in Huallaga, Vaticano 
ended 
up operating as many as 240 flights a month. He admitted the 
spectacular figure during DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate] 
interrogations. Then why did the Punta Arenas BCS not take note 
of the affair? The only possible reply: Someone looked the other 
way and more. 
  And yet, Vaticano's drug trafficking operations in the 
jungle 
did not depend solely on the flights of Colombian planes. 
  During certain periods, the combined antidrug operations of 
the FAP, PNP, and DEA observers prevented the entry into or 
departure from Campanilla. Nor is the distance from this spot 
and the Colombian border a small one. 
  However, Vaticano found a solution to the problem posed by 
his operations. 
  Reliable information gathered in Huallaga states, for 
example, that in February 1992, there were signs that Vaticano's 
clan used Army helicopters to move the cocaine paste from 
Huallaga to La Media, an important underground runway located in 
Nueva Jerusalen del Erene, Ramon Castilla-Caballococha Province, 
in Loreto. 
  This clandestine airstrip was only a few minutes from the 
border with Colombia, meaning it was much easier to get the drug 
from Peru at that point. 
  La Media was raided on 23 March 1993, resulting in the 
arrest 
of Colombian drug trafficker Manuel Guillermo Ayala Calderon, 
aka "Paisa" or "Peter," who in statements to the PNP said he had 
had drug trafficking connections with Vaticano. 
  However, what is most important is the existence of very 
precise information detailing how Vaticano could have operated 
with prominent military officials in the area. 
  There are signs that Vaticano was in Lima in February 1992. 
During his absences from Campanilla in 1992, his brother Emilio 
Chavez Penaherrera, "Gigante," ran the "business." However, the 
latter was in constant contact with Vaticano by radio in order 
to receive precise instructions, consult with him when 
necessary, or send messages to him. 
  On 24 February 1992, Gigante told Vaticano that "the duck 
man" urgently wanted to talk with him. 
  According to the information obtained and duly 
cross-checked, 
Vaticano's men used the term "ducks" to refer to Army 
helicopters flying between different spots in Huallaga. 
  Nor is that all: That day, sources in Huallaga say, Vaticano 
talked by radio with "the duck man," whose identity reportedly 
corresponds to a Peruvian Army officer, one Captain De la 
Puente, whose code name in the zone was "Javier." 
  Other reports state that this officer was reportedly a key 
in 
Vaticano's relations with other military men. 
  It is also known that precise reports exist from 1991 
pointing to signs of the use of "ducks" by Vaticano to carry the 
drug from different parts of the valley to Campanilla. 
  In 1991, coordination with the military, and specifically 
with the chief of the BCS in Punta Arenas at the time, was 
reportedly the responsibility of Elias Chavez Penaherrera or 
"Lan Chile," Vaticano's brother and lieutenant at the time. 
  Reports found in Huallaga state that Vaticano paid off 
prominent military officials in the zone, both in order to land 
small planes on the Campanilla runways as well as for the use of 
the "ducks" to carry the drug in complete safety from one place 
to another. 
  There reportedly exists an Army counterintelligence report 
stating that this Captain De la Puente supplied Vaticano 
helicopters from 1900 at night to carry cocaine paste from 
Campanilla and sometimes even to areas near the Brazilian border 
(Sion). "The duck man" may have been from the Tarapoto Military 
Base or the BCS in Punta Arenas, the reports state. 
  On 20 February of that same year, Vaticano informed the 
Colombian drug trafficker known as "Doctor" that things were 
"still going badly" since the "handling" or movement of the drug 
and payoffs to military personnel had become very expensive. 
  Other military men in the area, probably involved with 
Vaticano during those years, are EP Lieutenants "Mickey," 
"Cahuide," and "Zorro," their code names in Huallaga. 
  As one can see, a great deal remains to be investigated with 
respect to the military aspects of the Vaticano case. 
<H5>  More "Men" </H5>
  The same conversation which Vaticano had with his brother 
Gigante on 24 February 1992 can provide more clues to the 
corruption of members of law enforcement agencies in Huallaga. 
  Witnesses of the conversation in Huallaga say that Gigante 
told Vaticano that the report appearing in different media 
concerning the capture by UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural 
Areas] and the DEA of a small plane carrying 380 kg of cocaine 
paste was not accurate. His brother informed Vaticano that the 
load seized in Pucallpa ("by the men with green eyes" and "the 
men from the red earth") was a sale of 800 kg of cocaine paste 
that they had made to the Colombian drug trafficker Mario. If 
what Gigante had told him was true, what happened to the 
remaining 420 kg? 
  Another piece of information may be related to this fact. 
  It has to do with a conversation which Vaticano had on 5 
March 1992 with a sister of his in Juanjui ("La Calena" or 
Bersabe?). 
  The sister reportedly told him that the seized drug was in 
Juanjui and that the "chief of the place" intended to get it to 
Colombia through Tarapoto. Vaticano reportedly had his sister so 
inform "Calavera" (Humberto Chavez Penaherrera) so that the 
latter, with help from the military, would try to get the 
shipment back. 
<H5>  Campanilla Defense Front </H5>
  In March 1992, Vaticano reportedly ordered, through Gigante, 
that the members of his ring in Campanilla not carry rifles, 
shotguns, or machine guns, evidence compiled in the area 
indicates. 
  However, he excepted handguns and ordered that if they had 
to 
be carried, they should be concealed in clothing. 
  The sources consulted go on to say that Vaticano stressed 
that above all, his men should not carry weapons bearing the 
Peruvian coat of arms and reportedly told Gigante that he 
coordinate with the "engineer," possibly the head of the BCS in 
Punta Arenas. 
  According to different versions given in Huallaga, weapons 
with the Peruvian coat of arms could only belong to the Army. 
  How could Vaticano's men have Army weapons? 
  The explanation given by sources interviewed state that in 
1991, Vaticano promoted the formation of the Campanilla Defense 
Front against the SL terrorists and advised the head of the 
Punta Arenas BCS to give Army weapons to the settlers, many of 
whom belonged to his ring. That year, witnesses say, Vaticano 
decided not to go on paying quotas to the Shining Path. The 
Campanilla Defense Front was one way to stand up to terrorism in 
coordination with the Army. 
  (This was roughly the time of a confrontation of Vaticano's 
band with a Shining Path column. Fifteen terrorists died in the 
battle, people in Campanilla say.) 
  Also according to accounts gathered, Vaticano reminded the 
head of the Punta Arenas BCS, through Gigante, that the 
collection of payments by small aircraft landing on the 
Campanilla strips had been temporarily suspended. 
  Gigante replied that he had already reminded the officer in 
question of that fact, but that the latter went on collecting, 
perhaps, he said, because they were soon to transfer him, the 
informants consulted in Huallaga say. 
  Why did Vaticano prohibit his men from carrying long arms, 
particularly if they bore the Peruvian coat of arms, and why did 
he insist on not collecting payoffs during the early days of 
March 1992? 
  The information available indicates that these measures were 
reportedly taken by Vaticano because of a report published on 29 
February 1992 by the daily newspaper LA REPUBLICA reporting his 
activities in Campanilla and his connections with members of the 
Army. Vaticano reportedly did not want to expose himself by 
revealing the network he had managed to set up in Huallaga for 
his illegal drug trafficking operations. 
<H5>  Police Involved </H5>
  Other sources report serious clues that might compromise PNP 
officials with Vaticano. They allegedly include Major "Che 
Gato," one Colonel Bernedo connected with the escape of the 
trafficker "Mosquito," son of "Mosca Loca" and Captain Rafael 
Lopez, cousin of the first husband of "La Calena," Abel Lopez 
Soria. The latter officer's nickname is "Muneco." 
  It has also been learned that one of the police now 
questioning La Calena is supposedly the one who stole and later 
sold to Vaticano for $5,000 the report containing everything the 
police knew about him up to the time he was captured. 
<H5>  1990: Abundant Proof </H5>
  The arrest of Colombian drug trafficker "Paisa" or "Peter" 
in 
March of 1993, who admitted making more than one "deal" with 
Vaticano, led DINANDRO to make a thorough search of its files 
and records of antidrug operations. 
  An extensive and detailed police report drafted in April 
1993 
concerning Paisa's capture in Caballococha contains the search 
and seizure on 24 July 1990, drafted by members of the PNP's 
Condor Patrol in Campanilla. The report states that the police 
entered Vaticano's house, located approximately 30 meters from 
the laboratory, which was on the right bank of the Huallaga 
River opposite Campanilla. They found the following: seven 
plastic bags, each containing 40 kilos of cocaine paste; two 
plastic bags, each containing 24 kilos of paste; one plastic bag 
containing 16 kilos of paste; two FAL [Armed Forces of 
Liberation] cartridge pouches containing 15 shells each; and an 
FAL rifle with the serial number sanded off. 
  The same report goes on to state that: "The expansion of 
investigations to obtain more evidence relating to Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera in illegal drug trafficking (TID) activities 
yielded information that the latter has relatives with records 
for such activities, Humberto Chavez Penaherrera (aka Calavera) 
in particular. The trafficker was arrested at his house in the 
company of Cirilo Cardenas Mendoza and Ausberto Grandez, along 
with arms and military equipment, communications equipment, in a 
joint EP-PNP operation. The sum of $2,000 was paid to EP Captain 
Alfaro for the return of 04 FAL; he is a known trafficker in 
Alto Huallaga." 
  What is surprising about this report is not so much the 
content of what was found and seized, but the fact that it 
confirms the proximity of the dates. 
  If, on 24 July 1990, a police patrol managed to identify and 
then destroy Vaticano's logistical infrastructure in Campanilla, 
it is surprising that the following year, he should be promoting 
a questionable Defense Front of the People of Campanilla with 
the consent and apparent benevolence of the Army and that, 
during the early months of 1992, based solely on the information 
obtained, he should with impunity be running a vast drug 
trafficking network. 
  There are more than enough reasons for a thorough 
investigation of the possible relations of this drug trafficker 
with prominent military and Police officials in the zone. To 
fail to do so will weaken even further the precarious image 
which our country has abroad in terms of its fight against drug 
trafficking.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirko Lauer] </F>
  [Text] The pamphlet that the Army Press Office (OIE) has 
been circulating against the independent press shows that 
attempts to turn the Armed Forces into a political party are 
becoming increasingly daring. We were well aware that retired 
members of the upper echelons of the Armed Forces were 
deliberately outspoken, but had no idea of the degree to which 
Nicolas Hermoza's [chairman of the Armed Forces Joint command] 
men had become devoted to proselytism. 
  The OIE document does not address the members of the Armed 
Forces as professionals, engaged in the defense of the 
Constitution and the state, but rather real or potential 
political cadres that are being instigated to mobilize those who 
oppose the current regime. Couched in the best Leninist style, 
the tract has a message for insiders, but does not reveal it to 
outsiders. 
  Besides being a pamphlet of proselytism, the OIE document is 
a piece of disinformation for military professionals, which 
caricatures domestic concern for human rights, drug trafficking, 
and precisely the institutionalism of the Armed Forces. In the 
view of the OIE there does not seem to be any difference between 
democratic opposition to Alberto Fujimori and the Shining Path. 
  It is obvious that OIE editors are not interested in 
promoting a debate within its organization, but rather in 
dispelling the possible doubts of its captive audience by 
seeking to provoke in them a mood of paranoia. To this effect 
they invent the idea that the press and public are hostile to 
the Armed Forces as a whole. This is, to say the least, a clumsy 
psychosocial technique. 
  It is not the opposition, but rather high-ranking officials 
from Fujimori's regime who are against trying the most serious 
cases of drug trafficking and violations of human rights in 
civil court. The civil courts are precisely where it is 
acknowledged that the crimes of which a defendant is accused are 
of a nonmilitary nature. To insist on military jurisdiction is 
to do the Armed Forces a disservice. 
  The OIE document seems rather an attempt to involve a 
protective institution in political matters because of some 
individuals' "serious mistakes." In fact, rather than a threat 
against the press (which it certainly is), the document is an 
attempt to impose a certain political line of thought among 
those who wear a uniform on behalf of the nation as a whole. 
  The reiterated allusions to "disloyal people" in the 
pamphlet 
remind one of the secret pacts outside the law that are made by 
some organizations like the Yakuza [Japanese mafia]. The 
officers who at this juncture submit reliable information about 
drug trafficking in the tropical forests are showing in an 
exemplary manner what the sole and top loyalty of a military 
should be: loyalty to the Constitution and to the laws of our 
homeland. 
  The OIE seems to be inviting members of our Armed Forces to 
forget their oaths of allegiance and side with a political 
party. The problem with this lies in the fact that once the 
military begin to get involved in politics, nothing will prevent 
them from increasingly siding with those political options 
offered to them. A leadership that is devoted to making 
officers and the rank-and-file side with Fujimori may end up 
harming the professional, institutional, and democratic feelings 
that prevail in the barracks.

<H5>  Military Party </H5>
  Two weeks ago, Army Commander General [title as published] 
Nicolas de Bari Hermoza gathered a large number of Lima garrison 
officers at the Military School hall and made an aggressive 
speech against those who allegedly are conducting a campaign to 
discredit the Army. Beating on a table with his fists, Hermoza 
stressed that he would not allow the trial of his officers by 
courts of law. Afterward, he repeated the details of Army Press 
Office (OIE) Press Bulletin 02-94, dated 10 February. This 
bulletin states: "The political programs broadcast by the 
television channels and published by the magazines SI, OIGA, and 
CARETAS, and especially the newspaper LA REPUBLICA are 
disseminating biased reports with a clear intention of feigning 
(...) an Army relationship and complicity with drug trafficking." 
  At first sight, the first misinterpretation is that the OIE 
and Hermoza claim that the reports on the links between some 
military officers and drug trafficking are aimed against the 
entire Army. Thus, the military leaders attempt to protect 
themselves behind the Army and resort to solidarity, instead of 
responding to the very solid charges actually raised by Army 
members. 
  The threat to the independent press has been rejected by the 
media and the Journalists Association. In a strong communique 
signed by its dean, Miguel Calderon, the Journalists Association 
pointed out the press' supervisory role and asked President 
Alberto Fujimori to deny the report and punish those who are 
circulating it. 
  As an odd feature, it is worth pointing out that the 
aforementioned nine-page communique--of an entirely political 
content--concludes with a warning remark: "The current BIE 
[Army Press Bulletin] will be read and discussed with all Army 
military personnel."

  [Excerpt] Engineer Victor Joy Way, vice president of the 
CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress], yesterday voiced his 
concern about a document that the Army Public Relations Office 
(OIEP) has sent to the barracks, in which several media--LA 
REPUBLICA among them--are said to be the presumed authors of "a 
smear campaign against the Peruvian Army." 
  Joy Way said he is concerned about everything having to do 
with freedom of expression--despite the fact that it is does not 
deal with his specific area--particularly because during the 
government of engineer Alberto Fujimori, "absolute press freedom 
has been guaranteed, with no restrictions whatsoever." 
  For his part, Oswaldo Sandoval, chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, said that the government guarantees 
unrestricted freedom of expression. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Gladys Bernal Barzola] </F>
  [Text] Atalaya-Ucayali, 16 Mar -- The president of the 
Republic, Alberto Fujimori, admitted here the existence of ties 
between some bad Armed Forces elements and drug trafficking, and 
noted that the courts of law and military courts must not allow 
these crimes to remain unpunished. 
  The president said: "It is not that there are alleged ties. 
There actually are ties. Therefore, the Military Court Supreme 
Council has punished many of the elements involved." 
  Concerning the case involving drug trafficker Demetrio 
Chavez 
Penaherrera ["Vaticano"], the president indicated that the 
courts of law have opened proceedings to investigate the 
existence of any ties the drug trade might have with police and 
the military. 
  Celebrating the opening of another proceeding in the 
military 
courts, the president noted that, had this proceeding not been 
opened, the drug trafficker called "Vaticano" suddenly might 
have been released. 
  After his activities in Atalaya-Ucayali, Fujimori 
emphasized: 
"We will be drastic and inexorable. To this end, however, it is 
necessary for the courts of law and the military courts to work 
in coordination to guarantee that serious crimes like these will 
not remain unpunished." Fujimori was accompanied by Japanese 
Vice Foreign Minister Shozo Azuma [name as published] and other 
Japanese Government officials who delivered a number of 
donations to families afflicted by natural disasters throughout 
our country. 
  Moving on, Fujimori noted that the circulation of an Army 
document stating that the media is engaged in a campaign to 
discredit the Army is part of the freedom existing in our 
country. 
  Fujimori stressed: "Everyone in our country, without 
exception, has a right to voice his or her opinion. Since there 
is freedom of the press, there is also freedom of expression for 
the people and the institutions." 
  In Fujimori's opinion: "This freedom of expression would not 
be allowed in any other country." He mentioned some examples of 
impersonation, involving people or institutions, that would 
warrant lawsuits in other countries. 
  Fujimori noted: "These cases do not happen here because 
there is full freedom of the press and freedom of expression." 
  Within this context, Fujimori was asked about the habeas 
data 
right [by which a citizen can ask a government to supply all 
personal data it has on him or her] included in the 
Constitution, a right that has been described by various 
segments as a threat to freedom of the press. 
  Fujimori stressed: "I agree with championing freedom of the 
press and freedom of expression. The way this habeas data right 
will be regulated, I am sure it will guarantee these freedoms. 
Therefore, those remarks about the existence of threats to these 
freedoms are groundless." 
  Moving on, President Fujimori announced that the draft of a 
letter of intent that was scheduled for signature with the IMF 
one and one-half months ago did not deserve his or the Council 
of Ministers' approval because it changed some of the 
government's goals that had been duly established. 
  These goals include investments in the social field 
involving 
infrastructure improvements in education, health, highways, and 
so on. 
  Fujimori noted: "I am sure the IMF will understand our 
goals. The economic stabilization and pacification goals are 
maintained. Nevertheless, a social program is required. We 
already have explained this social program to (IMF managing 
director) Michel Camdessus who supports it, but we want it 
mentioned in the letter of intent." 
  Another issue discussed by the president involved the 
reorganization of the National Police, especially Dincote 
[National Counterterrorism Directorate], and the recent 
terrorist actions that elicited criticism in the sense that the 
government had lowered its guard, which was ruled out by the 
president. 
  Fujimori said: "This government actually has an effective 
antiterrorist strategy. The attacks do not represent a Shining 
Path revival or an ability to recover. Rather they represent a 
weakness that we will use to our advantage within the same 
strategy." 
  Fujimori admitted that the police are experiencing an 
adjustment process, but explained that it represents an 
adjustment to a new situation in order to enhance effectiveness. 
  Fujimori stressed: "In this field, we will not lower our 
guard an inch. The change of commands has been criticized, but 
the National Police have been strengthened and organized to such 
an extent that they fulfill their duties under any command." 
  The presidential entourage landed at the Atalaya airport, 
changing the initial course to a location in the Andean mountain 
range because of weather problems. 
  In Atalaya, Fujimori visited some hamlets and then went by 
helicopter to the San Jose de Cutivireni base where about 1,400 
Ashaninkas, rescued by a religious mission from the Shining 
Path, have been living since 1991. 
  Of the 1,400 Ashaninkas, of whom 350 are children, 465 
presented themselves voluntarily and 200 sought shelter under 
the Repentance Law recently.

<F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>
  [Text] Before his arrest Demetrio Limonier Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," was the head of the largest drug 
trafficking mafia in Peru, administering like no other drug 
trafficker huge amounts of drugs and dollars. It is estimated 
that he alone sold an average of 60 tonnes of cocaine base per 
year, valued at $900 million. 
  "Vaticano" was the main cocaine base dealer in Peru for the 
Cali cartel, as well as its safest trafficker, as he could 
guarantee the cocaine base shipments to Colombia in small hired 
airplanes that took off from the clandestine landing strips he 
controlled. 
  During its golden times between 1989 and 1992, the Chavez 
Penaherrera empire, whose headquarters were located in 
Campanilla, extended to Uchiza in the south and Saposoa in the 
north. 
  Although his organization became the most powerful one in 
Peru, his gang never attained the nearly absolute power and 
sophisticated structure of the Colombian drug cartels. 
"Vaticano's" organization was in some aspects even a step 
behind some of his Peruvian counterparts. 
  His arrest, which took place in Cali in mid-January, ended 
the belief that Chavez Penaherrera would found the first 
Peruvian drug cartel. This possibility has yet not been ruled 
out, as there are several drug mafias in the country that are 
reportedly in better condition to do what he could not. 
  Meanwhile, the police think that one of the Chavez 
Penaherrera brothers, Elias, aka "Lan Chile," has taken over 
control of the "firm." 
  "El Ministro" 
  Waldo Vargas Arias, a Colombian drug trafficker whose alias 
is "El Ministro," heads the second most important drug 
trafficking "firm" in Peru, and ought to be the main candidate 
for replacing "Vaticano." 
  It is said that Vargas Arias sends more than 40 tonnes of 
cocaine base per year to the Colombian drug "kingpins" with whom 
he deals directly. "El Ministro," however, is far from being 
just a cocaine base dealer, as he manages a network of 
clandestine laboratories. He processes cocaine hydrochloride and 
manages a large network of contacts with Peruvian drug 
traffickers. 
  Without doubt the most profitable activity he has is 
processing and exporting cocaine hydrochloride. More than half 
the national production of cocaine comes from "El Ministro's" 
laboratories. It is estimated that in 1993 nearly 70 tonnes of 
cocaine hydrochloride were produced in the country. 
  Although Waldo Vargas Arias has surpassed "Vaticano" in 
several aspects, it seems that he really does not wish to be on 
top of the rest of the drug kingpins. 
  "`El Ministro' prefers to remain in the jungle managing his 
businesses. It seems that he is not interested in power, given 
that his lifestyle is neither flamboyant nor exaggerated like 
that of `Vaticano,'" a police source said. 
  Vargas Arias' operations center is located in the Lower 
Huallaga region, although he has recently expanded outside San 
Martin Department, near the town of Lagunas, near Yurimaguas. 
  The Cachique Rivera Brothers 
  According to the police, the Cachique Rivera brothers' gang 
is the surest candidate for becoming the first Peruvian drug 
cartel, given its broad network over nearly the entire national 
territory and the different activities in which it participates. 
  These enterprising brothers are not only cocaine base 
middlemen, but have extended their activities to all the 
possible drug trafficking components. 
  They administer a network of laboratories, manufacture 
cocaine hydrochloride, are engaged in precursor traffic, control 
several clandestine landing strips, and have their own fleet of 
small airplanes. 
  They have the largest network of contacts with Peruvian drug 
traffickers, maintain direct contact with the chiefs of the Cali 
cartel, and have some connections in Europe. As if that were 
not enough, they have their own drug money "laundering" system. 
  The Cachique Rivera brothers operate in several zones 
throughout the national territory. They operate in Cajamarca, 
Chiclayo, and Trujillo in the north; in Aguaytia and Pucallpa in 
the east; in Lima and Ica in the center; in Sierra Pasco, 
Palmapampa, Apurimac, and Pichis-Palcazu Valley in the 
mountains; and in Manu in the south. Their operations center is 
located in Aguaytia, a town in Ucayali Department. 
  Their gang is made up of four brothers from Tingo Maria. 
Their names are Adolfo, aka "Alferez"; Abelardo, aka 
"Teniente"; Segundo, aka "Capitan"; and Nicolas, aka "Mayor." 
It is known that Abelardo lives in Cali and is regarded as the 
fiercest of the four. According to the police he conducts their 
"firm's" operations from Colombia, while Segundo surveys the 
normal operation of the "business" in the jungle area. 
  The power of the Cachique Rivera brothers can hardly be 
matched by the other mafias that operate in the country. It is 
estimated that they send nearly 15 tonnes of cocaine 
hydrochloride per year to the Cali cartel, which makes them 
their main supplier. 
  Together with "El Ministro,"the Cachique Rivera brothers are 
the main producers and exporters of cocaine hydrochloride in 
Peru. 
  The Group of Six 
  According to Dinandro [Antidrug Division] and DEA files, a 
special group is made up of six lesser known "firms" which are 
nonetheless just as important given the amount of drug and 
dollars they move. 
  These "firms" are headed by Jorge Alvarez Enriquez, aka 
"Chino Jorge"; Braulio Tafur Alvarado, aka "Tio Braulio"; Juan 
Leguia Manzur, aka "Nino"; Luis Perez, aka "Luco Culon"; Carlos 
Melendez Andrade; and Willer Alvarado Linares. 
  All of them are cocaine base dealers. They collect cocaine 
base and sell it to the Colombian drug traffickers, with whom 
they deal only through middlemen. Their areas of operation are 
located in many settlements in the Huallaga region. 
  Alvarez, Tafur, Perez, and Alvarado operated in Saposoa, 
Juanjui, Uchiza, and in the Lower Huallaga. Leguia and Melendez 
operated in Palmapampa and Manu, which has become a new drug 
trafficking operations center. 
  From this group, the most important traffickers are Leguia, 
Manzur, and Melendez Andrade. They have their own small 
airplanes and access to clandestine landing strips which 
guarantee the transportation of drugs. Among all of them, 
Melendez seems to have more advantages than the others, as he 
controls some laboratories in which he manufactures washed coca 
paste and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  It is estimated that all these firms send nearly 15 tonnes 
of 
drugs per year to Colombia. 
  The Rest 
  Other less important gangs, but which also deal in large 
amounts of drugs, are made up of families that operate in 
different parts of the country. 
  According to the police, the brothers Luis and Jorge 
Cardenas 
Guzman, aka the "Mosquitos"--sons of the well-known drug 
trafficker "Mosca Loca"--operate in Bellavista and Iquitos. The 
brothers Luis and Javier Lopez, aka "Crespo I" and "Crespo II," 
operate in Saposoa and Campanilla. 
  Eliseo Alvarado Perez, aka "Champa," father of Willer 
Alvarado Linares, is known as one of the "bosses" of Aucayacu, 
and the Julca Urrello brothers--one of whose members was 
arrested together with "Vaticano" in Cali--operate in Ica. 
  There are many other traffickers who are known only by their 
aliases: "Cristo," "Tolima," "Azul," "Tio Poderoso," "Bigote," 
"Charapa," "Pelo Duro," "Galleta," and "Clavo." These are just 
some of the aliases registered by the police in its files, which 
grow every day with the names of criminals who aspire to one day 
follow after "Vaticano," who is currently in prison.

  [Text] Police sources have told EXPRESO that the strict 
control applied since the middle of last year on the sale of 
chemical precursors for cocaine has caused their prices to 
increase 16-fold. 
  This is why trafficking gangs are now hijacking the trucks 
that transport these chemicals. The police have reported that 
20 to 25 tons of sulfuric acid have already been stolen by 
criminal gangs. 
  The police source said that links have been established 
between the gangs that attack these trucks and trafficking gangs. 
  Since the middle of last year there has been close 
coordination between the Industry Ministry, the National Customs 
Administration Superintendency, and the Antidrug Division 
(Dinandro) over the importation of chemical products. 
  In the past few weeks Dinandro agents discovered that two 
gangs are hijacking trucks that transport chemical products used 
to prepare cocaine base. It has been established that the 
stolen chemicals were sold to trafficking gangs that manufacture 
cocaine. 
  Several attacks on trucks transporting sulfuric acid from 
Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] were reported 
recently in Cerro de Pasco and La Oroya. 
  The police have said that traffickers are paying $16 per 
liter for sulfuric acid when its normal price is $1. 
  The police are trying to break this connection between 
common 
criminals and traffickers in an effort to prevent this from 
becoming a new method to escape police control on chemical 
products used to manufacture drugs in Peru.

  [Text] Coca is not consumed where it is produced. This was 
the popular belief until statistics proved it wrong. In the 
coca producing zones in Peru, the number of consumers is 
gradually increasing. Thus, the myth has ended. 
  An epidemiology poll on drug consumption conducted by the 
Cedro [Information and Education Center to Prevent Drug Abuse] 
in Iquitos, Tarapoto, and Tingo Maria, has found that 8 percent 
of those polled said they had tried marijuana sometime in their 
lives, while 25.1 percent said they knew of the substance. At 
the national level, marijuana consumption is estimated at 7.8 
percent and those who know about it at 24.7 percent. 
  Regarding cocaine base, 14.7 percent of city dwellers in the 
jungle regions said they use it. This is way over the 5.6 
percent registered at the national level. 
  The same trend was found when people were asked if they knew 
the substance: 37.3 percent of those polled in those cities said 
yes while at the national level showed 19.5 percent. 
  On the other hand, 1.7 percent of those asked said they had 
tried cocaine at least once, which is under the 2 percent at the 
national level. 
  Also 7.8 percent of those living in the jungle regions said 
they knew about cocaine. This is below the average at the 
national level (8.2 percent). 
  The poll showed that 26.9 percent said getting marijuana was 
easy while 57.7 percent said it was difficult. 
  Regarding cocaine base, 30.8 percent said it was easy to get 
while 53 percent said it was difficult. Regarding cocaine, 26.4 
percent said it was easy to get and 53.6 percent said it was 
difficult. 
  More than one fourth of the people living in the jungle 
regions have more or less free access to illegal substances. 
This does not mean they use it, but it shows in one way or 
another they know about the links between the community and drug 
trafficking. 
  The Cedro poll is interesting because it shows that 51.3 
percent of the people in that region said that consumption was 
caused by factors related to individual drug users (personality, 
emotional problems, inability to face daily problems, lack of 
family communication, etc.). 
  A worrisome 34.2 percent said consumption was prompted by 
factors related to pleasure and being lured into addiction. 
They thus considered that consumers were not directly 
responsible. 
  In conclusion, 4.6 percent of the Peruvian Amazon region 
inhabitants understand that consumption is caused by factors 
unrelated to individuals--like fashion, curiosity, poor choice 
of friends, and so on. 
  There are reasons for an increase in consumption, but the 
problem lies in determining which of these reasons is the most 
significant. Many minors are handling large amounts of money, 
given to them by their parents: So they may squander it on drugs. 
  The experts say another reason paradoxically involves the 
gradual withdrawal of traffickers, seeking new centers of coca 
production. 
  Cities like Tocache, Uchiza, and Juanjui--which used to be 
trading and operation centers for drug money--have become ghost 
towns where the inhabitants ``drown'' their sorrows in drugs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan </F>
Provincial CPC Committee, by TA KUNG PAO staff reporter; date 
and place not given: "Pu Chaozhu Answers Questions Raised by TA 
KUNG PAO Reporter"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [TA KUNG PAO] There is a rumor circulating abroad that 
Yunnan Province is beset with the problems of drug cultivation 
and trafficking. What is actually the true situation? 
  [Pu] Yunnan Province has a long border. Intermarriage is 
common among people living in the frontiers which are not 
separated by big rivers, and it is impossible to surround them 
with barbed wire. These people are relatives of each other. 
For a long time, people living inside and outside the frontiers 
have lived together in peace and have been law-abiding on the 
whole. However, there are also difficulties. Outside our 
borders, people grow 1 million mu of opium poppies. So long as 
they have a bumper harvest of opium poppies, we will have bad 
luck. For our part, the Yunnan provincial government firmly 
bans the cultivation, trafficking, and selling of drugs. Even 
dozens of mu or a piece of land sown to opium poppies will be 
promptly weeded out as soon as they are discovered. Last year 
over 100 mu of opium poppies were rooted out. However, banning 
cultivation of opium poppies does not solve the problem. As 
long as you gaze at the places across the frontier line you 
stand on, a sea of red opium poppies will meet your eyes. 
Making use of Yunnan as a thoroughfare for drug trafficking, 
drug trading groups ship drugs to Guangzhou and Hong Kong via 
Kunming. We also firmly ban and crack down on such activities. 
Last year, we arrested more than 3,000 people and dealt with 
some of the cases based on solid evidence according to law. Drug 
traffickers who are arrested will certainly be dealt with 
according to law, be they from other provinces or outside the 
borders. While strengthening border customs inspection, we rely 
mainly on the joint defense of the people, the Army, and the 
police and form a gigantic net so that there is no escape for 
drug traffickers. Last year, we seized and confiscated drugs 
totaling some five tonnes, or 3.5 tonnes of heroin and 1.5 
tonnes of opium. However, according to our calculation, this was 
only the tip of the iceberg. The traffickers succeeded in 
smuggling out most of their drugs. As long as there are drug 
markets abroad, it is difficult to solve the problem. Last 
year, the number of drug cases dropped but that of major cases 
increased, and there were even cases of armed smuggling and 
escorting of drugs. This is a complicated international 
problem. Now we are seeking cooperation with international 
anti-drug organizations to jointly crack down on drug trading 
activities. In a word, on no account does Yunnan grow and 
traffic drugs. The province firmly bans drugs. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Guangzhou, 14 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Last 
year, the Guangzhou City police seized 145.3 kg of heroin and 
over 3.9 kg of "ice" and investigated and punished over 6,500 
people involving in drug trafficking and drug abuse. 
  In reporting to the city people's congress, the Guangzhou 
City Public Security Bureau said that it also seized 1,425 guns 
of various kinds (of which 57 were designed for military use) 
and 3,237 bullets last year. [passage omitted] 
  A Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau report says that the 
social order situation in Guangzhou remains quite grim. The 
number of serious criminal cases is increasing steadily, the 
damage resulting from organized crime is increasing day by day, 
and some criminal gangs are becoming underworld societies. 
[passage omitted] 
  Deputy Bureau Director Wang Long said that, this year, the 
Guangzhou police will make great efforts to improve Guangzhou's 
social order and will curb the momentum in the rising number of 
major and serious cases, will send more policemen to patrol the 
streets, will arm traffic policemen so that they can take care 
of both traffic and social order, and will strengthen the 
management of people from other localities and mobilize the 
residents to set up "small security zones" to promote the 
comprehensive improvement of social order.

"Guangxi Government Chairman and Vice Chairman Reveal That 
Guangxi Employed an Additional 700 Policemen To Fight Smuggling 
Last Year and Seized 300 Guns and Some Drugs"] 
  [Excerpt] Deputies to the National People's Congress, 
Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
Government, and Vice Chairman Lei Yu revealed here today: Last 
year, the Guangxi Government employed an additional 700 
policemen especially to cope with gunrunners and drug 
traffickers, seizing more than 900 kg of drugs and some 300 guns 
and arresting about 300 drug traffickers. This year, the 
Guangxi Government will continue to crack down severely on drug 
smuggling and trafficking in close cooperation with the Hong 
Kong police. [passage omitted] 
  Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News 
Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic 
Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question, 
Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and 
1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use 
of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry 
out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has 
always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements. 
Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700 
personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers 
and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and 
about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders), 
and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs 
comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say: 
We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong 
police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain 
unchanged in the days to come. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The KINH DOANH VA PHAP LUAT (Business and Law) 
journal has recently reported that goods smuggling has been 
increasing since early this year. Concerned agencies recently 
detected two out of a group of eight foreign cargo ships 
carrying smuggled goods. 
  Drug trafficking has also been on the increase in recent 
days. In the first two months of this year, the authorities 
uncovered 17 cases of trafficking and confiscated 450 kg of 
opium and 0.72 kg of heroin. The most serious was the smuggling 
of 129 kg of opium by cadres of the Dien Bien goldsmith shop in 
Lai Chau Province. 
  It is noteworthy that the manufacturing and trading of fake 
goods done in meticulous ways are also widespread. Police 
nationwide have so far detected and dealt with 2,700 cases. 
This is a new challenge for responsible agencies in the 
struggle against smuggling.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Boumaza: "Drugs: The `Kenna' </F>
Connection"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] A small Medellin will grow up provided God grants it 
life. The twists and turns that lead to the route that kif 
[North African variety of cannabis] takes, because, let's face 
it, there is a route, and speaking only of kif, that light but 
oh so dangerous "zatla," is obviously hard to track. This 
illegal product, illegal because it is extremely deadly, has 
ruined and is still ruining many people: those who use it and 
rich men or sharks whose teeth are growing increasingly longer 
and sharper. 
  Guelma--In Guelma, as in all of Algeria's cities, drugs slip 
insidiously into circles of innocent youth; drugs "produce" 
lifeless bodies sapped of energy and, abetted by a drug habit, 
these will be lost forever. 
  Do you need to be clever to know that the item in question, 
this curse, that all of our evils in this area come from the 
west, from Morocco, to be precise? This is unquestionably true, 
some would tell us, though now, once you are "trapped," you can 
no longer escape and you go to get some in that neighboring 
country, as, for example, the young Guelma resident did who went 
by taxi from Oran to look for 50 kg of kif and will be sentenced 
to three years in jail. Besides, we have learned from a 
well-informed source that among the numerous routes drugs take, 
these come from Oujda to Tlemcen, where they are distributed on 
the south side of the Atlas [Mountains], to south of the Sahara, 
and even in Libya. The "quota" coming from Oujda to Oran is sold 
in the northern part of the country, in Tunisia, and even goes 
to Italy. 
  However, experts familiar with this milieu have told us of a 
network (a fairly complex one) that extends its tentacles 
through certain cities in the eastern part of the country, among 
others. 
  In fact, Morocco is no longer cited but rather at least two 
villages, the first not far from Annaba, the second not far from 
Skikda, where the Indian hemp or poppy reportedly blows in the 
wind. We have also heard it said that the cultivation of this 
accursed plant is making life enjoyable for certain madmen quite 
close to Guelma, somewhere in the mountains that surround the 
town. This plant is said to have two different leaves, one being 
"chahba" or red, supposedly "female" and said to produce good 
kif, the other "kahla" or black, the male leaf. To make a drug 
out of it, the recipe is a simple one: once dried, the leaves 
are reduced to a powder; using tea (a liquid), you mix the 
powder in it to make a paste, which when pressure is applied to 
it using an iron, becomes hard. Then, with the steam from a 
couscous pot making it malleable as desired, it is cut into 
small portions to be sold. 
  In the town of Guelma, several "wholesalers" of the stuff 
are 
running wild. Dealers, whose ages range from 16 to 26, take care 
of the retail trade. Each neighborhood has one or several 
suppliers of "zatla," "kemia," or "kenna" ("the sister-in-law"). 
According to what the buyer has in his pocket, there are 
differently priced lumps: 50, 100, 200 Algerian dinars, etc. 
Selling drugs in a cafe is not a business, we were told, it is 
selling your skin one day or the next. So sales are made in 
secret, anywhere at all, wherever you meet people; all you need 
to do is know one of the people involved to make contact with 
one of them. 
  In any event, when night falls, several street corners and 
small squares become places where drugs are smoked, there are 
"mahchachas" which, in addition to a "joint" or a "sheikh" or a 
"kenna" are supplemented with wine, "rai," or "chaabi." Even in 
this rotten world, you cannot escape hoaxes, which then become 
the height of the ridiculous. 
  Indeed, there is also ersatz "zatla," which is made with gum 
benzoin (jaoui), among other things. It is reduced to a power 
and mixed with tea, which produces, so you could make the 
mistake, a paste that is absolutely similar to the "sheet" of 
kif; it is only when you burn it that you discover the hoax. 
  As for tranquilizers, the list of which is a long one, they 
are also good if they are not taken in private, neat; using 
medicinal herbs, whose names and usefulness God only knows, you 
make a "good drug" to fight off the dreariness of the days, of 
reality. There are tranquilizers and other psychotropic drugs 
called "6-15," "Nivatran," "Diazi," ``Nitrazipan," "Temesta," 
etc. 
  So while our elders squabble over just achieving a supreme 
"high," young people "beat it," not in Babor Australia but in 
hell. Besides, the guides who take you there are no less 
numerous or intelligent. 
  Chemists with worldwide reputations may be small-time 
handymen compared with these sorcerers who come up with many 
well-stuffed, diabolical "recipes." To see what this is like, 
let us quote some of them. They are not to be manufactured, of 
course. 
  You take two or three medicines, such as Upsa 500, PH8, 
Diazipan, etc., which you pulverize, that you then mix with 
another one in the form of a syrup, Neo-codion, for example, 
preferably a mentholated syrup. Next, you put all of this into a 
small bag, which you compress using an iron. That is enough to 
come close to suicide or carry it out. It is a recipe that does 
not cost more than 100 Algerian dinars but is sold for between 
five to six times as much. Here is another method: some "henne" 
from Ghardaia because it is not flavored, together with honey, 
tea, or caramelized sugar. Once again this is ersatz "zatla."

  [Text] The Interior Ministry's Antinarcotics Department 
yesterday launched a large-scale campaign in the valleys of 
south Sinai. Some 42 poppy farms, 50 kg of bango [Egyptian 
slang for hashish], and 15 kg of dry poppy seeds were discovered 
and seized in the north of the Saint Catherine district. 
  In a campaign involving the Public, Central Security, and 
Armed Forces, 27 cannabis and poppy farms were discovered in the 
south of Saint Catherine. For the first time, the troops 
involved in the campaigns sprayed the illegal poppy and cannabis 
farms from the air. Large narcotic plantations throughout the 
area were sprayed. Some 106 poppy plantations were found in the 
two raids. 
  The troops are continuing their clampdown on drug farms in 
the region.

reported that a police force from the antinarcotics bureau of 
Zahlah District today raided the house of Shakir 'Umran 
al-Buraydi, 30, who is from 'Irsal but currently resides in Qabb 
Ilyas. During the sweep, al-Buraydi opened fire at the patrol, 
killing three policemen on the spot. They are Mustafa Faris, 
Shawqi 'Awn, and Samir al- Mu'allim. Mu'tazz Abu-Fayd was 
seriously wounded. 
  An Internal Security force under the command of Colonel 
Hasan 
Hallaq, commander of the al-Biqa' military zone, with the 
support of a Lebanese Army force, arrived immediately after the 
crime and began sweeps in Qabb Ilyas. Roadblocks were also set 
up in the area by the Internal Security Forces and the Army.

  [Text] Regarding the news report about the crime

of the Judicial Police Force dead and a fourth wounded, we have 
just received the following report: 
  Following inquiries, the security forces succeeded in 
discovering the area where the criminal had taken refuge. They 
carried out a series of raids and encirclements that lasted more 
than two hours. With the security forces completely surrounding 
his hideout, the criminal opened fire on them. They responded 
in kind, forced him to surrender, seized the weapon he used in 
his crime, and transported him under armed guard to the Shtawrah 
Police Station, where Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij was 
supervising the pursuit along with the al-Biqa governor and 
several security forces commanders. 
  The security forces handed the criminal over to Judge Khalid 
Hammud, the government's assistant delegate to the Military 
Tribunal. Judge Hammud immediately began interrogating the 
suspect. 
  Minister Mirhij, meanwhile, left for the Sa'd Nayil township 
to offer his condolences to the family of martyred Sergeant 
Mustafa Faris.

  [Text] Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar addressed a news 
conference and disclosed that India, through its agents, is 
smuggling chemicals used in the processing of heroin into tribal 
areas of Pakistan and that the Federal Investigation Agency has 
seized 92 kg of a chemical, sufficient for producing 736 kg of 
heroin, in a raid on the Atari-Lahore Samjhauta Express train. 
Giving details of this Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan, the 
minister called upon the international community to use its 
influence to check India from indulging in such shameful 
activities. 
  There can be no difference of opinion on the question of 
India's hostility toward Pakistan. It has not accepted Pakistan 
from the very beginning, and that is why it never misses any 
opportunity to malign Pakistan on any issue. In the past too, a 
large quantity of chemical used in heroin processing was seized 
from the Samjhauta Express train, but the parties involved in 
this trade later tried to cover it up as a chemical openly sold 
in the Akbari market. Now that it has been fully proved that 
India is smuggling chemicals into Pakistani territory, including 
its tribal areas, not only through the Samjhauta Express but 
also through its agents, the government should take stringent 
measures to check this smuggling. It should also take video of 
such seizures and show it to the international community with 
documentary proof thereof, so the world can see the black side 
of the Indian character and realize to what extent India can go 
to fulfill its unholy ambitions and abominable designs.

<F P=106> [Article by Farah Rafi: "Drug Smuggling Must Be Stopped"] </F>
  [Text] Humans have used narcotics prepared from leaves, 
grains, and flowers from natural plants for centuries. The 
practice of preparing and selling on a commercial scale started 
with the advent of the capitalist system. The investors get so 
involved in their desire for making profits that they do not 
even think that their trade is like poison to human health. 
  The capitalist system started during the British era. They 
formed the East India Company for trade which took over Bihar 
and Bengal in 1757 and gradually controlled the whole of India. 
It started cultivation of poppy used for making opium. The 
British sold opium to the Chinese people and they became 
addicted to it. Their goal was to get the Chinese addicted to 
opium and then get silver in exchange. They continued to sell 
opium to the Chinese for this purpose and became rich by getting 
silver in exchange. They used to post attractive posters to sell 
opium and to increase the desire to purchase this fatal poison. 
Slowly the number of drug addicts in China increased. The 
Chinese, seeing this situation, rebelled against the British. 
This is known as the Opium War. 
  A similar situation was created in America. The Christians 
under pressure did impose restrictions on making, selling, and 
drinking liquor. However, it caused the start of smuggling and 
many persons got involved in it. This work could not be done 
without the help of the government. The investors involved in 
this trade made the officials and agents partners in it and 
smuggling by ships and airplanes began to prosper. This trade 
has expanded even to Pakistan now. We have been reading in the 
newspapers that when the Afghans came to Pakistan because of the 
Soviet-Afghanistan war, they brought opium and heroin with them. 
They sowed poppy in the northern part of Sarhad and began to 
obtain opium from it. Not only this, they began to make heroin 
from opium later. This was used in our country and has grown to 
a dangerous proportion now. The truth is opposed to it. The 
people in Sarhad and Peshawar had not permitted the Afghans to 
cross the border. How could they let them grow poppy? It was the 
locals who had started cultivating poppy there and gradually the 
drug trade began to expand. Strong voices were raised against 
this trade under every government. Seminars were held and 
rallies taken out. The persons who were arrested for being 
involved in this trade were not Afghan refugees. Similarly, when 
"Operation cleanup" was carried out in Sohrab Goth in Karachi, 
the people who were arrested there were not related to Afghan 
refugees. Therefore, it is unfair to say that Afghan refugees 
brought drugs to Pakistan. The drug trade was carried out on a 
small scale in Pakistan in the past, however, the hunger of 
these traders was not satisfied and they started to smuggle 
drugs abroad. In this context, high officials cooperate with 
them and they also became rich because billions of dollars are 
involved in heroin smuggling. The smuggling business created the 
"drug mafia." 
  Drugs from Pakistan are smuggled to the United States, Saudi 
Arabia, and several other countries. The United States has been 
putting pressure on Pakistan since the end of the Afghan war to 
stop drug smuggling. The Saudi leaders are also demanding the 
same thing. In our own country, seminars, meeting, rallies, and 
special anti-drug days are being observed. However, all this is 
useless. 
  If we look around ourselves, we will see people with sheets 
wrapped around their heads using drugs at bus stops, parks, and 
streets in large numbers. Around schools and colleges various 
edibles will have opium or heroin mixed in them. No one is there 
to catch the culprits. At times, there are news reports of 
arrests of addicts and drug dealers, however, the whole business 
starts all over again just like the old adage, "the 
story-tellers write about China." The drug addicts are admitted 
into hospitals and control their habit to an extent, but when 
they leave the hospital, various people catch them and make them 
addicts again. 
  The government must stop heroin production and it is 
necessary to stop growing poppy. The farmers who grow poppy 
should be encouraged to grow grains and fruits to increase our 
agricultural production. In addition, drug smugglers should be 
levied with heavy fines and given exemplary punishments. They 
should not be let go just by paying fines so that they start 
their business again and they get used to the habit of "paying 
the bribe and buying freedom."

  [Text] Peshawar (Staff Reporter)--Mohammed Hanif son of 
Itaul Rehman has exposed the black deeds of his uncle who sends 
naive villagers with heroin to Saudi Arabia falsely promising 
them wealth and jobs. The Narcotics Police had presented the 
accused in Magistrate Afsar Khan's court after initial 
questioning and the accused admitted in the court that his uncle 
Rehman was a fisherman in Karachi until recently. His luck 
changed and he went to Saudi Arabia and earned money as a driver 
in addition to working as a fisherman. The accused further said 
that his uncle upon his return home started the business of 
sending people abroad. He had already sent nine villagers to 
Arab countries. His uncle had arranged for 19 persons including 
his nephew to go abroad. He charged each person 30,000 rupees. 
The accused said that his uncle had prepared him to go with the 
other persons. One sack full of floating balls used for fishing 
were given to every two persons to carry with them. The names of 
these persons were written on those sacks to help pass the 
customs check points. His other uncle also had come to see them 
all off. At the airport the floating balls were found to be 
filled with heroin and all of these people were arrested. The 
accused said that they were innocent and that his uncle had 
deceived all the passengers as he owned that heroin.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Major Narco-Smugglers Being Arrested--Nasir </F>
Babar"] 
  [Text] Islamabad (JANG Correspondent)--The government has 
announced it is taking organized and comprehensive action to end 
the planting of poppy, stopping its movement, and to eradicate 
drug abuse. Under this plan, arrests of major drug smugglers 
around the country have started. This was announced by Maj. Gen. 
(Retd.) Nasirullah Khan Babar, federal minister of drug control, 
in a press conference here on Sunday. High officials of the 
Narcotics Control Board were also present. The minister said 
that arrests of the "big fish" in order to stop drug smuggling 
have started. Three major smugglers, Umar Khan Parvez, Iqbal 
Durrani, and Ghulam Mohammed, that were sought by the U.S. 
Government have been arrested. He said that two new agencies 
have been established to curb drugs. A policy review board has 
been established under the leadership of the home minister. The 
states home ministers, the four home secretaries, and health 
ministers of the four states will be included in that board. In 
addition a national committee to curb drugs is also established. 
It will be chaired by the federal home secretary. The four 
inspectors general of police, chief secretary of F.C. Rangers, 
Coast Guard, and heads of other law and order agencies will be 
members of this committee. He said that a major bill to give the 
death penalty to drug smugglers and to confiscate their property 
will be introduced in the National Assembly. The law ministry is 
reviewing its draft. This will also be sent to state governments 
for their input. He said that the government actions have 
resulted in the reduction of the poppy growing areas from 80,000 
acres to 15,000 acres. The production of poppy has come down 
from 800 metric tons to 150 metric tons. He said that in Sarhad 
there are only two places--Karo Darra and Naya Darra--where 
poppy is still cultivated. The home minister said that the 
Pakistan Government has sealed the Afghanistan border fully to 
stop the entry of drugs from Afghanistan. It is expected that 
the situation will improve now. A new program to stop drug 
production in tribal areas has started. Under this program, 
loans will be issued to tribals for starting industries. The 
banking system is being amended for this purpose. In addition, 
12 laboratories used for making heroin has been destroyed. While 
discussing the government's activities, he said that the 
government agencies have confiscated 398 kilograms of opium, 
1,965 kilograms of heroin, 61,755 kilograms of hashish during 
these 100 days. He said that a new comprehensive law, which will 
be a composition of the three drug-related laws, will soon be 
passed. The home minister said in answer to a question that the 
CIA report [not further specified] has helped in arrests of some 
major smugglers, and six of them have been handed over into U.S. 
custody. While discussing Qazi Hussein Ahmed's accusation, the 
home minister said that some drug smugglers were indeed present 
in the former Assembly, however, no member in the present 
Assembly has been identified as having relations with the Drug 
Mafia. He said that when the investigation is completed, we will 
learn which Assembly members have contacts with the Drug Mafia. 
Action will be taken against whoever is found to be involved in 
the drug trade. He said that it is very embarrassing for us that 
every Friday two or three Pakistanis are beheaded in Saudi 
Arabia. Screening machines are being placed in all airports to 
investigate and make the system of personal search of all 
Pakistanis going abroad more effective. In answer to a question, 
the home minister said that the list of drug smugglers has been 
given to the Senate committee and 15 of the smugglers have been 
arrested. The remainder on the list will be arrested soon. While 
talking informally with the reporters during lunch after the 
press conference, Home Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Nasirullah 
Babar said that the federal government had decided to give the 
right to vote to all adults in tribal areas. Under the new law, 
FATA [Federally Administered Territories] will become totally a 
part of Pakistan and all our national laws will be imposed 
there. This will significantly reduce the number of crimes and a 
new chapter of progress in the tribal area will be opened.

Dutch citizen have been charged with the unlawful production and 
possession of opiates and psychotropic substances, the district 
investigation office told CTK today. 
  The two men, aged 43 and 55, are now in police custody. If 
found guilty they face eight to fifteen years' imprisonment. 
  The price of the heroin was 60,000 German marks. The Dutch 
citizen is probably a Czech emigre who regularly visits the 
Czech Republic, the investigator said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Seges, director of the Criminal Law </F>
Department at the General Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak 
Republic, by Juraj Handzo; place and date not given: "Shall We 
Be Able To Cope With Mafias?; Law on Combating Organized Crime 
Being Drafted"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, the government's Legislative 
Council approved with comments the draft of a law on uncovering 
and punishing the most serious, especially organized, forms of 
crime. The draft has been prepared by the General Prosecutor's 
Office of the Slovak Republic. We discussed the purpose and the 
contents of the new law with one of its authors, Ivan Seges, 
LL.D., director of the Criminal Law Department at the General 
Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak Republic. 
  [Handzo] Could you briefly characterize the contents of the 
law under preparation? 
  [Seges] In drafting the law, we strove to have it contain, 
on the greatest scale possible, such elements as would make it 
possible to vigorously crack down on manifestations of organized 
crime. The draft consists, in fact, of two parts. The first 
concerns legal means that make it possible to uncover attempts 
at an unlawful legalization of income stemming from serious 
criminal activity--that is, the so-called laundering of dirty 
money. The second part defines legal means and procedures that 
would make it possible to expose and document serious criminal 
activity in a way that could be used as evidence in court [s 
procesnou posobnostou]. The course of action by the bodies 
involved in criminal proceedings has until now been formal, in a 
certain way, so that findings by the criminal police that were 
not obtained by the set procedures could not be used as evidence 
in court. 
  [Handzo] What is the purpose of the proposed legal means? 
  [Seges] We would like to break through the principle that is 
valid now, according to which it is possible to start collecting 
evidence, for it to be recognized in court, only after criminal 
prosecution has been formally initiated. In the case of listed 
criminal acts (which are enumerated in the draft law), the 
bodies involved in criminal proceedings should be permitted to 
collect evidence that will be recognized in court before the 
initiation of criminal prosecution. These bodies should be 
endowed with such powers as would allow them to investigate 
effectively, in a way that will be recognized in court, when 
their crime-solving experience and other indications suggest 
that they are confronted with organized crime, even if they do 
not avail themselves of findings signaling a specific criminal 
act. 
  [Handzo] Could the application of legal means permitting the 
start of investigations in the event of a mere suspicion not 
constitute encroachment upon basic human rights in certain cases? 
  [Seges] The draft law makes it possible for bodies involved 
in criminal proceedings to secure evidence, in the case of 
listed (enumerated) criminal acts, without there being a formal 
resolution on the initiation of criminal prosecution. 
Therefore, should a charge be raised, the effects of the start 
of criminal prosecution would retroactively authorize even the 
deployment of operational technical devices 
[operativno-technickych prostriedkov], telephone tapping, or the 
use of a secret agent operating under an assumed identity 
(alias), who would penetrate into the criminal environment with 
the aim of obtaining evidence. 
  It is self-evident that, in view of this being a very 
serious 
encroachment upon citizens' civil rights and liberties, all of 
these means could be used only with the consent of the judge or 
prosecutor. Opponents of this regulation argue that it is 
anticonstitutional or that it restricts basic human rights. 
However, the Constitution expressly states that these rights 
can be restricted by law if the interest of society so requires. 
And it is in the interest of society that the relevant bodies 
be provided with the possibility to crack down effectively on 
organized crime. No one is going to restrict the rights of 
decent people.... 
  [Handzo] The specific criminal acts authorizing the 
application of the aforesaid legal means are listed in the draft 
law. Which criminal acts are involved? 
  [Seges] This would apply, for example, to the criminal acts 
of terrorism, sabotage, counterfeiting and altering money and 
securities, general endangerment, endangering the safety of an 
aircraft or a civilian vessel, unauthorized armament, and other 
grievous criminal acts. Apart from this, we propose a provision 
under which, in certain cases and with the prosecutor's consent, 
the law would also apply to deliberate criminal acts, for which 
the minimum sentence is five years of deprivation of freedom, 
provided the circumstances of the case justify the assumption 
that the act had been committed by an organized group, as 
defined by this law. 
  [Handzo] Let us return to the issue of "dirty-money 
laundering." What will the adoption of the law mean in 
practice, from that point of view? 
  [Seges] The draft provides for several basic principles, the 
application of which would help expose attempts at the unlawful 
legalization of income stemming from serious criminal activity. 
First of all, it lays down the obligation for juridical persons 
and entrepreneurs to report facts suggesting the existence of 
such activities. At the same time, the anonymity in relation to 
financial institutions should be eliminated in a certain way, to 
make it possible to identify people carrying out suspicious 
banking operations. Financial institutions should be placed 
under the obligation to report to the Prosecutor's Office or to 
the Slovak Republic Police Corps not only instances of suspected 
legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity 
but also cash deposits and withdrawals exceeding a certain sum 
(for example, 100,000 Slovak korunas). The second principle is 
that juridical persons and entrepreneurs are obliged to refuse 
to perform acts (such as the conclusion of a contract) that 
could, without doubt, be conducive to the legalization of income 
stemming from serious criminal activity. Furthermore, the draft 
law sets out the right, in the event of any suspicious 
transactions, to ascertain the origin of the property that these 
transactions concern. The last proposed provision is that a 
citizen or an organization that helps uncover attempts at the 
legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity 
is entitled to a reward in the amount of 10 percent of the 
uncovered sum. Naturally, all of these provisions would be 
applied also to machinations associated with the privatization 
process. 
  [Handzo] Does the draft law also provide for manifestations 
of organized crime associated with the criminal act of the 
unauthorized production and possession of narcotic and 
psychotropic substances and toxins--that is, drug-trafficking? 
  [Seges] As we know, existing legislation did not make it 
possible, in fact, to combat more effectively these expressions 
of organized crime. If a person was found to carry such a 
substance and wanted to avoid criminal prosecution, often this 
person only had to say that it was for his or her own need. The 
draft law contains provisions under which it would be possible 
to prosecute criminally everyone possessing these substances, 
regardless of whether he keeps them for his own needs or for 
someone else. Of course, it is up to the relevant specialized 
bodies to assess in each specific case, considering the quantity 
of the seized addictive substance, whether the person in 
question could keep it for his or her own use. 
  [Handzo] What makes the struggle against organized crime 
exceptionally difficult is the inadequate protection of 
witnesses. Does the proposed law provide for any changes in this 
regard? 
  [Seges] The provision of essential protection to witnesses 
is one of the pillars of the draft we propose. Intimidation of 
potential witnesses is one of the common practices of organized 
crime. The protection of witnesses should be secured in three 
ways. First, under strictly defined conditions, the law will 
make it possible for them to remain anonymous; second, on the 
basis of a provision in the law, it will be possible to question 
them during court proceedings with the public excluded; and, 
finally, when agents are concerned, their true identity will not 
be revealed even during criminal proceedings.

  [Text] As a result of investigations going on since 
February, a drug ring has now been cracked in Korneuburg [Lower 
Austria]. Between the beginning of 1992 and the discovery of 
the drug consumers and dealers, the main culprits in Vienna and 
in Korneuburg district probably sold about 22.5 kg of cannabis 
resin at a price of 100 schillings per gram. Three suspects 
were arrested at least temporarily. 
  A major ring of heroin dealers has been cracked by the 
Innsbruck police; eight people have been arrested so far. It 
has been proven that the suspects, who are between 18 and 24, 
have taken many "shopping trips" to Zurich. The suspects, most 
of whom are addicts, appear to have brought several kilos of 
heroin to Innsbruck and sold it there in 1992 and 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: "Drug Ring Controlled From Prison"] </F>
  [Text] Tips from police in Ecuador led to the unfolding of 
Denmark's biggest cocaine case yet. The chief suspect was 
arrested in his prison cell in Vridsloselille. 
  From his cell in the state penitentiary in Vridsloselille, a 
sentenced Colombian cocaine smuggler was controlling a drug ring. 
  This was learned from statements made by couriers who have 
been apprehended and are currently in custody in Copenhagen and 
Amsterdam. Narcotics Police Chief Erik Bjorn believed this to be 
the most extensive cocaine operation ever uncovered in Denmark. 
  Some 45 kilos of South American cocaine was smuggled into 
Denmark as well as via Denmark into the Netherlands inside 
bowling balls, EDP equipment, books, and hollow rope. A 
conservative estimate suggests that a shipment of that size--an 
enormous quantity in Danish terms--has the value of between 150 
and 200 million kroner when sold on the street in small packets 
to addicts. 
  Nine couriers and middlemen have been arrested in Denmark 
and 
the Netherlands in the last month--seven Danes and two 
Colombians. Thirty-one kilos of cocaine were shipped from 
Ecuador. An attempt was made to smuggle in only 14 kilos. Some 
16 kilos was seized by Copenhagen's narcotics police before it 
could be distributed. This was accomplished through a series of 
risky actions undertaken in Ecuador, the Netherlands, and 
Denmark. 
  The smuggler chase came to a head when the police in 
Ecuador's capital city, Quito, telephoned Copenhagen police 
headquarters on Wednesday, 29 December. An airmail package with 
a Danish address on it had been noted at a post office. It 
contained two bowling balls that were filled with 6,600 grams of 
concentrated cocaine. 
  The narcotics police quickly dispatched a vice commissioner 
to Quito. He accompanied the costly shipment on a plane back to 
Denmark on 10 January. The police emptied the bowling balls, 
which had been cast as a shell around the cocaine, and then had 
the post office send the package on to the recipient in the 
Netherlands. 
<H5>  Apprehended at a Burger Restaurant </H5>
  Next act: Two men from Nakskov, ages 19 and 25, took the 
train to Amsterdam on 14 January. They brought with them two 
carrying cases with the now-empty bowling balls. On 18 February 
they were arrested at a burger restaurant in Amsterdam together 
with a 23-year-old Colombian whom the police charged with the 
intention of taking delivery of the cocaine. He is in custody in 
Amsterdam. The Danes were handed over to Danish authorities and 
are in custody in Copenhagen. 
  Still another unsuccessful smuggling took place on New 
Year's 
Eve. This ended with the arrest of three people in Copenhagen as 
they were preparing to take delivery of a large shipment from 
Ecuador via Amsterdam. That package contained five 
innocent-looking EDP monitors (screen with "internal 
components") made by a recognized Korean manufacturer. A customs 
official in Amsterdam became suspicious of the crates during the 
stopover and found 5,600 grams of cocaine glued between the 
components of the screens. 
  The whole lot was sent under "controlled transfer"--as the 
police call it--to the addressee in Copenhagen. 
<H5>  Rich on Welfare </H5>
  On 24 January, at the residence of a 48-year-old welfare 
recipient in Amager--charged with being the primary Danish 
receiver--the police found 117 grams of cocaine, 160,000 kroner, 
exchange vouchers for an additional 170,000 kroner, as well as 
many meters of hollow, braided rope. 
  "This could have been used to smuggle in 8 kilos of cocaine, 
but we do not know what has become of the drugs," said Criminal 
Inspector Bjorn. 
  However, the police know from their analyses that cocaine 
had 
been packed into the ropes. In addition to the "rope trick," the 
welfare recipient was also charged with having taken delivery of 
6.6 kilos worth of drugs in three instances of smuggling. 
  The acknowledged smuggling incidents were spread over the 
period between April 1993 and January 1994. Gustavo Rubiano, a 
Colombian, has been indicated as the head man and organizer. He 
came to Denmark in February 1992 and that September received a 
three-year sentence for the smuggling of 731 grams of cocaine 
and for falsifying documents in a monetary transaction. 
  The testimony in the case reveals that Rubiano directed the 
operation from prison, among other things in meetings with his 
two sons. One son is a 20-year-old now sought for drug-related 
criminal activities and the other is the 23-year-old arrested at 
the burger restaurant in Amsterdam. The police know that Rubiano 
hired two Danish couriers who met the Colombian in prison while 
they were serving sentences for earlier crimes. 
<H5>  Narcotics Police Chief's Warning </H5>
  Yesterday the narcotics police fetched Rubiano in Vridslose, 
interrupted his jail term, and charged him with organizing the 
smuggling and attempted smuggling of 45 kilos of cocaine--in 
addition to the drugs for which he has already been sentenced. 
  Finally, there is a young Danish woman serving a four-year 
sentence in the Netherlands. She was arrested in June 1993 in 
Amsterdam with 4 kilos of cocaine. Today the police know that 
she was also hired by the Rubiano gang as a courier. 
  "Often it is very young people who sign on for a trip to the 
sunny southern shores after delivering a shipment of drugs. I 
would like to give young people a very strong warning against 
accepting this offer. They must expect that sooner or later they 
will be caught," said the narcotics police chief.

<F P=106> [Article by Morten Pihl: "Europe Declines to Legalize </F>
Drugs"--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE introduction] 
  [Text] Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) has 
rejected the proposal made by Pelle Voigt (Socialist Party) that 
the Baltic countries form a joint maritime police force in order 
to put a stop to the activities of the Russian Mafia in the 
Baltic. 
  ``No'' to legalizing drugs. ``Yes'' to more prevention, 
treatment, and rehabilitation. And ``yes'' to focusing on 
pursuit of drug traffickers and producers rather than drug 
addicts. 
  According to Olsen, this was the prevailing consensus last 
week in Strasbourg at a narcotics summit meeting of European 
justice and health ministers, in which Russia and a number of 
former Soviet republics participated. 
  "The principle theme was that drugs should not be legalized. 
Efforts should be directed primarily toward prevention, 
treatment, and rehabilitation. The objective is, first of all, 
to lessen the demand for drugs and, second, to limit the harm 
they do," said Olsen: 
  "People must be weaned away from the use of drugs, until the 
drug dealers are left standing in the streets like men selling 
Christmas trees on New Year's." 
<H5>  Limit on Control </H5>
  The supply of drugs must be cut off by police action, but, 
according to Olsen, there is a limit to what can be done. 
  "This should not be the only way or be relied upon 
exclusively. You cannot get rid of drugs just by going after 
drug addicts. To a great extent it is the dealers and producers 
that you have to get. We cannot have open drug dealing on the 
streets, but on the other hand, we cannot turn everybody's 
pockets inside out to see whether or not they have drugs. We 
have to go after the big quantities," he said. Together with 
Health Minister Torben Lund (Social Democrat), Olsen will 
introduce a drug initiative later in the month. 
  Olsen would also like to beef up international police 
cooperation as a step in combating the international criminal 
syndicates who deal not only in drugs, but also in other 
activities such as theft. He regards the 500 break-ins in 
Jutland over the last four months are an indication of this. 
  Greater cooperation with Russia and the Baltic countries is 
essential in the battle against the Russian Mafia, the justice 
minister feels. 
  Even so, Olsen does not support Voigt's proposal that the 
Baltic states should form a joint maritime police force in order 
to put a stop to the Russian Mafia's illegal transport of drugs, 
weapons, radioactive material, and people over the Baltic. 
  The problem was brought home last Friday morning when 36 
Tamil asylum-seekers entered the country via Koge in life rafts 
set into the frigid water under cover of darkness. The Tamils 
were very likely shipped out from a harbor in one of the Baltic 
states after a stopover in Moscow. 
<H5>  Cooperation "Here and Now" </H5>
  "Closer political cooperation is an absolute necessity, but 
we do not have time to wait for new organizations to be built 
up. The idea of a maritime Baltic police would be good if it 
could be formed quickly, but I doubt that it can. It would 
become entangled in reports, committees, and what have you. And 
that would simply mean that we lose more time. For this reason, 
I am opting for a `here and now' approach, for strengthening the 
cooperation that already exists with countries such as Russia 
and the Baltic states, as well as for those organizations we 
already have in place," said Olsen, citing Interpol and 
Europol's Drug Unit as examples. 
  It is not the large organizations so much as the personal 
contact between the police corps and an increased exchange of 
information between countries that is needed. This must be done 
here and now, because according to Olsen, the international 
criminal syndicates are knocking on Denmark's door: 
  "For a long time, we were spared much of the criminal 
activity perpetrated by the international syndicates, but they 
are moving nearer our borders. The meeting in Strasbourg 
emphasized to me how important it is that we seriously get to 
work on implementing the proposal I will introduce this summer 
on combating organized crime."

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Lehmann: "Forget About </F>
Legalization of Drugs"--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] General practitioners must cease prescribing 
methadone and addiction-treatment programs need to be improved; 
police actions must continue whereas talk of legalizing hashish 
must cease. Treatment program director, Jorgen Green, has few 
doubts on the subject after 30 years of experience with drug 
users. 
  Quicker and tougher measures need to be taken against drug 
abusers. The first time the police nab a drug addict, he must 
get an offer he cannot refuse. Either he submits to controlled 
treatment or else the judge gets his file, and the addict risks 
being locked up. 
  Having worked with drug addicts since the onset in the 
carefree 1960s, the director of the youth center in Vordingborg 
has little doubt. 
  "But we will not use force--we do not want to battle our 
clients. We have abolished illegal use of force and corporal 
punishment. There is no reason to resurrect them," said Green. 
  If the drug abuser breaks off treatment, he must go back to 
the judge on his own and explain his breach of contract. 
  Green recommended that the judge enter into treatment 
contracts with drug abusers in the same manner as is done with 
youth contracts. But most importantly, drug abusers must find 
work or schooling. Even if others have to be moved back in line. 
  "There are lots of other groups we give advantages to. 
Well-educated youth already have excellent opportunities to move 
ahead. The worst thing that you can do is to hand drug addicts a 
maintenance allowance. Then they can sit on the sidewalk and 
sell their various wares to other addicts and beginners. A 
government employee on the state, county, or district payroll 
and an addict on the government payroll cost about the same," 
said Green. 
  He has also taken a close look at the right of general 
practitioners to prescribe methadone to addicts. 
  "Right now we maintain people on permanent methadone use. If 
we dispense methadone, it must be tied to an offer of treatment. 
It does not cost any more than doing nothing--it is just a 
question of where the funds are put. Either they have to be 
spent on rehabilitating drug addicts or else in combatting 
crime, prisons, and hospital care," he said. 
  Methadone treatment, on the other hand, only makes it more 
difficult to cure addicts of their addiction, according to 
Green. Methadone treatment thwarts every other form of 
treatment. The addict sets up obstacles and forces the doctor to 
write out a description instead of quitting the needle and 
embarking upon a difficult cure--without drugs. 
  "You are letting the drug abuser leap from the fat into the 
fire, because if he does not have a grip on his life, he will 
supplement his methadone with alcohol, pills, and heroin," 
Green's experience has shown him. 
  He rejects the idea that it is police raids on drug users 
and 
pushers that have caused some users to make their next injection 
their last. He is strongly opposed in this view by the Danish 
Association of General Practitioners, which has vehemently 
protested the police raids on pushers. 
  "If one looks at police figures for 1992, it is evident that 
there was a significant drop in the number of drug-related 
deaths in Copenhagen during the Vesterbro raids, while there was 
a rise in the provinces," he said. 
  The deaths are due to a number of diverse factors: 
  --The average age among drug addicts has risen. Recruitment 
of youths is declining. 
  --The channels of distribution have changed. This means that 
neither addict nor pusher knows how much morphine is contained 
in a dose, with the consequent risk of overdose. 
  --There is an increase in the flow of methadone coming out 
of 
general practitioners' offices. Addicts supplement methadone 
with drugs on the illegal market. 
  --Drug abusers are psychologically and physically worn down. 
  --AIDS claims the life of many more drug addicts than was 
the 
case earlier. 
  --Revision of police statistical methods. 
  The one thing Green does not believe is responsible for the 
rise in the number of drug deaths is police intervention. 
  "It happens because certain idiots take trips to Bangkok, 
buy 
heroin, and rush back to Copenhagen to sell it," he said. 
  Meanwhile, he points to studies in Zurich where the number 
of 
drug-related deaths rose significantly when police withdrew and 
permitted a "needle park" to be created where addicts could hang 
out unmolested. 
  "Unless we create a kind of ghetto, virtually any idiot can 
burst on the scene with drugs and slip out of the country with 
money in his pocket. This guy could care less about how much 
morphine there is in the drug," Green warned. 
  Daily incidences of lethal injections forced the authorities 
to close the park in 1992. 
  Green paints a scary picture of Copenhagen as the Amsterdam 
of the North. He warns against setting up "coffee shops" where 
hashish may be freely bought and sold. 
  "When I hear people mentioning it, I often wonder whether 
they have really seen what goes on in Amsterdam. If they did, 
people would return home shocked and say this is not what we 
want," said Green. 
  He does not believe there is anything to indicate that 
legalizing one drug or another and selling it in "coffee shops" 
would reduce the amount of addiction. In Amsterdam, pushers 
selling the hardest drugs stand right outside the cafe doors. 
Shops selling syringes, hash pipes, and equipment for snorting 
are located right next door. 
  Nor does he feel that a rise in illegal activity involving 
euphoric drugs can be used as an argument for setting up locales 
where hash is freely sold. 
  "This merely reflects the level of activity of the police in 
the area. The police activity in Christiania alone causes that 
number to rise," said Green. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Lehmann: "Police Made Whipping Boy in </F>
Narcotics Debate"--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] The director of a drug treatment center fears that 
drug addicts will be victims of neighborhood action if the 
police withdraw from Vesterbro. Heightened police effort forces 
drug addicts into treatment, he says. 
  Drug addicts would continue to use drugs even if police 
ceased going after pushers. The police offensive against drugs 
on the street forces many addicts into treatment. 
  That is what Jorgen Green, director of the County Youth 
Center in Storstrom County told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. Ever since 
the 1960s, when hard drugs made their impact, Green has been 
working with drug abusers and their addiction. 
  "The police have been wrongfully made the whipping boy. 
People say that police raids on drug dealers on the streets are 
responsible for the death of drug addicts. I do not feel that 
there is any proof of this. It has not been our experience that 
this is what is happening," he said, 
  "The drug treatment facilities will simply have more to do 
if 
the police do not constantly make inroads on the drug trade," he 
said. Green feels the rise in drug use is due to the fact that 
drug addicts do not receive the treatment they need; that their 
average age has risen; that AIDS is the cause of a number of 
deaths; and that drug addicts are psychologically and physically 
run down. 
  "Drug addicts die because they do not get into treatment or 
are refused treatment. The moment the police are on the street 
we find more drug addicts asking to get into treatment," said 
Green. He strongly opposes stopping the police actions against 
drug dealing and pushers in places such as Vesterbro. 
  "I know very well what the inhabitants of Vesterbro will do 
if the police withdraw. They will get hold of some baseball bats 
and they will drum both drug dealers and addicts out of the 
Vesterbro quarter. If the police leave, they will become the 
victims of local justice," he said. 
  These remarks come two weeks before Health Minister Torben 
Lund (Social Democrat) is expected to make a drug policy 
statement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Pledges Battle Against </F>
Mafia"] 
  [Text] Palermo, 20 Mar (ANSA) -- TV 
tycoon-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi pledged here today 
that votes for his Go Italy [Forza Italia] party in the imminent 
general elections will be votes against the Mafia, apparently 
making up for what was perceived as an unwillingness to make an 
outright disclaimer of Mafia support in a radio debate aired 
earlier. 
  Debating with Left Democrat leader Achille Occhetto, his 
main 
electoral rival, Berlusconi was asked about a declaration from 
an imprisoned Mafia boss late in February who said Sicilian 
organised crime would be voting for Berlusconi. The Milan-based 
tycoon, who threw his hat into the political ring in January, 
first said he thought it was impossible to speculate if the 
Mafia would vote in any one way. 
  When asked for an outright disclaimer, he then said he 
failed 
to see how a party entering an election for the first time could 
be accused of links with the Mafia; then remarked that "anyone 
can say they are going to vote for anyone else," leading 
Occhetto, a major figure in the Progressive Alliance fighting 
Berlusconi and the right-wingers, to comment: "I take note that, 
three times over, no response was forthcoming." 
  The radio debate, a transcript of which was released 
yesterday evening, went on the air amidst allegations to Go 
Italy's left, from the moderate conservatives to radical 
leftists, that ancien regime figures and ties are being recycled 
in the new party's ranks, especially thanks to Berlusconi's 
long-standing relationship with ex-Premier Bettino Craxi and his 
discredited Socialist Party. At the same time, rumours began 
circulating yesterday evening that Marcello Dell`Utri, 
managing-director of Berlusconi's advertising arm Publitalia, 
and already under investigation in Milan with others for false 
company accounting, had been linked by a Mafia state's witness 
to organised crime bosses. 
  Judicial sources would say only that Mafia boss Salvatore 
Cancemi had been questioned recently by prosecutors from various 
Italian cities, but refused to specify about what. The chief 
prosecutor in Caltanisetta, Sicily, Giovanni Tinebra, added 
today that the alleged links made with Cancemi's testimony were 
"absolutely gratuitous." 
  Tinebra also joined the school of judicial thinking that 
takes Cancemi's disclosures with a strong pinch of salt. The 
turncoat, whose codename is Omega, has yet to be admitted to the 
official witness protection programme. 
  Usually reliable judicial and investigative sources in Rome 
said, however, that questioning of other Mafia witnesses seemed 
to corroborate Cancemi's claims. 
  Other reports from judicial circles in Palermo said that one 
line of investigation against Dell`Utri claims he was 
responsible for recycling Mafia drug trafficking funds. 
  Allegations of links between Berlusconi, Dell`Utri and the 
Mafia date back to the 1980s. Testimony from Berlusconi in June 
1987 confirmed that, in 1975, Dell`Utri got Berlusconi to give a 
suspected Mafia drug trafficker, Vittorio Mangano, a job as 
bailiff at his villa at Arcore near Milan. 
  Other testimony from a financier, Filippo Rapisarda, 
reported 
conversations in late 1978 in which one Mafia boss, Domenico 
Teresi, visiting the office of Rapisarda's then partner 
Dell`Utri, told him Berlusconi had suggested he should enter a 
partnership with him in a private TV station, in an operation 
"worth 10 billion lire." 1978 was about the time when 
Berlusconi started building his TV and media empire. 
  Fighting these and other allegations such that Sicilian 
branches of his department store chain, Standa, are run jointly 
with Mafia figures, Berlusconi, arriving for a Go Italy rally at 
Palermo's Mediterranean Fair, pledged that the votes his party 
receives "in Sicily, Campania, Calabria and throughout Italy" 
would all be votes against the Mafia. He also voiced his "deep 
appreciation" for churchmen whom he described as "heroes" in the 
front line against organised crime, a reference to yesterday's 
slaying of a priest near Naples. 
  Over 7,000 supporters were reported as attending the rally 
for which Berlusconi's TV networks created a live nationwide 
tie-up. Figures released by the Berlusconi polling institute, 
Diakron, for March 1, before the publication ban on poll 
results, claimed about 30 percent of the vote for Go Italy and 
40 percent in Sicily. Other polls have cited Go Italy at 20.25 
percent nationwide. 
  In other points, Berlusconi answered northern demands for 
federalism by saying that Italy will enjoy growth only if "North 
and South march together."

<F P=106> [Article by Rajeev Syal: "Killer Heroin Reaches London After </F>
Eight Die in Glasgow"] 
  [Text] A cache of heroin so powerful that police warn it 
could kill after a single "fix" has been found in London after 
similar batches have claimed the lives of addicts in other parts 
of Britain. 
  The new batch surfaced in Camden, north London, and is twice 
as strong as most heroin bought on the streets. Its discovery 
comes amid growing concern about a rise in the quantity and 
purity of heroin being sold around the country. 
  Last week, eight people died in Glasgow after using 
unusually 
pure forms of the drug. Nine have been killed in Bristol during 
the past six months in similar circumstances, and seven died 
last year in King's Cross, close to where the latest batch of 
heroin was found. 
  The discovery was reported by Release, the drug advice 
agency, which has been told by local counsellors that it is 64 
percent pure--street heroin is usually 35-40 percent pure. "The 
users have not got the tolerance for such high strength, and we 
see the tragic consequences," said Simon Kirkham, group 
spokesman. 
  Powerful drugs interfere with the part of the brain that 
controls breathing. Death arises from congestion in the lungs. 
  Police are trying to trace the source of the London batch, 
and said they were taking the threat it poses very seriously. It 
was found only three days after the latest death in Glasgow. 
  Police in Glasgow have offered an amnesty to people active 
in 
the drug world in an attempt to find the rest of the lethal 
batch, which they believe to be as much as 74 percent pure. 
  But drug counsellors and relatives of those who died in 
Glasgow dispute the official view that high-grade heroin is to 
blame. They insist that drug cocktails and overdoses may have 
killed many of the addicts. Two years ago Glasgow was the scene 
of 20 unexplained deaths which were blamed on high-quality 
heroin. 
  The National Criminal Intelligence Unit believes danger 
arises when inept or inexperienced drug dealers fail to mix 
heroin properly. "Some young dealers may not be used to handling 
the drug, which can be highly dangerous," a spokesman said. 
  In Bristol, laboratory tests last week showed that heroin 
believed to have caused at least four of the nine abuser deaths 
was 63 percent pure. Police fear the purity of the drug reflects 
the large amount of heroin in the British market. 
  Inspector Peter Wills, of Avon police, said drug dealers 
normally mixed the drug with similar looking substances such as 
baking powder, talcum or dried baby milk to maximise profits. 
"Whereas a street dealer would mix the drug with other 
substances if there is a drought--thus increasing his own 
profit--when there is a lot of heroin on the streets, they do 
not need to," he said. 
  Heroin seizures have increased dramatically throughout the 
country in the past year, particularly in Avon, Manchester, 
London and inner-city areas. In Gloucestershire there was a 400 
percent increase, while seizures went up by 600 percent in 
Northumbria and 1,000 percent in Nottinghamshire.

<F P=106> [Article by Jenny Shields: "Cocaine Smuggler Jailed for 30 </F>
Years"] 
  [Text] A Spanish skipper who smuggled a "murderous 
cargo" of high purity cocaine into Scotland was jailed for 30 
years at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday. 
  The sentence passed on Francisco Torres is believed to be 
the 
heaviest handed down by a Scottish court for a drugs offence and 
was intended, the judge said, to "act as signal to others". 
  Prison sentences totalling more than 100 years have now been 
given to smugglers and couriers involved in the drug-running 
operation which ended in Britain's largest-ever drugs seizure. 
  Five Scots are in jail for their involvement, but a sixth, 
referred to as Mr X, is still being hunted. 
  Torres, 28, ferried the cocaine across the Atlantic in 
January 1991. It was brought ashore by dinghy at a remote cove 
in Sutherland. 
  The cocaine, which had an estimated street value of 
&pound;100 
million, was intercepted near Newtonmore in the Highlands. It 
was being driven south on the A9 disguised as waste from 
Dounreay power station. 
  Torres, who was convicted of drug smuggling at the High 
Court 
in Glasgow last month after being extradited from Canada last 
July, attempted to commit suicide in prison while awaiting 
sentence. 
  Yesterday Lord Weir told Torres: "You piloted this murderous 
cargo to our shores. It brings misery and death to its users. 
The sentence I have to pass is intended as a signal to others 
that it is folly to risk landing controlled drugs in Scotland." 
  Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said that Torres still 
vehemently protested his innocence, and wanted to challenge 
media reports--based on information from Customs officials in 
Britain and Canada--that he was a major drug runner. 
  Mr Findlay said there was "not a single scrap of evidence" 
to 
justify the allegations, and argued that Christopher Howarth, of 
Ullapool in the West Highlands, who was jailed for 25 years for 
his part in the operation, was a major player but his client was 
simply a courier. 
  He urged Lord Weir to draw a distinction between the 
sentence 
imposed on Howarth and that which should be passed on Torres. 
However Lord Weir said he had to consider the jail terms already 
imposed, and particularly that on Howarth.

<F P=106> [Article by Margarita Kornysheva under the rubric "Crime and </F>
the Law": "Until the Chicken Has Its Head Cut Off"] 
  [Text] Here is some information about the drug trade 
obtained from confidential sources. First, not only do 
well-established systems for the delivery and distribution of 
narcotic substances operate in Estonia, but we also have our own 
trained experts who are capable of determining the quality of 
the "merchandise" and pricing it in a highly professional 
manner. Second, there is a "fixation" on the border, where only 
"dupes," random people, get caught. Third, there is a quite well 
developed secrecy system. Fourth, cruel laws apply to the hilt 
within the drug groups--if someone quits the game, or "spills 
the beans," he therefore chooses "eternal rest" somewhere in a 
quarry in Manniku. Fifth, threats against narcotics policemen 
are increasing, and actions against them are quite real. All of 
this is happening against the background of the fact that, in 
the words of the psychiatrist Anti Liiv, "even the revolt in the 
northeastern area of the country is less of a catastrophe for 
the Estonian people than drug addiction." 
<H3>  `A Strange Small State in Which the Drug Problem Is of No 
Concern to Anyone' </H3>
  Doctor Liiv, who at one time practiced in the United States, 
maintains that this is precisely how Americans perceive Estonia. 
  As you will understand, this problem "did not exist" in our 
country until sometime in 1985, just like prostitution, 
corruption, and all manner of other "capitalist ills" "did not 
exist." Finally, they came to their senses and saw that one in 
four apprehended thieves had something to do with drugs (by now, 
one in three criminals commits the crime either intoxicated with 
drugs or in possession of these substances). In short, the 
phenomenon manifested itself sharply. Moreover, compared, for 
example, to the year 1988, which is usually the reference point, 
the phenomenon has grown to a quite respectable size. Data 
quoted by the newspaper ARIPAEV not so long ago show that 
according to the most conservative calculations, each of the 
8,000 uncovered drug addicts spends 200 kroons weekly for the 
poison. The annual volume of the local drug trade comes to at 
least 60 million kroons. How are they to be legalized? We do not 
have a law that hampers money laundering although, in an effort 
to get the endeavor off the ground, representatives of the 
competent organs have visited the West to "collect material" in 
order to offer our legislators the draft of this particular law. 
The republic still does not have a state program for combating 
drug addiction, nor is there a major specialized police unit in 
the scope of whose interests drugs would fall. Who benefits by 
so nicely sweeping under the rug a problem that clearly 
threatens the very life of our society? 
  In the opinion of Anti Liiv, and it is hard to disagree with 
him, the current government benefits. What other explanation is 
there for the fact that Estonia, a UN member, has failed to join 
a single international convention forbidding trafficking in 
narcotic substances? One cannot help wondering, all the more so 
because the last document of this kind that was accepted by the 
international community in 1988, hinders money 
laundering, requiring that commercial secrets which are of 
certain interest be revealed. In view of the absence of a 
coordinating center for drug control, our country has been 
unable to submit information about the domestic drug trade to 
the UN for three years now. 
<H5>  Narcotic Poison in Estonia Is 10 Times Cheaper Than in Europe </H5>
  This is the case on the "black" market. According to 
information obtained from the security police, a five-gram 
package of marijuana and one cubic [centimeter] of liquid opium 
cost 50 kroons, one gram of hashish--no less than 75 kroons, and 
a cubic [centimeter] of a synthetic drug (too weak for 
"professionals")--as little as 25 kroons. Cocaine belongs to a 
class of the most expensive and, apparently, least popular 
"substances" for this reason. It is not cheap in Europe, 
either--a five-gram package fetches $205. 
  At present, drugs of both vegetable origin (marijuana, 
hashish, opium milk) and medicinal origin (diazepam) are common 
in the republic. The former are more common, after all. 
Depending on the specifics of transportation, their form differs 
widely. A drug-sniffing dog "smells" drugs of vegetable origin. 
However, the contrivances of drug dealers may rob it of the 
scent. Previously, drugs were often transported in car bumpers. 
The "merchandise" was placed there, and fresh epoxy resin was 
poured over it. There is no way that a dog would "sniff out" a 
drug in this hiding place for the next three or four days. 
  Opium poppies--quite recently, this combination of words was 
associated solely with Central Asia, and to a lesser degree with 
Ukraine. However, a few years ago it was learned how to grow 
this crop in Estonia and Lithuania out of high-grade seeds 
brought in from Kazakhstan. There are hills with plantations 
between them. They can only be seen from a helicopter, and are 
not visible from the road. The owner harvests, say, one-tenth of 
a hectare, sells the crop, and buys a new house, a horse.... In 
1989 an entire syndicate delivering drugs from Lithuania to us 
was uncovered. Fourteen people ended up in the dock. 
<H5>  The Realm of Transit </H5>
  Poison comes to Estonia from Russia, Lithuania, Central 
Asia, 
and the Caucasus. Luckily we cannot afford Western products. New 
times have resulted in new opportunities for drug sales. The 
transit of drugs through the Baltic area, in particular through 
"us," previously without precedent, at any rate on this scale, 
has become established. 
  Given the actually nonexistent border and the "most 
incorruptible" customs in the world, the organization of 
deliveries is not too exacting an endeavor. Outside groups have 
appeared which have ultimately established themselves solidly 
here. The deep pockets of their members have been helpful in 
securing residence permits or citizenship for them. And how many 
nerves do the common residents of Estonia shatter battling for 
the same?! 
  According to data from the security police, everyone and his 
brother plies the drug trade: The drug business in Estonia is 
controlled by Azeri, Perm, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Riga, and 
Krasnodar groups. For example, the Azeris control the delivery 
of marijuana and hashish, and people from Krasnodar--that of 
both marijuana and opium poppy. A case in which the traffic 
police stopped a new Opel, in whose trunk 10 kilograms of 
marijuana were found, at 1915 on 4 January on the Tartu Highway 
close to the locality of Moega, is characteristic. It was 
learned later that the drug was being transported from the Viru 
section of the border and was controlled by an Azeri "company." 
Most likely they were driving to an out-of-the-way location in 
Harju Rayon. Practitioners are aware of these cases. The 
interested person locates a hamlet with a granny as old as the 
hills: "Here are 100 `greenbacks' for you, go buy yourself a 
goat. In return, put my suitcase away somewhere, and let it sit 
there until needed." The old woman does not care: "Son, toss it 
in the hayloft. I am not pressed for space." 
  All "outsiders" have connections to local "brigades," more 
often than not Russian-speaking, which deliver, for example, 
opium poppies from the areas of the Chu Valley and Issyk-Kul in 
Kyrgyzstan. The pattern is as follows: the south--Estonia--our 
countrymen pick it up, pay for it, and transport it to 
Scandinavia through their own channels. Over there, dealers get 
the "merchandise" and dispose of it "on the spot" (the lion's 
share of narcotic substances remains in the region) or ship it 
on to Europe. 
  According to information from the Department of Police of 
the 
Republic of Estonia, last year more than 100 kilograms of 
various drugs were confiscated in the territory of the republic. 
Specialists believe that this was quite a lot, but they state 
sadly right away: Certainly, more than that went abroad. 
<H5>  The Black Triangle </H5>
  This consists of the suppliers, distributors, and consumers 
of poison. As a rule, those who put drugs in circulation do not 
"get high" themselves. They are more cunning and slippery than 
the usual common criminals. 
  An alarming situation has developed in Tallinn. Police 
functionaries are aware of about 30 apartments in which the 
manufacturing of drug preparations is organized on a large 
scale. According to data of the law enforcement organs, 
gatherings of those fond of smoking or shooting up form 
virtually on every street! Drug addicts are becoming a class. 
Incidentally, there are people among them who are quite high on 
the social ladder. Terrifying reports have been received from 
some schools in the capital city--some students of senior grades 
(but not only them!) become links in the chain of the 
distributors of narcotic substances, almost inevitably getting 
their first taste of the latter. 
  People in the know maintain that so-called "pure" drug 
addicts do not exist in nature. This means that people who have 
become addicted to drugs are prepared to do anything ahead of 
time, driven by the fear of "withdrawal throes" alone. Let us 
say that such a person picks up three or four kilograms of 
"merchandise," keeps one-third, and sells two-thirds. Chasing 
clientele, he would be happy to get anyone and everyone 
"hooked." Be that as it may, this is an income, although there 
is a risk of incurring criminal liability. Of course, they 
steal, too, but the funds procured in this manner are not major. 
  Specialists predict it will not be long before high-capacity 
underground plants for manufacturing drug preparations go on 
line in Estonia. One does not have to be a specialist to duly 
appreciate the exceptionally favorable conditions that bring 
this "bright future" closer. There is nothing standing in the 
way of the time of prosperity coming to the soil of Estonia for 
a business which unfortunately has ranked second after the arms 
trade throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Uldis Rudaks: "Ministry of Interior Affairs </F>
Establishes a Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Interior Affairs of the Latvian 
Republic has recently established a Bureau for Combating Drug 
Addiction. The newly created bureau is a police organization 
with all the respective rights--to conduct operative work, to 
collect information, to arrest, and to implement searches, 
Bureau Chief Vilnis Kipens told DIENA today. 
  The state police of all countries have a special department 
for dealing with drug addiction, he said. Foreign experts have 
acknowledged that in Latvia, which due to its geographical 
position is situated in the middle of all drug trafficking 
routes, narcobusiness is developing more quickly than in other 
countries. Moreover, since the chemical and pharmaceutical 
industries in Latvia are highly developed, a center for the 
Baltic states to combat drug addiction should be situated right 
here in Riga. 
  "The problem of drug addiction in Latvia is not yet as 
alarming as in other foreign countries; however, the bureau was 
established just to keep abreast, and not to find ourselves in a 
situation of `running after the train.' Usually we begin to 
organize things only when the water is already flowing into our 
mouths," said Kipens. 
  The bureau was officially opened on 22 February. Thus far it 
has 31 policemen on its staff. The bureau has two 
departments--one is the Riga department, consisting fully of the 
former seventh section of the Riga Criminal Police (for 
combating drug addiction), which will fight drug addiction in 
Riga. The general department will supervise chemical and 
pharmaceutical plants, the airport, and the seaport. We are 
also planning regional groups, cooperation with customs officers 
and national guards, with neighboring countries--Lithuania, 
which consistently supplies Latvia with poppies, Kaliningrad, as 
well as Ukraine and Russia, through which the drugs from the 
Caucasus and the Middle East are being delivered, stated V. 
Kipens. 
  The latest report from the Interior Affairs Ministry says 
that on 10 March the bureau officers arrested three persons in a 
drug den on Zentene street 14 and confiscated drugs. At a 
similar spot on Maskavas street 285/2 on the same day five 
persons were arrested. 
  V. Kipens emphasized that during a drug-induced craze, drug 
addicts are capable of committing any crime. On the night of 12 
March, a group of drug addicts was arrested in the center of 
Riga. Besides drugs, the policemen discovered in their car a set 
of tools for breaking into cars, and a hand grenade. During the 
same night, one man was arrested in Riga in a state of narcotic 
intoxication, with two full syringes. 
  The Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction appeals to the 
population of Latvia to inform the bureau about anyone having 
information on drug dens by calling the following numbers: 
208478 or 208473.

<F P=106> [Article by Rita Nasheniyetse: "With Narcotics to Europe; </F>
The Baltic Today Is an Ideal Place for Transit of Narcotics"] 
  [Text] In September of 1993, the police in Olaine 
confiscated 8 kilograms of amphetamine pills. This was the 
paltry remnants of the Olaine "goods" which several years ago 
filled Europe. Around half of the amphetamines which ended up in 
the hands of the English police came from Latvia. There are 
hardly any other Latvian goods which are so abundantly 
represented abroad. However, the production of amphetamines is 
not our largest contribution to the international drug trade. 
<H5>  Latvia Is Integrating </H5>
  From the territory of the Near and Middle East, where opium 
and narcotics of the cannabis group are produced, from the 
countries of the Golden Crescent--Iran, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan--the goods, according to tradition, were sent to 
Europe along a relatively short transit route through Turkey, 
the Balkans, Greece and other Mediterranean countries. At the 
present time, the transport of narcotics has been shifted closer 
to the northern boundaries. Crossing the CIS countries, 
shipments of drugs make a huge circle and are re-routed in the 
direction of the Baltic. 
  The "goods" from Russia, the Transcaucasus and the southern 
republics of the former USSR also come through the Baltic 
(primarily through Latvia with its three ports). Narcotics 
intended for the Scandinavian countries are brought in from 
Poland. 
  Also not excluded is the particularly exotic transit (from 
some African country) or through Russia and the Far East from 
South America. The Baltic today is the ideal place for the 
transit of narcotics. A wonderful geographic position in 
combination with weakly guarded borders, an increasing influence 
of organized crime, legislation which has not yet been regulated 
and clearly expressed corruption have become the reasons why 
narcotics have begun to be distributed along the channels in the 
direction of the Baltic with an ever increasing intensity. 
<H5>  Latvia as a Market for Narcotics </H5>
  "Latvia as a market for narcotics does not yet have 
particular significance, but it does play a very important role 
in the transit of narcotics," says the deputy chief of the Main 
Police Administration of the city of Riga, Vilnis Kipens. Mr. 
Kostenko from the 6th section of the police department also 
agrees with him. However, this certainly does not mean that the 
drug business here is not a profitable endeavor. Such a point of 
view was expressed in the newspaper TEV in the issue for 15 
November 1993: "As strange as it may seem, the profits of the 
mafia obtained from trade in narcotics in Latvia are not great. 
As compared with the developed countries, the consumption of 
these substances here is rather insignificant. Therefore, trade 
in them is entrusted to dealers of a lower level--obviously, 
under the condition that they regularly hand over the 
appropriate part of their income to their bosses." 
  Trade in narcotics at street "points," perhaps, does not 
make 
an impression. However, this is merely the "enterprise" of small 
dealers who, in turn, rely on "wholesalers"--large dealers who 
rarely catch the attention of the police and are almost never 
detained by them. 
  Approximately 1,000 laty worth of goods pass through the 
hands of the large dealers in a 24-hour period. A large dealer 
always has at least 20 kilograms of poppy straw on hand, several 
liters of "khitkhanki" (raw opium--raw material for production 
of heroin, which is also used in the form of a semi-finished 
product) or goods which are analogous in their "value." Large 
dealers do not stand at the very top of the pyramid in the 
narcotics trade. They may conditionally be called the second 
degree workers in this business. 
  As to where the monetary relations with organized crime lead 
subsequently, we can only conjecture. We should remember that in 
Latvia the source of profit has become specifically 
transit, and the "informals" will certainly not let 
anything of theirs slip away. Although we must also remember 
that part of the goods pass them by. Although the drug business 
is that sphere of activity in which the representatives of 
organized crime find a common language, for some the possibility 
of getting a higher profit seems too tempting. 
<H5>  Couriers in the Drug Business </H5>
  The most significant moment in the work of the narcotics 
transporter--the courier--is to bring the goods over the border. 
The "spectrum" of courier cadres at the present time is rather 
broad--from "specialists" to drug addicts engaging in transport 
at their own fear and risk. During the operation of "closing" 
the channel for transporting drugs which connected Lithuania and 
Latvia, a family was detained which was transporting across the 
border drugs hidden in the diapers of an infant. 
  However, a trained courier does not travel holding a bag of 
hashish in his hands. The transport of narcotics may be 
organized with the aid of train conductors, locomotive 
engineers, long-distance truck drivers or aircraft pilots. In 
these cases, the courier merely provides the transport for 
shipment of the goods from one place to another, settles 
accounts with the sellers and arranges all necessary matters. 
  A more complex form is also practiced, when one other 
person--a manager--participates in the transport of the drugs. 
If the shipment is especially large or if new business contacts 
are being established, the negotiations at one end or the other, 
as well as the monetary arrangements, are handled by the 
manager. In this case, the courier is responsible for the 
technical aspect--to organize the transport. With the 
"specialization" of the drug business in Eastern Europe and the 
CIS countries, couriers are also becoming professionals. At the 
present time, the number of those couriers which themselves use 
drugs is declining. Among them you will rarely find those who 
use weak drugs for a prolonged period of time, or those whose 
bosses force them to refuse narcotics. A good courier is more 
valuable than gold. He is considered a small but necessary 
detail in the mechanism of the large-scale drug business. 
<H5>  Once Again About the Border </H5>
  Opinions vary as to what percentage of the drugs which are 
brought in are detained at the border. In any case, this is a 
trifle. Foreign experts in combatting the drug trade believe 
that at the moment of import-export, only about 5-6 percent of 
the amount of drugs brought in are actually confiscated in the 
West European countries. Nevertheless, it is specifically the 
border which is the place where the struggle of any state with 
the drug trade begins. A regulated border has not only the 
inspection and detainment of cargo and documents, but also a 
well-ordered system of information. Today there is no precise 
information about who is crossing the border and for what 
purpose. 
  A Bureau on Combatting Narcotics will soon be created in 
Latvia. At the present time, it is presumed that it will employ 
at least 30 persons. But perhaps this is not the indicator which 
we should consider as being decisive, determining the 
effectiveness of the work. Perhaps a more significant indicator 
is the measure to which its work will be supported by the state 
in a financial and juridical sense (with the aid of 
legislation). Ultimately, this is a question of prestige--how 
long will Latvia serve as the window to Europe? A broken window, 
through which anyone who wants to can climb. 
<H5>  Not Only Oaks Grow in the Baltic </H5>
  Opium poppies grow there too. The road to bright capitalism 
has had a heavy impact on the financial situation of the 
peasants. Neither the raising of livestock, nor grain growing 
bring them a decent income. Therefore, they are trying to make a 
living by growing poppies. What areas specifically are taken up 
by them, it is hard to say. However, in Lithuania, where this 
trade has become rather popular, law enforcement workers in 1993 
confiscated around 1 tonne of poppy straw of local production. 
It has been learned from certain unofficial sources that part of 
the opium poppy straw was brought in from Ukraine or from 
Lithuania. Latvia also strives to make its "contribution" to the 
field of poppy raising. The residents of Talsinskiy Rayon worked 
particularly well last year in this regard. 
  Aleksandr Kostenko, chief of the group for combatting drugs 
of the Riga police department's section for combatting organized 
crime, believes that Latvia should seriously undertake the 
struggle against growing narcotics raw material, returning to 
the control measures which were popular in the early 80's. 
  We might add that the opium poppies grown in the northern 
regions are especially highly valued by drug dealers due to 
their prolonged storage time. 
<H5>  The Community Does Not Realize the Full Measure of Danger </H5>
  -- So says Modris Krishyanis, deputy chief of the 7th 
Section 
of the Main Police Administration in the city of Riga. "We in 
Latvia have not yet realized the danger which threatens us. 
Today it seems to us that nothing terrible is happening, but 
this is the calm before the storm. Abroad, even acetone is 
strictly accounted for as a raw material for production of 
narcotics: Its transport, storage and application are under the 
strictest control. Yet here in our country one can buy narcotics 
at the drug store. `Solutan,' which has become a very popular 
medicine in Latvia, and which is prescribed even for children, 
contains ephedrine, which is classed as a stimulant. A drug 
addict needs 6-7 cubic centimeters of this substance, yet from 
two bottles of `solutan' one can get 22 cubic centimeters. All 
this is perfectly well known both to doctors and pharmacists, 
but if a person gets 30 laty a month, he can yield to temptation 
and write a prescription for money or issue the medication for a 
counterfeit prescription." 
  "Very many drug addicts want to get treatment. However, the 
medical institutions in Latvia have allotted only 70 beds for 
this purpose." 
  "At the present time, a drug market is being born in Latvia. 
`Ladies' narcotics--ephedrine and other `mild' pills, which have 
become popular among the young people, in fact create a base for 
the use of strong narcotics in the future." 
<H5>  Narcotics--a Tool for Manipulation </H5>
  Apartment robberies, store hold-ups, assaults in the 
street--these are all methods for desperate drug addicts to get 
money. A glass of pulverized poppy straw costs 4 laty. Young 
girls who offer their bodies for sale in the street, as well as 
certain "call girls," are puppets in the hands of their pimps. 
They have been "hooked." They are totally dependant on the next 
dose of ephedrine (a narcotic which increases the sex drive) or 
heroin. This is almost the only way in which the owner settles 
accounts with such girls. 
  Businessmen, as a rule, try to stay away from narcotics. 
  Nevertheless, a substance for entertaining "higher 
society"--cocaine powder--has appeared in Latvia. This is an 
expensive thing. Cocaine is brought in by transit route from 
Russia (through the Far East, from South America) or from 
Western Europe.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Latvian Supreme Court 
concluded proceedings Tuesday [22 March] in an unlicensed drug 
production case and sentenced the main culprits to three to 
seven years in prison, with property confiscation. 
  The former director general of the state-owned Latbiofarm 
pharmaceutical factory, Ilmars Penke, was convicted for grave 
abuse of service status and large scale keeping and trafficking 
narcotic drugs in acquisitive purposes. 
  Penke was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with 
property 
confiscation, except his summer house. 
  The charges on Penke's deputy, Vyacheslav Kulikov, were the 
same, his sentence is seven and a half years imprisonment with 
property confiscation. 
  The third accomplice, the former central laboratory chief 
Janis Osis was convicted for three and a half years with 
property confiscation. 
  The court maintained that Penke and Kulikov were driven by 
covetousness but Osis--by other personal motives. 
  The Criminal Police Department was commissioned to destroy 
the material evidence of 1 million pills of amphetamine group 
stimulants of the central nervous system, which were produced 
illegally under the disguise of flu medicine. 
  The defendants' defense lawyers said they would appeal. 
  In total, Latbiofarm made 16 million pills of MDA 
amphetamine 
drug between July 14, 1992, and Dec. 1, 1992, against a contract 
with a Slovakian firm. 
  Fifteen million, or 4.5 tons of the drug, were sent to 
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under the shield name of 
remantadine. The German police detected more than 3 tons of MDA 
tablets in the city airport in December, 1992. One third of the 
pills was never found, police reports. 
  The investigation proved that Penke and Kulikov received 
from 
the Slovakian Weinwurm &amp; Co. firm 198,000 Dutch guilders and 
196,500 German marks. Penke and Kulikov divided the money and 
kept it at home. At court, they testified that they would have 
used the resources to pay bonuses to workers. 
  The convicted manufacturers deny their guilt saying they did 
not know they produced a narcotic drug. 
  The court said the defendants had substantially undermined 
the international prestige of Latvia as an independent country.

  [Text] According to the State Drug Treatment and Health 
Center medical institutions have registered 794 drug addicts and 
358 drug users. In 1993, 125 drug addicts were registered and 50 
drug users. Last year 383 drug addicts were treated in various 
medical institutions. 
  For its part in Riga alone there were 2,536 drug addicts, 
people arrested in drug dens and drug dealers, according to the 
information bureau of the National Battle Against Drug Addiction. 
  Unfortunately this is only the visible part of the iceberg. 
Specialists believe that there are six to ten thousand drug 
addicts in Latvia, 80 percent of them under 30 years of age. 
  On 27 February, at 1b Strelnieku Street, in the 
Ziemelblazmas club, at 2:00 pm, people will gather to 
continue working at establishing the movement Parents 
Against Drug Addiction. As NEATKARIGA CINA has already 
written, this movement unites parents in the battle against drug 
addiction in Scandanavia. 
  We remind you of the confidential number for drug addicts: 
391 307.

  [Text] Last night, on a section of the Iskashimskiy "Pamir" 
frontier detachment, Russian border guards thwarted an attempt 
by smugglers to take narcotics from Afghanistan to Tajikistan. 
The Tajik KHOVAR agency learned from military sources that 
there was an armed clash between the border guards and the 
infiltrators. There were no casualties among the servicemen. 
Two smugglers were detained. Of late, this is not the first 
instance of contraband deals between Afghans and locals. 
Recently, Russian border guards detained about 20 smugglers who 
tried to take a consignment from Afghan to Tajik territory.

  [Text] A government source disclosed on 5 February that, 
in connection with the issue of Russian dumping of radioactive 
wastes in the Sea of Japan, the government has firmed its plan 
to provide financial support to Russia for a project to build 
new simplified on-land disposal facilities. The government 
plans to send a fact- finding mission to Russia shortly to work 
out details. 
  Hoping to prevent further dumping of nuclear wastes at sea, 
the government had originally proposed to Russia that it would 
supply a Panamanian-registered chemical tanker (with 
displacement of 6,800 tons). 
  However, Russia rejected the offer in mid-January, pointing 
out that "the tanker cannot operate in frozen waters because the 
outer walls of its hull are too thin." Instead, Russia has 
indicated its intention to tentatively store radioactive wastes 
in its own tanker built exclusively for this purpose. In 
addition, it has revealed a plan to construct simplified 
disposal facilities for handling liquid radioactive wastes in 
Vladivostok and has asked Japan to provide financial support for 
this project. 
  In this connection, the Japanese Government, after careful 
review, has decided to extend several hundred million yen in 
financial assistance to help fund construction of a filtering 
device which is to become the core of the disposal facilities. 
The government plans to allocate funds for the project from a 
$100- million fund designated for dismantling nuclear weapons 
possessed by former Soviet states.

<F P=106> [Report by Murray Hiebert from Hanoi] </F>
  [Text] As Vietnam opens its economy to market forces, the 
cachet of foreign goods is on the rise. But conspicuous 
consumpton is only one of the problems Hanoi's bureaucrats now 
need to keep an eye on. They are quickly learning that the 
industrialized world has more to unload than champagne, 
computers and cars; it also has garbage. 
  Vietnam's customs officers are the last line of defense in a 
country belatedly acknowledging the need to sort the rich 
world's waste from its other goods offered. So when Tra Vinh 
Cereal and Foodstuff Co. asked the Customs Department to inspect 
its 61-container shipment of "assorted, mixed plastic," customs 
officers became curious when the shipment failed to show up. 
Eventually, the missing containers were located in early 
January at the Anh Sang Private Enterprise in the suburbs of Ho 
Chi Minh City. What they found was shocking even to the 
department's seasoned veterans: the "assorted, mixed plastic" 
turned out to be 1,114 tonnes of filthy, used plastic bags. 
  Fearing that Anh Sang would either try to recycle the 
bags--causing serious air and water pollution--or bury them in a 
landfill, Ho Chi Minh City's environment committee promptly 
ordered the bags to be re-exported to their original owner. (The 
environment committee said that the containers originated in 
Germany but wouldn't identify the names of any foreign companies 
involved with the shipment.) Vietnamese officials say this 
incident marks the first known case of foreign waste materials 
arriving in the country. But the desire to do so is not new. 
Government officials say many foreign companies have sought 
permission to dump their waste in Vietnam since Hanoi launched 
its free-market reforms seven years ago. 
  "Foreign companies try to exploit the poor knowledge of 
local 
officials by telling them these imports won't hurt Vietnam," 
says Nguyen Ngoc Sinh, acting director of Vietnam's National 
Environmental Agency. "They try to prove we will earn much money 
and be able to resolve our unemployment problem." These 
arguments appear to have won at least some converts. During the 
debate on an environmental protection law, passed by the 
National Assembly in late December, some delegates argued that 
Vietnam should consider accepting some solid-waste imports. In 
the end, their proposal was defeated. 
  The new environment law, Vietnam's first, seeks to prevent 
further degradation of the environment as the country rushes to 
develop in the wake of the communist party's retreat from 
command economics. But the law marks only the first halting 
step to protect an environment already battered by years of war, 
overcrowding and underdevelopment. 
  The law aims to provide a general framework for 
environmental 
protection. The task of developing concrete regulations on 
environmental problems such as industrial discharge, toxic gas, 
air standards and water quality has been assigned to the 
premier's office and to the National Environmental Agency, which 
falls under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. 
Hanoi already has adopted laws or promulgated decrees on the 
protection of forests, land and mineral resources. 
  Sinh hopes his office will have some preliminary guidelines 
in place within two months. One of the first new requirements 
established under the law is for factories to complete 
environmental impact assessment studies. Factories that don't 
take measures to meet minimum environmental requirements within 
a certain time will be ordered to stop operating. Licence won't 
be granted to new factories unles they meet these standards, 
Sinh says. 
  Although Vietnam's urban environ ment is still in better 
condition than those in most neighbouring countries, pollution 
is increasing rapidly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
Virtually no industries in either city, including those 
financed through foreign investment, treat any of their waste. 
An estimated 250 factories in Hanoi discharge untreated waste, 
including chemicals, dyes and some heavy metals, directly into 
the city's canals, river and lakes. Hanoi has no plant to treat 
waste water and its ageing waste-water network, built by the 
former French colonial rulers more than 50 years ago, serves 
only the old part of the city. This creates serious 
environmental risk, especially during the rainy season, when the 
streets are often flooded with a mixture of domestic waste 
water, industrial effluent and storm water. 
  In addition, Hanoi's factories pollute the air through the 
emission of coal particles sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
The heavily industrialised Thuong Dinh area in the southern 
suburbs suffers sulphur dioxide and carbor monoxide levels two 
to five times higher than permitted levels, according to an envi 
ronmental atlas completed in December by the city's Commission 
for Science, Technology and Environment and the Hanoi University 
of Civil Engineering. But as bad as the urban environment has 
become, Vietnam's densely populated rural areas are under even 
create environmental stress. Over the past five decades, the 
country's forest cover has declined from 44% of total land area 
to less than 24%, due to war, expansion of farmland, growing 
fuel needs and commercial logging. This massive deforestation 
has lead to large- scale soil erosion and increasing floods and 
drought. 
  Gibbons, leaf monkeys, slow lorises and other animals listed 
as "extremely threatened" by the Convention on the International 
Trade in Endangered Species are for sale in Vietnam's markets 
and smuggled to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Hunters have wiped 
out some 200 species of birds over the past four decades. And 
in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa alone, an estimated 50 
tonnes of coral reef, the habitat for a wide variety of marine 
life, are being destroyed each year to produce limestone for 
cement. 
  Although Vietnamese and foreign environmentalists laud the 
new environmental protection law, they point out that it won't 
change much unless Vietnam establishes a mechanism to enforce 
the regulations. Sinh says his department has only 40 experts-- 
"one- tenth of what I need"--and another 250 officials in 
provincial offices to monitor the country's environment. He 
expects a budget of only Dong 60 billion (US$5.5 million) this 
year. 
  Some observers wonder how effective environmental monitors 
will be unless their salaries are increased. "The people who 
destroy the forests now are the foresters," notes a foreign 
environmentalist. "If they're only paid US$15 a month, they have 
to find their own means of making a livelihood," he says, 
alluding to growing corruption among state employees. 
  A recent World Bank report argues that environmental 
protection in Vietnam also will require clear lines of authority 
and the elimination of unnecessary duplication of 
responsibility. For example, nine different national agencies 
currently play a role in establishing rules for the use of water. 
  Vietnam, like most of its neighbours, faces a dilemma: how 
to balance economic development with the cost of environmental 
protection. But unlike many other countries in Asia, Vietnam 
doesn't have the "luxury" of developing first and worrying about 
its environment later. 
  Vietnam has "very little environmental capital, such as 
forests, left to waste," observes a foreign economist. "Thailand 
could destroy its forests as its economy grew, but Vietnam's 
forests are already depleted. Further neglect is not really an 
option." 
  Vietnamese economists and environmentalists say the real 
underlying problem is that there is a limit to what they can do 
until the country achieves a higher level of economic 
development. 
  "I often talk to farmers about the value of protecting 
mangroves and wildlife," says Le Dien Duc of Hanoi University's 
Centre for Natural Resources Management and Environmental 
Studies. "They smile at me and say, your talk is very 
interesting, but we're starving. We have nothing to eat."

objective of the project is the protection of the environment of 
the city, famous for its cultural and historical interest, 
including its excellent museum. The project will also have an 
education component. Thus far the "Lvia" Project has 690 
employees. They are engaged in reforestation in the hills round 
the city, the improvement of roads, restoration of the "Rozafa" 
Castle, as well as work on hospitals, schools, libraries, and 
the city's museum. 
  "There is a good beginning," the director of Caritas for 
north Albania, Gjon Markagjoni, told ATA, adding that in the 
future the project will also cover the district of [word 
indistinct] and the communes of Lac and Vau i Dejes. The 
additional activity will increase the number of the workers by 
several hundred. 
  Three billion lira have been allocated by Italian bishoprics 
and the Italian Government to this joint undertaking. This sum 
will finance the Lvia Project for only several months, but, 
according to Markagjoni, the European Union will contribute to 
that project in the near future. The EU financing will permit 
the employment of additional workers and an expansion of project 
activities. Angjelin Muzhani, a Caritas representative, said 
that future plans for the project will also cover agriculture, 
especially vineyards.

  [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- Experts of the World 
Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 
the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency arrived on a visit to Bulgaria 
at the invitation of Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski. 
The visit will last until February 17. 
  The mission, led by Spyros Margetis, senior environmental 
specialist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank, will 
survey the implementation of the plan of action which is part of 
Bulgaria's environmental strategy. The plan, specifying the 
main aspects of this country's environmental policy until the 
year 2000, was developed in 1991 by Bulgarian specialists with 
the assistance of experts of the same financial institutions and 
agencies. Some of the foreign experts are members of the 
present mission. The plan will be updated to bring it into line 
with the changes that took place in Bulgaria over the last few 
years. Stress will be laid on the development of an investment 
matrix specifying the ways and mechanisms of attracting 
investment for the implementation of the updated plan of action. 
The draft update is expected to be ready by the end of March. 
  Bulgaria would like to show it pursues a consistent 
environmental policy conducting cooperation with the 
international financial and political institutions concerned 
with the problems of environment at the 1995 Conference on 
European Environment which Sofia is to host, Environment 
Minister Bosevski said today before the opening of the working 
meeting with the foreign experts. He stressed that Bulgaria 
seeks integration with the financial and political mechanisms of 
Europe and the world for the purpose of optimizing its 
environmental policy. As hosts to the 1995 environmental 
conference, we want to make our own contribution to the 
formulation of the concept about environmental policy, Minister 
Bosevski added. 
  World Bank resident representative John Wilton, who attended 
the opening of the meeting, said that the updated plan of action 
could also provide an input to the meeting of international 
donors organized by the World Bank in June this year. The idea 
of both meetings is to provide assistance for those priority 
actions that are to be taken in the environmental area, Mr. 
Wilton stressed. 
  Minister Bosevski expressed his hope that during the 
mission's visit a national group would be established to draw up 
Bulgaria's report for the 1995 conference. "This national team 
would act as a coordinator of relations with the countries in 
Central and Eastern Europe which are expected to raise a number 
of social, political and economic problems at the forum," the 
Bulgarian environment minister said. 
  Apart from the Environment Ministry team, the mission of 
experts will also meet representatives of state and academic 
institutions and non-government environmental formations.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The environmentalist 
movement Duha [Rainbow] is demanding an explanation from the 
government and the Czech Power Company, CEZ, on why it has been 
concealing sections of international reports casting doubt on 
the Temelin nuclear power station. 
  At a press conference today, Duha member Jan Beranek claimed 
the movement had obtained from the Library of the European Union 
a copy of a report conducted by the Belgian company Tractebel 
and financed by PHARE-Energy. The first part of the report has 
been frequently cited by the Czech Government because the 
completion of the Temelin plant in southern Bohemia is described 
as the cheapest way of meeting the national energy requirement, 
he said. 
  The second part, however, which deals with energy saving 
possibilities in the Czech Republic, is suppressed, Beranek 
claimed. The report concludes that investment into energy saving 
measures would cost less than the production of electricity by 
any method, including Temelin. 
  A second study -- by the German Society for Nuclear Safety 
-- 
observed that progress at the Temelin site was in fact very much 
less advanced than officially claimed. It also produced a 
higher cost estimate for the conversion and completion of 
Temelin than has been published in the Czech Republic, Beranek 
said. 
  Duha also pointed to a World Bank report from January this 
year which allegedly showed that loans offered to the Czech 
Republic for the desulfurization of coal power stations in north 
Bohemia (the loans were called "Energy II") and for the 
recultivation of disused open cast mines ("Environment") were 
suspended because of the "unconfirmed interest of the Czech 
Government." 
  The decision will definitely slow the environmental clean-up 
of northern Bohemia, Beranek said. He added that the Czech 
Government had granted a state guarantee to the completion of 
Temelin probably at the expense of the desulfurization of the 
coal plants.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 28 (CTK) -- The Environment Ministry is 
willing, on condition that terms stipulated by Minister 
Frantisek Benda are met, to consider completing the Temelin 
nuclear plant and bringing into operation, the Ministry's 
Spokesman Frantisek Stanek told CTK today. 
  Stanek was commenting in reaction to the decision by the 
American EX-IM Bank to provide guarantees for the completion of 
Temelin. 
  Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia, 
started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been 
strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially 
in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are 
involved in the project. 
  The Ministry's positive attitude is conditioned by the 
passing of a nuclear law, an energy law, and laws on the plant's 
decommissioning, insurance against possible nuclear damage and 
state supervision of nuclear material, Stanek announced. 
  The EX-IM Bank does not observe the rules it requires in 
other cases, Jindrich Petrlik, a representative of the 
environmental groups Duha (Rainbow) and Deti Zeme (Children of 
the Earth), stated. The projects for which the loans were 
granted should be in line with Americans standards, he said, 
adding that Temelin plant does not comply with them. 
  The activities against granting the guarantees for the loan 
to complete Temelin plant will be continued also in the United 
States and Greenpeace hopes that the congress will not recommend 
providing guarantee for the loan, Vera Frankova, the Greenpeace 
spokeswoman, told CTK. 
  The board of the EX-IM Bank approved guarantees for loans on 
American export worth $317 million for the completion and 
modernization of the safety equipment for Temelin plant, 
originally Soviet-designed. 
  The EX-IM Bank must hand the whole project to congress which 
has 35 days to assess any transaction of the bank regarding 
nuclear energy before.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 23 (CTK) -- Greenpeace and two Czech 
environmentalist groups, Duha (RAINBOW) and Deti Zeme (Children 
of the Earth), have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional 
Court against the Government and the Trade and Industry Ministry 
over the Temelin power station, the groups' legal representative 
Petr Kuzvart told CTK today. 
  Last March when the Ministry of Trade and Industry was 
preparing material in advance of a government decision on the 
Temelin plant in southern Bohemia, the ministry clearly had 
information that a study on the economic feasibility of the 
plant had been commissioned from the Belgian company Tractabel 
Kuzvart said. 
  Part of the report studied the possibilities of energy 
saving 
and concluded that energy saving procedures would cost the 
country less than the production of electricity by any method. 
By 2010, the report stated, 3,500 megawatts could technically 
be saved, it would be economically advantageous to save 3,000 
megawatts but the feasible saving by that year is only 1,200 
megawatts. 
  The study shows that the amount of energy saving possible is 
six times higher than Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir 
Dlouhy announced, Kuzvart said. 
  Other government offices and constitutional officials had no 
information about this section of the study before the decision 
was taken to complete Temelin, as is shown by Environment 
Minister Frantisek Benda's proposal that a study be done 
including energy sources and needs and assessing the realistic 
energy saving potential, Kuzvart said. 
  The government could only have made the announcement that, 
with coal power plants cutting production, a new source 
producing around 2,00 megawatts had to be found, if the 
Tractabel study had not been taken into account, he said. 
  In the interests of averting looming environmental damage 
construction at Temelin should not have been resumed before new 
discussions, Kuzvart said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 24--Environmental protection ministers 
of Poland and Ukraine, Stanislaw Zelichowski and Yuriy Kostenko 
respectively, signed an agreement on cooperation in environment 
protection and another agreement on turnover in dangerous wastes. 
  We want to use experience gained in this field by Poland, a 
country much more advanced in improving the legal system, 
management and the utilization of natural resources, Yuriy 
Kostenko said. 
  He added that the Ukrainian side is counting on Polish 
experience in the creation of an environment monitoring system 
and the prevention of the transfer of dangerous wastes. 
"Ukraine, like Poland, has become the target place where 
Western Europe and especially Germany dispose their wastes.'' 
  Minister Zelichowski, at whose invitation Yuriy Kostenko 
arrived in Poland, said that the cooperation with 
Ukraine--started in 1990-- has been going smoothly. 
  Chief environment protection inspector Andrzej Walewski 
reported that so far attempts at smuggling about 37 tons of 
dangerous wastes from Germany to Ukraine have been foiled. The 
Polish side has several times informed the Ukrainian side about 
such attempts and about taking preventive measures. 
  He added that the Polish side has not allowed to transfer to 
Poland about 30 tons of dangerous wastes from Ukraine.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 Feb (MTI) -- The Hungarian Army and the 
Ministry of the Interior's Fire and Civil Defence National 
Command have set up an Accident Information Centre in Budapest, 
in order to avert nuclear accidents and catastrophes. 
  The centre, to work as part of the operation staff of the 
nuclear accident prevention government committee, is to 
coordinate the national radiation monitoring, signalling and 
control systems of the two organizations. 
  The network is to provide continuous information from 60 
points throughout the country on the radioactive radiation 
level. The measuring stations are to measure the gamma doses in 
the air, which is termed harmful to health if measuring 500 
nanosievert per hour. (measurements between 1000 and 5000 nsv 
were registered in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear 
accident.) 
  With the decline in the danger of nuclear explosions and 
nuclear attacks, the accident information centre will mainly 
focus on nuclear power plant accidents, the delivery of nuclear 
materials, and possible meteorite impacts. 
  The majority of the measuring stations will be operated near 
barracks, as they are affiliated to the army, however, the 
Central Physics Research Institute of Budapest and the Paks 
Nuclear Power Plant (southern Hungary) will also carry out 
measurements. Data will be continuously evaluated and stored in 
the centre, and if higher than average figures are reported, 
immediate measures can be taken by involving the civil defence 
and army units.

<F P=106> [Robert Corzine report: "Green Space in the Tunisian Desert"] </F>
  [Text] Tourists seeking a sleepy or swinging Mediterranean 
resort would be disappointed if they took the turning into the 
southern Tunisian town of Sfax. 
  A stinging smog bathes the industrial city, the result of a 
steady pall of smoke coming from a nearby phosphate plant. A 
mountain of gypsum, the waste product from the process, 
dominates the skyline. It is also the source of pollutants 
which have leached their way through to the nearby sea to kill 
much of the local marine life. 
  The casual visitor might think that a new oil derrick or two 
sticking up above the sprawling town and its hundreds of small 
metal and furniture workshops and car repair yards would do 
little to spoil the scenery. Yet local environmental concerns 
have been one of the strongest influences on British Gas's 
approach to its second-largest foreign project to date. 
  The need to persuade sceptical Tunisian officials that 
British Gas's operations in and around Sfax would not create a 
new source of pollution to rival the phosphate plant was a 
constant theme during years of negotiations, according to Jack 
Barnes, the British engineer who oversaw the company's growing 
involvement in Tunisia from 1989 until his recent retirement. 
  British Gas's presence in Tunisia stems from its purchase in 
1988 of the international oil and gas assets of Tenneco, the US 
company. In 1991, it discovered the Rhemoura oil field which 
underlies Sfax. Offshore oil finds were made in 1992. The 
company began development work on the 500m pounds offshore 
Miskar gas field south of Sfax late last year, and expects the 
first Miskar gas to flow in 1995. 
  The company's 40m pounds investment in oil production in the 
area is much smaller than the Miskar project, which includes a 
large land-based processing plant. But the company knew that 
the way in which it ran its oil operations would indicate to 
sceptical local officials how it might handle the much larger 
and more politically sensitive gas field development. 
  Producing oil in urban areas has long been a practice in the 
US, where "nodding donkey" pumping units can be seen in settings 
as varied as supermarket car parks and behind false building 
facades in Hollywood. British Gas engineers studied sites in 
Texas and Florida to help ensure that the operations in Sfax 
caused a minimum of disruption. 
  In Sfax, as elsewhere, public concerns centred around 
possible inconvenience and safety. British Gas held a series of 
town meetings to explain its proposals. Gaining the support of 
the regional governor was also a priority according to Barnes, 
especially as one of the first exploratory wells was drilled in 
a field next to his official residence. 
  The long wires needed for seismic testing were laid along 
streets and alleyways at night and had to be picked up before 
dawn to avoid people who were going to work. "It was a tedious 
and cumbersome process," according to William Lehmann, general 
manager of oil operations. "We had to be particularly careful 
when doing the thumping" that sends the seismic waves into the 
ground. 
  The complex geologic structure of the latest exploration 
well 
now being drilled in Sfax required the use of oil-based mud to 
lubricate drill bits and to carry rock cuttings back to the 
surface. 
  There was no local hazardous waste disposal site, so British 
Gas had to seek its own solution. 
  The contaminated cuttings are taken to a bio-remediation 
site 
the company built south of Sfax where Joe Frank Dean, a former 
rodeo cowboy from New Mexico, herds millions of bacteria which 
eat their way through the toxic particles. The clean cuttings 
and nutrient wastes are then tilled into nearby farm land. 
  The process of convincing the Tunisians that British Gas 
intended to follow the best environmental practices in all its 
activities extended to arranging visits by leading Tunisian 
officials to similar British Gas facilities in the UK. 
  The company even looked at ways in which the mountain of 
gypsum could be used, going so far as to find a second-hand 
plant in the US which could be shipped over to convert the waste 
into road aggregate. But a shortage of cash in Tunisia put paid 
to the scheme. 
  Company officials were determined that no comparisons could 
be made between the much maligned phosphate plant and its own 
gas processing facility. A helicopter search of the coast 
produced a site that promised to be as inconspicuous as 
possible. The plant, hidden from the main coastal road by a 
small hill and a belt of olive trees, will occupy only 15 
hectares of the 69 hectare site. 
  It is at the Hannibal processing site, however, that British 
Gas's environmental strategy came unstuck, although ironically 
in a way which is unlikely to raise many local concerns. 
  The "sour" gas from the Miskar field contains large amounts 
of sulphur, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and liquid condensates 
which require lengthy processing to remove. The extracted 
sulphur and condensates will be sold separately from the clean 
gas. 
  But British Gas engineers were stumped when they looked for 
economic ways in which to dispose of the carbon dioxide, a 
suspected greenhouse gas. Re-injection of the gas was 
considered, but there were serious doubts about the technology 
involved and worries that the cost would make an already 
marginal project uneconomic, according to Richard Hart, 
operations manager. 
  The result is that 1.10 million cubic meters of carbon 
dioxide -- a "fair amount" concedes Hart -- will be released 
into the atmosphere each day.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Coulloudon in Moscow: "Russia: </F>
Chemical Threat: The Terrible Secret"] 
  [Text] Is the Russian chemical bomb a state secret or is it 
an open secret? In Moscow, Professor Vil Mirzayanov is paying 
with his freedom for his attempt to break the sacrosanct laws of 
secrecy and reveal to the general public what the experts have 
known for a long time. This is a curious fate for this Doctor 
Strangelove-type character, yesterday an honored scientist and 
today sharing his cell with common murderers! 
  The scandal came from where it was least expected. For 
decades, a handful of scientists have been working to develop 
the most lethal neuroparalysis gases that boast an effectiveness 
greater than that achieved by American experts. Guardians of 
the destructive formulae, they are now, however, threatening to 
reveal all in response to a sudden philanthropic impulse and the 
feeling that they have been conned and exploited by their 
superiors. The first revelation is that Russia has many more 
toxic substances than it officially admits to. At the Paris 
convention on chemical weapons signed last year, the Kremlin 
undertook to release the figures for its arsenal. It admitted to 
storing 40,000 tonnes of various substances, 32,000 tonnes of 
which were neuroparalytic. Vladimir Uglev, one of the three 
protesting scientists and one of the fathers of the binary bomb, 
states, however, that Moscow has already produced 80,000 tonnes 
of mustard gas alone -- the gas used for the first time at Ypres 
in Belgium and which was the terror of the infantrymen gassed by 
the Germans. 
  For these dissidents of military chemistry, the proof that 
Russia lied about the amount of chemical weapons it has is to be 
found at Chikhaniy, in the Saratov region not far from the 
Volga. Away from prying eyes, a constant stream of explosions 
releases thick clouds of toxic substances into the atmosphere. 
It is here that the army destroys its excess of chemical 
weapons before Western observers can notice the deception. All 
this occurs to the detriment of the most basic safety rules. 
  It is claimed that whole vats of toxic substances are buried 
or burned without any safety measures whatsoever. No surprise 
then, that it is at Chikhaniy that the highest number of 
ophthalmic lesions and eye cancers are recorded -- twice as many 
as in the rest of the country. 
  State secrecy means that medical information for the regions 
concerned also remains a closely guarded secret. However, we do 
know that a number of soldiers who took part in the destruction 
of mustard gas at the Kambark base in the sixties have since 
died of cancer. Near the Novocheboksariy region of central 
Russia, almost 90 percent of the population suffers from various 
types of pathological illness. In 1993, the 12,000 children of 
Chikhaniy developed twice as many respiratory illnesses as in 
the previous year while the number of complications 
quadrupled.... 
  In the east, the largest threat posed by the military 
chemical industry does not, however, lie simply in this 
half-truth. Russia has two powerful binary weapons capable of 
wiping out entire populations when their internal membrane 
splits to mix two individually inoffensive gases. The first of 
these weapons, named VX, is produced using chemical substances 
that are banned by the Paris convention and which should soon be 
destroyed. The second weapon, on the other hand, is the most 
fearful arm ever dreamed up in this domain -- fearful because it 
is untouchable. 
  According to Vladimir Uglev, the developer of the gas 
code-named A-232, the weapon's originality lies in the 
simplicity of its components which are used in civilian industry 
and which cannot therefore be regulated by international 
experts. "We know that the chemical parameters of such a weapon 
cannot escape the clutches of the generals or terrorists for 
long," Vladimir Uglev accepts. "The question is whether to make 
its composition public knowledge and so demand strict 
international control, or else wait for a `leak' to occur, 
despite our vigilance." 
  By concealing the results obtained during the A-232 research 
and accusing the developers of these weapons of "violating state 
secrecy," the Kremlin seems to have opted for the latter 
solution.

<H5>  RUSSIA IN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS </H5>
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  This book is a concern and a challenge. The concern is on 
the 
future of the environment of our planet and Russia on it. The 
challenge is to the environmental stereotypes dominating in the 
world. 
  The idea to prepare this book came in 1989. Enormous changes 
going on in both Russia and on the whole territory of the former 
Soviet Union have triggered it. Old stereotypes were collapsing, 
paradigmes were changing, and the authors of the book could more 
easily renounce some environmental and economic concepts 
dominated and still dominating the world. 
  An important incentive to create this book has been the fact 
that the assessment of consumption and preemption of the primary 
biological production by mankind at the global level had been 
evaluated and published in Russia (word in Russian, 1980) well 
before the widely cited paper of P. Vitousek et al. (1986) with 
very similar conclusions appeared. Though the significance of 
the Gorshkov's publication has not been properly appreciated by 
the community of experts in the issues of global environment 
even in Russia, its conclusions have influenced the 
environmental thinking in our country. That could not but make 
the authors to think over the eternal question: Where do we go? 
  An important event without which this book could not have 
been created was the crucial step from rather general statements 
on the theorical existence of limits for economical activity 
within the biosphere to the quantitative estimation of it along 
within the indication of when mankind stepped over this most 
important bound (Russian word, 1987; Russian words, 1990). It 
will be shown in this book that crossing this ecological 
borderline has occurred time ego [as published] and that the 
global environmental change observed the last decades 
worrisomely confirms it. 
  The competition between the two main economic systems in the 
world is over-signifying the defeat of the centrally planned 
economy. The latter requires higher management expenditures but 
it is quickly out of order as soon as the tight central control 
is loosened. Its functioning does not correspond to the main 
principle of sustainable functioning of both the biosphere and 
the human society which is the self- controlled and finely tuned 
balance of matter and energy fluxes within the system, that is 
the sustenance of a homeostasis. 
  It turned out also that the centrally planned economic 
system 
is more wasteful in terms of the natural resources use. However, 
the market economy is not able to solve the global environmental 
problems either. To fulfil the needs of predominantly 
poverty-striken planet's growing population, both systems 
strived for quick and massive production lavishly depleting 
natural resources. 
  A reality of today is that we face a collapsing world being 
in a state of severe environmental crisis and converting into an 
overall crisis of our civilisation. The strategy of sustainable 
development (Our Common Future, 1987; and many other 
publications) is an attempt to handle the crisis. It is the main 
stereotype of our time based in fact on expectation of a 
miracle: sustainable development is an endeavour to minimize 
man's impact on the environment in an expectation that the 
life-supporting system would maintain its main functions until 
the population of the Earth stabilizes at the level exceeding 
two or more times the present one and would keep on after that. 
It is doubtful whether the miracle would ever happen. 
  A political foundation of the sustainable development 
strategy is a desire to preserve the status quo in the world 
correcting and mending the present world system and postponing 
the moment of the unpleasant truth. The truth is that the 
sustainable development strategy is certainly progressive for 
some transitional period but in the long run it all the same 
drives mankind to the ecological impasse, that is to the 
extinction of man as a biological species. 
  The authors are far away from the point that the economic 
growth or the technological revolution are the culprits of the 
emerging global environmental catastrophe. Renouncing that 
civilisation can be compared with jumping out of a speeding 
train, that is perishing. The main reason of the crisis is in 
the excessively grown population of the planet. It has increased 
to such an extent that its stabilization even at the present 
level would not bring the biosphere back to the pre-crisis 
sustainable state. This statement is also a challenge of a kind 
because this approach does not correspond to the deep-rooted 
ideologies, religions and ethical norms based on the usual 
personal anthropocentrism. The issues of the population growth 
and control are, of course, very sensitive political problems 
and the interrelation of the planet's overpopulation and the 
global environmental crisis often are not put on the foreground. 
  Uprecedented complexity and the world-wide scale of the 
problem of mankind's survival under the environmental crisis 
predetermine a crucial need of the international cooperation. It 
is the objective of the United Conference on Environment and 
Development. The UNCED has become one of the reason to publish 
this book now. 
  The structure of the book is determined by the concept 
expressed above. It consists of two parts. The first one is 
devoted to an analysis of the world's development, particularly 
during the last forty years. Social and environmental 
implications of the development are discussed. An original 
concept of environmental security is suggested. Basing on this 
concept the present state of the world environment is 
characterized as an acute ecological crisis. 
  In the second part the state of the environment in Russia is 
discussed keeping in mind that it is a large part of the world 
system. State of the environment in Russia is regarded in the 
framework of the concept of environmental security suggested in 
the first part. To describe the ecological situation in Russia, 
the Reports of the Environment of the former USSR as well as the 
Statistical Reference Book have been used. They contain for the 
first time many data unpublished earlier. The main assessments 
are for 1989, as the text of the book was being prepared in 1990. 
<H5>  Part 1. Environmental Imperative </H5>
  The end of the XXth century can be characterised by the 
drastic changes in the relations between the two principal state 
and economic system. It is the result of historic development 
which has stimulated the human society as a whole and every 
individual human being on Earth to work out a new mentality. The 
basic effect of the new mentality is the fact that, due to the 
efforts of both East and West, the world has been brought to a 
considerable relaxation of its former ideological, political and 
military confrontation. This has made it possible to solve the 
most important ecological problem: a strong decrease of the 
probability, and hopefully the elimination of potential 
large-scale nuclear conflict and its catastrophic consequences 
for the biosphere and humanity. This opens up possibilities not 
only for the transition from narrow-minded national or group 
mentality to global-scale human thinking, but also for stable 
peaceful development instead of former confrontation. In these 
conditions, the global environment security becomes imperative. 
  The radical relaxation of global military threat puts 
forward 
the basic problem of mankind: its survival under the progressive 
environmental crisis. Beginning 1960s, the scientific, and later 
also political language became characteristic of frequent 
expressions of the type of "ecological calamity," "environmental 
catastrophe," "ecological problem," "environmental safety." They 
have become part of every day language of newspapers, 
periodicals and television. Scientists and politicians who are 
concerned about the state of the biosphere constantly speak in 
these terms. These are not expressions "just in fashion" or a 
product of propagandistic verbal drive; they are indicators of 
general anxiety of people who already suffer from the pressure 
of environmental problems. The subject of ecology often sets 
aside other problems, occupying the leading position both on 
national, and the international scale. Areas of the globe, 
environmental problems have become predominant. 
  Environmental problems have arisen as a result of the 
evolution of our civilization. The patterns of human behaviour 
within the society and in the interaction with the environment 
have been worked out in earlier times when [they] were capable 
of ensuring environmental sustainability. Recently, they have 
come into conflict with the new conditions caused by the 
technological revolution. In the new conditions, in response to 
the challenge on the part of environmental change, it becomes 
necessary to form a new pattern of behaviour and new moral 
preferences, and to revise former objectives of socio- economic 
development. 
<H5>  Problems of Socio-Economic Development </H5>
  After the Second World War was over, the world seemed to 
have 
entered a phase of constant by advancing economical progress. 
The world production increased by a factor of 5 during the 
postwar period: the additional economical increase for each 
decade was equal to the production output obtained over the 
entire period from the start of our civilization to the 1950s. 
For the period mentioned, the agricultural production increased 
by a factor of 2.6, and the population grew from 2.5 to 5.3 
billion. The population growth rate increase from 50 to 84 
million per year. During the same time period, the production of 
food per capita increased by a factor of 1.25, whereas the 
industrial production output increased by a factor of 3 or 4 
[19]. 
  A great number of new technologies have been developed. Such 
new technological systems as electronic and space ones have been 
worked out; efficient medical aids against many widespread 
diseases have been obtained; a new way of life has been formed 
in the society which can be called "an information society." 
  However, not every part of the world could be characterised 
as that of rapid economic development. In many developing 
countries tragic social consequences took place in the course of 
the technological revolution. Seven hundred fifty million people 
on this planet are starving today, while another 1,225 million 
suffer from real poverty. In developing countries, 95% of 
children are born, live and die in poverty, being deprived of 
the benefits of the scientific and technological achievements. 
About 2 billion people suffer from water shortage and have to 
use unhealthy water; the low quality of water is the cause of 
various diseases [7]. The outbreaks of the diseases which had 
been declared as eliminated (cholera, malaria), have been 
registered again. New diseases have appeared, the most dangerous 
of which, so far, is AIDS. The number of the poor and homeless 
in developed countries is growing as well. Drugs addiction, 
violence and terrorism are spreading there. The number of 
technological scientists has increased sharply; the number of 
genetic and blood diseases grows, as well as that of malignant 
tumours. 
  Differences between the North and the South with regard to 
population growth have become more pronounced. In 1950 about 
22% of the global population lived in North America and 
Europe, 
and only about 9% in Africa. Now the proportion is 
reversed. 
The Southern developing countries comprise the major part of the 
world population. The debt of this part of the world amounts to 
1,200 billion US dollars, which constitutes about one half of 
the gross national product of the debtor countries. Poverty and 
starvation, diseases and general frustration are doubtless 
fraught with unpredictable conflicts and violence. There 
appeared numerous environmental refugees. The shortage of land 
and water resources is obvious, and this can cause conflicts and 
provoke wars. Worrisome features of development have appeared in 
the late 1980s. This has become the first time since 1950 when 
the crop yield has stopped increasing the grain production 
output has dropped, and the areas of arable and irrigated land 
per capita have decreased. If, according to Adam Smith, "an 
invisible hand" appears to regulate the population growth this 
hand is most likely to bring about the destruction of the 
biosphere followed by starvation and diseases. 
  The 40 years of technological progress has entailed an 
enormous impact on the environment, since this progress had been 
based on ruthless exploitation of natural resources. Economic 
estimations have practically never taken into account the 
depletion and damage to natural resources, or their direct 
consequence which is the harmful effect on human health. 
Moreover, the future generations will be deprived of their share 
of natural resources. And as a result, the biosphere has been 
considerably disturbed. 
  The resources depleting technologies have proved to be the 
most competitive both under the conditions of a free market and 
in the centrally planned systems. 
  The economic progress of the last 40 years has provided to 
be 
catastrophic for the state of the biosphere. Twenty percent of 
the fertile topsoil of cultivated land have been lost 
completely; 20% of tropical forests have been cleared; the 
process of desertification continues at the rate of 6 million 
hectares annually, and deforestation amounts to 11 million 
hectares a year. The CO[.sup]2[/] concentration in the 
atmosphere increased by 13% during the last 40 years; the 
protective ozone layer is reduced annually by 2%, and 
every 
spring there appears the so-called ozone hole over the 
Antarctic, in fact a sharp drop in the ozone content. Dead lakes 
and damaged forests have now become inevitable components of the 
landscape in industrial countries. Most rivers and brooks in 
Europe and North America remain polluted during the entire year. 
In many cases, pollutants are mostly brought to water bodies not 
so much the local sources, but due to dry and wet deposition 
from the atmosphere. The other source is the runoff from 
cropland where from 50% of fertilizers and pesticides are 
washed out. Dangerous toxics, such as heavy metals, pesticide 
decomposition products, plastics, radionuclides, etc., are 
accumulated in soil, in bottom sediments, as well as in plants 
and animals. Every day over a hundred species disappear 
altogether, the process being particularly intensive in tropical 
forests. On the whole the humans consume up to 40% of the 
biological primary production created by photosynthesis, thus 
depriving of food a great number of living organisms [2,20]. 
  Due to the differences in their socio-economic development, 
the developing and developed countries affect the environment in 
a different way, but always negatively. Less developed 
countries, due to the poverty, rapid population growth and 
technological inadequacy, cause the degradation of land, forest 
and non-renewable resources. Developed countries possess the 
bulk of industrial and energy potential of the world; they are 
the main consumers of resources (particularly, the energy 
resources) and the main suppliers of pollutants. For example, in 
1988 in North America the CO[.sup]2[/] emissions to the 
atmosphere exceeded those in Africa by a factor of 6, in Latin 
America, by 2.5 times and in South-East Asia, by a factor of 9. 
  The tendencies described above call to the reassessment of 
the socio- economic development during the last 40 years; these 
decades should be seen as the period of considerable social 
degradation and strong aggravation of the global environmental 
crisis. A thorough analysis of this situation is necessary on 
the eve of the UN Conference on Environment and Development to 
be held in Brazil, 1-12 June, 1992. 
<H5>  Seeking for Problem-Solving Strategies </H5>
  Leaders of many states often raise ecological problems; a 
great deal of top-level meetings have produced declarations on 
the environment. The greatest attention was probably attracted 
to the Bruntland report and to the outcome of the Second World 
Climate Conference. Quite many scientific conferences were held, 
a good deal of programmes worked out, and specific agreements 
signed. However, just as before, rhetorics mostly prevail over 
actions. Uncertainty is generally felt as to the ways of solving 
ecological problems, developing strategies for environmental 
safety and means to guarantee sustainable development. 
  Assessments of the current global environmental situation 
vary from optimistic ones ("It is necessary to prevent a 
possible environmental crisis") to moderately pessimistic ones 
("The planet is on the threshold of crisis"). At regional 
levels, however, the most pessimistic assessments have been 
given, such as "a severe environmental crisis," etc. Many 
experts concerned with the ecological problems discuss the 
issues of permissible loads on ecosystems, but they do not give 
any unambiguous answer to the question what are the limits of 
the loads on the ecosystems or on the biosphere as a whole. 
There are declarations claiming that it is possible "to feed a 
population of 10 billion people and more." But the estimations 
are not based on accurate analysis of the environmental 
conditions in which the 10 billion people are supposed to live, 
if they are able to survive at all. 
  These questions should be answered, and the answers 
formulated within the concept of environmental safety. However, 
the concept of environmental safety has not been adequately 
formulated so far, nor have the answers been given to the 
above-posed questions, except a few suggestions [2-5, 15]. There 
are two concepts of environmental safety that are being 
considered at the present. The first, more popular one is based 
on the idea that ecological problems and environmental changes 
are related to wrong management of the economy. Therefore, the 
economy should be modified to make it "ecologically safe" and 
not harmful for the environment that is the technology should be 
wasteless and "ecologically clean" energy sources should be used. 
  The other concept of environmental safety proceeds from an 
intuitive belief that it is necessary to conserve a certain part 
of biosphere and keep it free from any economic activity. It is 
assumed that this part of biosphere is necessary to keep in 
order to sustain the environment. But no assessments are given 
as to the threshold areas of the preserved territories for 
sustained biosphere. 
  The first concept actually admits the possibility of 
complete 
destruction of the natural biosphere, since it assumes an 
unlimited economic activity which would not result in the 
degradation of the environment. A solution of any environmental 
problem is assumed to be possible through using adequate methods 
of economic development and the utilisation of efficient 
environmental management systems. 
  The second concept proposes the solution of the problem 
through preservation of parts of the biosphere against its 
possible destruction. The final objective of both concepts is 
provision of equilibrium and wasteless management. To accomplish 
the task, however, an enormous control system of unprecedented 
complexity and scale would be needed, which could ensure a 
sustainable development in the absence of unperturbed biota 
functioning according to the Le Chatelier principle [2,5]. Thus, 
there is no essential difference between both concepts. Systems 
of this type are often referred to as the noosphere. Estimations 
of the information flows to be processed by such a control 
system, and of expenditures required for its operation shows us 
that such a system cannot be practically realised. If the system 
had been created, however, the maintaining of its stability 
would have required over 99% of the total energy and 
labour 
produced by mankind. 
  Recently, a new concept has been proposed which attributes 
the appearance of environmental problems to excessive 
consumption. Today, the output of matters per capita resulted 
from mining, industry, agriculture and forest catting amounts to 
20 tons annually. Subsequent processing of these 20 tons of raw 
materials requires 2.5X03 of energy power and 800 tons of water. 
The final products intended for direct consumption are about 2 
tons. The remaining part is direct (technological) wastes, 
whereas the 2 tons of final products are delayed wastes. The 
concept assumes that the problem might be solved by reducing 
individual consumption. In reality, however, the optimal 
individual consumption value in a modern industrial society does 
not exceed the basic needs of a human being, which are necessary 
to maintain an adequate standard of living. For example, it is 
obvious that it is impossible to live in a multistorey apartment 
house without elevators, water supplies or sewage facilities. 
Therefore, to call for the individual reduction of consumption 
would be similar to the call for the refusal from civilisation. 
  It is unlikely that such a strategy of survival would be 
supported by the public opinion, and that the propaganda of this 
principle would receive a positive response, since these ideas 
do not comply with the natural needs and aspirations of a human 
being. In all times, various religions and ideologies used to 
take account of these aspirations, while calling for temporary 
absence and promising in the end "a Golden Age," "Heaven," 
"Liberty, equality and fraternity" or even "to everyone 
according to his needs." The strategy of reduced consumption 
promises nothing but (at first sight) a gloomy future. 
  Each of concepts described above has a rational core: the 
first one relates environmental problems to the economic 
activity; the second one proceeds from the assumption that the 
sustainability of the severely perturbed but controlled 
biosphere is the basic for survival; the third concept states 
that [it] is consumption that causes environmental degradation 
rather than its final stage which is population. Besides, this 
last concept shifts the center of gravity in solving 
environmental problems from the spheres of technology and 
economy to that of human behaviour. Not a single one of these 
concepts, however, offers an unambiguous solution of the problem 
outlined. Nevertheless, the solution concepts of environmental 
safety, refusal from the outdated "ecological" stereotypes, 
alteration of the environmental paradigm. 
<H5>  Biosphere: The Guarantor of Life Conservation </H5>
  The objective, the environmental research is a guedt [as 
printed] for sustainable conditions of life for humans of the 
present and future generations. To determine what these 
conditions are, the genetic and cultural heredity of man should 
be investigated. Humans exist in the environment, and have been 
able to establish empirically long ago that environmental 
degradation deprives man of normal living conditions. This puts 
forward an essentially new problem: whether the communities of 
natural species in the biosphere determine the state of the 
environment in which human beings exist and whether carbon and 
nutrients concentrations in the environment are occasional 
factors for the biota, or they are formed by the biota itself 
and maintained at a level optimal for the life [2, 17]. If the 
biologically controlled sustainability of the environment 
exists, there arises a need for conservation of the communities 
of natural species in the biosphere and of determination of the 
threshold values for non-sustained perturbations of the 
biosphere. If this [is] not the case, then the environmental 
problem is reduced entirely to that of management of the economy. 
  It is a known fact that the carbon and nutrients 
concentrations in the environment can change by 100% due 
to 
geophysical processes taking place during of about 100,000 
years. Therefore, during the Phanerozoic era, for example, the 
concentrations could have varied by hundreds of times, thus 
making impossible the existence of any form of life. The fact 
that this has never happened points out to the controlling role 
of the biosphere. The thin "film" of life on the Earth's surface 
becomes a filter which regulates concentrations of the carbon 
and nutrients providing a biogeochemical equilibrium with an 
exceedingly high accuracy up to hundredths of one percent 
(10[.sup]- 4[/]). The mechanism of this regulation is ensured 
under natural biodiversity conditions due to the synthesis of 
organic matter from inorganic one and decomposition of organic 
matter into inorganic components. It is worth mentioning here 
that, according to the existing predictions, about a million 
species of plants and animals are under the danger of extinction 
over the next 2-3 decades. 
  The characteristic time of cycles for the basic elements in 
the environment due to biologic production and destruction is of 
the order of 10 years, i.e., it is 10[.sup]4[/] times shorter 
than that of geophysical processes. Therefore, the biota can 
compensate the external perturbations or occasional fluctuations 
of the environmental properties over a short time period. The 
conclusion is supported by the sustainability of the environment 
observed over long time periods of about a thousand years. 
  The biota compensates the growth of inorganic matter 
concentration in the environment by transforming this matter 
into low active organic forms, but, if necessary, the biota 
increases inorganic concentrations by decomposing organic matter 
to restore the closed nature of the biogeochemical cycles. This 
property of the natural biota is similar to the functioning of 
the Le Chatelier principle which provides physically and 
chemically sustained equilibrium states [2, 18]. It is obvious 
that, in order to provide this control, the reserves of carbon 
and nutrients in organic and inorganic compounds of the 
environment should be of the same order of magnitude, which is 
actually the case for most elements. 
  Continuous processes of the biological synthesis and 
decomposition sustain the environment in non-equilibrium 
physical and chemical states which are easily disturbed in case 
of severe perturbations or destruction of the biota. For 
instance, the chemical composition of the atmosphere is in a 
state of non-equilibrium. The low CO[.sup]2[/] concentration 
in the atmosphere is sustained due to the functioning of the 
oceanic biota. It forms the vertical gradient of the 
CO[.sup]2[/] concentration and decreases the near-surface 
(and consequently atmosphere) CO[.sup]2[/] concentrations in 
the ocean by approximately a factor of 3 in comparison with that 
at greater debts. Should biota be destructed in the upper layer 
of the ocean, the CO[.sup]2[/] concentration in the 
atmosphere would have increased by about a factor of 3. This is 
a spectacular example of revealing the role of the biota in the 
control of environmental conditions. 
  Thus, the existing body of knowledge tells us, that by using 
solar radiation as an energy source, the biota sustains the 
environment under the conditions optimal for life by 
compensating occasional fluctuations, external geophysical 
perturbation and non-biological changes in the environment. 
  The concept of the biological controlled environmental 
sustainability is in conflict with the fundamental concept of 
Biology that is the ability of species to adapt themselves to 
any environmental changes caused by geophysical factors. The 
adaptation means a change in the biota due to environmental 
impacts, whereas the impacts of biota on the environment are 
assumed to be accidental and not compensate geophysical changes. 
Therefore, environmental conditions are optimal for the biota 
adapted to such conditions, and there are no other specific 
conditions that would be optimal for the biota. Finally, the 
continuous adaptation of biota to environmental changes 
determines its evolution, in the course of which a programme for 
the adaptation of every species in optimized. Only the best 
adapted species survive, and useful genetic information consists 
in the adaptation to the environment. 
  This concept contains a number of contradictions: 1) if 
environmental changes are determined by geophysical processes, 
it is not clear why these changes had not ever surpassed the 
thresholds where life is not possible; 2) if adaptation follows 
continually the changing environmental conditions, it is not 
clear why there are no transient forms between any two species 
either in space, i.e., among species existing simultaneously, or 
in time, i.e., according to the paleontological data. It is 
known, however, that species preserve morphological constancy 
and strict discretion. 
  To remove these contradictions, it is necessary to alter the 
earlier paradigm and assume that, although the information on 
the adaptation of species to environmental changes is necessary, 
much more important is the information on the functioning of 
species (feeding, behaviour, population density, etc.) which is 
required to stabilize the environment and is carried out by 
species within a specific community. This viewpoint provides a 
consistent explanation of biologically controlled environmental 
sustainability, which removes the first contradiction of the 
earlier paradigm. 
  The ideas proposed do not deny evolution which, within the 
framework of a new paradigm, turns out to be a supplementary 
process, arising spontaneously in the existing information 
molecular structures of biota due to double-, treble-, and more 
simultaneous mutations. It creates a barrier which is difficult 
to overcome for the transition from an old to a new species. 
This explains the sustainability and the discrete nature of each 
species thus removing the second contradiction. A possible 
mechanism can be a horizontal transfer of the gemon fragments 
formed by single-cell procariots which alone can create 
combinations of double-, treble-, and more simultaneous 
mutations due to their abundance and high frequency of their 
generations. 
  Thus, a new concept of the environmental safety is proposed, 
which is based on the assumption that the environment is 
geophysically unstale and that it is the biota that is the 
stabilizing factor sustaining the rnvironment within the limits 
providing the conditions for life. This concept makes it 
possible to give answers to questions which remained unanswered 
within earlier concepts of the environmental safety. 
<H5>  Sustainability Limits </H5>
  It is obvious that the compensation of the perturbations of 
the biota and the environment, i.e., the accomplishment of the 
Le Chatelier principle, is only possible up to a certain 
threshold of perturbations. 
  The high accuracy of the balance between synthesis and 
decomposition in ecosystems is ensured by a great number of 
competitively interesting species or their parts (for example, 
plant roots or leaves, fungi and microbes in soil). In this 
case, the relative fluctuation is proportional to I/N, where N 
is a number of noncorrelated parts of the system. Ecosystem 
always comprise large animals whose number is subject to 
considerable variations, but nevertheless they do not contribute 
significantly to changes in the biogeochemical equilibrium, 
since it has been established empirically that their portion of 
consumption (their participation in the destruction of organic 
matter) does not exceed l%. 
  Analysis of the behaviour of the atmospheric carbon has 
revealed that prior to the past century the land biota followed 
the La Chatelier because it was perturbed only slightly by 
mankind. The biota had compensated man's impact on the 
biosphere. The problem of environmental conservation did not 
arise, and the biomass of the continental biota increased in 
response to the growth of the atmospheric carbon concentrations. 
  However, in the past century (possibly from the beginning of 
the XIXth century), the land biota ceased to absorb the excess 
of CO[.sup]2[/] from the atmosphere. On the contrary, biota 
started to emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, thus 
increasing, instead of decreasing, environmental pollution 
resulting from the industrial emission. Therefore, it is 
necessary to determine the threshold at which the Le Chatelier 
principle ceased to function. 
  In the preindustrial times, the area of man-exploited land 
was less than 5% of the entire land territory. The humans 
utilized there about 20% of the biotic production, i.e., 
the 
part of the biotic production consumed did not exceed one 
percent on a global scale. That was within the quota "allowed" 
for big vertebrates. Overgrazing of pastures by domestic animals 
is a convincing demonstration of the existence of such a 
threshold. 
  If local anthropogenic impacts exceed the sustainability 
threshold, local perturbations appear, and pollution gradually 
is accumulated in the environment, with the fluxes of it toward 
the adjacent areas. The area of environmental perturbation is 
determined by a certain characteristic radius of the zone, 
outside which the impact of pollutants on the biota is at the 
sustainability threshold for unperturbed biota. The pollution 
can be reduced at a local spot by using a closed technological 
cycle, or by increasing diffusion, or, finally, by removing the 
pollutants from the locality. Today the environmental management 
is based on permissible concentration limits or permissible 
emission limits. These limits are not related to the 
sustainability threshold and represent, strictly speaking, only 
the extent of social or public concern in environmental problems. 
  The zone where the sustainability threshold has been 
surpassed is extended as perturbation grows. The sustainable 
state of the global biosphere can exist until the unperturbed 
part of the biosphere is able to compensate all the man-made 
perturbation, i.e., until the sustainability threshold is 
exceeded on a global scale. The environmental changes observed 
at the present time definitely show that the sustainability 
threshold has indeed been exceeded on a global scale. The 
estimates available reveal that presently the human consumption 
of the primary biological production on the land amounts to 
40%, while various kinds of economic activity cover 63 
million 
km[.sup]2[/] of land. 
  As has been mentioned above, at the beginning of the 19th 
century, the terrestrial biota absorbed less carbon dioxide than 
it released to the atmosphere as a result of economic activity. 
The direction of the net carbon dioxidflx [as printed] changed. 
Since then, the biosphere has become an additional source of 
carbon dioxide, increasing its emission to the atmosphere in 
addition to industrial emissions. Besides almost 6 Gt of 
CO[.sup]2[/] released to the atmosphere from fossil fuel 
burning, a similar amount of CO[.sup]2[/] is emitted by 
degrading terrestrial biota. The ocean biota has so far been 
disturbed only slightly and therefore it absorbs G St of 
CO[.sup]2[/] annually, in accordance with the Le Chatelier 
principle. About 2 Gt of CO[.sup]2[/] is absorbed by the 
aquatic biota in inorganic form due to physicochemical 
processes, whereas approximately 4 GT of CO[.sup]2[/] is 
added annually to 700 Gt of carbon dioxide which is present in 
the atmosphere. These figures characterize the global carbon 
cycle. 
  A considerable man-made impact has been observed in the 
inland part of the global hydrological cycle. The global river 
runoff from the continents is equal to the water influx by the 
atmosphere from the oceans. In the absence of terrestrial biota, 
the amount of precipitation on the land should be determined 
mainly by the volume of water transported from the oceans and by 
the evaporation from inland water bodies because bare rocks 
would either suck water or let it run off. Biota with a high 
leaf area index drastically increases the return of water to the 
atmosphere due to transpiration, thus sustaining a closed water 
cycle and providing two-thirds of the precipitation on land. So 
biota is responsible for 70% of precipitation on land. In 
an 
unperturbed forest, up to 90% of solar energy is absorbed 
by 
the foliage surface and is used for transpiration, while less 
than 40% of solar radiation is absorbed by agroecosystems. 
Therefore, during the whole history of human race, the clearing 
and replacement of forestlands by pastures, cropland, 
settlements, roads, etc., could have reduced transpiration by 
almost one half. 
  For natural plant communities and agroecosystems over the 
USSR territory, a water-transfer index has been determined. It 
is a ratio between a variability of precipitation and a 
variability of total evaporation during the vegetation period. 
This ratio for forests and wetlands is 2.5-3.0, for meadows and 
steppes is 1.5-2.0 for agroecosystems in the area of Volga river 
and in the Northern Caucasus this ratio drops down to 0.8-1.1, 
i.e., the water control capacity of the agroecosystems is low. 
Over the whole period of human history, this ratio has been 
reduced on the average for land by a factor of 1.6. A result of 
perturbation of the land biota is desertification which went on 
during the entire period of human history. 
  In summary, one can conclude that the human activity 
including the consumption of energy, 90% of which is 
obtained 
from nonrenewable resources, has resulted in such a severe 
impact on the biosphere that the latter has lost its capability 
to sustain balanced biogemical [as printed] cycles within the 
necessary degree of accuracy. 
  The biosphere has lost its potential to restore the 
properties of environment and to sustain its optimal state 
required for the sustenance of life. The degrading biosphere has 
itself become a source of pollution and destabilization of the 
global environment. 
  We believe that the proposed concept of global environmental 
safety provides answers to fundamental problems which remained 
unsolved within the scopes of the previous concepts. 
<H5>  Perspectives for Survival </H5>
  As has been suggested above, one has every reason to believe 
that only the biosphere which consists of the biota and the 
environment interacting with it, is capable to sustain the 
environment, provided that external perturbations do not exceed 
a permissible threshold, that is the biosphere functions 
according to the Le Chatelier principle. That is why, the 
conservation of natural communities and the existing species in 
amounts reassuring the functioning of the le Chatelier principle 
with regard to perturbations is the basic condition for the 
continuation of life on the Earth and the survival of the human 
race. The modern civilization does not ensure this. It has also 
brought about a discrepancy between the genetic programme of a 
human being and his present ecological niche, which should lead 
to the degradation of the gemone of man. This last problem means 
an extreme importance of the population genetics. 
  Research efforts should be directed towards seeking for new 
data and obtaining more precise information in support of the 
concept of the biological control to sustain the environment. 
For this purpose, global monitoring of biological cycles should 
be improved (first of all, that of the carbon cycle); more 
reliable assessment of the biologic primary production should be 
made both on the global and regional scales; parts of the land 
and ocean which are subject to exceptionally strong 
anthropogenic impacts should be identified; carbon dioxide 
emissions by the land biota should be calculated on the basis of 
observations, and regions of the most intensive emissions should 
be singled out. To solve these and other problems, it is 
necessary to correct the relevant national and international 
research programmes. All systems of environmental monitoring and 
modelling should be reoriented with due attention to the 
priority aspects of the global environmental safety. 
  The first and foremost objective to be achieved is to reduce 
the man- made perturbations of the biosphere thus guaranteeing 
recovery of the adequate functioning of the Le Chatelier 
principle in the biosphere. One has stopped the expansion of 
economic activity on a global scale in order to save those 
biospheric regions which have not degraded due to civilization. 
They might become the sources for recovery of the entire 
biosphere, since the biota possesses a powerful mechanism of 
self-control. It is particularly essential to conserve forests 
and wetlands as the most productive systems of the biosphere. 
Among these communities, the tropical forests are of 
particularly vital importance because they are "concentrators" 
of the biodiversity, and their productivity exceeds that of the 
temperate forests by a factor of 4. It is also extremely 
important to make a thorough inventory of the preserved parts of 
the biosphere making use of all available observation means, 
including satellite remote sensing. Some regions should be 
singled out as particularly protected natural reserves. It is 
connection, of special interest are polar zones, high mountain 
areas and deserts. It would be very reasonable to begin with 
proclaiming the entire continent as a reserve. Among other major 
actions are the following: further transition to the 
resource-and- energy-saving technologies; creation of the waste 
treatment facilities to reduce the zones of pollution load on 
the biota due to local man- made effects. These, are the tasks 
for the transition period, and their accomplishment would lessen 
the antropogenic stress on the biosphere. 
  A perspective objective which would make it possible to 
solve 
the biosphere preservation problem radically, is the reduction 
of energy consumption by approximately a factor of 10. This 
would decrease the man-made perturbation of the terrestrial 
biota by an order of magnitude and enable it to restore 
completely its functioning on the basis of the Le Chatelier 
principle. 
  This process would be long enough to make possible the 
transition to a decrease of the global population by 
approximately a factor of 10. The latter problem is certainly 
the most painful because mental stereotypes formed in the past 
were based on the fear of depopulation and on the stimulation of 
high birth rates and formation of large families which was then 
so important to increase the competitiveness of a family, a 
tribe, a nation, a state. At present, the ethical principles 
favouring a refusal from the population control cannot ensure 
anymore the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of 
mankind. 
  A transition from the present two percent population growth 
rate to the equal population drop rate apparently would not 
bring economic problems. In the former case, the extent of the 
demographic stress is caused by children while in the latter the 
stress of an equal value is caused by elderly people, but the 
difference is that the latter requires less expenses. If 
depopulation takes place, it is necessary to ensure the 
preservation of ethnic minorities. Thus, it seems that from the 
economic, demographic, ecological and ethical points of view, 
the possibility of depopulation appears to the realistic. 
  A key point in forming environmental awareness, harmonic 
development of society and nature, elaboration of new ecological 
mentality would be provision of adequate environmental 
information for both the broad public, and experts. Since most 
people have been deprived of proper environmental education, the 
public opinion is often formed under the influence of mass 
media. Therefore, such mass media system must be developed that 
would ensure the transition to the environment-oriented 
mentality. This may prove to be a complicated task on the road 
of overcoming the global environmental crisis. 
<H5>  Part 2. Russia in Environmental Crisis </H5>
  In view of the discussion presented above, the environmental 
situation in Russia is an important topic to consider. Russia 
has a total area of 17 million sq.km and embraces a great 
variata of landscapes. Wilderness natural systems, however, are 
preserved mostly in Siberia, the Arctic regions and high 
mountain areas. 
  The population of Russia, according to the census of 1989 is 
147,386,000; of this total 108,419,000 live in town, 38,967,000 
in rural regions; 95,000,000 live in the European part, 
20,000,000 in the Ural region, the rest in Siberia and the Far 
East. The areas of these regions are 3470, 1865, 11740 thousand 
sq.km respectively. 
  A primary biologic production by net weight over the 
territory of Russia averages to 20 ton/ha annually, being about 
25 ton/ha in the European part, 20 ton/ha in the Ural region, 
nearly 15 ton/ha in Siberia and the Far East. 
  One person accounts for 11.6 ha or in terms of potential 
primary production-232 ton/year, only 2.32 ton/year (1%) 
of 
which can be consumed without any ecological consequences. An 
actual value of the primary production consumption can be 
estimated on the basis of land use balance. Land use includes: 
agricultural lands are 223 million ha; lands occupied by mine 
waste rock, waste dumps and mixed tailings are 15 million ha; 
lands used for towns, villages, roads, etc., are 3.5 million ha; 
lands subjected to yearly man-produced fires are 1 million ha. 
The primary production obtained from these lands is preempted 
practically completely by man. One person is accounted 1.6 ha of 
these lands. In addition, as a result of antropogenic impacts 
(acid rains, etc.) 62 million ha supply half as much of primary 
production which adds up 0.2 ha per capita. Thus, an average per 
capita consumption of the biologic primary production over the 
territory of Russia amounts to nearly 36 tons per person per 
year (without taking into account other kinds of consumption). 
It exceeds the limit set by the nature 16 times. This means that 
over the territory of Russia the biota does not follow the Le 
Chatelier principle, the ecosystems have lost their ability to 
be sustainable, the balance of nutrients has been disturbed and 
the biota itself has become a source of pollution because it has 
started emitting carbon dioxide. The ecological niches are being 
degraded, genomes of organisms are deformed, ecosystems are 
deteriorating. All these processes and many others, indicate 
that a severe ecological crisis has been occurring. 
  To this critical ecological background a great number of 
pollutance is added which are the final production of the 
non-renewable resources consumption. One person accounts for up 
to 53 tons of mineral resources mined per year. A part of this 
amount is exported, the rest is processed to obtain a final 
product. The processing technology requires 800 tons of water 
per capita per year mostly taken from surface sources. Taking 
into account an efficiency the yearly water consumption per 
capita amounts to 200 tons. The final product is accounted for 
about 2 tons per capita. All the rest 95 percent are waste 
products polluting the environment. As to the final product it 
may also be regarded as wastes, but delayed wastes. 
  Economic activity on the territory of Russia to a large 
extent is based on wet technologies resulting in a great amount 
of polluted water and much greater solid wastes. One hundred 
eighty four tons of polluted water per capita is discharged to 
water bodies. Water quality is controlled by measuring just few 
parameters which is insufficient to maintain the water quality 
standards. The actual water quality standards are inadequate. 
They consider an irrigation returned water as being of quality 
while in fact it is heavily polluted. In the estimation of a 
volume of polluted water many sources are not taken into account 
such as emergency discharges, river vessels pollution, 
inefficient operation of water treatment system, non-point 
source of pollution, dry and wet deposition from the atmosphere, 
run-off of pesticides and fertilizers, wash off from railways 
and highways, etc. 
  To maintain the water quality standards, 8-8 [as printed] 
thousand tons of clean water per capita per year would be 
required to dilute polluted water. This means that exception 
[of] a high water period the main rivers of Russia are polluted. 
Ground waters are polluted, particularly in the European part. 
There are about 1,000 polluted areas, 224 being very extended. 
  Soil contamination by pesticides is spreading out of 5,000 
samples taken over the territory of Russia during a year, traces 
of pesticides have been found in 25%; 1.5% 
contained the 
quantities exceeding the acceptable limit. Out of 5,000 samples 
of vegetation traces of pesticides were found in 17%; 
5% of 
samples contained the quantities exceeding the acceptable limit. 
The content of nitrates exceeds the limit in one-sixth of the 
vegetation samples. 
  There are 15 disposal grounds for radioactive wastes. The 
most spacious are situated in the Urals region. The total 
radioactivity of wastes buried in this area exceeds that 
resulted from the Chernobyl accident by at least one order of 
magnitude. As a result of the Chernobyl accident, a large part 
of European Russia, particularly Briansk, Tula, Orel and 
Belgorod regions have become polluted. 
  Low efficiency of resources use and obsolete technologies 
leading to great losses of resources are essential addition 
factors of the environment pollution. 
  During the mining process considerable amounts of mineral 
resources are not extracted and therefore lost. The 
corresponding figures for coal is 14%, chromium ore is 
29%, 
potassium chloride is 61%. Extraction of oil is no more 
than 
30-33%. Wastes from forest felling amounts to 40%. 
Wastes in 
agriculture have not been accounted, but by the existing 
estimations they are no less than 30%. On agricultural 
lands 
the gumus [as printed] losses amount to 0.64 ton/ha annually. 
  In Russia, about 100 cities have a very high level of air 
pollution. The situation with drinking water is also very 
serious. It contains heavy metals, pesticides, and their 
derivatives nitrates, etc. Drinking water quality measurements 
in some cities, St. Petersburg included, have shown even the 
traces of dioxine. 
  The consequences of these environmental disturbances, the 
loss of the biosphere ability for regeneration enormous amounts 
of pollutants have deteriorated the living and health conditions 
of population. For the last 20 years in Russia the mortality 
rate has increased by 25%. Mortality caused by 
cardiovascular 
diseases has increased from 381.2 to 551.9 per thousand of death 
cases; caused by malignant tumors, from 130.6 to 182.5, cancer 
diseases becoming "youger." [as printed] Increase in genetic 
degradation has been observed. Every tenth person inherits such 
diseases as a therosclerosis, ischemic diseases, diabetes, etc. 
In cities with disturbed ecological situation functional 
disorders in blood forming organs, intracellularenzime and 
immune systems are observed. In rural areas with a high level of 
pesticide use (over 10 kg) of active substance per hectare per 
year, the deterioration of the immune system in human organism 
as well as respiratory diseases are observed. Children suffer 
from anomalies in cardiovascular system, mental disorders, iron 
deficiency anemia, etc. Correct methods for accounting the 
losses resulted from the environmental disturbance and damage do 
not exist. The estimations for Russia show that the losses 
amount to 10-12% of the total national product annually, 
while 
the budget allocated for the solution of environmental problems 
is about 1%. In 1989 the allocation for the environmental 
protection and the provision of adequate ecological conditions 
for the population amounted to 7.5 billion roubles or only 50 
roubles per capita. One quarter of this sum was capital 
investments while three-fourths were spent for operational 
management including salary payments to government officials. 
About 0.4 billion has not been used at all. The plan for putting 
in operation environment control facilities was fulfilled in the 
area of water management by 43% and for pir by 
53%. [as 
published] 
  An analysis of existing air and water treatment 
installations 
has shown that the waste water purification systems are 
inefficient. Dust collecting and air purification systems have 
become physically and morally obsolete. The conclusion is quite 
definite: the funds allocated for environmental problems are not 
enough and even they have been used ineffectively. It is proved 
by statistical data on extremely high level of pollution over 
the territory of Russia. Basing on regular publications about 
such cases in the newspaper GREEN WORLD one can conclude that 
over 100 cases of high level air pollution are recorded every 
month and not less than 100 cases are also for water bodies. In 
about 10 percent of these cases the level of pollution is 
extremely high. 
  This very brief analysis of the ecological situation in 
Russia leads to the following conclusion. Over a greater part of 
the Russian Federation territory the consumption of primary 
biological production by man is 10-40 times more than "allowed" 
quota. As a result, the environment is degrading, the biota has 
become a source of pollutants emission instead of being their 
sink. The emission of carbon dioxide CO[.sup]2[/] and methane 
has increased. Vast territories are desertified. A great number 
of river basins have been polluted, water flows have lost their 
self-purification ability. Soil fertility is decreasing. Food 
quality is deteriorating. All these factors make the living 
conditions and the health of people ever worse. Thus, it is 
evident that there is a severe environmental crisis and a human 
ecology crisis in Russia. 
  The main cause of the crisis is the excessively high level 
of 
consumption of primary biological production and of 
non-renewable resources. Low efficiency puts, however, low 
actual level of food production and consumption, as well as a 
low level of consumer goods consumption. It results from the 
following factors: on the one hand, it is an overall 
inefficiency of the economy due to its militarization; the use 
of resources-depletion technologies; the export consisting 
mainly of raw materials; enormous losses and wastes of all 
stages of raw materials because of out-dated and ineffective 
technologies. On the other hand, there is no policy to control 
the demographic processes. The family planning is nonexistent 
still the stereotype calling for the growth of population and a 
large is widespread, though it has been evident that the 
population growth and large families do not provide a stable 
development of a country, society and family. [sentence as 
published] 
  In the area of science the environmental crisis in Russia 
calls for the revision of the objectives and concept of the 
future monitoring system, for the change in the approach to 
ecological modelling, as well as in the research of the 
biosphere-geosphere system, for the development of environmental 
management for particular areas and regions and for 
environmental cartography. 
  A fundamental solution of the crisis can be only by means of 
reduction of human consumption of primary biological production 
down to the level providing a biochemically balanced biosphere 
obeying the Le Chatelier principle (1.5). In the process of 
addressing this basic strategic objective the problems of human 
ecology should be solved by revising the objectives, structure 
and efficiency of the present economy. It should be a different 
kind of economy to be based on the use of energy-and-resource 
saving technologies. A proper infrastructure must be created as 
a foundation for the solution of the environmental crisis. 
Therefore, any environmental programme for Russia must be 
preceded by the programme oriented specifically towards the 
creation of infrastructure containing legislative, economic, 
monitoring, information, education, social international 
cooperation and technological components. 
<H5>  Conclusion, A Look Into the XXI Century </H5>
  Analysis of the state of the environment in the world 
reflected in many publications of the last years (in 
Russian...1984; in Russian, 1989; Our...1987; State..., 1989, 
1990; World..., 1988-89, 1990-91; Climate..., 1990; Climate 
in..., 1990; Environmentally..., 1991; Caring..., 1991) 
undoubtedly demonstrates that the main trends in environmental 
destabilization keep on growing. National and international 
environmental programmes, national laws and international 
conventions, implementation of more effective resource- and 
energy-saving technologies, multibillion dollar investments into 
the waste treatment facilities, and many other attempts have not 
been able to revert the trends or considerably slow them down at 
global level, though some problems of the environmental cleaning 
have been successfully solved at the local and national levels. 
  Many profound disturbances of the environment have emerged 
as 
a result of nature's unwarranted widening of the ecological 
niche reserved for Homo sapiens. They cannot be corrected by 
engineering or technological means. In many cases, particularly 
in Russia, environmental problems are considered in the light of 
pollution or its consequences which are in fact a tip of the 
iceberg or else, a derivative from the main causes of the 
current ecological crisis. High expectations are held in 
transferring environmentally benign technologies to the 
developing countries. However, if the technology transfer is 
successful and held on a cardinal recovery of the Earth's 
life-supporting system would not occur. 
  Even greater, perhaps, the main expectations are connected 
with a sharp increase in funding for global environmental 
problems if governments and the private sector would at last 
become aware where their real priorities should be. Indeed, a 
sharp increase in financing of the environmental programmes and 
the creation of special international funds are necessary. But 
even if funding for the restoration of the biosphere increased 
by one or two orders of magnitude, the growing population of the 
world would keep on destroying it. One has to accept that money 
in this area does not solve everything. 
  Expectations are also held in solving the environmental 
problems with the strong, presently non-existing integration of 
economy and ecology in agricultural and industrial production. 
Indeed, this is very important for the present stage of the 
history of mankind since it would ease the load on the biosphere 
thus slowing down the development of the crisis. However, the 
world development in the XXth century is still considered in 
terms of the production growth though for a very large part of 
mankind the benefits of the technological revolution are 
inaccessible and the number of such people in increasing. 
Besides, one has to remember that growth and development are not 
only two different words but also two different concepts, and 
economic and social development are not necessarily accompanied 
by the growth of production. If we look into the environmental 
consequences of world development in this century that is into 
the implications of the growth of production we would see that 
it was a way to the catastrophe. It is very clearly seen on the 
territory of Russia but one can also sense an abyss behind an 
environmental prosperity seen on a surface in some other 
countries. 
  In the middle of 1980s symptoms of another catastrophe 
connected with the global environmental crisis have appeared. 
The per capita amount of the world grain production, as well as 
the arable and irrigated areas have begun to decline while the 
price of grain is going up. It is particularly true for Africa 
where hunger has become a constant factor but the population is 
increasing. It is an unstable continent by many parameters and 
it confirms the point that population growth is a destabilizing 
factor at all levels from continents to families. 
  More frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases, widening of 
the areals of epidemics, spreading of the AIDS cases are the 
signs of the environmental crisis and of the deterioration of 
the standard of living. Morbidity rate due to environmental 
conditions is increasing, as is the number of cases of genetic 
diseases indicating a decay of the human genome. 
  Once again, all these facts indicate a progressive 
development of the environmental crisis and the question of the 
very existence of man as a biological species. When entering the 
XXI century mankind should either accept the challenge or in 
fact give up the struggle by not solving the main problem of the 
biosphere restoration. 
  All the authoritative international documents on the 
ecological future of the mankind which appeared during the last 
few years (State..., 1990; Our..., 1987; Caring..., 1991; and 
others) agree that man's existence is not possible without 
preserving natural communities of organisms, that the biosphere 
has certain limits for an economic intervention, that it is 
necessary to stop the population growth on the planet. However, 
behind these statements there are unanswered questions. But 
without the answers the suggested strategy called a sustainable 
development cannot but call the questions, particularly if under 
the term of a sustainable development one means improvement of 
"the quality of human life while living within the carrying 
capacity of supporting ecosystems" (Caring..., 1991, p.10). 
  The main questions which are necessary to answer before any 
strategy can be elaborated are as follows: 
  If one accepts that the survival and sustainable development 
of mankind is impossible without preserving natural communities 
of organisms (ecosystems, landscapes, etc.), then it is 
necessary to understand the functioning mechanisms which ensure 
the life on the Earth, including the life of humans. 
  If it is accepted that the biosphere has a limited carrying 
capacity, then it is necessary to determine the limits of the 
capacity. 
  If the above questions are answered, then one has to define 
whether mankind is within the caring capacity or already outside 
it and if so, when the threshold has been crossed. 
  The strategies for the future of mankind would depend on the 
answers to the above questions. 
  This book has made an attempt to answer these questions. To 
define the strategy for the XXI century, most important is the 
conclusions that mankind in its development has already some 
time ago exceeded the carrying capacity of the biosphere. 
Natural communities are being destroyed and under these 
conditions social development cannot be sustainable. 
  Having exceeded the limit of consumption "permitted" by 
nature by one order of magnitude mankind has disturbed the 
stability of the biosphere. This led to the deformation of the 
environment the sustainability of which cannot be maintained by 
the deteriorating biota. That is why one has to raise the 
problem of mankind's survival as its main goal for the long term 
historical perspective. The sustainable development strategy can 
be accepted for the present transitional stage. 
  The problem of human survival is connected to the need to 
decrease energy consumption by one order of magnitude and, 
therefore, with the corresponding reduction of the number of 
people living on the Earth. The objective is not in slowing down 
the increment and not in the stabilization of population in the 
future but in its considerable diminution as compared with the 
current number. We talk about a very peaceful, well accepted and 
understood process as opposed to the chaos and suffering of very 
many people which are inevitable while passively expecting the 
stabilization at the level of 10-12 billion. 
  The goal of considerable reduction of the world population 
as 
compared with its present rapid growth is incredibly complex to 
achieve and very difficult to comprehend. However, either 
mankind must find the strength to solve the problem or else the 
Nature deteriorating thanks to man would get rid of the species 
of Homo sapiens which plays the role of a geological force and 
has introduced such disturbance into the biosphere that no other 
species has ever introduced during the whole history of life on 
the planet. 
  Demographic processes are characteristic of inertia, and the 
population of eight billion in the world unfortunately is 
practically inevitable. But if to begin to act now the 
subsequent stabilization would come followed by the reduction in 
population. No one country alone is able to solve the problem, 
neither continent nor region. The problem is unprecedented by 
its complexity and requires a level of an international 
understanding and cooperation unknown before. The people of the 
Earth including the most poor and uneducated should become aware 
of the need to make the transition to a one child family. One 
can either say that it is impossible to fulfil and go on towards 
the end of mankind or to make a very strong, unprecedented 
effort to renounce the stereotypes and to start going along in 
the interests of the whole of mankind. 
  The ideas and considerations suggested in this book 
definitely require further development, elaboration and 
discussion. Their acceptance or denial on the basis of 
scientific arguments may considerably influence on the strategy 
of development of the world and Russia in the XXI century.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1, RIA -- The allegations that 
Russia has already turned into a site for deploying harmful 
industrial waste from Western countries have no grounds and are 
misinformation, runs today's statement of the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection. 
  The statement followed a report, "Russia: dust heap of 
Western waste", which was issued by the Greenpeace organization 
late in 1993. The report impelled some media to similar 
publications. 
  According to the report, 96 attempts have been made in the 
last six years to supply to Russia 34 million tons of waste. 
The statement notes that the cited data testifies only to 
intentions and is not an accomplished fact really threatening 
Russia's ecological security. According to the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection, local environmental protection 
bodies have rejected the overwhelming majority of Western 
proposals following expert conclusions.

  [Text] Moscow, February 22, RIA -- An agreement banning the 
dumping of radioactive and industrial waste in the seas came 
into force on February 21, 1994. It was signed by 70 countries. 
  Russia has, however, officially announced it is not going to 
join this agreement. 
  Sada Aksartova, a spokeswoman for the international 
ecological organisation Greenpeace, in commenting on the Russian 
Federation's stand, told a RIA correspondent it was a great 
mistake on the part of the Russian Government, and will evoke a 
highly negative response from the other countries. 
  Among the major powers, according to Aksartova, only 
Australia, in addition to Russia, has refused to accede to the 
agreement, "taking time-out" for two years.

<F P=106> [Report by environment correspondent Bronwen Maddox: </F>
"Rebuke From EU on Water Estimate"] 
  [Text] The UK has overestimated the costs of complying 
with water quality directives, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the 
union's environment commissioner, said in London yesterday. 
  UK water companies have predicted that they will need to 
invest more than 10bn pounds to bring water and sewage treatment 
standards in line with the EU [European Union] urban waste water 
directive. But Mr Paleokrassas, whose officials met UK water 
regulators Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority this week, 
said the eventual costs were likely to be "several billion 
pounds" lower. 
  His comments came after months of rising tension between 
London and Brussels over water standards. The UK has attacked 
some standards as unnecessarily high, and asked for more time to 
comply. Yesterday Mr Paleokrassas said: "There will be no 
lowering of standards or lengthening of dates." 
  Thames Water said: "A lot of investment follows from this 
directive, but the costings are complex and the interpretation 
needs to be clarified further." 
  Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Paleokrassas 
also said the European Commission would say within two weeks 
whether the UK government's decision to licence the Thorp 
nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield followed commission 
rules. 
  "There is some doubt as to whether the environmental impact 
assessment has been infringed," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Parliament Wants Community </F>
To Give Impetus To Follow-up on Earth Summit"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] The World Environment Fund, the result of a 
Franco-German initiative which was launched as a three-year 
experimental phase by the World Bank, must be reformed if it is 
to run efficiently, and must favor projects of a local scope in 
order to allow sustainable endogenous development respecting 
biodiversity. This is what the Parliament [EP] called for when 
it adopted the report by French Liberal Jean-Thomas Nordmann, 
who underlines in particular the importance of the European 
Union's participation in the Fund, a participation that should 
facilitate the coordinating role in the world environmental 
problems facing the Union. 
  Finally, the EP wants the mention "token entry" which is 
currently indicated in the Community budget for the financing of 
the Fund to be replaced in future by appropriate amounts. The 
EP fears that the existence of the Fund itself is in jeopardy 
after the expiry in June 1994 of the temporary period of its 
operating. The EP has also adopted the report by Spanish 
Liberal Gudalupe Ruiz-Gimenez Aguilar on the follow-up by the 
European Union [EU] of the implementation of "Agenda 21" adopted 
at the Earth Summit in Rio, requesting in particular that the 
Commission and member states add to the ECU3 billion promised in 
Rio additional resources intended for the implementation of 
"Agenda 21." The Commission is also invited to include in all 
international trade agreements a clause on the protection of 
natural resources, and to propose to the Council a Green Paper 
on trade and the environment. As for member states, they must, 
according to the Parliament, establish in 1994 committees and 
national plans for sustainable development accompanied by 
mechanisms inherent in the formulation of indicators of 
sustainable development. During the common debate on the two 
reports, Mr. Nordmann, underlining the Environmental Fund's 
operating problems, invited the Community to play its 
coordinating role fully whereas according to him the World Bank 
should be limited to a role of technical support for projects. 
Mrs. Ruiz-Gimenez Aguilar insisted in particular on the 
implementation of conventions on biodiversity and the climatic 
change and underscored the need to have additional financial 
means to implement the "calendar 21" adopted at the Earth 
Summit. The European Union must abide by the commitments 
entered into at Rio, the MEP said. 
  European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro shared the view 
of the MEPs about the need to provide renewed impetus to the 
implementation of the Rio decisions and believed that the 5th 
program on environmental matters constituted a strategic 
framework that should enable bolstering the Union's action in 
this area.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment - Six Member States Set </F>
up Cogen Europe (Association for promotion of cogeneration 
technology (CHP) throughout Europe)"; as released by Brussels 
Textline database] 
  [Text] The Cogen Europe association has been set up to 
promote the implementation throughout Europe of cogeneration 
schemes, a technology of certain ecological interest and 
allowing major savings of primary energy, which is also known as 
CHP (combined heat and power). It was launched this month with 
the support of six member states (UK, Netherlands, Spain, 
Germany, France and Greece) and with the financial aid of the 
Energy Directorate of the European Commission. Its first 
chairman is Ton van der Does, director of the Dutch CHP office. 
Cogen Europe, with its main office in London, will have the 
task of: 
  (a) identifying the regulatory and institutional barriers to 
cogeneration development in Europe and acting to reduce them at 
the policy level; 
  (b) collaborating on relevant issues with other key European 
energy associations and industries; 
  (c) quantifying the potential for cogeneration in Europe. 
  Speaking at the launch, Mr. van der Does said that the 
association will work toward better cooperation between key 
actors in the European energy scene in order to "establish a 
clear and positive policy framework for cogeneration." "The 
Brussels institutions now have a professional and focused 
organization with which they can work to resolve the many 
challenges facing cogeneration in the 1990s," he continued. The 
creation of this association, he feels, reflects the absence of 
clear recognition by EU and many national policy makers of the 
significant benefits of cogeneration schemes, whether 
industrial, small-scale or city- wide. While conventional power 
generation is often only 35 percent efficient (up to 65 percent 
of the energy potential being released as waste heat), 
cogeneration technology stops this by using the heat for 
industry, commerce and home heating. Cogeneration therefore 
increases the overall efficiency of energy use - up to 85 
percent and beyond - giving primary energy savings of about one 
third.

<F P=106> [Judy Dempsey report: "Brown Coal With Green Appeal"] </F>
  [Text] Years of research are finally paying off for the 
Mining Academy of Freiberg, in the east German state of Saxony: 
its Institute for Agglomeration and Air Pollution is scheduled 
to mass-produce an environmentally friendly brown coal briquette. 
  Not all east Germans can take the invention seriously. 
"You're telling me that a 'green' lignite briquette exists?" 
says Jochen Hoefer, a former miner. "I know all about the 
lignite. The dirty, dusty air. We inhaled the stuff for more 
than 40 years, and we burned the stuff in our homes." 
  Wolfgang Naundorf, head of the institute, is not surprised 
by 
such descriptions: "Precisely because lignite is so dusty and 
contains such a high level of sulphuric acid, we began research 
on inventing the green briquette during the 1980s because we 
wanted to have clean air." 
  At first, the experiments were haphazard. This was largely 
because the former communist authorities in east Germany had no 
inclination to fund research that might slow down production of 
brown coal. Until unification, brown coal accounted for more 
than 85 per cent of primary energy consumption in the five east 
states. 
  "We got no financing or support for our research. We did it 
as a purely academic exercise," says Naundorf. Despite the lack 
of resources and modern equipmeht, the institute persevered. 
  Ralph Wallenberg, one of the scientists involved in the 
research, explains how, after many attempts, they found the 
successful formula. They added 3.5 grams [g] of calcium hydrate 
(a combination of lime, chalk and gypsum) to every 100g of raw 
lignite. The calcium hydrate was mixed with the lignite as a 
suspension in water. 
  The added calcium compounds reduced sulphuric acid emissions 
when the briquettes were burnt but had the disadvantage of 
weakening their structure. The researchers hardened the 
briquettes again by adding some pulverised hard-coal coke, or 
anthracite. 
  "The sulphuric acid emissions have been reduced from 3 per 
cent to 0.5 per cent and the calorific, or heating content, has 
been increased by between 5 and 10 per cent," says Wallenberg. 
  The institute could not have continued its research had it 
not received a contract last year from the giant Mitteldeutsche 
Braunkohle (Mibrag) lignite fields, which straddle the states of 
Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, and which were being sold to an Anglo- 
American consortium led by Britain's Power-Gen and NRG of the 
US. "After much discussion, the consortium, although pretty 
sceptical about their value, decided to keep two of Mibrag's 
briquette- producing factories open," says Johann Neudert, head 
of one of Mibrag's engineering departments. 
  Naundorf says: "We had to work fast. On a dry coal basis, 
Mibrag has one of the highest sulphuric acid contents in 
Germany. It is between 2.5 and 4 per cent. Under European Union 
regulations, any solid fuels burned in small-scale outlets, for 
instance for domestic heating, must be reduced to 1 per cent by 
January 1995, otherwise they must be closed down." The contract 
enabled the institute to complete its research successfully. 
  The institute's staff know that one contract will not secure 
their future. At present, the state of Saxony provides a third 
of the institute's costs. The remaining two-thirds has to be 
raised by the staff even though they have had no previous 
experience of seeking research grants. Naundorf's small 
research department has been reduced by 10 to 16 members. 
  The need to secure more contracts to raise financing is even 
more critical because the academy is faced with probably the 
most serious crisis since its foundation in 1765: the collapse 
of manufacturing, and the shortage of students. 
  The closure of large heavy industry enterprises that used 
brown coal has been followed by the rapid run-down of the 
region's mining sector. Since 1990, more than 100,000 mining 
jobs have been lost and primary consumption of brown coal has 
plummeted from 91 million tonnes in 1989 to less than 51 million 
tonnes in 1993. The academy depended on the mining industry for 
its livelihood and very existence. Since the 18th century, it 
has trained generations of geologists and mining engineers, 
natural scientists and chemists. 
  "But now, we can hardly get enough students to fill the 
courses. The industry has few jobs," says Naundorf. Both the 
institute, set up in 1924 to conduct research into the 
properties of lignite, and the academy are finding it hard to 
pay staff. Morale is not high. 
  Wallenberg says one of the main drawbacks is equipment. "We 
cannot buy new equipment unless we win contracts. And if we 
don't win contracts, we can't refine our experiments to win 
contracts or pay our salaries." 
  Equipment notwithstanding, outsiders say they are struck by 
the academy's innovative standards. "The east German institutes 
do not have the state-of-the-art when it comes to equipment, but 
the people in Freiberg and, in my experience, east German 
scientists in general have the knowledge," says Michael Gillen, 
a mechanical engineer at the research department at Bord na 
Mona, Ireland's largest peat and turf company. 
  "They have all this brainpower which previously they could 
not use to its full potential. They compensated for the 
shortage of spare parts or new equipment by becoming highly 
creative and innovative," he added. 
  Bord na Mona recently contracted the institute to increase 
the durability and water resistance of the Irish peat briquette. 
"We might as well tap into the huge fund of knowledge," says 
Gillen. Selling that knowledge might secure Freiberg's furure.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Gasparetti: "The Electronic Owl That </F>
Watches Over the Environment"] 
  [Text] Thousands of bright colored dots on the computer 
screen reconstruct the images of animals: A wolf moving with 
suspicion, a group of deer in search of drinking water, a family 
of wild boars, father, mother and three little ones coming out 
from behind a bush. It is the middle of the night in the wood, 
but a strange electronic creature is spying on the secrets of 
nature. At first sight it resembles a camera mounted on a 
tripod, but there is something special inside those lenses and 
printed circuits. In the absence of light an infrared eye 
records details that not even the most sophisticated lens would 
be able to see during the day. Officine Galileo of Florence 
have jokingly renamed the nocturnal vision system an "electronic 
owl." Why is it different from all the others? Because the 
"electronic owl" does not act on reflected light as usually 
happens, but succeeds in capturing the radiation emitted by the 
subject. 
  The glass lens has been replaced by an opaque germanium disk 
that helps in capturing wavelengths that are not visible to 
normal cameras. The images are then processed by a workstation, 
which reproduces the outline of the animals, their most secret 
habits, their movements, and their numbers on the monitor. This 
technology is also used in the military sector. Officine 
Galileo has applied it to firing and sighting systems used 
during the Gulf War. Above all, the system developed by the 
Tuscany-based company, does not annoy "the animals of the 
night." In fact, the animals are not aware of the presence of 
the electronic intruder and therefore their reactions are 
recorded without any outside interference. The "infrared owl" 
is just the first in a series of projects developed as a result 
of the reconversion of Officine Galileo's military sector 
production which accounted for 80 percent of its total 
production up to 1978. A system that combines a mix of 
leading-edge technologies, electronics, and computer science has 
been developed to safeguard against forest fires. Special 
cameras installed in various parts of the forest and connected 
to a computerized center, provide precious round-the-clock 
information on the area and sound the alarm in case of fire. 
  The civil sector technology has another winning card: the 
multiple use of systems. For example, the fire watchdogs can 
also be used to transmit information of the state of health of 
vegetation and on pollution levels. Today, the majority of 
Officine Galileo's production is dedicated to civil systems 
(approximately 60 percent) and primarily for environmental 
protection. A bet that Officine Deputy Director Bruno Minguzzi 
comments on with a little bitterness: "There is still little 
awareness in connection with environmental protection and 
conservation. Programs are either not being launched or proceed 
very slowly."

<F P=106> [Article by Jacopo Giliberto: "The Lower House Says Yes to </F>
the Environmental Agency"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome. Environmental policy will have an 
"operational branch," a single body dealing with ecological 
monitoring, technical standards, data collection, and the 
promotion of research into pollution. It is the National 
Environmental Agency (ANPA), the establishment of which the 
lower house approved yesterday morning with 284 votes in favor, 
24 against, and 11 abstentions just before the motion of 
confidence in the government. ANPA will perform controls in 
companies and in all environmentally hazardous situations and 
will also submit proposals and advice to central and local 
government concerning the accepted levels for pollutants, 
standards for the quality of the air and water,and waste 
treatment. 
  The document approved by the lower house is identical to 
that 
approved by the senate last December and transforms a previous 
-- but very different -- government decree into law. Its 
creation was "long-winded and difficult" commented the former 
Green and later PSI [Italian Socialist Party] representative 
Rosa Filippini, who was also one of the most fervid supporters 
of the new organism. But the crucial moment for its creation 
was the 18 April referendum that removed the responsibility for 
health controls from the local health units. The first decree 
is dated 1 August and gives the go-ahead on the bureaucratic 
procedure during which the document was reviewed three times and 
underwent considerable modifications. 
  From the structural point of view, the initial proposals -- 
based on overseas experience -- provided for a "light" central 
organism (no more than 2-300 employees) with a widespread 
presence at local level or vice versa a ``heavy" central 
structure with a barely noticeable local structure. A 
compromise was decided upon: Provincial and regional authorities 
will be required to establish their own territorial facilities 
to work side by side with a large- scale national agency. The 
"heart" will be ENEA's [National Agency for New Technologies, 
Energy, and the Environment] DISP (with a staff of about 300), 
which represents the former and now under utilized nuclear 
program control body; an additional 150 people from other ENEA 
departments; staff from other organisms such as the Higher 
Institute of Health; ISPESL (Safety in the Workplace); the CNR 
[National Research Council], and from some ministries (primarily 
the environment ministry). The ANPA management will be composed 
of three directors appointed by the environment minister (with a 
three-year term in office) who will nominate the president. The 
director general will be appointed by the prime minister, but on 
the basis of proposals made by the environment minister. 
[passage omitted] 
  In particular, the recently-approved law creates new 
controls 
that will supplement existing ones (which the law did not 
abrogate). Here are some examples. ANPA will have jurisdiction 
over regulations concerning industrial waste, as will the CNR 
and the Higher Institute of Health; work safety, together with 
the labor ministry; polluting emissions, which also remain the 
jurisdiction of the Higher Institute of Health; the issuance of 
the "green" European label (Ecolabel) and ecoauditing, for which 
there are no specific organisms. It does not amend the 
jurisdiction set for the CNR, the national department of 
technical services (which falls under the prime minister), and 
ENEA (which comes under the industry ministry). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>
  [Text] Rome, (ANSA) 17 Jan -- ENEA [National Agency for 
New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] and the Ministry 
for Universities and Scientific Research have signed an 
agreement for a program, with funding of over 40 billion lire 
(to be precise 42) over three years, for research covering the 
entire environmental field. One of the four chapters of the 
document is dedicated to the environment (the other three deal 
with new technologies, Italian participation in the European 
fusion program, and the development of the technical-scientific 
support services at the ministry). According to the signatories 
to the agreement, it will constitute a fundamental instrument 
for the reinforcement of collaboration between the two bodies, 
directing resources to the realization of projects with precise 
goals. For the three years 1992/1995 the total resources amount 
to 400 billion lire. 
  There are plans for the diffusion of advanced technologies 
relating to the environment and for participation in 
wide-ranging initiatives that already are in existence, such as 
the national plan for environmental research and the Community's 
EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] program. Some 
sectors of intervention have however already been singled out. 
In fact models showing climatic changes will be prepared. This 
is a subject in which Italy is historically behind, and 
technologies will be developed to reduce impacts on the 
environment and manage the various types of monitoring. The 
research will mainly concern the Mediterranean Sea, natural 
risks to the environment (earthquakes, soil erosion), water 
resources and radioprotection.

<F P=106> [Article by Vivek Chaudhary: "N-Base Left Out of Green Plan"] </F>
  [Text] British green groups are unhappy at the omission of 
a British territory in the Indian Ocean, which also contains a 
vital US nuclear base, from a government conservation plan. 
  The British Indian Ocean Territory considered to be of 
"outstanding international conservation importance," includes 
the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only US 
nuclear base in the Indian Ocean. It failed to appear in the 
Government's action plan on biodiversity last week, despite 
featuring in a draft version. 
  The territory lies just south of the equator approximately 
2,000 miles off the coast of Kenya. It was bought by Britain 
from Mauritius for &pound;3 million in 1965, depopulated and 
given 
to the Americans for 50 years for defence purposes. 
  A Royal Navy detachment is also based there and Diego Garcia 
was the refuelling point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq 
during the Gulf war. 
  The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's 
largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds 
and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs. 
  Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the 
Environment and the Foreign Office asking why no references to 
the territory appeared in the UK Action Plan on Biodiversity, 
issued last week as a result of UK pledges at the Earth Summit 
in Rio in 1992. 
  A draft of the plan says: "For protection in the longer term 
a comprehensive conservation policy, based on a more detailed 
biodiversity inventory, is required." 
  Tony Juniper, of Friends of the Earth said: "The territory 
is 
probably one of Britain's most important assets. Its omission 
from the final plan is very mysterious. The territory deserves 
official recognition followed by rigorous protection." 
  He added: "The Diego Garcia base obviously has some role 
that 
is incompatible with nature conservation. But there is 
restricted access and we don't know the truth about what's going 
on there." 
  A DoE spokeswoman said considering the area's "unique 
circumstances," it would not be included. "Nevertheless we take 
our responsibility very seriously and legislative measures have 
been implemented to protect the islands ecological system."

<F P=106> [Report by Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent: "BNFL </F>
'Jumping Gun' on Thorp Reprocessing"] 
  [Text] British Nuclear Fuels is prepared to go ahead with 
significant contamination of its Thorp nuclear reprocessing 
plant at Sellafield before a crucial High Court judgment on its 
operation. 
  A judicial review of the Government's permission for the 
plant to open, granted in December after a year's delay, is 
being carried out at the request of Greenpeace and Lancashire 
County Council by Mr Justice Potts, who will not deliver his 
judgment until March. 
  However, a spokesman for BNFL [British Nuclear Fuels 
Limited] 
said last night that it had told the court that it aimed to move 
on to the next stage of Thorp's operations, the fragmentation, 
or "shearing" of highly radioactive spent nuclear power station 
fuel rods, on 7 March. 
  As soon as it does this, Thorp will have passed the point of 
no return. From then on parts of the plant will be highly 
radioactive and expensive to decommission. The cost could run 
to hundreds of thousands of pounds. 
  According to BNFL, Mr Justice Potts "recognises the 
importance of the date", and has said that he hoped to give his 
judgment before 7 March. 
  Greenpeace, which is attempting a last-ditch legal battle to 
halt operations at Thorp, said yesterday it was considering 
whether to apply for a stay under which the court could stop 
BNFL going ahead. 
  The fuel the company wants to shear comes from a British AGR 
[Advanced Gas Reactor] nuclear power station at Heysham, 
Lancashire. BNFL claims it is losing 2 million pounds for every 
week that Thorp is delayed. If Mr Justice Potts found in 
Greenpeace's favour, it would delay the start of full-scale 
operations for months and raise the prospect of Thorp never 
opening. 
  Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council claim that John 
Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment, and Gillian 
Shephard, Minister of Agriculture, were wrong to grant BNFL 
authorisations for radioactive emissions from Thorp into the air 
and the Irish Sea without first holding a public inquiry. 
  Greenpeace said yesterday that BNFL was jumping the gun. 
"This shows utter contempt for the fears of 80,000 people who 
have expressed real concern about radioactive discharges... and 
who have stated a desire for a full and independent public 
inquiry.'' 
  "It is an act of desperation, a futile and forlorn gesture 
because they will only have to pay to clean it up when we win 
the case. This is also public money, so is a scandalous waste." 
  The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate said BNFL would need 
further consents from the safety watchdog before it could go 
ahead with the shearing, but it was possible it would gain these 
before 7 March. 
  Immediately prior to the judicial review, on 12 January, 
Greenpeace withdrew an application for a stay on BNFL moving 
ahead with Thorp's operations. This followed evidence from the 
company's lawyer that there would be no significant radioactive 
contamination of the plant for at least 30 days. But the court 
case has taken longer to complete than anticipated.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Health and Safety Executive: "New </F>
Controls On Export of Certain Dangerous Chemicals"] 
  [Text] New controls on the export from European Community 
(EC) countries of certain dangerous chemicals which are destined 
for non-EC countries come into effect tomorrow, 11 February 1994. 
  The chemicals concerned are Aldrin, Dieldrin, DDT, HCH 
(mixed 
isomers), Fluoroacetamide, and Dinoseb and its salts. The new 
controls take the form of a requirement to abide by decisions 
made by importing countries about the chemicals in the light of 
information about risks associated with their use. 
  This reflects international concern about the use of 
dangerous chemicals, mainly pesticides, in developing countries, 
which may not always have the necessary expertise or resources 
to use them safely. 
  The requirement, known as the "Prior Informed Consent" (PIC) 
procedure, allows importing countries to decide whether to 
accept or refuse the chemicals, or apply conditions to their 
import. 
  The controls have been introduced by means of an amendment 
to 
an EC Regulation (No. 2455/92). As EC Regulations enter directly 
into law in EC member countries, no UK domestic legislation is 
required to implement them or amendments to them. 
  EC Regulation 2455/92 implements United Nations guidelines 
recognised by over 120 countries on the export/import of 
dangerous chemicals. 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  1. EC Regulation 2455/92 came into effect on 29 November 
1992. It has three main requirements: 
  -- an export notification scheme, already in force; in the 
UK 
exporters must notify HSE [Department of Health and Safety] of 
exports of any of 24 chemicals or groups of chemicals 30 days in 
advance of the first shipment to a non-EC country; 
  -- the Prior Informed Consent scheme; this has just been 
activated since the six chemicals mentioned above are the first 
to be added to an Annex to the Regulation and become subject to 
the PIC requirement; 
  -- all chemical exports are to be packaged and labelled 
correctly as if they were being sent to another EC member 
country. 
  2. The Regulation applies to certain industrial chemicals 
and 
pesticides but not to shipments intended for research or 
analytical purposes, or when they are in the form of waste.

<F P=106> [Article by Tony Dawe: "A TIMES Investigation Into Pollution </F>
and the Health of a Nation: Millions Face Air of Despair"] 
  [Text] The threat to the nation's health from increasing 
air pollution has prompted charities, research scientists, 
doctors and MPs to launch a concerted campaign for tighter 
controls on air quality. 
  They estimate that 10 million Britons, almost one in five of 
the population, are at risk from polluted air, including the 
elderly, pregnant women, children under two and those with 
respiratory illnesses. Asthma is increasing at an alarming rate: 
there are three million recorded sufferers and it is estimated 
that one in seven children is affected. It is the only treatable 
chronic illness that is becoming more prevalent in the western 
world, and 2,000 Britons die from it every year. Four in five 
deaths are avoidable. 
  A total of 7 million working days are lost because of 
asthma, 
at an annual cost of &pound;400 million to commerce and 
industry,&pound;70 million in sickness benefit and almost 
&pound;500 
million to the NHS. 
  Research, much of it funded by charities, has yet to 
establish that air pollution is a primary cause of asthma but, 
as Professor Robert Davies, consultant physician and reader in 
respiratory medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, central 
London, told The Times: "The current position which 
would be agreed by most people is that episodes of air pollution 
are a trigger to asthma." 
  Government research has shown that 19 million Britons a year 
are exposed to air pollution levels in excess of international 
guidelines. 
<H5>  The pollutants include: </H5>
  --Carbon monoxide, which deprives the body of oxygen by 
reacting with haemoglobin, causing drowsiness and headaches, 
slowing thought and reflexes and increasing pressure on the 
heart. 
  --Nitrogen oxides, which increase susceptibility to viral 
illnesses, irritate lung tissue and increase the risk of 
bronchitis and pneumonia. 
  --Ozone, which aggravates asthma and bronchitis but also 
affects normally healthy adults, causing coughing, eye, nose and 
throat irritation and headaches. 
  Figures gathered by Friends of the Earth show that in 1992, 
ozone levels exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines on 
269 days at 21 monitoring sites. 
  These disturbing statistics have been gathered despite 
Britain's poor record in monitoring air pollution, with only 
seven sites designed in compliance with European directives to 
measure nitrogen dioxide, compared with 200 in Germany. 
  The call for better monitoring of air pollution is one of 
the 
main themes of the new campaign because it would show where 
tighter controls need to be applied and alert those most at risk 
to the danger areas. 
  There are also widespread demands for greater research into 
the causes of respiratory illnesses so that doctors can be 
better informed about how to treat them. Dr Martyn Partridge, 
chief medical adviser to the National Asthma Campaign, said: "As 
far as asthma is concerned, the obsession is with preventing 
attacks, but what is much more exciting is the possibility 
through genetic research of identifying children, even a foetus, 
at risk. We could then plan what to do to alter that child's 
environment to prevent the disease developing." 
  The newly formed all-party asthma group of MPs is also 
campaigning for a greater awareness in Government of the scale 
of the disease and for it to be included in the next progress 
report on the Health of the Nation initiative. 
  More far-reaching reforms are demanded by organisations such 
as the British Lung Foundation, Friends of the Earth and the 
National Asthma Campaign. They want a transport strategy that 
takes account of health issues and greater encouragement for 
people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.

<F P=106> [Article by Tony Dawe: "Polluted Cities Fail To Monitor </F>
Deadly Cocktail"] 
  [Text] Most of Britain's big towns and cities fail to 
monitor the air their citizens breathe and have no plans to do 
so, despite mounting concern at increased levels of pollution, a 
survey released today reveals. 
  They include Aberdeen, Dundee, Newport and several English 
industrial centres such as Bradford, Stoke and Wolverhampton. 
  The gaps in the monitoring of potentially dangerous 
pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide 
are disclosed in a study commissioned by The Times 
and carried out by Friends of the Earth. 
  The results underline the criticisms being expressed by many 
health and environmental groups at apparent lack of concern in 
local and national government at the risk to the nation's health 
posed by air pollution. 
  Dr Malcolm Green, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, 
said: "People are affected not just by one source of pollution 
but by a cocktail of pollutants. Studies are pointing towards 
the cocktail as the major culprit for the health problems 
associated with poor air quality." 
  Separate figures collated for the first time from the 
existing monitoring stations show hundreds of occasions in 1992 
when pollutants exceeded international guidelines. 
  The findings follow a survey of all local authorities by the 
National Society for Clean Air, which reported that air-quality 
guidelines are exceeded in more than 100 areas, yet 60 
authorities that measure pollutants do not know what are the 
guidelines. 
  Friends of the Earth checked the air-monitoring arrangements 
in 58 British towns and cities with populations of more than 
100,000 and found most did not monitor the air. 
  Some intend to start and the Government is to set up a 
further 12 "enhanced urban monitoring sites" that will measure 
five key pollutants. Friends of the Earth said, however, that 
even when all the new sites were operational, 20 of the largest 
towns and cities would still have no nitrogen dioxide 
monitoring, 23 would fail to monitor sulphur dioxide and 24 
would not check ozone levels. 
  The survey also reveals how often the main pollutants exceed 
international guidelines. The figures for 1992 show that levels 
of ozone, which aggravates bronchitis and asthma but also 
affects normally healthy adults, exceeded World Health 
Organisation guidelines on 269 days at 21 monitoring sites. 
Levels of nitrogen oxide exceeded guidelines on 60 days at four 
London sites, and Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield also 
reported several days with worrying levels. 
  High levels of sulphur dioxide, which comes mostly from 
power 
stations and heavy industry, were recorded on 100 days at the 
two worst sites in central Belfast and Barnsley, South Yorkshire. 
  "The figures show what a chronic problem air pollution has 
become, especially for the millions of people at risk," Fiona 
Weir, senior pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said. 
  Her concern is shared by the Environment Department, 
although 
not by the rest of the Government, according to health experts. 
In a recent report on environmental protection, civil servants 
at the department admitted that Britain's commitment to reducing 
nitrogen oxide emissions this year "will be a tougher target 
than we had expected." 
  The report continued: "In the longer term, traffic growth in 
line with current projections could ultimately reverse the 
improvements we will secure from new vehicle standards." The 
civil servants also expressed concern at the continuing high 
levels of sulphur dioxide recorded in Belfast. 
  Scientists accept that none of the guidelines by which air 
pollution is measured can address the problem of inhaling 
several different pollutants and it is this immeasurable 
cocktail that is causing the greatest concern. 
  Friends of the Earth believes the figures underestimate the 
problem because of the shortage of monitoring sites. Britain has 
only seven sites, designed in compliance with European 
directives to measure nitrogen dioxide, compared with 53 in The 
Netherlands, 85 in France and 200 in Germany. 
  It also criticised the Government for the way it monitored 
ozone levels, warning people of poor air quality only when the 
levels exceeded high-peak figures. 
  Friends of the Earth believes that people should be warned 
of 
poor air when lower limits are breached for eight-hour periods.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall, environment correspondent: "Ozone </F>
Levels Over Britain `Threatening Food Chain'"] 
  [Text] The Earth's protective ozone is at a record low over 
Britain and there are fears that the resulting high levels of 
ultraviolet light could affect pollinating insects and the 
growth of seedlings. 
  Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said 
yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting 
chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of 
next century. 
  By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen 
could be equivalent to those in mid-France. 
  Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit 
and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in 
1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and 
"pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain." 
  He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had 
been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and 
insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may 
damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging 
their genetic material. 
  As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical 
researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise. The 
UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer 
will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million 
cataracts. 
  Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone 
review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people 
took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun 
cream. 
  The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by 
the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office, 
assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and 
field work. It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the 
average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per 
cent. Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone 
slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993. 
  The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to 
unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and 
persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991. 
  They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up 
of 
chlorine chemicals. Such chemicals, released from products such 
as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been 
shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the 
first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over 
the northern hemisphere. 
  The scientists said that measures under the Montreal 
Protocol 
to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by 
1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off. 
Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone 
killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between 
2000 and 2005. This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent 
average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records 
began in 1979. Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was 
unlikely to disappear until 2080. 
  The scientists also called on the Government to save 
Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the 
Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire. Last week 
The Times reported that the plane, which is involved 
in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence 
hit list. While America and Germany are building new research 
aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes. 
  Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research, 
but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of 
international importance.

<F P=106> [press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F>
Ratification of the Basel Convention] 
  [Text] Environment Minister, Robert Atkins, today 
announced that the United Kingdom's ratification of the UNEP [UN 
Environment Program] Basel Convention will enable it to become a 
Party on the same date, 8 May, as the European Community. The 
Convention helps to ensure environmentally sound management of 
exported wastes. In answer to a written Parliamentary Question 
from George Kynoch MP (Kincardine and Deeside), Mr Atkins said: 
  "The United Kingdom deposited its instrument of ratification 
for the Basel Convention on 7 February. This means that the 
United Kingdom will become a Party to the Convention on 8 May. 
The EC will also become a Party on 8 May.'' 
  "The Convention provides a framework for states to control 
shipments of hazardous waste. Where these do occur, the onus is 
on the exporting state to ensure environmentally sound 
management of the wastes. Shipments are not allowed between 
Parties and non- Parties without specific agreements. Parties 
may ban imports of waste.'' 
  "The Waste Shipments Regulation (259/93/EEC), which 
incorporates the obligations of the Basel Convention will apply 
on 6 May. The Regulation will enable the UK to control more 
effectively waste imports and exports. The Regulation covers 
shipments destined for the recovery operations, as well as those 
going for final disposal.'' 
  "The UK is firmly committed to the objectives of the Basel 
Convention. We have been making voluntary financial 
contributions to the running of the Convention each year since 
1990." 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Basel 
Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of 
Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal provides a framework for 
states to control movements of hazardous waste. Where shipments 
do occur, the Convention provides for a global system of 
environmental controls in which the onus is on the exporting 
state to ensure environmentally sound management of the wastes. 
Shipments are not allowed between Parties and non-Parties 
without specific agreements. Parties to the Convention may ban 
imports of waste. 
  The UK ratified the Convention on 7 February, the same date 
as the EC. Both the UK and the EC will become Parties on 8 May 
(the Convention provides for a 90 day period between the date of 
depositing the instrument of ratification and becoming a Party). 
The EC Waste Shipments Regulation (259/93/EEC), which implements 
the obligations of the Basel Convention in the Community, will 
apply on 6 May. 
  The new Regulation, which supersedes the existing 
Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste Regulations 1988 
(implementing EC Directive 84/631/EEC, as amended), will enable 
the UK to exercise strict controls over imports and exports of 
waste. For waste exports, responsibility will lie with the UK as 
the exporter to ensure that the waste will be handled in an 
environmentally sound manner in the country of destination. The 
Basel Convention is administered by a Secretariat based in 
Geneva. The Secretariat is financed by contributions from 
Parties and other signatories, including the UK.

<F P=106> [Speech by John Gummer, UK Secretary of the Environment: </F>
"Four-Point Plan for Businesses To Reduce CO2 Emissions"] 
  [Text] Business should follow a four-point plan of action 
if it is to help reduce the threat of climate change and become 
more energy efficient, Environment Secretary John Gummer said 
today. 
  Speaking at the London launch of "Climate Change: The 
Challenge and the Opportunities", the 1994 Energy Efficiency 
Roadshows, a series of high profile regional conferences and 
exhibitions featuring top speakers from all sectors of industry 
and commerce, Mr Gummer said: 
  "Although the UK economy has grown by a quarter since 1979, 
we are still using the same amount of energy. With cost 
effective improvements, some 20 per cent of current energy 
demand can be cut, therefore cutting CO2 emissions and helping 
to reduce the threat of climate change.'' 
  "Everyone - from local and central Government, households, 
businesses and the public sector - has a part to play. 
Businesses, which account for nearly half of all UK CO2 
emissions, should aim to implement a four-point plan of action:'' 
  "First - board level commitment must be made to energy 
management. The 'Making a Corporate Commitment' campaign is the 
ideal vehicle. It calls for the development of energy and fuel 
efficient strategies, and asks organisations to set performance 
improvement targets and ensure that plans are considered 
regularly at board level;'' 
  "Secondly - energy management must be integrated with other 
environmental initiatives and with environmental reporting;'' 
  "Thirdly - combined heat and power [CHP] schemes produce 
more 
energy than by conventional electricity generation. CHP produces 
fewer greenhouse gases and fuel bills are in many cases up to 40 
per cent lower; and'' 
  "Finally - we need to encourage good habits at home which 
will be carried over to the work-place - and vice versa. The 
need to change attitudes and habits is just as great as making 
buildings, products and technologies more energy efficient." 
<H5>  Mr Gummer Continued: </H5>
  "With this plan, the Government can look confidently at a 
partnership with business to save 2.5 million tonnes of carbon 
by the year 2000. And I am pleased to announce the launch next 
week of Energy Advice Week, which will be encouraging 
householders to become energy efficient and save money on fuel 
bills. This emphasises the Government's commitment to energy 
efficiency in all sectors of the community - indeed, we are 
encouraging the domestic sector to cut its carbon emissions by 4 
million tonnes by the end of the century.'' 
  "The Week, which runs from 12 to 20 February, aims to make 
the public aware of the simple energy efficiency measures they 
can take every day, and will provide advice and information on 
how to make savings of up 100 pounds annually on fuel bills."

"Air Quality Standards For Benzene Recommended"] 
  [Text] An air quality standard has been recommended for 
benzene in the United Kingdom and daily monitoring of levels of 
benzene in air is to be made available to the public. 
  The recommendation has been made by the Government's 
independent Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards, chaired by 
Professor Anthony Seaton, Aberdeen University. The Panel have 
assessed available health and air quality data on benzene and 
have recommended: 
  "An air quality standard for benzene in the United Kingdom 
of 
5ppb [parts per billion] as a running annual average. We also 
recommend that this standard be reduced to the lower level of 1 
ppb running annual average, and that the Government set a target 
date by which this be achieved. 
  These recommendations are intended to reduce the levels of 
exposure of the population to benzene such that ambient air 
pollution is no longer the main source of individual exposure, 
even for non-smokers. It is intended that techniques for 
monitoring the standard be consistent with those of the 
Department of the Environment's Enhanced Urban Network." 
  Commenting on the recommendation, Environment Minister 
Robert 
Atkins said: "I am grateful for the Panel's work. It provides an 
essential yardstick by which the Government's policies on air 
pollution can be judged. The Government will consider the 
Panel's recommendations on benzene very carefully, and looks 
forward to receiving its proposals on standards for other 
pollutants in due course.'' 
  "Now that the work of the Panel is beginning to bear fruit, 
I 
propose shortly to publish a consultation paper which will 
discuss how air quality standards should operate and ways in 
which they can be achieved. The Government will consider how the 
recommended Standard could be used in this context and over what 
time scale the target Standard could be met." 
<H5>  The Minister Added: </H5>
  "I am pleased to announce today that my Department will 
shortly provide daily information on levels of benzene in air to 
the public. This information will come from our new Enhanced 
Urban Monitoring Network and will be included as part of the air 
quality bulletin service available on Ceefax, Teletext and 
Freephone." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  Benzene is an organic chemical which is known to cause 
cancer 
in humans. The main source of atmospheric benzene in the UK is 
petrol vehicle exhausts (78 percent in 1991). 
  The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards was established 
following the Government's commitment in the 1990 White Paper 
"This Common Inheritance" to set up a Panel to recommend air 
quality standards for the United Kingdom. It is chaired by 
Professor Anthony Seaton, Head of Environmental and Occupational 
Medicine at the Aberdeen University Medical School and members 
include medical and air pollution experts. 
  The report is the first in a series which will make 
recommendations for other pollutants suggested to the Panel by 
the Government. Recommendations on ozone, carbon monoxide, 1,3 
butadiene, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulates 
are expected in due course. 
  As part of the Government's 4 million pounds per annum 
national air pollution monitoring network, DOE is establishing a 
network of 12 sites around the country where continuous 
monitoring of benzene (and up to 26 other organic chemical 
pollutant gases) will take place. The first 7 of these sites are 
in operation at Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh London 
Bloomsbury, London Eltham and Middlesbrough. Daily information 
on benzene levels will shortly be made available to the public 
via the Department of the Environment's air quality bulletin 
service (Freephone 0800-556677, Ceefax Page 404 and Teletext 
Page 187). 
  The report is available from HMSO, ISBN 0-11-752859-5, 
priced 
5.95 pounds.

"Taking Rio Forward: the Government's Climate Change Programme 
Launched"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major and Environment Secretary, 
John Gummer, today launched Britain's national programme for 
combatting the threat of global climate change. 
  Published today following extensive consultation, the 
Programme is intended to meet the UK's commitments under the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Rio in 1992. 
More than 160 countries have signed the Convention; over 50 have 
now ratified it, and it will come into force on 21 March. 
Britain is one of the first to publish a detailed programme of 
measures to show how it will implement the Convention's 
requirements. 
  Since signing the Convention at the Earth Summit in Rio, the 
Prime Minister has taken a lead in seeking to persuade other 
leading countries to implement it as speedily as possible. In 
his foreword to the Programme, the Prime Minister says: 
  "In order to help encourage a prompt start to action, I 
pledged at the time that the UK would produce a programme of 
measures to implement the Convention's commitments as quickly as 
possible. This programme fulfils that pledge." 
<H5>  Mr. Major stresses: </H5>
  "The threat of climate change cannot be tackled by any one 
country or group of countries in isolation; it requires a global 
response. The Convention we signed at Rio represents an 
important first step towards providing the framework for such a 
response.'' 
  "At the same time, the measures required to tackle the 
problem cannot simply be decreed by governments; they depend on 
decisions and actions taken by all individual citizens in their 
daily lives. For this reason, this Programme was drawn up after 
widespread consultation within the United Kingdom. It seeks to 
harness the efforts of all sectors of our society and the 
participation of all our people in meeting the challenge for the 
sake of future generations." 
  The Convention places a number of obligations on countries. 
Chief among these for developed countries is a commitment to 
take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases 
to 1990 levels by 2000. Britain is the first country in the 
world to demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this 
for each of the three main greenhouse gases. 
  For carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, the 
Programme is designed to achieve savings equivalent to 10 
million tonnes of carbon (6 percent) against projected emissions 
in 2000. This should ensure a return to 1990 levels. It 
encompasses a wide variety of measures, (detailed in the 
attached table). 
  For the other main greenhouse gases, the programme in fact 
envisages reducing emissions by 2000: by 10 percent for methane, 
by 75 percent for nitrous oxide, as well as substantial 
reductions for other, less significant greenhouse gases. 
Overall, taking account of the relative importance of each gas, 
the Programme should achieve a reduction equivalent to some 5 
percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the UK by the year 2000. 
  The Programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out some 
of the longer term options for action that may need to be 
considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and 
the further development of the Convention. It emphasises that: 
  "As we enter the next Century, new and difficult choices may 
have to be made if we are to achieve a sustainable future. We 
will need to find ways of breaking the link between economic 
development and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases." In 
the transport sector in particular, "to have any major impact on 
projected trends, measures would be required that would change 
current patterns of transport use. People may not always be able 
to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as before .. 
Individuals will have to reconcile their desire for travel with 
their desire to protect the environment for future generations." 
A copy of the Programme's summary is attached. 
<H5>  Note to Editors </H5>
  The Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by 
over 
150 countries at the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. It will 
come into force on 21 March, 3 months after 50 countries have 
ratified (that is, agreed to be bound by its obligations). The 
UK ratified on 8 December 1993 (DOE Press Release 832 of 3 
December). 
  The Convention sets out a framework for an international 
approach to tackling the problem of global warming. It requires 
developed country Parties to: 
  -- take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse 
gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 
  -- provide assistance to developing countries. 
  All Parties are bound by other obligations on compiling 
inventories of emissions, on producing and publishing national 
programmes of measures to limit emissions, on promoting research 
and public education about climate change. 
Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. On current 
projections, the Convention commitment means finding savings in 
UK CO2 emissions equivalent to some 10 million tonnes of carbon. 
The Government conducted a major consultation exercise earlier 
this year on the options for achieving this reduction. In July, 
the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the 
Government's proposals, subject to finalisation of some aspects 
of the package (DOE press release 507 of 26 July 1992). 
  The package was completed with the announcement in the 
Budget 
on 30 November that petrol and other road fuel duties were to be 
increased by a further 3 pence per litre (8-10 percent) 
immediately, and with increases in future years averaging at 
least 5 percent above the rate of inflation. Press Enquiries:

"Taking Rio Forward: Biodiversity Action Plan Published"] 
  [Text] A plan to make the conservation of wildlife an 
integral part of Government programmes, policy and action, 
"Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan", was published today by the 
Prime Minister, John Major, and Environment Secretary, John 
Gummer. 
  The plan was launched as part of a package of documents 
which 
represent the UK Government's response to the Rio "Earth 
Summit". It outlines the UK's role in conserving biodiversity at 
home and abroad. 
  The plan, drawn up after extensive consultation, provides a 
strategy for the next 10 and 20 years and sets out 59 specific 
commitments to forward action. It emphasises what can be done at 
the local level to raise public awareness and involvement in 
conserving local biodiversity and pride in local distinctiveness. 
  The Government commits itself to conserve, and where 
possible 
enhance: 
  -- the overall populations and natural ranges of native 
species and the quality and range of wildlife habitats and 
ecosystems; 
  -- internationally important and threatened species, 
habitats 
and ecosystems; 
  -- species, habitats and natural and managed ecosystems that 
are characteristic of local areas; 
  -- the biodiversity of natural and semi-natural habitats 
where this has been diminished over recent decades. 
  A "Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group" will be created 
to take forward the commitments outlined in the plan. The Group 
will oversee the development of a full range of specific costed 
targets for key species and habitats for the years 2000 and 
2010, to be published in European Nature Conservation Year 1995. 
In addition it will supervise the work proposed in the plan to 
improve the accessibility of wildlife data, encourage public 
awareness of and involvement in biodiversity, and review the 
delivery of the commitments contained in the Plan. 
  The Steering Group will operate as a partnership between 
central and local government, agencies, collections, leading

<F P=106> [Speech by John Gummer, Department of the Environment: "We </F>
Must Learn Different Ways of Living"] 
  [Text] A fundamental change in lifestyle is vital if we are 
to protect our world for future generations, Environment 
Secretary John Gummer said today. 
  Speaking at the launch of the UK Government's "Response to 
Rio" documents, Mr Gummer said: 
  "Do we have to wait until disaster overwhelms us before we 
make the radical changes necessary to protect our world for 
future generations? That is the vital challenge of sustainable 
development. If we act now there is much that can be saved which 
will otherwise disappear forever. Yet we cannot allow our proper 
concern to blind us to mankind's need to change and develop. A 
society which does not grow is one which cannot satisfy some of 
our basic human needs. Economic development is just as important 
a concept as environmental protection, and we must find ways of 
achieving both together.'' 
  Mr Gummer outlined two new initiatives designed to stimulate 
lifestyle change. He said: 
  "In addition to the Panel which the Prime Minister announced 
today, I propose to set up a UK Round Table on Sustainable 
Development. This Round Table will bring together 
representatives of the main sectors and groups to discuss major 
issues of sustainable development with Government Ministers. 
And we must not forget the key part to be played by individuals 
in developing a more sustainable world. The Government will 
stimulate a new citizen's environment initiative to encourage 
the growth of interest in these issues, with full consultation 
with voluntary bodies, local authorities, churches and other 
community groups". 
  Mr Gummer went on to outline the three plans launched by the 
Prime Minister today as a result of commitments he made at Rio. 
<H5>  He Said: </H5>
  "'Sustainable Development: The UK Strategy' sets out, by 
environmental resource and by economic sector, our position 
today and projections of where we might be in twenty years on 
current policies. It looks at the principles of sustainable 
development, at the problems and opportunities which we face in 
the UK and internationally, and at the processes we have, or 
which we could develop, for implementing these principles and 
for monitoring progress.'' 
  "With the publication of 'Climate Change: A UK Strategy', 
Britain is giving a lead in showing what can and must be done to 
tackle the threat of global warming. The Climate Change 
Convention places a number of obligations on countries. Chief 
among these for developed countries is to take measures aimed at 
returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000. 
I believe Britain is the first country in the world to 
demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this for each of 
the main greenhouse gases.'' 
  "The programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out 
some 
of the longer term options for action that may need to be 
considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and 
the further development of the Convention. New and difficult 
choices, affecting every one of us, may have to be made if we 
are to avoid the risk of altering the climate of our planet in 
ways which could have serious implications for future 
generations.'' 
  "This is the first time that a UK Government has produced a 
document drawing together programmes and targets for the 
conservation of wildlife and habitats. The publication of 
'Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan' demonstrates our commitment 
to the Biodiversity Convention. The central tenet of the 
Convention is that action must be taken to halt the world wide 
loss of animal and plant species and genetic resources.'' 
  "To accelerate progress, we will set up a Steering Group, 
with representatives from central and local government, 
agencies, collections, academic bodies and other 
non-governmental organisations. This Steering Group will oversee 
the development of a range of targets for biodiversity. The UK 
has a real contribution to make to the richness of the world's 
wildlife; this Action Plan sets out a strategy for the next 20 
years, challenging us to take action now to enable our children 
and future generations to enjoy the countryside and landscapes 
which are the natural heritage of this country.'' 
  "We need a sense of urgency as well as a realisation of the 
need for global involvement. Urgency because time is running 
out. And global involvement because without it the efforts of 
individual nations will be undermined by those who refuse to 
shoulder their proper burdens. The United Kingdom is determined 
to make sustainable development the touchstone of its policies. 
We recognise that this means a change of attitudes throughout 
the nation. That change cannot be achieved overnight, but that 
gives no grounds for defeatism -- it should instead act as a 
spur to action. These documents are only the beginning. Year by 
year we shall need to revise and refine our policies so that our 
economy can grown in a way which does not cheat on our children." 
<H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>
  The Prime Minister made a commitment on his return from the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED 
or the Earth Summit) held in Rio in June 1992 that the UK would 
prepare a national plan on sustainable development by the end of 
1993 and submit a report to the new UN Commission on Sustainable 
Development. The other EC and G7 countries subsequently made a 
similar commitment. These commitment follow on from Agenda 21, 
the action programme agreed at UNCED, which called for national 
sustainable development strategies to be adopted and for reports 
on the implementation of Agenda 21 to be made to the new UN 
Commission on Sustainable Development. 
  The most widely accepted definition of sustainable 
development is that given in the report of the 1987 World 
Commission on Environment and Development (the "Bruntland" 
report): 
  "Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable - 
development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs." 
  The Strategy contains an examination of environmental media 
and resources, both now and projected forwards over 20 years on 
current policies (air, atmosphere, water, land, soil, minerals, 
wildlife and population); a consideration of economic 
development and sustainability (including transport, 
agriculture, energy, business, waste development and 
construction, and leisure); and a discussion on putting 
sustainability into practice (ways in which different sectors of 
society can contribute to achieving sustainable development, 
including fundamental instruments such as science and research, 
the planning system, and the three new measures for encouraging 
participation and discussion on sustainable development). 
  The Strategy follows a year of consultation between central 
government Departments, local authorities, businesses, voluntary 
groups, academics, scientists and the general public in the UK. 
This has included: 
  -- a seminar in Oxford in March 1993, with over 100 
attendees 
of whom around 70 were from outside central government; 
  -- a wide range of meetings between government officials 
from 
a number of Departments and representatives of other 
organisations; 
  -- a consultation paper issued in July 1993 and sent to over 
6,000 groups and individuals, to which more than 500 responses 
were received. 
  Free summaries of the Sustainable Development Strategy are 
available from Department of the Environment, PO Box 151, London 
E15 2HF. The full strategy (Cm 2426) is available from HMSO 
bookshops and agents, priced at (22 pounds) (ISBN 
0-10-124262-x).

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent: "US </F>
Uranium Imported for British Shells"] 
  [Text] Large quantities of depleted military uranium are 
being imported from America to manufacture armour piercing 
shells for British forces in the knowledge that they would 
contaminate large areas if used. 
  British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), which operates the Sellafield 
reprocessing works, is importing the uranium and making the 
shells at its Springfield Works at Preston in Lancashire. The 
company is acting as an agent for the Ministry of Defence. 
  The extent of BNFL's role as a weapons manufacturer -- 
hitherto unknown outside a small circle of nuclear workers and 
the ministry -- is revealed in a US government export licence, a 
copy of which has been obtained by The Guardian. 
  It was granted in October for the sale of 158,758 
kilogrammes 
of depleted uranium. This would be sufficient to make tens of 
thousands of armour-piercing, anti-tank rounds. 
  In the wake of increasing suggestions that some Gulf war 
veterans are suffering from mystery illnesses and their children 
from deformities, the use of highly toxic uranium and the 
vapourising element beryllium for the tips of British shells is 
highly sensitive. 
  Investigations into the possible causes of the so-called 
Gulf 
syndrome in the US centre on the use of chemical, biological, 
and viruses by the Iraqis and uranium shells by the Allies. 
  The shells were used in earnest for the first time in the 
Gulf war and an estimated 40 tonnes of depleted uranium was left 
on the battlefield, mostly in the form of toxic and radioactive 
dust. 
  Contamination is at its worst when tanks are hit by shells, 
destroying the vehicles, and in the resultant fire uranium dust 
is spread in a wide area. No clean up has been attempted in 
Kuwait and much of the uranium dust is now scattered about in 
the thousands of square miles of desert covered by the battle. 
Some 4,000 US uranium-tipped tank rounds were fired and a 
smaller number from British guns. 
  The success of uranium and beryllium tipped weapons in 
armour 
piercing has inspired the Ministry of Defence to step up 
production. Uranium is two and a half times as dense as steel 
and penetrates armour more effectively than the tungsten, copper 
and nickel alloy currently used. 
  An initial licence issued to BNFL by the Americans on 
October 
5, 1993, expiring on January 31, 1995, allows BNFL to import the 
depleted uranium. The BNFL shells are believed to be exclusively 
for British forces but the US licence allows for export to Nato 
countries. 
  Royal Ordnance, owned by British Aerospace, is also making 
120 millimetre uranium-tipped shells for British tanks using 
imported US uranium. 
  The Ministry has been questioned by a number of MPs about 
its 
testing of uranium-tipped weapons at firing ranges in Scotland 
and Cumbria. 
  Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, visited 
Kirkcudbright, in Galloway on September 21, to reassure local 
people that there was no health risk from test firings of the 
shells at the Ministry's Dundrennan test sight. Around 4,000 
test shells have been fired there in the last 10 years.

"Whitehall Muddies the Waters"] 
  [Text] In 1983, Michael Heseltine, the Environment 
Secretary, launched a high-profile campaign to resuscitate the 
near-lifeless waters of the Mersey Basin. The estuary and the 
numerous rivers that feed it, poisoned daily by tens of millions 
of gallons of raw sewage and toxic industrial waste, symbolised 
a dramatic decline in the health of Britain's rivers following 
decades of government neglect. 
  Mr Heseltine pledged that the &pound;4 billion Mersey Basin 
Campaign, with investment spread over 25 years, would bring back 
plentiful fish life to one of Europe's most polluted waterways. 
The dumping of untreated factory waste and sewage, he said, had 
created `an environmental disaster which is an affront to the 
standards which people rightly now expect.' 
  Ten years on, the flagship clean-up programme is in jeopardy 
because of Ministers' determination to dishonour a decade of 
political promises in order to avoid unpopular increases in 
water bills. 
  Almost half of the Mersey Basin's 500 miles of waterway 
remains classified by the National Rivers Authority as `grossly 
polluted' -- that is, unable to support life, useless for 
drinking water and dangerous to swim in. 
  Leaked Whitehall correspondence passed to The 
Observer confirms the Mersey Basin is one of many pollution 
blackspots where clean-up efforts are likely to be postponed 
into the next century to keep down costs for the privatised 
water companies. 
  A letter from Neil Summerton, head of the Department of the 
Environment's Water Services Directorate, to Ed Gallagher, chief 
executive of the NRA, makes it clear that the Government plans 
to break repeated promises to establish a national programme of 
legally binding water quality standards for the 26,000 miles of 
rivers in England and Wales. Ministers have been promising since 
1986 to introduce these standards, known as statutory water 
quality objectives, coupled with compulsory clean-up targets for 
water companies and industry. 
  The NRA's regional offices have drawn up draft standards 
aimed at reducing levels of sewage, industrial and agricultural 
pollution discharged into rivers. And, two years ago, the 
authority stated that it aimed to clean up most of Britain's 
2,500 miles of `grossly polluted' rivers by 1995. 
  But the letter to Mr Gallagher states that John Gummer, the 
Environment Secretary, and John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, 
have decided that `in general' there should be no allowances 
made for spending by water companies to meet these river quality 
targets in 1995-2000. 
  The only exceptions are likely to be `high-profile schemes 
that Ministers would wish to proceed because of the political 
commitments that have been given.' The Mersey Basin, it 
adds,`may ... fall into that category.' 
  Other long-awaited programmes to clean up Britain's most 
polluted rivers -- including the Aire, the Tees, the Trent and 
the Tame -- by the end of the decade are also in serious 
jeopardy, say NRA sources. All are virtually lifeless waterways, 
polluted by sewage debris and stinking industrial effluent. 
  Ministers claim expenditure on meeting river quality targets 
must be postponed because of the high cost of reducing sewage 
pollution under the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive of 
1991, which threatens to increase water bills substantially. The 
European law will set minimum standards for sewage outlets to 
rivers and coastal waters serving more than 10,000 people. 
  But environmentalists fear that the clean-up will not be as 
stringent as the NRA's planned targets for the worst pollution 
blackspots. They claim the Government will set the lowest levels 
of treatment allowed under the directive for ecologically 
sensitive rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. 
  They argue that these sites, including important wildlife 
sanctuaries, will be properly protected only under a 
comprehensive national programme. 
  Andres Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, 
said: `Ministers are using the fear of higher water bills as an 
excuse for reneging on repeated promises to set tough national 
water quality standards. 
  `Instead of forcing the public to finance the clean-up out 
of 
current charges, they should be required to cut their record 
profits and spread the clean-up costs over a longer period of 
time.'

<F P=106> [Daniel Green article: "Errors In the Name of Ecology"] </F>
  [Text] Could two decades of environmental policy have been 
mistaken? Have the US, Germany, Switzerland and many other 
countries unnecessarily forced changes on their industries and 
consumers in the name of ecology? Yes, according to the 
Phosphate Report [note] published today by Landbank, an 
environmental consultancy. 
  The report is a life-cycle study which examines the 
environmental impact of two kinds of detergents, phosphate-based 
and zeolite-based. Such studies try to take into account every 
aspect of the production and use of a product from raw material 
extraction to waste disposal. 
  Phosphates have been blamed for high levels of nutrients in 
rivers and lakes that lead to the dominance of algae over other 
life forms. Many countries have banned detergent phosphates as 
a result and encouraged a switch to zeolites. 
  But the report concludes that there is virtually no 
difference between the environmental effect of the two types of 
detergent, if all aspects of production and consumption are 
taken into account. 
  It is a conclusion that might have been expected, given that 
the report was sponsored by UK phosphate manufacturer Albright 
and Wilson, owned by the Tenneco industrial group of the U.S. 
  But the two authors insist that they have been independent 
and objective. Their credentials help: one is Bryn Jones, once 
director of lobby group Greenpeace, the other is Bob Wilson, 
formerly a senior lecturer in statistics. 
  They also claim that their report breaks new ground in thc 
controversial area of life-cycle analysis, a technique notorious 
for producing disagreements among experts. 
  They pin their hopes on the Delphi Technique to iron out 
these differences. This method requires a panel of experts to 
give their views by completing an anonymous questionnaire. The 
results are summarised and fed back to the panel. 
  The panel members are invited to reconsider their position, 
or give arguments about why they are right. These arguments are 
then distributed to the panel again. The process remains 
anonymous and can be repeated until a consensus is achieved or 
irreconcilable positions established. 
  For the Phosphate Report, the panel assessed the 
environmental impact of 39 products generated by the likes of 
phosphate mining, road transport of materials and electricity 
generation for manufacturing plants. 
  Each expert gave a score for the environmental impact of 
each 
pollutant generated during the life cycle of the two types of 
detergent. 
  When the scores were added up, phosphate detergents scored 
107 environmental impact points, and zeolite detergents 110 
points. Jones gives the error as 10 per cent. 
  This alone should bolster the case against banning 
phosphates 
but the report is not finished yet. In its final section, the 
authors argue that it is much easier to take phosphates than 
zeolites out of waste water. 
  Sweden already strips phosphates out of waste water and has 
banned advertisements that claim that zeolites are greener. 
  There are signs of a rethink in Switzerland, where detergent 
phosphates were banned in 1986 and phosphate-stripping plants 
built to protect lakes. The report quotes Ulrich Zimmerman, 
head of water quality for the Zurich Water Authority, calling 
for the ban on detergent phosphates to be revoked on the grounds 
that it has failed to improve water quality. 
  The report concludes with several recommendations ranging 
from a call for zeolite detergent manufacturers to abandon 
eco-friendly labels to a suggestion that wind power be used to 
supplement electricity supplies at Albright and Wilson's 
phosphate plant on the Cumbrian coast. 
  Of at least as much interest to consumers is the finding 
that 
phosphates are better cleansers: almost 1.5 times as much 
zeolite detergent is needed to produce the same cleaning effect. 
  Swiss consumers have discovered this already. Their 
increased consumption of zeolite detergents, specialist stain 
removers and water softening machines may have been behind a 
rise in foaming at water treatment works, the report claims.

<F P=106> [Susan Watts report: "Staff Fear Budget Cuts Will Ground </F>
'Snoopy' Aircraft"] 
  [Text] The future of "Snoopy", an RAF [Royal Air Force] 
Hercules adapted to form an airborne laboratory, looks 
increasingly uncertain as defence budget cuts bite deep. 
  The C130 aircraft, named Snoopy because of its 22-foot red 
and white striped nosepiece, is guaranteed funding only until 1 
April 1995, despite world-wide acclaim for its atmospheric 
research. Its scientific crew fear Snoopy will be grounded 
beyond that date. 
  Defence chiefs are expected to rubberstamp the funding 
decision at a budget meeting on Wednesday. Snoopy will at least 
have a breathing space -- its crew had braced itself for news 
that the money would run out this Easter. 
  The aircraft, based at Farnborough, Hampshire, is owned and 
run as one of the Ministry of Defence's 59-strong RAF Hercules 
fleet. The Meteorological Office [Met Office] pays for Snoopy's 
technical crew and equipment at a cost of around 800,000 pounds 
a year. 
  Met Office staff take part in numerous international 
research 
projects, and it pays its contribution to costs in Swiss francs. 
The fall in the value of the pound at the end of 1992 left the 
Met Office overdrawn on its budget by several million pounds -- 
hence the squeeze on Snoopy. Its future could only be 
guaranteed if currency fluctuations swing the other way. 
  An RAF spokesman conceded that Snoopy was under review, but 
no more or less than any other asset as part of a broad 
assessment of all defence-related projects. "To say Snoopy 
faces the axe would be to anticipate the outcome of that 
review," he added. 
  The aircraft came to public attention after a trip to the 
Gulf during which it flew through the thick, black smoke plumes 
of the Kuwaiti oil fires -- analysing the level of pollutants to 
help predict their health threat. 
  By "sniffing" the air with its extended snout, Snoopy has 
helped to improve weather forecasting and long-term computer 
models of climate change. John Pyle, one of Britain's experts 
on the ozone hole and chairman of the UK Stratospheric Ozone 
Review Group, said the loss "would be a tragedy for atmospheric 
science in this country". 
  In a few weeks' time a scientific paper in the journal 
Nature, produced using data gathered in Snoopy, is expected to 
help explain why forecasts of global warming have proved wide of 
the mark -- one of the most baffling questions facing 
atmospheric science. Snoopy's research suggests a second group 
of man-made pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, is slowing 
down the warming effect of artificial greenhouse gases. 
  Many eminent scientists, from the UK and overseas, have 
written to the Met Office, protesting at Snoopy's threatened 
demise. A team from the US National Center for Atmospheric 
Research in Boulder, Colorado, recently visited the Farnborough 
group for advice on fitting out a joint US/German Hercules for 
atmospheric research. 
  Snoopy flies two or three times a week, clocking up about 
500 
hours a year. It is booked up for years ahead by research teams 
from all over the world. In October, Snoopy is due to be the 
only aircraft taking part in a simulated major nuclear accident. 
A few kilograms of a chemical compound called perfluorocarbon 
will be released high over Brittany and its spread around Europe 
monitored.

<F P=106> [Vivek Chaudhary report: "Protests After Indian Ocean </F>
N-Base Left Out of Green Plan"] 
  [Text] British green groups are unhappy at the omission 
from a government conservation plan of a British territory in 
the Indian Ocean, rich in natural resources but also containing 
a vital US nuclear base. 
  The British Indian Ocean Territory, considered to be of 
"outstanding international conservation importance", includes 
the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only US 
nuclear base in the Indian Ocean. 
  It failed to appear in the Government's action plan on 
biodiversity last week -- drawn up in response to the 'Earth 
Summit' in Rio -- despite featuring in a draft version. 
  The territory lies just south of the equator approximately 
2,000 miles off the coast of Keyna. It was bought by Britain 
from Mauritius for 3 million pounds in 1965. A Royal Navy 
detachment is based there and Diego Garcia was the refuelling 
point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq during the Gulf 
war. 
  The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's 
largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds 
and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs. 
  Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the 
Environment asking why it has been left out of the conservation 
plan.

<F P=106> [Speech by UK Secretary of State for the Environment John </F>
Gummer at a London Authority conference in London on 23 
February: "Improving Air Quality"] 
  [Text] In the Sustainable Development Strategy, launched by 
John Major earlier this month, we identified the continued 
improvement of urban air quality as one of the major challenges 
we face in the United Kingdom if the broad objectives of 
sustainability are to be secured. Today I want to tell you how 
we plan to move towards that objective. 
  Improving air quality is not an abstract, theoretical 
matter. 
It is a concern for large numbers of our citizens and an 
important commitment of the government. 
  Much has already been achieved. On new cars, for example, 
stringent exhaust emission standards now mean that catalysts are 
a standard feature. And new diesel vehicles emit substantially 
less smoke than we have become used to seeing in the past. All 
existing vehicles are now checked for emissions in the annual 
test to make sure that they are kept in a good state of tune. We 
also have a comprehensive system for control of industrial air 
pollution which the establishment of the Environment Agency will 
further strengthen. These measures mean that we have seen a 
progressive improvement in the quality of our air which should 
continue over the next decade. 
  But new concerns are emerging. As increasing evidence 
becomes 
available of possible links between air pollution and 
respiratory disease, we need to continue to question whether 
enough is being done and then to identify areas where further 
improvements can be made. 
  To set out the way forward I shall shortly publish a 
consultation paper as the basis for a strategy to be published 
in the Autumn. 
<H3>  But Let Me Outline Now What I Believe Should Be the Key 
Elements. </H3>
  First, Air Quality Standards We must move quickly to get a 
comprehensive set of health-related air quality standards in 
place. In some areas, it may be some years before ambitious 
targets can be achieved. But what is important is that we must 
know where sustainability lies. We must know what acceptable air 
quality is so that we can plan accordingly. There are some 
standards already in place and we should build upon those. I 
recognise also that the European Community is likely to bring 
forward proposals over the next year or two. But I do not 
believe we can wait. We must move ahead and link with our 
European partners in due course. We have already made some 
progress, notably with work on benzene and ozone this year. More 
will follow rapidly over the coming months. 
  Second, Local Air Quality Management In our paper we shall 
review the national policies, particularly emission controls and 
economic instruments, which should help us move progressively 
toward national targets. But air is inevitably also a local 
matter, on which there must be local action. In areas where air 
quality is particularly at risk, we need to be able to 
coordinate our controls over domestic, industrial and vehicle 
emissions to secure the most cost effective improvements. Local 
authorities, the new Environment Agency and other bodies will 
have a part to play here. We need to draw on the strengths of 
our local planning system. When air pollution episodes arise we 
need to be sure people can be informed, not only so that they 
can take defensive action where necessary, but also so that they 
can act in a sensible way in their use of vehicles and other 
sources of pollution. In short, we must get to grips with the 
need locally to manage our air quality. 
  Third, The Role of the Car is Critical Exhaust emissions are 
the source of most air pollution in our urban areas. John 
MacGregor and I are at one in the pursuit of a sustainable 
future for transport which takes account of people's aspirations 
for access, the crucial economic significance of transport, and 
its wide impact on all aspects of the environment. Important 
among these is air quality. Long term planning and transport 
policies will make a contribution here. But we recognise that in 
the shorter term, over the next few years, transport may also 
need to play a greater part. 
  We are looking urgently at the scope for further tightening 
of vehicle emission limits from around the year 2000, to build 
on the measures already taken and the stringent limits to be 
introduced after l996. We also recognise the need for further 
action on smoky vehicles, where there may be scope for better 
targeting of resources to deal with this particularly visible 
problem. These can all play a part in developing the effective 
management of air quality. We believe that it is also time to 
get a better understanding of the effect that local traffic 
measures have on air quality so that those effects can be better 
taken into account, and the potential role of such schemes in 
improving air quality can be explored. I know that some local 
authorities are already beginning to explore these issues 
themselves. With progress on these fronts, I do not see a need 
for substantial traffic bans in our urban areas. We do not face 
problems on the scale of Athens and Rome. Nor is it clear that 
there is a need here to take the powers, taken for example in 
Germany, to restrict movement by vehicles without catalysts 
during pollution episodes, although that is something we should 
keep under review. 
  What is clear is that we must take sensible and practical 
steps in relation to vehicle regulation and management to 
protect air quality, so that we can avoid the need for more 
draconian measures which could significantly inhibit personal 
mobility and economic activity in our urban areas.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Schoon, environment correspondent: "UK </F>
Bows to Ban on Dumping N-Waste at Sea"] 
  [Text] The government has bowed to international pressure 
and promised not to dump nuclear waste at sea, Gillian Shephard, 
Minister of Agriculture, said yesterday. 
  Britain had wanted the option of dumping the Royal Navy's 
decommissioned nuclear submarines on the sea bed. There are 
already six out-of-action vessels, and by the end of the century 
a further 11 are expected to be taken out of service. 
  But with three days to run before a treaty deadline expires, 
Mrs Shephard said that the UK would accept a formal ban under 
the London Convention. When 45 countries met in London last 
November a large majority voted for the ban, but Britain, 
France, Belgium, China and Russia reserved the right to file an 
objection by 21 February and ignore it. Belgium and France have 
since sided with the ban. 
  In a written answer to Labour's environment spokesman, Chris 
Smith, Mrs Shephard said Britain had not dumped any radioactive 
waste from ships since 1983. The UK was already committed to a 
moratorium on sea dumping until 2008 under a different treaty. 
  "The scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea, carried 
out under controlled conditions, causes no harm to the marine 
environment and poses no threat to human health," she said. 
"This has been confirmed by careful monitoring over many years 
and studies have shown it to be the best practicable 
environmental option for the disposal of certain types of 
radioactive waste". 
  "Nevertheless, the UK recognises that the weight of 
international opinion on this matter means that such dumping is 
not, in any event, a practical proposition. We have, therefore, 
decided to accept the ban," the minister added. 
  Mrs Shephard pointed out that there would be a scientific 
re- 
evaluation of the ban in 25 years. "The UK will be ready to 
reopen discussions in the Convention at any time, should the 
weight of opinion change in favour of accepting the scientific 
conclusions." 
  Bridget Woodman, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: "It's a bit 
of good news. But if they can bow to international pressure on 
radioactive waste dumping, why can't they respond to all the 
international concern about the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant 
and stop it from opening?"

<F P=106> [``CD News'' report: ``Rural Firms to Blame for Nation's </F>
Polluation''] 
  [Text] Township industries are seriously polluting the air 
and water in Tianjin, Shanghai and Beijing, according to the 
National Environmental Protection Agency. 
  Rural enterprises are also pumping out massive amounts of 
industrial waste water and sulphur dioxide fumes in the 
provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Sichuan 
and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. 
  The agency's nationwide survey of the environmental hazards 
caused by township enterprises is the first of its kind. 
  The aim is to help central and local governments improve 
pollution control by identifying the worst offenders. 
  The discharge of industrial waste water around the three 
major cities and in the worst hit provinces accounted for almost 
60 percent of the China's total township water pollution, 
according to the agency. 
  Places facing grave air pollution problems are listed as 
Shanghai Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Beijing, Shanxi, Tianjin, 
Zhejiang and Sichuan. 
  The rural industries in these areas produced 57.2 percent of 
the pollutants piped into the air by rural firms around the 
country. 
  These areas were also to blame for 60 percent of 
township-produced sulphur dioxide, 63 percent of the smoke and 
55.8 percent of the industrial dust of the country's total, 
according to the agency's investigation. The survey, which was 
started in 1989, covered 570,000 enterprises in almost every 
county in the country. Only the Tibetan Autonomous Region and 
Taiwan were left out. 
  Fourteen types of factories were named as major polluters. 
  They included industries involved in asbestos, coke, cement, 
chemicals, paper-making, leather processing, dyeing and brewing. 
  Many of the small industries had out-of-date production 
technology and a high rate of waste discharge. 
  To date less than one-fifth of rural industry reaches State 
standards for waste water disposal. 
  The investigation also revealed that for every five rural 
firms there was only one environmental protection officer. 
  This clearly showed that factory managers in these areas 
still cared little about their environment says the survey. 
  Industrial waste and gas were found to be the major causes 
of 
rural pollution. 
  The Farmers' Daily [NONGMIN RIBAO] has said that 
pollution-control technologies must be introduced into rural 
enterprises and the construction of dirty factories and mills 
must be limited. The best way of controlling pollution is to 
adopt advanced waste disposal technology, according to the 
newspaper.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Efficiency Helps Cut Pollution''] </F>
  [Text] To prevent environmental degradation while still 
striving for economic growth, China should raise industrial 
efficiency and reform industrial structures, said Qu Geping, the 
country's top environmental legislator. 
  Heavy financial input and raw material consumption have 
helped maintain China's high economic growth as well as giving 
rise to heavy pollution, said Qu, head of the Environment 
Committee of the National People's Congress, in Environment 
Protection [HUANJING BAOHU] magazine. 
  Despite significant progress, China's industrial efficiency 
in recent years still lags behind that of developed countries. 
  To produce the same amount of industrial products, China 
uses 
five to 10 times more water than developed nations, Qu said. 
  Authorities have not fully recognized the importance of 
environmental protection in drafting economic plans. 
  Priority has been given to increasing the input of raw 
materials and energy, while encouraging low energy consumption 
and low pollution has been largely ignored. 
  China can no longer afford this model, Qu said. 
  First, resource reserves are limited. China's per capita 
water availability is only a quarter of the world average; per 
capita land area is only one-third of the global level; and per 
capita mineral resources only account for half the world average. 
  With population growth and economic development, the 
shortage 
of resources will only become more acute. 
  If measures are not taken to raise efficiency, production 
costs will rise and industrial development will be handicapped, 
Qu said. 
  The environment has become an important concern in the 
world. 
Pollution control and environmental protection regulations have 
been included in many international trade laws, with possible 
sanctions against nations with poor environmental performances. 
  And China, increasingly dependent upon foreign trade, must 
abide by international laws. 
  Qu suggested that China speed up its industrial, structural 
reshuffle and technological renovation to reduce pollution. 
  One method would be to increase the number of nonpolluting 
industries, such as the service sector. 
  Another method would be to reduce the consumption of energy 
and raw materials. Pollutants should be recycled, treated or 
stored to create a more efficient consumption. 
  Qu also called for increased government funding to fight 
pollution because environmental protection has become very 
costly. 
  The government should try to allocate 1 to 1.5 percent of 
its 
GNP to protecting the environment. Presently the figure is only 
0.7 percent. 
  And environmental investment is very profitable. For every 
100 yuan of investment, 600 yuan of profit could be generated. 
  The State might not be able to afford the increased 
expenditures, Qu said, but spending cuts should come from other 
portions of the budget to finance environmental protection. 
  More money earmarked for industrial projects should be given 
to environmental protection. The government should demand that 
8 to 10 percent of new industrial investment go to environmental 
protection, instead of the present 4.5 percent. 
  The government can also raise standards for pollutant 
discharge, Qu said, adding that low standards partly explain why 
many businesses are not eager to fight pollution. 
  The government needs to adjust financial policies to make it 
easier for the environmental protection projects to get bank 
loans.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 18 (XINHUA) -- Beginning Sunday, China 
will ban dumping of all kinds of radioactive wastes and disposal 
of industrial waste and incineration of industrial waste and 
sewage sludge in its sea waters, a Chinese official said here 
today. 
  According to Yang Wenhe, deputy-director of the State Bureau 
of Oceanography, the Chinese Government has accepted the terms 
of three international resolutions concerning disposal at sea of 
radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter and the phasing 
out of sea disposal of industrial waste and incineration at sea. 
  The resolutions were approved by member nations of the 
convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping 
wastes and other matter in London last November and will take 
effect on 20 February 1994. 
  ``The approval and implementation of the three resolutions 
means a stricter global control of dumping of wastes at sea,'' 
Yang told XINHUA. 
  ``China will strictly comply with the resolutions and 
implement them in letter and spirit,'' he said. 
  ``China will ban the dumping of waste matters which do not 
conform to the standards set by the resolutions,'' he added. 
``disposing of wastes without license or dumping irresponsibly 
at sea will be punished severely according to law.'' 
  With special permission, disposal of low-level radioactive 
waste at sea is allowed, according to China's present ``rules of 
controlling dumping at sea.'' Controlled low-level toxic or 
nontoxic industrial waste is also allowed to be dumped at sea 
with permission. But incineration at sea has never taken place 
in China. 
  ``China will make necessary revisions of the rules and 
regulations concerned,'' Yang said. 
  According to the Chinese official, the dumping of wastes at 
sea has been under strict management and control in China, 
according to a system which includes application, examination, 
approval and issuing of permits. 
  The State Council has approved 38 dumping regions in China's 
sea waters. The major dumping material has been castoff from 
dredging, according to Yang. 
  ``In recent years, no pollution accidents caused by dumping 
of waste in Chinese seas have occurred. Close monitoring also 
indicates that the water quality around the dumping regions 
remains fine,'' he said.

  [Text] Shenyang, Feb 21 (XINHUA) -- Sulphur dioxide in the 
air of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, 
will be reduced to two-thirds the current content in 1996. 
  This is the predicted outcome of a facilities upgrading 
project in the Shenyang Smeltery, which emits up to 40 percent 
of the city's sulphur dioxide. 
  The project, scheduled to be completed in 1996, will slash 
sulphur dioxide emissions from the smeltery by 80 percent. 
Density of emissions will be far below limits set by the state. 
  The project recently received a loan of 5.89 million U.S. 
dollars from the Canadian Government through the Shenyang branch 
of the Bank of Communications. 
  The pollutant is mainly discharged by the smeltery's 
out-of-date purifying equipment, used in the preparation of 
sulphuric acid. 
  In 1994, this industrial city is reportedly to improve 70 
percent of its combustion and dust removing installments to meet 
state requirements.

  [Text] The Burmese Government has given Thai timber 
merchants until next month to haul 4,777 fallen logs out of 
Burma before it closes its forests, a source says. 
  The source said that 47 Thai timber merchants have 
concessions in Burma but the Rangoon government decided last 
December to end them in a bid to save natural resources. 
  The Thais have been hauling logs out but some fallen logs 
remain in the concession areas and it may not be possible to 
remove them by the deadline. 
  The source added that Thai timber concession holders have 
submitted their proposals to remove the fallen logs, but the 
Burmese government is still considering them. 
  Some Thai timber merchants have also submitted proposals to 
take on Burmese partners in setting up sawmills and furniture 
factories in Burma. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry source said that Burma's State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), in consultation with 
several ministries, has outlined the following policies on the 
timber trade: 
  -- The government will extend timber trading until March for 
the fallen 4,777 logs as an exception in the Maw area within the 
Northeastern military command; 
  -- The Forestry Ministry will exclusively carry out timber 
trade. The Forestry Department will report transactions to the 
government for which the forestry ministry will draw up a yearly 
reverse sales plan, decreasing sales by 50 percent, 25 percent 
and 10 percent respectively; 
  -- The Forestry Ministry will also oversee all timber 
production within Burma, shutting out local and foreign private 
enterprises; 
  -- Internal timber trading and will be done on tender basis 
[sentence as published]; 
  -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will not be allowed 
to export timber but will be allowed to process and export wood 
products; 
  -- People holding stakes in joint ventures will also be able 
to buy timber under a tender system based on current prices 
abroad; 
  -- The military will not be allowed to deal in timber 
trading; 
  -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will be encouraged 
to 
produce processed wood for export.

<F P=106> [Second and final part of interview with Forestry Minister </F>
Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindee Lertcharoenchok in 
Rangoon; date not given; question printed in boldface] 
  [Text] 
  Lertcharoenchok: How could you continue to have 
nearly 50 percent forestry cover when you gave out many logging 
concessions to Thai companies since late 1988 and only ended 
them late last year. The figure you gave does not seem to 
correspond to reality taking into account of the vast amount or 
volume of wood that have been extracted from those concessioned 
areas? 
  Chit Swe: The whole forest cover area involved in 
the border concessions is only 2.6 percent of our total forest 
area and besides, these forest have been more or less untouched 
in the past. We gave concessions of 200,000 hoppus tons only. 
We gave some concessions for four to five years to Thai 
companies. Up to now a little more than 150,000 hoppus tons a 
year were extracted during the peak years. When we started the 
concession, the average extraction was 150,000 hoppus tons a 
year along the whole stretch of the border. However since 1992 
it was taken off, because all the concessions started to expire 
and we did not renew them. 
  Now I have to see Thai friends everyday, at least one or 
two. 
They have got heavy commitments with foreign companies to get 
the raw material in time. It is very important for them. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Now that these logging 
concessions are gone, what are you going to do? 
  Chit Swe: I have never said that logging 
concessions have gone. In concessioned areas we can do 
something for mutual benefit. We can harvest from those areas 
with our local people, but foreigners are not allowed to get 
concessions. 
  That is why some people are asking if insurgents coming out 
to legal fold, would they be entitled to the concessions. For 
this, we need time to consider. 
  For the Burman it is not easy for them to stay in that area, 
only the nationalities (ethnic minorities) stay there. To enter 
into the forestry related businesses, all interested local 
parties would have to deal with the central government or enter 
into joint ventures with foreign partners: If the area is 100 
percent secure and our forest people can go in to check every 
tree, then we can consider which kind of business is suitable 
for that area. We have to consider that on a case by case basis. 
  Lertcharoenchok: So it means that even though 
foreign logging concessions have gone, the local people still 
have the chance to obtain them? 
  Chit Swe: Yes. However, it is not easy to export 
logs to other countries. Preference is given to value-added 
industries. I cannot for certain say what kind of business is 
good. But in general there is plenty of raw material there and 
one can enter into whatever forestry-related business. In some 
areas we can set up pulp and paper factories. Because of 
certain tree species, some areas are good for veneer and plywood 
industries. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Now that all logging concessions 
to Thai companies have gone. [sentence as published] Would you 
please say what experiences and problems you have learned from 
giving out timber concessions to Thai companies? 
  Chit Swe: Before I gave out concessions, my 
knowledge about forestry was like that of a primary student. 
Now after five years experience, I can say I have a PhD. We 
used to receive messages sent to us everyday from local 
commanders saying they seized 3,000 (illegally felled) logs here 
or 2,000 trees there, and some pointed to me saying: ``Since you 
are the Forestry Minister, you are responsible for it. But I 
said it came under the jurisdiction of the police and hence not 
under my office.'' In Burmese we have a saying: ``If you make it 
easier even for a very rich man, he still becomes a thief.'' It 
is not easy to conduct checks because we are far away from the 
forested areas. Because of this even a rich man can become a 
poacher. That is why in some areas we give concessions to them 
and at the same time put up border checkpoints. Anyhow they 
still take logs from some other areas. So in many areas there 
are many problems. 
  Lertcharoenchok: So the main problems you face 
stem from illegal cuttings? 
  Chit Swe: Yes. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Even by concession companies? 
  Chit Swe: Some companies are very good. They do 
their job systematically. But others however they have 
sub-contracts and the sub-contractors further sub-contract them. 
There are no checkpoints, no border police and no forest guards. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Roughly how many companies 
received your concessions and how many are good companies? 
  Chit Swe: Only one third of the companies behave 
well. We gave out about 42 concessions to 34 companies. Mostly 
of them were not original timber business people and that is the 
root cause of the problems. Of those, who tried to get 
concessions, I think only 10 percent were real timber men. More 
than 90 percent were not. 
  Lertcharoenchok: What are the real reasons for you 
to stop border logging concessions? Is it because of illegal 
logging or are you environmentally conscious? 
  Chit Swe: When we decided, it is not because of 
illegal logging. It is secondary. The first is because of the 
watershed. Our watershed is your watershed. For instance, the 
Tenasserim Mountain is a large range and is also the watershed 
of Thailand. There are also some other very high mountains in 
the Tenasserim-Division. From our side it is not easy to 
extract logs because of the high mountains. So if logs are cut 
on our side there will be drought and flooding in your country 
100. Also, people from developed countries are putting pressure. 
  Up to now there are no big problems with the environmental 
people, but anyhow we must be very careful, because if the 
population become bigger, forest cover will become lesser and 
lesser. 
  The logging concessions are not only on the border areas but 
also deeper inside the country too. Our concern is that foreign 
partners would become richer and richer, but local partners 
would have no change in status. Because of this we want to 
encourage local people. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Thailand has plans to develop 
several hydropower dams along the Thai-Burmese border such as 
the over 6,000 Megawatt Salween Dam, and many envirommentalists 
are concerned that those projects will have negative impacts on 
your natural resources, mainly the forests. What is your 
opinion? 
  Chit Swe: Now they are discussing natural gas to 
Thailand through Kanchanaburi Province. The project does not 
affect a big area--only a small area for the gas pipeline and 
only some roads. I think there is no problem. 
  As for the Salween Dam, I think it is a very big project. It 
has to go phase by phase. You should ask the Energy Minister. 
He may be able give you some ideas. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Which country is the biggest 
investor in your forestry industry and the biggest log buyer? 
  Chit Swe: I think Thai companies. When it is not 
easy to get logs from the border, they come here. Thai people 
have very good experience in the timber business. They buy from 
our country, logs as well as other forestry products. 
  The Japanese are usually the highest bidders. They buy the 
best quality teak and other hardwood. However, they usually 
sell it later, especially hardwood, to the Taiwanese. There is 
a case when a Japanese company bid highest in one tender for 
some logs. We thought it was going to Japan, but it turned out 
that the company sold the logs here to a Taiwanese company. 
When I met the Taiwanese gentleman and asked him if he was 
going to take the logs to Taiwan he said he was going to sell 
the logs to China. So it is just changing hands causing the 
value to go higher and higher. Because of this, we are trying 
to sell directly to the real buyers. 
  Lertcharoenchok: Is China one of your biggest 
timber buyers? 
  Chit Swe: No. It is Japan. The West also buys 
quality teak. Fourth quality teak is bought mainly by the 
Indians. They have got a very good market with the Middle East, 
which we don't. Because of this we go through the Indians as 
third party.

  [Text] Osaka, Feb 5 KYODO -- Osaka Prefecture will install 
a newly developed technology that reduces ozone-depleting 
nitrooxides and other car exhaust fumes at a major road to test 
the system over a three-year period, officials said Saturday [5 
February]. 
  An electric fan will suck in polluted air from the road 
level 
through a two- to three-meter-wide vent, which leads the air 
about one meter underground. 
  Once there, the air passes through four layers of so-called 
``geotextile,'' a filter-like fabric that absorbs the 
cancer-causing diesel exhaust particles (dep). 
  Earth bacteria will deplete the remaining nitrooxides into 
harmless nitrogen and oxygen, both air components, when the air 
penetrates through the soil on its way back to the surface. 
  The prefecture has earmarked 40 million yen for the pilot 
project in its budget for fiscal 1994, which starts 1 April. 
The system will be set up at a road with a traffic volume of 
more than 20,000 vehicles per day, the officials said. 
  Despite some success in reducing greenhouse gases, including 
nitrooxides, thanks to the broad use of catalyzer cars, eight of 
105 survey stations in Osaka have said they will not be able to 
reach nitrodioxide targets of below 0.06 ppm (parts per million) 
by the turn of the century.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 1 KYODO -- Japan and Russia have 
abandoned the use of a chemical tanker for the storage of liquid 
radioactive waste that might otherwise be dumped by the Russian 
Navy into the sea, government officials said Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  The officials said the idea was dropped after it was 
discovered that the used chemical tanker under consideration 
might not be able to withstand the severe cold of the Russian 
Far East. 
  They said the two sides have subsequently begun considering 
the idea of Japan providing financial assistance for emergency 
disposal facilities. 
  Russia asked Japan in talks last December to help find a 
chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 5,000 tons 
and 25,000 tons. Japan had introduced a 10,000-ton class 
Panamanian-registered tanker docked in Singapore. 
  But Russian inspectors determined that the tanker might not 
be able to withstand severe cold weather conditions and that its 
deck may not be thick enough to prevent adverse effects on the 
environment and on the health of the crew. 
  A $100 million fund pledged by Tokyo to Moscow to help it 
scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons is expected to be utilized 
toward the alternative facilities. 
  Russia last dumped 900 tons of low-level radioactive waste 
into the Sea of Japan on 17 October. It suspended a planned 
second dumping following international protests, particularly 
from Japan and South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 2 KYODO -- A government advisory panel on 
Wednesday [2 February] proposed a package of measures to 
accelerate the phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals. 
  The recommendations focus on bringing forward planned 
production cutbacks of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other 
solvents that destroy the Earth's ozone layer and expanding the 
scope of materials subject to output restrictions. 
  They are contained in an interim report by the chemical 
product council, an advisory body to the trade minister. 
  The package is in response to a provision in the revised 
Montreal Protocol, which calls for complete abolition of five 
types of CFCs by the end of 1995, instead of 2000 as recommended 
originally. 
  The protocol, revised in November 1992, also called for 
total 
cessation of halon production by the end of last year and of 
trichloroethane manufacture by the end of 1995. 
  The panel also recommended establishing a legal framework to 
ensure adequate control and management of CFC production and 
curbing discharge of ozone-depleting materials. 
  Item-by-item output, however, should not be restricted 
because such a step would run counter to the market mechanism, 
it said. 
  The interim report called for efforts by the government and 
the private sector to promote effective recycling of CFCs.

Thursday [17 February] an International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
working group will discuss a French proposal to create a whale 
sanctuary in Antarctic waters at its meeting on 20-24 February 
in Norfork Island, Australia. 
  The last IWC conference, held in Kyoto last May, decided to 
set up a working group to deal with the controversial proposal 
which sharply divided anti-and pro-whaling nations. 
  Agency officials said the Norfolk Island meeting will be 
attended by representatives from 27 members of the 40-country 
commission, including Kazuo Shima, the agency's deputy director 
general. 
  They said the results of discussions there will be reported 
at the next IWC meeting in Mexico on 23-27 May.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 17 KYODO -- An international forum of 
environment experts called Thursday [17 February] for greater 
fostering of expertise in the preservation of biological 
diversity in the Asian region. 
  The Tokyo Workshop on Cooperation for the Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Asia brought together about 70 people, 
representing the World Bank, the United Nations Environment 
Program, the governments of Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the 
Philippines, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). 
  In a closing statement to the gathering, the workshop 
president, Taishichiro Sato of the Japan Wildlife Research 
Center, said the participants had decided to promote the 
development of knowledge and specialized technology for the 
preservation of biodiversity in Asia. 
  Sato said they also expressed a desire to encourage more 
local bodies to participate in biodiversity conservation and to 
encourage more efficient data collection and sharing so that 
development decisions can be made without compromising the 
region's biodiversity. 
  The gathering was organized by the Environment Agency of 
Japan and the Japan Wildlife Research Center. 
  Colin Rees, head of the Land, Water and Natural Habitats 
Department within the World Bank, said the technology to ensure 
biodiversity is maintained is still inadequate. 
  Rees called on Japan to foster more people able to preserve 
biodiversity in its other agencies and ministries and not just 
within the Environment Agency. 
  Representatives from the Foreign Ministry, Japan 
International Cooperation Agency and the Japan branch of the 
World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 22 KYODO -- The average amount of 
nonindustrial waste per capita in Japan decreased marginally in 
fiscal 1991 for the first time in eight years in what the Health 
and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday [22 February] could be the 
start of a new trend. 
  The ministry said the average person threw out 1,118 grams 
of 
garbage per day during the year, two grams per day less than in 
the previous year. 
  The 1991 fiscal year ran from 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992. 
  The ministry said that although the economy was still 
booming 
at the time, the very slight decrease may represent the 
beginning of a change in consumption habits with more people 
becoming aware of the need to create less garbage. 
  But despite the decline in the per person average, the 
overall amount of nonindustrial garbage actually increased. 
  Nonindustrial garbage thrown out during the year weighed a 
record of about 50.77 million tons. This was some 0.6 percent 
more than the previous year. 
  The cost of disposing of the garbage, including collection, 
transport and disposal, amounted to 1,998.6 billion yen, an 
increase of about 14 percent over the previous year. 
  It was the 10th consecutive increase in the annual cost of 
dealing with the nation's garbage. 
  The cost per person was about 12,800 yen, up from 11,200 yen 
the previous year. 
  About 17 percent of the garbage was buried in landfill and 
about 73 percent was incinerated. 
  Data on industrial waste is released separately, but in 
fiscal 1990, industrial waste amounted to about eight times the 
weight of nonindustrial waste.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 22 KYODO -- An Environment Agency 
affiliate will give a total 405 million yen of subsidies in 
fiscal 1994 to 104 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) which 
are helping promote preservation of the global environment, 
officials said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  But civic groups are critical of the inclusion of an 
industry 
association -- the Japan Industrial Conference for Ozone Layer 
Protection, a group set up by automakers and electrical 
appliance manufacturers -- as a recipient of the subsidies. 
  Among the recipents are 23 NGOs which will receive such 
subsidies for the first time from the Japan Environment Corp. 
  The amount of subsidies to the 23 organizations will total 
112 million yen, the officials said. 
  The subsidies will be disbursed out of a 2 billion yen fund 
set up with joint financing from the government and public 
gambling proceeds, the officials said. 
  Projects covered by the subsidies will include one for 
planting seedlings of a mangrove whose existence in the 
Philippines is threatened by industrial pollution, they said. 
  A spokesman for the Consumers Union of Japan said, ``it is 
outrageous for the JEC to help finance the activities of the 
industry association. They should uphold the principle of 
having polluters pay for the cost of environmental 
preservation.'' 
  An official of another civic group, the Peoples' Forum 2001, 
Japan, said, ``government ministries in positions to supervise 
business corporations and their industry bodies should not link 
up with those business organizations. Rather, they should focus 
their assistance on the NGOs led by citizens.''

  [Text] Seoul, Feb 7 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korean 
delegates will attend two international conferences on the 
environment in Northeast Asia this year, a Foreign Ministry 
official said on Monday. 
  A senior working-level meeting on the environment will be 
held in Beijing in April, with delegates from South and North 
Korea, China, Japan, Russia and Mongolia scheduled to attend. 
  Three or four delegates of the director-general level from 
the Foreign and Environment Ministries will attend the Beijing 
meeting and exchange views on energy and air pollution, 
management of the ecosystem, training of personnel and 
information exchanges. 
  Following the Beijing meeting, the first inter-governmental 
conference under the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) is 
slated for Seoul in June or July, when South and North Korean, 
Chinese, Japanese and Russian delegates will discuss 
environmental protection in the Yellow and East Seas. 
  The five countries held three rounds of preparatory talks 
for 
the Seoul meeting last year. The meeting is planned because the 
waters around the Korean peninsula were selected as one of 12 
areas by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) where the 
possibility of pollution is very high. 
  ``Northeast Asian countries have formed a consultative body 
on the environment, the first time they have set up such a body 
on a specific issue. Moreover, it is significant that both 
Seoul and Pyongyang are to attend the two environment 
conferences,'' the Foreign Ministry official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb 1 (YONHAP) -- The Coalition for 
Environment Protection Movement formed a committee to work out 
measures in preparation for the Green Round multilateral 
negotiations on Tuesday. 
  The committee is aimed at activating environmental 
protection 
steps in all aspects of society on a civilian level. 
  A ceremony observing the formation of the committee was held 
at the Press Center, central Seoul, Tuesday afternoon and the 
president of Songgyunkwan University, Chang Ul-pyong, was 
elected chairman of the panel. 
  ``We, as a civilian-level committee, plan to cope with the 
Green Round negotiations, which may serve as the largest trade 
barrier to South Korea after the Uruguay Round talks,'' the 
committee said. 
  The committee plans to work out a comprehensive 
environmental 
protection plan and present it to the government, cooperate with 
foreign environmental organizations, and attend a civilian-level 
environment congress in Manchester, England, in June. 
  Nearly 40 environmental scholars are participating in the 
committee, which will study the process of negotiations in 
specific areas under the Green Round talks.

  [Text] The U.S. military bases in Korea are posing serious 
environmental threat to their host country, an opposition 
lawmaker insisted yesterday. 
  Rep. Yi Pok-chin of the Democratic Party told the Assembly 
interpellation session that much of the sewage from the U.S. 
military facilities here has been flowing into their neighboring 
rivers without undergoing proper treatment. 
  Rep. Yim cited a Seoul government report in March last year 
that about 1,600 tons of 5,000 tons of untreated waste water 
from the U.S. Air Force K-55 base in Songtan, Kyonggi Province, 
was streaming into nearby rivers every day. 
  ``According to a state-run environmental research lab, the 
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the areas surrounding the 
K-55 base turned out to be 122 ppm [parts per million], much 
higher than the internationally permissible level of 60 ppm, 
last August,'' the lawmaker said. 
  ``Through the water and environmental pollution around the 
U.S. bases has been growing more serious, the Seoul government 
has been barred by the U.S.-Korean bilateral treaty, SOFA, from 
cracking down on the contamination,'' Yim insisted. 
  Rep. Yim, who retired as an Army major-general in 1991, also 
charged that about 1,000 tons of the nonconductor PCB 
(polychlorinated biphenyl), which is widely known as 
cancer-causing materials, have been discarded around U.S. radar 
bases in Korea. 
  ``I have been told that the U.S. authorities have ignored 
the 
Seoul government's repeated order to stop their environmental 
misconduct,'' he said. 
  Yim then asked whether it is true that the U.S. Forces have 
once asked the Korean Government to finance their purification 
facilities. 
  Meanwhile, a ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] lawmaker 
insisted during the same parliamentary interpellation session 
that the U.S. Forces have operated commercial facilities inside 
their bases against the SOFA regulations. 
  ``The ten-story Dragon Hill hotel located in the U.S. 
Yongsan 
base has been used for business purposes rather than being used 
by servicemen. It is an obvious violation of the SOFA,'' said 
Rep. Kwak Yong-tal of the DLP. 
  Rep. Kwak, a former Air Force lieutenant-general, also asked 
whether the government is willing to take over the ownership of 
the Seoul House in downtown Seoul from the U.S. military, saying 
that the American facility has rarely been used by U.S. military 
personnel.

  [Text] Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Angel C. 
Alcala said the coastal environment has become a critical and 
often dominant ecological presupposition of economics, social, 
and cultural life as he launched the 9th coastal environment 
program (CEP) impact site in Telbang, Alaminos, Pangasinan. 
  CEP has a P90 million [Philippine pesos] funding for 1994, 
and P5 million has been allocated to the Region 1 CEP. 
  The launching was copped by a giant clam seeding activity 
led 
by Alcala and Alaminos local officials, and assisted by the 
University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute. 
  The program was earlier launched in eight impact sites in 
Palaui Island, Sta. [Santa or Holy] Ana, Cagayan; Palauig, 
Masinloc, Zambales; Ulugan Bay, Palawan; Prieto Diaz, Sorsogon; 
Taclong Island, Guimaras, Ilo-ilo; Mahanay Island, Bohol; Guian, 
Samar; and, Murcielagos Bay, Misamis Occidental. 
  Alcala said this program curse the disproportionate focus of 
DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources] programs 
on the upland ecosystems. [as published] 
  The program embraces the coastal communities and fisheries 
pertaining to their productivity, biodiversity, integrity, 
sustainability, and equitability of access and use. 
  It mobilizes stakeholders and local communities in the 
protection, conservation, and management of their coastal areas 
on sustainable basis.

  [Text] The Karen are Thailand's ecological conscience. 
  And if Thailand's ambitious plans to build dams on border 
rivers are seen through, the Karen could soon weigh heavily on 
Thailand's humanitarian conscience. 
  Living among the river valleys on the border between 
Thailand 
and Burma, they -- like the Penans in Malaysia -- depend on 
having a healthy forest to maintain their way of life. They 
have suffered heavily from the intensive logging carried out by 
Thai firms in Burmese forests. 
  Unlike the Penan, of course, the Karen having been fighting 
a 
war of self-determination against Burma's military regime for 
the last 40 years. This has placed them in a vulnerable 
position vis-a-vis Thailand, a fact which the government has 
exploited to demand timber concessions. 
  In need of arms and Thailand's favour, the Karen have been 
forced to accept the logging. But now Thailand wants to 
construct dams on their territory. 
  Out of its entire winding course from the Tibetan Plateau 
down to the Gulf of Martaban, the Salween River only touches the 
Thai border for roughly 100 kilometres. Less than six percent 
of the river's catchment area lies within Thailand. Yet the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) is planning 
to build two major dams on this major river. 
  The biggest, the Upper Salween Dam, will be located 76 kms 
upstream from the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers. 
The 166-metre high dam would probably flood more than 1,000 
square kms of land, almost entirely in Karenni and Shan States 
in Burma. 
  But the electricity and the water would go to Thailand. 
  The dam would have an installed electricity generating 
capacity of 4,540 megawatts, nearly five times more than 
Thailand's largest dam making it possibly the biggest dam in 
Southeast Asia (Malaysia is planning a 16,000-MW dam in Sarawak 
State). 
  Thailand and Burma are planning seven other joint dam 
projects, including the Lower Salween Dam, three on the Moei 
River which divides Thailand from Burma further south, and one 
dam apiece on the Mae Sai, Mae Nam Kok and Klong Kra Buri. 
Plans have been drawn up to pump water from the proposed Moei 
and Salween reservoirs over the mountains and into the severely 
depleted Phumiphon Reservoir. 
  Feasibility studies for seven of these projects have already 
been carried out at the request of the Thai and Burmese 
governments by the secretive, Japan-based Electric Power 
Development Corp, a ``special corporation'' largely funded by 
the Japanese government and closely connected to Japan's 
overseas development aid institutions. 
  The Upper and Lower Salween Dams are expected to cost around 
Bt100 million. With the World Bank turning away from other 
large-scale hydro projects such as the Narmada in India, it's 
not at all clear where the money will come from. 
  More to the point, it's not at all clear where the Karen 
living along the Salween and Moei River valleys are going to go. 
The dams will destroy not only their homes but their way of 
life, turning them into refugees. 
  The Karen will be forced into making a terrible choice, 
between living in Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration 
Council] concentration camps or Thai refugee camps. Under 
outside pressure, the Thai government has quietly tolerated the 
presence of Karen refugees, but always with reluctance and 
irritation. 
  If a military force were to move in and kick the Karen off 
their land at gunpoint, it would be condemned as naked 
aggression. So why should flooding them off their land be 
judged any differently? Thailand seems to be embarking on dam 
warfare, a serious matter since the people to be displaced are 
well-armed. 
  The Karen are also well aware that electricity for Thailand 
means power for Slorc, the military junta now ruling Burma. 
``Thailand will get the energy, Slorc will get the money, and 
we will be left to deal with the impacts of the dam,'' one Karen 
leader has noted. 
  Nor is the international community likely to accept this 
matter lying down. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
has recently recommended by unanimous vote that the Clinton 
administration take a much closer look at the human rights 
situation in Burma. According to the London-based human rights 
organization Amnesty International, a climate fear is still 
prevalent in the country, despite cosmetic changes by the ruling 
military junta. 
  While damming the border rivers may at first glance seem to 
be an easy way to generate cheap electricity and -- by filling 
up the Phumiphon Reservoir -- to show that dams can work as a 
replacement for watershed forests, the hidden costs of these 
schemes are overwhelmingly large. 
  Dams have long been decried as a crime against nature. These 
projects on the border rivers, however, are also a crime against 
the Karen. And since they are to be imposed on a minority 
people for the benefit of a foreign power, they are nothing less 
than a crime against humanity.

  [Text] The Pattani River has been found to be highly 
contaminated by such toxic heavy metals as cadmium and arsenic, 
which come from mining activities in Yala Province. 
  Research conducted by a team of lecturers at the Prince of 
Songkla University since 1992 has indicated that the amount of 
such dangerous substances is higher than the acceptable 
standards set by the World Health Organisation. This is 
especially so for arsenic which was recorded at 0.13 
milligrammes per litre against the standard of 0.05 mg/l. 
  The amount of cadmium in the river was measured at 0.04 
milligrammes per litre against 0.01 mg/l while lead 
contaminatlon was found at 0.02 mg/l. 
  The contamination is believed to be caused by mining 
activities at the Thalu Cave area in Yala's Bannang Sata 
District as miners dumped a huge amount of contaminated earth 
and sand into natural waterways. 
  Prof. Dr. Prawet Wasi, president of the National 
Sub-committee on Epidemiology, provided more funds to the team 
of researchers, led by Prince of Songkla Engineering Rector 
Suraphon Arikun. 
  Arsenic from tin-mining has long been the cause of a disease 
in Ron Phibun District in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

  [Excerpt] Amon Antachai, governor of Chanthaburi Province, 
disclosed that the Interior Ministry on 4 February issued an 
order instructing provincial administrations along the border 
with Cambodia to open for 24 hours per day temporary crossing 
points for Thai logging companies to transport timber left 
stranded in Cambodia. The opening of the crossing points will 
last until 31 March. 
  The Cambodian Government earlier announced a relaxation of 
the timber export ban for Thai loggers to transport their timber 
to Thailand before the 31 March deadline. 
  The temporary opening of the border crossing points by the 
Interior Ministry is a great relief for Thai loggers because 
their timber has been inside Cambodia since 31 December 1992 
when the Thai Government ordered the closure of the crossing 
points in compliance with UN resolutions. Some 100,000 to 
200,000 cubic meters of timber worth several hundred million 
baht of Thai logging companies will be sent across the border to 
Thailand. Before the general election and formation of the 
Cambodian coalition government, the Thai logging companies were 
lobbying with the then Cambodian regime for permission to ship 
their timber out of the country to no avail. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged people 
from all walks of life to join the Government's project to 
reafforest over five million rai of land. 
  The project is in commemoration of the 50th anniversary in 
1996 of the reign of His Majesty the King. 
  The premier made the call at a meeting at Government House 
to 
unveil the project attended by some 500 provincial governors, 
representatives of provincial chambers of commerce, businessmen 
and ministerial officials. 
  Mr. Chuan said Their Majesties the King and Queen have been 
devotees of forest conservation and reafforestation. 
  In 1996 His Majesty the King will have been on the throne 
for 
50 years, the longest reign in the kingdom and currently in the 
world. 
  The Government will seize this great opportunity. All Thais 
will celebrate the event through the reafforestation project in 
honour of His Majesty the King, he said. 
  Apart from the five million rai of denuded forest land, 
trees 
will be planted at roadsides, temples, schools, government 
offices and residential communities. 
  The project, the biggest of its kind launched by the 
Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry in 30 years of 
reafforestation work, has begun in certain areas and will be 
accelerated so that it is completed in time for the big 
celebrations in 1996. 
  The Government has informed Their Majesties the King and 
Queen about the project. 
  Their Majesties have expressed their royal wish that the 
reafforestation be carried out in uninhabited areas with mixed 
species of tree seedlings, especially indigenous species. 
  The work should be done from the top of the denuded 
mountains 
to the plains and, in the case of serious erosion, vetiver grass 
should be introduced to help hold the topsoil and keep humidity. 
  Their Majesties also said that fog catchers made from cheap 
local materials should be provided at the planted pits to catch 
fog or dew drops to feed the seedlings. 
  The fog catchers would also protect the seedlings from the 
sun and provide water for the seedlings at the same time. 
  The authorities concerned should follow Their Majesties' 
suggestions in carrying out the project, Mr. Chuan said. 
  The Cabinet approved the project last Tuesday and regards it 
as a major task for all ministers. 
  The project calls for the reafforestation of five million 
rai 
over 1,345 degraded forests across the country beginning on 
Coronation Day this year, 5 May, and ending on 5 May 1996. 
  After reafforestation, the project areas will be conserved 
and closed to commercial exploitation, and villagers will not be 
allowed to encroach on the land. 
  Those who joined the reafforestation will not be able to 
claim ownership of the forest. 
  Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, the minister 
responsible for the project, said deteriorating conservation 
forests in national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and watershed 
areas will come under the project. 
  The Government's target is to reafforest 1.35 million rai of 
denuded forest land this year, 1.65 million rai next year and 
another two million rai in 1996. 
  Mr. Suthep said the Forestry Department has prepared 500 
million seedlings so far for the reafforestation this year. 
  He said His Majesty the King pioneered the program with the 
reafforestation of the Chai Phatthana and Mae Fa Luang 
foundations, 500,000 rai of land, for the Thai people. 
  Several private sector companies have joined the program by 
expressing their intention to grow trees on two million rai of 
land nationwide. Oil trading businesses have promised to grow 
trees on about one million rai. 
  Reafforesting one rai will cost about 3,000 baht. The entire 
project will require about 20 billion baht. 
  A new foundation will be set up specifically to handle the 
project on behalf of all interested parties.

water resources management for Thailand to adapt for the future 
use of the Mekong River, according to the Science and Technology 
Ministry's Department of National Energy Administration. 
  ``Australia will share experiences with Thailand of their 
dam 
constructions and management of main rivers in the four states 
-- Queensland, NSW [New South Wales], Victoria and South 
Australia,'' said the press statement. 
  The MoU, inked by department director-general Prathet 
Sutabut 
and New South Wales Water Resources Department director-general 
Peter Millington, would cover long-term bilateral cooperation in 
terms of economics, engineering, science and environmental 
control and development. 
  Australia will also share information on soil condition 
development of NSW state, which used to have a problem with 
salty soil, for prevention and resolution of salty soil problems 
that may arise in Thailand's Kong-Chee-Mool project.

  [Text] The director-general of the Industrial Works 
Department, Manat Suksaman, has given an assurance that 
factories along the Chao Phraya, Bang Pakong, Pa Sak, Tha Chin 
and Nam Pong rivers will not pollute river water during the dry 
season. 
  The department has made a series of inspections as part of a 
five-month campaign beginning in January to monitor factories to 
ensure they do not dump treated or untreated waste water which 
fails to meet standards into public waterways. 
  The factories have been urged to economise on consumption of 
water or to reuse treated water in the factories to help cushion 
the impact of the severe water shortage. 
  The campaign is part of the government's effort to tackle 
the 
drought this year, the worst in 25 years. 
  Mr. Manat said: ``I can assure you that river water will not 
be polluted by factories along either bank of five major rivers 
during the dry season. However, I cannot be sure that the river 
water will not be polluted by communities and farms.'' 
  He said there will be constant inspections during the dry 
season to ensure that the factories do not pollute the river 
water. 
  ``The department has got tough with factories discharging 
waste water into the rivers because the drought this year is the 
worst ever, and a very low volume of water from major dams is 
flowing into the rivers,'' he said. 
  ``Even a little waste water dumped into the rivers can 
easily 
pollute the water.'' 
  Any factory found polluting river water will face severe 
penalties, ranging from warnings and fines to imprisonment, he 
said. 
  Last week Mr. Manat led a group of officials and engineers 
to 
inspect factories near the Bang Pakong river in Chachoengsao, to 
monitor whether the department's campaign was being carried out 
successfully. 
  He said that treated waste water from 33 major factories 
sited on either bank of the Bang Pakong River is being 
discharged into the river in very small amounts. 
  This is because of the limited volume of raw water. Most 
factories are storing the treated water for further reuse, 
especially for factory cleaning and garden watering. In 
addition, the raw water sold in this area is very expensive, as 
high as 100 baht per cubic metre. 
  After they followed the department's advice, factories can 
reduce water consumption by 30 percent compared with the same 
period last year. One million cubic metres worth one million 
baht can be saved, he said. 
  Mr. Manat said the samples of water from the Bang Pakong 
river show average salinity gauged at 24,500 parts per million 
(ppm). Dissolved oxygen is gauged at five milligrammes per litre. 
  This indicates that the river water is too salty and is not 
fit for consumption. The salinity standard of drinking water is 
250 ppm. 
  Mr. Manat said factories sited on the banks of other target 
rivers are also being kept under close watch. 
  Factors contributing to river pollution vary, he said. For 
example, water in the Chao Phraya and Pa Sal rivers is mainly 
polluted by the community rather than by factories, while that 
of the Tha Chin River is the result equally of communities, 
farms and industrial plants 
  The problem of the the Nam Pong is very easy to see, as the 
river is static, and the department will therefore not allow 
factories to dump any waste water there, he said. 
  Phoenix Pulp and Paper Co's mill is a model in that it does 
not discharge treated waste water into the Nam Pong, but instead 
uses it to water its eucalyptus tree plantation, he said. 
  ``With the strict measures applied to factories, I can 
assure 
you that river water will definitely not be polluted by 
factories,'' Mr. Manat said.

``Bulgaria Will Have a Storage Depot for Radioactive Waste From 
Kozloduy''] 
  [Text] Bulgaria has been developing nuclear power for more 
than 20 years now, but has yet to develop a proper position 
regarding the problem of disposing of the radioactive waste from 
nuclear power plants. In the recent past, various state 
institutions have made attempts to overcome this backwardness, 
but despite this we still have no national strategy backed up by 
legislation and no specialized organization for controlling 
radioactive waste. Meanwhile, the waste is accumulating at the 
Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, and the amounts of low- and 
medium-level waste already exceed 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes. In 
recent years high-level waste nuclear fuel has been added to 
these deposits. Debates have been going on in the press as to 
whether this high- level waste should be stored at Kozloduy for 
40-50 years or whether it should be sent abroad for reprocessing 
in return for payment. In either case, the high-level waste 
produced after the fuel has been treated will most likely be 
buried in Bulgaria, for which we will need a deep underground 
storage site. 
  In 1991, the Council of Ministers asked the Bulgarian 
Academy 
of Sciences to develop a concept for a national radioactive 
waste storage depot. A large team of experts was formed from 
seven Academy of Sciences institutes, who were joined by 
specialists from Sofia University, the University of Mining and 
Geology, the Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources, the 
Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and other 
departments. 
  The end result of the study showed that sites do exist in 
Bulgaria that are suitable for constructing stores close to the 
surface for low- and medium-level waste with a comparatively 
short life, which, after treatment and packing in special 
containers, does not present any particular danger to the 
surrounding environment. As far as high-level waste is 
concerned, it is impossible to give a clearcut answer at this 
stage, because such waste takes tens of thousands of years to 
decay and the requirements relating to its storage deep 
underground are exceptionally stringent. 
  The studies and investigations carried out by Bulgarian 
Academy of Sciences have produced 56 scientific papers, the main 
results of which were submitted in summary form to the 
interested government departments. We now face a far more 
demanding and difficult task that must be fulfilled without 
delay, namely to complete additional studies and investigations 
of the most promising prospective storage sites and then select 
a few of them for detailed investigation. Such detailed 
investigations are extremely expensive (in the United States, 
Switzerland, Italy, and other countries they cost tens of 
millions of dollars), and for this reason it is vitally 
important to select the fewest possible prospective sites. 
  It takes over 10 years to investigate, design, and construct 
a storage depot for low- and medium-level waste, and 20 to 30 
years to construct one for high-level radioactive waste. We 
therefore have no time to lose, and should immediately begin the 
next stage of completing the task on the basis of the Academy of 
Sciences report. Naturally, this cannot be achieved without 
active government intervention. In the United States, the 
commission on the problem of a national radioactive waste 
storage depot was chaired by the President himself. In Bulgaria 
too, the head of state should oversee the solving of this 
problem, in view of the negative reaction that may be expected 
from the local population and the risk of departmental interests 
exerting excessive influence. The responsible departments 
already display extreme secretiveness regarding information on 
contacts with prospective foreign partners, on the allocation of 
funds, and the conditions for their use, which is evidently 
connected with rivalry in controlling these funds. There is a 
real danger that the money that we will borrow from foreign 
creditors will be frittered away in the departmental budgets or 
appropriated in one form or another by foreign companies without 
any major work being completed. 
  This is why we insist that the government should most 
actively address the problem of finding a storage site for the 
radioactive waste from our nuclear plant and adopt concrete 
decisions on a national strategy and legislation, on setting up 
an independent agency for controlling radioactive waste, and on 
pressing issues relating to further investigations and research 
into designing the storage depot. 
  Bulgaria has indeed delayed far too long in resolving the 
radioactive waste problem. However, we still have at our 
disposal a considerable reserve of competent scientists and 
specialists, the geology of our land has been thoroughly 
surveyed, and all this forms a good basis for making speedy 
progress. 
  In Western countries with advanced nuclear power industries, 
one basic principle in developing a national strategy is not to 
leave succeeding generations with any economic or ecological 
problems arising from the underground storage of radioactive 
waste. In Bulgaria, on the other hand, we have tacitly adopted 
a different ``strategy,'' according to which our generation will 
merely consume the nuclear energy, while the following 
generations will have to solve the problem of dealing with the 
radioactive waste from nuclear power production.

Licenses''] 
  [Text] ``Recently one has been able to notice a trend of 
uncontrolled importation of pesticides in our country, which is 
confirmed by the results of the inspections carried out by 
expert institutions, firms, and associations active in this 
field, as well as by the Customs, the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and the media.'' This is said in the statement issued 
by the Government of Serbia regarding the uncontrolled 
importation of pesticides, and traffic in dangerous chemical 
substances. POLITIKA has already written on this subject in one 
of the previous issues. 
  The statement also specifies that the sanctions, economic 
difficulties, and high prices of the substances manufactured in 
Yugoslavia actually encourage such an attitude of the farmers, 
who are trying to cope with difficulties by obtaining pesticides 
from abroad, and it is mostly pesticides that are either 
prohibited or not recommended for use in the world. 
  In addition, there is a widespread practice abroad that the 
dangerous substances and pesticides, whose date has expired, are 
exported to the underdeveloped countries of the third world, and 
to the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe. 
  In the past several months the Ministry for Environment has 
come across precisely such cases of traffic and use of 
pesticides with expired dates. The latest case reported is that 
of Jagodina, where 100 kilograms of such pesticides were found. 
  ``According to data issued by the Association for the 
Protection of Yugoslav Flora, last year's needs for supplies of 
substances for the protection of plants amounted to 10,000 
tonnes. Some 8,500 tonnes were produced in the country, while 
nearly 1,800 tonnes were imported. This year the production of 
11,000 tonnes of pesticides has been planned,'' it is said in 
the statement. 
  The government also states that the Association of Pesticide 
Manufacturers of Yugoslavia, as well as the Institute for Flora 
Protection in Belgrade, issued a warning to the Ministry of 
Agriculture on 18 January this year, that last year, within 11 
months, pesticides were imported through more than 120 agencies, 
while only a part of the number had licenses issued by the 
government. As for the rest, it is not known either who issued 
the licenses or who carried out the analysis.

  [Text] Brazil has the highest number of fertilizer 
poisoning cases in the rural area where, in 1992 alone, 3,700 
were reported. The World Health Organization, however, reported 
that this number is only 2 percent of the overall number of 
cases, which totals 185,000. The organization added that 30 
percent of these cases are fatal. 
  Herbicides forbidden in other countries still are in use in 
Brazil, including paraquat, which is used in sugar cane 
plantations. This substance causes lung fibrosis, in addition to 
several other serious illnesses. 
  These cases will be reported during the Second National 
Congress on Workers' Health, which will be held in Brasilia next 
month. Causes of job injury also will be discussed in the 
congress. From 1979 to 1988, more than 46,000 workers died in 
Brazil while 26,000 others suffered injury. Experts from the 
Ministries of Health, Labor, and Social Security and several 
other organizations will attend the congress. They will present 
proposals for the establishment of a policy safeguarding 
workers' health and ensuring better supervision by the internal 
commission in charge of preventing job accidents.

  [Text] The first Environment Minister Manuel Rodriguez 
Becerra assumed his post just a few weeks ago, and the Attorney 
General's Office has already filed charges against him. The 
charges involve the cutting of trees in the forests of El Choco 
Department. 
  According to investigations, the minister and 20 other 
officials of the Choco [word indistinct] Company, CodeChoco, 
authorized the indiscriminate cutting of over 200,000 hectares 
of forest in 1980. Investigations reveal that Rodriguez Becerra, 
who was the director of Indirena [Institute for Development of 
Renewable Natural Resources] at the time and a member of the 
CodeChoco Board of Directors, did not control or verify the 
permits of five companies, including (Barza 1 and Barza 2), for 
exploiting the lumber in the (Chajerado) area. The new minister 
feels that the Codechoco Board of Directors are not responsible 
for that ecological crime. 
  [Begin Rodriguez Becerra recording] I did not 
directly participate nor am I responsible for the exploitation 
of lumber in the Indian territories. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, the Attorney General's Office has said the 
exploitation authorized by CodeChoco led to the extinction of 
over 10 animal species, contamination of the Atrato River, and 
the expulsion of Indian communities from southern Choco.

  [Text] Because of its irregular topography and its 
mountains that rise 3,000 meters above sea level, Honduras has 
great forest and water resources, which suffer pressure and 
exploitation from industry, multinationals, politicians, the 
military, and the general population. 
  The area suitable for agriculture is 27,349 square 
kilometers; evergreen forests account for another 28,353 square 
kilometers; deciduous forests, 23,434; and as for maritime 
coastal resources, the southern zone has most of the mangrove 
forests with 46,756 hectares. 
  The country's water resources include 19 important rivers, 
of 
which the largest are: the Patuca, Ulua, Chamelecon and Aguan 
Rivers in the Atlantic zone; and the Choluteca and Nacaome in 
the Pacific zone. 
  These natural resources are undergoing great pressure from 
unscrupulous investors who stop at no outrage to obtain a few 
millions, without concerning themselves about the rest of the 
population. 
  According to studies, approximately 100,000 hectares of 
evergreen, deciduous, and mangrove forests were destroyed this 
year [1993]. The causes were various: forest fires, migrant 
farming, extensive livestock raising, poor land distribution and 
ownership, timber exports, use as firewood, salt production, and 
the shrimping industry. 
  The rivers suffer most from these problems, since into them 
are discarded garbage, construction debris, silt, fecal matter, 
industrial wastes, and dangerous chemical residues, such as 
nondegradable fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides. Drought 
also contributes resulting in most medium-sized and small 
streams drying up, reducing the volume of water carried by the 
principal rivers. 
  The environmental problems that affect people are alarming, 
including: a rise in the temperature, erosion, droughts and 
floods, poor agricultural production, respiratory, contagious, 
and infectious diseases, skin allergies, and cancerous growths. 
  In order to halt this accelerated process of 
self-destruction, experts in environmental affairs recommend 
stricter laws, institutional responsibility, more resources and 
better management for environmental protection, inventories and 
data centers for protected areas, and better programs for 
promoting public awareness through environmental education. 
Respect by politicians for renewable natural resources is also 
necessary, since any damage to these resources is irreversible.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa--With the approach of the 21st century, 
Honduras does not even possess a sewage treatment system, and 
the population is forced to use water contaminated by feces and 
industrial wastes, without any sign that the government is 
seeking ways to resolve this health problem. 
  The foregoing is part of the presentation on contamination 
of 
the environment offered yesterday [7 Nov 1993] by Luis Munguia, 
the director of the Center for the Study and Control of 
Contaminants (CESCCO) of the Ministry of Health. 
  The official basically attributed this problem to industrial 
wastes and feces deposited in the water and on the ground, from 
which they are carried by the air to food consumed by the public. 
  Munguia confirmed what had already been published by LA 
PRENSA, that 80 percent of the water used by the public is 
contaminated by human waste, except for Tegucigalpa and San 
Pedro Sula, where water is treated before reaching the consumer. 
  As an example, the CESCCO researcher indicated that, of 36 
industrial firms in this city, only one has anything approaching 
a system for treating industrial waste. 
  This suggests, he said, that the remainder of the industries 
contribute to environmental contamination by discarding their 
refuse anywhere. 
  He said that in San Pedro Sula there is a tannery whose 
highly toxic waste is contaminating the Chamelecon River. 
  He described similar situations in innumerable 
municipalities 
throughout the country, where Public Health and municipal 
inspectors do nothing while contamination becomes worse. 
  Obsolete drainage systems, systems of ``floating'' sewage in 
the streets, and inadequate drainage systems in industrial 
enterprises stimulate the increase in environmental 
contamination. This will continue as long as the necessary 
measures are not taken, Munguia said. 
  With unusual frankness for an official, Munguia said that 
there are agencies that have no reason to exist. Some agencies 
are afraid to enforce the law with companies that contaminate 
the environment, and others authorize unrestrained urban 
construction without any regulation. 
  The timidity shown by the authorities in applying the law to 
those companies without sewage treatment systems is related to 
political commitments they have made with business during 
campaigns. ``Something must be done today, not tomorrow or the 
day after.'' With that remark, Munguia launched an appeal to 
society to join the fight to protect the environment from 
pollution. 
  CESCCO expert Guillermo Espinoza also took part in the cycle 
of lectures and outlined the actions that the organization 
carries out in its role as investigative agency for problems of 
contamination.

<F P=106> [Article by Ester Marlene Amaya: ``According to a Current </F>
Study by DIMA, 20 Industries are Contaminating Rivers With Their 
Wastes''] 
  [Text] San Pedro Sula--Based on the results of a new study 
of the protection and management of water resources that has 
been carried out over the past six months by the Municipal Water 
Division (DIMA), the new mayor of the city will have to take 
measures regarding the contamination caused by a number of 
industries that discard their untreated solid wastes into rivers. 
  During the televised forum in which the candidates for the 
San Pedro Sula mayorship participated, the subject of industrial 
contamination was examined in greater depth by Nationalist 
candidate Samuel Bogran. 
  Bogran revealed that industry is contaminating all of the 
natural water courses around San Pedro Sula, causing eight times 
more contamination than the entire population of the city could 
cause with its solid wastes. 
  He said that four of the industries alone produce twice the 
contamination that could be caused by the entire population of 
San Pedro Sula. 
  Liberal candidate Luis Garcia Bustamente said that his 
platform for governing called for the installation of treatment 
plants for residual waters. 
  Based on a preliminary study conducted by DIMA, in 1991 the 
municipality of San Pedro Sula passed an ordinance that 
requested businessmen whose firms discarded wastes into the 
Bermejo, Blanco, and Sauce Rivers to seek ways to treat those 
wastes in order not to contaminate the rivers. 
  DIMA's technical manager, engineer Jose Tulio Gomez, said 
that in addition to industrial wastes, the rivers are also 
contaminated by human waste, and diesel and petroleum residues 
discarded by a number of factories. 
  Businessmen have indicated that investment in treatment 
plants involves high costs, and for this reason the directors of 
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Cortes (CCIC) have met 
with citizens and with Mayor Hector Guillen, to seek a 
coordinated solution to the problem. 
  In addition, Gomez said that according to the results of the 
study that includes a plan for inspection of residual waters, 
the new mayor will have to define the measures to be 
implemented, taking into account that the new law on the 
environment is more specific on the subject, as is the sanitary 
code. 
  Gomez said that the current study on the protection and 
management of water resources will be completed in January 1994. 
  The study is being conducted by the firms Hazen and 
Sawyer-Saibe and Associates, at a cost of $2.5 million financed 
by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). 
  Gomez said that 20 kinds of industry (dairy, plastics, 
tanning, paint, etc.) typically discard their industrial wastes 
into rivers. 
  He explained that at the moment the study does not propose 
solutions because it is not completed, and what exists so far is 
a preliminary report. 
  In past years DIMA has produced other studies of liquid 
industrial wastes, one at a cost of $30,000 and another for 
100,000 lempiras. 
  These studies indicate that industrial discharges into the 
Blanco, Sauce, and Bermejo Rivers have a very high organic 
content, as well as metals and acids. 
  The master plan for potable water, still under preparation, 
provides for the construction of a residual water treatment 
plant for the city, but industry must meet certain standards so 
that the plant does not incur higher costs and, as a result, 
cause higher fees for users. 
  According to DIMA, the plant is expected to begin operation 
in the year 2000, and a study is now being completed that will 
be presented to the IDB with a loan request.

<F P=106> [Article by Z. Aliou Salah: ``First International Conference </F>
on Water: Sounding the Alarm''--first paragraph is LIBERTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] A vital element, water is getting increasingly 
scarce. 
  According to statistics, Algerian water consumption 
increased 
from 1,770 cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] per person per year in 
1955 to 689 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year now. 
  For future years, the most optimistic forecasts count on 
only 
332 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year. The availability of this 
precious resource, essential for economic and social 
development, is therefore quite restricted and will become still 
more so if part of it becomes unavailable because of the urban, 
industrial, and agricultural population or again because of 
constant daily waste. Add to this runaway demographic growth. 
The mobilization, transportation, distribution of water, and the 
preservation of its quality require considerable financial 
resources, which the state cannot go on providing forever at the 
expense of other economic activities. Mr. Zebarene, general 
inspector at the Ministry of Equipment, told Channel 3 that if 
we are to achieve savings, ``we cannot continue to manage our 
resources as we are doing now.'' ``Economic tools that deter 
aggression against the water environment and provide incentives 
to save water and make the necessary investments,'' are 
essential, he said, adding that ``everybody's good will alone is 
not enough.'' To finance the water sector, the Ministry of 
Equipment stated that it would be desirable to adopt rates 
reflecting Algeria's economic realities. For instance, faced 
with the increasing scarcity of what is considered as a source 
of life, optimum management of our water resources remains a 
must. To this end, a conference covering various themes will 
take place today and tomorrow at the headquarters of the 
National Data-Processing Systems Company [ENSI]. 
  ``Water resources, the fragility of water, water as an 
economic product, and the organization of the water sector,'' 
such are the four themes to be considered by the conference. 
This first conference, chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, minister of 
equipment, and attended by the governors of the principal 
Algerian towns, will consider the management of the public 
service, the economics and organization of water production, and 
water distribution. 
  In addition to these specific themes, the conference will 
also consider questions having to do with pollution, storage, 
the collection of underground and surface water, and the role of 
water in the national economy.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec 9--The national environment tribunal 
bill, 1992 has been amended, taking away the power of the 
Central government to exempt any undertaking or corporation, 
owned or controlled by the state or Central governments, from 
the liability of damages in case of a mishap in their premises. 
  This has been done by dropping clause 4 of the original bill 
on the recommendation of the department-related parliamentary 
standing committee on science &amp; technology, environment and 
forests. The report of the committee was presented to the Rajya 
Sabha yesterday. 
  The committee also added a new sub-clause, aimed at 
empowering the national environment tribunal to take up claim 
cases for compensation suo moto. 
  The committee has observed that though the title of the bill 
conveys an impression that it is very comprehensive and covers 
all cases of liability and compensation arising due to 
environmental damage or pollution, whatever be its cause, its 
scope is actually restricted to cases concerning the protection 
of environment and payment of compensation for damage to 
persons, property and the environment while handling hazardous 
substances. 
  ``The committee strongly feels that the government may 
seriously think of enlarging the scope of the bill by including 
cases of compensation for damages which are caused even by such 
substances as have not been identified as hazardous by the 
ministry of environment and forests...,'' the report says.

  [Text] Amritsar, Dec 17--Amritsar is fast becoming one of 
the most polluted cities in the state, according to a study 
conducted by the state pollution board. 
  The quantity of suspended particle matter (SPM), commonly 
known as dust particles, has registered a 50 percent increase in 
the past seven months, while the sulphur dioxide content in the 
air has shot up by 100 percent in the same period. In addition, 
36 lakh kg of organic fluid is discharged from various sources 
daily, spelling disaster for the crops in the vicinity. 
  The state environment secretary, Mr. J. S. Maini, in his 
keynote address at a workshop organised by the pollution board 
here recently, had referred to the substantial increase in 
air-related diseases among the locals. He had warned that this 
might assume alarming proportions if allowed to grow unchecked. 
  Pollution is at times so acute in the residential colonies 
on 
Batala road that a white sheet left in the open often turns 
black overnight as the suspended particles settle down. 
  Amritsar now comes a close second to Ludhiana in the 
pollution chart released by the board every week. The city 
recorded 840 and 640 microgram normal cubic metre of suspended 
particles against the permissible limit of 200 microgram normal 
cubic metre.

  [Text] New Delhi has made it clear that it will not allow 
GATT or any other global forum to review its priorities of 
development. The minister for environment, Mr. Kamalnath, says 
India is opposed to any absolute specifications for conservation 
of forests which are a community asset. Addressing a round 
table discussion organized by the UN Environment Program and 
UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development] in 
Geneva, he termed the efforts to put environmental barriers on 
trade as green imperialism. Mr. Kamalnath said any move for 
global (?ecological) system amounts to legitimizing 
extraterritorial interference. He called for a moratorium on 
linking trade with environment unless it impinges clearly on 
collective ecological security.

  [Text] The crude birth rate, which was 41.7 per 1,000 from 
1951-61, decreased to 29 per 1,000 in 1992. The crude death 
rate, which was 22.8 from 1951-61, decreased to 10 in 1992. The 
total fertility rate, which was 5.97 from 1951-61, decreased to 
3.6 in 1991. The infant mortality rate for the country as a 
whole has decreased from 146 per 1,000 live births from 1961-79 
to 71 in 1992. While these are significant achievements, the 
increase in population is still staggering. The government 
attaches the highest importance to reducing the population 
growth rate. There is a national consensus to promote family 
welfare. For this, multidimensional and multisectoral efforts 
involving state governments, opinion leaders, nongovernmental 
organizations, and all sections of society are essential. All 
political parties must unanimously exhort the people to adopt 
the small-family norms and transform the family program into a 
mass movement. The National Development Council [NDC] has 
endorsed the recommendation of the Committee on Population it 
set up earlier. The NDC also decided to hold wider 
consultations with the chief ministers and opinion makers on the 
future course of action needed to implement the NDC's 
recommendations. This will be done shortly. 
  We are fully aware of the links between the development 
process and protection of the environment. The need for the 
conservation and wise use of natural resources is reflected in 
our major river cleaning and pollution abatement programs, as 
well as in our forest and wildlife policies. While 
participating in the continuing international debate on 
biodiversity, climate change, and increasing desertification, we 
have kept in focus the basic issues -- raised at the 1992 Rio 
summit -- of access to resources and technology. Within the 
government, our development efforts will take full note of all 
our environmental concerns. 
  The pace of technological changes and the need to shift to 
technologies that are environmentally compatible imposes various 
demands on us. Restrictions placed on the transfer of 
technology require us to rely more on our own talents. The 
government is committed to encourage this to happen by tapping 
the great potential that the country possesses.

<F P=106> [Article: ``Environmental Laws Ineffective: Expert''] </F>
  [Text] Nagpur, Jan 9 -- Despite a large number of 
legislations, constitutional directives and the setting up of 
pollution control boards all over the country, India's success 
in curbing environmental degradation has been negligible, 
according to Mr. M. C. Mehta, general secretary of the Indian 
council of enviro-legal action, New Delhi. 
  This was stated by Mr. Mehta in a paper on the ``Role of 
judiciary in environmental protection'' presented at the 
Indo-British workshop on ``Environmental impact and risk 
assessment of petrochemical industry and environmental audit'' 
currently being held at the National Environmental Engineering 
Research Institute (NEERI) campus here. 
  Mr. Mehta was not present at the workshop, but his paper has 
been included for consideration by the workshop participants. 
  Mr. Mehta noted that there are about 200 legislations in 
India, which directly or indirectly relate to environment 
protection. The earliest one, the Shore Nuisance (Bombay and 
Colaba) Act was passed way back as 1853 and the latest one was 
the Environment Protection Act of 1986. But these legislations 
did not have the desired effect, he regretted. 
  However, a significant development in the past decade has 
been the increasing number of public interest litigations 
initiated by people belonging to all walks of life and the role 
played by the supreme court and some of the high courts in the 
protection of the environment. The courts have taken upon 
themselves to expand the ambit of article 21 of the constitution 
by interpreting that the right to life included the right to 
live in a healthy environment. 
  Mr. Mehta alleged that because of the close nexus between 
the 
industry and the authorities, effective implementation of 
environment laws have been blocked. Also, there was not enough 
public consciousness about environmental issues. 
  Mr. Mehta has made a fervent plea for implementing the 
supreme court's suggestion, made in 1956 while hearing the Delhi 
gas leak case, for the setting up of environmental courts. He 
noted that at present more than 4,500 population-related cases 
were pending before various courts in the country with no sign 
of them being disposed of early. 
  He cited serious environmental problems like pollution of 
rivers by industries, loss of millions of acres of fertile soil 
and crops due to ground water contamination by discharge of 
toxic industrial effluents and alarming rate of deforestation.

<F P=106> [Article: ``New Dimension to Poll Panel -- Assam Tussel''] </F>
  [Text] Guwahati, Jan 13 -- Yet another battle is on the 
cards in the prolonged war between the Election Commission and 
the Government of Assam. 
  In its latest order issued on 11 January, the Election 
Commission has directed the State Government to undertake 
`special revision' of electoral rolls in respect of the 40 
Assembly constituencies (out of the total 126) where their use 
had been stayed pending `approval and clearance of the Election 
Commission.' 
  This unusual intervention, withholding the publication of 
electoral rolls of almost one-third of the total number of 
constituencies in the State, was made between the publication of 
the draft electoral rolls on 5 October 1993 and the eve of the 
publication of the final electoral rolls on 27 December 1993. 
This step clearly invested the popular perception among most 
Assamese speaking people that the State had a very large number 
of `illegal aliens' most of whom were seen as inhabiting the 
very areas covered by these Assembly constituencies, 
illustrative of the catholicity of the political choice of these 
`suspected illegal aliens' is the fact that candidates from all 
the major political parties in the State were returned from 
these 40 constituencies in the last elections, though there was 
a marked preference for the Congress whose nominees, won from 23 
of these constituencies. The other parties representing the 
remaining 17 of these `suspect' constituencies are: AGP (Asom 
Gana Parishad (Assam People's Council)) (five, including 
Barhampur, represented by the former Chief Minister, Mr. 
Prafulla Kumar Mahanta), BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) (four), 
Bodoland Legislature Party (three), CPI (Communist Party of 
India) (two), SUCI (two) and Independent (one). 
  Basic document: The most interesting feature of 
the `special revision' with 1 January 1994 as the `qualifying 
date,' is that they will have as the basic document the draft 
electoral rolls published on 5 October last year. In other 
words, the Election Commission has taken exception to the 
procedures and actual conduct followed in the preparation of the 
final electoral rolls between that date and 27 December 1993, 
and has directed the State authorities to go over the whole 
process once again. All indications are that the impasse will 
not be broken since the structures in the State (as well as the 
political and other compulsions that presumably vitiated the 
earlier process remain the same. 
  The Election Commission has also directed the State 
authorities to take up a `summary revision' with respect to the 
86 Assembly constituencies whose final electoral rolls it had 
allowed to be published barely three weeks ago, with 1 January 
as the fresh qualifying date.

<F P=106> [Article by Khasan Iskandarov: </F>
``Ecology: Will Tashkent Become Port City? Idea of Diverting 
Siberian Rivers Seems To Have Captured Masses' Imagination 
Again''] 
  [Text] The intensive contacts among the presidents of the 
former Central Asian republics that have characterized the start 
of the year, for all the seeming diversity of the problems 
raised and proposed for solutions, have one common thread. Every 
meeting has discussed the question of saving the Aral Sea. It is 
a truly important question and one that requires a prompt and 
effective solution. The ecological disaster zone that the Aral 
region has been declared is inhabited by people, and life is 
hard for them. But the remarkable thing is this: All the 
presidents want to solve the water supply problem not using 
their own funds and resources, but by diverting northern rivers 
to Central Asia. 
  No one is talking about this openly, but just such an option 
is continually being implied. But why now, in winter? The time 
is not far off when it will be necessary to begin irrigating 
crops, a sizable place among which is held by cotton, and the 
meager water resources will start being divided. This year, 
judging from specialists' forecasts, will be just as dry as 
previous ones. And water has always been valued especially 
highly in the East: It has caused conflicts and strife, and 
things have often reached the point of using force. The Tajiks 
have fought with the Uzbeks and the Uzbeks have fought with the 
Kirgiz; this is true of not only ancient times, but also the 
very recent past. Today the new states of Central Asia are to 
some extent being saved by the continuing war in Afghanistan. 
It's terrible to say, but true. If the war were to stop and the 
Afghan tribes to begin raising crops, a very difficult situation 
would ensue. Four countries would immediately find themselves on 
dry rations. 
  This is what accounts for the flurry of activity. 
  One would think that the insane idea of diverting part of 
the 
flow of Siberian rivers to Central Asia had been buried once and 
for all. But this is not the case, and increasingly persistent 
efforts are being in Uzbekistan to sway public opinion in favor 
of a positive resolution of the erstwhile ``project of the 
century.'' 
  It is being actively suggested to the people who are 
suffering from a water shortage and poor water quality that only 
the postponed diversion of Siberian rivers can save them from 
disease and utter extinction. 
  But the devil is not so black as he is painted; in other 
words, what is the actual water situation in the republic? In 
the rayons of the Aral region, it is truly catastrophic. The 
waters of the Syrdarya essentially stopped reaching the area in 
1976. Only up to three cubic kilometers of water a year flow 
into the Aral from the Amudarya. Yet both rivers initially carry 
almost 20 times that much. Is all the water being diverted by 
continually developing agriculture? Hardly, although this is 
true in the sense that farmers take as much as they can, not as 
much as they need. Irrigation norms in Uzbekistan are overstated 
by a factor of 1.6. A similar picture obtains in Kazakhstan and 
Turkmenia. And let us ponder the following fact: In just over 
the past 10 years, 84 billion cubic meters of water have been 
used for irrigation in the Aral basin, while discharges of water 
after irrigation into undrained valleys and losses in the 
much-touted Karakum canal exceed 100 billion cubic meters. An 
entire system of large lakes with no commercial purpose has 
formed in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Waters that once could 
have fed the Aral Sea have now flooded vast tracts of land and 
farmland. On the one hand, we have a dying sea, and on the other 
hand, we have lifeless lakes that stretch for hundreds of 
kilometers. 
  When the decision to drop the idea of diverting part of the 
flow of Siberian rivers somewhat sobered the most adventuristic 
heads, a great many alternative solutions to the problem were 
proposed in Uzbekistan--effective and serious proposals. 
Specifically, one plan called for diverting drainage waters that 
are currently being discharged into undrained steppe depressions 
(Aydarkul and Sarykamysh) along a natural channel into the Aral. 
Another proposal called for dividing the Aral's water up with 
earthen dams, thereby making it possible to manage its cycles. 
Yet another called for carrying out large-scale 
phyto-amelioration and forest-conservation projects, treating 
the drying sea bottom with cementitious material, building a 
right-bank discharge drain along the entire length of the 
Amudarya, and so forth. All these projects would require 
enormous capital investments, which Uzbekistan simply cannot 
come up with on its own. But the problem is not so much the 
money (it could ultimately be scraped together with Russia's 
help), as people. There is no one to implement the project in a 
republic burdened with surplus labor resources. A paradox? It's 
really more of a logically consistent pattern. The nearly 3 
million people who currently live in the lower reaches of the 
Amudarya from Khorezm to the Aral do not want and will not build 
either a discharge drain or dams, despite the fact that they are 
the ones who are currently forced to use water contaminated with 
pesticides and other chemicals. 
  Readers, believe this author, for he is hardly indifferent 
to 
the fate of millions of fellow citizens who live in the 
ecological disaster zone. But there is only one possible 
solution to this problem--to conserve the water already 
available in the republic. 
  Writer P. Shermukhammedov, chairman of the committee for 
saving the Aral, believes that without large financial and other 
outlays, just by taking water conservation steps, the sea could 
receive 30 to 35 cubic kilometers of water annually, and that 
would stabilize the Aral at the existing mark. 
  There is one other aspect of the problem that, if 
unremarked, 
makes it hard to explain just why the republic leadership is 
inclined to insist on the option rejected eight years ago. 
People in Uzbekistan try not to talk about it, for it is fraught 
with certain extremely negative consequences. The birth rate in 
Uzbekistan currently exceeds the average world level. Scientists 
call it a demographic explosion that could very likely become a 
social explosion. This is no joke, and the prognosis is not all 
that unrealistic. Suffice it to recall the events in the 
overpopulated Fergana Valley. Uzbekistan has more than 22 
million people today, but as Karimov has said, that figure will 
double in 10 years. 
  Meanwhile, Eastern-style democracy has revived previously 
suppressed Islamic religious forces that oppose any attempts to 
control the birth rate, something they say is at odds with true 
Muslim traditions. 
  And one final point. Methods of saving the Aral are still in 
the theoretical stage. Despite the practical recommendations 
devised by a number of specialized institutes, their 
implementation remains highly problematical. I will venture to 
express what is perhaps a trenchant but, in my opinion, the sole 
possible explanation for what is going on. Impeding the 
implementation of the existing projects is a kind of Eastern 
stratagem whose aim is to exacerbate the situation in the 
ecological disaster zone so much as to make a diversion of 
Siberian rivers the only likely solution to the crisis. 
  I hope I am wrong, but I fear that this is indeed the case.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Yablokov, adviser on questions of </F>
ecology to the president of Russia, by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
observer Mikhail Shevelev; place and date not given: ``Leaders: 
Aleksey Yablokov''] 
  [Text] ``...I intend to resign. Rather, I am thinking 
about it very hard....'' 
  In the discussion the presidential adviser calls the Russian 
Government, as in the old days, the Council of Ministers, and he 
finds it difficult to remember the precise names of the 
instances and state posts. It is remarkable that four years of 
work in the highest echelons of power have not been enough to 
take the real bureaucrat out of him. 
  Shevelev: Do you intend to run for the Duma? 
  Yablokov: No. Out of considerations of principle. 
I am familiar with this work from the Union parliament and I do 
not find it especially interesting. 
  Moreover the Green Movement cannot count on a large number 
of 
seats in parliament now. I have the opportunity to analyze the 
president's mail and I see that this subject occupies 10th to 
12th place in importance...so we will have to join in a bloc 
with other parties, that is, get involved in politics. 
  I came to the president's administration to work as an 
adviser and I hope that I will be able to do some real work. And 
up until this spring I had not been disappointed. 
  Shevelev: And what happened in the spring? 
  Yablokov: I saw that I had no support behind me. 
The ministry of environmental protection came out in support of 
the program for the development of atomic energy. I said that it 
could not be adopted without an expert ecological evaluation, 
but in the cabinet meeting I was supported only by Minister of 
Justice Nikolay Fedorov. There are some things that cannot be 
done, there is a limit to compromise. 
  Shevelev: Does the problem lie only in your 
disagreements with the minister of environmental protection? 
  Yablokov: I think that what happened with him, the 
fact that he was not able to resist bureaucratic pressure, says 
something about the entire government. Is this really the 
government we dreamed about when Gaydar and Burbulis came? Did 
we need eight or nine deputy prime ministers with duplicate 
functions? Did it not turn out to be uncontrollable?... 
  Shevelev: Aleksey Vladimirovich, you are speaking 
as a person who intends to retire. 
  Yablokov: I intend to leave. Rather, I am thinking 
about it very hard...in the spring when I understood that I 
would not be able to get through the Council of Ministers I 
suggested raising these issues at the Security Council. For now 
an interdepartmental commission on questions of ecology has been 
created. If nothing happens here.... 
  Shevelev: ``Raise questions,'' ``interdepartmental 
commission''--this does not sound very inspiring.... 
  Yablokov: This is my last chance. Let us look. 
Yesterday, for example, at this commission they discussed what 
to do with the submarine Komsomolets. The direst predictions 
from four years ago are coming true. The plutonium has turned 
into a mushy mass and only the beryllium lining is keeping it 
from spilling out. 
  Shevelev: How long, in your opinion, will it hold 
out? 
  Yablokov: A year. 
  Shevelev: And what did your interdepartmental 
commission decide to do? 
  Yablokov: There were voices that said we should 
not get upset. But when it came to the question of who would 
sign such a decision--not to do anything--there were none who 
were willing. We will spend money now because otherwise, if the 
plutonium starts leaking, we will spend 10 times as much on 
fines alone. And we will also be blamed for others' 
pollution--we know the rules of this game--for example, the 
discharge of plutonium from the British nuclear power plant in 
Sellafield. 
  At the next session of the commission we shall be 
considering 
a document with this name: ``The Threat to National Security in 
Connection With Reduction of the Fertility of the Soil.'' Last 
month we considered technogenic accidents. Just think: Each day 
there are two large accidents in petroleum and gas fields, each 
week there is a serious accident on rail transportation, each 
month in industry, and every half year there is an accident like 
Tomsk-7 or the fire at KamAZ which cost us taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of rubles. 
  Shevelev: And in this situation you are thinking 
about retirement? 
  Yablokov: We are not in England or in Sweden. 
There they have significant nongovernmental organizations, for 
example, ecological ones, which will not allow the ruling party 
to make big mistakes. This is not fighting, but cooperation in 
administration. But here...if at that damned meeting on the 
development of nuclear energy I had not simply spoken with 
emotion--and I simply shouted there that this program must not 
be adopted--and if instead I had a well substantiated, well 
argued document...but under our conditions it is impossible to 
get such a document through state structures. 
  Shevelev: Why? 
  Yablokov: The system resists. For example, the 
program for the development of energy is now being considered. 
At best we will receive nuclear energy at the previous level, 
and at worst--on an even larger scale. And yet there are other 
possibilities! SU fighter engines use kinds of technical 
solutions that, if applied in gas turbine electric power plants, 
in three years and with $6 billion we could solve the problem of 
energy supply. And to bring our nuclear power plants up to the 
level of safety in the West, which we, gritting our teeth, will 
agree to do, will take, according to certain estimates, 160 
billion [no currency specified]. Everybody knows this including 
Yeltsin and Gaydar. They issued an order for Shumeyko to create 
a commission. It was created but it never met even once. I went 
to the president three times, I cannot do more. I am not an 
intriguer! 
  Shevelev: Does it seem to you that the resistance 
from the system is spontaneous or does it have a mercenary basis? 
  Yablokov: There are no mercenary interests. There 
are departmental ones. I cannot accuse the minister of nuclear 
energy of being concerned about his own pocketbook. The 
department is what is important to him. 
  Shevelev: But they are the same thing. Whoever has 
the bigger budget is the one who lives better. So we have not 
gone anywhere in the past five years? The word itself seems 
somehow archaic Sovietism--``departmentalism''... 
  Yablokov: Two years ago it seemed that everything 
would be different. I remember these government meetings; I 
participated in them. There were like-thinkers: Gaydar, 
Burbulis, the people who were at their side. And for some time 
they acted as like-thinkers. But then came bureaucratic life: A 
decree has to be adopted here, 50 salaries have to be added 
there, create a department here--and we had no antidote. Now so 
many decrees are being adopted it makes your head spin! The 
government made a resolution last year: The same department may 
not use natural resources and be in charge of their use. A week 
ago Zaveryukha, the deputy prime minister in charge of 
agriculture, put through a resolution on the creation of a Main 
Hunting Administration under his jurisdiction. And the way he 
did it! Even Yarov, who is responsible for natural resources in 
the government, did not know about it. And they lie at the same 
time! They said it was coordinated with the ministry for 
protection of the environment...it was not coordinated! So with 
relations like these I do not see a place for myself. 
  Shevelev: But you still have hope in the Security 
Council. 
  Yablokov: Perhaps they will take a different 
attitude toward its resolutions. 
  Shevelev: And do you have no hopes for the new 
forms of management? If the state is anti-ecology perhaps 
private capital will be more reasonable? 
  Yablokov: They have their own threats here, but 
there is a solution. The condition of the environment we have 
here existed in America, Japan, and Europe 30 years ago. And now 
people are swimming in the Rhine and trout have appeared in the 
Thames. They did it! How? The polluter pays, and not mythical 
fines but enough to reimburse the society for damages. Then 
there is payment for the utilization of nature. If there is no 
master of the land this means, in the first place, that you can 
pollute wherever you want to and, in the second place, nobody is 
responsible. And, finally, instead of writing complaints we must 
learn how to defend our rights in court. And we even have 
precedents. The socioecological alliance took the government to 
court for a resolution concerning the development of the nuclear 
power industry, and the Constitutional Court accepted it. And I 
know that the government started thinking. 
  But on the other hand we must copy nothing categorically. 
The 
average Swede or American consumes 60-70 times more energy 
resources than citizens of other countries do. If we, the 
largest country in the world, adopt this type of utilization of 
nature, the world will simply have no future. 
  Shevelev: Perhaps Greenpeace is right; they fight 
for this future using desperate, almost irrational actions. 
  Yablokov: Almost a year and a half ago I was in 
charge of the Soviet branch of Greenpeace--not everything is so 
simple here. Of course, desperate actions are necessary, but 
with respect to Greenpeace--and this is a powerful 
organization--there is reason to believe that certain interests 
are behind them. 
  On the one hand, there is the sincere enthusiasm of honest 
young people who are indeed taking a risk. For example, members 
of Rainbows of War--that is the Russian analog to 
Greenpeace--were simply beaten when they tried to stop work on a 
mine in Samarskaya Luka National Park. On the other hand, there 
is the suspicion that there is a great deal of money behind all 
this. 
  Shevelev: A way of eliminating competitors? 
  Yablokov: Perhaps. 
  Shevelev: But ultimately it was because of 
Greenpeace that we learned about the pouring out of radioactive 
wastes in the Far East. 
  Yablokov: A good example. You know the ecological 
significance of this discharge? None. The radioactivity was 0.38 
curies. Japanese nuclear power plants annually discharge 
hundreds of curies. The British and French--thousands of curies 
a year. Such is the scale of the event. 
  Shevelev: Why did our government have to take the 
blame for this? 
  Yablokov: Most likely they were afraid of a 
political outcry. But the people who made this affair 
public--they were highly professional. They must have known that 
radioactivity below one curie is not even considered pollution. 
But then you wonder why? 
  Shevelev: So the only result of all the hubbub 
were credits obtained to modernize and construct plants for 
processing radioactive wastes. 
  Yablokov: So it would seem. 
  Shevelev: Since our discussion has come around to 
the ecological movement, are you not disturbed by the fact that 
these organizations have frequently taken nationalistic 
positions? 
  Yablokov: I am. The ecological movements were the 
first manifestations of the opposition to be allowed. And what 
did they produce? Rigid, uncompromising nationalistic 
organizations in the Baltic, Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia. The 
picture is similar in Russia. This makes me bitter because I 
have fundamental political differences with Rasputin who, like 
myself, is protecting Lake Baykal. But he is an absolutely 
sincere person and he speculates a very great deal...any 
argument of the nationalists: the birth rate is declining, the 
nation is dying out! But we should not juggle the facts: Even 
ten years ago all predictions said that we were proceeding 
toward these indicators. 
  Shevelev: You are a man of science. Were you 
willing to get involved in all this...politics? 
  Yablokov: Up until 1986 I could only dream about 
having the information that is available to me now. Now I regret 
the fact that I do not have time to interpret it. During the 
past four years I have accumulated unique experience in 
ecological activities in higher echelons of power. It would be a 
shame not to take advantage of it. 
  Shevelev: And has the perestroyka frenzy passed? 
  Yablokov: You know, my father died from cancer, 
and then my mother, and then my wife too. And among the causes 
of oncological diseases--70 percent are in the ecology, in the 
environment. I do not want my grandsons to die of cancer. For me 
politics is a personal issue.

  (Video report by correspondent Sergey Sergeyev, identified 
by caption, from the ``Novosti'' newscast] 
  [Text] 
  Sergeyev: [Video shows people working with 
various types of machinery and containers, a storage area, a 
room with control panels and computer screens] This is a 
section that turns the atomic industry's radioactive waste into 
glass. Three years ago, the Mayak Production Association in the 
South Urals increased its use of a furnace that was, and is 
unique. Russian atomic industry workers were the first to 
master, on an industrial scale, the technology for turning waste 
into a glass-like material that is then poured into these steel 
containers, made airtight, and then placed in storage cells. 
Encased in solid concrete, the nuclear genie cannot get out. 
One hundred and fifty million curies of radioactivity have been 
rendered safe so far. By way of comparison: This represents 
three Chernobyls. No one in the world has ever placed such a 
quantity of radioactive waste in storage. Colleagues from 
France, Britain, the United States, and Japan have taken an 
interest in the experience of the Mayak atomic workers. Similar 
facilities are being built there now. However, there is a 
problem. Another two or three more glass-making installations 
need to be built for all of the waste that was accumulated 
during the 40 or more years of Mayak's work for the defense 
industry to be processed quickly. But this important ecological 
program is not being fully financed, and the Urals atomic 
industry workers will not be able to deal with this problem on 
their own, without the state's help.

Eastern correspondent: ``The Eastern Shore Is Still 
Inhabited...'' 
  [Text] 
  Russia's Pacific coast is threatened by a general 
environmental disaster. Freighters and nuclear submarines 
belonging to the Pacific Fleet and loaded with liquid 
radioactive wastes are docked at seaports in the Far Eastern 
region. Furthermore, some of the vessels are in a dangerously 
dilapidated condition. The situation is extremely hazardous, and 
at this time there is no solution to the problem. That was the 
announcement made a few days ago by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 
administration chief of Maritime Kray. 
<H5>  MN Dossier </H5>
  There are only 10 areas in the Far Eastern seas where 
radioactive waste (both liquid and solid) is dumped. Just one of 
these, located in the Sea of Japan 105 nautical miles from 
Vladivostok, 80 miles from Nakhodka and 295 miles from Hokkaido, 
has over the past 20 years been the dump site for more than 
33,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes with a total 
radioactivity of 10,842 curies. In addition, 9,846 cubic meters 
of solid radioactive waste with a total radioactivity of 2,230 
curies has also been dumped there. At the same site the sea 
floor at a depth of 3,250-3,700 meters is littered with 1,689 
containers and 18 vessels filled with solid radioactive waste 
taken from the power units of nuclear submarines, five steam 
generators and 21 circulating pumps, which are not even in any 
sort of container whatsoever. 
  For many years the Pacific Fleet dealt with radioactive 
waste 
quite simply: it was all dumped at sea. After a recent 
international scandal in which daring members of the omnipresent 
Greenpeace organization located and announced to the whole world 
radioactive dumping by a Russian freighter in the Sea of Japan, 
central agencies have decreed an end to such operations. The 
extremely polluted Far Eastern seas, which are being turned into 
a radioactive dump, got a respite. Liquid radioactive waste is 
now being stored on shore. No one knows what to do with it. 
  The people of the Far East have been put in a difficult 
situation before by the military units based in their region. 
One need only recall the numerous accidents at sea and on land 
for which the Pacific Fleet has been responsible. Three years 
ago the fleet command attempted to carry out an unprecedented 
operation in Postovaya Bay near Sovetskaya Gavan: disassembly of 
reactors on board outdated nuclear submarines mothballed there. 
On orders from Admiral Gennadiy Khvatov, Pacific Fleet 
commander, the complex task of removing the reactors' 
radioactive nuclear fuel-containing cores -- a task that 
requires trained specialists and special conditions -- was to be 
carried out by the local garrison. But the sailors had never 
done that kind of work before, and the bay was not specially 
equipped for the job. The residents of Sovetskaya Gavan and the 
town of Vanino learned of the planned secret operation by 
chance. It cost them a great deal of effort to stop the military 
from going ahead with the operation. 
  Now there has been another emergency. The defenders of our 
maritime borders cannot utilize liquid radioactive waste, the 
inevitable by-product of nuclear submarine fleet operations. At 
any moment the coastline and all its inhabitants could take a 
drink of that waste. As they expanded the nuclear might of the 
Pacific Fleet military experts gave no thought to safe means of 
utilizing wastes and disassembling decommissioned submarines. 
Local residents' health and very lives were not taken into 
account. 
  Many very beautiful bays and gulfs along the Russian Pacific 
coast have long been inaccessible to people. They are literally 
occupied by military units. Crammed beyond all measure with 
military equipment, unique natural sites are a depressing sight. 
In some places decommissioned submarines have been sitting at 
anchor, aging, for years. Yet experts warn that decommissioned 
submarines should be decontaminated and components utilized 
immediately. Everything that presents a danger should be 
disassembled without delay and disposed of properly. After time 
has passed it is not only difficult to carry out such 
operations, but, depending on the technology, sometimes 
impossible. If, of course, the appropriate safety procedures are 
taken... 
  The creation of the Pacific Fleet, the largest and most 
powerful in the world, cost our country a tremendous amount. Now 
more substantial expenditures will be required to halt the 
destructive effect of this monster on our lives. Thus far the 
Russian Government neither sees nor hears this problem at all. 
  But the Americans have responded. Watching with alarm the 
Russian Far East, their troubled neighbor in the Pacific region, 
they have now become seriously worried. The Bablock-Wilcox 
Company, which specializes in supplying nuclear energy equipment 
to the U.S. Navy, has expressed a willingness to provide our 
navy with the most modern technology for the neutralization of 
radioactive wastes and utilization of nuclear submarines. Donald 
Ray, a company representative who visited Vladivostok a few days 
ago, reported that the U.S. Government, which supports the 
Bablock-Wilcox initiative, plans to allocate $10 million to 
implement it. Japanese specialists are also working on a program 
to help Russia set up special storage facilities for its nuclear 
materials. 
  Our military circles have always been very wary of advice 
from outsiders, particularly when it comes to foreign advisors, 
and they react very negatively to any interference in the area 
of their interests. However, today it appears that there is no 
other option than to cooperate with anyone who expresses a 
desire to help. 
  Russia's eastern shore is in great distress. It would appear 
that it is there that humanity has come to the final frontier, 
beyond which there lies nothing.

<F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenko under the heading ``Eco'': </F>
``View From the Ministry of Environmental Protection: The New 
Year Will Be No Better''] 
  [Text] ``If one compares the current environmental 
situation in Russia with 1992, one unfortunately find that it is 
not improving and remains very acute,'' stated Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and 
natural resources, who held a conference with selected regional 
representatives at year's end. 
  Incidentally, it was noted that the drop in production also 
has its positive aspects: there was a 12-percent decrease in 
comparison to 1992 in pollutant emissions into the atmosphere 
from ``stationary sources.'' 
  Virtually all other pollution indices increased last year, 
though only slightly. There was an increase in pollutant 
emissions resulting from the use of low-quality types of 
gasoline. For example, a Russian-made passenger car produces 
almost as much pollution as seven U.S.-made automobiles (roughly 
21 grams/kilometer per car, as opposed to 3 grams/kilometer for 
an American car). More than 4,000 tonnes of lead-containing 
compounds were released into the atmosphere. Direct 
environmental damage as a result of these emissions is estimated 
at more than R3.0 billion [rubles] annually. 
  The results of observations by experts carried out in the 
atmosphere around Russia's cities and industrial centers 
indicates an increase in concentrations of carbon monoxide, 
carbon disulfide, phenol and nitrogen oxides. During the first 
half of 1993 a total of 207 cases of maximum permissible 
pollutant levels being exceeded by factors of 10 or more were 
reported in 44 cities around the country. There were 88 reported 
incidents of massive one-time air pollution. According to 
environmental protection agencies, the damage done by air 
pollution alone was R280 million in the first six months of 1993. 
  According to the minister the condition of fauna has also 
worsened. Populations of many valuable animal species have 
dropped to dangerously low levels, and fish catches are down as 
well. The reason is habitat exhaustion, as well as a marked 
upsurge in poaching. 
  Another equally important problem for ecologists is 
emergencies caused by natural disasters and manmade accidents. 
1993 witnessed many such incidents. One need only recall the 
accident at Tomsk-7 in April, the flooding in the Urals, and the 
numerous explosions in transportation systems and at a number of 
mines. 
  A lack of funding and a wide range of other reasons do not 
permit the minister of environmental protection to hope that the 
situation will begin to improve in the near future. In Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan's opinion, the task for 1994 will be ``at the 
first stage, at least to halt the worsening of the environmental 
situation.''

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, Feb 9 TASS -- At least four cities and 109 
villages with a total population of 197,000, 1,072 thousand 
hectares of land, and 1,205 kilometers of electric transmission 
lines on the Caspian coast of Russia can be destroyed by the 
advancing sea waters soon, bringing the sum or losses to 17 
billion roubles (in the 1991 prices), unless emergency measures 
are taken, the Russian Federal Security Council was told on 
Tuesday. 
  The council's ecological security commission has asked the 
government for 473.5 billion roubles to protect the coast of the 
Caspian Sea which was recognized an ecological disaster zone. 
  The water level in the Caspian Sea has been rising by an 
average 15 centimeters a year since 1978. On the Russian coast 
3,220 thousand hectares of valuable land has been swamped, 
causing economic damage estimated at 4.3 billion roubles (in the 
1991 prices). 
  The cities of Makhachkala, Derbent and Kaspiisk, as well as 
more than 30 smaller residential centers in Daghestan, the 
Republic of Kalmykia (Khalm-Tangch) and the Astrakhan region, 
are already feeling the impact. The water rim is moving inland 
at a speed of 1-2 kilometers a year. The waves reach up to 20 
kilometers inland, the sanitary situation is deteriorating and 
toxic substances threaten epidemics of plague, cholera and skin 
diseases. 
  The commission worked out more than ten other specific 
recommendations for dealing with the situation caused by the 
continuing rise of the water level in the sea, which is 
threatening the existence of many coastal cities in Russia and 
neighboring countries, as well as off-shore oilwells and 
platforms belonging to Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, 
Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 5 TASS--Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has issued the decree ``On State Strategy of the Russian 
Federation on Ensuring Environmental Protection and Stable 
Development,'' the press service of the Russian president 
reported today. 
  The Russian Government has been assigned to draft and submit 
to the president in 1994 a conceptual framework of the 
transition of the Russian Federation to the steady development 
model, which will ensure a balanced fulfillment of long-term 
tasks of socio-economic development and the maintenance of a 
proper condition of the natural environment and the natural 
resources potential for purposes of meeting the vital interests 
of the population. 
  The decree adopted the main provisions of the state strategy 
of Russia in the sphere of ensuring environmental protection and 
stable development, including the bringing back to normal of the 
upset ecological systems in the ecologically unsafe areas of 
Russia, participation in the solution of some global ecological 
problems and so on.

<F P=106> [From the ``Novosti'' newscast: Video report by A. Korovkin </F>
and V. Sidelnikov, identified by caption; figures in brackets 
denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Text] [060846] [Korovkin over shot of industrial 
plant exterior] According to information from the Ministry 
of the Environment, one-half of Russians drink substandard 
water, while one-third are subjected to the effects of harmful 
waste from enterprises with a concentration of toxic substances 
10 times higher than the acceptable limit. At the same time, 
identifying the sources of the pollution and, most importantly, 
defining its toxicity and measuring the quantity of harmful 
waste was, until recently, a highly complex and difficult 
technical task. This problem has been successfully solved in 
the analytical laboratory of Russia's Military Academy for 
Chemical Protection,. A unique method of monitoring the 
environment using lasers has been developed here. 
  A. Zhitov: [Laboratory chief, identified by 
caption] The originality of this development resides in the 
fact that this is in point of fact the first time that it has 
been possible to obtain spectral forms of the biological and 
chemical composition of aerosols. And in this way, on the basis 
of the said method, it is possible to develop universal remote 
laser systems for monitoring air pollution. 
  Korovkin: The military industry has already 
developed and indeed produces the remote chemical reconnaissance 
device ``Dal'' which, according to the designers themselves, can 
be employed for ecological monitoring purposes almost without 
any modifications or additions. Moreover, experts estimate that 
two ``Dal'' devices can monitor an area the size of Moscow.

  [Excerpts] [070731 thru 070813 -- introductory 
passage omitted] 
  [070814] [Correspondent over video captioned 
``Radar-TV'' showing missile transporters on the move] The 
strategic arms reduction treaties concluded between the United 
States and Russia and known as START I and START II have, apart 
from verbal support, evoked no steps in response from the other 
members of the nuclear club. START II is yet to be ratified by 
Russia. Meanwhile the latter's missiles, including the heavy 
SS-18, continue to be removed from operational sites. This work 
was at its height during the summer and fall of last year. As 
in the past, missile men and defense experts displayed prompt 
and coordinated action at all the stages of the reduction 
process right up to the removal of missiles from silos and the 
draining off of missile fuel components. On the one hand, they 
were working under pressure of a tight schedule since every 
missile had to be removed from alert duty on strictly preset 
days and hours, while on the other hand they had to ensure that 
all the operations were carried out without any dangerous 
pollution of the environment ensuing. [070908] [video 
shows missile being removed from silo, personnel donning gas 
masks, fuel being siphoned off] 
  [070909 thru 071021] [passage omitted on interview with 
engineer who says that ecological safety is guaranteed thanks to 
a closed-circuit system which prevents contact between fuel 
components and atmosphere] 
  [071022] [Correspondent over aerial view of missile 
test range captioned ``Radar-TV, Voyen TV''] Our industry 
cannot do something that it was never equipped to do, in other 
words to salvage simultaneously up to 2,000 ICBM's, hundreds of 
thousands of tonnes of special fluids and nuclear and chemical 
munitions. What is more, we lack the necessary resources. 
  This also applies to cleaning up the Russian Missile Forces' 
sole test range which covers an area of 175,000 hectares. 
During test launches certain parts of the delivery vehicle 
separate. They contain toxic rocket fuel residue. All this 
does not burn up in the atmosphere but falls to the ground and 
into water reservoirs. Two years ago the leadership of the 
Missile Forces together with (?``Transres''), a special science 
and production center, tried for the first time to carry out a 
mass cleanup of the test range, using their own resources. More 
than 2,000 tonnes of delivery vehicle debris was collected, but 
only a small part of the test range was cleared. 
  By agreeing to sweeping reductions of the most powerful and 
technically most sophisticated missiles, Russia has not only 
forfeited its status as an influential partner in resolving 
strategic issues, but it also finds itself in a most 
disadvantageous position in terms of the need to observe all the 
necessary ecological and environmental protection safeguards 
during the elimination of the stockpiled weapons. [071142] 
[video shows aerial view of missile test range, test launch, 
computer graphics, debris littering the test range] 
  [071143 thru 071230 -- passage omitted on officer 
describing operations to clean up 16,000 tonnes of debris 
accumulated at the test range] 
  [071231] [Correspondent over video of operation to 
remove nose section from silo, captioned ``RADAR TV''] 
Today Russia is reaping the fruits of the most critical period 
of its military policy when, as a result of cuts in military 
production, it was forced to extend the guaranteed period of 
service of nuclear missiles on alert duty. Consequently, the 
safe service life of 30 percent of these missiles has already 
expired. And another 30 percent will turn into a potential 
nuclear threat in two years' time. Russia is faced with the 
task of scrapping more than 20,000 nuclear munitions by the year 
2000. And since the pace of the salvage process is very slow, 
we may again fall hostages to the nuclear threat, but this time 
because of being incapable of carrying out mass industrial 
salvaging of such a vast quantity of nuclear charges. 
  [071315] The radiation background at the launch 
site is only just above the permissible limit [video shows 
counter reading]. Furthermore, all the operations are 
controlled by several specialists simultaneously. Therefore the 
removal of the nose section at the launch site is by no means 
the most dangerous operation. [071331] [video shows 
operations above ground and detailed view of interior of missile 
silo] 
  [071332 thru 071405 -- passage omitted showing officer 
issuing instructions on safety precautions during nose section 
removal] 
  [071406 thru 071514 -- video shows nose section removal 
operation over largely unintelligible exchanges between 
officers] 
  [071515 thru 071603 -- passage omitted showing

handling and dispatch of nose sections] 
  [071604] [Unit Commander A. Gribov, identified by 
caption earlier, over video of site being guarded by a soldier, 
sign reading ``Mines,'' nose section being loaded onto 
truck] It has to be said that this is by no means the least 
important or worst of our weapons. Fortunately, it has never 
been used in practice. But the tests that were carried out 
showed that both the missile and the warheads are excellent and 
highly effective. [071648] [video shows soldier guarding 
site, nose section being loaded onto a truck, partly over 
sinister music] 
  [071649] [Correspondent over closeup of nose section 
being loaded onto truck] The nuclear nose cone of the SS-18 
missile can carry 10 nuclear warheads. At the moment there is 
nothing to compare with it in the world. 
  This unusual cargo will be carried in this neat truck only 
as 
far as the nearest depot. Before entering the industrial 
salvaging process, it has a difficult journey along worn-out 
Russian roads ahead. [O71713] [video shows warhead being 
loaded, truck on the move] 
  [071714 thru 071741 -- passage omitted showing 
Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of Strategic 
Missile Forces, to camera, on safety regulations governing 
handling and storage of nuclear munitions] 
  [071742] [Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in 
chief of Strategic Missiles Forces, identified by caption 
earlier, over video of missiles on railroad platforms in a 
siding in snowy location] We have established two bases for 
scrapping missiles, the Surovatikha base, and Pibanshur near the 
city of Izhevsk. [O71805] [video shows missiles in 
railroad siding, concrete building in the middle distance, 
closeups of missiles on railroad platforms, partly over sinister 
music] 
  [071806] [Correspondent over video of missiles being 
dismantled in large hangar] Pibanshur and Surovatikha are 
Russia's first bases for scrapping ICBM's using resource-saving 
technologies. Following the removal of the dangerous fuel 
components, each SS-17 and SS-18 missile will be carefully 
dismantled. In this way the Surovatikha base will be able to 
scrap more than 40 heavy missiles a year. This means that 
thousands of tonnes of expensive metals and alloys will be 
returned to industry. 
  As is known, the previous class of missiles -- intermediate- 
and shorter-range missiles -- were scrapped by means of 
explosions. To the general amazement of our compatriots, 
billions of rubles were turned into ashes and smoke, quite apart 
from the damage that was done to the environment. This is why 
the two new enterprises -- which, incidentally, have been set up 
by the missile forces themselves within their department -- 
unquestionably mark a long-overdue step toward savings of state 
resources spent on disarmament. 
  For the time being inadequate funding is hampering the 
entire 
federal program for recycling ecologically dangerous materials 
from scrapped weapons. The Surovatikha base could make up this 
shortage of funds through the sale of part of the salvaged 
materials to other enterprises for processing. But the latter 
do not have any money either. 
  While a search for coordinated action by the ministries and 
departments interested in industrial recycling is under way at 
the top, the missile men have to bear the full burden of this 
work themselves. [072009] [video shows detailed views of 
salvage operation with camera switching back to railroad siding 
at the end] 
  [072010 thru 072415 -- passage omitted on brief 
statements to camera by Volkov on safety regulations, START I 
and II provisions; video of silo being blown up with 
correspondent describing the economic disadvantages of this 
treaty obligation] 
  [072416] [Correspondent over video of an SS-18 on a 
truck, followed by computer graphics, captioned ``RADAR-TV'' and 
``Voyen TV''] To replace the multiple reentry vehicle 
missiles which are being scrapped, Russia is planning to build 
another multiple-warhead missile [mnogoblochnaya raketa] based 
on the SS-25. However, as distinct from the heavy SS-18 
missile, the new missile cannot be guaranteed to penetrate the 
opponent's anti-missile defenses, since the SS-18 was capable of 
releasing, in addition to its 10 warheads, up to 1,000 false 
targets into orbit. Scientists at the Moscow Heat Technology 
Institute intend to make up for this forced minus-point in the 
design of the nose section of the new missile by making these 
missiles easily reequipable into the ``Start'' system which can 
be used for launches for scientific purposes either right now or 
in the event of arms reduction. Admittedly, the engineers and 
designers will have to find the money to further develop this 
project themselves in order to preserve the scientific potential 
of Russia's only institute of this kind. [072540] [video 
shows computer graphics demonstrating new missile, brief shot of 
interior of scientific institute, mockup of ``Start'' 
system] 
  [072541 thru 072800 -- passage omitted on brief 
interview with Boris Lagutin, general designer, talking in 
general terms about the quality of Russian missile design; brief 
outline by correspondent of tripartite agreement between Russia, 
United States, and Ukraine over unspecified military 
facilities]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, Feb 1 TASS -- Reports claiming Russia has 
turned into ``grounds for dumping dangerous industrial waste 
from Western nations are unjustified,'' says a statement of the 
Russian Environment Ministry's press service circulated here 
today in response to a document of the Russian Greenpeace 
division ``Russia: Dumping Grounds for Western Waste.'' 
  The ministry admitted a tendency of dangerous waste imports 
but said it prepares measures to prevent the threat. 
  According to the Greenpeace report, there have been 96 
attempts to bring to Russia 34 million tones of waste within six 
years. Specialists believe these were mere intentions. 
  In the words of the ministry, the Russian procedure of 
industrial waste imports and exports ``prevents imports of large 
batches of dangerous waste to Russia.'' The Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations issues licenses and the Russian state 
customs committee controls the waste imports. A license is 
issued on coordination with the environment ministry; the latter 
provide for a corresponding examination. 
  The procedure is obligatory for all, and its violation 
entails administrative and criminal responsibility. 
  According to the ministry, territorial environmental bodies 
have rejected the overwhelming majority of proposals of Western 
firms and their Russian mediators on the basis of expert 
conclusions. In 1992-1993 they coordinated licenses on imports 
of small batches of industrial waste, as a rule, for research 
purposes. 
  In order to prevent illegal attempts of dangerous waste 
imports, the ministry works in close contact with the 
law-enforcement and environment bodies of several states.

  [Text] About half of Russia's population uses water which 
does not meet drinking standards. Two thirds of the towns in 
the country have no central water supply system and in some 
regions the drinking water situation ``requires urgent 
measures,'' due to threat of ``irreversible consequences.'' 
This was stated by Vice Premier Alexander Zaveryukha, in charge 
of agrarian issues, environmental protection and natural 
resources, at a meeting of the Collegium of the Russian 
Federation's Committee for the Water Supply Industry on Tuesday. 
  According to Zaveryukha, the Russian Federation still has no 
program on supplying the population with drinking water, while 
as a result of ``the continuous mass pollution, two-thirds of 
man-made water sources do not meet the requirements for drinking 
and fishing reservoirs,'' and the construction of water supply 
networks ``has been sharply falling in recent years.'' 
  The vice premier pointed out that the Russian government 
intends ``to give up inefficient administrative command methods 
of protecting water resources.'' A water supply fee should be 
introduced and the parliament should consider and pass the 
project already submitted by experts ``The Basics of the Water 
Legislation of the Russian Federation.'' 
  Zaveryukha believes that in all industries without exception 
it is necessary ``to more actively pass to economic relations 
between the state and the users of natural resources.'' In his 
opinion, the first step in that direction was the introduction 
of considerable penalties for the pollution of the environment.

  [Text] Today's briefing at the General Staff of the Navy 
was devoted to the Navy's nuclear safety. Rear Admiral Yurasov, 
head of the Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, said that nuclear and 
radiation safety norms were revised after the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. According to Yurasov, these norms are being 
observed in the majority of atomic installations, atomic subs, 
and ships. 
  [Begin Yurasov recording] Considerable financial 
means are required to maintain the operation of these atomic 
subs. These atomic subs are a potential source of radiological 
contamination. [end recording] 
  A serious shortage of personnel to man nuclear installations 
is another problem of the Navy. There are not enough sailors, 
warrant officers, and officers. Touching upon the issue of 
sunken submarines--specifically, the Komsomolets sub--it was 
noted that it would be more expedient to mothball rather than 
raise them. The radioactive contamination around the 
Komsomolets is local and does not represent an ecological 
disaster. The marines do not regard as necessary the 
Gosatomnadzor's [Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] supervision of certain installations; they believe that 
departmental monitoring of the Navy's nuclear safety is 
sufficient. 
  [Begin V. Makarov, deputy director of 
Gosatomnadzor] What they are proposing runs counter to the 
approved amendments introduced in the provision on 
Gosatomnadzor. These amendment were agreed upon with the chief 
of the General Staff, and I cannot change the list of 
installations to be monitored. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 17 (TASS) -- Phased out nuclear-powered 
Russian submarines may pose a radiological threat, Rear Admiral 
Nikolay Yurasov, head of the Inspectorate for the Nuclear Safety 
of Nuclear Power Units under the Russian Defence Ministry, said 
at a press conference today. 
  According to Yurasov, the submarines whose service life is 
over were made radiologically safe. Measures needed for 
ensuring it continue to be taken. However, much money is needed 
for keeping the submarines afloat, ensuring their stability and 
resistance to flooding. The maintenance of phased out 
nuclear-powered ships, nuclear reactors and obsolete nuclear 
storage facilities also costs a lot to the Russian Navy. 
  Responding to the question [by] ITAR-TASS, Yurasov did not 
mention the exact amount of money needed for resolving those 
problems and said the figures should be updated. Yurasov 
stressed that in 1992 the government allocated to them only 15 
percent of the money they really need, while in 1993 they did 
not receive anything at all. According to Yurasov, the 
government is pinning its hopes on the federal budget, while 
most local administrations are doing nothing to help the navy 
resolve its financial and ecological problems. 
  In 1993 150 nuclear safety inspections were held at Russian 
nuclear power units, Yurasov continued. Thirty-seven 
instructions were issued for carrying out work which is 
dangerous from the radiological point of view. On the whole, no 
radiologicaly dangerous situations or conditions for them were 
registered at the nuclear power units of the Russian Navy in 
1993. ``Safety is being fully ensured at all nuclear power 
units,'' Yurasov stressed.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0840 GMT on 19 February broadcasts 
an ecological program ``People's Earth,'' which carries a 
10-minute feature on the continuing investigation into the 
sinking of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine on 7 April 1989 in 
the Norwegian Sea near Medvezhiy island. Video shows nuclear 
submarine in Arctic waters, investigating expedition with 
underwater apparatus, clips and stills of Komsomolets on the 
seabed, interviews with officials 
  ``The Komsomolets is not the first nuclear submarine to 
suffer an accident but it is the first whose nuclear reactor has 
leaked.'' 
  However, as has become known, thanks to research carried out 
by Russian shore-based scientists, the reactor does not pose a 
serious ecological threat. The aim of the latest expedition by 
the Committee for Conducting Special Purpose Submarine Work 
[KOPRON] -- which has kindly given our program exclusive rights 
to show its video material -- was to assess the situation 
concerning the warheads. If plutonium escapes into the sea it 
could cause serious ecological danger. 
  ``The latest data from the chemical analysis taken from 
around the plutonium warheads is not comforting. KOPRON is 
being disbanded and so are the mobile structures carrying out 
active preparations for the conservation of warheads on the 
Komsomolets.''

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 15 TASS -- Some 20,000 violations of 
nuclear safety were registered in 1993 by the Russian state 
inspection for nuclear and radiation safety. 
  The inspection visited 14,500 Russian enterprises using 
nuclear materials or radioactive substances. The extreme 
measure of enterprise halt was used 78 times, Inspection 
Chairman Yuriy Vishnevskiy told a news conference here today. 
  As for nine nuclear power plants with 29 power units, there 
were no accidents related to melting of the reactor active zone 
and discharge of considerable amount of radioactive substances 
into the atmosphere, same as big fires with the exception of 
several spontaneous fires and smoking up. 
  A total of 38 percent of accidents at nuclear power plants 
happened through the fault of personnel, a considerable amount 
of violations is related to malfunction of equipment and system 
elements. 
  A major reason for nuclear safety violations is the lack of 
money. The nuclear branch was the only Russian one that 
preserved its output in 1993, but it fails to receive payment 
for electricity consumption. In the words of Vishnevskiy, the 
Russian Ministry of Finance did not allocate a single ruble in 
1993 to raise safety of nuclear power plants. The 1994 planned 
allocations of 114 billion rubles will hardly be received as 
well. 
  Another problem is the lack of corresponding legislation. 
Russia is the world's only state that does not have laws on the 
use of nuclear energy and state policy on treatment of 
radioactive waste. Draft documents were kept by the former 
Supreme Soviet for 18 months, but no decision were taken. 
  Due to the absence of legislative acts, the inspectors 
cannot 
invoke efficient economic sanctions against violators of nuclear 
safety. Today's fine for violation of nuclear safety rules by 
an individual is 100 rubles (six cents).

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 15 -- The Japanese Embassy in Moscow 
reported today that the meeting of the commission of experts 
from Russia, Japan, and South Korea which took place in 
Vladivostok has worked out a detailed plan for carrying out a 
joint trilateral expedition to study areas of the Sea of Japan 
where radioactive waste has been discharged. The plan of the 
expedition has been drawn up in accordance with the decisions 
adopted during the Japanese-Russian summit meeting and at the 
second meeting of the Japanese-Russian working group in October 
and November last year. 
  In the period from 15 April to 14 May 1994 the expedition, 
with the participation of specialists from Russia, Japan, South 
Korea, and an International Atomic Energy Agency representative 
will visit seven regions of the Sea of Japan in which it has 
been established that discharges of waste previously took place.

  [Text] The Pacific Fleet's liquid nuclear wastes (LNW) will 
be safely stored or processed before the end of 1994. Nikolay 
Bisovko, a senior official in the Federal Supervision of Nuclear 
and Radioactive Security, who looks after the safety of nuclear 
power plants used by the country's defense agencies, told 
Interfax that a mobile LNW processing unit would be built in the 
Maritime Territory at a cost of 1.2 Bn [billion] rubles. ``We 
believe that it will be assembled in three to four months and 
become operational in 1994,'' he said. 
  He added that a stationary processing unit had to be 
constructed in the area. The unit will need filters and other 
parts that will have to be manufactured in numerous factories. 
  Bisovko thinks said that an ecological study would precede 
the construction of stationary LNW processing units. It was 
hard to say at this stage how much time and funds would be 
required for that project.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vasyutin, deputy head of the Tula </F>
Oblast administration, conducted by Igor Filimonov: ``Experiment 
on the Scale of the Country''] 
  [Text] An interdepartmental organizational and 
coordinating council on the environment has been established. 
Behind the unwieldy name lies an environmental experiment that 
has been conducted in Tula Oblast. It was approved by the 
Russian government, which decided to back it up with the 
participation of various ministries and committees. The council 
is supposed to unite their efforts. Rarely has such a 
broad-scale program of change come from a region, rather than 
from the central government. That is why Sergey Vasyutin, deputy 
head of the Tula Oblast administration, has been made head of 
the interdepartmental council. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent 
got in touch with him by phone. 
  Filimonov: Why was it in your oblast that it was 
decided to conduct the experiment? 
  Vasyutin: Tula Oblast has the most highly stressed 
environmental situation in Russia. The level of pollution by 
industrial waste is high. Seventeen percent of the drinking 
water does not meet health standards. The consequences of the 
Chernobyl accident are having a strong impact. Just 14 percent 
of the children lack health abnormalities. But there is a 
powerful research base in the oblast for studying the impact of 
environmental pollution on human health. A unique set of methods 
for monitoring the human environment and a system for the early 
diagnosis of diseases have been developed by Oleg Martynov, a 
professor at Tula University. Moreover, our administration was 
stubbornly persistent and got approval at the highest level for 
a program for improvement of condition of the environment. More 
than 3,000 proposals have already been received from scientists 
and entire research institutes. The interdepartmental council 
(and it includes the Russian Academy of Sciences Vice-President 
Frolov; Academy of Medical Sciences President Pokrovskiy; 
Danilov-Danilyan, the minister of the environment; and Sokolov, 
chief physician of the Sanitation and Epidemiological 
Inspectorate) will develop a normative and legal basis for 
carrying out environmental reforms in Russia. 
  Filimonov: I know that not everything went 
smoothly with the program, especially with its financing. Do you 
think that such powerful support will help break down any 
fortresses? 
  Vasyutin: We spent 18 months trying to get 
approval for the program in the ministries. But even when there 
are directives by Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin ordering the money to 
be appropriated, lower-level bureaucrats easily rescind them. At 
the last moment, thanks to Danilov-Danilyan, I managed to return 
the program to the list of federal financing. The Ministry of 
Finance had written it off as lacking promise. References to the 
country's leaders have not helped. The clerks simply brush them 
aside: ``We have a lot of such instructions. We've gotten used 
to them.'' 
  Filimonov: Environmental protection is often 
associated with emergencies, but for some reason there is no 
representative on the council of the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations. Why is this? 
  Vasyutin: We have relations that have already been 
set up. The methods proposed by Martynov not only presuppose an 
automatic tracking of any increase in the level of pollution, 
but make it possible to predict emergency situations. An 
automated monitoring system has already been put into operation 
at Yasnaya Polyana. The only instructional-methods center in the 
country for training environmental-protection specialists has 
been established on the basis of the civil defense system. We 
are planning to create a special curriculum for schoolchildren 
called ``Island of Survival'' in which we will prepare students 
for action under emergency conditions. 
  Filimonov: The council, by bringing together the 
representatives of several ministries and committees, is 
seemingly going planning to break down departmental barriers and 
attract scientist-practitioners from all branches of science. 
  Vasyutin: That is our dream, We will enlist 
scientists only on a contractual basis and will reject the use 
of huge institutes that require immense amounts of money to 
support their administrators. A doctor of sciences working for 
us will receive not 50,000 rubles, as one does at the present 
time, but several times that amount. Money from the sale to the 
West of our technological developments for the processing of 
waste will also belong to the developers. 
  Filimonov: Sale to the West? But we have already 
gotten used to the idea that our technologies are the most 
unadvanced. 
  Vasyutin: It is simply that no one has heard about 
a lot of them. In Germany our specialists demonstrated 
calculations pertaining to the development of a unit for 
extracting gasoline and diesel fuel from waste rubber. Western 
scientists were convinced that such a thing was not even 
theoretically possible. But the Platonov pilot unit is operating 
in Tula. If we are able to implement the environmental program, 
Russia will be able to get the opportunity to assume an equal 
footing with the other countries of Europe and America.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Yablokov: ``Who is on the Green </F>
Platform? Comparative Analysis of the Ecology Sections of Party 
and Block Electoral Platforms''] 
  [Text] It often happened before that deputies elected to 
the agencies of state power on the basis of ecological slogans 
soon forgot about them. Today the situation must change, since 
now the responsibility for fulfilling such promises is borne by 
a specific political party or association, which in the not too 
distant future will once again have to turn to the voters for 
support in the next elections. Our task is not to allow 
the politicians to forget their ecological promises. 
Therefore, it is rather important specifically now to recall and 
analyze the ecology sections of the pre-election platforms. 
  In the programs of the ``Future of Russia--New Names'' 
block, 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the Communist 
Party of Russia, sections on ecological policy or program 
proposals on the resolution of ecological problems have been 
absent altogether. The programs of the ``Women of Russia'' 
movement and the ``Dignity and Charity'' block contained only a 
few fragmentary statements of the most general nature. The most 
complete representation of Russia's ecological problems appears 
in the programs of the constructive-ecological movement 
``Kedr,'' ``Choice of Russia'' and the 
``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' block (``Yabloko''). 
  By its broadness of scope in encompassing political problems 
in the sphere of ecology, ``Kedr,'' is, of course, in first 
place. Second is ``Choice of Russia,'' third--the ``Party for 
Russian Unity and Accord'' (PRES), and fourth--``Yabloko.'' In 
terms of the depth of economic development of ecological 
problems, the priority undoubtedly goes to PRES, while the other 
three places are shared by ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Yabloko'' and 
``Kedr.'' In terms of the detailed nature of development of 
specific problems presented in the pre-election platforms, the 
leaders are ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Kedr'' and the Agrarian 
Party of Russia. 
  We must say that the problem of the economic mechanism of 
regulating the activity of ecologically hazardous industries and 
natural resource utilization has gained greatest recognition 
among this group of political parties and movements. Five 
parties and movements have included some kind of declaration to 
this effect in their platforms. Four parties and movements have 
included demands on compensation of ecological loss and rational 
utilization of nonrenewable natural resources in their 
platforms. Three parties have declared the need for tightening 
procedures for ecological expert analysis of all projects, 
programs and decisions by agencies of state power and 
administration, and three parties have a program of first 
priority measures in the field of ecology. 
  On the whole, however, analysis shows that none of those who 
aspire to the State Duma of Russia from the all-federal 
electoral district have presented a sufficiently comprehensive 
program for the ecological revitalization of Russia. Even if we 
put together all the announced positions, all the questions of 
ecology raised in all the pre-election platforms, they would 
still not reflect in full measure the ecological problems facing 
Russia. We get the impression that the ecological sections of 
all the parties and movements were hastily written and weakly 
developed. I must conclude with disappointment that the deputies 
who have gained membership in the State Duma according to the 
party lists will not be able to provide objective and in-depth 
solutions to the ecological problems facing the country. We may 
only hope that the deputies coming to the State Duma from 
regions for which the state of the environment is not a purely 
theoretical question, but a most vital one, will be able to 
correct the legislative activity of the parliament in the sphere 
of ecology. 
  An analysis of the presence of ecologists among the 
candidates for deputy in the State Duma presented by party lists 
also allows us to make certain curious observations. We will 
note that under such an analysis, ecologists were considered to 
be not only those candidates who actually called themselves 
ecologists, but also biologists, glaciologists, and specialists 
having a higher education in the field of natural sciences. With 
such a broad approach, it turned out that, within the voting 
list of ``Kedr,'' 45 percent of the candidates for deputy could 
be called ecologists. However, unfortunately this movement found 
itself outside the bounds of the State Duma. Second in the 
number of ecologists was the ``Dignity and Charity'' movement, 
with almost 14 percent. But, alas, it too was unable to bring 
its representatives to parliament. In third place was 
``Yabloko,'' with almost 6 percent of the candidates for deputy 
who could be called ecologists. In the ``Women of Russia'' 
movement, 5 percent of the candidates for deputy could be called 
ecologists, in ``Choice of Russia''--4 percent, in the RDDR 
[Russian Movement for Democratic Reform]--3 percent, in the 
PRES--2 percent, in the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]--1 
percent, and among the agrarians and the LDPR--less than one 
percent. In last place were the communists, whose electoral list 
did not contain a single person who could be called an ecologist. 
  A comparison of these data with the analysis of the 
pre-election platforms of the parties and movements allows us to 
draw certain conclusions. As we have already stated, ``Kedr,'' 
``Choice of Russia,'' and PRES had more or less well-developed 
ecological programs. However, by the number of ecologists 
presented in the electoral lists, PRES is only in eighth place, 
while ``Choice of Russia'' is in fifth place. Thus, despite the 
notable presence of ecologists in the other electoral blocks, 
this did not sufficiently influence the development of 
ecological problems in the pre-election programs of the blocks. 
This may indicate either a random selection of candidates for 
deputy, or an insufficient participation of these candidates for 
deputy in the preparation of the pre-election platforms of their 
parties and movements.

  [Text] On December 29 the President of Russia signed a 
decree on the resignation of Alexei Yablokov, adviser for 
ecology. 
  ``I have resigned at my own will,'' Alexei Yablokov told an 
MN correspondent. ``I have not seen the President in over six 
months. Besides, there is much talk about the abolition of the 
office of advisers. Why should I wait? I shall work at the 
Security Council. Meanwhile, the ecological situation in Russia, 
as most experts admit, is now close to disastrous.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitry Litvinov, coordinator of the </F>
Greenpeace of Russia organization, by Dmitry Ukhlin: 
``Greenpeace: We Will Work With Any Party''] 
  [Text] Q.: What event marked the start of 
Greenpeace's involvement in Russia? 
  A.: In the USSR we began in Kiev with the Children of 
Chernobyl project. In 1990 our vessel sailed to Novaya Zemlya to 
protest against nuclear testing. At that time we were held in 
custody for more than two weeks. The second time we sailed there 
was last year to document the Russian Navy's dumping of nuclear 
waste and spent reactors from nuclear submarines in the sea. Our 
boat was arrested and our ship Solo was fired on and captured, 
moreover, in international waters. We were again held in custody 
for a week. As a result, a governmental commission was formed 
under the chairmanship of Alexei Yablokov, adviser to the 
President on matters of ecology. We secured what we wanted to 
achieve. Today, Greenpeace of Russia stands already quite firmly 
on its feet. 
  Q.: Whose money does Greenpeace owe its existence 
to? 
  A.: The system of our financing took final shape in the 
mid-1980s. We take no money either from governments and private 
companies or from any funds whatsoever. Individual donations 
account for 99 percent of Greenpeace's money and 1 percent comes 
from the sale of T-shirts and souvenirs. Every national 
organization, collecting individual donations in its own 
country, allots 22 percent for Greenpeace International. This 
money is distributed among the others, mainly those who are just 
beginning their work and do not yet have considerable funds of 
their own as in Japan, for example. Or else it is apportioned 
for large-scale international acts--today the biggest of them is 
under way in Britain where we want to close down the Thor 
factory used for recycling nuclear weapons. Huge sums have been 
allotted for this purpose, and victory is already just around 
the corner. 
  Q.: What are Greenpeace's priorities in Russia? 
  A.: We protest against the production of plutonium in the 
course of recycling used nuclear fuel. In general, nuclear power 
engineering is a threat for the whole world, not only for the 
inhabitants of areas adjacent to nuclear power plants. 
  Q.: In other countries Greenpeace is fighting against 
the dumping of toxic wastes. They are taken to Russia--and here 
Greenpeace doesn't let them in. Am I right? 
  A.: Quite right. We want to make sure that there should be 
no 
toxic waste in general. And this is quite feasible as technical 
ways to solving the problem already exist. 
  Q.: It is impossible to carry out serious ecological 
work in a country without getting in touch directly with its 
power structures. How does it take place in Russia? 
  A.: We are continuously working with the authorities. And, 
while not being a political organization, we secure any 
ecological victory we can at a political level. We worked with 
the Supreme Soviet and we will also work with the new structures 
in all the regions. If a person responsible for the adoption of 
one or another bill does not listen to our arguments, there is a 
need for recourse to pressure--through the press or from among 
that person's constituents. But for me it is absolutely 
unimportant what political views this or that deputy may have. 
  We are delighted by the Constitution's adoption because 
presidential power has been very weak in responding to our 
actions. This is particularly visible in the localities where 
the governor appointed from Moscow has absolutely no idea about 
local problems and is not interested in their solution--in 
contrast to the now dissolved local Soviets. However bad they 
might have been, they were closer to the region's population. 
  Q.: The following opinion of your organization exists: 
Greenpeace is good, of course, they are young enthusiasts, but 
they are often drawn into not altogether clean games, being used 
either in rival ``settlements'' or in politics. How do you 
respond to this? 
  A.: Well, of course, in America Greenpeace is a ``hand of 
the 
KGB'' and in the USSR it used to be a ``hand of the CIA.'' In 
Sweden we are in general a ``hand'' of both the KGB and the CIA 
simultaneously. All this is rubbish. In this organization I have 
never encountered dependence on any political or economic 
situation whatsoever. Russia's Ministry of the Nuclear Power 
Industry says, for example, that Greenpeace wants to close 
Russian nuclear power plants in favour of German ones. For those 
who know how hard we have ``worked'' on German atomic power 
stations this is simply ridiculous. 
  Q.: And the last question: what is the biggest headache 
for Greenpeace today? 
  A.: The ozone hole. The latest information from American 
satellites is such that in 1993 it has increased more than was 
predicted. No way out has yet been found. For the time being we 
are not working on this issue in Russia although its 
``contribution'' to the problem is enormous.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS </F>
comment] 
  [Text] A string of barges hauled along by a mighty tugboat 
is now icebound in the lower reaches of the Amur. 
  The vessels frozen in the middle of the river threaten an 
ecological catastrophe, not only in the lower Amur but all along 
the great Far Eastern river, because the barges carry tons of 
toxic chemicals destined for use in some technical operations at 
the Mnogovershynnyi ore-dressing plant. 
  At the start of the navigation season some local inept 
``managers'' dispatched the caravan from Komsomolsk-on-Amur to 
Nikolayevsk, on a long trip down the river, unmindful of the 
consequences. As we know, the expedition never reached its 
destination, finding itself stuck in ice. Ecologists insist that 
the hazardous cargo must immediately be removed from the river. 
But in order to do this, it is necessary to lay a winter road to 
the barges from the settlement of Mnogovershynnyi that would 
span 200 km and stretch across ice-covered bogs and ice hummocks 
on numerous smaller rivers. The project will require a lot of 
machinery and quite some time. Special motor vehicles will have 
to be laid on to evacuate the toxic reagents. The locals are not 
yet ready to mount this kind of large-scale rescue operation. 
Meanwhile, residents of coastal settlements have started 
``appropriating'' the cargoes, according to a time-honoured 
Russian custom, in the belief that they can come in useful in 
the household. A goodly proportion of the hazardous load is 
already scattered across Amur ice and coated with snow banks and 
drifts. In the spring all that will find its way into the river 
which until recently was believed to have the world's largest 
fish population. Today the Amur is in the fourth category of the 
water pollution table for major rivers which means its waters 
cannot be used, and much, less, consumed by man.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, minister of </F>
environmental protection and natural resources, under the 
heading ``Satisfaction'': ``Response to Persistent Critics: `No 
Normal Economy Can Be Built Without a Normal Environment'''] 
  [Text] My interview in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (No 251 (675), 
30 December 1993) drew an extremely emotional reaction from A. 
V. Yablokov, the chairman of the Security Council's Interagency 
Commission on Ecological Safety (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 13 January 
1994). Neither I nor anyone else in the environmental protection 
system was surprised at that reaction -- we have long since 
become accustomed to Aleksey Vladimirovich's incompetence and 
emotional outbursts. But I do feel compelled to write to the 
newspaper again because that incompetence caused the distortion 
of certain facts that are quite obvious or else easily 
verifiable, as well as incorrect and subjective interpretation 
of other facts and such exaggeration that the likelihood of 
readers being misinformed is simply too great to ignore. 
  Provisionally -- but only provisionally -- one could divide 
Yablokov's ``response'' into three section: firstly, a 
description of Russia's ``terrible'' environmental problems, 
secondly, a tale of how the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources, deprived of Mr. Yablokov's skillful 
leadership, either cannot or will not function and, finally a 
third section containing assertions of a political nature which 
clearly reek of denunciation. 
  Let us begin with the most simple fact, and the thing that 
evidently enrages my opponent most of all: my election as deputy 
to the State Duma. I was elected on a slate of candidates from 
the Russia's Choice association, and I was elected in Nizhegorod 
Electoral District, because the association's slate was divided 
up into geographical districts, in full compliance with the 
Election Statute. I did not lose anywhere. Nor did I attempt to 
register anywhere except in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  So why did Yablokov not even bother to inquire of the 
Central 
Elections Committee exactly how I got elected? And along those 
same lines, what does the word ``self-appointment'' in the final 
paragraph of his article mean? Could it be that Yablokov thinks 
I appointed myself minister? One thing is clear: that kind of 
mistake is impermissible not only for a politician, but for any 
state official, even one who stands apart from politics (though 
at one time Yablokov was active in politics and served as a USSR 
people's deputy). 
  Now let us turn to ecology and begin with organizational and 
administrative matters. Unfortunately, at this time it is by no 
means just the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources that is responsible for the 
environment, the state of natural resources and natural resource 
use in Russia. In addition to it there are at least 11 other 
federal agencies dealing with those matters, and six of those 
organizations (the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing, the 
Ministry of Agriculture's Hunting Department, Russian Federal 
Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, Russian Federal 
Mining and Industrial Oversight and the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight) have always 
been wholly independent of the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources. Yet Yablokov holds me 
accountable for all of them. 
  When I talk about the results of our efforts, about our 
problems, the means of solving them and our capabilities, in the 
first approximation I am referring to a framework established by 
current legislative acts. In addition one must also take into 
account the actual social and economic situation in the country, 
the things that society will agree to do and the things that it 
plainly will not accept at this time. Things are very 
comfortable when the GNP is rising and the centrally distributed 
portion thereof is increasing -- in that case everyone can be 
allocated a little bit more, and high-priority areas 
(environmental protection, for example) can be given more than 
anyone else. But if the amount of money being distributed is not 
growing, then one area can only receive something at the expense 
of another (for example, the pension fund, health care services, 
education, science, culture, etc.). It is even worse when the 
GNP and the centrally distributed portion thereof are 
decreasing. In that case the amount of funding received by each 
section of the state's budget also decreases, and in order to 
increase allocations in one area it is necessary to impoverish 
other areas even more. Add to that the fact that they are 
already losing money due to the worsening economic situation. 
One must have exceptionally high priority in the eyes of society 
to get additional funding under these conditions. But of course 
Yablokov is aware that the declining standard of living, higher 
crime rates, unemployment, political problems stemming from the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and many other things have 
relegated environmental protection to a place of very low 
priority in public opinion. Under these conditions one must look 
at things realistically and ask for whatever society is willing 
to give. Even if that means taking a purely market-oriented 
position and framing the issue like this: what is better in 
terms of improvement in the environment's priority ranking -- 
constant performance of requiems, or reasoning and information 
based on the actual functioning of the environmental protection 
system? I am convinced that the latter is better. Yablokov 
writes: ``...budgetary funding for the field is such that the 
entire Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection system is on 
the verge of collapse.'' As for collapse, that is an outright 
lie, and just show me anyone whose budgetary funding situation 
is any better! Without the slightest effort I could name 15 
ministries and agencies where things are worse. 
  If the environmental situation were catastrophically bad 
throughout the entire territory of Russia that would be a death 
sentence for all of humanity. It is strange that Yablokov has 
somehow overlooked the biosphere as a whole and the role played 
in it by our ``golden ecological reserve'' -- the more than 
one-third of Russia's territory that remains virtually untouched 
by commercial activity (7-8 million square kilometers). 
Fortunately, overall this is not yet a catastrophe, it is a 
problem, and one which can and should be solved. 
  One must not forget that 30 years ago an extremely severe 
environmental situation was observed in many regions of Europe, 
the United States and Japan. The situation there often coincided 
exactly with what we are currently seeing, primarily in 
metal-manufacturing cities, in Baykalsk and in industrial 
centers in the Urals and the Volga region. The post-industrial 
countries have solved this problem, though one must admit that 
they have done so largely at the expense of the Third World (and 
the world at large). I am convinced that we will also solve it, 
and we will attempt to do so not at anyone else's expense, using 
our own scientific and technical resources, instead of exporting 
environment-intensive types of production abroad. I have written 
on many occasions about the fact that that process could begin 
in Russia together with an economic upturn, that solutions to 
the problems of the economy and the environment must be 
implemented simultaneously, that introduction of the new 
technologies that will allow our economy to lower its overhead 
and improve its product quality and competitiveness on the world 
market will at the same time make it possible to achieve radical 
changes in the interaction between the economy and nature. No, 
there is no way to build a normal economy without a normal 
environment. But equally pointless is the position that says 
first the environment, then the economy. What is needed here is 
calm calculation, persistent day-to-day efforts to assess and 
monitor compliance with decisions, environmental inspection, 
further development of the economic mechanism for environmental 
protection and natural resource use (which even now is 
functioning just fine) improvement of the tax system, and 
development of environmental protection legislation. To many 
people that seems pretty boring, and most of these are things 
you would not talk about at a demonstration, for example, but 
the future of our environment and the ecological health of our 
country will depend primarily on these efforts. 
  I am surprised by the number of scientific errors constantly 
made by Yablokov. In what scientific source did he read that 
there is an ozone hole over the Northern Hemisphere, and over 
Russia in particular? Over the Antarctic -- yes, there is, or 
rather there is a hole that appears and disappears depending on 
seasonal variations. But the only thing that has been recorded 
over the Northern Hemisphere is a depletion of the ozone layer 
-- fortunately we still have a long way to go before we have a 
hole. The causes of this extremely unpleasant phenomenon did not 
come about in just the past three to five years. Large-scale 
production of ozone layer-destroying chlorofluorocarbons goes 
back several decades, and many of them continue to ``live'' in 
the atmosphere. The effects of those that are already there will 
only cease several decades from now. Yet reading that particular 
passage in Yablokov's article the uninformed reader could well 
think that the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection has 
through its bungling created an ozone hole in the past two 
years. Things that can be forgiven an environmentalist speaker 
addressing a rally are unpardonable coming from a corresponding 
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, just as they are 
unpardonable coming from a high-level government official. 
  Or consider this excerpt: ``Since the state of the 
environment is responsible for roughly 30 percent of our health, 
one year out of the three years of decrease in average life 
expectance in 1993 is due to the environment.'' But just what is 
``30 percent of our health?'' After declaring rates of illness a 
health factor, Yablokov draws this astounding conclusion: since 
roughly a third of the reported illness rate is attributable to 
the environmental factor -- according to him -- then 
consequently for every three years of decline in life expectancy 
one year is due to that factor. How can one respond to that? 
Doctors are well aware that disease rates are not so simply and 
directly connected with life expectancy, especially if one 
considers only reported illnesses based on hospital records (as 
is done in virtually every study). 
  Yablokov seems very prone to mistake his claims for the 
final 
authority on truth. In his opinion, the minister ``delayed for 
more than a year the development of a system of measures 
stemming from the decisions by the U.N. Conference on 
Sustainable Development signed by Russia in Rio de Janeiro.'' It 
is a well-known fact that those decisions were signed by more 
than 150 countries of the world, and I would like for Yablokov 
to name me even five that have approved any such systems of 
measures at the governmental level. The Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection in conjunction with other affected 
ministries and agencies has in fact submitted a draft plan to 
the government. Yablokov leveled the same charge at me at a 
meeting of the government's commission on environmental 
protection and natural resource use but, as is his custom, did 
not stay until the end and left the meeting before I was able to 
reply. For that reason he remains ignorant of the arbitrary 
nature of his assessment. 
  The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection complies 
with all legal standards, laws and sublegal acts and cannot, as 
an organ of state executive authority, operate in any other way. 
At the start of this letter, addressing the ministry's tasks, 
functions and rights, I wrote: ``in the first approximation.'' 
The second approximation clearly is to consciously and 
purposefully change guidelines that do not satisfy the 
environmental protection system, based on consideration of 
principle and an overall scientific assessment of our tasks and 
functions. Not to violate the guidelines, but rather to change 
them, acting within the bounds of the law. We are very 
dissatisfied with the current ``Statute on the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources'' and have 
prepared a new version. We have gotten approval for it from all 
ministries and agencies and we are now waiting for government 
approval, but unfortunately due to the government's 
reorganization that approval has been delayed. We are in many 
ways dissatisfied with the current law ``On Environmental 
Protection,'' but the we have prepared a draft of a new federal 
law to be entitled ``On Environmental Protection and Sustainable 
Development'' and are ready to submit it to the State Duma in 
the near future. True, if it were not for the parliamentary 
crisis we would have done so months earlier. All of this adds up 
to not very favorable conditions surrounding the ministry, but I 
am not inclined to keep count of our defeats, otherwise one 
would have to regard the entire history of any ministry as an 
unbroken series of defeats. These are just difficulties, the 
kind that are quite normal for any aspect of government work and 
for any ministry or agency. We do not overly dramatize the 
situation. We are doing our jobs. Incidentally, a brief report 
on our work is included in the state reports I have already 
mentioned, and is submitted to the government on a monthly 
basis, in addition to our annual report. Yablokov should be 
familiar with all these materials, it just seems that he has no 
interest in them. 
  Now a word about the All-Russian Congress on Ecology and 
Environmental Protection. This is definitely a useful idea, and 
the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection has been an 
active supporter of it from the start. But convening a congress 
without any preparatory work would be absolutely pointless. 
Major organizational preparations are required. Nor will a 
program for Russia's ecological revival come about by itself. It 
will have to be developed. All that takes money, people to do 
the work and an appropriate organization. At a board meeting of 
the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection this matter was 
considered in the presence of Yablokov, who stated that he 
wanted to be head of the organizing committee that would 
organize the congress. The embarrassed board members said 
nothing, and no decision as to who should be assigned to head 
the organizational committee was made at that time. Firstly, it 
is a well-known fact that in other countries such events are 
usually headed by the president, the vice-president or the prime 
minister, not by an advisor. Secondly, Yablokov does not have 
any substantial apparatus supporting him, and that means the 
whole organizational burden would fall on the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection. We are also very familiar with 
Yablokov's leadership style, and we were simply horrified at the 
prospect. The Russian delegation to the Rio conference was 
headed, not too successfully, by A. V. Rutskoy, whose status 
would be fully appropriate for the head of an organizing 
committee. As for the assertion that I need ``political 
closeness to Rutskoy,'' that statement could only elicit 
laughter from anyone who has the slightest familiarity with the 
issue. Incidentally, in terms of the ``mournful tone'' of his 
environmental speeches A. V. Rutskoy has always been very close 
to A. V. Yablokov. There is a great deal of evidence that I have 
never sought political closeness to Rutskoy, and Yablokov 
himself could call some to mind if he would try. Back in the 
fall of 1992 there was no mention of political battles in 
connection with the election or anything else of the kind. As 
for me, I have never betrayed my democratic beliefs and my 
liberal economic concepts, and there is no way that I can regard 
Rutskoy as an ally based either on psychological makeup or 
ideological considerations. As for the assertion that he has no 
use for me whatsoever, I have never had any doubt about that. 
  Where is the environmental program, Yablokov asks? I have 
already mentioned it. It is the document that has been submitted 
for government approval, prepared in accordance with the 
decisions of the U.N. conference in Rio de Janeiro and the 
followup conference on ``The Environment for Europe,'' held in 
Lucerne a year later. The document was completed exactly on 
schedule. As for why ``our government has avoided further 
developing and implementing it,'' that is a question that should 
be addressed to the head of government, not to me. In a 
postscript to his response to me Yablokov states that he intends 
to focus his efforts on the Russian Security Council's 
Interagency Commission on Ecological Safety. Of that commission 
he writes: ``The commission's decisions... are subject to review 
by organs of state authority...'' It is obvious that it is 
precisely authority that attracts A. V. Yablokov, the authority 
to be irresponsible, and that has always been his position: he 
has monitored and instructed the ministry and sent it almost 
1,000 letters in a year and a half, yet has never been 
accountable for anything. But he has a very dim concept of how 
to use authority. The same is true now: I look at his 
commission's plans and I can see that he will be lucky if 
one-twentieth of them will ever actually come before the 
Security Council. All the rest will be just static, another 
source of annoyance for those who have to implement them, those 
who will once again be issued tens and hundreds of guidelines to 
follow. Though head of the Security Council's Interagency 
Commission, Yablokov is not even clear on how the council 
functions, which issues it considers and what kind of decisions 
it makes. In MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (9-16 January 1994, No 2/699) 
A. V. Yablokov, commenting on his resignation from the post of 
presidential advisor, wrote: ``I have not seen the president in 
the past six months.'' I think the president is right: the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
prepares information and analyses on all environmental issues, 
so there is no need for any intermediaries. 
  P.S. As this article was being prepared NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
(No 13 (689), 21 January 1994) published another letter taking 
exception to my interview. It had the same hallmarks as the 
other, i.e. an extremely sloppy handling of facts, 
rumor-mongering and disregard for the law permeating virtually 
every line, and these things naturally lead one to conclude that 
all these opinions stem from a single source.

<F P=106> [Article: ``No One Wants To Be Guilty of an Ecological </F>
Catastrophe''] 
  [Text] Academicians Sergey Zalygin, Dmitriy 
Likhachev, and Aleksandr Yanshin published in our newspaper an 
extremely sharp article, entitled ``Environment of Extinction'' 
([No.] 200, 20 October 1993]. The authors considered it to be 
their task to point out the primary causes of the ecological 
blind alley -- the actions of the economic ministries during the 
years of the ``great construction projects'' that destroyed the 
environment (primarily, the activities of Minvodkhoz [Ministry 
of Water Management] when the project for diverting the northern 
and Siberian rivers was being created). They also see their task 
in revealing the facts in the history that has led us down the 
ecological blind alley. 
  Many readers are in total agreement with the authors of the 
article and write to us that ``Minvodkhoz, together with certain 
scientists, inflicted colossal damage on our country. That 
damage consists of the completely wasted tens of billions of 
rubles from the state budget at that time; the ruination of 
agriculture in many regions where millions of hectares of land 
that had been `improved' by water reclamation were written off; 
and the party leaders' crimes that they committed hand in hand 
with the people in water management.'' They also write, ``The 
water management partocracy is an as yet unrevealed and gloomy 
page in our economic and political history, and the role of the 
scientists in this secret system is a unique phenomenon that, 
sooner or later, will be deciphered.'' 
  At the same time, Candidate of Technical Sciences V. 
Aleksenko takes a negative attitude toward the academicians' 
pessimistic position. She feels that ``the resolution of the 
problem of the ecological crisis must be a party program of the 
social-democratic movement at the present-day stage. The way out 
of the ecological crisis has a concrete and accessible 
solution.'' But she ends her letter by saying, ``Despite all the 
offensive words said by me with respect to the authors of the 
article `Environment of Extinction,' their criticism of the 
state ecological service, and their brave opposition to the 
official structures, evoke a tremendous amount of respect and 
contribute to the awareness of social and ecological tasks.'' 
  However, in their article the academicians do not simply 
``oppose the official structures.'' In their article they give 
the names of specific people with whom, over the course of many 
years, they discussed the river diversion project. And that, 
naturally, evokes the sharp objections of those who were 
mentioned. In particular, the employees of Ministry of Ecology. 
  It is necessary to speak separately about a letter to the 
editor that was writtebjects n by F. V. Voropayev, corresponding 
member of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], who since 1977 has 
headed the Scientific Council for Problems of the Caspian Sea. 
He considers the article to be direct libel against himself, his 
council, and the AN [Academy of Sciences] Institute of Water 
Problems, where he was the director until recently. He demands 
the publication of his reply. We are printing it in abridged 
form. 
  ``The statement concerning the 'assimilation' of millions of 
rubles by the council is an insinuation that is intended for the 
uninformed readers. The council is a public organization that is 
not financed by the state. The council has not sold and does not 
sell information on the Caspian to Iran. The Russian Federation 
has a treaty of scientific-technical cooperation with the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, in accordance with which certain joint 
work is carried out. At such time each contracting side makes 
its own expenditures. No one has ever transferred funds, or 
transfers them now. This is firmly established in the 
cooperation documents... Other ridiculous assertions are 
those stating that the scientists at the Institute of Water 
Problems were the initiators, originators, and developers of the 
projects to divert part of the river runoff (emphasis 
added). In particular, this is attested to by the decisions of 
USSR Gosplan's State Expert Commission for reviewing the TEO 
[technical and economic substantiation] of the diversion of part 
of the runoff of the northern rivers to the drainage area of the 
Volga River. I was the deputy chairman of the commission to 
review the TEO, and a number of scientists from the Institute of 
Water Problems were members. According to our recommendations, 
the TEO was declined in 1980... As a result of what has been 
stated, I demand an immediate refutation of the article and the 
accusations from the newspaper's editorial office and the 
authors for having insulted the honor and dignity of a scientist 
and citizen. Otherwise I shall be forced to take court action.'' 
  The editorial office has acquainted the authors of the 
article ``Environment of Extinction'' with the objections made 
by Corresponding Member G. V. Voropayev. In response to his 
request they provide the following answer. In particular, 
concerning the council's monetary operations: 
  ``We must admit the insufficient precision of the 
formulations addressed to the Council on Problems of the Caspian 
Sea,'' the academicians write. ``The fact of the matter is that 
the Scientific Council on Problems of the Caspian Sea was 
created in the Institute of Water Problems, of the Academy of 
Sciences; it was financed by that institute; it consisted 
chiefly of its employees; and was headed by the director of that 
institute, V. Voropayev. It is therefore difficult to separate 
the activities of the council from the activities of the 
institute. It is possible that certain shortcomings addressed to 
G. V. Voropayev as the council chairman should pertain to his 
activities as the director of the institute.'' 
  The authors go on to mention the history of the river 
diversion and, in this regard, they are completely incapable of 
agreeing with G. V. Voropayev's version. They prove, by 
quotations taken from a number of works over a period of many 
years, that it was precisely he who was the initiator of the 
diversion project, but that he was covered by the efforts of 
other individuals. 
  In 1976 G. V. Voropayev wrote to VODNYYE RESURSY magazine 
(No. 3, pp 4-6): ``It is proposed to carry out the water supply 
of the southern rayons at the expense of the more complete use 
of local resources and the bringing in of the runoff of the 
country's northern slope (drainage areas of the Kara, White, and 
Barents seas), that is, at the expense of territorial 
redistribution on a large scale.'' He emphasized that ``the 
unity of water management ties on a countrywide scale is 
becoming especially obvious in the version of runoff 
redistribution that was developed by the USSR Academy of 
Sciences Institute of Water Problems.'' 
  We have been sent a Xerox copy of the book by G. V. 
Voropayev 
and A. A. Bostandzhoglo, ``Problema izyatiya, perebroski i 
raspredeleniya chasti stoka sibirskikh rek dlya rayonov Zapadnoy 
Sibiri, Urala, Sredney Azii i Kazakhstana'' [Problem of 
Withdrawing, Diverting, and Distributing Part of the Runoff of 
Siberian Rivers For Rayons of West Siberia, the Urals, Central 
Asia, and Kazakhstan]. The publisher is USSR Academy of Sciences 
Institute of Water Problems, 1984 (For Official Use Only). In 
these ``closed'' works we read on page 40, ``The development of 
the national economy determines the desirability of constructing 
a system among drainage areas for diverting the runoff of the 
Danube River into the Dniepr drainage area; the carrying out of 
a series of operations to divert part of the runoff of the 
northern rivers into the Volga drainage area; and the 
construction of the Volga-Urals and Volga-Don canals to use the 
diverted runoff in the Northern Caucasus for irrigation. 
Scientific research and feasibility studies that have been 
conducted have substantiated the desirability of diverting part 
of the runoff of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia and 
Kazakhstan in the volume of the first phase (27.2 cubic 
kilometers).'' The chapter entitled ``Conclusion'' states even 
more decisively: ``Computations have demonstrated the economic 
effectiveness of the measures being considered for diverting 
part of the runoff of Siberian rivers and the profitability of 
the complex within the normative limits.'' The authorship of the 
diversion project also does not cause any doubts. The statement 
is made that ``the approval of the TEO of the Asian diversion 
and the scientific research on the problem has become a stage 
that has summed up the results of many years of 
scientific-research and surveying-design work that was carried 
out by the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Water Problems 
and Soyuzgiprovodkhoz [All-Union State Planning, Surveying and 
Scientific Research Institute of Water Management 
Construction].'' 
  In their letter to the editor, the authors of the article 
``Environment of Extinction'' recall that, ``On 18 July 1986, at 
a session of the presidium of USSR Sovmin [Council of 
Ministers], success was achieved in stopping the insane work to 
divert the runoff. N. F. Vasilyev, minister of water management, 
considered the diversion of the runoff to be the only measure 
for saving the Caspian and the Aral Sea and a chief measure for 
developing agriculture, and he demanded the immediate expansion 
of earth-moving operations also on the Ob River and the area 
between the Volga and the Sukhona rivers. G. V. Voropayev 
defended the project even more fiercely than the minister did. 
Stenographic reports still exist, and there are many witnesses 
to this who are still alive. But G. V. Voropayev still did not 
calm down. Soon his article `The Project Will Live' appeared in 
newspapers, and in 1988, in an article in VODNYYE RESURSY (No. 
1, pp 5-13) that was written jointly with D. Ya. Radkevich, he 
asserted the very same position.'' 
  Meanwhile G. V. Voropayev considers specifically his 
constancy to be ethical. ``I do not change,'' he writes, ``my 
opinions to fit the political situation. I continue to work as a 
scientist on the same problems that I did ten years, and 40 
years, ago.'' In addition, he assumes that ``Environment of 
Extinction'' was conceived as a personal attack: ``The article 
was timed for a period when the nomination of candidates for 
election as members of the Academy of Science was coming to an 
end. Similar statements by the same authors did their `job' in 
the past, as was noted during the discussion of these questions 
at the Russian Academy of Sciences. That statement also 'started 
things working' today. At a number of official agencies that 
statement served as guidance during the making of decisions 
pertaining to the activities of our collective. The authors hope 
that it will continue to 'do its job.' S. P. Zalygin and A. L. 
Yanshin for many years asserted their impunity with regard to 
their libelous statements. The high positions occupied by both 
of them protected them against criticism and responsibility. But 
those protections are collapsing, and now it is becoming more 
obvious who is who.'' 
  Nevertheless, in our view, it is currently important not to 
delve into the problem of ``who is who,'' but to recall that, in 
the history of the river diversion, the final dot has been 
placed by the nation's powerful movement that has banned the 
disfigurement of the land. People have wanted, and want now, to 
have an environment in which they live, rather than become 
extinct. Therein lies the crux of the problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Zaldygin, Dmitriy Likhachev and Aleksandr </F>
Yanshin, academicians of the Russian Academy of Science: 
``Environment of Extinction''] 
  [Text] Adam Smith once declared nature to be one of the 
three essential components of production (nature, labor and 
capital). All Marxism-Leninism did was make that thesis the 
basis of its economy and policy and introduce it into the 
day-to-day life of an actual society. 
  On the basis of this fundamental thesis nature became 
nothing 
more than a resource and a raw material that needed to be 
processed in order for it to have any purpose. It was necessary 
to improve it, reshape it and transform it as required by the 
projects that were to build communism (e.g. the ``Great 
Stalinist Plan for the Transformation of Nature''). 
  As if nature could create a being much wiser than nature 
itself! 
  But here in the late 20th century humanity is turning its 
attention to ecology. We are beginning to realize that we must 
not elevate human beings above nature and not remove them from 
it, but, insofar as is still possible, make them a part of 
nature, and we also realize that human beings' needs are 
infinite, while natural resources are finite. 
<H5>  The Ministry of Ecotourism </H5>
  The state structures of all countries now have ecological 
services --assessment agencies, departments and committees. 
Predictably, here in Russia we have the biggest of them all: a 
ministry. In terms of its staff size that ministry is also at 
the top, with 630 people, almost twice as many as previously 
worked for a USSR ministry serving all 15 republics. 
  The parliament has officially adopted a ``Law on 
Environmental Protection.'' But can that be considered 
satisfactory, when the 1993 federal budget (though it has not 
yet received final approval) does not even contain a separate 
heading for environmental protection? 
  What about the fact that this law still is unaccompanied by 
various sublegal acts like a definition of environmental 
disaster areas and a statute on state environmental assessment, 
on monitoring of and compensation for damages to the natural 
environment, on economic indicators governing environmental 
protection activity, and on incentive measures? Environmental 
protection officials at the local level claim they are more 
likely to spend time overcoming bureaucratic obstacles in the 
ministry's 22 departments than they are to receive assistance 
and support from them. 
  In the United States 85 percent of all projects with an 
impact on the natural environment end up in court. That is 
understandable: even if a person cuts down his own forest he can 
cause damage to air quality far beyond the boundaries of his own 
property. Our Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources has not filed a single serious case against those 
responsible for many truly state-originated disasters. It seems 
that the ministry's favorite hobby is ``international 
relations'' -- i.e. innumerable symposiums, roundtable 
discussions and ``joint projects.'' What about the regions? They 
are completely uninteresting -- they have no round tables and no 
luncheon meetings! 
  One example of this sort of ``ecotourism'' was the World 
Environmental Conference held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Russia 
sent a group of 150 people to Rio, including a group of 
ministerial employees and the minister himself. What were the 
results? Where are they to be found? In what materials? There 
was apparently no room for those materials in our tourists' 
suitcases, nor could they stand the test of meetings, attending 
them on something of a rotating basis. 
  A few words about our public environmental movement. It is 
fading away. Once the movement was in a position to become a 
source of support for activities by the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and the government. But it did not -- a 
missed opportunity. There have been many missed opportunities. 
Just recall the idea of establishing an Ecological Fund. The 
time is past when the public could force the government to 
withdraw its plan to divert Siberian rivers' flow into the 
Caspian Sea, when the people of Volgograd were able to stop the 
construction of a second Volga-Don Canal, and when Leningraders, 
though not always successfully, at least energetically protested 
the construction of a dike across Neva Bay. 
  Another woe: public and scientific ecology are degenerating 
into semi-legal private companies. One example: the Ecology and 
Peace Association has among its members a company called the 
Center for Urban Ecological Studies, which could be called ``N. 
P. Yurina and Co.'' It makes dubious deals with Europe's 
``Ecological Building Blocks Initiative.'' 
<H5>  Ecology: The Science of Stabilization </H5>
  Up until now science has worked for progress, and only 
ecology makes stabilization its goal. 
  Science is undergoing a difficult time, a dramatically 
difficult time. Under the conditions that exist today scientists 
are out of the loop on environmental issues -- doing nothing and 
achieving nothing. During this ``time out of balance'' others 
are making their careers and reestablishing the positions they 
lost during the period when projects like the diversion of 
Siberian Rivers into the Caspian Sea, diversion of the Ob River 
into the Aral Sea, of the Volga into the Ural and Stavropol 
regions, the second Volga-Don Canal and many, many more were 
under development. One should not think that all these thoughts 
of ``diversion'' and huge projects have disappeared from the 
minds of those who came up with them and implemented them. Those 
same minds intend to maintain the state's monopoly over major 
construction, and if that is the case then both canals and water 
diversion projects will be back in the state's budget. 
  Even now we have before us the findings of certain experts 
claiming that the second Volga-Don Canal is essential, as it 
will divert a portion of the Volga's flow into the Don River and 
thereby help lower the level of the Caspian Sea. 
  But the second Volga-Don Canal's annual capacity is three 
cubic kilometers. That would lower the level of the Caspian Sea 
by only three millimeters, while the sea's level is rising by 10 
centimeters or more each year. Who stands to benefit from the 
canal: the Caspian Sea or the canal builders? At stake are 
trillions of rubles, so would it not be more reasonable to 
invest that money directly in agriculture instead of in the 
construction of irrigation canals? 
  The primary goal of the ``diversionists'' is to revive the 
great construction projects. Well-known engineer P. Polad-zade, 
former head of the former Ministry of Water Resources, is 
currently selling shares in the remains of that monster, the 
Vodstroy Concern -- the ministry's offspring, but an odd one, 
with authorized capital of R32.4 million. That is the price of 
one or two pieces of earthmoving equipment, even though the 
concern owns hundreds if not thousands of pieces of such 
equipment. This is who desperately needs a second Volga-Don 
Canal! 
  G. Voropayev, a corresponding member of the Academy of 
Sciences and one of the most active proponents of the idea of 
adding water to the Caspian Sea using northern rivers, is 
currently head of a council whose task is... to combat the 
flooding of coastal areas along the Caspian Sea, the level of 
which even without river diversion is already rising year after 
year. Yet many scientists had predicted that rise in sea level 
and warned Voropayev about it. 
  Voropayev's council -- comprised of more than 30 people -- 
is 
successfully snaring millions of Russian rubles and selling 
information on the Caspian Sea to Iran for a pittance, with no 
other fruits of its efforts to be seen. Nor has the position of 
the ``diversionists'' on solving the problem changed: as before 
the focus is on water management, not on broader socioeconomic 
principles. 
  The Russian Academy of Sciences Presidium twice sustained a 
motion of no confidence in Voropayev's nomination when he was 
appointed head of the current Caspian Council, yet the bureau of 
the Division of Oceanology, Atmospheric Physics and Geography 
(Academician V. Zuyev) stuck by its guns: the man who saved the 
Caspian Sea from ``drying up'' a few years ago would now save 
the land that the same sea is inundating! 
  An equally strange situation is emerging in connection with 
the plan for a hydroelectric power station on the Katun River. A 
dubious project. Over a period of many years the project was 
never proven to be justified, but now there is only one 
consideration: Gornyy Altay has become a component of the 
Federation. That is all that is needed to proclaim: on with the 
construction! There is no money, the region's geology and 
geochemistry are cause for concern, the republic's economy does 
not justify the project, but still we are going ahead with it! 
Next door in Barnaul is the Institute of Ecological and Aquatic 
Problems (corresponding member O. Vasilyev). That is who should 
have the final word, but the institute's scientists are hedging: 
they are afraid to say ``no,'' but it is also dangerous to say 
``yes.'' So many people are happy saying both ``no'' and 
``yes'': some money is being allocated toward this unresolved 
issue, but only a little. 
<H5>  Pressure From the Nuclear Industry </H5>
  On 24 December of last year the government decided to build 
a 
number of new nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation. 
The decision was made unexpectedly, without the prior knowledge 
of the scientific community. Ministry of Atomic Energy officials 
were well aware, as were their predecessors in the USSR Ministry 
of Medium Machine Building, that any open discussion of projects 
would elicit many justified objections. 
  The Ministry of Atomic Energy needs these plants, that is 
clear. But does the country need them, a country whose industry 
is declining with each passing year and consuming less and less 
energy? 
  The majority of our nuclear power plants have reactors of 
the 
same type that are at Chernobyl, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency considers them dangerous. IZVESTIYA has repeatedly 
reported on the dangerously dilapidated condition of the 
Leningrad Atomic Electric Power Station. 
  Those in the nuclear industry say that we must not lag 
behind 
France, which gets more than half of its energy from nuclear 
power. Yet they forget to mention that in France all nuclear 
power plants are located at a distance of at least 15 kilometers 
from population centers and are equipped with less dangerous 
reactors. They also forget to add that France has a powerful 
nuclear waste processing industry, while we store such waste on 
the surface (on the Kola Peninsula) or only lightly covered with 
earth, as at Sergiyev Posad near Moscow. Plus we have 
radioactive wastes both of our own origin and from abroad -- 
from nuclear power plants that we have built in other countries. 
Such were the terms of the contracts under which they were built. 
  Radiation from underground nuclear weapons testing at sites 
near Semipalatinsk, and to a lesser degree on Novaya Zemlya, 
covers extensive areas of the former Altay Kray, Novosibirsk 
Oblast, the northern Komi Republic, the Arctic Urals and the 
West Siberian coastline. Do not let them tell you that the 
radiation is slight, harmless and not in excess of permissible 
standards. Those ``standards'' are very provisional and have 
repeatedly been revised. And Chernobyl showed us that the 
residents of similar ``favorable'' areas in terms of their 
degree of radioactivity have become very ill and died agonizing 
deaths from cancer of the thyroid gland, liver and blood. 
  Yet Russia possesses tremendous reserves of natural gas, 
primarily in Tyumen Oblast. The portion of those reserves that 
has been explored and is ready for use totals tens of billions 
of cubic meters, with projected reserves of tens of trillions of 
cubic meters. That does not include fields that are beginning to 
be discovered on the floor of the Barents and Karsk seas, as 
well as along both coasts of Sakhalin. 
  We produce approximately one billion cubic meters of natural 
gas annually, and that is the one industrial sector where there 
has been no drop in production. That means we have enough 
natural gas to last for at least 300 years. By that time 
dangerous nuclear fission energy will have given way to safe 
nuclear fusion energy. According to assurances from American 
physicists, that will occur in the first decade of the 21st 
century. 
  Why are we about to build many dangerous nuclear power 
plants 
that will soon be outdated yet conserve our natural gas, the 
burning of which would produce energy that is environmentally 
clean and much cheaper? Or are we saving that natural gas so we 
can sell it at a low price to our foreign partners and buy from 
them at high prices capron, nylon and porolon clothing made from 
that same natural gas? That might be to someone's benefit, but 
it does not benefit the state. 
  Sweden does not have any coal, oil or natural gas fields. 
Nevertheless, after Chernobyl the Swedish Riksdag decided not to 
build a single new nuclear power plant and to shift all the 
country's further power development to heat and electric power 
generating stations using imported natural gas from seafloor 
deposits. 
<H5>  The Nature Giveaway </H5>
  In 1917 Russia, or a substantial portion thereof, came to 
believe that its greatest wealth in the world -- factories, 
plants, railroads, lands with their forests and mineral wealth, 
and rivers -- should be forcibly expropriated from their private 
owners, including the Romanov dynasty, and become truly the 
people's property. That was precisely how Soviet slogans and 
decrees framed the issue. And what happened? What happened was 
that all that wealth wound up in the hands of the party elite, 
which not only had complete control of the country's entire 
natural environment, but also arbitrarily experimented with 
nature, plundered it and crippled it with gigantic construction 
projects. 
  In our country privatization is like a giveaway. It would 
seem that a giveaway is not acquisition, so the matter should be 
much simpler. In fact, it is much more complex than a direct 
requisition of the socialist type. Why is that so? Because both 
those who are doing the giving (the state apparatus, the state 
bureaucracy) and those who are receiving (the ``new 
capitalists'') have virtually the same opportunities for 
personal enrichment. Neither group wants to miss those 
opportunities. Neither group currently has the slightest 
interest in ecology or any concern over how to preserve forests, 
soils, mineral resources, rivers and a clean atmosphere. All 
current programs in this regard are not worth the paper they are 
printed on, if only because they are in no way connected with 
the theoretical principles, much less the practical application, 
of privatization. That practical application, in turn, should be 
based on new principles of ownership, from which it would be 
clear who would have the right to possess what, in what amount 
and on what terms. Until we establish those principles of 
ownership there can be no civilized privatization, nor any point 
in discussing ecology -- it will just be pushed aside. 
  An oblast boss calls a rayon boss: 
  ``Petr Ivanovich! Sell this guy a piece of land! With a 
little garden plot! Do it!'' 
  That is all that has to be said. The ``guy'' is not just 
anybody, he is a restaurant owner! 
  And so Russia's forests, minerals resources and water are 
being exploited (and plundered and polluted) at an 
unprecedentedly frenzied rate. 
  It is impossible to say where privatization will lead under 
the current system (i.e. disorder and chaos). Politics without 
well-founded projection is nothing more than adventurism. And so 
the richest country in the world is going around the world with 
its hand outstretched. 
<H5>  Not Under Public Scrutiny </H5>
  The problem is also with our level of ecological awareness. 
Each of us could make various suggestions to the government. For 
example, we feel that state authority today requires three 
police forces: civil police, tax police and 
sanitary-environmental police. But that is just one small 
detail. The awareness of every citizen of the Federation is 
another matter. It is clear that police forces, even a dozen of 
them, cannot fix this situation if citizens today are 
indifferent to the task of preserving their greatest wealth -- 
nature -- and if each of us does not feel ourselves in at least 
some way the owner of that wealth and thus obligated to pass it 
on to our children and grandchildren. 
  There is still time to think and realize. Not much, just a 
short time, but there is still time. 
  The reader has probably noticed that articles on 
environmental issues have become a rarity in our newspapers. Not 
one of our large-circulation publications has launched even a 
weekly or monthly environmental column. We can say with 
certainty that if our scientific community and our culture 
ignore the problems of ecology the cause is doomed to failure.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Penyagin, chairman of </F>
the All-Russian State and Public Radioekologiya Fund, by an 
unidentified correspondent; from the ``Utro'' program; date and 
place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Chernobyl is our constant agony. Recently 
mysterious things have been occurring in the disaster zone. 
Specialists have to their own great surprise discovered the 
radioactive element Americium-241, a substance dangerous to all 
living things. This element should not have escaped the 
sarcophagus. Nevertheless, this has happened. Americium-241 is 
very dangerous since even in miniscule amounts it causes the 
severest poisoning and mutations. Scientists are presently 
wracking their brains on how to prevent the spread of this 
element beyond the disaster zone. 
  Of course, there are many other very serious problems in 
Chernobyl, and apparently the Ukraine will not be able to solve 
them alone. That is why Ukrainian ecologists may be interested 
in the work of the All-Russian State and Public Radioekologiya 
Fund. Our Novosibirsk correspondent talks with Aleksandr 
Penyagin, chairman of this fund. [video shows 
correspondent talking with Penyagin who has a large map of 
Central Siberia on the desk at which he sits] 
  Correspondent: Could you tell us what brought you 
to Novosibirsk? 
  Penyagin: Well, you may recall the logic of 
events. First Chernobyl, then the Urals -- I mean the problem 
which we raised and elevated to the level of a state program 
there. The third state program concerns the consequences of the 
effects of the Semipalatinsk test range. 
  Correspondent: You mean the rehabilitation of the 
population, yes? 
  Penyagin: Both of the population and the 
territory, absolutely. The Semipalatinsk test range aftermath 
affected the Altay, the mountainous Altay, and part of 
Novosibirsk Oblast. That is the first point, and we consider 
that it is necessary to begin solving radiation and ecological 
issues throughout Siberia. Not many people are aware of it, but 
the Yenisey -- that wonderful, beautiful, and mighty river -- 
has been polluted over almost 1,000 km. This problem will have 
to be solved at the appropriate state level. The same problem 
exists on the Tom River, and so forth. This involves underground 
nuclear tests carried out for national economic purposes, and so 
forth. 
  Correspondent: What do you mean by a state 
program? Are there simply tasks or are their funds as well? 
  Penyagin: It is both tasks and funds. Everything 
has already been scheduled, what everyone has to do. The prime 
minister has already signed this and the organizations which are 
implementing this state program have already been informed. In 
other words, real assistance to the region is beginning. 
  Correspondent: Aleksandr Nikolayevich, I do not 
want to make you into a kind of hero, as has been traditional in 
our propaganda presentations, heaven forbid, but tell us, to 
compile this kind of a map for yourself, a map showing the 
unfortunate areas, a map of your activities, you must have 
visited all these places, that is how I imagine it, yes? These 
are all places which people would leave if they had the 
opportunity, which they would probably flee. Yet you went 
there. Tell us, how did you feel and how do you feel today 
after all this? 
  Penyagin: First of all, I have had excellent 
experiences. I did all my service on a nuclear submarine. So 
radiation is something I am familiar with. On the other hand, 
if a person decides to solve a problem which he is sounding out 
for others as a state problem, then his personal choices must 
take second place. If you have never been in these regions, if 
you cannot recognize the situation with your eyes closed ... 
[Penyagin pauses] Well, for a government official, a 
bureaucratic attitude to people and the territory as a rule 
turns into mistakes. 
  These mistakes have a very harmful effect on the budget and 
on some categories of people who have been overlooked because a 
bureaucratic outlook does not permit a comprehensive assessment 
of the situation. So in this case, strange as it may seem, one 
must visit these places, one must see how state programs are 
being implemented, one must know how to set up a system to 
verify state activities, and even to verify the activities of 
the legislators themselves. 
  Correspondent: Aleksandr Nikolayevich, you 
presently head a fund known as, which has the status of a state 
public fund, the Radioekologiya Fund. What is this fund? What 
do you have at your disposal and what are you doing with the 
funds which you now have or will have? 
  Penyagin: First of all, our fund has narrowed 
things down to four areas -- social, economic, ecological, and 
moral rehabilitation of those areas which have suffered from the 
effects of radiation. To implement the program of ecological 
rehabilitation of radioactively contaminated lands, we have 
established an entire specialized company which we call the 
Bioflora Joint Stock Association. It has the high technologies 
which are capable of cleaning lands with low radioactive 
contamination. 
  Correspondent: Have you already begun working on 
this? 
  Penyagin: Yes of course, we are working, and I 
hope that the time will come when I can show you the results of 
what we are doing.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Lvov report: ``Nuclear Waste Will Be Destroyed by </F>
Explosions''] 
  [Text] This news is not for those of a nervous 
disposition: It is possible that in the foreseeable future all 
Russia's radioactive waste and chemical weapons will be 
destroyed...by nuclear explosion. By several explosions, to be 
precise, which will be detonated deep within the permafrost of 
Russia's only nuclear test site on the island of Novaya Zemlya. 
  This program has been expounded by Major General Vladimir 
Loborev, academician and chief of the Ministry of Defense 
Central Physics and Technical Institute, and Aleksandr 
Chernyshev, deputy director of the Federal Nuclear Center 
(Arzamas-16), in reports to a closed scientific seminar held at 
the ``Uran'' Science and Production Association, which your 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent managed to attend. 
Representatives from our most important organizations in this 
field attended the seminar: the Ministry of Defense, the 
Ministry of Atomic Power Engineering and Industry, the Federal 
Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the Ministry of 
Environment and Natural Resources, the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, and the Academy of Natural Sciences. 
  There are several ways of recycling radioactive waste. The 
idea of sending waste into space is the most utopian of these 
schemes, according to Vladimir Loborev. However, the most 
practical method is plunging the fatal waste into glass and 
burying it in ``deep geological formations.'' The largest 
vitrification plant is located in France. It cost $500 million 
to build. 
  According to Loborev, to destroy all of Russia's waste would 
require 20 such plants, each of which would have to operate 
continuously for 10 years. The Russian economy would be unable 
to bear costs of this magnitude. But the problem is becoming 
increasingly acute -- obsolete ships with nuclear reactors that 
can neither be used nor scuttled are piling up at the piers of 
Severodvinsk and other ports.... 
  A nuclear explosion would be far less costly. And the 
authors of the plan claim that after the explosion the waste 
would be buried in accordance with all the regulations -- the 
extremely high temperature would turn the rock and the 
radioactive waste housed in underground passageways into an 
large vitreous mass which would be covered by a thick layer of 
compacted soil and rubble. Thus embedded, the waste would never 
be able to ``surface''; besides, all around there is permafrost 
which, according to the specialists, would present no threat for 
many centuries, even if a subtropical climate were to occur on 
Novaya Zemlya. 
  The chemical weapons situation is somewhat more complex. In 
Russia it is kept in seven large storage facilities, some of 
which are located near major cities. They must be destroyed as 
soon as possible in accordance with international conventions 
and following the dictates of common sense, but the technology 
to do this does not exist at the present time. Scientists 
believe that in this case the ``nuclear explosion'' method looks 
more promising, although it would require some extremely complex 
chemical calculations. 
  The authors of the plan assure us that the program is at the 
scientific development stage and will under no circumstances be 
implemented without thorough expert assessments, international 
monitoring, explanations to the population, and, of course, 
presidential and government approval. In order to obtain the 
last item on this list, the plan would have to do the rounds of 
a number of competent departments. The seminar decided that it 
would be submitted for examination by the recently established 
Scientific Council under the Russian Federation Security Council. 
  We can only hope that amid all the current confusion in 
Russia, these important ``formalities'' will not be forgotten. 
After all, we already possess experience of the unpredictable 
behavior of the peaceful atom in Russia.

  [Text] Petrozavodsk, Feb 11 TASS--Thirty three years ago 
the former Soviet Union dumped thousands of tonnes of chemical 
shells in northern seas and scientists fear the secret burial 
grounds may be the reason for a high mortality rate among the 
local population, according to a Russian daily which quoted a 
participant of the secret dumping operation. 
  Ero Pavilainen, a resident of the northern Russian city of 
Petrozavodsk, served in early 60's in a military unit near the 
town of Pechenga, close to the Norwegian border. He told the 
Petrozavodsk-based newspaper ``NORTHERN COURIER'' on Friday that 
he and other soldiers had unloaded numerous railway cars with 
bombs with mustard gas. 
  ``These were the Soviet chemical weapons accumulated since 
the (World) War (Two). They were delivered by trains from 
various military units of the Soviet Union and dumped in the 
Arctic Ocean,'' Pavilainen was quoted as saying. 
  The newspaper added that measurements taken by experts in 
certain parts of the White Sea showed that the water and soil 
there are contaminated and unsuitable for living organisms. 
  It added that the secret burial places of chemical weapons 
may be the reason for a high mortality rate, especially among 
newborns, registered in several settlement along the coast.

  [Text] Vladivostok, Feb 11 TASS -- A group of Japanese and 
South Korean experts in nuclear power arrived in Vladivostok. 
The group intends to inspect the recent dumping grounds of 
radioactive wastes of the Pacific Fleet and will study problems 
involved in the processing of radioactive wastes and their 
impact on the environment. 
  Members of the group will report their findings to the 
Foreign Ministries of their countries which arranged for their 
trip to the Primorye territory. 
  The group includes Amano Yukiya, chief of the Nuclear Power 
Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This is not his

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Strugovets: ``Is the Ocean the First To </F>
Perish?''] 
  [Text] The first dumping of radioactive waste (RAO) 
in the seas was performed by the USA in 1946 in the northeast 
part of the Pacific Ocean, at a distance of 80 kilometers from 
the coast of California. Since that time, the World Ocean has 
become truly a storehouse of spent nuclear raw material... 
  Great Britain has dumped three-fourths of all the 
world's RAO into the ocean, performing 34 burials of solid 
radioactive fuel in 15 sites in the North Atlantic, The Minch, 
the Bay of Biscay and in the region of the Canary Islands in the 
period from 1949 through 1982. The mass of dumped containers 
comprises 74,052 tonnes, with an overall activity of 949 kCi 
[kilocurie]. 
  The disposal of liquid RAO from atomic industry enterprises 
by means of dumping through pipelines into the Irish Sea was 
also widely practiced in England. And this too was a 
considerable amount. From 1974 through 1982 the waste products 
dumped annually exceeded an overall activity of 100 kCi. The 
total scope of the dumping was so great that its effects were 
seen as far as the Barents and Karsk Seas. 
  The Netherlands, in the period from 1967 through 
1982, had 14 cases of RAO dumping at four sites in the North 
Atlantic at a depth of 3,200 - 5,200 meters, with a mass of 
19,162 tonnes and overall activity of 9.1 kCi. 
  France has had two cases of dumping RAO into the 
Atlantic Ocean. The mass of dumped waste comprised 14,299 
tonnes, with activity of 9.54 kCi. In 1979, waste from nuclear 
enterprises was dumped into The Minch. 
  Switzerland has dumped RAO 12 times in the period 
from 1969 through 1982 at three sites in the North Atlantic. The 
mass of the materials dumped comprised 5,321 tonnes, and their 
overall activity was 119 kCi. 
  The USA, in the period from 1949 through 1967, has 
dumped 34,282 containers of RAO with overall activity of 79.4 
kCi at 11 sites in the Atlantic. In the period from 1946 through 
1970 it dumped 560,261 containers with overall activity of 15 
kCi at 18 sites in the Pacific Ocean. 
  Moreover, during the period of operation of the nuclear 
fleet, the U.S. naval forces have lost two nuclear 
submarines--the ``Thresher'' (April of 1969) and the 
``Scorpion'' (May of 1968). Together with the first nuclear 
submarine alone, there turned out to be around 270 kCi in 
fission products at the bottom of the ocean. Plus the loss of a 
number of nuclear weapons. 
  Japan performed dumping of RAO into the Pacific 
Ocean near its shores in 1956-1969. It performed 12 disposal 
operations at six sites, dumping 3,301 containers with overall 
activity of 0.416 kCi. 
  Belgium has dumped RAO 15 times, in The Minch and 
the Bay of Biscay, disposing of 55,324 containers with overall 
activity of 57.24 kCi. 
  This list is rounded out by Germany, Korea, Italy, New 
Zeleand and Sweden, through whose efforts the overall activity 
of RAO dumped into the World Ocean has been brought up to 1,240 
kCi. This, we will emphasize, is without taking into 
consideration the waste from plants processing nuclear fuel, 
lost nuclear weapons and other sources of ionizing radiation, 
sunken nuclear submarines and radionuclides which have found 
their way into the ocean as a result of underwater nuclear 
explosions. However, a number of specialists maintain that the 
real number is somewhat higher. Yet the main mass of radioactive 
waste--over 98 percent--is buried in the Atlantic Ocean. 
  We will note that in recent years, as a result of the sharp 
criticism of this practice, all the states have reduced or 
discontinued altogether their dumping of RAO into the seas. Yet 
in spite of this, they have reserved the right to dump 
radioactive waste in the World Ocean. In Great Britain and 
France the possibility of step-by-step dumping of RAO into the 
sea has been officially granted--by the Convention on Protection 
of the Marine Environment in the Northeast Atlantic--until the 
year 2018. 
  And what about Russia? Or more precisely, the USSR, since it 
is specifically from it that we have inherited the problems of 
dumping radioactive waste in the seas. 
  And so, the first dumping of RAO in the USSR was performed 
in 
1959 and was associated with the testing of nuclear submarines 
and the nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin.'' In September of that 
year, 600 cubic meters of waste with overall activity of 20 mKci 
were dumped into the White Sea. In 1960, 100 cubic meters of 
liquid RAO with overall activity of 200 mCi were dumped from the 
nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin'' near Gotland Island (Gulf of 
Finland). That year marked the beginning of the practice of 
regular dumping of liquid radioactive waste, and 1964 marked the 
start of dumping of solid RAO into the northern and far eastern 
seas. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-006-49A>           Graphic </FIG>




  Let us begin with the North. According to the report by the 
governmental commission on questions concerning the dumping of 
radioactive waste at sea, in the northern region of the USSR, 
and now in Russia, there are four regions for dumping liquid 
radioactive waste and disposal of solid radioactive waste. These 
are located generally north of the 72nd parallel and west of 
Novaya Zemlya. These regions were selected by the staff 
headquarters of the Northern Fleet in 1960-1966 and approved by 
the Naval Fleet Main Staff Headquarters. Up until 1986, the 
Murmansk Steamship Line also performed such dumping of RAO in 
the regions designated for the Northern Fleet. 
  The dumping was extremely non-uniform, and the maximal 
values 
of activity were noted in 1965 (northeastern part of the Barents 
Sea, around 1,000 Ci), in 1975 (central part of the Barents 
Sea--800 Ci and Karsk Sea--8,500 Ci), in 1988 (northeastern part 
of Barents Sea, around 5,300 Ci), and in 1989 (as a result of 
the accident of the nuclear submarine at Ara-guba, 2,000 Ci). 
  In a breakdown by seas, the level of overall activity is 
distributed as follows: Baltic--0.2 Ci, White--100 Ci, 
Barents--12,153 Ci, Karsk--8,500 Ci. On the whole, it is 24 kCi. 
  Is this a lot? 
  For comparison we may cite the following fact: Studies 
performed by a scientific expedition in 1985-1986 showed that 
the underwater current of the Gulf Stream in that year alone 
from the North Atlantic--the site of constant dumping of RAO by 
Great Britain and France--has brought us radioactive waste with 
overall activity of around 24 kCi. As much as we dumped in the 
northern seas over a period of 30 (!) years. 
  The Far Eastern region. Since 1966, the USSR performed 
dumping of RAO in the Far Eastern seas in 10 regions. The 
greatest amount of radioactive waste (by volume) was dumped near 
the southeastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula. And the 
greatest amount by overall radioactivity was dumped into the Sea 
of Japan. The maximal amount of dumping in terms of 
radioactivity occurred in 1975 and 1985-1987. The overall 
radioactivity of the RAO comprised 18,565 Ci. 
  In the opinion of specialists, considering the huge water 
area in the Far Eastern region, the RAO dumped by the Pacific 
Fleet comprises no more than a few percent in the balance of 
anthropogenic radioactive pollution, and therefore cannot cause 
an ecological catastrophe. This is true in full measure also of 
the Fall (1993) dumping of RAO by the ships of the Pacific 
Fleet. ``The dumping in the Sea of Japan in October,'' 
emphasized the head of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Ecological Safety 
Main Administration, Viktor Kutsenko, in a speech presented at a 
recently held ``roundtable'' on problems of dumping RAO in the 
seas, ``posed no danger to the environment. And subsequent 
dumping, which will be practiced in this region until the end of 
next year, will also not pose a hazard. We may even not consider 
this waste as being radioactive.'' 
  Nevertheless, according to Kutsenko himself, an ecological 
threat really does hang over the Far East. But the reason for 
it, as it turns out, is not the radioactive waste which has been 
dumped into the sea, but that which is being stored in special 
tankers of the Pacific Fleet. This problem is confirmed also by 
specialists at the VMF Glavkomat [Naval High Command]. In the 
opinion of one of them, Captain 1st rank Yevgeniy Romanov, the 
TNT-5 and TNT-27 industrial tankers loaded with liquid 
radioactive waste are in such a poor technical state that they 
may sink at any time. Then the huge concentration--several 
hundred cubic meters--of radioactive waste would really cause a 
catastrophe. In order to avoid this, the decision was adopted to 
begin dumping in the water basin of the Sea of Japan. The 
dumping, I repeat, is caused by technical necessity. And even if 
under the pressure of the world community we will have to 
discontinue such actions in neutral waters, the specialists at 
the VMF Glavkomat will insist on at least one-time dumping 
within the limits of Russian territorial waters. 
  Of course, the dumping of radioactive waste in the World 
Ocean cannot continue for long. Yet today, practically in the 
entire world, the technology of processing radioactive waste 
lags behind the demands. Here in Russia, one other problem is 
added to this. Despite the fact that we possess sufficient 
scientific and technical potential to create the necessary 
conditions for processing liquid RAO into solid and for its 
subsequent disposal, we cannot take serious steps forward due to 
the shortage of finances. And a significant amount of these will 
be required. According to preliminary estimates, around 10 
billion rubles (R) would be needed to solve the problem of 
radioactive waste in the Pacific Fleet. In the Northern 
Fleet--approximately half that amount would be needed. For a 
full resolution of the problem in the country--several hundred 
billion rubles would be needed, and with application of Western 
technologies--several hundred million dollars. 
  However, it is erroneous to think that this problem is 
Russia's alone. The World Ocean is the cradle of life on the 
planet, and all countries which consider themselves civilized 
must apply their efforts to keep from destroying it.

  [Text] Some regions of Gomel Oblast -- the ones that have 
most seriously suffered from the Chernobyl accident and from 
which the majority of the local population have fled -- are 
currently being inhabited by refugees from hotspots in the CIS. 
Recently, for example, more than 100 applications for permanent 
residence have been filed in Dobrush Town militia passport 
department. People, including families with small children, 
from the Baltics, Transcaucasia, and Kazakhstan come here. It 
is better to die slowly from radiation than quickly from 
criminals, say the refugees. This is their main reason for 
changing their place of residence. Willing to demonstrate that 
they are not really scared by high levels of radiation, 12 
families have already settled in Dubovy Loh village where the 
radiation level is 15-40 curies per square kilometer. Local 
authorities are delighted because they have acquired an 
additional labor force. However, what about the refugees' 
children?

<F P=106> [Interview with Baris Parfenavich Savitski, head of the </F>
Supreme Soviet commission for ecology and rational use of 
natural resources, by Natalya Babina; place and date not given: 
``Paradise Is German Economy Accompanied by Our Ecological 
Legislation'' -- first four paragraphs is ZVYAZDA introduction] 
  [Text] It is a paradox: The more unsafe is our ecological 
situation, the greater number of people become ill from various 
diseases, and the less people think about protecting nature. Is 
this a reaction of an ostrich who -- at the sight of danger -- 
hides his head in the sand? It is very difficult to meet a 
person who understands that protection of the environment is a 
much more important task than economic reforms and political 
scandals. However, fortunately, there are such people among us. 
They are ecologists. They are professional amateurs, 
enthusiasts and skeptics, gloomy pessimists and decisive 
romantics.... If mankind survives, this will only occur through 
their efforts. 
  Our guest today is an ecologist, if it is possible to say 
so, 
he is No. 1 in Belarus. He is reserved, he hates loud phrases 
and effective gestures. Nevertheless, when my 
colleagues-deputies voted down one of the ecological issues, he 
said ``Shame on you!'' and left the session hall. 
  I recalled this event. He impatiently waved his hand. ``At 
my age, it was just okay.'' 
  However, I have my own opinion on this issue. Professor, 
author of more than 300 research publications, Baris Parfenavich 
Savitski heads a Supreme Soviet commission for ecology and the 
rational use of natural resources, and demonstrates the 
professionalism and wisdom of a competent politician. 
  Babina: Baris Parfenavich, you have been working 
in the legislature for more than three years. What are the 
results of your work? With what feelings do you view those 
three years? 
  Savitski: First of all, I have to say that the 
work in the commission takes all my time, and I am completely 
devoid of time for the fulfillment of my deputy duties. 
Therefore, my technical secretary fulfills that part of my 
work. I am concerned with this. However, I am satisfied with 
the results of the work of my commission. 
  We faced the task of creating a group of ecological laws 
that 
would consider the new status of the Republic, its sovereignty, 
and emerging market relations in Belarus. Our first draft law 
had to reorganize the entire structure of the system of 
environmental protection in the Republic, to establish a 
powerful centralized system of control, and to do away with 
numerous organizations that duplicate each other's activities. 
Many deputies thought that this draft law was too advanced and 
voted it down. However, some elements of this law are being 
implemented in other laws and legal norms. 
  We have begun to develop the so-called code of ecological 
laws. These laws include a number of ecological issues -- the 
protection of the environment in general, the protection of 
water, land, animals, and plants, etc., and the mechanism for 
their implementation. However, it is simply impossible to adopt 
all these laws at one Supreme Soviet session. Therefore, we 
proposed discussing the most important ``Law on Environmental 
Protection.'' 
  The Law ``On State Ecological Examination'' is currently 
included in the state planning system and implemented in the 
decisions on the socioeconomic development of Belarus. The 
implementation of various draft projects that did not receive a 
positive assessment of ecological experts will not be financed 
by the state. This is the most effective economic lever. 
  I feel proud that no other state has the same precise 
concept 
of ecological examination. In my opinion, experts from the 
World Bank for Reconstruction and Development and my 
colleagues-deputies from other states -- with whom we usually 
cooperate on these issues -- agree that this law is a great 
achievement for our legislature. 
  The Law ``On Industrial and Consumer Waste'' has been 
recently published in the press. Implementation of this law 
will considerably decrease the negative impact of waste on the 
environment and make entrepreneurs use this waste in industrial 
production. Economic measures will also help to implement this 
task. 
  Our Republic is literally flooded with proposals to build 
enterprises for storage and processing of radioactive or 
chemical waste. Considering that Western businessmen are ready 
to propose enormous bribes, some of our officials are ready to 
permit the construction of such production sites on our 
territories that are already contaminated with radionuclides. 
Well, the new law categorically bans transporting all kinds of 
waste to Belarus, excluding the waste which can be processed at 
the already existing Belarusian production sites, however, after 
a strict ecological examination. This law also limits 
transporting waste through our territory because it can cause 
terrible consequences. Do you remember how the waste with 
radionuclides poured out of containers at Brest railway station? 
  These three laws have been recently adopted by our 
legislature. I can say that if my name is put under only these 
three laws, I will claim that my life was worth living. 
  Hence, our commission is doing well. However, if all 14 
members of our commission were professional lawmakers, our 
results could have been more fruitful. The issue of a 
professional legislature arises, however, this is an issue for 
another interview. 
  Babina: You often go abroad. Can you compare our 
ecological legislation with that of foreign states? 
  Savitski: The financial situation of our state is 
in a miserable state, that is why I cannot go to the states I 
would like to visit, but to the states where I am invited.... 
Therefore, it is difficult to speak about all the states. I am 
sure that if not for Chernobyl, the ecological situation in 
Belarus would not have been worse, but even better than in some 
European states. Currently, we have a lot of difficult 
problems. In the first place, the change in the chemical 
composition of Belarusian soil as an aftermath of acid rains and 
air pollution due to the means of transportation. These are 
global issues. The local issue of key importance is the waste 
from Soligorsk and Gomel chemical factories; the negative 
results of foolish land improvement; and the ecological 
situation in Novopolotsk. 
  As for the legislation, it is not worse than in West 
European 
states and in some respects it is better. In the West, the 
implementation of ecological projects is often hampered by 
parliamentary agricultural and industrial lobbies. I am 
convinced that paradise is the German economy accompanied by our 
ecological legislation. To my regret, we are too far away from 
this paradise. However, in my opinion, under market conditions, 
the mechanism of control over the implementation of ecological 
laws is becoming more and more operative. Many of our 
industrial and agricultural sites are owned by persons who are 
responsible before the law. 
  Babina: You are heading the Belarusian Ecological 
Union. This is one of our numerous new public organizations. 
How do you assess the activity of ``the greens'' in the 
Republic? 
  Savitski: I have no single opinion on the issue. 
I do not like the appearance of the so-called ``banning'' trend 
in this organization. Often, despite real conditions, they 
demand that some sites not be constructed. However, life is 
life. Therefore, in my opinion, the key task of ecologists is 
not to ban but to choose the right option. To my regret, we are 
meeting more often with these ``banning'' demands. Sometimes, 
they are offended that we did not support their proposals. I 
can give you some examples: There is a project for the 
construction of an industrial site for production of sodium 
carbonate from the waste of the Soligorsk chemical factory. It 
may seem that everything is okay, because the Republic badly 
requires this substance. Moreover, it will be produced from 
this waste.... However, the Soligorsk Union of Ecologists has 
been writing letters of protest to all organizations and 
departments of the Republic, as well as to the UN ecological 
departments. In fact, Soligorsk ecologists are not against the 
construction of this kind of a factory, however, they oppose its 
construction on their territory. That is, waste from the 
Soligorsk chemical factory will have to be transported somewhere 
else.... If this union of ecologists made attempts to make this 
production safer -- there are no safe technologies overall -- 
their actions could have been more fruitful. 
  Babina: You receive many letters from ordinary 
people. What are they about? 
  Savitski: Each day, we receive about 30 letters. 
They are varied. Ecologists and workers of various branches of 
our economy send their proposals on various issues. We also 
receive many letters from working collectives. We try to answer 
all these letters. 
  Babina: ZVYAZDA wrote about the debates between 
Belarusian and Ukrainian ecologists on the issue of constructing 
a building materials factory close to Malorita. Has this issue 
been resolved? 
  Savitski: This issue has been discussed on all 
levels. A very representative commission of Belarusian 
ecologists has come to the conclusion that nothing threatens the 
Shatskiye Lakes. Nevertheless, we can listen to all the counter 
arguments of our Ukrainian colleagues. 
  I hope that they will also take into consideration our 
protests about the decision of the Ukrainian legislature to 
continue the operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. 
  Babina: The last question. What is awaiting 
Belarus in 10-15 years? 
  Savitski: I would hope for Belarus, especially its 
northern part, to become a kind of Switzerland within the CIS, a 
zone for tourism, recreation, and farming. Our industry should 
be equipped with modern technology. 
  In general, it seems to me that Belarus has all the chances 
for becoming a state respected by the international community. 
The Belarusian agricultural sector can provide us with our own 
food, our industry -- with raw materials. We should discard the 
practice of using pesticides and herbicides, and begin working 
for export. As for our industry, I can hear that many people 
say that we experience a lack of raw materials, and can become 
``an assembly shop'' for the CIS. In my opinion, in due time, 
this peculiarity of Belarus will make our Republic one of the 
most developed in the CIS. Please, pay attention, Japan is also 
``an assembly shop'' for the planet and neither Japan, nor Great 
Britain, nor Switzerland, nor Germany can boast of rich natural 
resources. This fact does not impede them from being rich.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Leaders of the Estonian 
Greens Movement in a statement Tuesday [8 February] said the 
Estonian- Dutch company Pak-Terminal has failed to abide by the 
established regulations while building a fuel terminal in 
Tallinn. 
  The Greens were referring to a government ruling from 13 
November 1992, which requires all fuel terminal projects to be 
subjected to expert examination as to their environment 
implications. A building permit can be issued only after the 
plan has successfully passed the expert commission. 
  Pak-Terminal started work on its 57,000 cubic meter terminal 
facility for oil products of the 3rd risk class without expert 
examination of the project. The building permit was issued 
illegally and the expert report drawn up later, the council of 
the Greens Movement says in its statement. 
  They also say the company has started work on a second 
facility, this time for 70,000 cubic meters of oil products of 
the 1st risk class. 
  Building was started without expertise as to ecologic 
aspects, the Greens say. 
  The national construction inspectorate on Feb. 3 ordered 
work 
on the second facility suspended. It was only on Feb. 7 that 
the project was handed to the municipality's Environment Board 
and the Ministry of Environment.

  [Text] Estonia should adopt laws which would entirely 
prohibit import of dangerous waste, both with the aim of 
recycling and reusage, international Greenpeace representative 
Asa Skillius told a press conference on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Skillius said that 103 states have already prohibited 
importing dangerous waste, among others Hungary, Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia. 
  Head of Estonian Green Movement Baltic Sea Bureau Valdur 
Lahtvee said that as Estonia has no such law, problems with 
dangerous waste being imported with uncertain aims have already 
risen, quoting an incident two years ago when Asian Trade Gmbh 
and its Estonian partner United Products imported great numbers 
of used tyres which for an unclear reason caught fire. He also 
said that at present a cooperation project with Finnish Kemira 
to produce water purification coagulate was under way, in the 
course of which dangerous titanium oxyde waste is to be imported.

  [Text] Environment Minister Andres Tarand met a delegation 
of the ``Greenpeace'' environment protection organisation 
yesterday. Heads of the ``Greenpeace'' hazardous waste group 
Kevin Stairs and the Baltic Sea group Rune Leithe-Eriksen 
attempted to convince the minister to adopt stricter measures 
against import of hazardous waste. 
  Estonia has joined the Basel convention on the transport of 
hazardous waste and its national requirements are even stricter 
than those of the convention. But Estonia has been opposing a 
total ban, which would prevent import of any materials. Tarand 
pointed out that the Tallinn Water Treatment Plant uses certain 
titanium waste which comes under the intended ``Greenpeace'' 
ban. The Estonian Green Movement intends to hold a news 
conference today to express its opinion.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 21, LETA -- The Estonian delegation from 
the Ministry of the Environment Protection last week paid a 
two-day visit to Latvia in order to work out the treaty on 
cooperation with the similar institution in Latvia and sign it. 
  According to the approved document, in future, the two 
ministries will jointly solve the problems of the improving of 
the waters in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga, coordinate 
economic activities in the pre-frontier land regions, take care 
of the maintenance of the sound environment in the places of 
migration of birds and in nature reserves. An agreement relating 
to the common positions in strengthening of the control over 
possible transit transportation of dangerous waste via Latvia 
and Estonia was also reached. The two states will regularly 
exchange business information with each other. 
  As soon as a corresponding ministry will be laid in the 
Republic of Lithuania, a trilateral treaty will be signed. Then, 
the joint programme of cooperation among the Baltic States in 
the sphere of the environment protection will be worked out.

<F P=106> [Report by Oles Buzyna: ``Henceforth, Ukraine and Poland Are </F>
Allies''] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian and Polish ministers of environmental 
protection signed an agreement in Warsaw on cooperation in 
controlling shipments of hazardous waste. Poland faced this 
problem a couple of years before Ukraine. Its lengthy border 
with Germany -- the world's largest manufacturer of these 
``products'' -- facilitated the immoral activities of companies 
involved in selling toxic waste. However, the Polish side 
adopted a strict law on shipping waste across the border. 
According to Greenpeace Ukraine, this is one of the best laws 
of its kind in the world. 
  Ukraine still has no legal footing for controlling this 
sector. A resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet in November 
1993 was not implemented because the Council of Ministers has 
been lingering in compiling the list of toxic substances. The 
problem of German waste shipped to Rivne, Nikolayev, and Ochakov 
has not been resolved, regardless of the investigation conducted 
by competent organs and negotiations with Germany on returning 
the waste ``to its native land.'' 
  The treaty with Poland is important for Ukraine first of 
all, 
because it includes a clause on prevention of transit of 
hazardous waste via the two states' territories. Thus, our 
ecological border has moved farther to the west.

Ambassador''] 
  [Text] A few days ago, H. Hotovchyts, minister for issues 
of protecting the population from the consequences of the 
accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant, had a 
conversation with Finland's Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary in Ukraine Erik Ulfstedt at the latter's 
request. The minister briefed the ambassador on what is being 
done to eliminate the consequences of the accident and to 
protect the population from them, and he explained how Ukraine's 
difficult economic situation affects this activity. 
  The ambassador pointed out that the conversation helped him 
to get a better understanding of the size of the catastrophe and 
of the need to urgently resolve the relevant problems, and he 
promised to inform his government about them. He showed 
interest in the minister's individual proposals on cooperation, 
in particular, on ways to utilize the timber from the zones 
contaminated with radiation.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Levandovskyy, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </F>
columnist: ``On the German Minister's Commission. Thanks to 
Yuriy Kostenko [Ukraine's minister of environmental protection] 
and Experts from Saxony-Anhalt, Ukraine Will Not Yet Become a 
Dumping Ground for Toxic Waste''] 
  [Text] For several months, the Ukrainian mass media have 
been carrying alarming reports on the uncontrolled dumping of 
German toxic waste in Rivne and Nikolayev oblasts. The 
``Greens'' and Ukraine's Greenpeace sounded the alarm. German 
officials kept silent for a long time. 
  Finally, in November [1993], at the request of Ukrainian 
Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to his 
German colleague Klaus Toepfer, a group of experts headed by Dr. 
Andre Radde [names as transliterated] arrived in Kiev. 
  For a week, the FRG specialists conducted identifications of 
toxic substances and investigated the circumstances of their 
delivery to Ukraine. In Rivne Oblast, between 50 and 70 tonnes 
of various substances were revealed (dyes, varnishes, putty, 
wax, tallow, and laboratory chemicals, including mercury), as 
well as 100 tonnes of slag, which are stored under the guard of 
chemical troops. 
  In Nikolayev Oblast, between 40 and 50 tonnes of such 
substances are also stored under proper conditions. There does 
not seem to be any acute danger for the population, but, of 
course, there exists a certain threat to the environment. 
  What part of the imported waste may be processed and what is 
to be done with the remaining substances will only be determined 
in Germany after an evaluation of the results of the inspection. 
The results will be reported to Saxony-Anhalt institutions, 
which, within the framework of their jurisdiction, are presently 
conducting a criminal and administrative investigation of German 
firms under suspicion that they have violated the Law on Waste 
Disposal. 
  The thing is, in the FRG lands, private contracts between 
firms (including foreign ones) are not controlled by federal 
organs of power. Economic ties are established directly. That 
is why competent bodies alone may determine the degree of 
responsibility of the entrepreneurs. 
  Unfortunately, the absence of a similar law in Ukraine makes 
it possible to import waste (secondary raw materials) on a 
perfectly legal basis. Smart dealers take advantage of this and 
fill their pockets under the pretext of saturating the market 
with raw materials, which are in short supply. It is impossible 
to rely solely upon the vigilance of the ``Greens'' or the 
enthusiasm of members of the Ukrainian Greenpeace Organization. 
  Ukraine's Supreme Council, by its decree of 17 November 
1993, 
already made the first step, having authorized the Cabinet of 
Ministers to adopt a list of groups of substances and materials 
belonging to the category of those dangerous waste materials, 
whose import to the territory of Ukraine is prohibited, and the 
Procedure for Issuing Licenses for Importing (Transit) of 
Secondary Raw Materials and Relevant Waste to the Territory of 
Ukraine. 
  It only remains to make the second step -- to fill in the 
blank spaces in the legislation, lest impudent entrepreneurs 
should make dangerous attempts to bring highly toxic substances 
to Ukraine. 
  I must point out, as a positive development, the meeting of 
the German experts with Ukrainian and foreign correspondents at 
the German Embassy in Ukraine. It is my impression that 
[German] Ambassador Alexander Arnot is particularly active in 
trying to help our state overcome various hardships in its 
present critical situation.

This Time?''] 
  [Text] The Kiev Kharkivskyy Rayon People's Court has begun 
to consider the case of violations of radiation safety rules and 
norms during the reburial in 1988 of radioactive waste from the 
territory of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Nuclear Studies 
Institute at a burial site that belonged to a special combine of 
a specialized production association subordinated to the former 
Ukrainian SSR Ministry of Communal Services (currently the 
Ukrainian state association ``Radon''). The cooperative 
``Dozimetrist,'' which included scientists from the Nuclear 
Studies Institute, Kiev State University, and the city 
sanitary-epidemic station, acted as a mediator between the 
Nuclear Studies Institute and the special combine. 
  As a result of the investigation, which lasted one year, it 
is believed that violation of rules during the transportation 
and burial of the waste created the threat of dangerous 
irradiation for Kiev's population. The former deputy general 
director of the specialized production association and the chief 
of the radioactive waste burial site are accused of these 
violations.

<F P=106> [Iryna Yashchembska report: ``Chemical Genocide Against the </F>
Ukrainian People Continues'' -- first paragraph published in 
boldface; words between slantlines published in italics] 
  [Text] In July 1993, NARODNA HAZETA (No. 25) carried a 
report on the results of an inspection by Ukraine's Procurator 
General's Office of the procedure for deliveries to our state of 
toxic chemical substances, pesticides, and plant-growth 
regulating agents, and their registration, storage, and 
utilization. 
  Let me remind you that the report dealt with the deliveries 
and utilization in agriculture of chemicals that cause 
considerable ecological problems and an extremely serious 
deterioration in the health of the Ukrainian population. The 
report concluded that a new genocide, this time a chemical one, 
had been started against the Ukrainian people. 
  The Procurator General's Office initiated eight criminal 
cases (one of them on economic matters) based on the results of 
the examination. It took upon itself the most involved case, 
which implicated officials of ministries and departments, and 
handed over the rest to local militia bodies. 
  Besides, demands and proposals were submitted to the 
Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers. They dealt, 
in particular, with the need to conduct a state-sponsored 
ecological examination of the ``List of Those Chemical and 
Biological Methods of Struggle Against Pests, Plant Diseases, 
and Weeds, and Those Plant-Growth Regulators That Have Been 
Permitted for Utilization in Ukraine's Agriculture in 
1992-1996'' (``List'') and suggested that the use of those 
preparations that raise any doubts regarding the negative 
consequences they may cause to human health and the environment 
must be temporarily suspended. 
  It is worth recalling at this point that Ukraine's Ministry 
of Health authorized the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute 
of Ecological Hygiene and Toxicology of Chemical Substances 
(UkrNDIGINTOKS) to carry out all work aimed at creating the 
``List.'' This was despite the fact that this particular 
institution had concluded direct agreements with foreign 
manufacturing plants on conducting experiments involving the 
preparations in exchange for hard currency. This was the main 
reason for the malpractice committed by the institute's director 
M. Motuzynskyy and his deputies A. Podrushnyak and A. Bolotnyy. 
They were the authors of the ``List'' (other specialists of the 
Institute learned about its existence only during the 
procurator's inspection), which included highly toxic, 
mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and other chemical 
substances. Some of the preparations had been banned in the 
manufacturing country, while others, such as, for example, 
``harness'' [kharnes] (the United States), were not even 
registered, because the date for the end of testing them is May 
1995. The ``List'' also includes the preparation ``tigam'' [not 
further identified], which was described by the former Union's 
State Commission in the following way: ``Highly toxic, 
possesses carcinogenic properties, causes dermatitis and 
allergic diseases...,'' or the TMTD, which is ``characterized by 
the harmful effect on sex organs and fetuses, may cause 
mutation, is teratogenic and carcinogenic, and impairs the 
reproductive function...,'' and other similar chemicals. 
  In December 1993 and January 1994, the Procurator General's 
Office checked the state of affairs. The time was not chosen at 
random. The sowing campaign will soon start, and it is 
precisely during these months that agreements are concluded with 
foreign firms on deliveries of pesticides. That is why the 
inspection was also preventive in character. Its task was to 
preclude possible crimes now, rather than state the facts of 
their perpetration later. 
  Unfortunately, even today, the situation does not give 
reason 
for optimism. No effective measures have been taken by the 
Cabinet of Ministers, Ministries of Health and Environmental 
Protection, or other institutions to eliminate the violations or 
abuse revealed by the Procurator's Office. The government 
commission set up last June by the directive of vice premier V. 
Demyanov, did not conduct the inspection properly and focused on 
the unjustified protection of leading officials, who violated 
the law (if you remember, it was precisely V. Demyanov who 
permitted the purchase and utilization, on 1,600,000 hectares of 
cornfields, of the preparation ``harness,'' which is hazardous 
to health). 
  The conclusions drawn by the government commission make it 
possible to assert that its members do not know the true state 
of affairs in the branch. Their conclusions do not correspond 
to objective circumstances, contradict the requirements of the 
current legislation, and do not take into account the interests 
of the state and citizens. For example, the members of the 
commission keep referring to the use, in foreign countries, of 
some of the preparations in question. However, the commission 
does not take into account the fact that Ukraine is subjected to 
much contamination, including radioactive. Nor are the low 
level of culture in using pesticides and the extremely 
inefficient state control, especially over the quality of 
agricultural products, taken into account. Today, more than 90 
percent of plant-growing products reach the consumer without 
being previously inspected. Such a situation prevails in all 
Ukrainian oblasts. Some chemicals have become global pollutants 
even of foodstuffs and not only of the environment. The staple 
foodstuffs alone were found to contain the traces of 72 types of 
pesticides, including those that are extremely hazardous to 
health: ``Dipterex, methyl parathion, DDT, phosphomile 
[fosfomil],'' ``copper'' and ``mercury'' compounds, and so on. 
Pesticides have been revealed in dairy products and even in baby 
food. Dairy products also contain preparations that are used 
for the treatment of the seed prior to sowing. 
Despite the alarming results of testing preparations that are 
imported into Ukraine, no measures are taken to at least 
restrict their utilization. 
  As a matter of fact, the entire territory of Ukraine has now 
been transformed into a ``chemical proving ground'' for testing 
extremely harmful substances purchased abroad. Foreign firms 
``study'' their preparations on ordinary agricultural lands, and 
not on experimental fields. Of course, the resulting produce is 
not destroyed, but is offered to the Ukrainian population for 
consumption. For example, the firm ``Monsanto'' (the United 
States) tested a mixture of chemical substances that do not even 
have names in Donetsk Oblast. (In the same oblast, the firm 
stores pesticides, the majority of which are not registered in 
Ukraine.) The same firm also conducted experiments in the 
``Boryspilskyy'' state farm in Kiev Oblast. Similar examples may 
be quoted for other Ukrainian oblasts. 
  The government commission headed by Academician Kundiyev has 
``overlooked'' this and many other problems. This is very 
strange, since in October 1992, Yu. Kundiyev gave a negative 
assessment of the aforementioned ``List.'' His conclusions on 
the carcinogenic, mutagenic, and other hazardous properties of a 
number of preparations became one of the reasons for conducting 
the procurator's examination. All the more unfathomable are his 
subsequent actions both as chairman of the governmental 
commission and, today, as head of the commission of experts 
expected to prove that the preparation ``harness'' may safely be 
used in Ukraine's agriculture. 
  The composition of the government commission, appointed by 
vice premier V. Demyanov, also suggests that its main task was, 
after all, to promote departmental interests. It included, 
first and foremost, agricultural experts and only two medical 
specialists: Academicians Yu. Kundiyev and Ye. Honcharuk. This 
is despite the fact that the inquiry by the Procurator's Office 
mainly raised the question of taking urgent measures to prevent 
the negative effect of pesticides on the health of the 
population. 
  Regarding Academician Honcharuk, it was, to put it mildly, 
unethical to include him in the commission. The thing is that 
he, jointly with UkrNDIGINTOKS' director Motuzynskyy and the 
latter's deputy Podrushnyak, had founded a small enterprise 
``Scientific Medicine.'' In December 1992, the Institute 
illegally transferred 1.5 million karbovantsi to the enterprise 
(the money was returned during the procurator's inspection). 
Despite such circumstances, Ye. Honcharuk, as a member of the 
commission, was inspecting the validity of the actions by 
Motuzynskyy and others. 
  It is a great pity that the governmental commission did not 
want or could not see or feel the significance of the extremely 
alarming problem: Owing to the greed of some officials and 
negligence and incompetence of others, Ukrainians are in danger 
of becoming transformed into mutants without a hope for the 
future. 
  The actions by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of 
Health are no more reassuring. They ignored the demands by the 
Procurator General's Office that the revealed violations of law 
be corrected. Ukraine's chief sanitary inspector V. Mariyevskyy 
and deputy directors of the UkrNDIGINTOKS A. Porushnyak and A. 
Bolotnyy have not been dismissed from their posts to this day. 
As regards Mr. Motuzynskyy, he feels very much in his element. 
He now heads a laboratory at the same Institute. Ties with 
foreign firms, the signing of agreements, and expert analyses 
have all remained in his hands. 
  Impunity has always given rise to new violations. For 
example, the state association ``Ukrahrokhim'' brought 
considerable quantities of the preparation 2.4 D, which is not 
registered in Ukraine, to Khmelnytskyy, Kharkiv, and Kirovohrad 
oblasts. At the same time, recently appointed chairman of the 
State Commission for Chemistry V. Petrunek, without coordination 
with the Ministry of Health, is issuing permits for importing 
unregistered preparations: The ``Bishevskyy'' state farm (in 
Donetsk Oblast) received the pesticide ``MON44068'' from the 
firm ``Monsanto,'' and the Rivne company ``Rise'' [Raiz] -- the 
foreign-made preparation ``40-percent dialene'' [dialen]. 
  It is alarming that officials of all ranks, from the 
minister 
to the head of a rayon plant-protection station, may issue 
permits for deliveries of foreign-made pesticides. For example, 
the preparation ``burex [bureks]-430FLO'' was brought into 
Ukraine and passed through the Customs with the help of a letter 
from the chief of the Holoshchanska rayon plant-protection 
station, and the herbicide ``aminopilek [aminopilek]-9'' -- with 
the help of a letter from the chief of the Rivne station. The 
same picture can be seen everywhere. The chemical genocide 
against the Ukrainian people continues. 
  Of course, the Procurator General's Office is taking 
measures 
to protect state interests. However, the resolution of many 
problems is outside its jurisdiction. It is necessary, first 
and foremost, to resolve all problems on the basis of 
legislation, and this is the prerogative of the government and 
parliament. 
  I will add this in conclusion: In December 1993 and January 
1994, the Procurator General's Office tried to check the local 
court proceedings on the relevant cases. It turned out that, by 
that time, they had already been stopped. An examination of the 
materials showed that the facts had not been properly checked. 
Even expert analyses were not done properly. The Procurator's 
Office canceled the resolutions on stopping these criminal cases 
and united them. Kiev's Internal Affairs State Administration 
is currently continuing the investigation. 
  As we can see, the law-enforcement bodies are doing 
everything possible to prevent the further poisoning of the 
country's environment and population. However, we hope that the 
Cabinet of Ministers, the parliament, and, in particular, 
candidates for the new Supreme Council, will include the 
ecological issue as a major issue in their programs and will, in 
the final analysis, be instrumental in stopping the chemical 
poisoning of the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Olga Kolinko, Ukraine deputy procurator </F>
general, conducted by Leonid Gashin: ``Fines (!) Are Being 
Squandered''] 
  [Text] Throughout the entire world there is a legal 
norm according to which those who pollute and destroy nature 
must pay. This is also stipulated by Ukraine's Law on 
Environmental Protection. Money exacted from enterprises, 
officials or just citizens is supposed to be used for the 
purposes of environmental protection. Seventy 70 percent of this 
money is to go for establishing nonbudgetary environmental funds 
under local soviets, and the rest of it is to go for 
establishing a state environmental fund. 
  Recently the Ukrainian procurator general checked up on 
fulfillment of the requirements of legislation regarding the 
establishment, formation and use of these funds. Olga Kolinko, 
Ukrainian deputy procurator general, tells about the results of 
this inspection. 
  Kolinko: Before talking about the environmental 
funds' receipt of funds and expenditure of them, it should be 
said that these funds do not yet exist in all oblasts. Often 
they are not established under rural soviets until after the 
procuracy has intervened. That was the case in Odessa, 
Kirovograd, Sumy, Cherkassy, Volynskiy and Zhitomir oblasts. 
Because of that, money collected for the violation of 
environmental-protection legislation and for the restitution of 
losses went into the accounts of the rayon finance departments 
or was left for the use of monitoring agencies. In 1991-1993 
environmental funds in Ukraine failed to receive at least 100 
million karbovantsy for this reason. 
  In other places, enterprises' payments were credited to the 
rayon nonbudgetary fund. In Perevalskiy Rayon, Lugansk Oblast, 
such a fund has been established under the rayon state 
administration, rather than under the rayon soviet. Another 
example in which payments have been misdirected: The Lisichansk 
Petroleum Refinery, in transferring 5 million a year to the city 
soviet's nonbudgetary fund, does not pay a single kopeck to the 
Belogorovka, Maloryazantsevo or Volcheyarovka settlement 
soviets, on whose land it is located. However, they should be 
the first to be compensated by the refinery for its harmful 
impact on land, bodies of water and air. 
  And very often people at the local level ``forget'' that 
payments for environmental pollution are supposed to go 
precisely to city and rural soviets. And the rayon and oblast 
soviets may receive only part of the payments for the use of 
natural resources. 
  Gashin: But do the soviets always receive those 
payments? 
  Kolinko: Unfortunately, no. Today a situation has 
developed in which payments are made only by conscientious--as 
strange as this may sound--polluters. The amount of those 
payments is supposed to be determined by the local state 
administration, and agencies of the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources are required to report 
allowable levels of discharge to them. However, the job of 
making the necessary calculations has been transferred to the 
enterprises themselves, and the agencies in question merely 
confirm the figures that are presented to them. Therefore, not 
wanting to pay, enterprises are in no hurry to make the 
calculations. 
  To this day, allowable levels of emission and discharge have 
not been set for more than 100 enterprises in Odessa, Donetsk 
and Zhitomir oblasts alone. And in Kupyanskiy Rayon, Kharkov 
Oblast, for example, one in every three enterprises is not 
making payments because of the lack of any set allowable levels. 
  The state also sustains considerable losses because of flaws 
in the recalculation of payments. Given today's inflation, 
delays play into the enterprises' hands, especially since local 
soviets and state administrations, and state administrations of 
the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
have not been exercising their powers to charge penalty fines. 
  There have also been cases in which enterprises have simply 
been relieved of payments for environmental pollution. This has 
been done either by agencies that lack the power to do so, or 
without grounds for doing so. 
  Gashin: And just how is the money that does 
actually end up in nonbudgetary environmental funds being 
utilized? 
  Kolinko: That is where the greatest number of 
violations were uncovered. For example, last year the executive 
committee of the Zolochevskiy City Soviet in Lvov Oblast 
allocated 4 million karbovantsy to hold a gala concert during 
the celebration of the city's 500th anniversary. Altogether, in 
1992 about 15 million karbovantsy was spent out of the 
nonbudgetary funds to build roads, landscape cemeteries, hold 
soccer tournaments and acquire equipment. In Kharkov monies from 
the fund were used to augment the social development fund and 
fund for the social protection of the population, and to provide 
loans, while in Yenakiyevo, Donetsk Oblast, such monies were 
used to improve the health of the employees of the city soviet 
executive committee, the tax inspectorate and the civil defense 
agency. 
  The most violations of this sort occurred in Kirovograd, 
Lugansk, Volynskiy and Ivanovo-Frankovsk oblasts and the Crimea. 
  The problem is that the statutes on nonbudgetary 
environmental funds that have been confirmed by nearly all the 
local soviets do not accord with existing legislation. This 
includes that part of the statutes that pertains to the funds' 
use. 
  Gashin: That's at the local level. What about the 
``center?'' 
  Kolinko: No better. Local deputies ``copied'' 
those very statutes from the Statute on the State Nonbudgetary 
Environmental Protection Fund that the government confirmed last 
year--a statute that also codifies the unlawful expenditure of 
``environmental'' money. Therefore, it is no surprise that over 
the course of 1991-1992 monies from the state fund were spent to 
index the wages of scientists working under contracts with the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, to 
support the journal RODNAYA PRIRODA, and to make contributions 
to all manner of funds. 
  One gets the impression that environmental-protection 
objectives are really going unnoticed. After all, last year only 
one-sixth of the republic fund was utilized. And this year, 
having 80 million karbovantsy and 20 million in hard currency at 
its disposal, the Cabinet of Ministers, based on a 
representation by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources, has confirmed an estimate of only 28 million 
karbovantsy. 
  That is not the end of the ``bad examples'' that the center 
has set for local governments. For example, Instead of 
transferring to the state fund 30 percent of the fines and sums 
paid in restitution for damages that had been collected, 
agencies of the Ukrainian Gosrybkhoz [approximate expansion: 
State Committee on the Fish Industry] spent more than 1 million 
to pay bonuses to their employees. Only at the procuracy's 
demand was the violation eliminated. Back last September the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources sent 
out a letter explaining that enterprises supposedly had to pay 
restitution for damages only when those damages were caused by 
the accidental discharge of pollutants. Following a protest by 
the Ukrainian procurator general, the unlawful explanation was 
withdrawn. However, for nearly a year the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources filed no claims 
for the restitution of damages. 
  Gashin: Why has such a widespread practice of 
ignoring the law become possible? 
  Kolinko: The soviets of people's deputies, local 
agencies of the state executive branch, and specially authorized 
state agencies, especially the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources, have made fundamental 
miscalculations and errors in setting their priorities for 
monitoring activities. There's the main reason. 
  And the violations of the law really are widespread, and 
they 
exist in every oblast, without exception. If we do not get rid 
of them, they could cause substantial damage to the state's 
interests. 
  Gashin: Has the procuracy already taken any 
measures? 
  Kolinko: Based on the results of the inspection, 
83 orders to eliminate violations have been issued, 63 protests 
have been lodged, and 147 claims have been filed for collection 
of a total of more than 80 million karbovantsy. Considering the 
seriousness of the situation, a representation has been made to 
the Cabinet of Ministers demanding the urgent elimination of 
violations. I. Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet, has been informed. 
  The government has responded rapidly to our efforts, the 
Supreme Soviet Commission on the Environment and the Rational 
Utilization of Natural Resources has expressed its gratitude, 
and reports have been coming in from localities where efforts 
are also being made to rectify the situation.

<F P=106> [UKRINFORM report: ``We Harm Ourselves and Nature''] </F>
  [Text] Last year, 282 cases of critical environmental 
pollution were recorded in Ukraine. They caused 1.3 billion 
karbovantsi [K] of damage. Almost all of these discharges 
affected water reservoirs. The greatest number of such 
accidents occurred in the following oblasts: 39 in Poltava 
Oblast, 27 in Ternopil Oblast, 22 in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, 18 in 
Kirovohrad Oblast, and 17 in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. One of 
every nine of the inspected facilities (virtually all those in 
Lvov Oblast) exceeded the norms for discharging contaminated 
waste. Reporting these figures, the Ministry of Statistics 
points out that, last year, inspectors prevented more than 6 
million cubic meters of liquid waste from being discharged into 
natural water reservoirs and 13,000 tonnes of dry harmful waste 
from being released into the atmosphere. Fines totalling K152 
million were imposed for violations of the nature conservation 
laws and more than 21,000 officials were called to account.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The European Community 
is still trying to keep alive its proposals for an energy tax, 
even if this means granting exemptions to the countries most 
opposed to the measure, an EC official said here Wednesday [2 
February]. 
  He was speaking after Jacques Delors, president of the EC's 
executive European Commission, told environmentalists earlier 
this week that he would continue fighting for the tax to the end 
of his presidency on December 31. [passage omitted] 
  But the EC official said Delors was prepared to concede 
exemptions ``to one or two countries'' if necessary to push the 
proposal through. 
  The energy tax aims primarily at reducing vehicle emissions 
of carbon dioxide. It was originally supposed to start at the 
equivalent of three dollars a barrel of oil and rise to $10 by 
the turn of the century. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Antonio Cerrillo report: ``Environmental Action Will Be </F>
EC's Economic Driving Force''] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- European Commissioner for Fisheries and 
the Environment Ioannis Paleokrassas has asserted that measures 
to preserve the environment will be the main source of job 
creation in Europe over the next few years. ``Protection of the 
environment will be the driving force for the growth of the 
European Union [EU],'' he said in a lecture delivered at the 
Catalan Employers for Europe organization, where he was 
introduced by its chairman, Carles Gasoliba, before a very large 
audience comprising representatives of the administration and 
industrialists. 
  During his address, Paleokrassas, a Greek conservative 
politician who was twice a minister in his country, outlined the 
main aspects of the EU's new environmental policy. He said that 
this seeks to banish the idea of industrial production based on 
the depletion of natural resources and replace it with a 
principle aimed at protecting and safeguarding this natural 
heritage for future generations. He also stressed that 
protection of the environment should not be just a policy in 
itself but should be a precondition for industrial expansion. 
  ``The new course in environmental policy (the Commission's 
white paper) is that economic and fiscal means should be used, 
instead of having recourse to the old methods of legislation and 
controls,'' among other reasons, ``because it has been seen that 
this is not effective,'' Paleokrassas told this newspaper. To 
this effect, the commissioner favored the view that products 
should include the environmental cost stemming from the natural 
resources which they deplete, the pollution which they produce, 
or the waste which they create. 
  Within this same strategy, he supported the EU Commission's 
decision to impose ecological taxes in order to increase the 
cost of using energy sources which cause carbon dioxide 
emissions, as a way to alleviate the greenhouse effect. He said 
that unless this method is used, the volume of carbon dioxide 
emissions would not be stabilized at the 1990 levels, which the 
EU had set itself as an overall target. ``If the carbon dioxide 
tax is not adopted, studies show us that it would exceed the 
1990 levels by 3 percent in the year 2000,'' he warned. 
  To the same effect, he supported Jacques Delors' proposal 
for 
``waging a crusade'' to extend this ecological tax to the whole 
world. ``The greatest danger is of these emissions increasing 
in the rest of the world, where there is no control,'' he added. 
  He refuted the idea that the economic crisis relegates 
environmental concern in this way: ``In Europe, measures in the 
environmental field will create at least 2.5 million jobs over 
the next five years, and other studies show that this figure 
could rise to 5 million,'' he stated. 
  Paleokrassas deemed generally ``insufficient'' the programs 
drawn up by the various countries in order to fulfill the 
commitments which they undertook at the Earth Summit (1992) in 
signing the Climatic Change Treaty, and asserted that only 
Europe has drawn up plans to combat the effects of a possible 
climatic change. 
  On the implementation of Community directives, he said that 
Spain in general carries out those concerning the protection of 
birds, ``but the degree of fulfillment is not so satisfactory in 
the case of public works and conducting environmental impact 
studies. Spain is in an intermediate position; it is not among 
the worst,'' he summed up.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Augereau: ``Nuclear Waste: </F>
Worldwide Problem''] 
  [Excerpts] Installation of Storage 
sites Is Posing Problems Everywhere in the World 
  Where should waste from nuclear projects be stored? How can 
it be done under conditions acceptable to all? The issue is so 
sensitive and the public is now so watchful and cautious that 
the governments of nuclear energy producing countries think 
twice before presenting their proposals. Ten years ago, who 
would have predicted the proliferation of mediators, sent to the 
front lines by public administrations, nuclear industry 
manufacturers, and brand-new agencies in charge of managing this 
waste, to inform, reassure, answer questions, and consider 
everyone's probing and apprehension before reaching any 
decisions? 
  Nuclear power can no longer be forcefully imposed; public 
administrations have understood this and have learned their 
lessons from the past. In February 1990 the Rocard government, 
aware of difficulties it would encounter if it imposed this or 
that site for storage of highly active waste from the nuclear 
industry, chose to halt hostilities with the determined 
population on 9 February 1990 and to let time do its work. Of 
course this decision was not completely devoid of electoral 
considerations, but excessive coercion eventually creates a trap 
which Rocard wanted to avoid by declaring a one year moratorium 
on the management of these awkward waste products. 
  The 30 December 1991 law on this issue has formed a 
legislative framework for any new steps in this regard and given 
mediator Christian Bataille the heavy responsibility of 
consulting constituencies and collecting voluntary proposals 
from communities interested in the installation of an 
underground laboratory for research on nuclear waste. This was a 
good initiative and about 30 such proposals came quickly to 
light. 
  Today, four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Neuse, and 
Vienne 
have been tentatively selected by Bataille (see LE MONDE of 6 
January) and the government has just authorized the Radioactive 
Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) to begin geophysical surveys of 
the sites. Here again, cautiously, the authorities will take 
their time for one to two years before reaching any decision. 
  Groundbreaking for the laboratories, which will cost 1.5 
billion francs each, cannot begin before the end of 1997 at the 
earliest, which means that operations would begin in 2002. This 
would be followed by eight years of research on site quality 
(nature of bedrock, water flow study, deeply-imbedded materials 
performance, and so on); this is because ANDRA is not scheduling 
materials storage before 2020 at sites that have yet to be 
determined assuming the program is authorized to continue after 
Parliament deliberations around 2010. 
  This surfeit of caution is not unique to the French 
authorities: all nuclear energy producing countries are facing 
the same type of problems. As a matter of fact, France is 
managing fairly well at present with its surface storage for low 
radioactivity waste at the Hague (Manche) which is filled, and 
at Soulaines (Aube) which has just opened. The only remaining 
problem is to so to speak, settle the delicate issue of 
permanent storage of highly active waste. One step has just been 
taken with Bataille's report. Many other countries wish that 
they were that far along. 
<H5>  Strong Local Opposition </H5>
  In Europe the situation has more facets as a few examples 
will illustrate. In Germany where disagreement is sharp, it is 
clear that all nuclear industry waste will be stored underground 
regardless of its radioactive level. Storage has already been 
established at two locations for low- and medium-activity 
radioactive waste: at the former salt mines in Morsleben near 
the old East German border, and at Asse (Lower Saxony). The 
latter has in fact been for some years, the site of 
international experiments for storage of high radioactivity 
waste. 
  Two other sites also in Lower Saxony are currently being 
discussed as possible storage centers. The first is in Gorleben 
where two wells are being drilled in a salt dome for high 
radioactivity waste, the first shipments of which may come in 
1994 and 1999 from France and Great-Britain. But work on this 
project has been stopped. The second is at the Konrad iron mine 
for less radioactive material. But its placement into service is 
being hotly contested between the federal government and the 
Lower Saxony authorities. 
  In Switzerland where there a research laboratory in granite 
already exists at Grimsel, nuclear industry waste is housed 
on-site at plants and research facilities, while waste resulting 
from other industry activity has been temporarily stored since 
25 November 1992 at a 9.3 million Swiss franc installation in 
Wurenlingen in the Argovie canton. For permanent storage, the 
Cooperative for Radioactive Waste Storage (CEDRA) approved in 
June of last year a center whose cost is estimated at 500 
million francs and which would be built in Wellenberg in the 
semi-canton of Nidwald. 
<H5>  Swedish Example </H5>
  But canton authorities are blocking current construction 
based on their recently acquired legal power to grant licenses 
for underground utilization. Many discussions must yet take 
place before Parliament issues a decision (in 1997?) on this 
proposed center whose operation could begin in 2005. As for high 
radioactivity waste, this is only the beginning. 
  Preliminary drilling intended to analyze the nature of the 
soil (granite and gneiss) has already been conducted in the 
northern part of the country in Bottstein, Leuggern, Weiach, 
Kaisten, Schaffisheim and Siblingen. Other drilling operations 
have been requested by federal authorities to prospect clay 
deposits in the Aar Valley and in the area between Baden and 
Schaffhouse. But as the JOURNAL DE GENEVE pointed out last 
summer, in Siblingen, the canton authorization procedure for 
drilling took six years while at the federal level it took one 
year and eight months. ``All that time to come to the 
realization that the site was not suitable...'' 
  Clearly waste management is not an easy matter and according 
to nuclear energy promoters it is hampered less by technical 
difficulties than by social and political problems. The country 
currently having the most success in resolving them is Sweden, 
whose early decision against reprocessing irradiated fuels at 
its plants has made the choices easier. 
  Sweden has an underground facility, the SFR, carved out of 
granite on the Baltic coast not far from the Forstmark plant, 
which since April 1988 has been used for permanent storage of 
low and medium radioactivity waste. At the same time the 
Stockholm government in the early 1980's commissioned an 
enormous underground storage center in Oskarshamm, the CLAB, 
intended for storing irradiated fuels from Swedish plants for 40 
years before they are permanently buried in the substrata of the 
country's two northern communes situated right in Lappland near 
Arjeplog and Overkalix (see LE MONDE 17 September 1992). 
  Discussions are underway to determine which of these two 
locations may receive these vexatious ashes. There is no hurry, 
even if it takes time to win over a very skeptical public 
opinion. This is why, in spite of CLAB's intermediate storage 
(CLAB received its first highly radioactive shipments in July 
1985), the Swedes want proof ``through a dress rehearsal'' that 
their permanent storage plan in granite is efficient. 
  The Swedish Fuel and Radioactive Waste Processing Company 
(SKB) has thus begun drilling a deep tunnel in granite at 
Orskarshamm near CLAB; this is the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory 
(HRL) which is intended to serve as proving grounds for the 
engineers. The whole facility should be completed at the end of 
1994 or the beginning of 1995. But unlike its Canadian 
counterpart, URL at Pinawa in Manitoba, this underground 
laboratory will not be converted to a storage site.

<F P=106> [``E.M.'' report: ``Austria Collects Signatures Against </F>
Temelin Nuclear Power Plant''] 
  [Text] The threat posed by the Czech nuclear power plant in 
Temelin near the border now leads to activities among the 
population: On the one hand, advance notices of damages at a 
value of 3 trillion schillings have been sent from Austria to 
the U.S. company Westinghouse. On the other hand, the 
environmental organization Global 2000 is starting a large-scale 
signature campaign: It calls on U.S. Congress deputies to 
prevent the financing of Temelin: ``The nuclear power plant 
project has already been rejected by the World Bank and other 
banks with reference to cheaper and safer alternatives,'' the 
lists of signatures say: ``Therefore, we are appealing to you 
not to support the short-term economic interests of the U.S. 
nuclear industry.'' 
  This campaign is supported by Education Minister Rudolf 
Scholten: ``If signatures are collected in schools, I endorse 
that.'' The first prominent person to sign is [singer] Rainhard 
Fendrich. Lists for signatures can be obtained at ``Global 
2000,'' 1120 Vienna, Flurschuetzstrasse 13, telephone 0222/812 
57 30. 
  Prague environmental activist Petr Hlobil of the Czech 
environmental organization ``Children of Earth'' believes that 
``the majority of the people in southern Bohemia are against the 
project.'' Organized resistance is already forming, according to 
Hlobil. Hlobil does not accept his government's argument that 
Temelin is necessary to close down the outdated coal-fired power 
plants in northern Bohemia. Until 1995-96 -- the earliest date 
of Temelin's coming into service -- most of the coal-fired power 
plants in the region will already have been closed down or 
improved. Only 430 of the 2,000 megawatts of Temelin will then 
be needed in northern Bohemia.

  [Text] The new building of the European Parliament in 
Brussels may have to be evacuated due to high concentrations of 
formaldehyde, a substance which is thought to be 
cancer-inducing. It is used in lining of conference halls and 
offices. Measurements have shown that the air inside the 
Parliament building contains three times more formaldehyde than 
the legal limit. The study dates from October and results were 
eventually disclosed by Paul Staes, a member of the European 
Parliament for the Flemish Green Party Agalev. New measurements 
were made last week and these have confirmed earlier findings. 
The air was analyzed after complaints from personnel at the 
European Parliament that they were getting headache and runny 
eyes inside the building. The air conditioning system is now 
working at all times in the building. 
  The problem at the European Parliament building is 
reminiscent of what happened to the headquarters of the European 
Commission in Brussels. That building was evacuated a number of 
years ago after asbestos levels were found to be dangerously 
high.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Ivan De Vadder report over video introduced </F>
by newscaster Martine Tanghe] 
  [Text] 
  Tanghe: Belgium will now sign the London 
Convention which forbids the dumping of low levels of nuclear 
waste into the sea. Over 60 countries signed this agreement 
late last year while Belgium abstained. The government has 
decided to sign the convention but wants to find a solution 
before the end of the year so that radioactive waste can be 
disposed of on land. 
  De Vadder: [video shows dumping of 
radioactiuve waste] Belgium was one of five countries last 
year that did not sign the international ban on the dumping of 
nuclear waste into the sea. France, China, Great Britain, and 
Russia also abstained. Until 1982, Belgium dumped low levels of 
radioactive waste in the Gulf of Biscay [off the Spanish coast]. 
A moratorium was introduced a year later and imposed a halt for 
10 years. When 67 countries declared themselves in favor of a 
ban on such dumping late last year in London, the Belgian 
Government decided to extend the moratorium until the year 2000. 
This decision was dictated by the problems of nuclear waste 
processing with which the Belgoprocess plant in Dessel [northern 
Belgium] is now dealing. The objective is to get rid of part of 
the nuclear waste for good somewhere in our country. As long as 
no decision had been made on this subject, the government 
hesitated in signing a ban on sea dumping, not because it 
intended to resume dumping waste into the sea but because it did 
not want to rule out this option. Belgium will now adhere to 
the ban and Environment Minister Sentkin wants to find a final 
solution to the disposal of low-yield radioactive waste in our 
country by the end of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by Tapio Mainio: ``Clear-Cutting Forests Continues </F>
in the North''] 
  [Text] Clear-cutting and deep ploughing have not vanished 
from the forests of northern Finland. There is no limit on the 
size of clear-cut tracts in privately owned forests. In state 
owned forests, on the other hand, 30 hectares is the maximum 
size of any single clear-cut tract. 
  ``Every year a few clear-cut tracts exceeding 30 hectares 
are 
cut. The size of the clearing is ultimately for the landowner to 
decide, although we do recommend smaller clearings,'' says Tommi 
Lohi of Kemijarvi, the director of the Forestry Board of 
Northeast Finland. 
  Deep ploughing, also called rim ploughing is still a 
commonly 
used way to turn over the soil surface in northern forests. 
  ``About 60 percent of the harvested areas within the 
Forestry 
Board of Northeast Finland region is ploughed. The remainder is 
treated with milder operations such as either spot treatment or 
harrowing,'' Lohi adds. 
  The Forest Service will be ploughing forests yet this year 
and only in the far north. The methods used are either the deep 
ploughing or edge ploughing. Deep ploughing creates a trench 
even 1 meter in depth. The trench from edge ploughing is 20 to 
30 cm deep. 
  The Forest Service will replace the practice of ploughing 
with ditch tussocking, in which the stones dug up by the 
ploughing will be replaced into the trench. Additionally sticks 
and stumps can also be placed in the trenches to prevent the 
excessive leaching of nutrients from the forest. 
  In ditch tussocking the trenches are left 15 meters apart, 
whereas in normal forest ditching they are about 6 meters apart. 
  ``We are not inclined to start ditch tussocking, for it is 
twice as expensive as ditching. These modernizations seem to be 
jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Ditch tussocking just 
might make the harvest clearings into brush jungles,'' Martti 
Rautiainen, operations chief of the Kuusamo Common Forest, says 
skeptically. 
<H5>  Committee Debating Methods </H5>
  Just a few years ago the Kuusamo Common Forest made 
clear-cuttings of over 100 hectares but now, according to 
Rautiainen, each harvest area is, at most, 30 hectares in size. 
  ``Now the importance of forest borders for forest 
regeneration has been noted,'' adds Rautiainen. 
  At the current time the broad-based, environmental program 
committee of the Ministry of the Environment is debating, among 
other things, forest soil turning methods and the size of the 
clearing. 
  ``The maximum size or soil-turning method could either be 
recommended or stipulated as a condition for support or 
financing,'' says Juhani Viitala, the chairman of the committee 
and head director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 
  In 1950, the Forest Service harvested, in Pudasjarvi for 
example, from clear-cuttings as large as 230 hectares, whereas 
the current maximum clearing size is 10 hectares. 
  ``The dramatic change took place in 1969, when a maximum 
size 
of a clearing was established at 30 hectares. That was when we 
could see the problems created for forest regeneration by 
harvest clearings of even thousands of hectares,'' relates Heino. 
  In 1978 the Forest Service increased the maximum size of a 
clearing to 50 hectares, and in 1985 reestablished it at 30 
hectares. 
  Now the size of the clearing in northern Finland is 10-30 
hectares, depending on site growth conditions, and at high 
elevations the size is even smaller than this. ``The same 
applies to recommendations to privately owned forest management 
also,'' adds Heino. 
  There are differences in the way harvests are conducted on 
privately owned forests, depending on the attitude of the forest 
landowner or forest products corporation.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Rauno Sairinen: ``Finland's Forestry </F>
Strategy Faulty''] 
  [Text] The German magazine, DER SPIEGEL, has initiated a 
discussion on Finnish forestry. The Finnish representative in 
Greenpeace, who was interviewed as a result of the article, 
criticized our forest products industry with some very frank 
words. Defenders of our forest products industry were irritated. 
  The reaction indicates that at least the level of our 
discussion on environmental issues has not kept pace with 
Central European standards. We accept Greenpeace's highly 
visible campaigns against Norwegian whaling and Russian dumping 
of nuclear wastes in the sea. But when our own methods of 
dealing with our forests were critically focused on, our 
attitude changed. The esteemed environmental organization 
instantly became the irresponsible destroyer of Finland's forest 
products. 
  One article in a large circulation periodical and hysteria 
takes over in the country's industry. What's going on here? 
Researcher Ilmo Massa wrote in the opinion page of the HELSINGIN 
SANOMAT that the Central European environmental criticism has 
the marks of the environmental imperialism practiced by the 
prosperous industrial nations. 
  It is true that Greenpeace is not always interested in 
conditions dictated by local economies. It would, however, be 
overly simplistic to equate the DER SPIEGEL article with the 
publicity on the Amazon rain forest. There is a difference in 
scale between these issues. The environmental movements of 
industrial countries have not systematically attacked Finland's 
forest products industry. Further, Finland is itself an 
industrialized country, and it is good that the environmental 
criticism hits us once in a while, instead of always the 
impoverished countries. 
  The DER SPIEGEL discussion reveals the frailty of Finnish 
industrial and forestry strategy. The arguments of the forest 
products industry are characterized primarily by a 
self-enveloping defensiveness. The situation is not analyzed 
self-critically but the reaction is like that of an offended 
little boy. 
  For a long time the possibility of making conservation of 
the 
environment the trump card in Finnish competition with others 
has been a topic of discussion. The government's Forest Service 
has, however, retreated only in tiny steps on northern 
environmental disputes. The state has not consented to 
significant cuts in production objectives of the Forest Service. 
The silvicultural practices have been modernized slowly and the 
forest products industry has not accelerated the process, but 
has retarded it. The results of the failed strategy are evident 
from the DER SPIEGEL publicity. 
  The forestry doctrine serves one lord, the paper and 
cellulose industry. The mechanized forest industry of ours that 
proliferated in earlier years has faded away. This kind of 
condition has long been accepted as being for the common good. 
  Now this common good and acceptance is becoming fragmented. 
It appears that, in the long term, the forest products industry 
will not be able to even maintain its image advantage. The 
ecology of the forest has undergone drastic changes even though 
the forest has long meant many things in Finnish minds. It 
serves more than the cellulose boilers. There is more out there 
than rows of seedlings of one tree species and hard-to-traverse 
ploughing scars. 
  Hunting, berry picking, fishing, orienteering, capturing 
pictures of nature, hiking in familiar and unfamiliar forests 
are all important things. The forest is also utilized by 
tourism, sawmills, the furniture manufacturers, artistic 
handicrafts, food products industry etc. New forest products 
could be developed, but sufficient variety of tree and plant 
species can no longer be found. 
  There has been much positive progress in our forest 
management practices. But the clamor over the DER SPIEGEL 
article shows that our forest management discussion is plagued 
by a reality-ignoring polarization. As long as the 
confrontational attitudes between the forest products industry 
and environmental movement, as well as between employment 
concerns and ecological priorities remain, the discussion will 
be stuck on a naive level. 
  Finland needs defending of multiple use of the forest. 
Should 
yet one more group interested in the forest be organized in 
Finland, a group that would be based on local enterprises and 
know-how, as well as cultural priorities that consider the 
forest valuable?

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: ``Possible Sites in Gard, Haute-Marne, </F>
Meuse, and Vienne for Waste Storage Study Laboratories''] 
  [Text] Paris--Four departments, Gard, Haute-Marne, Meuse, 
and Vienne have been suggested as possible sites for installing 
two underground research laboratories for the storage of nuclear 
waste, according to a 5 January announcement by Christian 
Bataille, chief negotiator for these installations. Bataille 
also announced that ``everything indicates that the government 
will present proposals in the next few days,'' and he added that 
only two sites would ultimately be picked. 
  More thorough investigations led by the Bureau of Geological 
and Mining Research (BRGM) are planned for 1994 in those 
departments. It will take another year to officially announce 
the two sites chosen for installing the laboratories, which are 
stipulated by the law of 30 December 1991. 
  While four geological strata--clay, granite, schist, and 
salt--are considered suitable for holding highly active and 
long-lived nuclear waste, which is the most dangerous--the 
Bataille project has retained only the clay and granite options 
after reviewing the initial geological data. 
  Bataille and his assistant, the prefect Jacques Monestier, 
selected six likely departments out of thirty which applied to 
the negotiators last year--Gard, Marne, Haute-Marne, 
Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse, and Vienne. This selection was later 
narrowed down to the four mentioned earlier in this article. 
  Bataille made several recommendations in the report he 
presented to the ministers of Industry, Environment, and Land 
Management, Messrs Gerard Longuet, Michel Barnier, and Charles 
Pasqua. He suggested that ``the dialogue'' initiated under his 
authority be ``pursued at the national and local levels.'' When 
the time comes to build the storage facility--in 2008 at the 
latest--he requests that the possibility of waste storage 
reversibility resulting from research conducted by the Atomic 
Energy Commission (CEA), among others, be taken into account. 
Finally, according to him, the future of the laboratories once 
their work is accomplished should be ``guaranteed and 
formalized.'' 
  Each laboratory, employing 150 people including about 30 
scientists, should require an investment of one and a half 
billion francs and will serve for fifteen years. Operating costs 
for each are estimated at 70 million per year in addition to 60 
million annually for local development.

<F P=106> [Article signed Philippe Chambon: ``Trees That Breathe </F>
Tomorrow's Air''] 
  [Text] In 50 years' time, the atmosphere will contain twice 
as much carbon dioxide as it does today. How will the oak, the 
beech, and the spruce deal with it? A French team has attempted 
a simulation. 
  In the heart of the Auvergne hills at 
Saint-Maurice-es-Allier, 10 or so trees are already living in 
the air of the year 2050, closely monitored by the INRA's 
[National Agronomic Research Institute] forestry research center 
from Nancy. Jean-Pierre Garrec's team has started a rather 
unusual experiment here: growing trees in a CO2- rich 
atmosphere. 
  The young trees -- oak, beech, and spruce -- have been 
placed 
in a chamber with an open top into which scientists inject a gas 
mixture containing 700 ppm (parts per million) of CO2, twice as 
much as in the air we breathe today. That is the proportion of 
carbon dioxide predicted for the middle of the next century. 
The calculation is simple since the graph plotting the increase 
of CO2 in the atmosphere is widely known and easy to 
extrapolate. As for the open-topped chamber technique, this has 
hardly any effect on the natural environment, which is why it 
was preferred to simple greenhouses. 
  Saint-Maurice-es-Allier has the advantage of being a former 
thermal spa, supplied by the Sainte-Marguerite spring. 
Researchers therefore have a free and inexhaustible source of 
carbon dioxide. The excess gas extracted from the mineral water 
is all the more interesting because it does not have the same 
isotopic composition as the CO2 in the atmosphere, allowing 
scientists to examine how it is metabolized by the plants that 
absorb it. 
  This experimental station was opened two years ago. It plays 
host to researchers from several European laboratories and parts 
of the IGBP (International Geosphere Biosphere Program). It 
receives subsidies from the EC and the French ministries 
concerned (environment, research, and agriculture). 
  Jean-Pierre Darec explains: ``Until now, the impact of 
atmospheric changes on trees was only studied over short 
periods. Now we can hope to carry out this work over six years 
or more.'' That is a short time compared with the life of a 
tree, but the researchers, who have already obtained some 
interesting results, hope to be able to draw some exclusive 
conclusions. 
  The Nancy team specializes in analyzing the parts of the 
plant that come into contact with the atmosphere, i.e. the bark, 
the skin of the leaves, and the protective wax that covers them. 
Samples taken at Saint-Maurice are analyzed at Nancy where 
Didier Le Thiec and Martin Dixon try to assess the changes to 
the outer tissue of the trees. The first thing they noticed is 
that there were a lot fewer stomata -- a type of leaf pore 
involved in regulating gas absorption -- on the trees living in 
the atmosphere of 2050. It appears that the plant reacts to the 
excess CO2 by reducing its number of stomata, while absorbing 
more carbon dioxide than in today's atmosphere. In fact, this 
phenomenon is already documented. In certain regions of Italy, 
natural emissions of CO2 through the soil produce a similar 
effect on wild plants. However, the air in these regions 
changes constantly, affected by the wind, for example. In 
Saint-Maurice, on the other hand, the parameters are kept 
constant and allow much more reliable measurements to be taken. 
  Other teams have been examining the herbaria of our 
forefathers. The leaves conserved in herbaria dating from the 
end of the 18th century contain many more stomata than leaves of 
today. Analysis of the air bubbles trapped in the polar ice 
caps tells us that at that time, the CO2 content was just 280 
ppm. How far can this phenomenon go without disrupting plant 
metabolism? Is it reversible? These are questions for which 
the Nancy team hopes to find the answers. 
  The experiment is also aimed at determining whether the 
changes to the atmosphere can influence the penetration of 
phytosanitary products and the sensitivity of plants to insect 
or fungal attack. 
  While, for the time being, the tests are limited to CO2, a 
similar line of research is underway to measure the effects on 
trees of increases in the tropospheric ozone levels (the ozone 
at an altitude of between 0 and 15 km). ``When we have the 
initial results, we will inject the Saint-Maurice chambers with 
the amount of ozone predicted for 2050,'' announced Jean-Pierre 
Garrec. ``We are not afraid of discovering catastrophic effects 
with the CO2, but with the combination of gases it is quite 
another thing.'' Preliminary results are already raising serious 
questions. 
  The researchers were naturally expecting the plants to grow 
better in a CO2-rich atmosphere, since this gas is essential to 
the production of biomass through photosynthesis. This is 
effectively what is occurring in the INRA's experimental 
chambers, except that the growth rate differs surprisingly from 
one species to the next. Oak, in particular, grows much faster 
than spruce. ``This difference led us to question forestry 
balances,'' said Jean-Pierre Garrec. It is possible that the 
increase in CO2 could favor certain species to the detriment of 
others and so upset the diversity of species in our forests. 
However, this is a hypothesis that remains to be verified. The 
data supplied by the INRA station is still very fragmented and 
too new to enable us to draw any long-term conclusions. 
  In the meantime, the Nancy experiments have also attracted 
the interest of nurserymen, and in particular those that supply 
towns, since municipalities often ask for fully-grown trees, 
notably to avoid vandalism. Studies into the growth of trees in 
a CO2-rich atmosphere could offer them an attractive 
alternative: moving from the sapling to the young tree in a 
record time.

  [Text] Berlin -- Owing to environmental protection measures 
and production cuts, pollution has decreased considerably in the 
new laender since unification. According to a report by the 
Halle Economic Research Institute, the average production of 
dust and sulfur dioxide decreased by 50 percent in areas with 
high pollution, and by a third in areas less exposed to 
pollution. It was, above all, the conversion of coal-fired 
heating systems to oil and gas- fired ones in more than one 
million private households that has caused this positive effect. 
  In the electricity sector the funds for fighting dust, 
sulfur, and the disposal of ash, gypsum, and water are expected 
to increase to 20-30 percent of the basic investment. Of the 28 
billion German marks of investment in plants expected by 1997, 
some 40 percent will, however, have to be used for repairing the 
power network.

<F P=106> [``na''-signed report: ``Decrease of Public Share To Be </F>
Yardstick for Financial Policy Decisions''] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In its basic program, to be adopted 
at the fifth all-German party conference between 21 and 23 
February, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will enlarge its 
policy model of social market economy by an ecological 
dimension. The new basic party program advocates an 
``ecological and social market economy.'' 
  The party's new basic program will realize and update the 
existing basic program, adopted at the Ludwigshafen party 
conference in 1978. The party conference submission commission 
rejected proposals by the Christian-Social workers and several 
land organizations that had spoken out against expanding the 
term ``social market economy'' to read ``ecological and social 
market economy.'' The ecological extension of the social market 
economy is one of the most important innovations the basic 
program has seen. 
  The draft program that the delegates have been recommended 
to 
adopt says that the CDU wants to step up the use of market 
economy instruments and control mechanisms in order to achieve a 
more gentle treatment of nature and the environment. The 
objective of the ecological and social market economy is 
combining economy, social justice, and ecology. 
  The CDU considers the principles of polluter and precaution 
the basis of an ecological order. It calls for a system where 
producers and consumers meet the costs resulting from their 
failures in environmental precaution and from using the 
environment. This can only be guaranteed if the costs result in 
honest prices. With this, the CDU wants to stimulate and 
encourage people to be gentle on the environment. 
<H5>  Ecology in Tax Law </H5>
  Based on the individual's responsibility in the ecological 
and social market economy, the CDU speaks out on using all 
cooperation opportunities before implementing government 
regulations. But it leaves no doubt that ecological regulations 
with legal orders and prohibitions, critical values, 
requirements, and licensing procedures are necessary to 
efficiently tackle the immediate danger to humans and the 
environment. 
  But in order to increasingly use industry's efficiency and 
innovativeness to serve the environment, the CDU wants to 
increase the use of ecological control elements in the tax law, 
environmental fees, compensation regulations, and liability 
rules. 
  The CDU basic program also reflects the intensive debate on 
Germany as a business location. The draft program says that as 
a country with a scarce supply of raw materials and high labor 
costs, Germany relies heavily on the efficiency and 
innovativeness of its people and industry. ``With our capacity 
to achieve the top results we have to concentrate on top quality 
products and production methods. The cycles of technological 
progress are becoming ever shorter, requiring a speeding up of 
innovations.'' 
<H5>  Strengthening Business Location Germany </H5>
  For this reason, Germany's competitiveness as a business 
location depends very much on high standards in research and 
development, as well as the use of new technologies such as 
biological and genetic engineering, information and 
environmental technologies. Environment-friendly products and 
technologies will be very important in the future. ``By further 
developing our economy to become an ecological and social market 
economy we can both strengthen our leading role in the field of 
environmental technologies and secure an important advantage for 
the future.'' 
  In order to strengthen Germany standing as a business 
location, the CDU suggests: 
  -- Decreasing the public share and cutting taxes and fees; 
  -- Improving education and vocational training, science and 
research, and its infrastructure; 
  -- Promoting future-oriented technologies and environmental 
protection; 
  -- Privatizing and cutting subsidies; 
  -- Deregulating and decreasing bureaucratic regulations and 
requirements, and speeding up licensing procedures; 
  -- Introducing more flexible working hours and longer 
machine- operating hours; 
  -- Improving information and transport infrastructures; 
  -- In particular, securing social peace and social 
partnership. 
  The program turns against protectionism. It says that 
Germany as an export-oriented industrial nation depends on free 
trade. Protectionism blocks the dynamics of the economy and 
prevents innovation. 
  The consequences of reunification are mainly described in 
the 
basic program's chapters on fiscal and financial policy. These 
chapters say that the framework conditions of financial policy 
changed drastically for a longer period of time following 
reunification. ``In order to promote the growing together of 
Germany at a high speed, we have had to put up with higher 
public debts, an increase in the public share, taxes and public 
expenditure for a certain period of time. This must, however, 
be followed by reducing indebtedness, consolidating all public 
households, reducing the public share in the gross national 
product, and easing the tax burden in the medium term. The 
draft says that a reduction of the public share with 
consolidated public households is the yardstick for all fiscal 
policy decisions. 
The CDU wants to create the conditions for reducing debt by 
redefining public tasks.'' ``We will have to redefine 
priorities in the public services, what the state and social 
insurance systems can do, which public services can be 
controlled via market relations, and which services we will have 
to cut.'' The CDU considers structural changes and shifts, cuts 
in spending, and higher efficiency necessary. ``By 
deregulating, cutting bureaucracy, and privatizing we want to 
make public services more efficient and cost-effective.'' The 
CDU wants to increase the share of public tasks that are 
financed by special funds, such as prices and fees, and 
co-insurance. Also, it calls for a comprehensive cut in 
subsidies. Subsidies should be limited in time and be 
digressive. 
  In order to increase clarity and justice, and to simplify 
administration procedures, the CDU wants to link the tax system 
and social benefits that are not based on contributions. 
<H5>  Tax Burden To Be Cut </H5>
  In the medium term, the CDU wants to reduce the overall tax 
burden and restructure the tax system. The draft program says 
that the direct tax burden on productive factors such as capital 
and labor is too high. ``We want lower direct tax rates, but a 
broad tax base with less concessions and exemptions.'' This is, 
at the same time, a simplification, and thus increases tax 
equity. The CDU says that it will have to increase taxes on 
consumption, especially energy consumption and environmental 
fees. ``By restructuring the tax system along economic and 
ecological lines, we are setting the course for further 
development of the ecological and social market economy.'' 
  In terms of taxes, real capital must not be at a 
disadvantage 
in relation to financing capital. The CDU wants to cut 
nonprofit-linked taxes and to speed up the harmonization of 
taxes within the European Union.

  [Text] In 1995 and 1996, Deutsche Bundespost's postal 
service, in conjunction with well-known industrial partners, 
will conduct large-scale trials with electric vehicles powered 
by a zinc-air system. 
  The field trial, preparations for which began back at the 
beginning of 1994 [as published], will be based on the Greven 
mail center near Muenster in Westphalia. The large-scale trial 
grew out of studies by the postal service as to how part of its 
diesel vehicle fleet could be replaced by propulsion systems 
that caused less pollution. A novel zinc-air power system 
emerged as a promising prospect, although it is not without its 
expert critics as regards the overall ecobalance. 
  However, initial tests, involving outside inspectors, on the 
new power system installed in a trial vehicle went off 
successfully at the TUeV [Technical Monitoring Board] for 
Bavaria and Saxony, its power and output values, which far 
exceeded those of conventional batteries, and its ecological 
acceptability proving particularly attractive. 
<H5>  Autonomy Range Considerably Extended </H5>
  The trials centered on use in the postal service, where 
requirements are three or four times higher than in the private 
transport sector. Whereas electric vehicles with an accumulator 
weight of 350 kg have had a range of about 40 km to date, the 
new technology permits journeys of at least 300 km. 
  The large-scale field trials scheduled to begin in 1995 will 
set out primarily to establish whether the zinc-air power system 
is economically viable and what its infrastructure requirements 
are. The latter is necessary because the power cells cannot be 
charged like conventional storage batteries: The electrodes 
have to be changed. The ``worn-out'' electrodes are 
subsequently regenerated, after which they are ready for reuse. 
This is why large-scale field trials can only be performed with 
major fleet operators such as the postal service. 
  In addition to the postal service, in the role of project 
leader, and Electric Fuel Limited, the inventor of the zinc-air 
system, other well-known firms have agreed to take part in the 
field trial. Some firms and town councils also want to 
participate in the trial with parts of their own fleets.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: ``More Effective Waste Water Treatment With </F>
the Biogas Tower Reactor''] 
  [Text] Anaerobic biotechnical waste water treatment in 
bioreactors is today already being used by the food industry, 
pulp production and paper manufacturing companies. The field of 
bioprocessing technology at the Hamburg-Harburg Technical 
University (Professor Herbert Maerkl, Denickestrasse 15, 21071, 
Hamburg) has now, in cooperation with Preussag Noell 
Wassertechnik GmbH, developed a new type of bioreactor concept 
for increasing the decomposition effects. 
  As reported by Maerkl, anaerobic biotechnical cleaning 
methods are generally held to be less effective than aerobic 
ones. This is due to the slow rate of growth of the anaerobic 
microorganisms. However, the decomposition effects per gram of 
biomass are comparable to those of aerobic microbes. For that 
reason, if it is possible to increase the biomass in the 
reactor, anaerobic methods are also very effective. This 
increase has been achieved with the biogas tower reactor from 
Hamburg by using the sludge bed process. Another problem with 
anaerobic bioreactors is transferring the generated biogas to 
the outside. Gas production can be so high that disposal is 
impossible to deal with or would lead to a loss of biomass 
through flotation. This problem is also solved by the tower 
reactor. Gas suction equipment has been built into the reactor 
container at various heights. This makes it possible to dispose 
of gas even at low levels. Technically, the suction equipment 
works by adding pockets in the form of sloping metal sheets in 
the reactor volume. They partition the reactor into several 
compartments connected with each other and catch the rising 
biogas. The gas bubble formed under the sheet can be drawn off 
through a vent placed there. By regulating the gas extraction at 
the various heights, it is possible to regulate the gas content 
so as to be uniform throughout the reactor. But the gas bubble 
under the pockets has other advantages as well. By means of the 
free surfaces formed on the liquid, floating biomass particles 
are also kept down. Therefore, the gas extraction is possible 
without loss of biomass. The pockets can also help when mixing 
the reactor content. It is important for the decomposition 
effect that the microorganisms and the added waste water are as 
evenly distributed as possible. Since some microbes live in the 
form of symbiotic agglomerates, this blending must have as 
little gravitational force as possible. This problem is 
elegantly solved in the biogas tower reactor. 
  If the gas under the pockets is not removed, it continues to 
rise upward over an overflow edge. Through built-in flow 
channels this creates a circulating flow in the liquid. It can 
be controlled by the level of gas removal. In this way various 
blending intensities can be regulated in the various 
compartments of the reactor. The requirement to achieve good 
blending in the lower reactor areas and a high storage capacity 
for the biomass in the higher areas is easily met. By properly 
regulating the blending, the inhibiting effect of hydrogen 
sulfide, which is created from sulfate in the waste water, can 
also be reduced. 
  At this time a 20-meter-high reactor with a diameter of one 
meter is being operated as a pilot facility. It has turned out 
to be successful in treating yeast waste water.

  [Text] 1993 was the year of wind energy. The market for 
this clean and renewable energy source is experiencing a strong 
boom. According to the German Wind Energy Institute (DWI), the 
German wind energy park accumulated a total of 100 megawatts of 
rated output in 1993 (70 megawatts in 1992). One of the reasons 
for the increase, along with Federal and state funding programs 
and the selling price of 16.5 pfennigs per kilowatt hour 
guaranteed by the current input law of 1991, is the clear 
tendency to build large plants with a rated output of at least 
500 kW, now being produced serially by several manufacturers. 
Experts anticipate that within 2 years at the most windmills 
with rated output of a megawatt and more will be available in 
series. 
  The tendency to larger size has continuously increased the 
affordability of windmills, according to the rule of thumb, 
``the bigger, the cheaper.'' Today it is possible for windmills 
in windy areas, generally situated on the coast, to produce 
current at a cost of 8 to 16 pfennigs per kilowatt hour, which 
is scarcely more expensive than energy from conventional power 
plants. Armin Keuper of the DWI anticipates that at these sites 
wind energy plants could be functioning even without state 
funding within 5 to 7 years at most and be ``commercially 
successful.'' That is why more and more professional investors 
are getting involved with wind power along with the communes and 
associations of environmentalist citizens. Even banks have 
discovered wind generators as investment possibilities. 
  The move to larger plants is amazing in view of the fact 
that 
at the very beginning a large-scale project which foundered took 
the wind out of the sails of the wind power movement. The 
socalled ``Large Wind Energy Plant,'' popularly known as 
``Growian,'' was shut down in 1987 after a four-year test run 
because of technical flaws. After the failure of the 
three-megawatt generator and the dropping of the project by the 
disappointed major companies the industry went for small, simple 
plants, ``away from technical development at one fell swoop and 
towards progress in small steps,'' as Keuper says. Such steps 
have brought about the development of wind technology from 
plants under 100 kW to today's size. Thus energy utilization per 
rotor surface has doubled over the last 10 years; wind current 
has gradually become about 30 percent cheaper since 1988. This 
was also helped by manufacturers' lowering of prices, which was 
made possible in part by increased productivity in serial 
production and was partly forced upon them by increasingly 
strong competition in the marketplace. 
  Volker Friedrichsen, managing director of the company Vestas 
Deutschland GmbH in Husum, says, ``Technical improvements were 
achieved with the jump to each new size level because of 
increased experience.'' The Danish parent company is the largest 
international producer of wind energy plants. Their robust 
construction methods, rooted in agricultural technology, and 
gradually enhanced by modern technology, is very successful in 
the marketplace; the proof is the 4,300 wind wheels they have 
installed all over the world. This has not prevented other 
manufacturers from looking for success with innovative and 
technically demanding ideas. These include wind wheels with 
electronically regulated rotor blade installation for optimal 
wind utilization, with a variable rotation rate instead of a 
fixed one, and most recently also with a driveless generator, as 
offered by the company Heidelberg Motor GmbH in Starnberg or 
Enercon GmbH in Aurich. Technology pioneers are particularly 
hoping for greater economy based on higher efficiency from these 
new developments. 
  However, this advantage has not yet appeared. So far, in 
Keuper's professional opinion, there are ``hardly any 
differences'' between the plant concepts available on the market 
in price per kilowatt hour. Other experts point out that for 
enduring market success the plants have to establish themselves 
not only in Germany, but also on the world market. Here the 
traditional plants are considered to be proven, reliable 
technology. This reputation, which encourages business with the 
developing and emerging nations as well as with the Eastern 
European states, still has to be earned by high-tech windmills.

<F P=106> [Article: ``Pollution -- the Burning Question''] </F>
  [Text] It is an uncomfortable fact that industry's upside 
of creating jobs has a necessary downside of polluting the 
environment. 
  Because of that discomfort, the issue of how effectively to 
deal with hazardous toxic waste produced by industry has been 
fudged by successive governments over the years. Quietly, 
thousands of tonnes of toxic waste have been dumped or exported 
both legally and illegally in the absence of comprehensive 
regulations. 
  For years there has been talk about a national toxic waste 
incinerator for Ireland, and in the present decade that talk has 
become a shouting match. Few issues can evoke such emotion as 
former Environment Minister Padraig Flynn discovered when he 
asked DuPont to float a proposal for a 32-county incinerator to 
be based at Derry. The resulting uproar and mobilisation of 
protest in the town scared DuPont off the idea and it was 
shelved. 
  But the national toxic waste incinerator is back. The 
current 
minister, Michael Smith, is known to be four-square behind the 
idea, mooting it on several occasions before he devoted a 
three-day conference at Trinity College, entitled 
Hazardous Wastes: Options for Management, to the 
subject. 
  Mr. Smith has declared that the incinerator is a nettle 
which 
has to be grasped, but that he wants a public debate on the 
subject before a decision is reached. His main argument is that 
the dumping of hazardous waste throughout the country in 
landfill sites is creating ``little time bombs'' and that 
incineration is the preferred option in other countries. But 
environmental groups like Greenpeace claim such facilities could 
cause cancer and other health complications among people living 
nearby. 
  The problem with this particular debate is the dearth of 
reliable figures which the department itself has admitted. 
  The most up to date statistics produced by the Government 
show that there are at least 27 hazardous substances produced in 
this country by industry and services. They contain variously 14 
different properties which make them hazardous, whether they 
are, for example, explosive, toxic or carcinogenic. The 
departmental figures also show that 66,000 tonnes of toxic waste 
was produced. These figures are, however, six years old. 
  More recent figures are supplied by the Environmental 
Research Unit. Trouble is, their 1991 estimates put the amount 
of waste produced at only 36,400 tonnes. 
  During one of last week's sessions, the minister agreed, 
following a hasty and frank meeting with environmental groups, 
that more recent figures would be sought as a matter of urgency 
before the debate resumed. But even then there is concern among 
environmentalist that the data, which is supplied under EU 
guidelines by local authorities, will still not be reliable. 
  According to senior counsel for one of the environmental 
groups, many county councils cannot supply comprehensive, 
up-to-date figures on toxic waste disposal because of lack of 
funding. ``As well as that there are thousands of tonnes of 
waste which are not accounted for. It is very possible that 
people are hiding toxic waste and that they won't reveal it 
unless there is some kind of waste amnesty.''

  There is a considerable amount of on-site toxic incineration 
done in Ireland, 9,906 tonnes in all, according to the 
Government. Some of it carried out by hospitals to very low 
standards, according to Earthwatch. Of the 83pc of waste which 
is dealt with here (the rest is exported, mainly to the UK and 
Finland), 47pc is recycled, 2pc is chemically treated, 15pc is 
incinerated and 14pc is dumped in landfill sites. 
  These figures however, give no indication of the amount 
dumped illegally. Eolas have reported that between 4,000 and 
5,000 tonnes of toxic chemical wastes disappeared between 1985 
and 1989. No-one knows where these may have gone but they 
probably ended up on waste tipheads or in the sea. A report by 
the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas in 
1988 revealed severe heavy metal contamination in an area off 
Howth where Dublin Corporation dumps sewage sludge. 
  One of the main sources of toxic waste is the chemical 
industry, a sector nurtured by the IDA and the great white hope 
for home-based jobs for Irish graduates. As a result of 
inducements to pharmaceutical industries, Ireland is now the 
12th largest producers of pharmaceuticals in the world. But it 
is an industry which produced heavy amounts of waste: 35,323 
tonnes of organic solvents, 12,189 tonnes of chlorinated 
solvents and 6,305 tonnes of asbestos, in 1988, for example 
  The chemical/pharmaceutical industry does, according to the 
Government, recycle large quantities of certain kinds of wastes, 
such as solvents, both organic and chlorinated. But frequently 
reclamation is too expensive and difficult, with on-site 
incineration the main alternative. 
  Elsewhere, significant amounts of waste are generated by 
industries involving metal processing, electronics, crystal 
glassware, aircraft maintenance, optical products, metal 
products, video tape production and even sheep dips. Included in 
the global definition of waste there is the cloudy stuff in jars 
that we all keep in our garden sheds. 
  The line-up in favour of a national incinerator includes the 
Government and an array of business organisations, both large 
and small, with IBEC at the forefront. Brian Leech, an engineer 
at the Department of Environment, argues that an incinerator 
would be subject to a strict EU directive limiting air emissions 
and the type and quantity of waste disposed of, and would be 
further subject to regulation by the recently created 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
  IBEC argues that incineration at home is preferable to 
export 
for incineration and the creation of special landfill sites 
which will just ``lock [the waste] away underground where it 
remains a problem for future generations.'' 
  According to Matthew Moran, director of industrial policy 
for 
IBEC, the amount of air emissions from a national incinerator 
would actually be less than domestic fire and vehicle emissions 
from an estate of 200 houses. 
  The anti-incinerator stance is based on both economic and 
health considerations. Greenpeace warns that an incinerator 
would be flagged on the front of IDA brochures for foreign 
investors, and that a study of Germany showed that women living 
near such facilities had higher levels of dioxins in their 
breast milk than those living elsewhere. 
  Patricia McKenna, of the Green Party, warns that dioxins 
emitted by incinerators could cause cancer, miscarriages and 
genetic disorders. 
  The main argument by environmentalists is that waste 
reduction and even elimination should be preferred over waste 
incineration. Although IBEC recognises the economic benefits of 
waste reduction, it is unconvinced that promoting it does away 
with the need for an incineration facility. 
  According to David J. Lennet, a U.S. environment attorney 
attending the Dublin conference, there is a well established 
hierarchy of options for waste management with reduction at 
source, recycling, and treatment at the top of the hierarchy. 
  ``In the United States there is a move to push priorities as 
high up the hierarchy as possible. Incineration is generally low 
down on the totem poll. At the same time there is an economic 
payback with treatment and recycling whereas there is none with 
incineration.'' 
  But Lennet's principle argument is that before any of these 
considerations are dealt with, information must be freely 
available. While not even the Irish Government knows for certain 
how all the toxic waste in this country is dealt with, the 
debate about information on toxic waste, says Lennet, ended in 
the US 15 years ago. 
  ``The Freedom of Information Act brought in then meant that 
all the relevant information was freely accessible. Every 
document relating to toxic waste is publicly available whether 
the waste is generated by government or industry and is compiled 
in a biennial report published by the US Environmental 
Protection Agency. Yet in Ireland, for many people, today is the 
first time this information has been heard.'' 
  ``If there is to be any semblance of trust then things must 
be put on an equal footing so that the strengths and weaknesses 
of all the arguments can be explored.'' 
  Whether or not the authorities make a better play at 
informing the public, the row about the incinerator will gather 
steam. A sum of &pound;40m has been allocated for waste 
facilities, 
including a toxic waste incinerator, under the National 
Development Plan, and it has already been suggested that a site 
for an incinerator could be chosen at Cork Harbour or Shannon 
Estuary. But once the Government makes up its mind, and if it 
chooses to ignore the environmental and health arguments, then, 
given the experience in Derry, the issue will move out of the 
rarefied halls of academic debate -- and on to the streets.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: ``The Problem Of </F>
'Biodegradability'. Materials And The Environment.''] 
  [Text] An increasing awareness of the environment has 
resulted in research being instigated into new and 
environmentally friendly materials, such as biodegradable 
plastics. Initially the creation of these biopolymers was held 
up by various different problems, but at the same time essential 
basic knowledge was being acquired and the 'biodegradable' 
phenomenon has recently been defined in a better way than ever 
before. In other words, biopolymers are well on the way to full 
development. 
  In the meantime, various `biodegradable' plastics have 
appeared on the market which have been evaluated too light, such 
as those mixtures which were often blends of polyethylene and 
modified starch. They were sold under the principle of 
environmental friendliness, but in fact they were worse than 
traditional plastics. Micro organisms only break down the starch 
component, while the polyethylene fragments are diffused 
directly into the environment. There they are digested by birds, 
which are often unable to survive such a diet. All of this has 
done perception of the environmental character of biological 
plastics no good at all. 
  ``It has been a very good learning experience,'' said Dr. 
Bert Tournois, divisional head of the Agrotechnological Research 
Center, ATO, in Wageningen. ``If a plastic is being marketed as 
biodegradable, then the polymer really does have to be 
biodegradable.'' According to Tournois, this means that it is 
highly necessary to be able to define biodegradability in one 
way or another. That, therefore, has been one of the subjects 
into which ATO has been carrying out research. 
<H5>  Biological Breakdown Test </H5>
  ATO-DLO [Agrotechnological Research Center-Division 
Agricultural Research] has been very involved over the last few 
years researching pure biopolymers, particularly in connection 
with modified starch. In the first instance, the relationship 
was examined between a specific modification to the starch 
molecule and the final quality of the plastic. This research is 
progressing well, and ATO now has at its disposal a form of 
structural properties sample card. The result is that by means 
of specifically aimed modifications in the structure of the 
starch polymers, the properties of the bioplastic can be chosen 
very precisely. This involves characteristics such as 
brittleness, strength, elasticity, water attraction and 
repelling features, and so on. According to Tournois, ``One of 
the most important properties in these new materials is, of 
course, their biodegradability, and this property had in fact 
not been properly defined until recently. A great deal of 
progress has been achieved in this field in recent years.'' 
  ATO has developed a number of tests in which the biological 
breakdown can be determined, a package which is not only 
applicable to bioplastics but is also of interest for a wide 
group of materials, ranging from paper and wood to adhesives, 
rubbers, and coatings. A biological breakdown test for solid 
components appears, in fact, to have been a gap in the market. 
Until recently there had been standardized methods for liquid 
waste matter, but not for solid materials. Above all, what 
exactly is `biodegradability'? 
  As Tournois explains, ``If something dissolves, it doesn't 
necessarily mean that it is also biodegradable. The easy 
tendency is to say that biopolymers have been biologically 
broken down when you can no longer see them. That is not the 
case. We feel that the biological breakdown needs to be 
described as a chemical change which is initiated by a 
biological activity.'' 
<H5>  Breakthrough </H5>
  ATO has therefore made an inventory of the tests which 
existed previously, and afterwards started considering what a 
standard test for bio-destruction should be like. In particular 
they have sought contact with standardization bodies such as the 
European CEN [European Committee for Standardization], and the 
Dutch Standardization Institute, NNI. These efforts have led to 
a number of standardization tests for four different features: 
anaerobic or aerobic, wet or dry. ATO has in the meantime made 
these tests commercially available, and according to Tournois 
there is great interest, not surprisingly. Following the 
problems that occurred with the first so-called `biodegradable' 
blends, it is now of vital importance that the term should be 
given real meaning. Using a standardized test, business, 
industry, and materials developers will be able to work out how 
their new product can be broken down by micro organisms, even 
under which circumstances and within what time scale. A 
breakthrough, Tournois feels. 
<H5>  Outstrip </H5>
  The perception of the relationships between structure and 
properties, and the development of a standardized biological 
breakdown test, have brought the introduction of more and 
improved bioplastics closer. That means, however, that research 
into polymers is still moving rapidly. In fact the biopolymer 
technicians are rapidly overtaking the petrochemical polymer 
technology. Whereas the conventional plastics industry can rely 
on more than 40 years' experience, the bioplastics industry is 
still at the crawling stage. However, the catching up is taking 
place very fast indeed, not in the least because much of the 
groundwork has already been covered by the petrochemical 
industry. Meanwhile, various bioplastics have been developed, 
such as [polyhydroxyalkanoaten] polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA's), 
of which polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most well known. 
They are produced by micro organisms which store the polymers 
in the shape of little balls within the cell. By adapting the 
process and by choosing a specialized breeding ground, it 
appears to be possible to let bacteria produce certain PHA's 
more or less `on measure'. These so-called fermentation 
polymers are still very expensive, despite the fact that the 
price per kilo has dropped over the last few years from about 60 
Dutch guilders to around 10 guilders. 
  Another category covers polylactids or polylactic acids. 
Initially this advanced degradable plastic seemed to be far too 
expensive, and it was used primarily for medical applications, 
such as surgical stitching thread. It now seems possible to 
produce it at a much cheaper price, by withdrawing the lactic 
acid raw material not from sugar, but for instance to prepare it 
from potato waste or from whey. A further cost reduction 
appears possible as a result of increasing the production 
capacity. In the meantime there are a number of relatively 
large installations in operation in the United States and Japan 
(see POLYTECHNISCH WEEKBLAD Number 45, 1992). Such 
installations can now produce the polymers for approximately 5 
guilders per kilo. Protein plastics, such as gluten, can cost 
even less and the same applies to modified starch polymers, the 
price of which is expected to be not much more than that of 
polyethylene. 
<H5>  Biopolymer Center </H5>
  The biopolymer industry is at the starting line and the 
first 
products are already on the market, such as shampoo bottles made 
from PHB and French fries bags created from modified starch. On 
the research front, too, work is being done on biopolymers, for 
instance at the Universities of Twente, Leiden, Utrecht, 
Groningen, Eindhoven's Technical University, and naturally in 
the research institutes, not least at ATO-DLO in Wageningen. 
  Recently an official center for biopolymers was set up at 
ATO, where centralized research is being carried out into some 
eight or nine different biopolymer types. It is a relatively 
large and excellently equipped center, in which around 60 
researchers will be working. The new center is not intended to 
remain a purely national concern. According to ATO, the 
institute must achieve international status.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Membrane Absorber Removes SO2 From </F>
Waste Gases''] 
  [Text] The TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied 
Natural Science Research] has developed a membrane absorber 
which removes 95 percent of the sulphur dioxide from waste 
gases, as became clear from tests in the potato flour plant 
Avebe. The collected sulphur dioxide can be recycled. A 
membrane absorber is a device which brings gas in contact with 
fluid. It consists of a series of hollow fiber membranes, 
through which a fluid passes. The noxious fumes flow on the 
surface of the fibers, with some being absorbed by the fluid. 
In the membrane absorber, the stream of fumes is crosswise to 
the stream of fluid. The advantage of this is that the 
reduction of pressure is small and the unwanted oxidation of 
sulphite to sulphate is low.

Vanvolsem in Rio de Janeiro: ``Brazil To Send Back 300 Tons of 
Toxic `Waste'''] 
  [Text] Brazil is returning to Britain 300 tons of toxic 
materials exported by a British firm as fertilizer. 
  The consignment of copper and zinc, described on import 
documents as ``micronutrients for use as a fertiliser,'' was 
impounded by the Sao Paulo State Environment Protection Agency 
and found also to contain the poisonous metals arsenic, lead, 
mercury and cadmium. 
  Copper and zinc could be used in minute amounts to enrich 
tropical soils deficient in trace metals. 
  Produquimica, the Sao Paulo fertilizer company which 
received 
the shipment, said it was supplied by the Islington firm, London 
Metals. 
  The Warwickshire Waste Regulation Authority said the 
cocktail 
of metals involved were capable of poisoning people, plants or 
animals. 
  The environmental group Greenpeace said the materials, 
regardless of how they were described, were waste, because they 
were the residue of an industrial process. 
  They are seeking to hold up the incident as an example of 
the 
legal loophole under which toxic waste, properly described, may 
be exported to Third World countries for ``recycling,'' though 
exports of waste for dumping and incineration are banned. 
  The company which supplied the material to London Metals, 
Metallic Extractors of Water Orton, Birmingham, describes the 
material as a ``standard product'' controlled under regulations 
governing the recycling of metals. 
  Metallic Extractors confirmed the material included lead, 
cadmium, arsenic and mercury in small quantities and that it had 
supplied a complete analysis of the product with it. The company 
said it did not know the material was going to Brazil. London 
Metals refused to comment. 
  Jose Roberto Falconi, regional director of the Agency, said: 
``The material was being shipped back yesterday on our orders 
after tests showed it did not fulfil import requirements.'' 
  At the least, say industry sources, the incident proves that 
the legal definition of what constitutes waste is far from 
clear. If the material is legally found to be technically waste, 
it could yet be proved that London Metals should have had 
different export documents. 
  The Department of the Environment is investigating the 
incident.

<F P=106> [Report by science editor Roger Highfield: ``Sellafield: </F>
Who Is Hit If the Worst Happens?''] 
  [Text] It hasn't happened yet. But should an accident 
occur at Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, 
the path of a radioactive cloud across Britain can be plotted 
instantly. 
  The hypothetical ``footprint'' of pollution caused by a leak 
and borne on prevailing winds can now be predicted using a 
computer model. And a couple of days can make all the 
difference between radioactive fallout spreading over 
Scandinavia, or falling in Britain's back yard. 
  A small-scale version can also reveal how the location and 
height of a smokestack at a chemical plant affects local 
pollution. ``We could predict five days ahead when there will 
be a problem with a factory,'' said Robert Chadwick, 
environmental product manager at the Meteorological [Met] 
Office, which has developed the model. 
  The Met Office hopes to use the model, which can incorporate 
weather forecasts, as a tool to predict air quality, such as the 
risk of ozone or nitrogen dioxide pollution under certain 
weather conditions. 
  When the Met Office unveils its new generation of computer 
models next month, Whitehall, local councils, pressure groups 
and environmentalists are expected to show interest in the 
predictions, which can be produced for as little as 250 pounds. 
  The Government will rely on the computer model to highlight 
areas at risk from acid rain across the globe and to predict the 
fallout in the event of a catastrophic nuclear accident. 
  The Met Office's Nuclear Accident Response Model has shown, 
for instance, that the radioactive plume released by a nuclear 
accident is diluted more during a hot day in summer than a cold 
night in winter. The distance the plume of radioactivity 
travels can depend on the presence of a faster, mobile, 
nonturbulent layer of air above the explosion. At night, the 
cool still air can make this layer a few metres thick, while it 
could be as much as a mile on a summer afternoon, enabling the 
plume to travel a long way. 
  The model was developed in the wake of the world's worst 
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in 1986, when it became clear 
that there was a need for a way to assess the risks to the 
public created by an airborne plume of radioactivity. A 
smattering of dots moving across a computer screen can aid 
crisis management by showing how radioactivity spreads, or the 
effect of smoke sent up by a major fire or volcano. 
  ``Just select your accident and we can forecast the 
effects,'' said Roy Maryon, one of its developers. 
  In the case of Chernobyl, it took a few days before the 
world 
was aware of the accident. Now ``hindcasts'' based on weather 
patterns can track the pollution over five days from the moment 
of release . 
  The computer was put through its paces by Noel Nelson and 
Karl Kitchen, who helped to develop the model. They simulated a 
nuclear accident at Sellafield -- site of the western world's 
worst leak, in 1957, when it was known as Windscale. 
  They chose two different days last month to stage a 
hypothetical nuclear accident, and after the computer had 
processed the relevant weather data it plotted the gradual 
spread of radioactive particles across a map. Had the accident 
occurred on January 15, within three days north-easterly winds 
would have wafted the pollution by turns across southern 
Ireland, Wales, the West Midlands, the south coast as far east 
as Brighton, then Devon, Cornwall and the coasts of northern 
France. 
  By Jan 18, the winds had turned towards the east. ``We see a 
plume passing across the country to the North Sea,'' Mr. Nelson 
said. Had this been the date when a leak began, only the 
northeast coast of Britain would have received fall-out, while 
Scandinavia would have felt the effects 48 hours later. 
  Other computer plots show how radioactivity would have been 
washed out of the atmosphere by rain, creating distinct areas 
where fall-out would concentrate. Within 36 hours of the Jan 15 
emission, the worst hotspots would have been in northern France, 
with most of Wales and the West Midlands almost as badly hit. 
  Mr. Chadwick said he could have done with such a warning in 
1986, when he was rained on as Chernobyl's plume passed overhead. 
  The Met Office's computer model contains details of nuclear 
plants across the planet. It is also linked to a national 
radiation monitoring network, called Rimnet, so that its 
predictions can be checked and refined. A major European 
experiment, Etex, will be conducted this year to see how well 20 
such computer models predict the movement of an inert tracer gas 
released from Brittany. 
  The model is already part of the Department of the 
Environment's emergency plan for nuclear accidents.

  (Report by Charles Clover, Environment Editor: ``Shoppers' 
Levy Planned To Fund Recycling''] 
  [Text] Eight out of 10 households will have doorstep 
collections for bottles, cans and paper for recycling by the 
year 2000. 
  The scheme, to be funded by a levy of one penny on every 10 
pounds worth of supermarket goods, was presented to Mr. Gummer, 
Environment Secretary, by 28 leading companies yesterday. 
  It should enable Britain to recycle 58 percent of its 
packaging waste by the end of the century and is intended to 
fulfill Britain's commitments under a new EC packaging directive. 
  The voluntary scheme will be run by a new industry body 
called VALPAK and will cost nearly 200 million pounds a year. 
That is less than a tenth of a much criticised 2 billion pounds 
a year recycling scheme in Germany which Britain has accused of 
swamping Europe with German refuse. 
  Mr. Gummer called on leading businesses such as Marks and 
Spencer, Sainsbury's, Coca Cola, Tesco and Procter and Gamble to 
draw up a scheme last year. 
  Yesterday he repeated his threat that legislation would have 
to be introduced if the plan did not work. 
  The industry plan, published yesterday, aims to extend 
doorstep collection and ``high-density'' bottle and can bank 
schemes to three million homes by 1996. Mr. Mike Clasper, 
managing director of Procter and Gamble and head of the Producer 
Responsibility Industry Committee steering group which thought 
up the British scheme, said the voluntary plan offered ``real 
benefits for the environment at little cost to consumers.'' 
  Mr. Gummer said that Britain was obliged to meet EC targets 
which require the recovery of 50-65 percent of packaging within 
five years. 
  ``I made clear when we invited the packaging industries to 
produce a plan last year that the alternative to an industry-led 
scheme would be Government action, which was likely to be more 
costly, more onerous and less to the liking of industry,'' he 
said. 
  ``I repeat that message today -- `doing nothing' is not an 
option. I therefore urge all companies who make, use or sell 
packaging to participate in discussions on the plan during the 
next two months.'' 
  ``As I said last July, we are quite prepared to move towards 
a legislative approach if need be, though we prefer the 
voluntary route.'' 
  As Mr. Gummer welcomed the plan, industry sources reported 
that furious disagreements broke out between the 28 firms 
involved in a last-minute meeting on Friday. Procter and Gamble 
and Coca Cola are understood to favour more collecting from 
doorsteps, as they have done at a pilot scheme at 
Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, while other companies favour 
concentrating on bottle banks and paper igloos. 
  One industry source said: ``This scheme is a mess. We are 
now at five minutes past midnight and we're still all over the 
place.'' 
  A press conference at which the Producer Responsibility 
Industry Committee report was due to be presented to the public 
yesterday was mysteriously cancelled. 
  Incpen, the 20-year old Industry Council for Packaging and 
the Environment, issued a strong statement immediately 
criticising the voluntary approach adopted by Mr. Gummer, which 
it said would not compel all industries to participate . 
  Mr. Peter Davies, chief executive, said: ``We support the 
concept of this scheme but it must be followed immediately by 
legislation to ensure compliance.'' 
  The environmental group Friends of the Earth said that 
Britain appeared to be doing only the minimum necessary to 
comply with EC law. 
  Mr. Benedict Southworth, recycling campaigner, said: 
``Industry has been unable to agree among themselves, let alone 
agree on a plan.''

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover, environment editor: ``Major </F>
Warns of Pain in His `Green' Plan for Britain''] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister gave warning of ``painful 
political action'' to protect the environment at the launch 
yesterday of a ``green'' action plan that promises higher fuel 
taxes and a city curb on cars. 
  The Government's follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit, an 
environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four 
documents -- nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in 
the surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall. 
  The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable 
Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of 
travel, particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise 
to reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future 
demand for transport.'' 
  Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite 
painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental 
objectives.'' 
  He admitted he ``did not expect to see people dancing in the 
street'' at the thought of road pricing. 
  He said that Britain's imposition of VAT on heating and 
lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road pricing had 
already gone further than most other countries, but denied these 
would impose an intolerable burden on the economy. 
  An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet 
future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the 
overall environmental strategy, Mr. Major introduced the 
following documents: 
  -- The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how 
Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000. 
  The document shows for the first time that Britain will 
achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global warming -- 
including methane and CFCs -- of five percent. It commits 
Britain to setting targets after 2000 but not what they will be. 
  -- The Biodiversity Action Plan -- sets out 59 specific 
commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness. 
  -- The Forestry Action Plan -- shows how Britain will 
increase forest cover. 
  Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who 
will 
advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by 
Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an 
unofficial adviser at Downing Street. 
  The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of 
National 
Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's 
statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission 
on Environmental Pollution, and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president 
of the Royal Society. 
  Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the 
Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable 
Development which would bring together industry, local 
authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental 
policies. 
  The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's 
environmental initiative'' in consultation with local 
authorities, churches and community groups. 
  Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from 
Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith, Labour 
spokesman for environmental protection, said the four reports 
contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to action.'' 
  The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said 
the key Strategy document was ``full of `coulds,' `ifs' and 
`maybes' when what the country needs is `whys,'`whats' and 
`whens.''' 
  The Green Party complained the Government ``lacked the 
courage of its convictions'' and the World Wide Fund for Nature 
described the announcement as ``a lost opportunity.'' 
  -- An entire protected meadow famous for butterflies will be 
destroyed as part of a project by British Coal to extract three 
million tons of coal from an open-cast site. 
  West Glamorgan county council yesterday approved an 
application to develop open-cast mining on 800 acres of hillside 
above Glynneath, West Glamorgan, over nine years which will 
create about 140 jobs.

<F P=106> [Article by A.J. Mcllroy: ``Beaches Left Polluted by Rubbish </F>
of 28 Nations''] 
  [Text] British beaches are being polluted by waste dumped 
illegally from shipping traced to 28 different countries, 
according to the Marine Conservation Society. 
  Many stretches of coastline were in a ``scandalous'' state 
with tons of debris and sewage-related waste strewn around, the 
society said yesterday. 
  Typical of items dumped by passing shipping were aerosol 
cans 
and a log book of shipping channels from Germany; a milk carton 
from India; a shampoo bottle from Japan; two batteries from 
Poland; a plastic sauce bottle from Spain; a drinks container 
from China, and a large plastic drum, margarine tub lid and 
plastic bottle from Holland. ``All the items had their own 
language on the debris, ruling out the possibility the items had 
been bought and disposed of in the UK,'' the society said. 
  The society was reporting on Beachwatch '93, a 
clean-up operation of 121 beaches it launched last September 
with Reader's Digest. 
  ``The major source of plastic waste was from shipping,'' 
said 
Miss Cait Loretto, marine science officer with the society. 
``This shows that existing legislation is not only ineffectual 
but is also being widely ignored.'' 
  ``The maximum fine for catching an offender is &pound;450 
in the 
UK. In the United States a cruise liner was recently fined more 
than &pound;200,000 for dumping plastic -- now that is something 
like a deterrent.'' 
  She said the Environmental Protection Act 1990 put the onus 
on local authorities to keep public places up to a certain 
standard of cleanliness -- a standard many beaches failed to 
meet. 
  ``Some beaches are regularly cleaned from May to September 
but this still fails to ensure that the majority are free from 
litter.'' 
  The findings of Beachwatch '93 are based on the 
results of the clean-up campaign during which more than 1,000 
volunteers cleared 33 tons of rubbish from 121 British beaches. 
  A total of 114,880 items found included 51 percent made of 
plastic ``providing a real threat to marine life.'' Eleven 
percent were sewage related, among them condoms, tampons, panty 
liners, cotton buds and nappies. 
  The society said it wanted to put pressure on the Government 
for better legislation, better disposal facilities and better 
sewage treatment ``so our beautiful beaches can be made safe and 
pleasant for all.''

``Government's `Green' Record Is Attacked by Its Own Expert''] 
  [Text] The Government's ``green'' economics guru broke 
ranks yesterday to attack its environmental record, criticising 
the &pound;23 billion road-building programme and failure to 
control traffic growth. 
  The attack by Prof. David Pearce, proposer of the 
Government's ``green'' taxes on fuel, will cause embarrassment 
on the eve of the Prime Minister's launch tomorrow of 
environmental strategy for the next 20 years. 
  Prof. Pearce will publish research this week showing that 
the 
&pound;15 billion raised from road taxes each year is dwarfed by 
&pound;25 billion in ``social costs'' of road use -- noise, 
pollution, wear and tear on roads, congestion and accidents to 
pedestrians. If the motorist was to pay the real cost of using a 
car, he said, road taxes would need to be nearly &pound;10 
billion 
more, nearly double what they are now. 
  Prof. Pearce, adviser to former Environment Secretaries 
Patten and Heseltine, says his research demolishes the argument 
of lobby groups such as the AA and RAC that motorists get ``a 
rough deal'' because he pays &pound;15 billion a year in tax and 
only &pound;6 billion is spent on road building. 
  ``We have done something that the Department of Transport 
should have done. If they did their sums properly we wouldn't 
have such a rosy picture of the benefits we get from the roads 
programme,'' said Prof. Pearce, head of environmental economics 
at University College London. 
  ``If you were to start to charge for using the road, you 
would need to charge the motorist for the pedestrians killed 
each year and the fact that he causes congestion to someone 
else.'' 
  ``Similarly, no one currently charges the motorist for the 
social cost of the nitrogen oxides and the carbon dioxide that 
his car emits.'' 
  Prof. Pearce, who sits on two Government advisory 
committees, 
says the Government's proposals for motorway charging, aimed at 
raising money to spend on roads, do not go far enough to stop 
escalating traffic growth. 
  He said: ``I'm highly sensitive to the argument that giving 
a 
higher priority to protecting the environment would cost 
industry money. But the Government has done no work on how much 
it would cost, or how it could be paid. It has simply dropped 
the idea.'' 
  ``I believe that this change can be engineered to be good 
for 
the individual, good for the country, good for economic growth 
and good for the environment.'' 
  He said his attack on Government policies arose from ``sheer 
frustration.'' He had ``finally run out of patience'' after five 
year of working with Government. 
  ``We've all been extremely fair to them, addressing our 
criticisms internally. I remember saying when I got a copy of 
that White Paper, `Is this it?' It was all the repackaging of 
old policies.'' 
  ``There was nothing new and no imagination. I expect the 
Sustainable Development Strategy, which Mr. Major publishes this 
week, will be exactly the same thing.'' 
  Prof. Pearce reflects the frustration of a mounting number 
of 
the Government's closest advisers who feel that Mr. Major's 
Government has promised to use market incentives instead of 
regulation to address environmental problems, but has held back 
from introducing measures such as motorway charges and landfill 
taxes to back its convictions. 
  He is critical of leading civil servants, whom he accuses of 
having ``a vested interest in not upsetting the applecart.'' 
  ``Somewhere along the line we've run out of imagination. And 
nothing has been helped by Downing Street,'' he added, in a 
veiled reference to Mr. Major. 
  Prof. Pearce's new book Blueprint 3: Measuring 
Sustainable Development -- a follow up to Blueprint 
for a Green Economy commissioned by the Department of the 
Environment -- contains the first account of how in the 1980s 
Britain was living on capital rather than new income. 
  He looked at the five percent savings made nationally in the 
1980s and subtracted the depreciation of assets such as North 
Sea oil and gas reserves, the increase in pollution and the loss 
of recreational opportunities through new development. 
  He found Britain was using up capital faster than it was 
generating income from economic growth. ``What tips us into the 
red is the failure to take account of the environment,'' he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover, environment editor: ``Ministers </F>
Fight Uphill Battle on Car Fumes''] 
  [Text] A leaked draft of Britain's environmental strategy 
for the next 20 years shows that traffic growth will have a 
steadily worsening effect on the quality of life. 
  Traffic emissions are ``major challenges'' to the 
Government's attempts to reduce climate change and to improve 
air quality in cities. An increase in vehicles will damage 
nature sites and create unacceptable noise levels. 
  The draft transport chapter of the UK Strategy for 
Sustainable Development is frank about the negative effects of 
the projected doubling of traffic growth over the next 25 years. 
But it is likely to disappoint environmentalists because it 
contains no new transport policies to curb road traffic or 
promote public transport. 
  The document, drawn up as Britain's contribution to carrying 
forward the aims of the Rio Earth summit, warns that travel 
costs ``may have to rise further to reflect environmental costs 
and to affect the future demand for transport.'' But it says 
there will be public resistance to this. 
  The near-final draft of the report, to be launched by the 
Prime Minister next week, shows that Mr. MacGregor, Transport 
Secretary, and Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, disagreed over 
the need to accommodate traffic growth. 
  Amendments and deletions by Mr. MacGregor show the Transport 
Department at pains to excuse and justify its policy of building 
roads to meet demand. 
  There remain some strong statements, such as: ``It is clear 
that traffic growth in certain parts of the country, and on 
certain assumptions, would produce unacceptable economic and 
environmental consequences.'' 
  It is the lack of any conclusions which measure up to this 
striking analysis of the problems posed by traffic growth that 
is likely to invite criticism on Tuesday when the strategy -- 
which covers every area of Government from energy to agriculture 
-- is launched. 
  The strategy points out that technical innovations in 
engines, catalysts and fuels will not be enough to temper the 
increase in pollution. It says the benefits of catalytic 
converters will be short-lived as traffic growth overcomes 
initial gains in air quality. 
  It says the Government is also likely to have to take action 
to limit carcinogenic substances in petrol such as benzene. 
  It also points out that transport creates water pollution, a 
mountain of 20-30 million used tyres each year and that road 
building, even at present rates, accounts for 32 percent of the 
sand and gravel quarried. 
  The document's conclusion is a call for more public 
information, further research and for local authorities to 
develop clear environmental targets and criteria. 
  Environmentalists said the emerging evidence of what the 
environmental strategy contains showed a chance to change 
policies into the next century had been thrown away. 
  Miss Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, said: ``The 
Government has admitted that traffic growth is a massive problem 
but then they throw their hands up in the air when it comes to 
doing anything about it.''

<F P=106> [Report David Brown: ``Satellite to Track Sheep in Hunt for </F>
Radiation''] 
  [Text] Scientists have harnessed space technology in an 
attempt to rid sheep in the United Kingdom of radioactive 
contamination from the Chernobyl disaster. 
  About 500,000 sheep in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales 
are still affected by the fall out from the 1986 explosion. 
  They plan to fit transmitters to scores of animals so they 
can be tracked by satellite wherever they are on the remote 
hills and moors. Each back-pack strapped to the sheep contains 
a microcomputer, transmitter and receiver. 
  The packs not only record the sheep's exact position but 
also 
every jaw movement. Researchers can tell when the animals are 
feeding and when they are simply ruminating. The aim is to find 
the remaining ``hotspots'' of radiation. 
  More than 500 UK farms are still subject to movement 
restrictions on their flocks almost eight years after the 
explosion at the Russian plant. 
  The worst affected area is Wales where about 230,000 sheep 
on 
340 farms are affected by legislation preventing their meat from 
being sold until they have been checked by government scientists 
. 
  Many sheep, even those born long after the Chernobyl 
disaster, are still eating radiocaesium in vegetation growing on 
contaminated soil. 
  Now, after successful trials with a satellite-based Global 
Positioning System developed for the U.S. Defence Department, 
scientists at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental 
Research at Northwyke, Devon and the Institute of Terrestrial 
Ecology at Merlewood, Cumbria, are ready to tackle the 
contaminated farms.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and 
Russia have agreed to jointly investigate radioactive pollution 
of the East Sea (Sea of Japan) by the former Soviet Union and 
Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, from March 15 for 31 days, 
the Science and Technology Ministry said on Monday. 
  Delegates from the three countries signed a letter on the 
investigation in Vladivostok, Russia, on Saturday. 
  According to the plan, nuclear and marine experts from the 
three countries will leave Vladivostok aboard a 4,000 ton-class 
Russian ship, the Okean, on March 15 and conduct an 
investigation of seven points in the East Sea for 31 days. 
  The experts will examine sea water, undersea soil and marine 
life. 
  Within a month after the investigation, the experts will 
submit a preliminary report and within a year, they will issue a 
final joint report. 
  Seven experts from Korea, nine from Japan, 15 from Russia 
and 
one from the International Atomic Energy Agency will participate 
in the mission, with the costs shared by the three countries.

  [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] and environment watchdog Earthlife Africa have 
accused the government of ignoring its own ban on the 
importation of toxic waste by sanctioning further shipments of 
mercury waste to the Thor Chemicals company in Cato Ridge, Natal. 
  ANC environment spokesman Prof. Stan Sangweni also called on 
the Department of Environment to turn back a container-load of 
160 barrels of mercury waste due in Durban on Monday. The waste 
is being transported by the Safmarine vessel Agulhas from Borden 
Chemicals and Plastics in the United States. 
  Former Environment Minister Gert Kotze announced in 1990 
that 
the government had banned the importation of hazardous wastes 
into South Africa. However, the government subsequently 
sanctioned importation of ``spent chemicals'' by Thor for 
recycling on condition the wastes originated from Thor companies. 
  According to Earthlife Africa spokesman Chris Albertyn, the 
Department of National Health also sanctioned further imports of 
mercury waste from the U.S. which did not originate from Thor. 
  Prof. Sangweni said on Wednesday the government should 
explain its ``double standards'' in allowing the importation of 
hazardous waste. 
  A Department of Environment said she could not comment at 
short notice. Natal Attorney-General Tim McNally confirmed on 
Wednesday he had requested the Department of National Health to 
investigate several complaints against Thor Chemicals involving 
hazardous waste. This followed a letter to Mr. McNally by 
Earthlife detailing alleged infringements of health and safety 
regulations by Thor Chemicals. 
  Three senior executives of the chemical company face charges 
of culpable homicide following the death of employee Peter Cele 
through suspected mercury poisoning. Thor said on Wednesday the 
Borden shipment was a ``routine and unexceptional consignment.'' 
  A spokesman challenged statements that the consignment 
should 
be classified as ``toxic'' waste. The company extracted mercury 
from spent catalysts which would otherwise end up in landfill 
sites, he said.

  [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- Demonstrators picketed outside 
the Cato Ridge factory Thor Chemicals on Monday in protest 
against the importation of a shipment of toxic waste bound for 
the plant, halfway between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. It also 
emerged on Monday that public pressure had forced the company to 
stop all activities and business related to mercury. The first 
practical implementation of this decision means the import will 
be returned. 
  The shipment, which was on Monday afternoon en route to 
Durban harbour from the United States, contains more than seven 
tons of activated carbon containing five percent toxic mercuric 
chloride. 
  Weekend reports said the ship would be turned back after the 
American chemical company expressed concern about thor after 
recent events at the Natal plant. Criminal charges are pending 
after a Thor worker died of mercury poisoning. 
  In spite of protests the cargo would be landed in Durban 
because, according to carrier Safmarine, all documentation for 
the load indicated it was activated carbon and no more hazardous 
than charcoal. 
  But environmentalists Earthlife Africa, in cooperation with 
Greenpeace, trade unions and the African National Congress 
reportedly arranged with the American exporter to have the 
shipment returned. 
  Safmarine spokesman Richard Warnes said on Monday afternoon 
that regardless of reports there had been no orders to stop the 
shipment. He said Safmarine viewed the matter seriously ``but at 
this stage there is nothing we can do. It is legally 
inappropriate for us to stop the process.'' 
  The company could not open the cargo to test it because this 
might increase the environmental risk if it was toxic. Safmarine 
was committed to the environment and would not do anything to 
endanger it. He said the position might change before the ship 
docked on Tuesday. 
  Earthlife Africa activist Mandy Jackson said she and eight 
others demonstrated outside Thor Chemicals to protest against 
the company's incineration of toxic waste. 
  Thor is claimed to have accepted three imports of 7,500 kg 
of 
toxic waste, which Ms. Jackson said still had to be disposed of. 
Thor was urged to return the chemicals to sender, she said. 
  Ms. Jackson said she had heard that Thor had agreed on 
Monday 
to stop importing toxic waste after a joint tour of its plant by 
an ANC environmental mission and the Environmental Justice 
Network Forum. A Thor spokesman confirmed this, saying: ``We 
won't receive it (the new shipment) and arrangements are being 
made for it to be returned.'' In ``all probability'' there would 
not be further imports, he said. 
  ``There has been so much pressure, it takes up too much of 
our time and it means problems with the staff,'' the spokesman 
said, adding that business related to mercury constituted about 
20 percent of Thor's activities and would be discontinued.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 5 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to 
verifications by the Hong Kong Observatory: Since Guangdong's 
Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant started trial production last 
August, to date Hong Kong has found no increase in the quantity 
of radiation. The observatory also predicted that after the 
Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is officially put into operation, 
the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong per year 
will be fairly low and will not affect human health. 
  Since the end of last August, the Dayawan Nuclear Power 
Plant 
has started supplying on a trial basis some electricity needed 
in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory set up nuclear 
radiation monitoring posts in 10 areas of Hong Kong, but to date 
has found no signs of an increase in the quantity of radiation. 
Wang Mingsong, chief senior scientist at the observatory, said: 
It is predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is 
put into full operation, the increase in the quantity of 
radiation in Hong Kong will be merely under one-thousandth the 
amount of ordinary radiation exposure in urban areas; this will 
not affect human health. 
  Dai Qianjun, public affairs manager for the Hong Kong 
Nuclear 
Power Investment Corporation, noted: Hong Kong's power plants 
did not increase power generating equipment last year, but Hong 
Kong's demand for electricity is increasing. After it is put 
into operation, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant can provide 70 
percent of its electricity to Hong Kong, accounting for 17-18 
percent of the amount consumed in Hong Kong; this will meet Hong 
Kong's power demands from 1994 to 1995. Moreover, the low 
operating cost will maintain a stable electric rate in Hong Kong 
over the next 20 years.

(0719 3185): ``Pollution From Coal Burning Brings About Social 
Catastrophe; 30,000 People Live in Affected Areas''] 
  [Text] Qianxinan Autonomous Prefecture is an area that is 
rarely seen in the world in terms of frequent cases of arsenical 
poisoning caused by pollution from burning coal; the affected 
areas have a population of more than 30,000. In the areas 
affected by arsenical poisoning, the incidences of ascites due 
to cirrhosis, skin cancer, and lung cancer are very high. 
Patients suffering from chronic arsenical poisoning mainly live 
in Jiaole Village (formerly Jiaole Township), Yuzhang Town, 
Xingren County; and Dadi Village, Bayou Village, and Xiaogeduo 
Village under Xingyi City; as well as Anlong County's Haizi 
Township and Getang Town. The incidence of disease in Xingyi 
City and Xingren County has reached 17.28 percent, whereas in 
Anlong County a new affected area was discovered in the second 
half of 1993, and experts estimated that the incidence of 
disease there would surpass 17.28 percent. 
  Over the past few years, governments at various levels and 
the relevant departments have adopted measures time and again: 
Closing down some coal pits, banning coal mining in some 
districts, distributing medicine to people, and modifying their 
cooking stoves, thereby controlling arsenical poisoning to 
certain extent. However, the problem is still a very serious, 
as well as urgent one, which merits further attention from the 
authorities and various quarters of society.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Disputes over truck 
pollution and fish were dominating a European Union [EU] 
ministerial meeting here Monday [21 February] on negotiating 
terms to let four applicant countries into the EU, diplomats 
said. 
  The meeting stretched into the night as European Affairs 
ministers prepared for negotiations Tuesday [22 February] with 
counterparts from the applicant countries -- Austria, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden. 
  Monday's meeting was dominated by Austria's attempts to curb 
polluting truck traffic over the Alps, and Spain's efforts to 
extract a high price for Norway's integration into EU fisheries 
affairs. 
  ``We are not the ones doing the asking. The union is warning 
that applicants must accept EU rules,'' Belgium's European 
Affairs Minister Robert Urbain said. 
  Hanging over the meeting was a decision by Swiss voters on 
Sunday [20 February] that all truck traffic across the Swiss 
Alps must be switched to rail, for environmetal reasons. 
  Switzerland is not among the current applicants for EU 
membership, but diplomats pointed out that Austrians might 
follow the Swiss example by also taking a hardline environmental 
stand in the Austrian Alps. 
  Austria is insisting on maintaining strict limits on truck 
traffic across the Alps until 2004, seven years later than 
accepted by Brussels. 
  As a member of the EU, however, Austria would be expected to 
accept its fair share of the huge truck traffic flow across the 
EU's single market, which might be unacceptable to its voters. 
  The diplomats warned that the traffic flow across Austria 
could increase because of trucks diverted from Switzerland, 
adding fuel to the environmentalist anti-EU movement in Austria. 
  In the fish dispute, Spain was insisting at Monday's meeting 
that its fishing fleet, the biggest in the EU, be given access 
to Norway's fishing waters as part of a membership deal. 
  France and Ireland were also pushing for protection from 
cheap Norwegian fish exports. 
  And the EU countries were battling with another important 
consequence of taking Austria, Finland and Norway into the union 
-- the need to cut their high agricultural prices down to EU 
levels. 
  Prices in these countries are inflated by hefty subsidies 
needed for the survival of farmers in harsh Arctic and Alpine 
conditions. 
  The two sides are split over how to cushion the effect of 
price equalisation, and the EU's demands that the applicant 
countries should bear the full cost. 
  Adding pressure to the negotiations is a deadline of 
February 
28 for finishing them so that the applicants can join the EU by 
January 1 next year. 
  The EU's Greek presidency has pencilled in February 25-28 
for 
a final four-day negotiating bid to reach agreement before March 
1.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 5 (AFP)--China, facing sanctions for 
not cracking down on trade in endangered species, seemed to have 
won some breathing space Saturday after a top international 
wildlife protection official said some progress had been made. 
  ``We were very encouraged by what we saw,'' Murray Hosking, 
standing committee chairman of the UN Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) told AFP. 
  However, Hosking, who left here Saturday after a four-day 
visit at the head of a CITES delegation, indicated that while 
the Chinese authorities had taken important steps to counter the 
illegal trade in rhinoceros horns and tiger bones, question 
marks remained over enforcement. 
  ``The policing mechanisms they have set up are as good as 
any, but the important thing now is that they are seen to 
work,'' he said. 
  CITES launched a scathing attack on Taiwan and China in 
September for not enforcing restrictions and called on its 120 
members to consider punitive sanctions ``up to and including the 
prohibition of trade in wildlife'' against both. 
  China reponded in November by issuing a total ban on the 
trade in rhino horns and tiger bones, including their use in 
traditional Chinese medicine. 
  Although Hosking declined to give specific details of the 
delegation's findings, he described the report that he would 
take back to the CITES standing committee as ``positive.'' 
  The committee will study the report before deciding whether 
to go ahead with the sanctions threat. 
  According to Hosking, China has agreed to carry out 
nationwide inspections of pharmaceutical companies and outlets 
this year and in 1995 to ensure the trade ban is being adhered 
to. 
  ``The government must make sure that the policing is done 
visibly. Above all, it has to make it clear to the companies 
that it is serious,'' he said. 
  However, he acknowledged that the use of animal parts in 
Chinese medicine was a deeply ingrained tradition that would 
take time to break. 
  ``You cannot change the cultural traditions of 1.2 billion 
people overnight.''

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese official 
said here today that China will strengthen cooperation with 
international organizations, as well with countries where rhinos 
and tigers live, in its efforts to protect the endangered 
species from becoming extinct. 
  State Councillor Song Jian made the remarks to a visiting 
international delegation led by Murray Hosking, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 
  The CITES delegation, which arrived here this week, 
inspected 
rhino horns and tiger bones sealed at a storehouse of a Beijing 
Chinese medicine factory yesterday and flew to Zhanjiang in 
Guangdong Province this afternoon to watch the burning of rhino 
horns tomorrow. 
  ``China has lost two billion yuan since the Chinese 
Government banned the trade in rhino horns and tiger bones last 
year,'' Song said. 
  But he noted that it was necessary for the Chinese 
Government 
to take proper protection measures to save rhinos and tigers 
from becoming extinct. 
  ``This policy is not only in line with the interests of 
Chinese people but will also benefit mankind as a whole,'' he 
said. 
  ``It indicates that the Chinese Government has taken a firm 
and serious stand in implementing international conventions, and 
the international community should show its full understanding 
of it and give it the evaluation it deserves,'' he said. 
  ``China has thousands of years of history of producing 
medicines from fauna and flora, while it has been only five 
years since it enforced the law to protect wild life,'' Song 
said. 
  ``It is a gradual process in perfecting the laws and 
increasing the public's awareness of the importance of 
protecting wild life,'' he said. ``You cannot expect to achieve 
all this overnight.'' 
  Song said that he hoped that the international community 
would understand the actual difficulties China is facing in 
protecting endangered species, as well as the Chinese 
Government's determination and achievements in protecting wild 
life. 
  ``It will not help solve problems to put pressures on China 
and force China to do something which it is not able to do for 
the time being, disregarding the country's national 
conditions,'' Song said. 
  He added that China is completely open to the outside world 
in the area of environmental protection. ``We welcome 
international organizations to send people to China to offer any 
criticism of our shortcomings and improve our work by giving 
their help and support.'' 
  Murray Hosking said that his delegation had clearly seen 
that 
China has taken resolute measures to protect wild life, and the 
country's legislative work in wild life protection was 
outstanding. 
  ``We particularly appreciate China's open policy in wild 
life 
protection and the country has proved this in its policy banning 
the trade of rhino horns and tiger bones,'' he said. 
  The other members of the delegation expressed their 
appreciation of the sacrifice China's state-run medicine 
factories have made in implementing the government's policy 
banning all trade in rhino horns and tiger bones. 
  ``I urge Chinese scientists to step up their research on the 
substances of the Chinese medicines and find substitutes for 
them as soon as possible,'' said Izgrev Topkov, a member of the 
delegation.

  [Text] Fuzhou, Feb 5 (CNS)--The Fujian authorities recently 
staged a campaign cracking down on the trafficking and smuggling 
of the state-protected rare species of animals and their parts, 
including rhinoceros horn and tiger bone. People found involved 
in such activities face harsh punishment. 
  Deputy Director of the Fujian Wild Life Protection Fund Mr. 
Bao Yingsen said that the trend of trafficking and smuggling 
rare species of animals had been on the rise in recent years. 
Incomplete statistics showed that a total of 520 cases of this 
kind were investigated and dealt with in the province last year 
alone with the seizure of a large number of items related to 
rare animals under state protection, including the skins of 
giant pandas, the skin and bones of tigers, a species of 
leopard, big lizards, rare species of cats, rhesus monkeys, 
pangolins and black bears, with all the confiscated items valued 
at over RMB 10 million [renminbi]. 
  Illegal elements trafficking and smuggling rare species of 
animals for big profits mainly came from some ten provinces 
while others were Taiwan businessmen. 
  The large-scale killing and poaching of rare species of 
animals has aroused serious concern. The fund joined forces 
with departments of forestry, public security and industry and 
commerce in launching a crack-down on these illegal activities, 
staging raids and sudden inspections on guesthouse, hotels, 
restaurants and agricultural and trade markets for the illegal 
handling of rare animals. They also dealt with the seized 
traditional Chinese ready- made medicines containing rhinoceros 
horn or tiger bone available in some drugstores and 
foreign-related guesthouses. 
  The Fujian authorities investigated 84 guesthouses and 
hotels 
found illegally handling wild animals during last October alone 
with the seizure of some 700 wild animals under state protection 
and over 10,000 animals including masked civet cats and snakes, 
none of which belong to the key category of rare animals under 
state protection. A number of illegal elements were dealt with 
and punished. A criminal found guilty of profiteering by 
selling a giant panda skin was sentenced to 15 years 
imprisonment by the Dongshan County People's Court and was 
deprived of his political rights for five years.

  [Text] Zhanjiang, Feb 7 (XINHUA) -- Some 230 kilograms of 
rhino horns were set on fire today in Zhanjiang, a booming town 
of south China's Guangdong Province as part of the efforts by 
the Chinese Government to perform its international obligations 
to stamp out smuggling and poaching and protect wildlife. 
  The rhino horns were part of the 825 kilograms confiscated 
by 
the Zhanjiang municipal government from smugglers and illegal 
trading. As 595 kilograms of rhino horns were identified as 
having been seized before China joined the Convention on 
International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna 
and flora in 1980, they were exempt from being destroyed. 
  Hundreds of local residents watched the police poured 
gasoline and set the huge pile to fire under the supervision by 
representatives from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of 
Public Security, the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce and the State Office on the Control of Import and 
Export of Endangered Species. Among the audience was a 
four-member delegation from the CITES headed by its Chairman 
Murray Hosking and Secretary General Izgrev Topkov. 
  The move was hailed by the CITES delegation as a 
``courageous 
act of the Chinese Government.'' 
  ``We find this burning ceremony very much a demonstration of 
the commitment of the Chinese Government to wild life 
conservation,'' said Murray Hosking, CITES chairman. 
  ``We think it is a very important gesture,'' he said. ``It 
would help people in other countries to understand the efforts 
made in China to protect endangered wildlife.'' 
  According to the Chinese official, since the country joined 
CITES in 1980, it has stopped importing rhino horns. 
  ``Though no rhinos are found in the wild in China, the 
Chinese Government has listed it as one of the key wild animals 
for national protection, banning its sales, purchase, 
transportation and import and export,'' he said. 
  It was the second time for the Chinese Government to burn 
rhino horns in public this year. Earlier this year, 50 
kilograms of tiger bones (including fake ones) and rhino horns 
were burnt in Harbin in the country's northeastern Heilongjiang 
Province. 
  According to Chinese officials, all of the rhino horns which 
entered China before 1980 have been sealed by the government and 
will be used by Chinese scientists for experiment to find out 
substitutes for rhino horns, an important and very efficacious 
ingredient in many of the traditional Chinese medicine. 
  In the meantime, the Zhanjiang people's police has arrested 
a 
group of people headed by Lin Chengjie from the Wuchuan County 
Pharmaceutical Group Company for unsealing the rhino horns 
confiscated by the government to attempt to smuggle them out of 
the country. 
  Smugglers from overseas had colluded with Lin and bribed 
him. 
Chinese police said that it has the right to investigate 
overseas smugglers involved in the case and may demand them to 
stand witness in the court. 
  According to officials from the Ministry of Forestry, rhinos 
mainly live in economically less-developed countries and 
poaching and smuggling there were very serious. Natural 
disasters are also destroying the rhino population. 
  The number of rhinos have been reduced by 85 percent since 
the 1970's and only an estimated 10,000 are found in the world.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 4 (XINHUA) -- China will consistently 
crack down on illegal pollution and destruction of the 
environment -- this year and in years to come, a senior Chinese 
leader said today. 
  Song Jian, state councillor and director of the Environment 
Protection Committee of the State Council, made the remarks here 
today at the closing ceremony of a national conference on 
environment protection work. 
  Song said his committee will focus on inspecting how well 
the 
environment laws and regulations are observed this year. 
  ``Those who break the environmental laws and regulations, 
irrespective of their positions, will shoulder the legal 
responsibility,'' Song said. 
  Song said the government officials will not only be judged 
in 
terms of economic results but also their achievements in 
carrying out the environmental laws and improving the 
environment. 
  What he termed ``major and important cases'' of destruction 
of the environment will be fully investigated and handled 
according to law, Song said. 
  The state councillor said the environment pollution has been 
more and more severe in some areas, and disputes on environment 
pollution emerge from time to time. 
  Song said the National People's Congress and the State 
Council will jointly inspect the environment protection work in 
a dozen provinces this year. 
  Some of the polluters found will be obliged to improve 
substantially within a set time, others will be shut down, he 
said. 
  Especially rural enterprises will be further checked, he 
added, since some of them lack the money and expertise to 
control pollution, and thus bring more damage to the environment. 
  Song Jian said the role of mass organizations should also be 
brought into full play to protect the environment. 
  They should be encouraged to participate in this drive 
themselves, as well as to supervise the governmental work on 
protecting and improving the environment, he noted.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lin Minzhong (2651 3046 1813)] </F>
  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The 19th 
conference of the International Union for the Protection of 
Nature and Natural Resources closed here on 26 January after 10 
days of intensive discussions on protecting the diversification 
of living things on earth and the rational use of natural 
resources, as well as environmental protection and sustained 
developments. 
  This was another important international conference on 
global 
environmental protection after the UN-sponsored conference in 
Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to discuss environment and development. 
The theme of the conference was ``caring for the earth and its 
residents.'' The 1,300 or so representatives from 118 countries 
and regions presented and adopted over 100 motions about 
protecting the environment and promoting sustained development. 
  Unlike previous international conferences on the 
environment, 
experts attending the just-concluded meeting showed greater 
concern for conditions which people depend on for development as 
well as for the rational use of the earth's natural resources. 
They pointed out that the industrial powers' destruction and 
waste of large amounts of resources during their development 
processes must not be repeated. 
  The three-year strategy the conference has drawn up for the 
union consists primarily of urging and assisting countries to 
protect the integrity and diversification of the environment so 
as to ensure the rational use of natural resources, and 
encouraging government and nongovernment organizations to 
continue their cooperation in protecting natural resources. 
  On 25 January the conference, by a majority of votes, vetoed 
a motion sponsored by some members that vilifies the Chinese 
Government for destroying Tibet's natural environment and 
resources. Taking the floor at the conference, the Chinese 
representative condemned the motion, saying that it was a 
political motion intended to incite ``Tibet independence.'' He 
pointed out that the motion's accusation that the Chinese 
Government has ravaged Tibet's environment is ``totally 
groundless.'' [passage omitted on election of union president]

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: ``State Plans for a Green China''] </F>
  [Text] The government will implement a five-year 
environmental cleanup plan in pursuit of a ``Green China,'' the 
National Environmental Protection Work Conference was told 
yesterday. 
  Industrial waste treatment will be improved and biological 
diversity will be protected. 
  Legislation will be hurried through to oversee the 
production 
of materials which deplete the ozone layer and control the trade 
in poisonous chemicals. 
  And international environmental conventions will be 
respected 
by the plan. 
  The measures for cleaning up an ever more polluted China are 
part of a National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) 
programme which will run up to 1998. 
  The World Bank, the Asia Development Bank and global 
environmental foundations will be asked to help finance domestic 
waste control projects. 
  And legislation for the control of waste transfer across 
borders will be introduced. 
  Nature reserves will be expanded to cover 8 percent of 
China's total land area under Nepa plans to protect biological 
diversity. 
  About 80 percent of the country's industrial waste water 
will 
be treated by 1998. At the moment only about 68 percent is 
being treated. 
  And five year targets have been set for the treatment of 
industrial waste gas and solid refuse. 
  Nearly 88 percent of gas will be treated, compared to the 
current 79 percent. And 45 percent of solid waste will be 
processed by 1998, compared to 1993's figure of just under 40 
percent. 
  A pilot project to develop environment-friendly agriculture 
in 50 counties will be run by Nepa in coordination with seven 
State departments. 
  Local governments will use a carrot and stick approach to 
tighten up on the treatment of industrial pollutants. 
  Waste discharge licences will be necessary, and 
``environmental symbols'' will be awarded to pollution-free 
products. 
  The country's environment has become a lot worse over the 
last few years, especially in the mushrooming cities, according 
to the Nepa report. 
  It is hoped that implementation of the programme will 
prevent 
further environmental deterioration and lead to a clean, 
beautiful and pollution-free China. 
  Environmental pollution and ecological damage have impeded 
China's reforms and hindered its foreign relations. 
  Products and facilities that consume excessive energy or 
poison the environment will be banned. 
  Nepa will regularly update the public on the environment. 
And 10 model ecology projects will be built. 
  The central government also plans to launch a ``Green 
China'' 
programme to crack down on industrial and urban pollution. 
  China's environment has suffered from the economic boom. In 
some places, energy and raw material have been consumed with 
complete disregard for environmental damage. 
  And there is widespread ignorance of State laws and 
regulations on environmental protection. 
  Some local governments just don't have the clout to enforce 
the current safeguards, according to Nepa. 
  Nepa warned that the coming five ears are crucial for the 
country if it is to establish adequate environmental protection 
for the 21st century.

<F P=106> [By Robert J. Saiget] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Feb 17 KYODO -- China's growing coal 
consumption poses a huge threat to the environment, a leading 
Chinese official said recently, and things are bound to get 
worse as the country struggles to generate enough energy to fuel 
its booming economy. 
  ``Our biggest environmental problem is coal. You cannot deny 
that in the next 20 to 30 years coal use will continue to 
grow,'' Yang Jike, vice chairman of the environmental protection 
committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) said in an 
interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  ``We have lots of coal...To generate electricity it's the 
cheapest,'' he said. ``Coal is easy to get, you only have to 
dig.'' 
  China used between 1.1 and 1.2 billion tons of coal in 1993, 
mostly for heating and generating electricity. Industry sources 
predict China will consume as much as 1.5 to 1.6 billion tons by 
the year 2000. 
  Coal burning emits several harmful air pollutants including 
carbon dioxide (Co2), a major contributor to the global warming 
or ``greenhouse effect,'' and sulfur dioxide (So2), the main 
cause of acid rain, which destroys the nutritional value of soil 
and pollutes rivers and lakes. 
  ``As far as I'm concerned, laws are the only way to restrict 
the rapid development of the coal industry. We can also use 
laws and regulations to encourage development of renewable 
energy sources such as hydroelectric power, wind, tidal, 
geothermal power and biogas, as well as nuclear power plants,'' 
Yang said. 
  The threat of excessive dependence on coal is of such a 
serious nature that Yang sees the construction of nuclear power 
plants and the environmentally controversial Three Gorges dam -- 
set to be the world's largest -- as necessary projects to limit 
coal use in China. 
  Despite nearly universal ignorance of environmental concerns 
among the general masses, Yang stressed the Chinese Government's 
commitment to environmental protection, citing its signing of 
the UN-sponsored framework convention on climate change and the 
convention on biological diversity at the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Rio de Janeiro. 
  The 1993 establishment of the NPC Environmental Protection 
Committee places priority on environmental legislation aimed at 
controlling pollution and protecting natural resources, he said. 
  New construction projects in China now must first have an 
environmental impact statement approved, he said, while several 
draft laws will lay down standards for solid waste disposal, air 
and water pollution as well as standards for resource 
exploitation. 
  China's environmental protection is an uphill battle against 
not only the demands of rapid economic development and growing 
energy use, but subject to the tremendous pressures of a 
massive, largely uneducated agrarian population which feeds the 
nation on only 7 percent of the world's arable land. 
  Chemical fertilizers, deforestation and indiscriminate 
strip-mining are leading to rapid soil erosion, while new 
highly-productive seed varieties are diminishing genetic variety 
while increasing the susceptibility of entire crops to a number 
of destructive plant viruses. 
  Although Yang is careful to support the party's official 
policy of fast, healthy and stable economic growth, ``my own 
opinion is that we don't want to develop too fast,'' he says. 
``Ten percent growth is too fast. I hope we can control growth 
to keep it below that level, ideally in the range of 6 percent.'' 
  ``We are faced with a very critical environmental 
situation,'' Yang said. ``Our challenge is to do our best to 
overcome this serious situation,'' he said.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 24 January to 7 February. 
  GHANA 
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 2000 GMT on 24 January reports that a four-day international 
seminar on forest land use, its conflicts and solutions in Ghana 
and Africa, is under way in Kumasi. It is being organized by 
the British Council in conjunction with the Ministries of 
Environment and Land and Forestry as well as some associations. 
According to a world report on environment "17 million hectares 
of tropical forests are lost every year, while in Ghana a 
considerable amount of the country's forest is lost." This is 
due to the continued demand for new agricultural land for food 
and cash crops, the excessive logging and the high incidence of 
uncontrolable bush fire. 
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 2000 GMT on 25 January reports that the Ofinso District 
agro-forestry officer recently advised farmers there to take 
agro-forestry seriously in order to help prevent soil erosion 
and replenish its fertility. The announcer says that the 
officer, who was speaking after a training trip organized for 25 
farmers, also "advised them to control the spread of bush fires 
and to stop the illegal burning of forest." The announcer 
further says that at Cape Coast, the Central Regional forestry 
officer " called for police protection and cooperation to stop 
the illegal felling of trees by some timber contractors and 
chainsaw operators in the region." 
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 1300 GMT on 2 February reports that about 40 representatives 
of member churches of the Christian Council of Ghana have begun 
a five-day workshop in Accra to evolve strategies to tackle 
issues of development and environment. The workshop will be 
followed by another in the north, culminating in a national one 
on the role of the Churches in national development. A 
consultant to the Christian Council, who opened the workshop 
say: "The churches can play a meaning role in development if 
they have a sound economic base." The director of development 
and environment department of the Christian Council of Ghana 
say: "The time has come for the churches to pay greater 
attention to environmental degradation." 
  KENYA 
  Nairobi KNA in English at 1700 GMT on 1 February in a 
Nairobi-datelined item reports the Kenya Government will not 
implement the second phase of the Kenya Indigenous Forests 
Conservation (KIFCON) program funded by the ODA [expansion 
unknown] because three out of the 11 conditions attached to the 
renewal of the phase were unacceptable to the government. 
  Minister John Sambu for environment and natural resources 
told a press conference in his office today that the insistance 
of KIFCON that forests should be managed by private 
organizations and NGOs was contrary to stipulations of the 
Forest Act Cap. 385 and the government could not bear with it. 
  Mr. Sambu said that the government would also not accept a 
suggestion that local communities be allowed to cultivate and 
graze their livestock in the forests as the activities were 
banned by the government in 1988 as a result of misuse. 
Restating the government's policy on conservation of forests, 
the minister said the government's forest conservation 
strategies over the years had been to sensitize the local 
community's attachment to the indigenous forest among other 
policies. 
  He maintained that the government welcomed support from 
donors with acceptable conditions and left the matter of KIFCON 
with ODA to reconsider its stand. Mr. Sambu further disclosed 
that out of 50.5 million shillings owed to the government by 
forest licencees by December 1992, 29 million shillings had been 
recovered by November last year (1993), following the 
government's threat to suspend their operations. He denied that 
the government intends to write off the debts as reported in the 
local press. 
  MALI 
  Bamako Radiodiffusion-Television du Mali Radio in French at 
2000 GMT on 26 January reports that the council of ministers met 
on 26 January and adopted a bill and a draft decree ratifying 
the convention on biologic diversity signed in Rio de Janeiro on 
12 June 1992. 
  NIGERIA 
  Paris AFP in English at 1409 GMT on 1 February in a Lagos- 
datelined item reports community representatives from Nigeria's 
southern Delta State have told a government committee of their 
fears of health risks arising from oil prospection and 
production, THE GUARDIAN newspaper reported on 1 February. 
  The alarm was raised Monday by delegates from the Urhobo, 
Isekiri and Ijaw communities at a meeting with a ministerial 
team set up by General Sani Abacha's military regime to look 
into their grievances. 
  The people of Delta state, the nation's largest producer of 
oil, have become exposed to the hazards of oil exploration and 
related activities by local and foreign companies, they said. 
The delegates added that most rivers in the region have been 
shown to be polluted with mercury and lead. "There is abundant 
evidence that the disease pattern of the Urhobo population has 
changed from the traditional malaria and pneumonia to diseases 
of the respiratory tract, central nervous system as well as 
blood system", one community leader stated. 
  High temperatures associated with gas flaring have killed 
local vegetation and rendered land unproductive for crops, they 
claimed. The communities have already complained about the 
unfair distribution of oil revenues, which contribute more than 
90 percent of Nigeria's annual income, the independent newspaper 
said. 
  The government team includes Don Etiebet, Alex Ibru and 
Melford Okilo, respectively ministers of petroleum resources, 
internal affairs and commerce, who are all from oil-producing 
southern states. 
  In protest at what they consider as political 
marginalisation, environmental damage and economic strangulation 
some residents of Delta State and neighbouring Rivers State have 
stopped some oil companies from operating and destroyed schools, 
hospitals and other buildings, a spokesman for one foreign oil 
company told AFP. 
  Dakar PANA in English at 1515 GMT on 7 February in a 
Lagos-datelined item reports an international workshop on the 
environment and sustainable development opened here on 7 
February with participants urging an integrated solution to the 
global problem. 
  In a keynote address, Rasheed Saba, of Nigeria's Federal 
Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), said that poverty, debt 
burden, and other problems facing the developing countries must 
be addressed for environmental protection to be meaningful. 
"Where a people are hungry, homeless and hopeless, you do not 
expect them to protect the environment," said Saba. 
  He called for a "multi-disciplinary process on education and 
environmental awareness at all levels", capacity-building in the 
developing nations, and a "bottom-up and participatory 
approach". The environmental expert warned that sustainable 
development should not be left at the mercy of economic 
indicators. 
  He urged the industrialised north to abandon their "wasteful 
consumption pattern." According to him, "25 percent of the 
world's rich consume close to 85 percent of the resources and 
produce some 90 percent of the waste". He said that "southern 
governments and their elites are their peoples worst enemies." 
  Maurice Sheridan of the U.K.-based Foundation for 
International Environmental Law and Development, FIELD, said the 
global endorsement of the Rio Declaration and other treaties 
should be backed by concrete action. The week-long workshop is 
being sponsored by the British Council in Nigeria and the 
Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. Topics to be 
discussed include "Human Rights and the Environment", "Access to 
Environmental Justice", "Environmental Protection and the 
Transfer of Technology", and the "Role of NGO's in Achieving 
Sustainable Development". 
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 27 
January reports that the Federal Government has announced the 
appointment of Dr. Evans Aina as the director general of the 
reformed Federal Environmental Protection Agency. A statement 
on the appointment was signed by the secretary to the government 
of the Federation, Alhaji Aminu Saleh. 
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 1800 GMT on 1 
February reports that Alhaji Dabo Aliyu, administrator of Yobe 
State, has called for pedology assistance in tackling ecological 
problems. He made the appeal while receiving a team of military 
officers from the Commandant Staff College, Jaji, who were on 
study tour of the state. The administrator explained that the 
menace of environmental degradation affects the socioeconomic 
life of the people, adding that drought, desertification, and 
deforestation affect the agricultural production of the 
communities in the state. He also said that the damming 
activities in Bauchi, Kano, and Jigawa states have cost about 45 
percent of the water flow along River Yobe, adding that most of 
the lands cultivated for rice, wheat, and irrigation farming has 
been dried up. 
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT 11 
February reports that Lieutenant Colonel Muhammed Onunka, 
military administrator of Edo State, has announced guidelines 
designed to sustain the exploitation of forest resources. He 
said at a meeting with saw millers in Benin-City that 
indiscriminate exploitation of forest resources was endangering 
the world famous species of trees. He announced that It is now 
mandatory for timber contractors to replenish cleared parts of 
the forests and to pay royalties directly to affected 
communities. 
  Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English at 1030 GMT 12 February 
announces that Alhaji Malam Adamu Ciroma, minister of 
agriculture and natural resources, has inaugurated a national 
advisory council and a technical committee to oversee the 
implementation of the tropical forests action program aimed at 
addressing the problems of deforestation in the country. 
Speaking at the ceremony in Abuja, Minister Ciroma stated that 
the problem of deforestation had become more poignant with the 
absence of a plan to replenish the forests. He said that the 
council would advise the government on the program, ensure 
commitment to its implementation, and establish interministerial 
or intersectorial mechanism at field level. 
  TANZANIA 
  Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network in Swahili at 1300 GMT 
25 January reports John Malecela, the prime minister and first 
vice president, has stressed the government's stand that 
Tanzania has no agreement and will not enter into any agreement 
with any country making it a dump for toxic waste. 
  Responding to a supplementary question in Parliament, 
Malecela assured parliamentarians and citizens in general that 
the Government of Tanzania has not allowed and will not permit 
the country to be turned into a dump for such toxic waste. He 
asserted that to date there was no evidence whatsoever that such 
a situation had ever emerged in the country. Malecela said that 
if any MP or citizen could procure or had full evidence of entry 
of such waste into the country, he could present such claims to 
his office, and that it was not necessary to set up a committee 
to deal with the issue. 
  Earlier, it was alleged that a ship called (Felicia) which 
had anchored at the port of Dar es Salaam was carrying a cargo 
of toxic waste but it was subsequently proved that the ship was 
carrying explosives destined for Zambia and Mbeya in the 
southern part of the country, for use at the cement factory. 
  UGANDA 
  Dakar PANA in English at 1504 GMT on 2 February in a 
Kampala-datelined item states: "The water level in Lake 
Victoria, Africa's largest, dropped one meter in the month of 
January 1994, according to Water Development Department of the 
Ugandan Ministry of National Resources. The director of water 
development, Patrick Kahangire, attributed the drastic fall to 
prolonged droughts saying Uganda has not received enough rains 
in the last three years. He said water levels of major lakes in 
Uganda have dropped to their lowest for the last 30 years mainly 
because of insufficient rainfall. 
  Other lakes including Lake Kyoga in the middle of the 
country 
and Lake Wamala in the central region have also lost a lot of 
water over the same period. Kahangire was of the opinion that 
the current situation could be part of the meteorological cycle 
which repeats itself after a certain period characterised by 
short periods of heavy rainfall followed by years of drought 
during which lakes dry up. The manager of the wetland project, 
Paul Mafabi, recalled that Uganda experienced heavy rains in 
1923 followed by years of insufficient rains up to 1961. He 
said during that time the water levels on Uganda's lakes were 
very low until the heavy rains of 1962-63 raised the water 
levels. Since 1964, the lakes have been experiencing a downward 
trend in water levels, reaching lowest point in January, 
Kahangire said. Officials of the water development department 
and the Uganda Freshwater Research Organization (UFRO), agree 
that the presence of the water hyacinth on Ugandan lakes had 
accelerated loss of water from lakes through rapid evaporation. 
  The volume of water in the rivers flowing into some of the 
lakes had tremendously decreased and in some cases the rivers 
have dried up, they said. Kahangire said that a further fall in 
the water levels could affect Uganda's power generation at Jinja 
Dam, 80 kilometers east of Kampala, the berthing of ships and 
worsen the concentration of pollutants in the lakes. 
  Other sources said some water pumping stations in the 
country 
had started experiencing difficulties in pumping water because 
of the receding water line.

  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Approval of the latest 
Beijing development blueprint by the Chinese State Council has 
unveiled a vision of a new modern world metropolis at the end of 
the century. 
  The State Council stressed the importance of Beijing as the 
capital of the People's Republic of China and the country's 
political and cultural center. 
  The blueprint, published together with the approval by the 
municipal government last month, maps out the course of the 
building of the city into a cultural and economic center with 
first-class public utilities, infrastructure facilities and 
living environment. 
  It also calls for important government buildings and 
cultural 
institutions to be located in downtown areas, such as along the 
north-south axis of the city, Chang'an Boulevard and the second 
ring road. 
  Buildings relegated to this class include the economic and 
trade office of the State Council, the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Communications and Culture, the National Grand Theater 
and National Women's Center. 
  According to the city's layout for 1991-2010, the future 
urban construction will place emphasis on the characteristics of 
the capital, and on the adjustment of the industrial structures 
and the use of land. 
  Start-ups of new heavy industrial plants, especially big 
power- consumers and those that may cause serious water and air 
pollution, will no longer be allowed in urban districts. 
Meanwhile, the existing ones would not be expanded. 
  The total population of permanent residents in the city will 
be brought under stricter control, to a limit of 12.5 million by 
the year 2010. 
  Air, water, garbage and noise pollution will be reduced 
drastically in the coming 20 years, with the aim of making 
Beijing a pollution-free city by the year 2010. 
  The document stipulates that all environmental quality 
indices will reach the government's standard in that period. 
  The city will cut its use of coal greatly in the coming two 
decades by piping natural gas in from Shaanxi and Gansu 
Provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest 
China. 
  In addition, several hydroelectric power stations will be 
built to supply heat to most of the urban residents who still 
use coal for heating. 
  The emission of exhaust gas will be put under control to 
further reduce air pollution. 
  People in Beijing will also be drinking cleaner water, as 
major reservoirs and underground water sources will be better 
protected. The city also plans to build 16 new sewage-treatment 
plants in the next 20 years. 
  Meanwhile, more trees will be planted, and ecological zones, 
shelterbelts and parks will be built in the urban areas. By 
2010 the total green land will climb to 6,400 ha [hectares] from 
3,00 ha at present. The forest coverage will rise to 40 percent. 
  Officials say that Beijing has achieved major progress in 
environmental protection over the past few years. So far, some 
25 percent of urban sewage is treated before it is discharged 
into rivers, and the forest coverage rate in the urban areas has 
reached 30.7 percent. 
  The document also urges a quickening of the pace of the 
urban 
infrastructure modernization drive. The focus will be on the 
expansion of the city's transportation, including subways, light 
rail traffic and expressways. 
  As a city with a long history and serving as the capital of 
several dynasties, the future construction will also be 
integrated with the brilliant culture of the nation. Beijing's 
cultural relics and scenic spots will be better protected, 
according to the blueprint.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 3 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region tops all provinces and regions in the stands of timber, a 
recent survey reveals. 
  According the results obtained from satellite and land 
inspection, Tibet has more than two billion sq m [square meters] 
of timber forests, the biggest in all of China. 
  About 9.8 percent of the region, or an area of 7.17 million 
ha [hectares], is covered by trees. 
  Across its 1.2 million sq km landspace, vast tracts of 
forests spread across the east and south of the region, while in 
the west and north is broad grassland. 
  In addition, the survey shows, most of the region's timber 
storage is virgin forest. 
  The survey was conducted jointly by 180 experts from the 
Ministry of Forestry and the Forestry Department of Tibet over a 
period of half a year. 
  Experts say the survey is significant for helping the region 
work out plans to utilize its rich resources and promote its 
economy. 
  They also stressed that forests are "the lungs of the 
Earth". 
It is urgent for the local government to take measures to 
preserve the region's forests, which are important to the 
world's ecological environment, the experts noted.

  [Text] Hohhot, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- Farmers and herdsmen in 
the Ordos Plateau of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region are enjoying better environmental conditions owing to 
effective measures to protect the land from soil erosion. 
  More than 300,000 farmers and herdsmen have made contracts 
to 
fight against soil erosion on the plateau. They have made 1,360 
sq [square] km of wasteland, half of the land contracted, green 
in the past five years. So far more than 33,330 hectares of 
farmland have been reclaimed, and trees and grass now cover more 
than 670,000 hectares of plateau lands. 
  Located on the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, 
the plateau suffers from serious soil erosion. Most of the 
muddy silt which gives the Yellow River its name comes from the 
plateau. About 47,000 sq km of land still suffers from serious 
soil erosion. 
  But with effective measures taken to protect soil erosion in 
recent years, less soil is washed into the Yellow River. An 
annual amount of soil erodes into the river is now five times 
less than the amount in the 1950s. 
  Farmers and herdsmen on the plateau pay equal attention to 
both environmental improvement and economic efficiency while 
transforming the wasteland. They build up farmland, plant 
sallow thorns and apple trees in light of soil quality and are 
developing a farm and sideline products processing industry.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- A major green 
campaign aimed at transforming barren mountains into orchards 
has been launched in north Hebei Province. 
  The curtain was lifted on the campaign on last Friday [25 
February] when thousands of explosions echoed among the hills of 
the Taihang Mountains to the west of Shijiazhuang, the 
provincial capital. The blasting will make it possible to form 
fields on hill sides. 
  The vice-director of the city's forestry bureau, Liu 
Zhanzhong, said that from 25 February to 12 March, nearly a 
million blastholes of dynamite would be exploded in the 
mountains. 
  The vice-director said these blasts would pave the way for 
the reclaiming of some 13,000 ha of fields, on which 300,000 
apple trees could be planted. 
  Hebei's campaign is only part of the Chinese Government's 
plan to afforest the Taihang Mountains which run along the 
border between Shanxi and Hebei. 
  In the mountain area, poor vegetation has been causing 
serious erosion, resulting in a rugged terrain and poor water 
conservancy, which, in turn, poses a fundamental difficulty for 
the life of local people and their production efforts. 
  Listed in the "Agenda for the 21st Century" of the Chinese 
Government, the afforestation of the Taihang Mountains will be 
one of the largest environmental construction projects ever 
launched in China. 
  It is also a critical part of global efforts to improve the 
earth environment, and will be carried out as an obligation of 
the Chinese Government to the 1992 United Nations Environment 
and Development Conference. 
  In the first year of full-scale operations on this plan, the 
effort will be concentrated on the development of apple farms, 
and will feature improved management on the side of the 
government, the vice-director said. 
  Besides its effects on the environment, the vice-director 
said the green campaign would also bring about a remarkable 
economic return. 
  The government estimates that in three to five years, these 
hillside orchards will be making 600 million yuan a year for 
local farmers.

  [Text] Beijing, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- More than 130 Chinese 
specialists on water and soil conservation have been trained 
through joint efforts by China and Japan over the past three 
years. 
  The co-operative training project, jointly funded by the 
Chinese Ministry of Forestry and the Japan International 
Co-Operation Agency, started from 1990. 
  As a main contractor of the project, the Beijing Forestry 
University built ten computer and soil analysis laboratories in 
the training center, equipped with advanced instruments costing 
over 250 million yen provided by Japan. 
  The center has, ever since its founding, made great 
achievements in research fields, including forestry hydrology, 
remote sensing, soil science, water and soil conservation, and 
natural disaster prediction. 
  Also included is research into soil erosion control and 
afforestation on north China's Loess Plateau. 
  Experimental forests have been planted in north China's 
Shanxi province over the past few years. 
  Many of the specialists have now been promoted to leading 
posts in county-level water and soil conservation departments.

  [Text] Beijing, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- More than one-third of 
Beijing's landspace has been covered with trees and grass, 
officials said here today. 
  At a meeting here today, officials from the municipal 
government said that Beijing's green coverage rate has reached 
33.58 percent due to the efforts of all residents, specially the 
many outstanding afforestation workers, who were commended at 
the meeting. 
  Beijing aims to uplift its green coverage rate by one 
percent 
annually to reach 40 percent by 2000, a goal announced by Mayor 
Li Qiyan last year. 
  Last year, Beijing enlarged its urban grassland by 541 ha 
[hectares] and planted trees on some 17,000 ha of mountainous 
areas. And more trees were planted along roads and around 
villages.

  [Text] Fuzhou, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's Fujian 
Province has taken effective measures to clean up pollution 
while boosting its economy. 
  Last year saw Fujian's gross social product quadruple, 
fulfilling its goal set for the end of this century seven years 
ahead of schedule, and its industrial output value rise by 48 
percent over the previous year. 
  According to Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial 
Environmental Protection Bureau, the province removed, closed 
down or merged 83 industrial enterprises discharging heavy 
pollution last year. In addition, it spent more than 50 million 
yuan on transforming 265 projects. 
  The bureau approved the building of more than 100 projects, 
which will install pollution-control facilities and release 
little pollution upon completion. 
  To help rural industrial enterprises solve pollution 
problems, the Environmental Protection Bureau has set up the 
"Dabao Industrial Pollution Control Center" in Shishi, a boom 
town in southeast Fujian. 
  The director noted that Fujian will focus on pollution 
treatment at 89 key state enterprises and nine units discharging 
serious pollution this year, while urging overseas-funded and 
rural industrial enterprises to exert more efforts to clean up 
pollution.

  [Text] Shenyang, Mar 1 (XINHUA) -- People no longer wear 
gauze masks in winter in this once pollution-ridden capital of 
northeast China's Liaoning Province, thanks to years of hard 
work by the city's environmental departments. 
  In winter the city used to be enveloped in choking dust and 
smoke emitted from central heating systems and factories. 
  From dusk to dawn, in particular, the dust became thicker 
and 
thicker. People had to wear gauze masks when they went out, or 
black dust would pile up around their noses and mouths. 
  "In the 1970's, my whole head and face were covered with 
dust 
whenever I went out for a stroll in the morning," said an old 
resident who lives in the city's busy Taiyuan Street. 
  To eliminate contamination sources and fundamentally solve 
the problem of pollution, the city installed contamination 
monitors high above the ground. Any unit whose discharge 
exceeded the standards would be warned or fined. 
  As a result, departments in the city have been forced to 
renovate their obsolete heating systems. By the end of last 
year all the more than 3,000 old-fashioned boilers had been 
replaced. 
  Meanwhile, the city has installed modern central heating 
facilities. 
  According the city's environmental agency, now 90 central 
heating zones have been built across the city, covering over 90 
percent of heat users. 
  The old forests of chimneys have disappeared, and the 
chimneys left no longer emit black soots. 
  Last year Shenyang reduced its smoke and dust by 10,000 
tons. 
  "The present air is much clearer," said the old resident of 
Taiyuan Street, where there is only one chimney in an area of 
800,000 square meters now. "More and more people step out of 
their home to do physical exercises in the mornings these days," 
he said.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 26 (XINHUA) -- Nongovernmental 
organizations in China and Japan should make joint efforts for 
environmental undertakings, according to a signed article in 
today's "PEOPLE'S DAILY." 
  The article, authored by Sun Pinghua, former deputy 
secretary 
general of the China-Japan Friendship Association, points out 
that some Japanese non-governmental organizations have been 
enthusiastic about China's efforts at afforestation, sand 
control and improving rural living conditions. 
  China now has more than 66.7 million ha of barren hills and 
swamps waiting to be greened, and every year large areas of land 
are engulfed by sand or threatened by flood, drought, hail or 
mud-rock flows. 
  Without well-planned, long-term and consistent efforts to 
improve the environment, China's climate will be affected, as 
will the climate of China's neighbor, Japan, Sun states. 
  Since its establishment in 1984, the Green China Fund has 
been making efforts to enhance domestic afforestation and 
international cooperation. 
  Sun says he hopes that Japanese afforestation organizations 
can have more contacts with the fund so that Japanese friends 
will be able to support China's greening activities. 
  The cooperation also requires government involvement, 
according to Sun. The increased acid rain over Japan have 
catched [as received] a growing public attention. Some Japanese 
questioned if it was the result of the untreated coal burning of 
the Chinese factories. 
  "To reach the conclusion, proof based on scientific 
researches is needed," Sun noted, adding that this also calls 
for the cooperation of both sides. 
  During the past few years academic seminars have been held 
between Japanese and Chinese scholars. However, few of them 
were related to greening and environmental problems.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 26 (XINHUA) -- China plans to send a 
research team to the Arctic in a year's time, according a 
scientist in charge of the research program here today. 
  At the first seminar on Chinese scientific research in the 
Arctic, Wei Menghua, director of the research preparatory group, 
said that the team will set off in mid-February, 1995, and is 
expected to reach the North Pole in early May. 
  He said the team's priority will be global change research 
in 
the Arctic, covering fields such as meteorology, maritime 
biology, glaciology and environmental science. 
  The researchers plan to get to the Arctic area via Russia, 
Wei said, noting that nine out of 11 successful expeditions 
internationally to the North Pole since 1909 went via Canada. 
  "It does not make much sense to follow passes others opened, 
as we are an Asian country and it's the first research team from 
China to the Arctic," explained Wei. 
  To ensure success, Wei said, members of the group will 
undergo simulated training at the end of this year along the 
Heilongjiang in north China. 
  According to Wei, the North Pole is ideal for conducting 
scientific research on space, earth and atmosphere, oceans, and 
the structure of the earth, especially on global change. 
  The International Arctic Science Committee, a 
nongovernmental 
international organization, was set up in 1991 to encourage 
cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research. Fourteen 
countries have so far joined it. Wei said China is going to 
promote cooperation with these countries through its scientific 
research.

  [Text] Lanzhou, Feb 23 (XINHUA) -- Aerial seeding has 
proved a great success in bringing more forests to Northwest 
China's Gansu Province. 
  So far, 19 counties of the province have used aerial seeding 
on 64,667 hectares, and have seen trees grown on 29,300 
hectares, including 15 large stretches of forest each with an 
area of 667 hectares. 
  With vast areas of arid land and deserts, Gansu only has a 
forest cover of 3.9 percent, far from the national average of 
13.63 percent. 
  Local governments have worked out regulations and set up 
more 
than 30 permanent stations for tree management and protection 
work in areas to conduct regular aerial seeding, in a bid to 
guarantee the success of the aerial seeding. 
  Aerial seeding, which is said to be cheaper than manual 
afforestation, has not only helped grow more trees for Gansu, 
but also helped reduce soil erosion by 80 percent, said local 
officials, adding that they will grow more trees on more land by 
way of aerial seeding in the coming years.

  [Text] Lhasa, Mar 8 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's Tibet 
Autonomous Region has over the past few years stepped up its 
"green drive", to improve the stock-raising ecological 
environment. 
  By now the region has a total afforested area of some 23,450 
ha [hectares], including more than 201 ha of nurseries of young 
trees and over 2.4 million economic trees. 
  Currently, the annual afforestation area in the region has 
jumped to more than 50,000 ha from 20,000 ha in the past years, 
according to official statistics. 
  Since Tibet began its drive for economic development in the 
areas along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the biggest river in this 
region, local governments have concentrated some manpower as 
well as funds on the afforestation drive. 
  After years of hard work, a 20-km-long forest belt of some 
670 ha has been formed along the southern bank of the river. 
  Official sources said that Tibet is one of the few regions 
of 
the country which have protected the environment well and 
Tibet's good ecology is still in good condition.

  [Text] Shenyang, Mar 5 (XINHUA) -- Growing forests has 
helped prevent one of China's leading heavy industrial areas -- 
Liaoning Province in northeast China -- from suffering worsening 
pollutions. 
  Experts say that the increasing forests greatly helped 
improve the local ecological and living environment as the 
coverage rate grew from 12.9 percent to 28.7 percent during the 
past four decades. 
  A leading industrial province in China, Liaoning has one of 
the highest proportions of urban population among China's 
provinces. However, great efforts have been made to grow and 
protect the forests, whose acreage has risen from 1.87 million 
ha to 4 million ha. 
  Officials from Liaoning Afforestation Bureau said that a 
total of two million ha of forests has been growing in the 
mountain areas in the eastern part, which protects about 80 
percent the sources of water supply in the central industrial 
part of the province. 
  Major reservoirs like the Dahuofang, which supplies water 
for 
Shenyang and other leading industrial centers in the area, 
contain the lowest level of sand among China's large reservoirs 
because of the protection of forests. 
  In the western part of the province, which used to be 
plagued 
by soil erosion and sandstorms, large numbers of trees and 
shelterbelts have been planted since 1978. As a result, 
rainfall increased by 30 percent and the amount of sand borne in 
water decreased drastically. 
  In addition, the groundwater table rose in some areas by 
three to four meters. Areas around such major cities as 
Chaoyang, Jinzhou and Fuxin, which used to import a large amount 
of grain, have been turned into rich land and grain has begun to 
be exported. 
  Forests-protecting farmland in the plains also increased to 
67,000 ha. Experts say they are protecting a total of 1.33 
million ha of farmland. Experiments have proved that 
shelterbelts can reduce wind speed by 27 percent and improve the 
earth temperature by 1.7 degrees centigrade. 
  Another one million ha of forests in the coastal areas have 
also greatly reduced the damage from the sea winds, experts say.

  [Text] Wuhan, Mar 5 (XINHUA) -- China has stepped up 
efforts to recycle used and waste materials so as to stem the 
worsening resources shortage and environmental pollution. 
  According to information from the Ministry of Internal 
Trade, 
a comprehensive waste-recycling system has taken shape across 
the country, generating considerable profit. 
  In certain departments, such as metallurgy and light 
industry, more than 70 percent of waste has been reused, say 
officials in charge of waste-recycling. 
  China, the most populated country in the world, is also a 
large waste producer. 
  It is estimated that each year, China discharges at least 
800 
million tons of industrial waste, ore tailings and garbage, most 
of which can be reclaimed. 
  Getting useful materials from waste has long been placed 
high 
on the government's agenda. 
  To date, some 4,700 large waste-recycling companies and over 
120,000 collection points spread across the country have been 
established, recovering annually 35 million tons of waste 
materials, saving up to 20 billion yuan (2.3 billion U.S. 
dollars) a year. 
  The recycling rate has seen remarkable growth in big 
consumers of materials and energy. 
  In the country's major iron and steel companies in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Anshan and Tangshan, 90 percent of their effluents has 
been recycled. 
  The Chengdu Seamless Steel Tubing Mill in southwest China's 
Sichuan Province has recycled all its waste water, leaving 
virtually no harmful discharge. 
  Sixteen companies in the country have started to recycle 
coal 
gas and residues discharged from their boilers. 
  In addition, according to inspection of more than 130 firms 
in the trades of papermaking, consumer chemicals, sugar 
producing and so on, measures have been taken to reuse their 
waste. 
  The sugarcane chemical works in Jiangmen, Guangdong 
Province, 
has taken the lead in making paper from the residue of sugarcane 
while producing alcohol, yeast, aldehyde and fertilizer with 
waste generated during the process of papermaking. 
  Chinese scientists have also successfully recovered silver 
from used films. Techniques to recycle waste rubber and iron 
scrap have also been worked out.

  [Text] Kunming, Mar 4 (CNS)--Participants attending the 
second session of the 7th Yunnan People's Political Consultative 
Confrence warned that a sharp drop in arable land resulting from 
serious soil erosion would have disastrous consequences. 
  Yunnan, a highland province with arable land making up a 
mere 
7.5 percent of its entire area, has few effective water 
conservancy works while the land under cultivation is so weak 
that its productivity is far lower than the average across the 
country. Soil erosion is growing more serious because of 
frequent natural disasters such as drought, water-logging, 
flooding, earthquakes and mudslides with the living conditions 
in some areas being in jeopardy. Land under cultivation is 
still in decline as incomplete statistics show that the area of 
paddy fields wre reduced by 149,300 mu in 1993 compared with the 
area in 1985. 
  The use of land in the province is not yet under proper 
administration and some counties and cities have rushed to make 
use of arable land for the establishment of development zones 
without undertaking prior fasibility studies. The participants 
at the conference pointed out that damage to the ecological 
environment and land would result in waste and lead to a 
disastrous outcome. They called for greater awareness of the 
need for environmental protection in the province while at the 
same time asking for the drawing up of measures for the 
protection of land for proper use. 
  Director of the Yunnan Institute of Economics Mr. Hu 
Tongyuan 
suggested that a dramatic adjustment of the agricultural pattern 
should take place. Ecological-safe agriculture, 
commerce-oriented farming and agriculture for the earning of 
foreign exchange should be painstakingly undertaken. Modern 
agriculture should be developed with a wider scope covering 
farming, forestry, animal husbandy and breeding togethr with 
comprehensive exploitation of the processing industry. The area 
under cultivation needs to be maintained in order to ensure a 
certain amount of agricultural output while few breakthroughs 
could be seen as far as science and technology were concerned in 
the improvement of farming conditions while at the same time 
demands for grains for consumption continued to grow steadily.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Gao Jun: "Contest Plan to Make </F>
China Green"] 
  [Text] The government is launching an annual contest to 
reward the nation's greenest cities, counties, townships and 
villages. 
  The move is a new initiative to boost the country's 
tree-planning drive. 
  Cities will be in the running to become one of the country's 
"top ten" if at least 85 percent of the local residents have 
voluntarily planted trees, said a circular issued by the 
Forestry Ministry and the National Afforestation Committee. 
  At least 30 percent of each city must be covered with trees, 
grass and flowers. Each resident should have at least 5 square 
metres of green space. 
  In addition, every construction project must include green 
areas. 
  The judges will also consider no candidate in whose area 
there has been a serious natural or man-made forestry accident 
in the past five years, said the circular. 
  As well as the green cities, the judges will select 100 
counties and 100 townships and 1,000 villages each year, the 
circular said. 
  The winners will receive medals and certificates, but their 
titles will be revoked if their standards fall, the circular 
added. 
  The green contest aims to boost the drive to control soil 
erosion and to relieve the damage caused by storms and sand. 
  It is also designed to encourage local farmers to make more 
profits by planting trees and developing forests. 
  Forestry officials said the prize winners should also 
perform 
a leading role in improving the farmers' living standards and 
helping them escape poverty. 
  Meanwhile, China's top forestry official vowed yesterday to 
work full time to improve procedures to prevent forest fires. 
  The news came during a national telephone work conference, 
chaired in Beijing, during which it emerged that forest fires 
decreased remarkably last year, thanks to the persistent efforts 
of local governments and forestry staff. Forestry Minister Xu 
Youfang told the conference that the area of forest hit by fires 
nationwide last year tumbled 54.3 percent from 1992. 
  The number of individual fires fell by 34.7 percent, he 
said. 
  And the figures are respectively 41 and 42.3 percent lower 
than the average level of the previous five years, he added. 
  However, he went on to call for better equipment and 
training 
for the country's forest firefighters to enable them to cope 
with all emergencies. 
  Xu also stressed that regulations or fire prevention should 
be improved and more strictly enforced. 
  A professional network to prevent forest fires should be 
established to analyze and research the causes an spread of 
fires, he said. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng called on local governments 
to 
remain vigilant saying they must do all they could to avoid 
anything that might cause similar damage as suffered by other 
countries in recent forest fires.

  [Text] Kunming, Mar 4 (XINHUA) -- A group of biologists are 
helping monks plant trees and flowers in a temple in Yunnan 
Province's Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna. 
  From Chinese Academy of Sciences, the scientists are trying 
to preserve the rich plant varieties in this southwest China 
tropical region. 
  Professor Xu Zaifu, director of the prefecture's botanical 
garden, said that it is also a research conducted according to a 
United Nation's convention issued in 1992 to preserve the 
diversity of living beings and local culture and maintain the 
harmony between them. 
  Funded by the U.S. Ford Foundation, they aim to cultivate 
over 100 kinds of plants which are on the verge of extinction 
caused by the population growth. 
  The 19,000-sq-km prefecture, bordering on Myanmar [Burma] 
and 
Laos, is a home to a dozen minority nationalities, including the 
Hani, Lahu, Blang and Yi, with a combined population of over 
800,000. The Dai nationality accounts for the largest 
proportion. 
  Plants play an important role in local religion. 
  The Dai people believe in a kind of Buddhism, the sutras of 
which are written on palm leaves. 
  According to ancient records, trees always appeared in 
important events in the life of the father of Buddhism, 
Sakyamuni. He was born, enlightened and entered a state of 
nirvana under trees. 
  So trees have been honored as holy among local Buddhists. In 
the past, anyone who cut down a tree would be sentenced to death 
and their offspring made slaves. 
  In addition, temples and Buddha figures are made of valuable 
timber. Lamp-oil, perfumes and dyes are refined from flowers 
and leaves. 
  At present, there are more than 500 temples in the 
prefecture, which are called "gardens for buddhist plants", with 
at least over 50 varieties in each of them. 
  Xu and his colleagues hope to extend the research to other 
temples.

  [Text] Tokyo, Mar 4 KYODO -- An international gathering to 
discuss measures to achieve environmental conservation and 
economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in the next 
century will be held in Tokyo on 16 and 17 March, government 
officials said Friday [4 March]. 
  The meeting will be attended by experts from Asian and 
Pacific countries and the United Nations, they said. 
  At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO 
Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency 
pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of 
other Asia-Pacific nations and the UN. 
  The first meeting on the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" 
will decide on the date of release of the report while 
discussing concrete measures, the officials said. 
  Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an 
interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year 
and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in 
1997, they said. 
  The plan will propose policies, financial aid and 
international cooperation needed to maintain the environment and 
yet promote development in the region. 
  The experts will draft the program after making projections 
for the region's future population, economic growth, 
manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, demand for energy, state 
of urban areas, and environmental conservation policies, the 
officials said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jari Lindholm: "Cambodia Soon Deforested"] </F>
  [Text] The warring parties in the civil war are in a hurry 
to sell the country's natural resources. 
  Near the end of 1992, a reconnaissance plane from the UN's 
Cambodia operation filmed from the air the Pailin area, which is 
controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The film was so shocking that the 
UN declared it secret. 
  The guerrillas had raped all of western Cambodia. Hills had 
been turned into open mines, from where precious stones had been 
taken to Thailand. The remaining trees had been felled and 
dragged across the border, without any attempt to spare the 
ground vegetation. 
  In Cambodia, peace and capitalism have been able to achieve, 
in one and a half years what war and communism were unable to do 
in two decades; the country's unique natural resources are 
teetering on the brink of an ecological catastrophe. 
  The warring parties of the Cambodian civil war are the 
people 
behind the deforestation. In 1991, after peace had been reached, 
they hurried to sell the natural resources of their lands to the 
highest bidders. 
  Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia's neighbors, were the 
architects of this catastrophe. After they had put an end to 
logging in their own countries, they needed the raw material for 
their rich customer, Japan. 
  The UN development program, UNDP, is attempting to slow the 
destruction through a project that is aiding the government in 
creating a sensible environmental policy. After the UN, Finland 
is the most significant supporter of the project, as it has 
committed itself to a contribution of 340,000 dollars. 
  "Cambodia's problems are frightening," said Mbella Ngongi, 
legal counsel for the project. "Environmental protection is 
something new in this country. Even the cabinet ministers must 
be educated," he added. 
  The task appears hopeless. Starting from scratch, seven 
experts must, in less than a year, teach the Cambodians moral 
values and help them enact laws that would prevent environmental 
destruction. 
  The project's goals are awesome: the enactment of 
environmental laws in a country with only five lawyers; even 
many of the justices on the Supreme Court have no legal 
training. 
  "It's no wonder that they give up their natural resources 
without stopping to ponder the consequences of such insanity," 
said one UN official, who asked to remain anonymous. 
  In many areas, the destruction has been so reckless that 
refugees, returning after 10 years from Thailand, have been 
unable to recognize their native region. 
  During the 13-year-long civil war, the Phnom Penh 
government, 
which enjoyed the support of Vietnam, cut down forests in order 
to chase the Khmer Rouge out in the open. The guerrillas escaped 
and the timber was taken to Vietnam. 
  Logging operations accelerated in October 1991, when the 
four 
parties in the civil war signed a peace accord in Paris. 
  "In Cambodia, in a year and a half, all natural resources, 
both used and unused, ended up being controlled by foreigners," 
as the newspaper, PHNOM PENH POST, stated last summer. 
  Cambodia's neighbors need lumber. Thailand put a stop to 
logging in 1989. Laos put restraints on logging operations in 
the summer of 1991. Vietnam outlawed lumber exports in the 
spring of 1992. 
  "Cambodia was easy prey for its neighbors," said UNDP's 
lawyer, Ngong. "A civil servant earned 10 dollars a months. He 
could not believe his ears when he was offered millions just for 
tree trunks," he added. 
  In 1992, 1.5 million cubic meters was exported from 
Cambodia. 
More than half of this was transported illegally to Thailand and 
Vietnam. 
  Everyone sold logs: Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian Peoples' 
Party, which formerly led the communists, and FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia], who was loyal to King Sihanouk. 
  "We have enough forests to use," said Deputy Finance 
Minister 
Mok Mareth. "All of Cambodian is green." 
  Mareth is currently under secretary in charge of 
environmental affairs. 
  Log exports were temporarily stopped in January 1993. 
According to the UN, during the first five months of the 
moratorium, the prohibition was violated 103 times -- at a value 
of 7.2 million dollars. 
  According to Ngong, the problem is that everyone wants to 
get 
rich fast, and they are all blinded by quick profits. 
  The government parties have not stated how they intend to 
combat the ecological catastrophe. And that is not surprising, 
as soldiers from Cambodia's new army stand guard in the log 
yards of Thai companies, during forest auctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 23 KYODO -- Isuzu Motors Ltd. said 
Wednesday [23 February] it has developed an environment-friendly 
engine device for large commuter buses that automatically stops 
the engine when the bus halts at a bus stop or for a red light. 
  Isuzu said it is the first Japanese maker to develop such a 
device, called an idling-stop-and-start system. 
  The system stops the engine when the driver stops the bus 
and 
shifts the gear into neutral and frees the clutch pedal. It 
starts the engine again automatically when the driver steps on 
the clutch. 
  Isuzu said the system can reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 
nearly 10 percent when running in urban areas and improve fuel 
efficiency by about 10 percent. 
  The system will be available from April 5 for 350,000 yen, 
the company said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Mar 6 KYODO -- Japan will apply for 
exemptions from an international ban on the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) harmful to the earth's ozone layer 
despite the availability of substitutes, government sources said 
Sunday [6 March]. 
  The sources said the government has informed the 
Nairobi-based secretariat of the Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer that it will seek the exemptions 
in three areas, including coolants in refrigerated and frozen 
food display cases. 
  The exemptions, if permitted, would allow the limited use of 
CFC's beyond the late 1995 international deadline for the 
suspension of their production and use. 
  Such exemptions are permitted under the Montreal Protocol on 
substances that deplete the ozone layer. 
  The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet 
rays. 
  Given an international trend toward minimizing exemptions, 
though, the Japanese request is likely to be the main issue to 
be discussed at an autumn meeting in Nairobi of countries which 
are signatories to the protocol. 
  The Japanese list of proposed exceptions is likely to come 
under severe criticism from European countries and environmental 
conservation organizations because it includes substances for 
which substitutes have already been developed. 
  The government is arguing that the exceptions are necessary 
because Japan has many small businesses which rely on CFC's and 
industry has not made sufficient advances in the recovery of 
CFC's. 
  It is requesting that Japan be allowed 1997-98 reserves of 
about 80 tons of CFC-115 used in refrigerator display cases and 
freezers and an additional 240 tons or so of four types of CFC's 
used as jet agents for sprays in medical equipment because there 
is no suitable substitute. 
  The government is also arguing that Japan will need 
additional reserves of several substances for use as solvents 
and standard reference material for use in analysis and research 
into CFC's. 
  These include about 150 tons of carbon tetrachloride used in 
fire extinguishers, about 6 tons of CFC's, and about 3 tons of 
1,1,1- trichloroethane normally used in the production of 
insecticides. 
  All of the substances cause damage to the ozone layer. 
  Under the convention, their production and consumption is 
due 
to be suspended by the end of 1994. 
  Exceptions to the Montreal Protocol are permitted under an 
"essential use" clause, but only apply where they are necessary 
to health and safety and where a substitute is not economically 
or technologically practical. 
  The international environmental and conservationist 
organization Greenpeace says the United States has submitted 
requests for exceptions for its space shuttle program and for 
local anesthetics which far exceed Japan's requests. 
  But Greenpeace says the U.S. requests do not include 
refrigerator coolants for which substitutes have already been 
developed. 
  European Union countries have indicated they will submit 
requests for exceptions of only small amounts, while 
Switzerland, the Netherlands and Australia have all indicated 
they will reduce amounts to zero by the deadline.

  [Text] Tokyo, Mar 7 KYODO -- The Health and Welfare 
Ministry on Monday [7 March] urged the Environment Agency to ban 
the herbicide CNP (chloronitrofen), widely used on rice paddies, 
because it may cause gall bladder cancer. 
  The ministry said the acceptable daily intake of CNP set in 
1977 should be scrapped. In response to the ministry's 
decision, the Environment Agency decided not to register CNP as 
an agricultural chemical until a new acceptable daily intake has 
been agreed and urged the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry to halt its use, officials said. 
  The Health Ministry made the recommendations on the basis of 
a report from a committee advising it on the safety of residual 
agricultural chemicals. 
  The Farm Ministry also said it will order local governments 
to stop using CNP and replace it with substitutes in time for 
the April-June planting season. Ministry officials said 12,000 
tons of CNP were used last year. 
  The manufacturer of the chemical, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals 
Inc., will also voluntarily cease producing and marketing it, a 
company executive said Monday. 
  Managing Director Takeshi Nakai said the company is 
confident 
of the safety of CNP, but decided to voluntarily stop producing 
and selling it, and "abide by the government's announcement." 
  "Only a few farmers have purchased CNP at this point, so 
there should be little confusion if we ask them to return it," 
Nakai said. 
  Mitsui Toatsu produces 8,000 tons of CNP annually. It has 
already manufactured 4,000 tons this year. CNP sales amount to 
1.4 to 1.5 billion yen each year, company officials said. 
  Weed killers containing CNP are normally distributed to 
farmers via local agricultural associations. 
  The possible danger from CNP came to light after clinical 
tests by Prof. Masaharu Yamamoto of Niigata University medical 
faculty showed that the rate for gall bladder cancer among 
residents in the Niigata Plain, one of the country's main rice 
producing areas, was unusually high. 
  Civic organizations in the Niigata area have demanded that 
the government ban the chemical. 
  The Health and Welfare Ministry's advisory body concluded 
that there was a regional correlation between CNP and gall 
bladder cancer, but also said it was difficult to establish a 
causal relationship. 
  Yamamoto said there is sufficient statistical correlation 
between the use of CNP and gall bladder cancer, but any proof of 
a causal relationship will have to wait until there are signs of 
a drop in the death rate from the cancer after the ban on CNP 
takes effect.

<F P=106> ["Joint statement" issued by DPRK political parties and </F>
public organizations in Pyongyang on 3 March] 
  [Text] In connection with the fact that the random dumping 
of nuclear waste materials into the sea has recently been 
disclosed in South Korea, DPRK political parties and public 
organizations released the following joint statement: 
  Joint statement of DPRK political parties and public 
organizations: 
  The random dumping of nuclear waste materials into the sea 
has recently been disclosed in South Korea. This greatly angers 
the nation. 
  Data show nuclear power stations in South Korea dumped into 
the sea 142 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste materials 
in 1991 and 155 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste 
materials in 1992. 
  The South Korean puppets dumped 11,000 trillion becquerels, 
or approximately 100,000 curie, into the sea in the seven years 
from 1986 to 1992. This is an unimaginable, grave crime that 
artificially destroys the ecosystem and inflicts miserable 
nuclear damage on the South Korean people, in addition to fellow 
countrymen and mankind in general. 
  Generally speaking, radiation amounting to approximately 1.7 
curie has damaged the ecosystem. It is not difficult to imagine 
the horrific, devastating consequences the massive nuclear waste 
materials, amounting to 100,000 curie that the South Korean 
puppets dumped into the sea, will bring to the ecosystem and the 
frightening catastrophes it will inflict on the South Korean 
people, in addition to fellow countrymen and mankind in general. 
  As is well known, if nuclear waste materials are dumped into 
the sea, they will contaminate or kill fish, shells, laver, 
brown seaweed, and other maritime resources and, thus, inflict 
fatal damage on the existence of the maritime ecosystem and 
people. Therefore, the London Convention bans the maritime 
dumping of high-intensity [kojunwi] nuclear waste materials. It 
also stipulates that dumping of low-intensity [chojunwi] nuclear 
waste materials in maritime areas must be over 200 miles away 
from continental shores [taeryuk yonan], where fish live, and 
over 4,000 km deep, where there are no volcanic activities and 
where man will not enter even in the distant future. It also 
stipulates that dumping in those areas is prohibited without 
notifying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A decision 
was adopted in 1993 on completely banning maritime dumping of 
nuclear waste materials. 
  The South Korean puppets' random dumping of nuclear waste 
materials into the sea is an unforgivable grave crime of 
flagrantly violating international law on respecting the natural 
environment and protecting maritime resources. Because of the 
uncouth ruling bunch, which ignores the law and destroys the 
environment at random, the South Korean sea is turning into a 
sea of death where all maritime resources are on the verge of 
extinction and the ecosystem and the people's existence are 
gravely threatened. 
  Because of the puppet clique's reckless dumping of nuclear 
waste materials in the South Korean sea, many sorts of fish have 
disappeared, fish are killed en masse, and seaweeds are dying. 
Moreover, in South Korea, women who ate fish contaminated by 
nuclear waste materials have given birth to premature or 
deformed babies, numerous people suffer from cancer and other 
incurable diseases and unidentified diseases, and fishermen's 
lives have become difficult because people will not buy 
contaminated fish. 
This is none other than a crime of devastating the land where 
our fellow countrymen live and threatening the existence of our 
fellow countrymen. 
  Our country is called a 3,000-ri land of beautiful mountains 
and rivers because water is clear and because the scenery is 
beautiful, and it is all the better to live in because the land 
is fertile and because maritime resources are abundant for the 
land is surrounded by the sea on three sides. How can Korean 
[Choson] people who have a national spirit tolerate this utterly 
unforgivable crime of turning such land into a land contaminated 
by nuclear waste materials where man cannot live and how can 
people of the world who have conscience turn a blind eye to 
[panggwan] this crime? 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and all other political parties 
and public organizations on the northern half of the Republic 
sternly denounce the Kim Yong-sam ring's dumping of nuclear 
waste materials in the name of all fellow countrymen, describing 
such dumping as an antinational crime of severing the lifeline 
of the South Korean people and all fellow countrymen in general 
and of turning our country into a barren land [pulmojidae] 
contaminated by nuclear materials and as a flagrant violation of 
the international law and convention on protecting the natural 
environment and banning the dumping of radioactive waste 
materials. 
  The South Korean puppets' dumping of nuclear waste materials 
is unthinkable apart from the secret maneuvers to develop 
nuclear weapons in South Korea. The South Korean puppets' 
maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons which started in the early 
seventies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella have reached a very 
grave stage today. 
  The puppets raise our nonexistent nuclear issue and 
viciously 
conduct an anti-Republic smear campaign. One of the reasons for 
this is to divert attention at home and abroad to the North and 
accelerate their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. Traitor 
[yokto] Kim Yong-sam himself told a news conference on the first 
anniversary of his inauguration a few days ago that the North 
has no nuclear weapons. In this way, he himself admitted that 
their anti- North nuclear commotions were a false smear campaign 
to harm their fellow countrymen and hide the truth of their 
nuclear development. 
  Even while pursuing nuclear development, the Kim Yong-sam 
ring babbles about even military countermeasures [kunsajok 
taeung] against someone else. Because it is so mean and 
shameless, the Kim Yong-sam ring unhesitatingly dumps nuclear 
waste materials, an antinational act against humanity [pan illyu 
chogin]. 
  Even after running amok in toadyism, treachery, fascism, 
anti- North confrontation, and divisionist maneuvers, traitor 
Kim Yong-sam even kicks up maneuvers to dump nuclear waste 
materials. If traitor Kim Yong-sam is left intact, no one can 
expect independence and democracy in South Korean society or 
peace in the country and its peaceful reunification, and our 
fellow countrymen will not be able to escape from the danger of 
nuclear disasters [haekchenan]. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch must immediately disclose its 
past dumping of nuclear waste materials and apologize to all 
fellow countrymen. If the South Korean authorities continue 
dumping nuclear waste materials and secretly pursue nuclear 
development, they will not be able to escape from the stern 
judgment of all fellow countrymen and history. 
  It is the South Korean people who will suffer the greatest 
damage from the nuclear waste materials that have flowed into 
the South Korean sea and who will be sacrificed first. The 
South Korean people must wage a popular struggle against the 
puppet ruling bunch's dumping of nuclear waste materials and 
develop this struggle into an anti-U.S. and antigovernment 
struggle by closely linking it to the antiwar and antinuclear 
struggle. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to dump nuclear 
waste materials are a crime against humanity [panillyujogin 
pomjoe haengwi], which harms not only our fellow countrymen but 
also countries in our vicinity and various regions in Asia and 
the world. On this opportunity, we expect that political parties 
and organizations of various countries of the world, 
international organizations, and people of all countries that 
love peace and aspire for social justice and progress will pay 
due attention to the South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to 
dump nuclear waste materials, raise their voices against such 
maneuvers, and take appropriate measures to stop them.

  [Text] Seoul, Mar 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
sent an application to United Nations Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali Monday to join the Basel Convention, which 
controls trans-boundary movements and disposal of hazardous 
waste. 
  South Korea will be regulated by the Convention from 29 May, 
90 days after it sent the application, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Under the Convention, signatories cannot trade waste matters 
with nonparticipants. If they want to export waste, they should 
receive written approval first from the country which imports 
the waste. 
  The Basel Convention specifies the kinds of waste matters to 
be controlled, and sets procedure of trans-boundary movements of 
the waste and ways to make a final disposal of the wastes in 
order to protect human health and environment. 
  As of now, 52 countries joined the Convention.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb 25 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will soon seek 
National Assembly ratification of the UN Convention on the Law 
of the Sea and membership in a pact for biological diversity, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Friday. 
  "More than 60 developing nations have ratified the 
convention 
on the Law of the Sea, and the United States and other advanced 
nations have said they, too, will participate. A convention 
will be launched encompassing all countries in the near future," 
Han said in his report to the National Assembly Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and Reunification. 
  "The government will seek assembly ratification and 
preparatory work on relevant domestic laws," he said. 
  The pact on biological diversity went into effect last year 
but South Korea is yet to sign it. 
  Seoul plans to join the pact within the first half of this 
year, the foreign minister said.

  [Text] This morning in Vientiane capital, Khamphoui 
Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister and chairman of the 
Committee for Planning and Cooperation, received a courtesy call 
from Victor Khlystun, minister of agriculture and foodstuffs of 
the Russian Federation and chairman of the Russian-Lao 
Governmental Committee on Economic, Trade, Scientific, and 
Technical Cooperation, and his entourage. 
  The deputy prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic hailed the visit by the Russian delegation, noting that 
it serves to further promote and strengthen the long-standing 
solidarity, friendship, and cooperation between Laos and Russia. 
  Earlier on the evening of 1 March at Lan Xang hotel in 
Vientiane capital, a ceremony was held to sign a memorandum 
between the Lao and Russian Governmental Commissions on the 
Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation and a 
cooperation agreement between the Lao National Council of Trade 
and Industry and the Russian Council of Trade and Industry. 
Signing the documents on the expansion of Lao-Russian 
cooperation on investment for the Lao side were Sompadit 
Volasan, minister of trade and chairman of the Lao commission; 
and Sisouk Sisombat, chairman of the Lao National Council of 
Trade and Industry. Signing for the Russian side were Victor 
Khlystun, minister of agriculture and foodstuffs and chairman of 
the Russian commission; and (Genedy Roskoskov), trade 
representative of the Russian Federation to Laos. According to 
the two documents, the two sides have agreed to render immediate 
assistance to organizations concerned to set up a joint 
Lao-Russian business venture on the basis of the laws of each 
country. The Russian side expressed their readiness to study 
proposals to ensure the normal operations of all business 
enterprises and projects set up during the period of technical 
assistance provided by the former Soviet Union. As for 
scientific and technical cooperation, the Lao side reaffirmed 
its readiness to set up scientific and technical cooperation 
with Russia on the basis of the utilization of its own natural 
resources, technical lessons from Russian, and funds from third 
countries, the IMF, and interested businessmen. The fundamental 
task of this cooperation program is the protection of the 
environment, the conservation and restoration of forests, the 
raising of the level of harvest efficiency, the eradication of 
crop pests, and mining and exploration.

  [Text] Wellington, Feb 25 (AFP) -- New Zealand will export 
its remaining 350 tonnes of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) to France for destruction, the Foreign and Health 
Ministries said in a statement Friday. 
  New Zealand has no facility capable of destroying PCBs, 
which 
were used in electrical equipment. 
  The PCBs are to be incinerated by French state-owned company 
Tredi at a site near Lyon, which is expected to receive the PCBs 
from New Zealand. 
  The environmental organisation Greenpeace said it will 
continue its campaign to stop toxic waste shipments. 
  Spokeswoman Stephanie Mills said the shipments to France 
broke the spirit of the Basel Convention on waste trade, which 
called on countries to deal with wastes themselves.

  [Text] Activists from Greenpeace -- an international 
ecological group -- have prevented a Russian container ship 
loaded with toxic and hazardous materials from entering the port 
of Manila. Two 40-foot container vans, each containing 22 tons 
of dangerous computer scraps [preceding two words in English] 
from Australia, were discovered inside the Russian ship Gamzat 
Tsadasa. A Greenpeace patrol group was able to follow the ship 
all the way from its port of origin in Australia. 
  According to Greenpeace, these computer scraps [preceding 
two 
words in English] can cause health problems, specifically 
respiratory ailments. The computer scraps [preceding two words 
in English] are mixed with asbestos and other toxic materials. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0728 GMT on 2 March in a 
similar 
report adds: "A Philippine senator and the environmental 
activist group Greenpeace protested the delivery of two 
containers Wednesday allegedly carrying Australian `computer 
scrap' to be dumped in this country. However, the Russian ship 
that brought the containers resisted calls to take back the 
shipment, which Greenpeace claimed included hazardous materials 
like asbestos and harmful plastics, back to Australia.] 
  ["Senator Orlando Mercado, a vocal advocate of environmental 
measures, accompanied by journalists, located the two containers 
at Manila's port and ordered them loaded back on the ship 
`Gamzat Tsadasa.' Cranes were used to bring the containers 
alongside the ship but crew members told Mercado that their 
captain refused to take them on. Mercado was later joined by 
local environmentalists and members of Greenpeace who visited 
the Philippines on the last leg of a Southeast Asian tour to 
protest developed nations' dumping of hazardous waste in 
developing countries. They hoisted a huge banner over the two 
containers, saying `Australia, stop wasting Asia.' Greenpeace 
members said very little of the computer scrap could be 
recycled, saying the rest would be dumped. They added that this 
violated a Philippine law banning the shipping of toxic 
materials to this country.] 
  ["Leigh Sarinas, terminal manager of Filipino-Soviet 
Shipping 
Company, a Philippine-Russian joint venture that owns the ship, 
confirmed its docking at Manila before dawn Wednesday had been 
delayed by Greenpeace attempts to intercept the ship. 
Greenpeace said the shipment had been 'impounded' but Customs 
officials could not confirm this."]

  [Text] Taipei, Mar 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs (MOEA) formed a strategic industrial alliance with a 
Danish environmental technology firm Thursday [3 March]. 
  Under the pact, both sides will cooperate on environmental 
protection technology to produce high value-added products. 
  Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who signed the pact 
with Voluno Ecology Systems Chairman S. Costa in Taipei, said 
the deal is the 12th of its kind since the MOEA embarked on the 
mission to form strategic alliances with foreign enterprises. 
  The Voluno group is a world-renowned multinational 
enterprise 
which has been an environmental technology leader for more than 
60 years. The Danish firm has built 170 incinerators in 18 
countries, including the United States, Japan, and Germany. 
  Yang said at the signing ceremony that Voluno will set up 
Asia-Pacific business and manufacturing centers in Taiwan and 
establish long-term cooperative ties with local companies and 
investment consortia. 
  He also stressed that through the alliance, Taiwan will be 
able to upgrade its industrial design and production ability as 
well as boost research and development. 
  Yang said Voluno's willingness to enter into the venture 
reflects its confidence in Taiwan's potential to become a 
Asia-Pacific business hub. 
  The Voluno pact brought the number of foreign enterprises 
which have signed strategic alliances with Taiwan to twelve. 
Strategic alliances have been signed with AT&amp;T, GE, General 
Motors, Motorola, HMM [expansion unknown], Westinghouse, and 
Carpenter Technology Corp. of the United States, Holland's 
Philips, ABB [expansion unknown] of Sweden, CSR [expansion 
unknown] of Australia, and Cida-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland.

  [Text] Taipei, Mar 1 (CNA) -- A seven-member delegation of 
U.S. wildlife conservation officials will arrive in Taiwan 
Tuesday [2 March] evening to inspect conservation efforts here. 
  The delegation, led by Kenneth Stansell, director of the 
Office of Management Authority of the Fish and Wildlife Service 
under the Department of the Interior will visit the Council of 
Agriculture (COA), the Department of Health, the Ministry of 
Justice, the Directorate General of Customs, and the National 
Police Administration during their five-day stay in Taiwan. 
  The inspection tour will help determine whether the U.S. 
Government will impose trade sanctions against Taiwan for 
alleged trade in endangered species parts. 
  COA Chairman Sun Ming-hsien pledged that the council will do 
its best to act on advice and guidance from the U.S. delegation 
or other conservation groups at home and abroad in order to 
improve Taiwan's protection of endangered wildlife. 
  He added that he will also seek a rhino horn identifying 
agreement with the United States when meeting with the 
delegation. 
  "We will take this opportunity to communicate with the 
delegation members in the hopes that a rhino horn identifying 
technique agreement with the United States will be signed as 
soon as possible," Sun added. 
  The U.S. Government's willingness to enter into such a pact 
demonstrates its goodwill toward Taiwan's wildlife conservation 
efforts, he noted. 
  The U.S. Department of the Interior, under pressure from 
international conservation groups, last September identified 
Taiwan as an area trading in rhino horn and tiger bone and asked 
President Bill Clinton to call for trade retaliation against the 
island. 
  Meanwhile, the Geneva-based Convention on International 
Trade 
in Endangered Species (CITES) Standing Committee will meet March 
21-25 to decide whether to call for an international economic 
boycott against Taiwan. 
  Two CITES delegations visited Taiwan in November and January 
respectively to evaluate Taiwan's wildlife protection measures. 
  Results of the CITES meeting are expected to be influential 
in the U.S. Government's decision in late April, Sun said.

  [Text] The head of the atomic energy authority issued a 
press release yesterday urging the public not to be alarmed over 
recent cases involving radioactive material. 
  Suchat Mongkhonphan, secretary-general of the Office of 
Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), said the quantities and types of 
uranium involved meant they were not dangerous to public health. 
  But the release also suggests that the eight barrels of 
hazardous waste imported last year by a Thai company may have 
contained small quantities of the uranium isotope -- Uranium-235 
-- considered most dangerous. 
  It was revealed last week that Thai Tantalum Co. Ltd. had 
imported from the United States nearly 3,000 kgs of toxic sludge 
contaminated by radioactivity. Officials from the Department of 
Industrial Works later announced that the company's import 
licence would be revoked. 
  Last June, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had sent a 
letter to Suchat's office via the Thai Embassy in Washington 
warning that the waste contained radioactive substances. But 
the OAEP has not been able to locate any records acknowledging 
the letter's receipt. 
  Thai Tantalum claimed that tests run on the sludge showed 
with a 90 percent certainty that it contains less than 0.2 
percent (or roughly 5.5 kgs) of thorium and uranium, two highly 
radioactive substances. 
  "The company has donated the sludge to the OAEP and we now 
have it in possession," Suchat announced. 
  "There is uranium contamination, but very little in quantity 
and most of it is Uranium-238. 
  "The level of radioactivity is not considered dangerous for 
anyone. Its concentration is below the standard set by the 
Atomic Energy for Peace Act of 1960." 
  The press release did not mention the exact amount of 
radioactive material in the sludge. According to an amendment 
to the law, those importing material containing 15 percent or 
more of uranium or thorium must obtain a licence from the Atomic 
Energy Commission. 
  The press release explained that 99.28 percent of uranium 
found in nature is Uranium-238. Uranium-235, which makes up 
only 0.71 percent of the isotopes found naturally, is the type 
that is used in nuclear reactors and to make bombs. The other 
uranium isotope found in nature is Uranium-234, it said. 
  It had not previously been known that isotopes other than 
Uranium-238 were present in the sludge. 
  "The office will use the material for research," the report 
explained. 
  Suchat also asserted that the uranium boxes reportedly being 
smuggled into Thailand from Cambodia are not dangerous. 
  "From our experience -- we have come across this kind of box 
twice before -- we have found they contain depleted uranium 
[Uranium-238] and have very low radioactivity," Suchat 
maintained. 
  He also explained that when Uranium-235 (or enriched 
uranium) 
is extracted for use from natural uranium, the remainder is 
called depleted uranium. It is considered very cheap, he said.

  [Text] Thousands of teak and other valuable trees were 
found to have been cut around their trunks and left to wither in 
an area of over 1,500 rai in the Tha Song Yang National Forest 
Reserve along the Thai-Burmese border, Forestry Department 
deputy chief Yanyong Thanomphichai said yesterday. 
  Mr. Yanyong yesterday led an eight-member committee in 
charge 
of examining the encroachment of forest reserves to check the 
Tha Song Yang Forest Reserve. 
  The committee included representatives of the National 
Environment Board, Kasetsat University, Third Army Region, 
Forest Industry Organisation (FIO) and Forestry Department. 
  The trees were cut around their trunks and left to die over 
ten years ago by Karen tribesmen who fled fighting inside Burma 
across the Moei River to Thailand, Mr. Yanyong said. 
  He added that the committee had agreed to propose that the 
FIO be assigned to fell the dead trees. Mr. Yanyong added that 
the FIO must carry out the assignment by itself, and that 
granting a private firm a sub-contract would be prohibited. 
  After the dead trees were taken away, new trees would be 
planted in the area to revive the watershed. 
  If nothing was done to the dead trees they would soon decay 
or burn down, he said. 
  Forestry Department sources said that several thousand rai 
of 
forest area in Mae Ramat National Forest Reserve in Tak Province 
had been encroached upon similarly. 
  Encroachers hired Karen tribesmen to chop around tree 
trunks, 
make a bonfire at the tree bases and build fences around land 
plots to claim ownership after the forest was declared 
deteriorated, the sources said. 
  Government officials were believed to have been involved in 
the encroachment. 
  Tha Song Yang district police chief inspector Pol Lt-Col 
Anan 
Saengthong said the encroachment was still being investigated.
