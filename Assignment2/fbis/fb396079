  [Text] The National Environment committee yesterday 
approved the Pasak Dam project, saying the environmental impact 
would be small compared with the benefits it would bring. 
  "The committee has analyzed every aspect, both negative 
impacts and advantages, and concluded that it should go ahead," 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, chairman of the committee, said. 
  The Pasak Dam project was initiated by His Majesty the King 
in 1989, but was shelved following public resistance. The 
project was resurrected in December when the King said in his 
birthday address that he wished to see the dam completed in time 
for his 72nd birthday in 1999. 
  The Irrigation Department has said it will take four years 
to 
build the dam, to be located at tambon Nong Bua, in Lop Buri's 
Phatthana Nikhom district. 
  The total cost of the project is estimated at Bt [baht] l4 
billion, with the dam itself costing about Bt4 billion. When 
complete, it will hold 785 million cubic metres of water. 
  Chuan said 70 percent of the allocated budget will be used 
for land expropriation, and compensation. He dismissed 
speculation that unscrupulous businessmen might try to cream off 
some of the money. "We have repeatedly emphasized that the 
benefits will go to the villagers," he insisted. 
  He said that conservationists need not to be worried about 
the negative effects on the environment, since the relevant 
government agencies would concern themselves with forestation. 
  Science, Environment and Technology Minister Phisan 
Munlasatsathon said that the ministry is prepared to resettle 
people and animals from the site. Villagers would be relocated 
to five reserved deteriorating forests. 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that 
government 
would spend Bt9.9 billion to help in the resettlement programme 
and to find measures to cushion the environment impact. 
  About 120,000 rai of farmland and an estimated 17,663 rai of 
deteriorating forest will be flooded by the dam lake.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 17 Feb. 
  ARGENTINA 
  The Argentine Wildlife Foundation reported that 
approximately 
265 native flora species are being threatened by extinction 
because of the "inappropriate use of resources and the natural 
areas that are being exploited." Most of the threatened species 
are in Misiones, Chaco, and Pampa Provinces. The ecosystem is 
being affected by the cutting of precious wood, the substitution 
of natural forests with exotic crops, floods, expansion of 
agricultural borders, construction of huge hydroelectric plants, 
deforestation, desertification, and burnings, among others. 
(Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 6 Feb 94 p 10) 
  BOLIVIA 
  The chimneys of the Vinto smelting plant in Oruro have 
spewed 
32,000 kg of arsenic and 312,000 kg of lead, causing 
irreversible damage to the local population. (La Paz HOY in 
Spanish 5 Feb 94 Economic Section p 1) 
  The Coordinating Board for Solidarity with Indigenous People 
issued a report on the rapid deforestation of the country's 
tropical forests by saw mills and settlers. The report charges 
that 30 or more trucks loaded with precious wood are circulating 
daily on the roads linking Rurrenabaque-Yucumo-La Paz, and 
Covendo-Sapecho-La Paz. It says that as a result of the 
indiscriminate deforestation "50 species are extinguished daily 
and forever." It adds that if current legal or illegal 
deforestation continues, the tropical forests will be extinct in 
40 years and cause major environmental problems. (La Paz LA 
RAZON in Spanish 8 Feb 94 Economic Section p 4) 
  BRAZIL 
  The Environment Ministry reported that 71 species of animals 
are threatened by extinction in the Amazon as a result of 
forestry, fires, animal skin smuggling, and river pollution. The 
ministry added that if no measures are taken, 35 percent of the 
animal species in the Amazon will be extinct in the next 50 
years. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 GMT 11 
Feb 94) 
  Ten years after the construction of the Comandante Ferraz 
Antarctic base on King George Island, Brazilian research 
activities have not been fully consolidated. The Brazilian 
Antarctic Program as well as scientific investigations in Brazil 
face the same difficulties: the delay in supplying funds, 
bureaucracy, small disagreements among groups, the lack of 
ongoing action, and fishing vessels. Meteorologist Rubens 
Junqueira Villela says that despite the difficulties Brazil 
"already has carried out a valuable task in the region, 
including geological research on oil reserves in Elefante 
Island, and atmospheric and biological research, among others." 
(Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 13 Feb 94 pp D1-3) 
  About 250 residents from Cubatao, Sao Paulo State, who have 
been exposed to toxic waste dumped there until 1984, are at risk 
since they still are exposed to highly toxic products like 
benzine hexachloride and sodium pentachlorophenate. They have 
been monitored by physicians, who were greatly concerned by 
laboratory tests that showed that 60 residents who were examined 
are contaminated with benzine hexachloride and may develop 
cancer, immunity problems, liver conditions, or problems in the 
nervous system. (Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in 
Portuguese 2200 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  Mercury from power energy converters deactivated at the 
Federal Railway Network in Barra do Pirai may have contaminated 
the Paraiba do Sul River two days ago. Fifteen-year-old Julio 
Cesar Santiago Fernandes left the product 50 meters off the 
river bank, where at least 1 kg was reportedly spilled into the 
river by some youths. At least 800 people in the Cantao 
neighborhood might be contaminated by mercury. (Rio de Janeiro O 
GLOBO in Portuguese 17 Feb 94 p 16) 
  CHILE 
  The National Committee for the Preservation of Wildlife 
claimed that the recently approved environmental law does not 
have appropriate institutional support and hinders court action 
aimed at identifying those responsible for environmental damage. 
(Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 3 Feb 
94) 
  The Chilean Air Force President Frei Antarctic Base has 
become the coordinating center in charge of preventing 
environmental disasters, especially oil spills in Antarctica. 
The Chilean Marine and the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz bases 
will cooperate in the task. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1458 GMT 13 
Feb 94) 
  URUGUAY 
  Carrasco Councilman Alberto Sanchez said serious pollution 
detected in the Carrasco stream is affecting more than 200,000 
people in the area. Approximately 60 industrial plants are 
dumping their waste in the stream. According to a study by the 
Humanities and Science College, the level of contamination is 
100,000 times higher than that permitted by the WHO. (Montevideo 
LA MANANA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 13)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 3 February. 
  BRAZIL 
  The Brazilian Senate has approved the Biodiversity 
Convention 
and the Climate Change Convention, which were signed by the 
Brazilian Government during the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 29 
Jan 94 p A13) 
  CHILE 
  The Forestry Action Plan for Chile was presented to 
President 
Patricio Aylwin on 11 January. The plan, which was drafted by 
the Food and Agriculture Organization and financed by the 
Netherlands' Government, tries to strike a balance between 
conservation and exploitation of native forests through joint 
action by the government and private companies. The plan 
provides for the implementation of several programs, including a 
program on forestry development in rural areas, one for small- 
and medium-size logging companies, and a third to strengthen and 
enhance national parks. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in 
Spanish 2200 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  According to studies, 40 percent of the soil in the Fourth 
Region, Coquimbo, in Chile is suffering from desertification. 
The study was carried out by the Committee for the Defense of 
Flora and Fauna. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p C8) 
  PERU 
  The appearance of poppy in Peru is causing irreparable 
environmental damage to the jungle because drug trafficking 
organizations are cutting trees and using chemicals 
indiscriminately. The trees are then burned, releasing toxic 
gases. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p A7)

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The United States is one of the 
countries that renders more financial assistance to Bolivia, 
although part of this assistance is conditioned to results 
obtained by Bolivia in its fight against drug trafficking. 
Bolivia and the United States share bilateral interests such as 
sustainable development and environmental preservation, which 
were discussed by the two nations' vice presidents in Washington 
in December. 
  [Begin Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
recording] We have conveyed our invitation to Vice 
President Al Gore. I hope that in the near future we can have 
the honor of receiving the visit of such a distinguished 
personality in Bolivia. [end recording] 
  Cardenas, however, will not have to wait for Gore too long. 
On 20 March, he will visit Bolivia. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] We want to have 
sustainable development that will respect and preserve the 
environment. Vice President Gore sympathizes very much with this 
yearning. [end recording] 
  During Gore's visit, U.S. support for overall growth 
objectives, which resulted in the establishment in Bolivia of 
the Sustainable Development Ministry, also will be discussed.

<F P=106> [Article by Deborah Berlinck] </F>
  [Text] Geneva -- Shrimp fishermen in Northeastern Brazil 
will have to change their fishing nets. The problem is not 
quality, but the fact that U.S. scientists believe these nets 
kill turtles. The United States has a solution: a law banning 
the importation of shrimp from countries that use this type of 
nets. If this law is implemented against Brazil, fishermen in 
the northeast will loose $30 million per year. 
  This situation makes one wonder who establishes the trade 
rules and international environmental patterns. This question 
prompted environment ministers from 25 countries to meet on 17 
February at the United Nations to discuss a basic issue: How to 
harmonize the freeing of world trade with the preservation of 
the environment. The meeting, which was headed by Brazilian 
Environment and Legal Amazon Region Minister Rubens Ricupero, 
failed to provide an answer. 
  The developing countries reached at least two clear 
decisions: They will not accept the preservation of the 
environment as a pretext for new barriers on exports of poor 
countries. Any decision in this direction must be taken at 
multilateral forum to avoid, for example, a country like the 
United States unilaterally deciding what sort of net is best for 
fishing shrimps in Brazil. 
  In this specific case, Ricupero maintains that the 
fishermen, 
afraid of being unable sell their catch to the U.S. market, are 
prepared to pay up to $10,000 for the TED [expansion unknown] 
type of net (which has a device to free turtles) and thus 
increase the cost of their catch. Fishermen in southern Brazil, 
who do not export to the United States, see no reason for 
change. The minister disclosed that a recent survey in the 
northeastern region revealed that during 4,000 hours of fishing, 
only two turtles were caught by the nets currently used in 
Brazil. 
  Widespread complaints that rich countries are using trade as 
a tool to impose their environmental patterns prompted the 
ministers to discuss another issue: In the event of a conflict 
like that of the northeastern shrimps, who will decide if the 
U.S. argument is right or wrong? Currently nobody has that 
authority, not even the UN environment agencies, not even the 
GATT. 
  Brazil and several other countries agree that the UN 
Environment Protection Program should arbitrate: Faced with a 
commercial conflict within the GATT involving an environmental 
aspect, the organization would give a decisive scientific 
opinion.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, Baja California Sur, 28 Feb -- The Chamber 
of Deputies and the Senate, through a special committee, will 
soon present to the Foreign Relations Secretariat a legal 
proposal to renegotiate with the United States the International 
Treaty on Limits and Waters [Tratado Internacional de Limites y 
Aguas] signed by the two countries in 1944, because the 
neighboring country has flooded the soil of Mexicali and Tijuana 
with saltpetrous water and infected it with agrochemical and 
fecal residues, thus rendering all that territory uncultivable. 
  A total of 30,000 hectares have been affected, and this 
caused not only huge losses to wheat crops but also to human 
life (from 1979 to 1992) due to the emergence of new and 
fulminating diseases such as acute meningoencephalitis, which 
attacks the brain directly and kills in less than 72 hours. 
  Legislators of all parties met here today with jurists, 
researchers, and specialists on this issue to discuss the 
problem and determine the terms and juridical recourses that 
could be used to renegotiate and renew this treaty with which 
the United States has failed to comply for the past 20 years. 
  In 1993 alone Mexico received from tributaries of the 
Colorado River in the United States 10 million cubic meters of 
mud in which large concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and 
calcium were detected. They "have ruined the productivity of 
the land and have irreversibly contaminated human life, flora, 
fauna, and aquatic life." Moreover, as was already mentioned, 
also detected in those waters were the free-living protozoan 
amoebas [protosoario amiba de vida libre], which reproduce when 
in contact with organic matters, such as feces, and cause 
diseases such as the aforementioned acute meningoencephalitis 
which affects people swimming in such waters. This problem 
worsened last year when the Colorado River overflowed into the 
Mexicali Valley. This nearly flooded the city. As a result, 
the Permanent Committee of the Chamber of Deputies instructed 
the Border Affairs Committee to verify the scope of the damage 
and determine whether the overflowing of the Colorado River 
violated the treaty in question. 
  A special subcommittee chaired by Deputy Javier Cital 
Camacho 
conducted the respective study and concluded that "the 
provisions contained in the International Treaty on Limits and 
Waters signed by Mexico and the United States are inadmissible 
and unfair to our country." 
  The document was also signed by Ernesto Enciso Clark and 
Rafael Morgan of the National Action Party [PAN]; Marta 
Maldonado of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Jorge 
Tovar Montanez of the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]; Rogelio 
Appel Chacon, Oscar Garzon, and Luis Moreno Bustamante of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party; and Javier Colorado Pulido of 
the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution. In this document 
they concluded that there is no compatibility between the 
hydraulic systems of the two countries, and thus, the flow 
[desfogue] of solid matters that ends up at the Morelos Dam 
"provokes permanent storage and contamination of our waterways 
[vasos]." This is "highly and dangerously harmful to the 
Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys." 
For these reasons they proposed renegotiating the treaty to turn 
it into a document that "promotes the principles of good 
neighborliness, international respect, fair treatment, and good 
intentions." They also pointed out that a new treaty should 
include the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, Sonora, and the Gulf 
of California Mar de Cortes. They said that the United States 
must expand its ability to retain solid matters at water bodies 
above the Gila River and promote the construction of reservoir 
systems and regulators to prevent the flow of mud, among other 
things. 
  These proposals were revealed today during a forum to 
analyze 
the treaty. It was headed by Governor Guillermo Mercado Romero 
and Agustin Basave Benitez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies 
Border Affairs Committee. Also present at the forum were Jose 
Ramirez Roman, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Health 
Committee; PAN members Tomas Esparza Carlos, Ernesto Encizo, and 
Rafael Morgan; PRD member Marta Maldonado; PPS member Jorge 
Escobar; and specialists Rodolfo Moreno Dahma, Maria Valdes, 
Luis Flores Lui, Manuel Ortega, and Jesus Roman Galleros. 
  The latter, who is a researcher at the School of the 
Northern 
Border and in charge of the Environmental Studies Department, 
said that this issue is extremely delicate and requires an 
urgent solution because concentrations of salt of two kg per 
cubic meter of water coming from the United States have been 
detected. This, he added, is without taking into account the 
organic residues and mud coming from the other side of the 
border. "Water coming from the United States is completely 
contaminated, and this is so because the dam system along the 
Colorado River is the most controlled system in the world." It 
contains 2,500 km of water flow controlled by 39 dams that at 
the lower end release into Mexico a heavy load of contaminants 
from agroindustrial residues. 
  In a speech Agustin Basave warned that this string of 
problems with the United States threatens to deteriorate our 
bilateral relationship. He added that in this case a definitive 
or "lasting" [de largo aliento] solution must be sought, because 
it is no longer advisable to postpone discussion or a possible 
renegotiation of this issue. 
  [Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish on 3 March carries a 
600-word article on page 4 stating that: "Following more than 11 
hours of negotiations, the Chamber of Deputies Border Affairs 
Committee has decided to propose to the government of the 
republic a 'review' of Act 242 on limits and waters signed with 
the United States instead of proposing a 'renegotiation' of the 
entire treaty, because the latter would create more conflicts 
between the two nations." Committee Chairman Agustin Basave 
points out that this issue will be brought up at the upcoming 
Mexico-U.S. binational meeting in April at the Port of Huatulco, 
because this problem 'is increasing tension in the relations' 
between the two countries.] 
  For these reasons they proposed renegotiating the treaty to 
turn it into a document that "promotes the principles of good 
neighborliness, international respect, fair treatment, and good 
intentions." They also pointed out that a new treaty should 
include the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, Sonora, and the Gulf 
of California Mar de Cortes. They said that the United States 
must expand its ability to retain solid matters at water bodies 
above the Gila River and promote the construction of reservoir 
systems and regulators to prevent the flow of mud, among other 
things.

  [Text] Off the Malabar coast, Jan 21--The Indian maritime 
zone has become highly suspectible to ecological and 
environmental degradation with the increase in the movement of 
oil tankers often resulting in oil spills. 
  About 2,000 super tankers carry oil from overseas sources to 
India with an average of 18 tankers entering and leaving the 
country's ports daily. 
  Besides this, the entire oil cargo from Gulf to the Fareast, 
Australia and Japan passes through India's Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) as it lies astride one of the major oil tanker routes 
of the world. 
  The responsibility of combating the potential threat of an 
off-shore environment disaster lies with the Indian Coastal 
Guards which patrol the country 7,000 km coastline in the 
eastern and western seaboards. 
  The Coast Guard undertook five oil spill combat operations 
during the past one year alone and one of its officers told that 
visiting media persons that "the force has earned recently 
acclaim for its successful operation in the Andaman sea by 
tackling the fire and a 40,000 zone spill. 
  The Coast Guard officials claimed that they had also 
contained the 6,000 tonne oil spill at Bombay high recently 
which was caused by the burst of a pipeline. 
  Coast Guard Director General, Vice Admiral K.K. Kohli, said 
that because of the successful anti-spill operations, the 
Government had designated his force as the "central 
co-ordinating authority" for combating the maritime spill around 
the country. 
  The Coast Guard has destroyer skimmers and chemical 
dispersants like Helo TC-3 to tackle oil slicks in the sea. 
  For containing oil spills, boats are lowered from off-shore 
patrol vessels. These boats put up oil booms which are 
inflatable tubes used in the containment of oil. The bombs also 
limit the movement of the oil and facilitate recovery. 
  As the Coast Guard demonstrated the operation, destroyer 
skimmers swung into action. This equipment is used to suck oil 
from oil water interface. Thus the recovered oil is sent to the 
refinery for re-processing. 
  In another operation, oil-absorbing plastic garline like 
rope 
is used top mop up the oil and recover it. When oil cannot be 
recovered by this process, it can be chemically dispersed by 
aerial spray by Helo TCS, fixed wing dornier aircraft and 
surface ship, using spill spray.

  [Text] Bombay, Jan 30--The problem of aging of nuclear 
reactors with the attendant radiation hazards poses a serious 
challenge to nuclear scientists the world over with 400 of them 
operational now. 
  According to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre director A.N. 
Prasad, aging could create two problems, namely, reduction in 
plant availability and--more importantly--safety. According to 
estimates 160 to 170 plants of different designs would have 
reached a service life of 25 years or more by the turn of the 
century. About 60 of them would be more than 30 years old. In 
addition, a very large number of research reactors would have to 
be decommissioned, having reached the end of their service life 
by that time. Most of these reactors were built when safety 
standards were still being evolved and regulatory requirements 
were much less stringent than now besides, the standards were 
set with the available data on performance statistics of the 
systems in relation to environmental factors. 
  Mr. Prasad said operating experience of nearly 6,000 reactor 
years gained by the world nuclear community indicated that aging 
affected all plant systems, support systems, components and 
structures in varying degrees and heightened the risk to public 
health and safety unless controlled. 
  Mr. Prasad said the problem of aging and related issues came 
into focus in the first ever international symposium of the 
international atomic energy agency in Vienna in 1987. Since then 
work in the field had been intensive as well as extensive. 
Studies led to identification of degradation of mechanisms such 
as corrosion, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking, 
fatigues, wear due to flow-induced vibrations and embrittlement 
due to aging. Various laboratories had undertaken detailed 
studies of factors contributing to such degradation. 
  In nuclear facilities other than power plants, such as heavy 
water plants, fuel fabrication plants, spent fuel reprocessing 
plants and high level waste vitrification plants, though the 
problem of aging was no less important, concerted efforts were 
not as intense. However, safety requirements in these facilities 
varied considerably. For instance, there was no serious risk of 
spread of radioactivity from heavy water plants or uranium fuel 
fabrication plants. 
  While reprocessing and vitrification plants carried a large 
inventory of fissile materials and highly radioactive fission 
products, the operations involved relatively passive and slow 
systems. They do not experience high pressures and temperatures 
like power reactors, but their equipment operate under harsh and 
ambient conditions, particularly in the presence of highly 
corrosive chemicals and high radiation fields. However, their 
number was too small to generate adequate experience in the 
field. 
  Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited managing director 
S.K. Chatterjee says the enormous cost of adding new capacity 
and lack of clearance for new sites for atomic stations had 
forced planners to consider extending operation of existing 
plants. This should be an important element in any nation's 
strategy to meet its growing power needs. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said the prestigious Tarapur Atomic Power 
Station (TAPS), which completes 25 years in April, has not run 
its normal full course of design life and was now being readied 
to operate for 40 full-power years. However, studies indicated 
that there was ample margin in ductility of pressure vessels for 
operation up to 40 full-power years. 
  In the light of stoppage of fuel supply from abroad and the 
embargo on supply of critical spares. TAPS was proposed to be 
run with indigenous Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) being developed along 
with enriched uranium. Apart from in-house development of 
spares, Indian industries were also being tapped for spares. 
While the Electronic Corporation of India has developed neutron 
detectors, the department of atomic energy has developed 
feedwater spargers of modified design and this has been 
fabricated by the industry. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said in order to tackle the problem of aging, 
components were categorised as critical or otherwise depending 
upon their potential to cause spread of radiation within and 
outside the plant if they failed. New techniques were being 
evolved to inspect components, particularly those with 
accessibility problems and high radiation environment. New 
plants were proposed to be designed to enable easy replacement 
of such components. In the case of reactor vessels which undergo 
neutron bombardment, measures such as their situ annealing were 
being initiated to improve their ductility. 
  Other measures contemplated included reducing the number of 
assemblies needed for the core. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said the carbon steel and shields of 
Rajasthan 
Atomic Power Station-I (RAPS-I) and Madras Atomic Power 
Station-I (MAPS-I) were also likely to face the problem of 
enbrittlement. However, switchover to coolant channels of 
zirc-niobium alloy and stainless steel windshields had reduced 
chances of the problem arising in MAPS-2 and Kaiga in Karnataka. 
  In the case of spent fuel reprocessing plants, aging led to 
steady deterioration of solvent extraction columns due to 
displacement of nozzle plates. There was also fouling and 
choking of the process piping due to insoluble generated. 
Besides, there was opaqueness of radiation shielding windows 
vital for remote operation and maintenance due to deterioration 
of oil, gaskets and plants by radiation. 
  The experience gained in the operation of the first plant at 
Trombay to separate plutonium in the spent fuel discharged by 
cirus. The research reactor gave insight to Indian scientists 
into a number of problems of great significance to long-term 
operations of such plants.

  [Text] When it comes to telling the West where it gets off, 
India's Kamal Nath can hit between the eyes. So can United 
States. Even though national observations may be giving the 
issue low billing, diplomats say the next battle between the 
North and the South will revolve around linkages between 
environment and trade. 
  The next GATT round which will be flagged off when Uruguay 
Round deal is signed in April is already being termed the `green 
round'. Since India and Brazii are standard-bearers of the 
South's concerns, both countries can be expected to be on a 
collision course with the West, led by the United States. 
  Two questions need immediate attention -- How does the South 
convert its concerns into a negotiating strategy in GATT ? How 
much store can countries place in GATT's professed claim to 
multilateralism when the United States maintains all its 
unilateral options to strike trade partners thus violating 
everything GATT stands for? 
  At a recent consultation on environment and trade in Geneva, 
Kamal Nath said that developing countries were apprehensive of 
the nexus between trade and environment and feared that the 
latter would be used as a protectionist instrument by high-cost 
economies against exports from the developing world. The North 
received social and environmental subsidies from the South which 
made the former's developments patterns unsustainable, he stated. 
  "It makes a mockery of free trade and if we have to set 
things right then the subsidy has to be recognised and accounted 
for," he said adding that what the debate needed was more 
science and less scare. 
  Brazilian Minister for Environment Rubens Ricupero said that 
countries need to "strengthen a multilateral approach of 
building a consensus rather that resort to unilateral measures 
that could be used under the guise of environment protection." 
There were over a 150 international agreements that could guide 
the world on how to deal with trade and environment issues, he 
stated. 
  India and Brazil have formidable and rich foes, beginning 
with Washington. Timothy Wirth from the office of U.S. Secretary 
of State has fired the first salvo. Reports say he told U.S. 
Congress that his country would use trade measures to support 
its environment objectives, listing the following tour as 
primary tasks: 
  -- Trade measures required by an international environmental 
agreement to which the United States is a party and assuring 
non-discriminatory treatment of those nations that are not party 
to it; 
  -- When the environmental effect of an activity is partially 
within U.S. jurisdiction and there is reasonable scientific 
basis for U.S. concern; 
  -- When a plant or animal species is endangered or 
threatened 
or where a particular practice is likely to cause a species to 
become endangered or threatened assuming there was reasonable 
scientific basis for U.S. concern; and, 
  -- Where the effectiveness of a scientifically-based 
international environment or conservation standard is being 
diminished, provided the standard was specific enough to judge 
that it was being diminished and could be made objectively. 
  In other words, what Washington wants is what India calls 
'economically driven regulation packed in green paper', an 
insidious way to keep competition from developing countries at 
bay. "One way of doing this is to specify standards for either 
manufactured items or worse still the processes by which the 
items are manufactured, which developing countries do not have 
the capacity to meet," Nath said. 
  For instance, some eco-labelling schemes in western 
countries 
give value only to environmentally friendly chemical dyes and 
ignore natural dyes completely, even though they are equally if 
not more ecologically sound. "Thus, Asian countries which are 
major manufacturers, and exporters of textiles cannot earn 
`Ecolabels' which should rightfully be theirs," he said. 
  What India wants is that guidelines should recognise 
national 
environmental and economic policies of developing countries and 
that certification procedures should be based on internationally 
approved criteria that would outline guidelines for such 
certification. 
  That would leave the formulation of specific standards, 
testing and monitoring of the application of procedures to local 
standardisation bodies. 
  What the West wants is a free run for its multinationals, 
propelled by their limited environmental concerns. 
  The problem is not just the West as Kamal Nath laments, 
"nobody in India takes these issues seriously." Remember the 
Uruguay Round ?

  [Text] India and Brazil have decided to step up cooperation 
in the fields of sustainable development and environmental 
conservation. In a joint statement at Agra last evening, both 
the countries agreed to continue consultations on the working of 
the Commission on Sustainable Development and implementation of 
the framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention on 
Biological Diversity, forestry, trade and environment, financial 
resources, and transfer of environmentally sound technology are 
the other areas in which consultations will continue. 
  The joint statement released at the end of the five-day 
discussions between the minister of environment and forests, Mr. 
Kamal Nath, and his Brazilian counterpart, Ambassador Ricupero, 
also speaks of bilateral exchange of scientists, scholars, 
technicians, and environmental management experts. Both the 
sides have also decided to cooperate in forest management, 
including plantation. The statement adds both sides shall 
jointly seek involvement of multilateral institutions to support 
bilateral projects as well as joint cooperation with other 
developing countries in the fields of environment and 
sustainable development.

  [Text] No unilateral trade action should be taken by any 
country in the name of environment. This was the consensus 
arrived at during the two-day international conference of 
environment ministers. At a joint press conference in Agra, 
they advocated expanding trade in such a way that it would 
reduce poverty in areas where it exists and at the same time 
address environmental concerns. They said the implementation of 
the forest principles adopted at Rio should be given special 
attention. The ministers recommended that a special task force 
be set up in all countries for the sustainable development of 
forests. The ministers also expressed the hope that the 
differences of opinion on restructuring and replenishment of the 
global environment facility should be quickly resolved. 
Environment ministers from 10 countries including Brazil, 
China, Malaysia, Germany, and Britain attended the conference 
along with representatives of leading environmental agencies.

<F P=106> [Answer to reader's question from Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy </F>
chief of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Protection of 
the Environment and Natural Resources Main Administration for 
Ecological Safety, under the "Question-Answer. We Inform, We 
Advise, We Consult" rubric: "`Spots' on Map"] 
  [Text] Your newspaper has repeatedly written about 
radioactive contamination of Russian oblasts. Can they not be 
listed? (D. Chvilev, city of Vidnoye, Moscow Oblast). 
  Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Ministry for the Protection of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Main Administration for Ecological Safety, replies: 
  "They are Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kaluga, Kursk, 
Lipetsk, Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Ryazan, 
Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Tula, Ulyanovsk, and Chelyabinsk 
Oblasts and the Republic of Mordovia. Eighteen territories in 
all. But it must be said that the danger to people's health 
compared with other sources of risk (smoking, for example) is 
not high here. In the main the level of contamination does not 
exceed 1 curie per square km. Certain parts of Bryansk Oblast 
(310 square km) with contamination of over 40 curies per square 
km are an exception. A total of 17 percent of this oblast's 
territory is contaminated. The most contaminated territory is 
in Tula (39.7 percent), Orel (37 percent), Ryazan (13 percent), 
and Kaluga (11.7 percent) Oblasts, but the contamination there 
is not great (mainly between 1 and 5 curies per square km). 
Admittedly, in Tula, Kaluga, and Orel Oblasts there are `spots' 
where contamination is between 5 and 15 curies per square km."

  [Text] That is right. Now in Maritime Kray submarines that 
have served out their useful life will be dispatched for eternal 
storage not to the bottom of the sea, but into the rocky soil of 
the Far East. The kray is short of electric power, to the tune 
of 400 mwt/hr; where to get the needed capacities? At the same 
time, 27 nuclear reactors are idle at decommissioned Pacific 
Fleet submarines; they can still produce electricity but are no 
longer transportable, plus they cannot be put to sea on 
rusted-through old vessels. 
  On the other hand, to simply mount used reactors at existing 
AES [nuclear power stations] means making oneself a subject of 
justified criticism of the "greens" and add worries to local 
population. It has been decided that if these reactors are to 
serve for the good of the national economy, it is only from 
underground. It has not been decided yet where the underground 
AES will be placed: in old mines or specially built tunnels.

  [Text] Department `Tiger'--this will be the name of a 
new unit in the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection 
Committee, formed by order of the Russian Federation. 
  The department will have special groups for combating 
poaching, which, together with internal affairs and procuracy 
organs, will track all violations involving rare and endangered 
species of animals and plants. Together with customs and border 
control, they will also have the task of intercepting all 
attempts to smuggle rare animals out of the country. 
  This measure was necessitated by growing poaching in the Far 
East, the object of which, unfortunately, are rare and 
endangered animals and plants: Amur tiger, white-chested bear, 
East-Siberian leopard, as well as rare birds and reptiles. They 
are smuggled abroad--to China and Korea. For instance, according 
to estimates of ministry for protection of environment and 
natural resources specialists, over the past two years about 150 
tigers have been killed in the Far East forests--and that 
keeping in mind that at the end of 1980's the total population 
of this species was about 350. 
  International organizations also are joining in the fight to 
save the Amur tiger.

  [Text] A Norwegian ecological organization, (?Bellona), has 
published a report entitled "Sources of Radioactive 
Contamination in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts". Here with 
the details is Dmitriy Kiselev, our correspondent in Helsinki: 
  Kiselev: The report's authors, Norwegian 
researchers (?Niels Denner) and (?Thomas Nielsen), claim they 
have obtained access to classified information, as a result of 
which they found out that over two-thirds of nuclear submarines 
are to be dismantled at the Severodvinsk wharfs near 
Arkhangelsk. Incidentally, only two nuclear submarines with 
four reactors have been dismantled and cut to pieces so far. 
The report from the Norwegian ecological organization 
(?Bellona) contains a detailed analysis of the plans to prepare 
the Severomorsk wharfs for the work to come. These include 
building new dry docks and facilities for removal of fuel 
elements, extending mooring lines for old nuclear submarines 
and, finally, modernizing the railway connecting Severomorsk and 
Arkhangelsk with the Mayak enterprise in the Urals, to which the 
highly radioactive waste is expected to be shipped for 
reprocessing. 
  However, Norwegian researchers claim that not one plan for 
the refurbishment of the wharfs for such a large-scale and 
dangerous task as destroying some 150 nuclear submarines has 
been approved. And this is in spite of the fact that the works 
were planned for the period between 1993 and 1998. Moreover, it 
is still hard to establish who is specifically accountable for 
complying with international agreements under the START-2 
treaty, and also who is ecologically accountable for possible 
consequences. 
  Meanwhile, at present many old nuclear submarines no longer 
on combat duty are dispersed throughout the fjords of the Kola 
peninsula on so-called temporary mooring, the report authors 
claim. 
  Slackness in project drafting, however, is only half the 
trouble. It has still not been decided with any degree of 
certainty what is to happen to the reactors to be removed from 
the submarines--whether they will be dumped in the Kara Sea--as 
the USSR used to do until 1991--or stored in a special 
depository in Arkhangelsk Oblast. There is no money for the 
depository, the Norwegian researchers conclude, quoting official 
and unofficial replies from those they had talked to in 
Arkhangelsk and Severomorsk. This means, the authors of the 
(?Bellona) report conclude, Russia intends to dump several 
hundred more nuclear reactors in the Kara Sea. (?Niels Denner) 
and (?Thomas Nielsen) believe that Moscow's refusal to sign the 
London convention banning the dumping of radioactive waste in 
the open sea is further evidence of the existence of these 
ominous plans. 
  What causes the biggest threat, however, in the view of the 
Norwegians, is the social unreliability of Russia's nuclear 
complex. According to their data, the staff of the Murmansk 
nuclear fleet, the Severodvinsk wharfs, and the Northern Fleet 
have had their wage payments delayed for several months. It is 
natural that, under these conditions, the people's attitudes 
toward their duties may change and the probability of a human 
error in dealing with radioactive materials increases 
significantly. 
  So, now you know about the alarming report that was 
published 
in Scandinavia. It is hardly appropriate for a new Russia to 
find out about itself from its scared neighbors.

<F P=106> [Andrey Aderekhin report: "Thousands of Tonnes of </F>
Radioactive Waste To Be Buried at Site on Iodine Plant's 
Territory"] 
  [Text] Last August IZVESTIYA reported that the chief medic 
at the Krasnodar Kray Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for 
Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision] Center had submitted a 
decree on halting production at the Troitskiy Iodine Plant as of 
25 August 1993. This deadline was subsequently put back to 10 
October that same year. The plant continues to operate and to 
add to the gigantic mounds of radioactive waste.... 
  Since after the collapse of the USSR the plant was left as 
the only one of its kind in Russia, they are thinking about 
expanding production. 
  Three years ago, having learned of the situation at the 
plant, specialists from Gossanepidnadzor and environmental 
protection departments were dispatched there. They were 
horrified by the picture that emerged -- with natural background 
radiation of 15-18 microroentgen per hour, in some parts 
workplaces were "polluted" to the level of up to 500-700 
microroentgen per hour, and radiation from the thousands of 
tonnes of actual waste reached 1500 microroentgen per hour -- 
and the defenders of people's health and the environment sounded 
the alarm. 
  Certain measures were taken immediately. Decontamination 
procedures were carried out at workplaces and on parts of the 
plant territory, showers were installed, and constant 
radiological monitoring was set up. But all this failed to 
attack the root problems. So in the end the chief medic at the 
Kray Gossanepidnadzor Center submitted a decree on closing the 
plant down.... 
  We stood with Vitaliy Tereshchenko, the enterprise's chief 
engineer and expert physicist from the Kray Gossanepidnadzor 
Center Department of Radiological Hygiene, at the edge of the 
compound where the plant has started to store sacks full of 
waste -- for dispatch to Rostov-Na-Donu, to "Radon," the nearest 
specialist combine. Some 4,000 sacks have already been filled 
here, but the work has been "in vain" -- "Radon" has refused to 
accept even a portion of the waste. 
  Further into the compound the waste has been neatly placed 
in 
sacks, while nearer to us it has just been dumped willy-nilly. 
Screw nozzles, on which a white salt containing radioactive 
substances is visible, are like snakes "guarding" the 
approaches. V. Tereshchenko moves an instrument toward the 
"snakes." It's really bad -- over 800 microroentgen per hour. 
The sand a couple of meters from the compound is also very 
"dirty" -- 575 microroentgen per hour. 
  Nearby there is a kind of lake into which water is dumped 
after the production cycle. At the bottom are thousands of 
tonnes of radioactive sediment. 
  Some of the water leaks onto the flats. The radiometric 
device indicates that the water packs a "punch" of 70 
microroentgen per hour. 
  "We have already drawn up several options for setting up 
controlled waste burial sites on the territory of the plant 
itself," Oleg Anisimov, deputy chief project engineer of the 
Russian Federation Atomic Energy Ministry All-Russia Planning 
and Design Research and Technological Association, says. 
  As it turns out, setting up a burial site on the plant's 
territory would take around two years and cost roughly 1 billion 
rubles. The buried waste will remain radioactive for 
approximately 1.5 million years. So would we not thereby be 
planting a kind of "ecological time bomb"? 
  Plant Director Valeriy Kaygorodov claims that workers at the 
enterprise have not suffered any particular illness in all these 
years. However, when the conversation turn to the fact that 
even world science has made little study of the effects on the 
human body not of huge but of low doses of radiation, they fall 
silent and appeal to other experts, saying: We are merely 
technicians.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Oleg Zlobin: "`Tsunami' over </F>
Volga"] 
  [Text] Saratov -- For the first time the readiness of the 
Volga city's inhabitants for actions in emergency situations and 
natural disasters has been checked by a comprehensive commission 
consisting of specialists of various ministries, including the 
Ministry of Civil Defense. Such checks will be held in the very 
near future in a further nine regions. Basically where nuclear 
electric power stations are in operation. 
  The conclusions of experts who spent two weeks making a 
detailed study of the situation are not reassuring. Over 500 
violations were revealed in the oblast. The establishments 
which present a serious danger include the Saratov hydroelectric 
power station [GES] across which highways and railroads run. 
Recently numerous freight trains have been accumulating and 
standing idle for a long time in front of the giant dam. 
  The manmade seas -- the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs -- 
also contain an inexorable threat. Their banks are being eroded 
so rapidly that in a year or two water could descend on the 
highways, telegraph lines, and oil bases created here. The oil 
pipeline laid in the thirties has also become a time bomb in the 
Volga region capital. 
  The Moscow experts also took a look at the underground gas 
storage station, the largest in Europe, at the Balakovo nculear 
electric power station, the "Nitron" and "Khimvolokno" 
production associations, and many other potentially dangerous 
establishments of which there are over 150 in Saratov Oblast. 
  In connection with the change in the form of ownership, at 
many of these enterprises there has been a collapse of the 
engineering services which used to keep track of manufacturing 
discipline and were in charge of civil defense questions. 
  The tendency toward an increase in accidents has been 
growing 
in recent years. Last year over 1,200 emergency situations were 
recorded in Russia. And we ourselves prepared most of the 
tragedies. According to Anatoliy Tkachev, chief of the 
inspectorate of the Russian Federation Ministry for Civil 
Defense, Emergency Situations, and the Elimination of the 
Consequences of Natural Disasters, the main reasons for all 
accidents are disregard for the requirements of industrial and 
ecological safety, extreme wear and tear on equipment, and 
insufficient strictness on the party of leaders and supervisory 
services. 
  The life and peace of any large city is a hair's breadth 
away 
from disaster day and night. That is why a law on the 
protection of the population is essential in Russia today. And 
the absence of such a law can also without exaggeration be 
called the main emergency on a Russian scale.

  [Text] According to information received by the Norwegian 
environmental organization Bellona, Russia is centralizing the 
scrapping of its nuclear submarines in the area of Archangel. 
The organization says that it has received a Russian report 
according to which nuclear submarines to be scrapped from the 
Russian Pacific Fleet are also being brought to a submarine 
shipyard near Archangel. According to Bellona's information, 
this concerns 150 submarines which have a total of 278 nuclear 
reactors. The Norwegian environmental organization assumes that 
Russia will continue dumping reactors into the Kara Sea in the 
summer. According to Bellona, this is indicated by the fact, 
among other things, that Russia did not sign the London treaty 
banning the dumping of nuclear substances into the sea, which 
became valid at the beginning of last week. Bellona today 
published in Murmansk its extensive research report on 
radio-active emissions in the Kola area.

  [Text] More than 60 million Russian citizens live in 
conditions permanently in excess of the maximum permissible 
concentrations of toxic substances in the atmosphere. Every 
year enterprises discharge more than 30 million tonnes, and 
motor vehicle transport 20 million tonnes of these substances 
into the atmosphere. There are 400 kg to every inhabitant of 
the country. 
  One-half of our population drinks dirty water. Around 28 
cubic km of dirty water are discharged into reservoirs every 
year. 
  Participants in the first scientific and practical 
conference 
on "Problems of the Rehabilitation of the Population in Zones of 
Ecological Violations," which concluded in Moscow yesterday, 
spoke about all this with alarm. It was organized by the 
International Fund for Socioecological Aid and a number of trade 
union, state, and other organizations in the framework of 
preparation for the All-Russia Day of Defense Against Ecological 
Danger. The assembly discussed draft normative documents on 
ecological state of emergency and ecological disaster zones and 
the compensations procedure for damage to the health and 
property of citizens caused by pollution of the environment. 
  The conference appealed to the Russian president and the 
organs of legislative and executive power to adopt urgent 
measures to fulfill the Russian Federation Law "On Protection of 
the Natural Environment," drawing attention to the fact that 
ecological policy should become a component of economic and 
social transformations.

<F P=106> [SPASENIYE "Own Information" under the rubric "Officially </F>
Speaking": "On the President's Desk"] 
  [Text] As we have learned from reliable sources, waiting 
for the signature of the president of the Russian Federation is 
the draft edict "On State Strategy of the Russian Federation for 
Protection of the Environment and Provision of Stable 
Development," prepared by specialists of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Finance, with the participation of other 
interested ministries and departments and the State-Legal 
Administration of the president of the Russian Federation. The 
draft was drawn up in execution of the government plan of action 
for 1993-1994 for implementation of the first stage of the 
program "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian 
Economy." 
  The draft was developed in order to organize constructive 
interaction among organs of state power at all levels, local 
self-government, entrepreneurs, and public associations for 
comprehensive solutions to problems of economic development and 
provision of ecological safety. It was prepared taking into 
account the article of the new Russian Federation Constitution 
which proclaimed the right of each citizen to a healthy 
environment and also the principles of stable development 
presented in documents of the UN Conference on the Environment 
and Development (1992), to which our state was a signatory. 
  The model for stable development presupposes: 
  -- a balanced approach to solving problems of socioeconomic 
development and preservation of a favorable condition of the 
environment and natural resource potential; 
  -- both the restriction and elimination of unviable models 
of 
production and consumption and the surmounting of obstacles on 
the path to the development of entrepreneurship; 
  -- the elimination of distortions in state expenditures and 
the organization of efficient control, which should link an 
effective system of state administration to individual rules and 
capabilities of economic activity in the area of self-government 
as well. 
  But, getting away from official language and shifting to one 
that is generally comprehensible, in brief, the provision of 
ecological safety of stable development may be defined as the 
encouragement of environmental protection activity, that is, 
implementation of a favorable policy in the tax and financial 
spheres under conditions of development of market relations. In 
other words, economic activity (new economic policy) should 
ideally be oriented toward the achievement of economic 
well-being in combination with Russia's ecological safety. 
  The main directions of the ecological policy are formed from 
four sections which encompass, in the first place, problems of 
justified (that is, without damage to nature or the environment) 
distribution of productive forces and, correspondingly, 
everything related to the extraction of resources and salvaging 
and decontamination of production wastes. 
  Second, the creation of the healthiest possible living 
environment for man in cities and rural areas. 
  Third, the restoration of disturbed ecosystems in 
ecologically unfavorable regions, of which there are many. This 
includes also problems of protecting the Volga, Baykal, the 
Black and Caspian Seas, Lakes Onega and Ladoga, the Neva inlet, 
regions of the Far North, and also the Kavkazskiye Mineralnyye 
Vody health complex. 
  And, finally, there are global problems of the planet, 
particularly protection of the ozone layer and prevention of 
climatic changes, protection and restoration of forests, 
solutions to problems of the World Ocean, and so forth and so 
on...

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow Feb 26 TASS -- The Russian Defence Ministry 
is preparing an adequate substantiation for a Russian programme 
to destroy chemical weapons. 
  Commenting on aspects of this programme in Saturday's issue 
of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Chief of the General Staff of 
Russian Armed Forces Mikhail Kolesnikov noted that the Russian 
Defence Ministry is the state customer of work on the 
development of ecologically safe technologies for the 
destruction (utilisation) of chemical weapons. 
  According to the general, the Defence Ministry uses the 
principles of openness to choose adequate technologies, 
discusses, together with representatives from various regions, 
sections of the draft programme which are of interest to them. 
  The ministry actively helps the mass media and scientific 
publications in describing various aspects of chemical weapons' 
destruction. "The time of taking "hush-hush" decisions has gone 
long ago," the general staff chief stressed. 
  According to Kolesnikov, the production of chemical weapons 
in the former Soviet Union was discontinued in 1987 and has 
never been resumed. Their stockpiles were not replenished and 
not updated. 
  He stressed that the stockpiles of chemical weapons in 
Russia 
are under 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxic agents and are housed 
at seven arsenals specially equipped for their safe and reliable 
storage. 
  Russia will carry out the destruction of chemical weapons 
only at specially built facilities, the location of which will 
be determined by a government commission set up by the Russian 
president's decision of 9 August 1993, Kolesnikov continued. 
  In the general's opinion, "the safety of population and 
environment is the guiding condition for destruction". For this 
purpose, the Defence Ministry closely cooperates with regional 
and republican supervision bodies to conduct monitoring of 
public health and to take samples from surrounding terrain. 
  Such work has already been done near the city of Kambarkiy 
(Udmurtia), in the Krasnopartizanskiy (Gornyy village) and 
Volskiy (Shikhaniy village) districts of the Saratov region. 
  Skilled medics are invited to participate in this work. The 
results of population's medical checkups are reported to regions 
where this work is done.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been disclosed that a retired Russian Pacific 
Fleet nuclear submarine sank near a wharf in a port on the 
outskirts of Vladivostok in mid-February. Although there is no 
nuclear fuel aboard the submarine, it is equipped with nuclear 
reactors. As a result, there are fears about the danger of 
radiation pollution in the surrounding seas. 
  According to information given to NHK by concerned people in 
Moscow and Vladivostok, it is a November-class retired nuclear 
submarine, which was commissioned during the 1960's and belongs 
to the Russian Pacific Fleet. In mid-February the submarine 
sunk in water three meters deep near a wharf, where it was 
anchored, at a ship-repair yard in Tajima Bay [as heard], which 
is located in eastern part of Vladivostok. The site of the 
accident is now covered with thick ice. All that is visible of 
the submarine is its conning tower. The submarine is supported 
all round by ice so there is currently no danger of it tipping 
sideways. 
  There is no nuclear fuel aboard the aging submarine, which 
was waiting to be scrapped. However, it is still equipped with 
two nuclear reactors. As a result, concerned people say there 
is a danger the surrounding seas may become polluted with 
radiation when the ice starts to melt and the submarine tips 
sideways allowing water to enter the reactors. 
  Eight years ago there was an accident, dubbed Chernobyl, in 
Tajima Bay in the Maritime Kray in which a submarine sank and a 
large quantity of radiation leaked. There was reportedly an 
explosion in one of the nuclear submarine's reactors during work 
to replace nuclear fuel rods.

  [Text] Moscow Feb 24 TASS--If facilities for recycling 
liquid radioactive waste is not built in Russia's Far East 
within the next two months, Russia will possibly have to dump 
this waste in the Sea of Japan again in order to avert an 
ecological disaster. 
  A choice whether to build the appropriate recycling 
facilities estimated at about $10 million or to dump the waste 
in the sea is to be made by the Russian Government, according to 
Viktor Kutsenko, head of the Russian Ministry for Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources' Department for Ecological 
Safety. He also said the government was presently considering a 
request from the ministry to immediately solve the issue of 
waste disposal. 
  Taking into account the current financial difficulties and 
therefore uncertainty over the recycling facilities project, 
Russia did not join the London convention on a complete ban on 
dumping radioactive and industrial wastes in the seas, which 
took effect from 21 February. 
  Not acceding to the convention, Russia is losing 
politically, 
believes Valeriy Chelyukanov, a senior official at the Russian 
Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring. 
However, from the point of view of ecological safety, this 
decision was fully justified. If something happens to the 
tanker overloaded with liquid radioactive waste, which is now at 
moorage in the Zolotoy Rog bay near Vladivostok, the environment 
and people's health will be heavily damaged. 
  Waste dumping in the sea does not threaten a catastrophe. A 
high-speed tanker dumps its load in the open sea, and the wastes 
are instantly dissolved in the water. Taking into consideration 
the present radioactive contamination of the Sea of Japan, 
"Russia's supplement" will be negligible and not cause any 
damage for the environment.

<F P=106> [Article by Ibragim Buriyev, secretary of the Social </F>
Progress Party of Uzbekistan: "Kyzylkum: An Ecological Chernobyl 
Not Far Away"] 
  [Text] The expedition ARAL-88 traversed the channels of 
rivers that flow to the Aral Sea. It was composed of ecological 
scientists, writers, journalists, lawyers, economists, medical 
personnel, and agricultural specialists from various republics 
of the former USSR. A great deal was written about this in 
newspapers and magazines. Television showed frightful film clips 
of seagoing vessels in the desert sand... 
  Five years passed, and in 1993 it was decided to verify 
whether anything at all had been accomplished with respect to 
the commitments once made by the heads of the Ministry for Water 
Management and the secretaries of the Central Committees of the 
Communist Party of Central Asian republics and appropriate 
oblast committees. The result was depressing: Exactly nothing 
had changed. 
  The fact that the Aral Sea is gradually drying up, turning 
into a desert whose dust is scattered over thousands of 
kilometers, has already become a commonly known, dreadful 
reality. But no one has as yet seriously raised the question of 
just what man is doing with the desert. And something horrible 
is happening! Countless lakes have been formed in Kyzylkum into 
which water discharges saturated with toxic chemicals and 
fertilizers flow off from reservoirs. This water penetrates the 
sand and goes into wells from which the residents of the desert, 
livestock breeders, drink and provide water to their livestock. 
  Still greater destructive influence on the desert's 
ecosystem 
is being exerted by the mining and metallurgy industry. For more 
than 30 years now uranium, gold, and other metals have been 
extracted in these parts. In the region of Uchkuduk alone, more 
than 1.5 billion cubic meters of earth has been turned over, 
shoveled up. The area is strewn as well with mountainous heaps 
containing unextracted radioactive isotopes (radium, radon) 
whose dust is carried by the wind. 
  Funds for land reclamation were built into the cost 
estimate. 
In time, however, it was decided to use these very funds (!) to 
lower the cost of extraction. Developers of the technology 
involving the underground leaching method for extracting uranium 
have time and again received state awards and prizes. Among 
those awarded is Academician B. Laskorin, in whose view the 
method is ecologically clean. Doubting this, I--at that time a 
worker in the party apparatus--asked him to officially confirm 
the ecological safety of the method. The academician refused. 
Even at that time, information reached me from other scientists 
that with the application of this method, a minimum of 20 
percent of sulfuric acid remains in the underground seams. The 
desert's subsoil waters have been the first to suffer from 
this--transformed over time into little reservoirs of sulfuric 
acid poisoning the living desert around them. In the meantime, 
it is well known that these underground waters constitute 
precisely the main source of water in Kyzylkum. 
  A similar situation has come about with respect to the 
extraction of gold. Academician Laskorin has declared its 
technology as well to be ecologically clean, self-contained, and 
safe. "Any harmful influence to the environment can be ruled 
out--there is a minimum of airborne discharge and the complete 
absence of any kind of sewage"--these are the words of the 
academician. 
  But can we agree with such assurances? For over 24 years 
now, 
gold has been extracted from the Muruntau Mine near Zarafshan. 
The cost of extraction in 1970 was only about 3 rubles per gram. 
The fact of the matter is that it never even occurred to anyone 
to include in this cost expenses related to damage inflicted on 
the environment--sodium cyanide comprises part of the "waste" of 
this process. (It was also originally envisaged that the ground 
would be protected from penetration by this toxin--disposal 
channels were supposed to be covered with concrete on top of 
double-layer synthetic sheeting. About 1 million square meters 
of sheeting was purchased to this end, but it never used for its 
intended purpose--no one knows where it disappeared to.) Toxic 
pulp was poured off into low-lying areas, precisely where a 
geological fault line runs... 
  Gold reserves located in Uzbekistan amount to approximately 
4,500 tonnes. Over the past quarter century, more than 1,000 
tonnes of gold have been extracted from Muruntau alone. 
  The government presently intends to double the output of 
gold. This means that in about 10 years, only half of the 
republic's gold riches will remain, and in another 20-30 years 
virtually nothing will remain of this precious metal which 
nature has so generously provided the land. In this regard, 
whereas in Russia and a number of other republics of the former 
USSR an active process of reorganization of the economy is 
underway, no fundamental changes in this sphere have taken place 
in Uzbekistan over its two years of independence. The same state 
enterprises remain, virtually the same ruling cadre are there. 
There is not even any talk about privatization of enterprises, 
etc. 
  Accordingly, all precious metals and raw material resources 
being extracted will continue to go, as before, toward filling 
up holes and attempts to keep the unhealthy economy afloat. 
  But let us return to Kyzylkum. Everyone now knows full well 
that for over 30 years the USSR Ministry of Medium 
Machine-Building exercised absolute rule in this region. This 
ministry was a state within a state and operated under the stamp 
"Top Secret." It is this monster of developed socialism that did 
everything it desired in Kyzylkum. 
  The ministry passed away, but the ecologically 
unsophisticated technology fostered deep inside it continues to 
function... 
  And one more example of man's "creative" activity in 
Kyzylkum--the fate of the Gazli natural gas deposits opened up 
more than 40 years ago. 
  Transcontinental gas pipelines were laid in record short 
time: Bukhara-Urals and Bukhara-Center. Gas was pumped at such a 
rate that the deposits are today depleted. At one time the 
center (Moscow) promised to build the most beautiful city in the 
country here. But the sum total of what the people of Gazli 
received in payment for their labor comes to three destructive 
earthquakes, arising due to sharply reduced gas pressure in the 
underground seams. Moreover, thousands of rural inhabitants who 
live near Gazli to this day are unable to have natural gas piped 
through to their homes. 
  Imperial ideologues often reproached Uzbekistan for 
subsisting on budget grants, of dependency. But since 1969 over 
1,000 tonnes of gold has been shipped to the center and Uzbek 
uranium has been transported to the Union for more than 30 
years. All this took place and continues to take place at the 
cost of ruthless plunder of the desert. We are taking everything 
that is possible and even the impossible away from Kyzylkum and 
the Aral region, destroying fauna and flora, irresponsibly using 
up the wealth we should be leaving to our children. In the 
pursuit of exhaustible natural resources (gas, gold, uranium), 
we are sacrificing our sources of inexhaustible resources 
(karakul fur, livestock, water, etc.). 
  What are we returning to nature in exchange for its riches? 
What inheritance are we leaving to our children and 
grandchildren? Arsenic? Cyanide? A ruined environment? A damaged 
genetic pool? 
  I posed these questions back in 1978 before the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and before the 
CPSU Central Committee, but these difficult issues remained 
unanswered at that time. 
  I provided very detailed information to visiting officials 
from the center concerning the tragedy of the Aral Sea, its 
environs, and the desert of Kyzylkum. But these people were 
completely uninterested in the misfortune and needs of the 
region. 
  Instead of resolving ecological problems, they joined with 
investigators from the center under Ligachev's leadership and 
busied themselves with "putting things in order," deciding whom 
to arrest, exclude from the party, etc., and when. We do not yet 
know the full extent of the physical and moral damage inflicted 
upon the republic by such "landing force contingents." 
  Kyzylkum is an astonishingly rich area of our republic. The 
desert lacks only forest--it possesses an abundance of all other 
environmental resources. But in those places where just five 
years ago at least camel's thorn bloomed, today nothing grows. 
Inhabitants of the Central Asian republics have been sensing a 
change in climate for several years now. The Aral was talking to 
them! People's continued lack of action is both dangerous and 
criminal. 
  In previous times, citing secrecy considerations, the 
Ministry of Medium Machine-Building stood in the way. Time and 
circumstances forced us to develop the desert production of 
defense-oriented output. But now that the Cold War has ended, 
the empire has collapsed, and the newly independent republic is 
not in a state of military confrontation with other states, the 
time has come to change priorities, correct previously committed 
mistakes, and effect transition to the extraction of mineral 
resources using ecologically acceptable technologies. The 
tragedy of the Aral Sea and its environs lies partially on the 
conscience of the current leaders of countries of the region 
(many of whom occupied high-ranking and key positions previously 
as well in their republics). It is they who are obliged now to 
join forces, organize an all-encompassing study of the problem, 
and conduct immediate large-scale measures to save the Aral 
region, to improve the ecological environment and people's 
living conditions. Moreover, the scientific-technical potential 
and resources of the entire world community must be involved in 
this. 
  The desert has not yet become a dead zone. It still has its 
plant and animal world, and has been settled with people from 
time immemorial. But it is quite vulnerable and can easily be 
transformed into a truly lifeless space. It is impermissible for 
us to forget the frailty of the world of nature that surrounds 
us. Today's indifference to the tragedy of the Aral Sea and its 
environs, and to the problems of Kyzylkum (and of Karakum as 
well), is dooming us and our children to a new, ecological 
Chernobyl.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent M. Karlov report: "So Who Exactly </F>
Is Poisoning Us?"] 
  [Text] A conflict situation has now arisen in Russia 
because of the purchase and use of of foreign pesticides which 
have not undergone expert ecological and toxicological analysis. 
Over 500 domestically produced pesticides are authorized for 
use as it is, and counting all their various compounds and forms 
the figure runs into several tens of thousands. Every year the 
list of authorized pesticides is augmented by new preparations. 
This information was heard yesterday at a collegium of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. 
  Numerous research studies have shown that persistent stable 
pesticides are accumulating in the soil, ground sediments, 
plant-growing products, water, and living organisms. As a 
result various illnesses have arisen and the reproductive 
functions of people and animals and the functions of their 
genital organs have been disturbed. 
  All this is not surprising, because around 100,000 tonnes of 
unusable pesticides have accumulated at Russian Federation 
Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs depots alone, and the 
problem of disposing of them has still not been solved. Fish 
are dying as a result of poisoning. For example, two years ago 
two million fish died in the Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast) 
alone -- pike, roach, perch, carp, and silver carp. For the 
same reason insects -- the pollinators of plants -- are dying, 
and this is greatly reducing the yield of agricultural crops. 
It is no accident that in 1992 almost 1,000 violations of 
environmental protection requirements were detected.

  [Text] Seoul, 24 Feb -- The government of South Korea has 
received no notification from Russia that it will continue to 
dump its nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan unless it receives 
financial aid to build facilities for recycling this waste, an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was told in the department for 
environmental protection of the Foreign Ministry of the Republic 
of Korea. 
  The department's spokesman denied a report of the South 
Korean agency YONHAP, published on Wednesday, quoting anonymous 
sources as saying that the Russian Government has allegedly told 
Seoul and Tokyo that it will inevitably dump into the open sea 
the nuclear waste from atomic submarines unless other ways of 
its disposal could be found. The agency claims that the Seoul 
government does not even consider offering material support to 
Russia in building facilities for recycling this waste because 
the question of recovery of Russia's arrears in repaying South 
Korean credits has not yet been resolved. 
  In this respect, the representative of the South Korean 
Foreign Ministry said that these allegations "do not reflect at 
all the real stance" of the government of the Republic of Korea. 
The possibility of offering help to Russia is now being 
considered, he said, refusing, however, to go into further 
detail. According to him, such reports divorced from reality, 
which appear in the South Korean press, "bring nothing but 
deterioration of the relations between the two countries."

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Seoul Not Giving In to Moscow's </F>
Blackmail"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The problem of the Pacific Fleet's 
radioactive waste has once again taken center stage in Japan and 
South Korea. 
  The prologue to this "renaissance" was Russia's refusal to 
join the international ban on dumping toxic waste at sea. Tokyo 
has assessed this action as a sign of preparation for new 
dumping operations in the Sea of Japan. The government's 
environmental protection agency has issued a special statement 
on this subject. 
  Things did not end there, however, being continued in a 
rather spicy way. Citing government sources, the South Korean 
news agency YONHAP reported that the Russian side has sent an 
unprecedented notification to Seoul, formulated in the style of 
mild blackmail, according to Korean assessments. The Russian 
document, the agency writes, sets forth the following 
alternative: Either Seoul, together with Tokyo, immediately 
provides money for the construction of land-based capacities for 
the processing of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste, or 
Russia dumps another portion of toxic muck, generated by 150 
nuclear submarines in its fleet, in the waters of the Sea of 
Japan. 
  At the official level, the Korean side has announced that at 
present it does not intend to allocate any additional funds for 
erecting land-based purification and processing installations. 
At the same time, Seoul has stressed that there can be no 
question of new credits for Russia until the problem of the 
existing major Russian debt is resolved.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Frolov under the rubric "Drama": "The </F>
Disappearance of the State Committee on Chernobyl Will Be a 
Shock Not Only to Its Supporters. 70 Percent of the Residents of 
`Contaminated' Areas Need Social Protection"] 
  [Text] It seems that in the near future the State Committee 
of the Russian Federation on Social Protection of Civilians and 
Rehabilitation of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other 
Radiation Catastrophes, called simply Goskomchernobyl, will 
cease to exist. Along with other committees of a similar rank, 
it is a part of the GKChS [State Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery 
from Natural Disasters]. Quite understandably, this disturbs the 
workers, although not all of them, of course. Not the workers 
but interested individuals, of whom there are many times more, 
are disturbed by one extremely significant aspect of this 
departmental cataclysm. The GKChS does not intend to take the 
administration of social protection under its "mantle." Thus 
the main function of Goskomchernobyl will atrophy to a 
significant degree--it will have to be performed by the Ministry 
of Social Protection, which has enough problems of its own 
without orphan children and the elderly. 
  Plenty has been said about the "Chernobyl" benefits and 
payment increments. It is clear that they are very costly and 
will continue to be costly. Experts of the Ministry of Finance 
think that in 1994 alone payments will exceed 1 trillion rubles 
[R]. Many are eager to raise a dispute over this material and 
financial aspect. Many fewer are willing to discuss the social, 
not to mention the psychological aspects. But workers of the 
Department for Studying the Medical and Psychological 
Consequences of the Disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Plant of the State Scientific Center for Social and Judicial 
Psychiatry imeni Serbskiy think that as of the present moment 
these aspects are the main ones. The newspaper SEGODNYA has 
already written about the higher level of neurotic symptoms 
discovered by these researchers among the population of the 
contaminated areas, caused primarily by the extremely 
contradictory information about the scale of the danger. The 
masters Freud and Bekhterev back in their day noted that 
increased receptivity to suggestion and the preference of rumors 
over official information are typical of mass psychology. Under 
Soviet conditions it was quite predictable that these features 
would be hypertrophied and become a way of directing perception. 
Another thing was surprising: Despite expectations, in time the 
consequences of stress did not disappear, although none of the 
people residing in the affected territories could experience any 
apparent results from the action of small doses of radiation. 
Actually, it was the latter circumstance that contributed to a 
situation where stress became chronic. In this case the "Soviet 
consciousness" does not come into play. The same thing happened 
with Americans after the disaster at the Three Mile Island (TMI) 
power plant in 1979. One can understand why it was that six 
years later when a reactor in good repair was started up at 
Three Mile Island the indicators of alarm and depressive 
disorders there increased. 
  It is not so obvious but nonetheless a fact that the most 
diverse stress loads which have nothing to do with the radiation 
danger can just as successfully aggravate nervous disorders and 
all the quite physical ailments that go with them. In the 
opinion of the leader of the Department for Studying the Medical 
and Psychological Consequences, Galina Rumyantseva, social and 
economic factors are undoubtedly included among these 
"starters." It goes without saying, of course, that 
macroeconomics does not rank high among them. For example, it 
was discovered that mass deterioration of the psychological and, 
correspondingly, physical condition was brought about by delays 
in payment of wages, which are now commonplace. But one need be 
neither a medical expert nor a psychic to imagine the dynamic 
evoked by the abolition of compensatory payments. Incidentally, 
this has already begun. Benefits for people living on areas with 
background indicators of radioactivity of from 1 to 5 curies per 
square kilometer have been eliminated. The rest, whose future 
became uncertain, immediately started to feel worse. 
  There would hardly be any point to thinking about all that 
was said above outside the environment of psychologists and 
psychiatrists. Unfortunately, the consequences can (and this is 
precisely what happens most of the time) be outside their 
professional competence. There are 2.6 million Russians living 
in zones of radioactive contamination from the disaster at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant alone, and 2.2 million of them are 
receiving benefits and additional payments. Incidentally, the 
average level of wages in these regions was deliberately lowered 
since it was assumed that the additional payments, which now 
come to about four times the minimum wage, would serve as an 
additional source of income. And the level of health of the 
population cannot even be compared with that in the so-called 
"clean areas": Control studies showed that the incidence of 
vegeto-vascular dystonia and functional disorders are 10 times 
greater in Novozybkovskiy Rayon than in Tver, where out of every 
10,000 studied, only three were affected. 
  And so medical experts warn that abolishing the benefits 
will 
lead to a clear negative reaction. When it follows from this 
that millions of people will actually be "excluded" from life 
and more than 10 oblasts along with them, there is something to 
think about. Actually, there will be nothing unexpected in their 
behavior--almost from the very beginning of the Chernobyl saga 
these people were bearers of so-called rent psychology which, to 
be truthful, was imposed upon them. Its main feature is social 
passivity and a desire to place responsibility for their 
well-being on others. There is no need to go into detail about 
the possible consequences of such a world view: Practically 
every post-Soveticus manifests it to one degree or 
another or else has been fortunate enough to rid himself of it 
only in the recent past. Among the sufferers, access to benefits 
was a measure of success in life even irrespective of their 
actual value. For example, it would never occur to anyone that 
to send children to vacation in Australia--at the expense of 
their hosts, of course--would mean to give them at least another 
annual dose which they would receive during the flight. 
Incidentally, it would be naive to think that transoceanic 
voyages and foreign diagnosis are available to all residents of 
the contaminated territories. Near the rayon center of 
Novozybkovo there is a village called Zlynka. It is a rayon 
center too, although, according to testimony from people who 
have visited there, one gets the impression that the distance 
between it and Novozybkovo, which is visited by foreigners, is 
not 20 km but at least a half century. And our achievements if 
not at cleaning up then, as the physicians express it, in coping 
with the consequences of the disaster suffer from such contrasts 
as well. On the one hand there is our fairly successful policy 
of resettlement which, in the opinion of specialists in any 
case, surpasses similar actions taken in Belarus and Ukraine in 
terms of many parameters, and on the other--there is the absence 
for seven years in a row of reliable information on the doses 
received by the population. We still have not conducted an 
individual study of the residents. Of course, this is difficult 
work, but the majority of medical experts have no doubt about 
the need for it: It has repeatedly happened that on fairly clean 
territories there have been random people who have received a 
considerable dose of radiation. The prospects look fairly grim. 
It seems that only psychiatrists and psychologists have clearly 
formulated their ideas about them and, being specialists, in 
spite of the well-known Prutkov aphorism, they do not want to be 
one-sided like a gumboil and are hoping for cooperation from 
their colleagues. For example, endocrinologists, since increased 
pathology in this area is inevitable. It is too soon to close 
the question of the effects of small doses of radiation as 
well--thus for a long time allopathists have closed their eyes 
to the homeopathy but it still has not ceased to exist. 
  So far medical experts have been engaged in organizing a 
kind 
of assistance for which there was an obvious need. Some 70 
percent of the residents of the contaminated territories were in 
favor of organizing a sociopsychological service there. The 
first and, from all appearances, last center will begin to 
operate in the next three months. Funds have been allotted by 
Goskomchernobyl for a year--the center's subsequent destiny is 
unknown. But it is known that the network of such institutions 
for children has remained, as it were, in the planning stage. 
Incidentally, they, along with their mothers, are in the risk 
group. Also included are educators and local medical personnel. 
The latter, true, might be, as they like to put it, 
"compensated." But this can hardly be said about the majority of 
residents of "contaminated" rayons, who have perceived the 
disappearance of Goskomchernobyl as a loss of a protector. It 
seems that this time the supporters of shock therapy have 
allowed an overload.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chemical Weapons Threaten Volga </F>
Region. Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"] 
  [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have 
been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip 
out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers 
[yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is 
what the draft first stage of the state program for the 
destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local 
residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long 
time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new 
installations with this kind of specialism. 
  Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993. 
According to the Convention, the first installation for the 
destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years 
at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still 
has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical 
weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances 
from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the 
arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast. 
  The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225 
tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are 
stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that 
have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad 
tankers, pose a potential danger. 
  The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a 
factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out 
at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive 
matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the 
top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology 
[SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is 
located. 
  Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's 
director, said that several technologies have been developed for 
the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy. 
Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas, 
a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and 
its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most 
preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be 
recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in 
microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals. 
In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only 
expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also 
considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents 
into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently 
produce. 
  This technology can also be used to recycle 
arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent 
produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany 
from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000 
tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing 
range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian 
adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public 
but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the 
possible environmental contamination from these stocks. 
  It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular 
problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is 
only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal 
and recycling installations that are holding things up. 
However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical 
weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas 
right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for 
the residents of the area since the environmental background 
here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for 
instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow 
flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times 
in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to 
three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which 
contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.

  [Text] Yerevan, Mar 4 (SNARK) -- Levon Zurabyan, the acting 
press-secretary of the Armenia's president, refuted today 
information of some mass media that Armenia "is going to use the 
Azerbaijani territory occupied by Karabakh for burning 
radioactive waste of the Armenian nuclear power station". He 
called these rumors a propaganda trick. 
  In the interview to the SNARK reporter, Mr. Zurabyan 
expressed an opinion that such rumors are spread out in order to 
prevent renewing of the Armenian nuclear power station's work 
and thereby not to allow Armenia to have an independent energy 
source. 
  Meanwhile, as he pointed out, by spreading out, Azerbaijan 
makes a vain attempt to prove that Armenia infringes on the 
Azerbaijan's territory and even is going to use it for own 
purposes. 
  Mr. Zurabyan said that absurdity of these statements is 
obvious.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 28 BNS -- The Estonian Environment 
Ministry released a report according to which environmental 
damage last year amounted to 6.2 million kroons. The sum of 
compensation for it reached 1.8 million kroons. 
  Damage to forest accounted for 5.4 million kroons and a 1.2- 
million-kroon chunk of the compensation money went to make 
reparation for it. 
  The sum covers only the damage caused to the state and the 
local governments, but not the losses of private persons. 
  Estonia lacks an integral system of forest supervision and 
nature conservation in general, Henn Alton, Environment 
Ministry's deputy chief conservation inspector, said at a press 
conference. 
  Regional nature preservation work rests on enthusiasts with 
long experience. In the future it may become impossible to find 
experienced workers because of low pay and lack of equipment, 
Chief Inspector Heiki Nurmsalu said. Local budgets are at 
present short of funds for buying special technology without 
which a conservation inspector's work is impossible, he added. 
  The Sea Inspectorate registered last year 1,118 violations 
of 
fishing regulations, which caused damage to the tune of 188,000 
kroons; 114,000 kroons was recovered in compensation. 
  The inspectorate has joined forces with the Border Guard 
Department and the Police Department to protect fish resources 
and water bodies, inspectorate head Aado Luksep said. As a 
result, a satisfactory situation in fish protection in East 
Virumaa, for example, has been achieved, he added. 
  Head of Environment Ministry's radiation and atmosphere 
department Jaan Saar voiced the opinion that radiation control 
on the border needs to be stepped up to prevent import of 
radioactive metal into Estonia.

<F P=106> [Report by Iryna Andriychuk and Oleksandr Havrosh: "New </F>
Year 'Oil Presents' From Santa Claus"] 
  [Excerpts] Who said that Ukraine lacks oil? At least, on 
New Year's Eve, our state literally poured diesel fuel to 
Slovakia. However, it was not our fault. An accident on the oil 
pipeline close to Polyana in Svalylavskiy Rayon became a real 
ecological disaster and caused a fuss around the world. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some time ago, this pipeline secretly met the requirements 
of 
the defense industry of the Council for Mutual Economic 
Cooperation. Its headquarters is still located in Samara [in 
Russia], while its Transcarpathia Department is situated in 
Rovno [in Ukraine]. This department has two oil reservoirs -- 
in Dubrinichi village (Perechinskiy Rayon) and Rososhi village 
(Svalyavskiy Rayon). 
  At 1500 on 30 December 1993, Samara began pumping oil under 
very high pressure. It is clear that a handmade pipe collar 
broke and diesel fuel made its way to Europe by way of the river. 
  Unfortunately, the accident took place on 31 December, on 
New 
Year's Eve, when all the personnel were deep in thought sitting 
around the table. The State Department for Environmental 
Protection did everything possible to mobilize as many people as 
possible into action. [passage omitted] 
  An enormous oil spill spread for kilometers and eventually 
crossed the state border. People who saw the Latoritsa River at 
that time, witnessed a terrible sight. The entire river was 
covered with foam and a layer of oil. 
  Though the State Department for Environmental Protection 
phoned everyone, everywhere, the officials in Chop were not 
quick enough in closing the water-intake valves from the river. 
This was how diesel fuel got into the city water system, making 
the water unfit to drink. 
  Even on 9 January, the Latoritsa River near Chop was still 
covered with oil. The environment has been irreversibly 
damaged. The safety measures cost a lot of money. However, this 
is just the beginning, because we cannot avoid international 
responsibility for the contamination of the river. The Slovaks 
promised to hold back, but this oil slick continued on to 
Hungary, so when Budapest makes out a bill to Bratislava for 
damages, we will have to pay it. [passage omitted] 
  The Prosecutors' Office should put an end to such 
irresponsibility. Oil and gas pipelines should be properly 
guarded. This is an axiom. Otherwise, we will have not a 
flourishing Transcarpathia but a new Chernobyl monster.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference held at the Environment Ministry </F>
in Kiev on 3 March, by Edvard Kotenko -- passage within 
quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Ukrainian Environment Minister Yuriy Kostenko 
invited journalists for a briefing on the results of his 
official visits to the Netherlands and the United States. The 
minister was commissioned to visit Haag by the Ukrainian Cabinet 
of Ministers. In Haag, a memorandum on mutual understanding 
regarding ecological cooperation was signed. Precisely how can 
the Netherlands help Ukraine? Although it is a small country, 
it has much experience in resolving ecological problems. The 
following was said on this topic by Yuriy Kostenko: 
  Kostenko: "During the negotiations, emphasis was 
put on practical activities that are possible given the current 
situation in Ukraine. An entire range of concrete topics was 
proposed. First of all, there is ecological management and 
planning, protection of air, water resources, and protection of 
nature. Regarding practical implementation of these issues, we 
agreed to work out so-called pilot or demonstrative projects in 
each of these areas, meaning projects that could be financed and 
implemented in Ukraine. Based on these projects, we will be 
able to teach our specialists and pressure the appropriate 
authorities, to expand this experience to other territories. 
What does it mean? For example, regarding the quality of 
drinking water, we have requested that they help us work out an 
appropriate project and establish laboratories to control the 
quality of drinking water. This can be done with the help of 
money allocated by the Dutch Government. I expect that concrete 
results of the signing of this agreement will be visible this 
year." 
  The second part of the news conference was devoted to Yuriy 
Kostenko's visit to the United States at the invitation of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. The minister briefed 
journalists on meetings with his U.S. colleagues, 
representatives of the World Bank, the Agency for International 
Development, and the Energy Department, as well as congressmen. 
As was emphasized, U.S. state departments expressed their 
interest in cooperating with Ukraine in the area of ecology, 
particularly, in establishing modern laboratories, conducting 
radiological monitoring, controlling the quality of water, 
reprocessing toxic waste, broadcasting ecological- educational 
television and radio programs, and developing an information and 
education center similar to the Kiev-Mohylanska Academy. The 
U.S. side is planning to allocate $6 million to these modest 
but, as we expect, fruitful projects.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Weapons Are a Disgrace"] </F>
  [Text] Ukraine's Green Party [PZU] has disseminated a 
statement in support of the decision adopted by Ukraine's 
president and Supreme Council on the total renunciation of 
nuclear weapons. 
  The PZU believes that clinging to the nuclear "cudgel" could 
lead to Ukraine's isolation in the world community, and the 
possession of nuclear weapons today is not valor, but disgrace. 
  Since PZU members are convinced that the high post of a 
public figure is incompatible with militaristic mentality, the 
Greens also demand that Minister of Environmental Protection 
Yuriy Kostenko, who was against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, 
be dismissed from his post. 
  The PZU statement was also supported by the Ukrainian 
association "Green World," which is concerned about possible 
ecological consequences of the careless handling of the 
technology by the military. Examples of such cases were quoted 
at the news conference held by the association.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksiy Petrunya: "Yuriy Kostenko: We Are Not </F>
Against Nuclear Energy as Such, but ... against Its Present 
Level of Security"] 
  [Text] Ukraine needs a clear concept of the development of 
nuclear energy, worked out on the basis of the world's 
experience. Yuriy Kostenko stated this in conversation with the 
correspondent of Ukrinform. He stated that this is the opinion 
of his ministry. We have never come out against, and are not 
coming out against nuclear energy as such, understanding that 
the future energy security of the state is connected with the 
employment of nuclear energy. But the level of security of the 
nuclear power stations evokes concern. 
  Unfortunately, the minister said, the departments which are 
responsible for them often follow only their own concerns, and 
pay attention only to the positive aspects of nuclear energy. 
Our fundamental goal is to do everything so that all branches of 
the economy do the least possible harm to people and to nature. 
  Analyzing the world's experience with the development of 
nuclear energy, one comes to the conclusion, that it is not as 
effective as the ministries concerned imagine. And in this, the 
most telling is the experience of the United States, where the 
majority of nuclear stations belong to private companies. It 
shows that the cost of the electricity produced by nuclear power 
stations is approximately one and a half times higher than that 
produced by stations which use gas or coal. And this is in 
addition to the fact that in the United States the equipment is 
much more advanced than here. 
  In speaking about the ecological aspect, it is true that if 
the station functions normally, it ejects into the atmosphere 
few harmful substances, compared with other energy producers. 
Nuclear power stations are ecologically cleaner, and their 
operation does not cause air pollution. This is a plus. But the 
minus side also cannot be forgotten. Accidents at nuclear 
stations can lead to disastrous consequences. The Chernobyl 
tragedy and events at other stations show this. 
  Yuriy Kostenko emphasized that nuclear energy has to exist, 
but to act on different principles. That is, to be economically 
effective and ecologically secure. First of all, a closed 
nuclear cycle has to be created, which can guarantee a lower 
level of ecological danger. Another way is the development of 
less powerful but more effective reactors. In fact, this program 
is now being studied in the United States. In this approach, new 
types of reactors can be brought to such a degree of security 
that, in any sort of accident, ejections of radioactive 
substances do not go beyond the boundary of the thermal shell. 
If we choose this way, the development of nuclear energy in 
Ukraine will proceed successfully. All the more so because we 
have the industrial base for it, and personnel, and experience. 
But with all this, we still lack a clear, and well reasoned and 
calculated concept of its development. 
  Speaking about the aspects of nuclear energy characteristic 
of the past year, Yuriy Kostenko pointed out that countries 
using nuclear power stations have encountered a series of 
complex problems. One of these is the security of the fuel. 
Previously, the government took care of this completely, 
allotting a great deal of money from the budget. Thus, the cost 
of fuel did not have an effect on the price of electrical 
energy. But now, when the majority of so called imposed expenses 
are imposed onto the stations, the price of electrical energy 
will grow. Another complex problem is connected with the 
exhausted fuel. It proved to be an especially difficult issue 
last year. A critical situation developed at the Rivnenska, 
Khmelnytska, and Zaporizka stations, where the storage areas at 
the stations were already overfilled. Unquestionably, this 
situation will force us to consider the necessity of creating 
national storage areas for exhausted fuel, to seek ways of 
acquiring fuel at cheap prices, and possibly to organize 
industries for this in Ukraine. 
  The Supreme Council of Ukraine has cancelled the moratorium 
for bringing new nuclear power station blocs on line. I do not 
think, Yuriy Kostenko said, that it is necessary to bring them 
all on line. The three which are at the highest level of 
readiness are enough. I think, the minister emphasized again, 
that without the development of nuclear energy, though of a 
higher qualitative level, we will not be able to function.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's Environmental Protection Minister 
Yuriy Kostenko on 1 March returned from his working trip to the 
United States. There, he met representatives of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, World Bank, Agency for 
International Development, Department of Energy, and 
congressmen. Representatives of U.S. state bodies expressed 
their great interest in cooperation with Ukraine in the sphere 
of ecology and examined a package of proposals on steps to be 
taken as a matter of priority to improve the state of Ukraine's 
environment, presented by Yuriy Kostenko. Among them, in 
particular, were setting up some of the most up-to-date 
laboratories to monitor the radiological quality of water, 
organizing the disposal of toxic waste, making educational TV 
programs on ecology, and developing the MinPryrody 
[Environmental Protection Ministry] informational and 
educational center. The American side is planning to allocate 
$6 million to implement these projects. Commenting on this 
report, the MinPryrody press center added that ecological 
projects would be financed by the U.S. Agency for International 
Cooperation. It has long cooperated with Ukraine, and, in 
particular, will take part in privatization processes. This 
agency recently opened its headquarters in Kiev. It is this 
headquarters that will directly support various projects in 
Ukraine financially and methodologically.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: "European Consortium </F>
Expands Back to Feedstock Process"] 
  [Text] DSM [Dutch State Mines], together with four large 
European concerns, including BP Chemicals, has set up a 
consortium for chemical recycling. The five companies are to 
expand a so-called "back to feedstock" process, involving a 
method developed by BP Chemicals, in which plastic waste 
mixtures are broken down into oleaginous products. A pilot 
plant at Grangemouth, Scotland, is already in operation. 
  The plant in Grangemouth has a capacity of 100 kilograms per 
hour, and around ten million Dutch guilders have been put into 
the project. In addition to BP and DSM, the participants are 
the petrochemical concerns Elf-Atochem, Petrofina and Enichem. 
DSM primarily conducts research into the products resulting 
from the process. The company has a small naphtha cracker for 
that purpose. 
  Interest in "back to feedstock" methods (or chemical 
recycling) has increased enormously in the last few years. One 
important reason is that recycling of different synthetic 
mixtures produces quite some problems. Such mixtures can almost 
only be recycled into lean materials which usually end up as 
flower pots or roadside poles. The market for such products is 
small and is nearly saturated. A not yet socially acceptable 
alternative for materials recycling is the recovery of its 
energy content by combustion. 
<H5>  Smaller Pieces </H5>
  "Back to feedstock" (or chemical recycling) is a third 
option. The aim of the technique involved is to disintegrate the 
polymer material into smaller pieces, in some cases even back to 
the original chemical ingredients. "Back to feedstock" methods 
are currently being researched all over the world. 
  The process which BP and DSM are examining turns the plastic 
waste into an oleaginous product, from which low hydrocarbons 
can be produced through petrochemical techniques. It produces a 
wax-like product which can be used as a starting material for 
naphtha crackers. 
  The base material for the BP/DSM process is waste synthetics 
from household garbage. Before the process can begin, the 
plastic fragments must be separated from the rest of the 
household waste. The isolated plastic fragments are then ground 
into pieces of two centimeter. This granulate is the base 
material for the cracking process that comes next. 
  The disintegration, in which the original long polymer 
chains 
are broken into pieces, takes place in an fluidized bed 
incinerator, which is partially filled with sand. When a 
current of hot air is blown in, the actual fluidized bed comes 
into being. The waste plastic is thermally crushed at a 
temperature of between 400 and 600 degrees Celsius, and produces 
a steam mixture of hydrocarbons. Ninety percent of these gases 
finally condense into a low molecule wax. The remaining 10 
percent are used as fuel which meets the energy requirements of 
the installation. The remains of additives in the original 
plastic -- such as fillings and pigments -- are left behind in 
the sand. Hydrochloric acids resulting from the crushing of PVC 
are removed separately. 
  In general, DSM regards "back to feedstock" techniques as a 
promising option which, it is true, does not promise a complete 
solution for the problem of synthetic waste, but which is a 
valuable partial solution, next to alternative processing 
methods such as combustion (energy recovery) or material 
recycling. In 1990 the Netherlands produced 850,000 tonnes of 
synthetic waste, of which 150,000 was recycled. According to 
the environmental policy plan, that last quota will have to 
reach 450,000 tonnes by the turn of the century.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High-Speed Sorter for Plastic </F>
Parts"] 
  [Text] A consortium of European companies and research 
organisations has won a research contract worth nearly Ecu 1.5m 
from the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) to develop 
a system for the identification and separation of plastics in 
mixed waste. The consortium's proposal -- submitted under the 
CEC's Brite-Euram Industrial and Materials Technologies 
Programme -- was awarded an A1 (outstanding) assessment in 
competition with over 1,250 proposals. 
  The proposed system has major implications for the 
efficiency 
and cost effectiveness of recycling plastics by detecting 
specially developed 'tracers' added in minute quantities to the 
various plastics used by the packaging, automotive and other 
industries. The tracers will be detected by an advanced device 
using the latest fluorosensor technology. 
  One benefit of the system is that it is able not only to 
detect different generic plastics but also to segregate 
different grades of the same material. The potential for 
identifying and separating a wide range of different plastics 
types and grades is virtually unlimited. 
  The system is unique in being able to identify plastics 
containing black and other strongly absorbing colours. It is 
also able to operate with materials which are surface 
contaminated, the system will also be able to identify and 
reject specific unwanted materials. 
  A product of the contract will be a pilot sorting machine; 
this will be capable of making at least 100 identifications and 
of sorting plastics at speeds of at least 10 articles/s. 
Proving trials will take place at a waste management site. 
  The consortium comprises: Pira International, UK -- lead 
contractor and project co-ordinator; Bayer AG, Germany -- will 
develop fluorescent tracers under its own patent; Cranfield 
University (RMCS), UK -- will develop a sensitive detection 
system using fluorosensor technology; Newell Engineering, UK -- 
will create handling systems for high speed segregation of 
plastics articles and construct a pilot sorting machine; APME, 
Technical and Environment Centre (formerly PWMI), Belgium -- 
responsible for proving the processability of the tracers and 
the conversion of plastic containing them into three dimensional 
articles; and Laboratoire National d'Essais France -- 
responsible for checking the stability of the tracer/polymer 
systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Aila Kayhty: "The Woodpecker's Nest Tree and the </F>
Gnarly Pine Are Still Standing"] 
  [Text] Savonlinna -- An ever-strengthening hum followed the 
group walking in the deep snow when the line of people got on to 
Iso-Kankainen Island. "Has any wood at all been harvested here?" 
the Forest Association men asked jokingly. 
  Everybody knew well that, during the summer of 1993, 830 
cubic meters of wood had been harvested from 7.4 hectares of 
this Lake Pihlajavesi island containing the summer cabin of 
Savonlinna resident, Timo Auvinen. Two clear-cut sites of less 
than 1 hectare had been hid into the interior of the island. The 
alders on the shores had been left entirely untouched. The 
logger, Pekka Mielonen, had left the woodpecker's nest tree and 
the gnarly pine standing. 
  Timo Auvinen was thankful for this environmental deed of the 
logging crew. In this way the forestry principles of his father, 
who died a couple of years ago, were respected. The Forest 
Association leaders praised Mielonen, who has the skill to 
harvest wood from the forest neatly and without harming the 
environment. 
  Mielonen confessed to having worked in the same manner as he 
did when working for the corporation for 20 years. "But only now 
am I starting to get recognition." 
  Auvinen's forest tract had been selected in an internal 
Forest Association contest as the target harvest tract for the 
year. Choosing a privately owned forest for the harvest sent out 
the message that an effort is being made to teach also the 
private forest owners friendliness toward the environment. 
Nowadays every seller of stumpage, the timber or pulpwood from 
the forest, is offered a harvesting plan in which the 
environment is taken into consideration. 
  The majority of stumpage sellers have regarded the offer in 
a 
positive way, said Juhani Hongisto, regional chief of the Forest 
Association's Southeast Finland Harvest Region. 
  In the Savonlinna Harvesting District 150 loggers were 
trained last year to regard the little dells and rills in a new 
way. In the managing of its own forests the Forest Association 
has followed environmentally sound instructions since already in 
1986. Already prior to that operators of machinery were ordered 
to take care of waste oil. 
  According to Hongisto, the Greenpeace writings about Finnish 
destruction of forests forced those with forest interests to 
promote the current style of harvesting. 
<H5>  Training for Loggers Almost Complete </H5>
  The big forest products firms -- Kymmene, Inc., 
Enso-Gutzeit, 
Inc., United Paper Manufacturers, Inc., and the Forest 
Association -- are eagerly promoting the guidelines for the new, 
environmentally friendly harvesting methods. The guidelines have 
been drafted cooperatively by the Forest Service, the industry 
and organizations with interests in the field. The 
easy-to-understand, picture book-like publications lead the 
reader to forest scenes where the ants and flying squirrels live 
happily even after the logger has finished his job. 
  The key people to contact are the loggers and forest 
machinery operators. Most loggers are already trained, and 
training is continuing in some companies this year. 
  Enso-Gutzeit has earned bonus points for promising to 
protect 
marble seal waters from forest harvests and fishing. A decision 
has been made to relocate the blue-winged ridge butterfly from 
Satakunta to its former habitat in Ruokolahti. Only 
biodegradable oils will be permitted in forest machinery from 
this year on. 
  One should never belittle the impact of impressions. Erkki 
Nieminen, Enso-Gutzeit environmental chief, who has just 
returned from work in Germany, knows that the Central European 
tourist forms his impressions of the Finnish forests from behind 
a car steering wheel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Toxins Washed Into Baltic Sea"] </F>
  [Text] Treaties and regulations decree how the wash waters 
of ships carrying chemicals as cargo must be treated. Special 
inspectors monitor compliance with the stipulations in Finnish 
ports and violators can be prosecuted. In practice, ships that 
have no concern in this regard, can dump the wash waters from 
their cargo space straight into the sea almost without any peril 
of being held accountable. 
  The inspectors do not always, not even nearly always, know 
where to search for concealed wash water. In suspicious cases 
expert advice is available only during office hours, and the 
vessels cannot be detained in port merely on suspicion, as is 
the case in Central Europe. If a violator is occassionally 
brought to court, the possible fine is insignificant when 
compared to the profit gained through the environmental crime. 
  By neglecting to comply with Baltic Sea protection measures, 
violators take over the markets from law abiding suppliers. The 
lack of concern by the responsible seafaring and environmental 
authorities is incomprehensible, considering how an 
exceptionally fragile marine ecosystem is being polluted. 
  Finland has obligated itself, together with the other Baltic 
coastal countries, to prevent and decrease the environmental 
pollutant burden on the Baltic Sea. Even the mere improvement in 
conveying information between unloading port and loading port 
would prevent vessels from matter-of-factly dumping the tank 
wash waters on their voyage.

<F P=106> [Article by Sauli Korpimo: "Spruce Deteriorating in Southern </F>
Finnish Forests"] 
  [Text] Southern Finland's spruce are sick. They grow taller 
tortuously, shed yellowed needles and dry up standing. The 
forests are atrophying over even hundreds of hectares. 
Widespread die-offs of trees have not been discovered, but in 
almost every forested tract individual, dying trees are found as 
well as small clusters of dying trees. 
  "Forests always contain dead and suffering spruce trees, but 
now there are more than the usual number. What we have here is 
not trees with stem rot from the top or trees deteriorating from 
old age. The most worrisome aspect is that even the best-managed 
forests are suffering," says Olavi Laiho, director of the Forest 
Research Institute's research station in Parkano. 
  Until now assurances have been given that the forests will 
withstand the damage as long as they are well managed. 
<H5>  Height Growth Rate Plunged </H5>
  According to Laiho, the most visible change is the collapse 
of height growth rate to near zero levels. Another strange thing 
is that the trees are very light in weight and fragile; they do 
not contain water. 
  Laiho is unable to say what is plaguing the trees. "This is 
not my field, but I have tried to alert other researchers." 
  He has suggested that researchers from the Forest Research 
Institute go look at a deteriorating forest in Hattula that 
covers hundreds of hectares and ponder how the sick forest 
should be treated and how the deterioration should be studied. 
  The health of trees is determined by their needle loss. The 
method is not considered very reliable. Olavi Laiho suggests 
that the assesment of a tree's vitality also take note of the 
height growth, the moisture content of the woody matter, the 
proportion of heartwood to sapwood, and the changes taking place 
in the needles. 
  The drying up of the wood might be taking place because the 
roots have been damaged so that they cannot draw water, or 
because the needles are damaged so that the water is lost. 
Drought does not instantly kill a tree. It lives tortuously for 
a long time. 
  "In the world of trees there have not really been changes in 
any other things besides the contents of the air and rain and 
possibly in the ground. Variations in temperature and rainfall 
account quite well for many things, but damages would occur in 
the same patterns as these causes show. A frail tree becomes ill 
in an adverse year. In more favorable conditions it would get 
along for a little while longer. The issue here is: What has 
happened to the resistance capacity of the trees?" 
  When he says changes Laiho is talking about increases in air 
pollution and the impact this has had. 
  Last summer Dr. Laiho visited the forests of southern 
Sweden. 
"They are really in a wretched condition, almost all of them 
half brown, clearly less healthy than Finnish forests." But 
Laiho still feels it is the same phenomenon. 
<H5>  Nobody Wants To Believe a Self-Taught Forest Researcher </H5>
  Hyvinkaa -- Might Matti Juhonsalo be right after all? Could 
it be possible that a self-taught forest researcher might have a 
sharper eye and more accurate measuring stick than the 
professors and ministers do? 
  For years Juhonsalo has transported researchers and 
politicians in the forests and argued that the talk about good 
growth in the forests is nonsense. Trees no longer have height 
growth. Particularly the spruce trees are sick and dry up 
standing. 
  He is aware of severely ill forests, for example, in his 
home 
parish of Jokioinen, in Loimaa rural parish, in Nakkila, in 
Karkkila, in Tammela, in Eura, and in all of the parishes of 
eastern Uusimaa. The biggest contiguous deteriorating area is in 
Hattula. 
<H5>  Researcher Got Frightened </H5>
  Juhonsalo has thousands of measurements to back up his 
claims, but until now no one has believed him. Now Olavi Laiho, 
the METLA (Forest Research Institute) Parkano Research Station 
chief, has become frightened by his own observations and 
Juhonsalo's claims to the degree that he is suggesting the 
institute research the phenomenon. 
  METLA has studied the changes in tree growth rates since the 
1920's. It has not detected a significant reduction, in fact it 
has detected the contrary. But METLA measures the thickness of 
the trunk. 
  "There is only one true answer to this question: Either the 
trees are growing or they are not," confirms Juhonsalo. He 
trusts in his meter stick. "METLA must not have one, since they 
are unable to measure height growth." 
  METLA has a tape measure too. In an exception to the usual, 
METLA measured tbe heights of 161 trees between 1980 and 1991. 
These trees had grown better than the ones Juhonsalo measured, 
but their growth, too, has slowed down. 
  Juhonsalo has measured the height growth of at least 1,000 
spruce trees every summer since 1985, often of even 2,000 
spruce. The growth has decreased each year except in 1991, when 
it recovered and was almost one-half of the standard year's 
growth. During the following year, the growth relapsed clearly 
again. Last summer the remnant was only 27 percent of the growth 
during 1985, the standard-setting year. 
  "How could the trees grow when a big part of the needles 
have 
been shed and those that remain are sick," bemoans Juhonsalo. 
<H5>  Zealous and Bold </H5>
  Olavi Laiho knows about Juhonsalo and his measurements. 
"Juhonsalo is skillful and talented, a man at least equal to the 
professor level in his native intelligence. You cannot ignore 
his measurements. He knows how to measure alright." 
  Laiho himself is a cautious and conscientous researcher. No 
errors have been found in his work, and he has not exaggerated. 
  Juhonsalo is not cautious. He is straight-talking, zealous, 
and even a little mean. When he gets excited, he lists a lot of 
politicians and researchers and then calls for the enemy of 
souls with all of his names. 
  According to METLA inventories, there is plenty of wood in 
the forests. All of it cannot even be used. METLA has found a 
lot of cause to criticize the reliability of Juhonsalo's 
measurements. 
  "If I am right, there is not enough wood even for the new 
mill in Rauma. The inventory of wood reserves has been done 
wrong, and even what does actually exist is being destroyed 
fast, but people do not notice anything. How can Minister of 
Agriculture and Forestry Pura travel from Tammela to Helsinki 
without seeing all the dying trees?" 
<H5>  Trees Remain Dwarfed </H5>
  According to Juhonsalo, the growth rate of the trees has 
plunged rapidly. If this trend continues a tree that is 12 cm 
thick will not grow to 17 cm in thickness in its lifetime, nor 
will a tree 2.5 meters tall ever grow to be even 6 meters tall. 
  Juhonsalo is frustrated when the politicians will not take 
his observations seriously. There is no desire to even discuss 
them, and what is worse, doubting researchers try to prove them 
wrong. 
  The forests really are deteriorating so rapidly that one 
will 
be able to soon determine proof of their poor condition even 
without a measuring tape. Juhonsalo has marked yellowed trees 
with colored ribbon. It has taken at most two years for the bark 
to come loose and for the tree to die. It has happened that a 
healthy-looking tree has died in just a few weeks. 
  Juhontalo has felled all of the trees that have dried up 
standing, the snags, in his own and a neighbor's forest plot. 
One year later he has found more dead spruce trees in the same 
places. 
  "It was never like this before. I have tramped through 
Finnish forests for almost 50 years so I am qualified to say 
that."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forest Service Did Not Commence </F>
Riuskanselkonen Forest Harvest"] 
  [Text] Suomussalmi -- The Forest Service and the forest 
activists of the Nature Alliance are finding themselves in 
confrontation over the planned harvests in the Riuskanselkonen 
area of Suomussalmi in Kainuu. The Forest Service will not, 
after all, begin harvesting on Monday [10 January]. 
  About 20 of the Nature Alliance activists went cross-country 
skiing in the area as they pondered possible future actions. 
This forest activist group is demanding that the area be closed 
to all operations and is prepared to interrupt the 
Riuskanselkonen harvest with various methods. 
  In the opinion of the Nature Alliance, the Riuskanselkonen 
area still is, despite the harvests that have already been 
carried out, a significant wetland and forest entity in the 
Kainuu environment. The 6,500-hectare region contains two 
wetland protection zones. The harvests were planned for two 
areas which have been marked for cutting. The project would have 
employed 40 loggers and contractors.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Peter Eyerer, head, Institute for </F>
Plastics Testing and Plastics Science (IKP), Stuttgart, under 
the rubric "Production": "IKP Head Professor Peter Eyerer: 
'One-Sided Mentalities Are Not Suited for Solving Complex 
Environmental Problems'. The Ecobalance Is Becoming a 
Decision-Making Tool"; first paragraph is VDI NACHRICHTEN's 
introduction] 
  [Text] Stuttgart, 7 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--"Avoid Using and 
Disposing Of" goes a well known motto of the German 
environmentalists on the way toward the recycling economy. The 
recycling of materials is accordingly a duty. But Professor 
Peter Eyerer, a doctor of engineering, wonders whether the devil 
is not being cast out by Beelzebub here. Together with his team 
of experts at the Institute for Plastics Testing and Plastics 
Science (IKP) in Stuttgart, in what follows he advocates the 
trend that has begun toward comprehensive balancing of the 
environmental impact of products. 
  The recycling of used materials into the production cycle is 
certainly a sensible move toward reducing the quantities of 
waste that accrue. But if the logistical expense to be incurred 
or the energy requirement for returning materials to the 
materials cycle go beyond a justifiable level, the 
reasonableness of such a course of action has to be examined. 
This applies likewise to recycling procedures or processes whose 
consumption of energy and emissions are higher than those of the 
primary process of producing the material. 
  Every individual angle has to be weighed here. For this 
reason a suitable aid has to be developed in order to make 
transparent and to categorize the individual benefits or 
burdens: The ecobalance will become a decision-making tool. For 
it will be possible to arrive at a judgement only by the 
complete consideration of every relevant aspect, i.e., the 
technical, economic and ecological viewpoints, and not just from 
a single-cause viewpoint. 
  But the ecobalance cannot be a sole aid as an assessment 
method for environmental aspects. Though it is excellently 
suited for showing the appropriateness of individual process 
options, nevertheless it fails when it is a matter of 
considering the overall model taking economic and technical 
criteria into account. 
  For instance, plastics recycling is today largely well 
masterable technically and sensible when true-to-type clean 
waste whose composition is known is at hand. But problems arise 
when economic limiting conditions, like the recyclate's price 
compared to the new product, for example, speak against the use 
of recycled materials. For instance, today 1 kg of polyethylene 
(PE) from East European countries costs around one German mark 
[DM]. The comparable product from West Europe is quoted at 
almost DM1.10 per kilogram. And by contrast polyethylene from 
recycled material costs about DM2.5 per kilogram today. Is it 
sensible all the same to recycle popular plastics like 
polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene? Certainly not at all from an 
economic standpoint! But the material is indeed too good to 
throw away, and also too expensive at today's dumping costs. But 
the consumers or, as the case may be, buyers of plastics users 
are not willing to fall back on secondary products. Technical 
specifications are often even worded so that the use of 
secondary raw materials is not even possible. Of course, with 
that a sales market at the going price anyway also needs to be 
able to be obtained. Thermal recycling presents itself, 
especially for popular plastics like PE and PP. Instead of 
burning petroleum in the form of heating oil, petroleum in the 
form of plastics can be burned just as well, only with the 
difference that here still another mission would be fulfilled as 
well in the meantime. 
  But thermal processes are still encountering rejection 
because of the strong feeling of insecurity among the public. 
This debate is based for the most part on a large deficiency of 
information that is attributable on the one hand to the lack of 
education by operators, but on the other hand also to strongly 
politically motivated opinion molding. Factual arguments are 
often too weak in this subject area to get around the 
emotionalizing of the groups concerned. 
  Hence comes the need basically to compare all waste disposal 
and recycling technologies and to examine the suitability of the 
individual processes for the most different waste products or 
old components that accrue. Transparency for operators and the 
public has to be provided precisely here by way of an 
all-embracing consideration of every aspect. Accordingly, an 
ecobalance that describes just environmental aspects is not an 
adequate tool. Rather, the system description has to come after 
a comprehensive way of viewing the question. 
  For example, for metals there has been recycling for 
decades, 
motivated by economic factors. However, very often there has 
been no direct recycling (closed-loop recycling) for a 
particular use, but the recycling of materials in other fields 
of use (open-loop recycling). 
  However, there have been strong efforts to recycle for the 
same use scrap that accrues from primary uses. Far greater 
success has been achieved here for metallic materials than for 
polymer materials. But is this effort also really sensible? Why 
does high-grade steel absolutely have to be remade into 
high-grade steel? When there is a market for less exacting uses, 
one has to consider well what expense matches which results. 
  The problem for metals, of amassing individual particular 
alloys separately and true to type, is similar to that for 
plastics. Proportionate expense has to be incurred here too in 
order to achieve closed-loop recycling. 
  As are plastics, metals are also used mostly in composite 
designs and less frequently in pure form. On the one hand it is 
precisely these uses that result in special problems for 
recycling, but on the other hand it is also these uses that are 
distinguished by exceptional property profiles. 
  But worth the real attention here is the question whether 
the 
closed- loop recycling of metallic materials for a particular 
use is sensible as a principle. A worldwide market for secondary 
uses, i.e., uses having lower requirements for the materials, 
has developed over the course of time for metals. The decisive 
problem to be solved is whether the introduction of the material 
into a recycling cascade or, as the case may be, the approving 
acceptance of a putative material assessment generally 
represents a worse solution. 
  The answer to this question can be given again only by 
considering every important influencing factor from ecology, 
economics and technology. The comprehensive balance will become 
the valuable aid toward getting a more complete picture of the 
situation. 
  One-sided and single-cause mentalities are not suited for 
solving complex circumstances like the problems of recycling. 
Firm solution possibilities will be found only via a 
comprehensive way of viewing the question that includes economic 
aspects too in addition to the technical and ecological aspects. 
Comprehensive balances by way of ecobalances expanded in 
important aspects are such a tool. This decision-making tool 
must be applied separately for company-, product- and 
site-specific aspects. In addition, the entire product life 
cycle must be considered. Sound materials and process decisions 
can be made only on this basis. 
  In addition to optimization in the purely materials area, 
however, work also has to be done on a resource-minimized 
product cycle for components already at the design stage. In 
addition to the avoidance of non- disassembly-friendly designs, 
the use of specific combinations of materials in composite 
components and the general selection from the diversity of 
materials has to be thought over, both for polymer materials and 
for metals. 
  The advantages and disadvantages of individual options must 
be submitted to a comprehensive balance already at this early 
stage of product development, in order to be able to reveal 
weaknesses in good time or to make sound selection decisions. 
For this reason the comprehensive balance takes on central 
importance as a tool in the development process and in 
simultaneous engineering.

<F P=106> [Report by Roland Bunzenthal: "Researchers Call For Change </F>
of Policy for Climate Protection"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 2 Mar -- The reduction of carbon 
dioxide emissions, which is essential for the protection of the 
climate, cannot be achieved on the basis of the current energy 
policy. This conclusion was published by the German Institute 
for Economic Research (DIW) in its recent weekly report. The 
Federal Government's objectives for fighting the greenhouse 
effect can only be achieved through a "comprehensive bunch of 
measures," particularly a "sizable" increase in the price of 
fossil energy through higher taxes and rates. After all, by 
taking inflation into account, the current prices of some energy 
sources are hardly higher than 20 years ago. 
  It is Bonn's declared objective to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions in Germany between 25 and 30 percent by the year 2005 
-- in relation to 1987. The DIW estimates that approximately 
721 million tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted in western 
Germany in 1993, which even constitutes a slight increase over 
1987. In eastern Germany, however, emissions have been halved 
since then and are now at a level of about 170 million tonnes -- 
mainly as a result of the "economic slump there." 
  The DIW criticizes that the "Federal Government's ambitious 
objective" is inconsistent with "the activities it initiated." 
While the government announced a considerably stricter 
insulation regulation, it finally "only adopted a much weaker 
version of it." What is missing is "a comprehensive promotion by 
the state" of "measures for the economical use of energy" and a 
policy of "avoiding transport and shifting transport to systems 
that are more energy-efficient." 
  In addition, the DIW complains, the Federal Government is 
not 
ready to become active at a national level in anticipation of a 
European carbon dioxide/energy tax. This would result in 
competitive disadvantages in the short term but prevent "a major 
adaption shock in the future."

  [Text] The parliamentary SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] party has called on the Federal Government in a 
parliamentary motion to present a comprehensive dioxin reduction 
program to bring together and standardize the laender's dioxin 
measurement programs for establishing permissible emission and 
concentration levels. The data obtained from the measurements 
should be stored in a dioxin database and made public. 
Mandatory limits based on the principle of prevention should be 
laid down as rapidly as possible for the main sources of 
emission, says the SPD. The dioxin sources where dioxins and 
furans occur as undesirable by-products should be "stopped up." 
The deputies thus recommend a schedule for phasing out the use 
of hexachloroethane in the aluminum industry, close compounds 
involving chloric paints, lacquers, oils, and lubricants in the 
metal industry, chloric cooling lubricants and cleaning agents 
in metal working, and halogenated organic coatings such as PVC 
[polyvinyl chloride] or chloric materials for chipboard and wood 
products. Products containing halogenated organic compounds 
should be labeled accordingly, states the motion, which also 
calls for dioxin to be banned from recycling. 
  The call above all is for a ban on close compounds 
containing 
chloric materials in the automobile industry, for instance PVC 
underseals, and in cable sheaths. Dioxin concentration limits 
should be laid down for agricultural and horticultural areas so 
as to avoid it being transferred to human beings via animal and 
vegetable foods. At the European level, the Federal Government 
should press for this dioxin modification program to be made 
binding throughout the European Union.

  [Text] Bonn/Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer has rejected criticism from the environmental 
organization Greenpeace in connection with the export of 480 
tonnes of pesticide toxic waste to Albania. There is "nothing 
to hide" in this matter, Toepfer said today in Bonn. The 
Hanover firm of Schmidt-Cretan has exported pesticides from the 
former GDR to Albania as "humanitarian aid" from 1991 to 1992. 
  Greenpeace accused the Environment Ministry of "hindering 
the 
due process of law." An experts' report last year spoke of an 
"explosive risk situation" and recommended that the German 
Government see to the "immediate securing" of the toxic waste 
freight. Neither the German criminal investigation authorities 
nor the Albanian authorities were given access to the report. 
  Toepfer said that the Lower Saxony criminal investigation 
office and the Federal Criminal Investigation Bureau has been 
informed about the report by phone. Experts from the German 
Technical Support Service established in situ in Albania that 
there is no immediate danger to the environment. Moreover, the 
export is legal. However, efforts are to be made to find a 
"national solution." 
  Greenpeace expert Andreas Bernstorff said that the toxic 
substances are a danger to the population. If Toepfer wants a 
national solution, he will have to bring the toxic freight back 
to Germany as quickly as possible to dispose of it here. 
Greenpeace has itself secured the greater part of the toxic 
waste against the risk of explosion and leakage. Moreover, it 
organized the return transport of around 1,000 kg of the 
pesticides. The truck will arrive in Germany in the next few 
days. Further return transport is not planned, however, 
contrary to other statements made by Greenpeace staff.

<F P=106> [Article by Angelika Jung-Huettl: "New Problems With a </F>
Polluted Site -- The Reclamation of the GDR [German Democratic 
Republic]'s Former Uranium Mining Area Could Endanger a Million 
People's Drinking Water: A Delicate Problem"] 
  [Text] The GDR was once the third-largest producer of 
uranium in the world, surpassed only by the United States and 
Canada. As a result, an area half the size of the Saarland has 
been left devastated. Radioactivity from the former pits in the 
ore mining area in Saxony and Thuringia is posing a massive 
threat to drinking water supplies in eastern Germany. 
  Let us take Koenigstein, for example. Wismut GmbH mining 
specialists and engineers believe that the uranium, which is 
readily soluble, would have to be "flushed out" of the rock 
before the Koenigstein mine, which is situated in the Elbe 
sandstone range, is closed down and flooded. This, they say, 
would be the only way to prevent radioactive substances from 
finding their way into the environment in the distant future. 
However, Saxony's Environment Ministry in Dresden, which has to 
license reclamation methods, fears that this in itself could 
contaminate a major groundwater stratum from which a million 
people in the Dresden and Pirna area draw their drinking water. 
  What is going on in the pit whose closure could have a 
serious impact on the population's living standards? 
Koenigstein is one of the four mines from which the Wismut 
Soviet-German Joint-Stock Corporation (SDAG) extracted uranium 
for decades without regard to the damage inflicted on the 
environment and the health hazards to which it exposed the 
population. Processing plants then turned it into "yellow 
cake," the raw material for the fuel elements used in east 
German and Soviet nuclear power stations and Moscow's atom bomb 
industry after the war. 
  The Federal Trade and Federal Environment ministries 
discontinued uranium mining after the unification of Germany on 
grounds of unprofitability. The SDAG was converted from a 
mining and production corporation into a reclamation firm, 
Wismut GmbH, and is now responsible for freeing the uranium 
mining area of "pollutants, soil, waterway, and air 
contamination, and other environmental hazards present on the 
operating site and in the real estate pertaining thereto." 
  "Actually, Koenigstein is just a small part of this 
comprehensive eco-repair operation, albeit a particularly 
delicate one," says Stephanie Hurst of Saxony's Environment 
Ministry in Dresden. Indeed, in order to dissolve the uranium 
out of the rock, the SDAG, in its day, had forced hundreds of 
thousands of cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid 300 meters 
down into the uranium-bearing seam, which is about 20 meters 
thick. In order to increase the working surface for the acid 
solution, the rock was divided and blasted into blocks measuring 
about 80 by 80 meters by a height of -- depending on the uranium 
content and the characteristics of the rock -- 5 to 20 meters 
prior to "leaching," as mining specialists call this method of 
mining. "Pillars" were inserted between the blocks to support 
the "pits." The liquor containing the uranium was collected by 
a drainage system and pumped to the surface, where the uranium 
was extracted. 
  There were 750,000 cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid 
circulating between the leaching zone and the processing plant. 
There are currently about 1 million cubic meters of leaching 
fluid in the pores and crevices of the whole mined area of the 
Koenigstein pit, where it is still producing its effect. 
  The people in charge at Wismut intend to flood Koenigstein 
as 
well, like most closed mines. This means switching off the 
high-power pumps that keep the underground shafts and tunnels 
free of water seeping in from the neighboring rock. The mine 
then "drowns," as the mining specialists put it. 
  Flooding the Koenigstein pit will entail hazards that cannot 
yet be assessed, as the groundwater bearing stratum that 
provides Dresden and Pirna with their drinking water is only 
just above the stratum from which the miners have extracted 
uranium. It is true that the water bearing stratum is separated 
from the mined cavities by a 20-meter thick, water-retaining, 
argilliferous sandstone stratum. However, the flood water from 
the mine, which would be contaminated with radionuclides and 
other pollutants, could find its way into the drinking water and 
contaminate it either via the mine shafts and bores or via 
naturally occurring crevices and faults in the rock. 
  "An increase in the quantity of radioactive substances in 
the 
drinking and household water means a rise in the cancer and 
leukemia risk to the population," warns Munich radiobiologist 
Edmund Lengfelder, who is studying the impact of uranium mining 
in Saxony and Thuringia on health. This hazard would be reduced 
by keeping the mine "open." "But that would cost us 15 to 20 
million German marks a year," explains Rudolf Daenecke, who is 
in charge of the reclamation work at Wismut GmbH. This is what 
the electricity to power the pumps and technical measures, such 
as ventilating the underground cavities, would cost. 
  First of all, Wismut GmbH did something that provoked 
accusations of fraud: After the cessation of mining work as of 
1 January 1991, it blasted a number of blocks of stone in the 
mine, which it intends to leach using the previous mining method 
to flush out the pollutants. The uranium will even be processed 
into yellow cake and sold through EURATOM [European Atomic 
Energy Community]. Wismut claims that the profit will be spent 
on the reclamation project.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Buerke: "Light Purifies Water -- </F>
UV-Lamps Can Be an Alternative to Chlorine -- Pilot Plant 
Planned Near Bonn"] 
  [Text] Mankind has been able to control a number of 
epidemic diseases, such as cholera, by disinfecting drinking 
water. Chlorine has been the main agent used for this purpose 
for about 100 years. In the more recent past, however, 
scientists have acknowledged that these additives also give rise 
to the formation of a number of harmful by-products, such as 
chloroform. This was why the Federal Research Minister set up a 
joint research product six years ago to examine the feasibility 
of using ultraviolet light to disinfect drinking water, for 
which it provided total funding in excess of 6 million German 
marks. Not long ago, the multidisciplinary research team 
demonstrated that plants of this type can be built on an 
industrial scale as well. 
  Actually, there have been UV disinfecting plants since the 
beginning of the century, though only for fairly small 
throughputs and primarily for use with well or spring water, 
which is relatively untainted. The multiyear studies set out to 
create the technical prerequisites for an industrial-scale plant 
capable of purifying large volumes of water from lakes and 
reservoirs, where the main problem is biological contamination 
caused by plankton, which constitutes organic matter that 
subsequently reacts with chlorine to form harmful substances. 
  The test system was built by scientists at the Max Planck 
Institute of Radiation Chemistry in Muelheim. It basically 
comprises a UV lamp similar in shape and size to a neon tube, 
which is inserted into a stainless steel pipe. The water flows 
through the space between the lamp and the inner wall of the 
pipe, where it is exposed to UV radiation. 
  The researchers optimized their plant over long series of 
tests until it was possible to kill off sufficient quantities of 
the main bacteria and viruses. An important condition for 
success in this respect is that all the water in the flow pipe 
must be evenly exposed to uniform radiation. Moreover, 
researchers from the Free University of Berlin Hygiene Institute 
have also established that no substances that could have a 
mutagenic effect on human beings occur in UV-treated water. 
  Nevertheless, technical limitations also emerged. For 
example, if the water has too high an iron or manganese content, 
radiation precipitates these elements, which then form a thin 
film on the glass wall of the lamp. In extreme cases this 
halves the intensity of the radiation after only 500 operating 
hours. Care is also needed when treating water with a high 
nitrate content, as toxic nitrite can be formed. However, this 
problem can be avoided by using a special UV lamp in such cases. 
  A general drawback is that -- unlike the procedure used with 
chemical additives -- the water is, of course, not further 
disinfected in the mains after radiation, so it is possible that 
germs may reform there. It still has to be established whether 
recontamination of this type occurs or not. 
  Be that as it may, in certain conditions the UV method 
constitutes an alternative to chemical disinfection. A pilot 
plant will thus be set up at the Wahnbach reservoir, whose 
waters supply about three-quarters of a million people in the 
Bonn area with drinking water.

<F P=106> [Article by Bart Stam: "New Process for Artificial </F>
Fossilization Attacks Manure Problem"] 
  [Text] Eindhoven -- Accelerated artificial fossilization is 
a technique which tackles the problem of surplus animal dung. 
The method is a combination of compression, electromagnetic 
radiation, and thermal dissection. The owner of the process, 
Pieke Beheer in Eindhoven, is presently trying to find 
interested parties for an installation which can turn an annual 
60,000 tonnes of chicken feces into a carboniferous end product. 
  Artificial fossilization speeds up the conversion of organic 
materials into carbon, oil and gas. This conversion process can 
achieve in about an hour and a half what nature does in millions 
of years. This is achieved through a combination of existing 
techniques which have never been combined before. Pieke Beheer 
has patents for its process in Europe, Japan and the United 
States. 
<H5>  Homogeneous </H5>
  One of Pieke Beheer's employees, engineer R. Eggink, worked 
together with the late W.J.H. Schippers on the development of 
the fossilization process. He believes that the procedure and 
the accompanying three-stage reactor can convert all organic 
materials into "Pieke Black", the patented name of the resulting 
carboniferous end product. "The best results are obtained with a 
homogeneous material such as chicken feces," according to Eggink. 
  In a first stage, research was focused on the conversion of 
domestic waste. But because domestic waste consists of 
extremely varied components, preference was given to organic 
materials such as semi-liquid manure. The University of 
Amsterdam researched the conversion of chicken feces into Pieke 
Black. "The results were encouraging," says Eggink. From the 
various research projects it became apparent that the manure 
must have a dried consistency of at least 45 percent. 
  In the Pieke process, the first stage is compression. A 
special press reduces the feces into vacuum blocks under high 
pressure (280 kilograms per square centimeter). During the 
second stage, an industrial microwave triggers off a biochemical 
reaction which is needed to start the disintegration process of 
the feces by means of bacteria. The blocks are sent in a 
continuous line through the tunnel-shaped microwave, and are 
exposed to microwaves at three points. In the microwave, the 
temperature rises to about 70 or 80 degrees Celsius. The 
evaporating moisture is sucked out and condensed. 
  The third and last stage is the thermal dissection 
(gasification) of the feces. Before the organic material enters 
the reactor, it is crumbled into small pieces. The temperature 
of the reactor is first raised to 250 degrees, whereby a large 
part of the moisture evaporates. Then the dung is gasified at 
480 degrees maximum. Any inorganic material in the feces is 
separated and collected into a special tube. The released gases 
are suitable for two applications; the production of 
electricity, or separation into oil and gas by means of 
condensation. 
  Finally, following cooling (during which the temperature 
drops again to 20 degrees) the desired end product, Pieke Black, 
is obtained. Eggink says: "Tests have shown that our product is 
very suitable as a filling material in rubbers and various 
polymers." 
<H5>  No Orders Yet </H5>
  It seems, according to Eggink's own feasibility study, that 
an installation with a capacity to treat 60,000 tons of chicken 
feces annually, divided over two production lines, has the best 
chance of success both technically and commercially. Such an 
installation would produce 20,000 tons of Pieke Black, with a 
value of 1,250 Netherlands guilders per tonne. The conversion 
costs are 850 guilders per tonne. According to Eggink, the 
energy balance of the procedure is also promising, in that the 
installation produces more energy than it consumes, although 
there are considerable internal differences for the applications 
mentioned. "The combination of our process with the dehydration 
of waste material gives a higher total yield than when 
electricity is produced with the remaining gases." 
  According to Eggink, various authorities in Western Europe 
have shown interest in the Pieke Beheer process, though no 
orders have yet been placed. He is very confident, however, 
that orders will come: "Artificial fossilization is a valuable 
alternative to the present animal waste conversion 
installations."

<F P=106> [Christine McGourty report: "Windscale Safety Below </F>
Standard"] 
  [Text] Serious clean-up problems remain at the Windscale 
nuclear reactor at Sellafield 37 years after the fire there, 
according to a report yesterday by the Health and Safety 
Commission. 
  "A very long programme of work" was needed to make the two 
reactors at the site safe, said the commission's Advisory 
Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installation (ACSNI). 
  The report described the state of the reactors as generally 
unsatisfactory. 
  "At present they fall far below the `as safe as reasonably 
achievable' criterion," it said. Great care would be needed to 
ensure no radioactivity was released from the reactors to the 
environment during the rest of the clean-up programme. 
  After the 1957 nuclear accident -- one of the world's worst 
-- undamaged nuclear fuel was discharged from Pile One, the 
military reactor where it occurred. 
  But the possibility of another fire still exists since 15 
tons of damaged fuel remain in the core, a further five tons in 
the water and air ducts and the graphite core of the second 
reactor -- known as Pile Two -- still stores vast amounts of 
energy. 
  Mr. Eddie Varney, acting chief inspector of the Nuclear 
Installations Inspectorate, said it had been dissatisfied with 
the progress of safety work and had been forced to serve 
improvement notices on the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), which 
is responsible for the site, in 1992, to speed it up. 
  "What was worrying us was that the piles were connected 
through the stacks to the atmosphere," said Mr. Varney. "We 
wanted air to circulate through so you could look for a fire. 
The authority had proposed this but was taking too long to do 
it." 
  An improved ventilation system has since been installed at 
Pile One, reducing the possibility of a radioactive discharge, 
the AEA said yesterday. 
  It said work was underway to remove loose fuel from air and 
water ducts and improve fire detection and suppression systems. 
  ACSNI also criticised storage facilities for nuclear waste 
at 
AEA's Dounreay site. The site has been host to research into a 
new type of reactor but following the withdrawal of Government 
funding, the prototype fast reactor (PFR) is due for closure 
next month. 
  The Dounreay fast reactor (DFR) that was used to test fuel 
for the prototype has already been closed down and 
decommissioning is underway. But ACSNI said the site was "not 
well provided with waste storage capacity. 
  "As with the DFR breeder fuel, there are no reprocessing or 
disposal routes identified as yet for the PFR breeder."

<F P=106> [Article by Punta Arenas correspondent Pilar Espinosa Ribas] </F>
  [Text] Antarctic Flotilla Commodore Jaime Urdangarin Romero 
on 11 February reported that the first international meeting of 
commanders of Antarctic bases in the South Shetland Islands was 
held at President Frei Base. The meeting's purpose was to reach 
an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea 
pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks. 
  Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, 
Brazil, 
Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the 
meeting committed themselves to asking their respective 
governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested 
by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action 
program at their next meeting. 
  Commodore Urdangarin stated: "All the participants 
acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways 
and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic 
way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure 
in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the 
Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison." 
  He underscored that this initiative was materialized by 
Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who 
had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the 
increase in sea traffic. 
  On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations 
in 
the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to 
appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations 
coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the 
area. 
  At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels, 
equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well 
as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 3 February to 17 March. 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  Accra GHANAIAN TIMES in English reports in its 3 February 
edition that "The Ministry of Environment and the Greater Accra 
regional administration" on 2 February "ordered the stone 
breakers of Achimota Forest area near Accra to cease their 
operations within 24 hours or face prosecution." This order 
follows a previous one issued in May asking the stone breakers 
to move from the area by October and to go to another site at 
Pokuase but the order was not complied with. Environment 
Minister Christine Amoako-Nuamah, who gave the order, said the 
Achimota Forest stone breakers' activities were "causing a 
serious environmental problem to the people living around the 
Achimota and Legon areas." 
  Accra DAILY GRAPHIC in English reports in its 9 February 
edition that, according to studies conducted by the University 
of Science and Technology, the River Subin, which flows through 
Kumasi and its environs, is "almost dead." "High levels of 
environmental pollution and irresponsible management practices 
by the Kumasi Metropolitan Authority and communities along the 
river" threaten the Subin as well as the Kentikrono, Wewe, 
Susan, and Aboabo Rivers. Mrs. Esi Awuah, environmental 
biologist at the university, says the oxygen levels in these 
rivers are depleting to such an extent that they are "gradually 
losing their ability to contain higher forms of life." Mrs. 
Awuah stated most industries near Atonsu, where the rivers join 
together in a valley, "do not have waste treatment plants and 
poison control units" and therefore discharge "untreated 
chemicals of a toxic nature" into the confluence. The 
communities along the river have long practiced the "dumping of 
night soil" and some have even constructed "places of 
convenience" directly over the water. Her research has shown 
that the Subin could restore itself in 32 days "if proper 
environmental and sanitary measures are adopted." 
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 1300 GMT on 3 March reports that the program officer of the 
Environmental Protection Council, Mr. K. O. Omare, has cautioned 
that if proper controls and incentive mechanisms are not put in 
place for industrial development in Ghana, "environmental 
pollution would assume alarming proportions in the near future." 
He said efforts so far made toward control or prevention of the 
adverse effects of industry have been "largely inadequate." Mr. 
Omare gave the warning at a symposium organized to mark 
Environmental Day at the Buy Ghana-Export Ghana '94 Fair in 
Accra. Our reporter, who was present at the symposium, adds 
that there is a "growing concern in the country about industrial 
waste and pollution, health and safety hazards to workers, and 
public health problems due to adverse environmental changes and 
the misapplication of hazardous chemicals." A UN Industrial 
Development Organization study carried out in 1984 on industrial 
pollution reported that for the zone between Cote d'Ivoire and 
Benin, including Ghana, industrial pollutants are produced 
mainly by the textile industry, whose waste contains 30 percent 
of four polluting substances. Manufacturers of food products 
contribute 25 percent, while petroleum refining and handling 
produce 20 percent of industrial waste. Mineral exploitation 
and processing are also responsible for about 10 percent of the 
waste. 
<H5>  Guinea </H5>
  Conakry Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique de Guinea 
in French at 0645 GMT on 17 March reports that at its recent 
session the Council of Ministers decided to stop deforestation 
and stressed "the need to preserve forest resources as well as 
state land reserves." It adds that at a time when environmental 
protection organizations are warning against global warming and 
stressing the need to preserve trees and forests, Guineans 
irresponsibly set the country's forests and vegetation on fire. 
By doing so they leave "the countryside to the mercy of sand, 
wind, and erosion, in short, desert encroachment." The 
government has launched a campaign to save these forests and 
protect the nation's interests. Therefore, as far as the Koukou 
forest in Kindia is concerned the 1949 demarcation will be 
respected. People living in the area will be evacuated before 
30 March and all land allocations and occupation made within the 
limits of nonprotected zones and state lands reserves have been 
declared null and void in all prefectures. As President Lansana 
Conte recently said: We must preserve our riches. The forest is 
the source of our great wealth. 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 1 
March 
reports that the Edo State administrator, Lieutenant Colonel 
Muhammed Onuka, has undertaken an inspection tour of the 
erosion- ravaged areas of Benin-City. At the Iwaseta-Orin road 
square, the administrator said that if the flood in the area was 
controlled, the road could serve as a by-pass to the state 
capital. Col. Onuka directed the state environment task force 
to produce a comprehensive report on the erosion-devastated 
areas of the state for necessary action. 
<H5>  Tanzania </H5>
  Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania External Service in English at 
1600 GMT on 15 March reports the government plans "to carry out 
a study to determine the number of hotels that can be built in 
the national parks without threatening wild game and the 
environment." The prime minister and first vice president, John 
Malecela, told the president of the International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature, IUCN, Mr. J. Hare, that the study would 
cover all the national parks. The prime minister said Tanzania 
"would welcome foreign assistance in carrying out the study" and 
the IUCN showed interest in assisting in the study. 
  Honorable Malecela said poaching was a very serious problem 
in the national parks as poachers were using increasingly 
sophisticated weapons. He said the poachers, mostly from 
war-torn Somalia, were using machine guns and were very ruthless 
in their methods. He said Tanzania was forced to use its 
limited resources to deal with this problem. The prime minister 
said drought in northern Tanzania had seriously affected wild 
animals and thousands had died. Mr. Hare said the IUCN would 
open an office in Dar es Salaam.

  [Text] Changchun, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Shoals of fish have 
returned to the Songhua River in Jilin Province, where the water 
turned black and aquatic products died out two decades ago due 
to heavy pollution. 
  "This is the result of local governments' efforts to protect 
the water resources," said Wang Yongrong, chairman of the 
Songhua and Liaohe River Valley Water Conservancy Committee 
under the Ministry of Water Resources. 
  "Progress has been made in protecting the water resources of 
the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers, one of China's seven key water 
systems, alongside the rapid economic development," the chairman 
noted. 
  China's water resource volume ranks sixth in the world. 
However, average consumption per capita in China is only 
one-fourth the world's average, falling in 88th place. 
  Northeast China, where the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers flow, 
suffers severe shortages of water resources. The average per 
capita consumption of the surface water is only one-half the 
country's average. 
  Northeast China consists of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning 
Provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  To clean up the pollution and protect the water resources, 
the central government set up a leading group in charge of the 
protection of the Songhua River in 1978. 
  In 1987, the group was expanded from members from 
Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces and six ministries to include 
representatives from northeast China's provinces and one 
autonomous region and 12 ministries and commissions under the 
central government, and its jurisdiction was enlarged to cover 
both the Songhua and the Liaohe Rivers. 
  Years of practice have proven such a trans-regional leading 
organization is effective in cleaning up and controlling 
pollution and protecting the water resources. 
  A survey shows that the group has ordered 173 enterprises in 
the Songhua and Liaohe River valley to clean up and control 
pollution, involving a sum of 560 million yuan. 
  By the end of last year, these enterprises had completed 200 
projects. 
  These projects are able to treat 309 million tons of waste 
water and reduce the discharge of 650,000 tons of pollutants a 
year into river. They earn 130 million yuan a year through 
recycling and re- using treated water. 
  While helping enterprises in the Songhua and Liaoning [as 
received] River valley to upgrade their technology to cut the 
discharge of mercury into the rivers, the central government and 
Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial governments have allocated 
special funds to make an epidemiological investigation before 
working out related regulations and measures to protect the 
rivers. 
  According to the regulations, any organization or enterprise 
that violates the set limit for discharging waste water into the 
rivers will be fined. 
  In addition, cities are encouraged to improve their 
environment and make recycled use of treated waste water. 
  Liaoning, China's key industrial province, has launched a 
"water cleaning project" to protect the water resources, improve 
the water environment and save industrial-use water. 
  Governments of Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces 
and 
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are taking joint efforts to 
monitor the water quality of the Songhua and Liaohe Rivers in 
winter, when water quality tends to deteriorate. 
  They also are carrying out international cooperation and 
exchange in this field. 
  Officials and experts in environmental protection of 
northeast China have paid a visit to Japan to learn from the 
latest achievement and technology in the study and treatment of 
mercury, and extended cooperation with the United States in 
treating organic pollution. 
  They are also striving to gain international cooperation and 
donations for environmental protection. 
  Yan Keqiang, deputy minister of water resources, has 
encouraged people in northeast China to continue their efforts 
to protect the water resources by saying, "we are determined to 
harness and protect the Songhua and Liaohe River system and all 
other major river systems in China."

  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The people in China 
have planted a total of 18 billion trees since the early 1950's, 
and the man-made afforested area amounts to 33 million ha, 
making it the world leader in this respect, according to the 
"CHINA ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL". 
  Obvious progress has been made in developing the 6.7-million 
ha fast-growing tree base, the northern China shelter belt, and 
the tree belts around the farmlands in the plains areas, on the 
middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River, along the 
coastal areas, in the Taihang Mountains and in arid areas. 
  The professional paper noted that Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hunan 
Provinces have taken the lead in covering their barren mountains 
with trees. 
  The forestry departments, of which the gross output value 
rose from 2.52 billion yuan in 1952 to 140 billion yuan last 
year, offered several billion cu m of timber for national 
economic development, and expanded the afforested areas by more 
than 133 million ha. 
  According to Xu Youfang, minister of forestry, China will 
raise its tree coverage rate from the present 13.92 percent to 
15.3 percent in 1995 and that of cities to 25 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- China's environmental 
quality has remained basically unchanged in recent years, though 
environmental problems has posed a serious challenge to the 
country, a senior Chinese environmental official said here today. 
  At a press conference given by the current session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC), Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC 
Environmental Protection Committee, said that the country's 
environmental quality has "basically remained at the same level 
of the 1980's." 
  He said that economic losses caused by environmental 
pollution in China top about 100 billion yuan every year. 
  Asked about Chinese Government's spendings on environment, 
he 
said that China spends 20 billion yuan on environment protection 
every year, accounting for 0.7 percent of its annual gross 
national product. The figure leads all other developing 
countries in the world, he said. 
  He cited the example of Beijing city, which spends an amount 
of money that accounts for 2.4 percent of its annual gross 
domestic product every year. In the past decade, the city has 
spent over ten billion yuan on projects for curbing pollutions. 
  He noted that the government imposes very low fines on 
enterprises which violate environmental protection rules, 
prompting some enterprises to pay fines in exchange for 
government consent on their spoiling of environment. The total 
fines of last year only accounted for 0.11 percent of the 
country's annual industrial output. 
  "We have raised the minimum of the fines by one-third last 
year... and we are going to make it even higher, so as to compel 
the enterprises to clean up the environment instead of just 
paying fines," he said. 
  Asked about the actual figures for cancers and respiratory 
diseases caused by pollution in China, he said that China has 
yet to compile a set of complete figures on the impact of 
environmental pollution on people's health. 
  "It is a very complicated job. We are still carrying out 
researching programs in this regard," he said. 
  He said that the Chinese Government did not make public to 
the people the World Bank reports on pollution-related diseases 
in the country, because it has to consult with relevant 
departments to "verify the preciseness of the international 
figures." 
  Asked about China taking out gall bile from living bears, Qu 
said that China's wild life protection policy is to "carefully 
protect, actively reproduce and rationally utilize" wild animals. 
  "China has a large number of bears," he said. "On this 
precondition, we should consider utilizing them for medical 
purposes." 
  He said that keeping one bear for medical use will avoid the 
killing of 220 bears. And the bear will not suffer great pains.

  [Text] Yinchuan, March 14 (XINHUA) -- A massive 
afforestation campaign in north, northwest and northeast China 
(the "three-north" region) has stifled the encroachment of 
deserts in the region and helped form an economic belt there, 
official sources said. 
  Rows of desert-defying forest greenbelts, orchards, newly 
developed farmland and tourist attractions with a taste of the 
wild desert have diminished the ferocity of the desert that once 
dominated the region. 
  Many of the country's desert areas are scattered over more 
than 260 counties in 13 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions in the "three-north" region, which has plus-1.9 billion 
mu (about 12.7 million ha [hectare]) of desert and desertified 
land. 
  The lingering desert problem, compounded by the arid 
climate, 
frequent wind storms and a vicious cycle of escalating wind and 
desert, has harmed farmland, devoured pastureland, buried 
houses, disrupted transportation and overall severely affected 
the lives and production of some 35 million local people. 
  Since a comprehensive "three-north" afforestation campaign 
was launched 15 years ago, more than 70 million mu (4.67 million 
ha) of desert land has been planted with various species of 
trees, in addition to afforestation of 56 million mu (3.73 
million ha) of enclosed desert land and aerial seeding of some 
7.5 million mu (500,000 ha) of land. 
  The figures have combined to help raise the region's total 
area with tree cover to over 200 million mu (13.3 million ha). 
  So far some 12 percent of the "three-north" desertified land 
has been improved and around 20 million mu (1.33 million ha) of 
farmland has been developed in the former deserts. 
  In the region's 164 million mu (around 11 million ha) of 
farmland whose yields were perenially poor and unstable because 
of storms and the advance of the desert, grain output has been 
hiked by 10 to 30 percent. 
  And grass output in the 134 million mu (8.93 million ha) of 
pastoral land threatened by desertification and salinization has 
increased by more than 20 percent. 
  The green drive has meanwhile spurred the local forestry and 
fruit tree planting industries. The region's commercial 
orchards now produce more than six billion kg of fresh and dried 
fruits annually, bringing in an additional six billion yuan 
(about 690 million U.S. dollars) in output value. 
  In Inner Mongolia's Chifeng city and Jirem League, both open 
to the unbridled assault of desert storms in the past, a 
seven-million- mu-sized production base for mountain almonds has 
been established, yielding six million kg of such almonds a 
year. The output of apples and pears in the specialized 
production base in Bayannur League is 10 million kg annually, 
and the Wuhai Grape Production Center produces five million kg a 
year. 
  North China's Shaanxi Province has set up a six-million-mu 
willow production and processing zone, which annually earns more 
than 20 million yuan (2.3 million U.S. dollars) in profits and 
2.8 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. 
  Officials said that the planting of commercial forests has 
become one of the mainstay industries in the local economy. 
  They said that the forest belts, reservoirs and newly-built 
houses on the most extreme frontiers of deserts have marked the 
turning point of man's fight against deserts. 
  In Yulin of Shaanxi Province, four desert forest belts add 
up 
to 1,500 km in length, covering an area of 1.8 million mu 
(120,000 ha). The belts have effectively halted desert 
expansion, officials said. 
  Neighboring Gansu Province has so far improved and 
afforested 
some five million mu (333,000 ha) of desertified land as well as 
protected 4.7 million mu (310,000 ha) of farmland and orchards 
from the intrusion of desert and 1,400 villages from being 
swallowed up by drifting sands. The arid area has now emerged 
as a major grain producer in north China. 
  Northeast China's Jilin Province has planted eight million 
mu 
(530,000 ha) of trees and claimed a total of four million mu 
(367,000 ha) of farmland from the desert. The province has 
virtually controlled the spreading of deserts, officials said. 
  North China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has considered 
the exploration of desertified land and sand mountains as a 
major source to increase farmers' income. 
  The successful experiences of the "three-north" region of 
China in containing desert expansion and improving desertified 
land has caught attention worldwide. Officials and experts from 
more than 40 countries, regions and the United Nations have 
inspected the afforestation project in China's "three-north" 
region.

  [Text] Yichang, March 14 (XINHUA) -- The mammoth three 
gorges reservoir project now being undertaken on the upper 
reaches of the Chang Jiang will help improve the water quality 
in the middle and lower reaches, according to environmentalists. 
  When the retained water is discharged from the reservoir in 
the dry seasons the extra flow will wash pollutants downstream. 
  Experts on water resources protection came to this 
conclusion 
after three years of on-the-spot investigation. 
  They said the effect is apparent in the section from the 
reservoir site near Yichang to Wuhan, the capital of central 
China's Hubei Province. 
  They started the research in 1990 in four selected sections 
along the Chang Jiang, focusing on water quality changes with 
water level fluctuations. 
  The reservoir, expected to be built over the next 15 years, 
will have a normal water level of 175 m [meters] and a total 
storage capacity of 39.3 billion cu [cubic] m.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- An agreement on 
environmental protection between the Chinese and Japanese 
Governments was signed here today. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa attended the signing ceremony after their two-hour 
talks. 
  Signing of the accord marks that a successful Sino-Japanese 
cooperation on environmental protection over the past decade has 
made another step forward. 
  Xie Zhenhua, head of the Chinese State Bureau of Environment 
Protection, and Michihiko Kunihiro, Japanese ambassador to 
China, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective 
governments. 
  According to Xie, China and Japan started cooperation in 
environmental protection as early as in the 1980's. Since then, 
frequent visits, joint research, personnel training, joint 
scientific and technical projects have been going on between 
Chinese and Japanese technicians and environmental managers. 
  According to an exchange of notes between the two 
governments 
in 1991, Japan donated 10.2 billion Japanese yen to China to set 
up a Sino-Japanese friendship environmental protection center in 
Beijing which is under smooth construction and due to be 
completed by the end of 1995. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, with the aid of the Japanese 
Government, the two countries carried out an investigation of 
the water pollution in Boyang Lake in east China and a 
purification program, which has achieved satisfactory results. 
  During the past few years, China and Japan also stepped up 
cooperation in regional environmental protection such as in 
northeast Asia and northwest Pacific ocean. 
  According to the new agreement signed today, the two 
countries will cooperate in the fields of prevention and control 
of air pollution, acid rain, water pollution and the disposing 
of harmful wasted gases, research in the impact of pollution to 
human health, improvement of urban environment, protection of 
ozonosphere, and protection of natural ecological environment 
and biological varieties. 
  The two sides will strengthen the exchanges of scientists 
and 
technical personnel and of technical information and data 
concerning research and development of environmental protection.

  [Text] Beijing, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Environmental 
Protection Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), 
China's parliament, will be renamed the Environmental and 
Resources Protection Committee of the NPC. 
  The Third Meeting of the Presidium of the Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC today adopted a bill on changing the name of the 
committee submitted by the NPC Environmental Protection 
Committee, and a draft decision on the bill submitted by the 
secretariat of the session. 
  Both the bill and the draft decision will be submitted to 
NPC 
delegations for deliberation. 
  In the bill, the environmental protection committee said 
that, since its establishment, many government departments and 
people have regarded it as being engaged primarily in 
environmental protection, thus paying little attention to the 
committee's work aimed at protecting natural resources. 
  The bill says China now faces serious problems in terms of 
natural resources, including shortages of water resources, 
insufficient farmland resources, vegetation damage, soil 
erosion, desertification and a decrease in the number of 
wildlife. 
  The bill describes the damage and waste of resources as a 
major factor causing environmental pollution. 
  That is why it is necessary to combine legislation and 
supervision in the field of resources protection with those in 
the field of pollution control to make sure that the 
Environmental Protection Committee will be able to better 
perform its duties and functions, the bill says.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (CNS) -- Member of the CPPCC and 
associate researcher of the Chinese Academy of Geological 
Sciences Mr. Wang Mili said today that a grim situation was 
facing the Chinese geological sector as a result of a shortage 
of geological resources and investment as well as a draining of 
talented people from this field. 
  Mr. Wang said that the serious shortage of investment in 
geological prospecting had resulted in known mineral deposits 
not being able to meet the country's needs. Of 45 proven main 
mineral resources, 12 will be in short supply within this 
century and half of the 45 mineral deposits will not keep pace 
with the demands of economic development in the 21st century. 
  Meanwhile, investment in mineral production was falling, 
taking inflation into account, by 10.3 percent annually, 
resulting in a half-closure of one-third of geological 
prospecting teams, with their salaries and living standard 
falling to below the average level in the country. Four such 
teams in Guangdong which had made a great contribution to 
geological work were living in poverty, and similar workers in 
Qinghai Province working on the plateau area for dozens of years 
where oxygen is thin continued to live in bad housing 
conditions, with their children unable to find work and 175 
households, of whom had a per capita income for their daily 
expenses of less than RMB 35 [renminbi] monthly. [sentence as 
received] Such situations had caused many talented people to 
move out of the sector. 
  The mismanagement of mineral deposits was serious resulting 
in environmental pollution, and the safety of workers and public 
order had also been affected. 
  Mr. Wang called for more attention to be given to geological 
work to meet the needs of China's economic development. The 
caring for the country's natural resources should, like the 
control of population and protection of the ecology, be seen as 
a fundamental national policy.

  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese people are 
planting a tree belt along their 18,000-km coastline, according 
to the "China Environment Journal". 
  Work began in 1988, and the tree belt has extended 14,000 km 
so far and covered two million ha. 
  The professional paper noted that Fujian and Hainan 
Provinces 
and Qingdao city in Shandong Province have taken the lead in the 
work. 
  Fujian planted a 3,100-km-long tree belt along its coast and 
around nearby farmland last year. 
  Hainan now has a 1,400-km-long tree belt along its 1,500-km 
coast. 
  Qingdao has vowed to cover its remaining 15 km of coast with 
trees this year. 
  The paper noted that the construction of the "green wall" in 
the coastal areas has effectively weakened typhoons, tidal waves 
and rainstorms, protected stretches of farmland and improved 
ecological conditions.

  [Text] Lanzhou, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Sand from the Tarim 
Basin in the heart of the Asian Continent can easily drift as 
far as the Hawaiian Islands and the mid-Pacific, just with the 
help of the wind. 
  Sand from the Sahara Desert in Africa can drift over the 
Mediterranean Sea to reach the European Continent and even North 
America. 
  These findings were made by Chinese scientists using oxygen 
isotopic comparison and analyzing sediments from the Hawaiian 
Islands and the Pacific Ocean floor. They said that they had 
discovered that most of the quartz particles on the ocean floor 
were dust particles from the heartland of Asia. 
  About five percent of the earth's land mass is covered by 
accumulations of flying and drifting dust. In the world's arid 
areas, 20 percent of which are covered by drifting sand, over 90 
percent of the fine sandy soil is carried away by air movements 
every year. And about 10 tons to 240 tons of sandy soil per sq 
km of land is transported afar every year. 
  Sandy dust from a windstorm in North China last year reached 
the Korean Peninsula and Japan. 
  Experts from meteorology departments and the Lanzhou Desert 
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have concluded that 
chronic aridity, high temperatures, the mutual impact of warm 
and cold air currents and the alternation of high and low 
pressure troughs can produce gales, which, once they enter areas 
with severe wind erosion of the earth's surface, can cause 
damaging sand storms. 
  According to researcher Liu Xianwan, wind tempo has a 
bearing 
on the movement of sandy dust. 
  He Shiliang, another researcher, said that sandy dust starts 
moving when the wind tempo is about four to five m [meters] a 
second. The bigger the wind, the quicker the dust moves and the 
more dust the wind carries away. 
  Scientists have warned that sand storms, which have over the 
past few years become more frequent, may have a significantly 
negative impact on the radiation of solar energy as well as on 
the thermal balance of the earth and the universal climate. 
  They suggested that the most effective way to curb drifting 
dust is to plant and safeguard grass and trees, stop 
over-exploitation of the land and eliminate industrial pollution 
sources.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 9 (XINHUA) -- The municipal 
government of this, China's largest economic center has 
designated 1994 as a "Year for Greening". 
  It is mobilizing all its residents to "develop Shanghai into 
a clean, beautiful and comfortable ecological city." 
  According to the plan, the government will build or expand 
four parks and complete a number of greening projects to expand 
the public green areas by 133 ha, and plant a 500-meter-wide 
tree belt around the city this year. 
  Shanghai has made progress in beautifying its urban area 
over 
the past few years. 
  Last year saw the city add 157.54 ha of green areas and four 
parks, and plant 10.23 million trees. The city now averages 
1.15 sq m of green area per capita. 
  The city's green coverage rate reached 13.5 percent of its 
urban area last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Guo Yunling (6753 0336 5376): "State Council </F>
Gives Written Reply to the `National Program for Water and Soil 
Reservation'"] 
  [Text] Recently the State Council gave an official, 
written reply to the "National Program for Water and Soil 
Conservation," agreeing in principle to carry out the water and 
soil conservation work in accordance with the second 
proposition. This means that China now has a fundamental basis 
to go by in carrying out the work. 
  Soil erosion in China, which is enormous in magnitude and 
covers vast tracks of territory, has inflicted great harm on the 
country. It has brought about long-term low yields and poverty 
to localities, and even is endangering the subsistence of the 
masses of people in some localities. Moreover, the running down 
of silt in large quantities has caused floods and waterlogging 
along the lower reachers of rivers. To work out this national 
program for water and soil conservation, the Ministry of Water 
Resources organized national forces to conduct large amounts of 
investigation and study, scientific experiments, and observation 
analyses. 
  In its reply, the State Council stressed: To do a good job 
in water and soil conservation has a bearing on economic and 
social development and on ecological environmental improvement, 
and helps China shake off poverty and gain prosperity. It also 
has a bearing on the development and harnessing of rivers and 
lakes, as well as on the state's construction in the energy, 
railway, communications, and mining industries, and other areas 
of endeavor. It is a basic national policy that will yield 
success in our time and will bring benefits throughout the ages. 
Therefore, we should uphold it for a long time. The reply 
pointed out: Water and soil conservation is a systems 
engineering undertaking. It must adhere to the principle of 
"prevention as the key factor, overall planning, comprehensive 
prevention and control, suiting measures to local conditions, 
and stressing better management and efficiency." Effective 
efforts should be made to ensure the prevention, protection, and 
supervision of soil erosion, and to ensure law enforcement work. 
The policy should be implemented whereby those who harness 
rivers and lakes and those who manage and protect them will reap 
the benefits therefrom. While devoting our primary efforts 
toward bringing the Huang He and the Chang Jiang under control, 
we also should pay close attention to checking soil erosion in 
other rivers and to the water and soil conservation work in the 
key soil erosion prevention and protection areas, supervision 
areas, and control areas at all levels. 
  The "National Program for Water and Soil Conservation" puts 
forward two propositions on soil erosion control, of which the 
second one suggests a more rapid pace of control. The State 
Council's reply agreed in principle to carry out the water and 
soil conservation work in accordance with the second proposition.

  [Text] Guangzhou, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, 
south China, will place more emphasis on improving its forestry 
ecology in the coming years, government sources said. 
  During the past eight years, almost all the previously 
barren 
hills in the province have been covered with green, two years 
ahead of the provincial government's "ten-year greening 
schedule" initiated in 1985. 
  In the new effort the province plans to plant some 3.33 
million ha [hectare] of ecological woods, which will serve 
purposes such as water and soil conservation, coastal 
windbreaking, nature reserves and forest tourism. 
  The necessary funds will be mainly set aside in the budget 
plan of governments at various levels, but the project will also 
receive money from the state and the general public. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial government has called on local 
authorities to plant more fast-growing trees, exert more efforts 
in processing forestry products and tap forestry tourism 
resources.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Afforestation is in 
full swing across southern China. 
  According to the latest statistics, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, 
Anhui, 
Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had planted trees on 902,000 ha 
by the end of February, fulfilling their annual afforestation 
plan by 43.8 percent. 
  The Anhui Provincial Government held a mobilization meeting 
attended by local leading officials and afforestation bureau 
chiefs as early as on January 1 to draw up a plan for 
afforesting all barren hills within this year. 
  Leading officials of Guangxi and Zhejiang took the lead in 
planting trees earlier this year. 
  The local governments of 23 counties in Hubei Province 
organized 1.978 million laborers to plant trees on hills and 
mountains soon after the spring festival, the traditional 
Chinese new year, which fell on February 10. 
  Meanwhile, Hunan Province has planted trees on 93,000 ha in 
the Chang Jiang River valley so far.

  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Ercel J. Baker, 
Canadian assistant deputy minister of fisheries, has written to 
Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun making clear the 
Canadian Government's stand on the export of seal products to 
China. 
  Recently, an international animal rights organization 
accused 
China's Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation of violating the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES) by importing 50,000 dead seals from 
Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador Province to make aphrodisiacs 
out of sex organs severed from male seals. 
  Some Western countries' newspapers gave this accusation a 
lot 
of coverage. Some congressmen of a certain country even 
proposed a bill to attack China on the issue. 
  Baker said in the letter: "I am writing to express the 
support of the Government of Canada, and to seek the support of 
your government for the joint venture between Terra Nova Fishery 
Co. Ltd. (TNF) and the Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation 
(SFGC) to produce seal products for export to China. The 
government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador also 
strongly supports the project. 
  "We share the concern of your government regarding the 
unfounded allegations that seals will be harvested for the sole 
purpose of using the male sex organs to make sexual stimulants. 
  "It has been common practice for the more extreme groups 
(campaigning against seal hunting) to make sensational 
allegations to stir up controversy and attract media attention." 
  The letter pointed out that the proposed venture is fully 
consistent with Canada's commitment to the conservation and 
rational management of marine resources based on the principle 
of sustainable development. 
  There is a long-established commercial seal hunt in Canada 
which is closely regulated, the letter said. 
  Canada encourages full use of harvested seals and would 
oppose any project to kill seals only for a small part of the 
animal, the letter went on. 
  The joint venture involves the harvesting and use of the 
whole seal, the letter noted. It conforms to the licensing 
requirements and regulations of the Governments of Canada and 
the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Equally, it is fully 
in accord with international conservation requirements. 
  Baker emphasized that the harp seal is not regulated by the 
convention because it is not endangered or threatened, and 
therefore no CITES permit would be required for export of harp 
seal products from Canada. 
  At the end of the letter, Baker said he hoped that the 
Chinese Government would consider this project favorably and 
approve the joint venture.

  [Text] Nagoya, March 15 KYODO -- Nitrogen oxides and ozone 
from the Asian Continent are contributing to air pollution over 
the western Pacific, researchers at Nagoya University said 
Tuesday [15 March]. 
  The researchers, led by Yutaka Kondo, professor at the 
university's solar-terrestrial environmental laboratory, used 
data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) survey of chemical substances in the atmosphere. 
  The pollutants are carried from the Asian mainland to the 
Pacific by prevailing westerly winds, the researchers said. 
  Low-altitude ozone results from a chemical change in 
atmospheric oxygen, with nitrogen oxides from automobile 
exhausts and coal-fired power stations serving as catalysts. 
  Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low-altitude ozone can 
damage the respiratory system when in high densities. 
  The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts 
per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB. 
  But at altitudes of 2,000 to 3000 meters off the coasts near 
Taiwan and Hong Kong, ozone densities were more than 100 PPB, 
and off Japan, nitrogen oxide densities were 1 PPB. 
  A member of the research team, Hideaki Nakajima, said the 
pollutants detected are responsible for acid rain and could 
eventually cause forests near the Pacific to die off unless 
countries in the region quickly produce a preventive strategy. 
  China and Russia, with their relatively low environmental 
standards, have previously been identified as responsible for 
much of the pollution in the region, but this is the first 
empirical evidence to back up the claims.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Draft proposals for the 
restructuring of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) urge the 
facility to avoid wasting money by setting up a 30-nation body 
to oversee the funding and carrying out of projects, government 
sources said Saturday [12 March]. 
  The draft notes that in some cases funds may have been 
wasted 
because the opinions of developing countries were not fully 
taken into account when funds were distributed. 
  It says membership of the assessment body should reflect 
opinion among all countries concerned, including developing ones. 
  Japan contributes funds to the GEF and the sources said the 
government is likely to accept most of the provisions of the 
draft. 
  The GEF began operations in 1990 to provide grants for 
assisting developing countries to protect the global 
environment, including combating global warming and pollution of 
international waters, and for transferring environmentally 
benign technology. 
  Responsibility for implementing the GEF is shared by the 
United Nations Development Program, the UN Environment Program 
and the World Bank. 
  But many developing countries have criticized GEF 
operations, 
prompting agreement at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 
that it be restructured. 
  Participating countries have also agreed that the facility's 
current total funding of 800 million dollars be increased to 2 
billion dollars. 
  The draft suggests that the voting system also take into 
account developing countries' wishes with a dual vote system 
consisting of a "one country-one vote" system combined with a 
second-round vote, with votes weighted depending on the amount 
of funds contributed. 
  The final draft will be debated at a March 14-16 meeting of 
countries concerned in Geneva.

  [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japan and China signed a 
treaty Sunday [20 March] to promote bilateral cooperation on 
environmental preservation, Japanese officials said. 
  Japanese Ambassador to China Michihiko Kunihiro and Zie 
Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection 
Bureau, signed the treaty, while Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese Premier Li Peng attended the 
signing ceremony. 
  Under the treaty, Japan and China will boost exchanges 
between experts and exchange information to prevent acid rain, 
water and air pollution and disposal of noxious waste. 
  The two nations will also hold joint seminars and meetings 
to 
discuss cooperation. 
  The two sides will set up a joint committee to review the 
bilateral cooperation once a year. 
  China relies on coal-fired power stations for more than 70 
percent of its electricity. Burning of coal releases large 
amounts of sulfur dioxide believed to cause acid rain. 
  The treaty will be good for two years.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Shanghai and Bangkok will 
be the subject of a three-year study by a group of Japanese 
scientists to help curb environmental destruction in the face of 
Asia's rapidly expanding population, officials of the Health and 
Welfare Ministry said Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The study will be launched later this year and will focus on 
the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption 
of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the 
officials said. 
  Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn 
entire regions into deserts. 
  The team of scientists from the ministry's Institute of 
Population Problems and Institute of Public Health hope to 
improve long-term forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in Asia 
by examining the causes of population growth and the impact of 
rural migration to cities, they said. 
  The group will also look at how global warming affects the 
spread of malaria, they said. 
  The results of the study will be used to draw up population 
and energy conservation policies that could help reduce the 
impact of global warming. 
  The Environment Agency will incorporate the findings in its 
"Eco- Asia 21 Plan" and will try to enlist support from other 
Asian countries, the officials said. 
  World population is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by 
the turn of the century from 5.3 billion in 1990. According to 
United Nations population fund forecasts, it will further swell 
to 8.5 billion in 2025, with more than half of the growth 
occurring in Asia, mainly China and India. 
  Rural migration is likely to continue, raising the portion 
of 
people living in Asian cities from 30 percent of total 
population to over 50 percent in 2020. 
  The National Institute for Environmental Studies estimates 
that Asia's energy consumption will show annual growth rates of 
3.2 percent, far outstripping the world average of 1.6 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 15 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
The leading officials of organisations under the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) released 
statements denouncing criminal dumping of nuclear waste by the 
South Korean authorities. 
  Om Chang-pom, chief director of the Federation of Korean 
Traders and Industrialists in Japan, charged that the Kim 
Yong-sam clique which has dumped radioactive substances into the 
sea, ignoring the international convention totally banning it, 
is, indeed, a group of savages who have no idea of the nation 
and international law. 
  He urged the Kim Yong-sam clique to immediately stop seeking 
confrontation and division in conspiracy with outside forces, 
scrap the "National Security Law," an anti-reunification law, 
and open to the public the amount of the nuclear waste they have 
already dumped into the sea, its kinds and the dumping places 
and apologize to the nation. 
  The chairman of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, Pak 
Ku-ho, said that the grave anti-national, anti-human criminal 
act committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is directly 
linked with the nuclear weapon development that has been 
promoted in secrecy and has already reached a dangerous stage in 
South Korea. 
  "The purpose sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in its 
malicious anti-DPRK smear campaign over the fictitious `nuclear 
issue of the North' is to divert the attention of the people at 
home and abroad to the North and then hasten its nuclear weapon 
development," he emphasized. 
  So Cha-yon, chairwoman of the Democratic Union of Korean 
Women in Japan, Pak Yong-kon, chairman of the Association of 
Korean Social Scientists in Japan, and Kim Chong-su, chairman of 
the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, 
also denounced the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam 
group as a towering crime against the nation and mankind.

<F P=106> [Report by Emily R. Pena] </F>
  [Text] The Batangas Coastal Resources Management Foundation 
(BCRMF) signed recently a memorandum of understanding to 
preserve the Batangas environment. 
  Batangas Governor Vicente A. Mayo, BCRMF chairman, said the 
agreement seeks to make the province an environmental-friendly 
zone by organizing a movement that will reorient the values and 
practices of the community for the sustainable development of 
the area. 
  The movement, called "Kilos Kabayan para sa Kalikasan 
[Citizens Movement for the Environment]," brings together 
government and the private sector in a cooperative effort. 
  To encourage the development of comprehensive environment 
preservation and management plans, the movement, with the help 
of Lifewatch Communication Services, has lined up various 
environmental activities in which the community can participate 
to bring about an eventual practice in waste management. 
  "We realize that Batangas is faced with immense challenges 
stemming from accelerated socio-economic progress envisioned in 
the Calabarzon [Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon] national 
development program," Mayo said. The Batangas governor urged 
his constituents to act together in preserving the future of 
Batangas. 
  "Rising population in the coastal area has increased 
expectations of improved livelihood, health, education 
communication, and other social services making us realize that 
we must act as one if we are to preserve our future," he said. 
  The foundation members are Pilipinas Shell, Caltex 
Philippines, Chemphil-LMG, Keppel Philippines, Engineering 
Equipment, General Milling Corp., Purefoods Corp., Union Carbide 
Philippines, United Coconut Chemicals, AG &amp; P, and Mabuhay 
Vinyl 
Corp., which hope to enhance and promote sustainable development 
of the Batangas coastal resources. 
  Signatories to the memo of understanding include 
representatives of the governments of Batangas City, Bauan, San 
Pascual, and Mabini, the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR), Department of Education, Culture, and Sports 
(DECS), Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Philippine Ports Authority 
(PPA), and the Philippine National Police (PNP).

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos on Wednesday [16 March] 
directed the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
[DENR] and the Bureau of Customs to strictly implement the 
government's policy prohibiting the entry or importation of 
wastes, whether toxic or safe. President Ramos specifically 
ordered the Bureau of Customs to send back immediately to their 
countries of origin all shipments of imported wastes. At the 
same time he ordered the Bureau of Customs to strengthen its 
surveillance and inspection system and to monitor and check all 
incoming cargoes to see if they carry waste materials. 
  The directives are issued on the heels of the arrival over 
this month from Australia, the shipment of electronic metal 
scrap consigned to a local firm. 
  The government's policy prohibiting the importation of all 
kinds of wastes, whether toxic or safe, is contained in the 
approved integrated national solid waste management system 
framework, which provides that no technologies shall be allowed 
that will require the importation of wastes of any kind, whether 
toxic or safe. This policy is in consonance with Republic Act 
No. 6969, which provides that it is state policy to prohibit the 
entry, even in transit, of hazardous and nuclear waste and their 
disposal into the Philippine territory. 
  Initial investigation by the DENR of the cargo from 
Australia 
carried aboard the MV Tsadasa GIW revealed that the cargo 
contained used mixed electronic memory scrap, as indicated in 
the cargo manifest.

<F P=106> [Report by Elena L. Aben] </F>
  [Text] The Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
(DENR), and the Metro Manila Authority (MMA) yesterday launched 
a program aimed at rehabilitating the diminishing marine 
resources of the Manila Bay, once considered among the richest 
fishing grounds in the world. 
  DENR Secretary Angel Alcala, Quezon City Mayor and MMA 
Chairman Ismael Mathay Jr., and Las Pinas Mayor Gabriel Casimiro 
led national and local officials in signing a covenant to 
support the Coastal Environment Program (CEP). 
  The project, which cover the 24-kilometer coast from Las 
Pinas to Navotas was launched at the Santo Nino [Holy Child] 
Island off the Coastal Road. 
  The covenant noted the degradation of the natural resources 
at the Manila Bay, covering an area of about 180,000 hectares 
bounded by several coastal towns. 
  The area was also covered with lush vegetation of mangrove 
species, including the "nilad," where the City of Manila derived 
its name. 
  The covenant, however, stated that all major rivers leading 
to the Manila Bay, as well as its tributaries, are now heavily 
polluted and considered biologically dead. 
  Among the major rivers leading to the bay are the Pasig 
River, Tullahan-Tenejeros River, and Paranaque-Zapote River. 
  It also noted that garbage and refuse dumped by residents 
along these waterways and careless disposal of industrial 
wastes; and poor sewage treatment of industries contribute to 
water pollution in the area. 
  The covenant likewise stated that the water pollution is 
aggravated by oil spills from gas stations, oil depots, barges, 
tankers, and several ships which also discharge their wastes 
into the bay. 
  The DENR-National Capital Region (NCR), in an effort to put 
a 
stop to the further degradation of the bay, will extend 
assistance and other resources needed to the effective carrying 
out of activities that will protect and enhance the coastal 
environment of the Manila Bay. 
  Alcala said that talisay, dapdap, agoho [local plant 
species], coconut and other trees will be planted to add to the 
biodiversity of the area surrounding the Manila Bay. 
  "We will ring the coastline with mangroves," Alcala, an 
environmentalist and marine biologist, said. 
  Mathay, for his part, said that the program has to be 
sustained because of the rapid development not only in Metro 
Manila but also in nearby regions that bound Manila Bay. 
  Carlos C. Tomboc, DENR-NCR executive director said the 
program will aim to plant trees that will attract wildlife 
resources like bats, birds, and butterflies. 
  Several Metro Manila residents, according to Mathay, do not 
recognize or have not yet seen the species of trees that they 
will plant. 
  He said the long term goal of the program will be to 
establish a mangrove seashore park where wildlife species can 
survive and which will be called the "bio-diversity center" of 
Metro Manila.

  [Text] Taipei, March 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will observe the 
regulations laid down by the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (FCCC), the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) 
said Monday [21 March]. 
  The FCCC, promoted by the United Nations as an environmental 
protection measure and based on conclusions reached during the 
1992 earth summit, went into effect Monday. 
  Under the FCCC, emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
"greenhouse" gases are to be limited to their 1990 levels. 
  The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously estimated that 
the carbon dioxide level in Taiwan in 2000 would be up 109 
percent over the 1990 level. 
  EPA officials said that although Taiwan is not a UN member, 
it would not turn away from its responsibility as a member of 
international community and observe the convention. 
  They noted that Taiwan is prepared to submit a report on its 
progress in reducing carbon dioxide emissions during the first 
FCCC conference to be held next March in Berlin.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Representatives from 
three Taiwan conservation organizations will be allowed to speak 
at a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES) meeting to be held Monday [21 March] in Geneva. 
  Representatives from the Society of Wildlife and Nature, the 
Beautiful Taiwan Foundation and the Green Consumers' Foundation 
are expected to detail Taiwan's efforts to end its illegal trade 
in endangered species parts and products during the CITES 
meeting open only to non-government organizations (NGO). 
  The NGO meeting gives non-CITES members an opportunity to 
explain their wildlife conservation efforts to CITES delegates. 
The meeting is sponsored by the British Environmental 
Investigation Agency (EIA), according to beautiful Taiwan 
Foundation Chairman Ted Ting. 
  As of Saturday, representatives from 10 NGO's had applied to 
speak during the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, officials from the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation 
and 
the Green Consumers' Foundation announced in Jerusalem earlier 
this week that they will join an Asian region CITES task force 
to combat illegal trade in wildlife products, Ting said. 
  Israel, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and Uzbekistan have 
all 
expressed interest in joining the task force, Ting added.

<F P=106> [Report by Hao Hsueh-ching and Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, March 21 (CNA) -- A Republic of China [ROC] 
delegation to the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) Standing Committee meeting has 
decided not to attend the proceedings. 
  "After careful consideration, we have decided not to attend 
the CITES meeting to avoid possible embarrassment that might 
arise from facing mainland Chinese delegates," said Li San-wei, 
head of the nine-member Taiwan delegation which arrived in 
Geneva Sunday [20 March] to dissuade the CITES from imposing 
trade sanctions on Taiwan over wildlife conservation issues. 
  "Nevertheless," Li said, "we'll grasp every informal 
opportunity to explain our conservation efforts to delegates 
from other countries." Li is also deputy director of the ROC 
Council of Agriculture's Forestry Department. 
  The CITES meeting, which opened Monday, will discuss 
rhinoceros and tiger conservation as well as review progress in 
wildlife conservation in Mainland China, South Korea, Yemen and 
Taiwan. 
  Although Taiwan is not a CITES member, CITES Standing 
Committee Chairman Murray Hosking had hoped Taiwan would attend 
the Geneva meeting as an observer. 
  As Mainland China, a CITES member, has consistently claimed 
sovereignty over Taiwan and sought to downgrade Taiwan in 
international arenas, Taiwan delegates decided not to attend any 
formal CITES Standing Committee sessions here. Even if Taiwan 
delegates were to attend such sessions, they would not be 
allowed to speak. 
  The Taiwan delegates, however, will take part in 
non-government organizations (NGO) sessions to be sponsored by 
the CITES Standing Committee in connection with its formal 
annual meeting. During the NGO sessions, Li Ling-ling, a 
zoology professor at National Taiwan University, will detail 
Taiwan's efforts to end illegal trade in protected wildlife 
products. 
  Representatives from three private Taiwan conservation 
organizations will also speak in the NGO sessions, stressing 
Taiwan's determination to eliminate illegal wildlife trade. 
  Before coming to Geneva, the Taiwan delegates attended a 
March 14-18 CITES Asian region conference in Jerusalem.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Bhutanese Princess Dekiy 
Wangchuck [spelling of name as received], arrested last 
September for attempting to smuggle 22 rhino horns and nine bear 
gall bladders into Taiwan, was sentenced to 10 months in jail 
Friday [18 March]. 
  Wangchuck, 43, had been detained by the Taoyuan District 
Court since last Sept. 18 on charges of smuggling endangered 
species products and violating the wildlife conservation laws. 
  Although Wangchuck holds a diplomatic passport, the 
prosecutors said the case was handled according to ordinary 
criminal procedures to demonstrate the government's 
determination in cracking down on smuggling and illegal trade in 
endangered species and related products. Taiwan and Bhutan do 
not have formal diplomatic ties. 
  Police seized the 22 rhino horns, weighing 14.8 kilograms 
and 
nine bear gall bladders, reportedly worth U.S.$300,000 on the 
Taiwan market, when Wangchuck arrived at Chiang Kai-shek 
International Airport from Hong Kong Sept. 17, 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 14 (CNA) -- In the face of building 
international pressure to hit Taiwan with sanctions for its 
failure to sufficiently crack down on trade in endangered 
wildlife and wildlife parts, Taiwan on Monday [14 March] 
released the draft of a harsh conservation law. 
  The Council of Agriculture finished the revision of the 
draft 
Wildlife Protection Law, which provides for a jail term of up to 
seven years or a fine of NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million 
(U.S.$94,700) for those who violate the law. 
  The draft law, which was still being screened at the council 
Sunday afternoon, was sent to the Executive Yuan on Monday and 
will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval on [words 
indistinct]. 
  The rush comes at the same time the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is taking 
a serious look at a boycott proposal against Taiwan for its 
alleged "perfunctory" crackdown on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger bone. 
  More than 100 conservation representatives from 27 countries 
are gathering in Jerusalem for a four-day meeting at which 
Taiwan's wildlife protection efforts are to be discussed. 
  A nine-member Taiwan delegation is attending the meeting as 
an observer, but will not be allowed to attend any discussions. 
  In Taipei, a local conservation group, Green Consumers 
Foundation, denied accusations that Taiwan is a "black hole of 
smuggled animals." 
  "Even if there were a black hole, it was created by CITES's 
own inappropriate membership requirements," a foundation 
official said. "It is unreasonable not to give Taiwan membership 
while asking it to assume the due responsibility of a member." 
  Jay Fong, secretary-general of the foundation, is a member 
of 
the ROC delegation going to Israel. Fang plans to release an 
investigation report on illegal trade of tiger bone and rhino 
horn on the island.

<F P=106> [Report by Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan, or 
cabinet, on Thursday [17 March] endorsed an amendment to the 
Wildlife Conservation Law as part of the government's efforts to 
stave off trade boycott pressure from the international 
community. 
  The revised law, pending the approval of the Legislative 
Yuan, stipulates that without the permission of relevant 
government authorities, endangered wildlife and endangered 
wildlife products may not be traded or displayed at public 
places. 
  Anyone found guilty could face penalties up to five years in 
jail or a fine of up to NT$1.5 million [New Taiwan dollars] 
(U.S.$56,820). Repeat offenders could be sentenced up to seven 
years or fined up to NT$2.5 million. 
  Executive Yuan officials have been working nights in an 
effort to finish screening the revised law, hoping that it can 
be admitted to the legislature for final approval by March 20, a 
deadline previously set by the United States. 
  U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit announced in mid-1993 
that Taiwan, along with several other countries, had only 
perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino horn 
and tiger bone, and threatened to hit Taiwan with sanctions. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton later postponed the deadline 
Clinton will announce at the end of this month whether to effect 
sanctions against Taiwan. [sentence as received] 
  The U.S. is linking its boycott decision to a fact-finding 
report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES), which is charting Taiwan's progress in cracking 
down on the trade. 
  It is reported that CITES, now gathering in Jerusalem, is 
mulling the possibility of recommending that the United States 
go ahead with a boycott. 
  According to a CNA dispatch from Israel two days ago, Murray 
Hosking, director of the CITES Standing Committee, in his speech 
to the CITES Asian regional conference, pointed out that he 
hopes more substantial results come out before a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee opens in Geneva on March 21.

  [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan will most likely be 
hit with sanctions by the United States and the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) for alleged 
poor performance in wildlife protection, according to Ted Ting, 
head of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation (BTF). 
  Ting, who is visiting several wildlife protection groups in 
Washington D.C., said in a message to BTF headquarters Wednesday 
[9 March] that there seems to be a consensus among U.S. and 
CITES officials to "sanction Taiwan first and keep the Chinese 
mainland on the watch list." 
  Ting said that the international community seems to be 
losing 
patience over Taiwan's inability to crack down on alleged 
illegal trade in rhino horns and tiger bone. 
  Besides, he added, they are also upset with Taipei's failure 
to keep its promise to submit amendments to its Wildlife 
Protection Law to the Legislative Yuan for approval by the end 
of February. 
  The U.S. and CITES have several times turned down requests 
by 
non- governmental organizations to impose sanction against 
Taiwan. 
  But now, Ting said, they believe Taiwan is not serious about 
improving its wildlife protection record. 
  In related news, Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung of the 
Council 
of Agriculture said Wednesday that his council will send the 
revised Wildlife Protection Law to the legislature March 20.

  [Text] Taipei, March 11 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan 
Thursday [10 March] introduced further amendments to the 
Wildlife Conservation Law which stipulate longer prison terms 
and heavier fines for violators. 
  After two days of debate, yuan members completed new 
amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which introduce 
tougher measures to crackdown on illegal trade in wildlife in 
Taiwan. 
  The amendments stipulate that those found guilty of hunting 
or killing protected wild animals face prison terms of up to 
five years and fines as high as NT [New Taiwan] $1 million 
(U.S.$37,037). Repeat offenders face up to seven years in prison 
and fines up to NT$2.5 million (U.S.$92,592). 
  Previously, prison terms for such violations ranged from six 
months to three years, and most sentences were commuted to small 
fines. 
  The amendments also stipulate that persons who abuse animals 
and display protected wildlife, either publicly or privately, 
will be fined NT$300,000 or sentenced to less than one year in 
jail. 
  Medicine shops which sell products labeled as containing 
endangered species preparations but actually containing legal 
substitutes also face fines of between NT$100,000 and 
NT$500,000, the draft said. 
  The amendments will be sent to the Legislative Yuan next 
week 
for approval. 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that 
pressure from the United States Government to boost wildlife 
protection is mounting as U.S. lawmakers and conservationists 
have become "impatient" and "disappointed" at Taiwan's efforts 
to crack down on illegal trade in rhino horn and tiger parts and 
the late enactment of an efficient Wildlife Protection Law. 
  Senator Jack Fields (R-Vt.) said Thursday in Washington that 
he and a number of other senators will soon send a letter to 
President Bill Clinton demanding trade sanctions against 
Mainland China, Taiwan and Korea for their illegal trade in 
endangered animals and products. 
  Fields said the letter will also ask Taiwan for cash 
donations to help preserve rhinoceroses and tigers. 
  President Clinton has until March 25 to decide whether to 
impose trade sanctions against Mainland China and Taiwan for 
illegal trade in rhino horn and tiger parts in violation of the 
international Convention of International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES).

<F P=106> ["NATION report" by James Fahn] </F>
  [Text] The companies planning to build a pipeline to 
transport natural gas from an offshore field in Burma to 
Thailand have for the first time revealed the route the pipeline 
will take. 
  Human rights and environmental groups fear that its 
construction will lead to extensive deforestation and the 
displacement of villagers and refugees in order to secure the 
route. 
  Several refugee camps in the area have already been burnt 
down and their inhabitants ordered out, although no explanation 
was given by the Thai authorities. 
  North of the route, Mon rebel leaders are coming under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the Burmese 
government. Mon troops are at present skirmishing with Burmese 
soldiers. 
  Assuming that the national oil companies of Burma and 
Thailand -- the Myanmar [Burma] Oil &amp; Gas Enterprise (MOGE) 
and 
the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- can come to an 
agreement on the price Thailand will pay for the gas, the 
pipeline will come ashore between the towns of Ye and Tavoy in 
Burma and follow the Tavoy and Zinba river valleys up toward the 
border of Thailand. 
  It will then cross highlands of dense virgin forest to enter 
Thailand at Ban I-Tong (Nai Et Taung in Burma) in Kanchanaburi 
Province. 
  From Ban I-Tong, the pipeline will follow a road down to 
Thong Pha Phum and then head south to a new power plant to be 
built in Ratchaburi. 
  Total, a French state-owned oil company which has signed a 
production-sharing agreement with the Burmese government for the 
offshore field in the Gulf of Martaban, will be responsible for 
constructing the pipeline in Burma while PTT will build it on 
the Thai side. 
  The pipeline's chosen course was revealed in a letter dated 
Jan 12 from Joseph Daniel, Total's director of communications, 
to Yvette Pierpaoli, a French refugee worker. A copy of the 
letter has been obtained by THE NATION. 
  The letter claims that by following the river valleys in 
Burma -- where there are only "scattered shrubs" -- and the 
existing road in Thailand, the pipeline's environmental impact 
would be minimized. "Only the very last (two to three) 
kilometres in Burma... will require cutting some trees," it says. 
  "No population displacement is required on the Total 
pipeline 
course which follows a region which as far as we have seen is 
perfectly quiet," it adds. The letter claims that surveys along 
the course have been carried out by foot, car, and helicopter 
since last April. 
  The route was confirmed by a PTT source who wished to remain 
anonymous. The source said a decision on the route was made 
several months ago. Talks between Burma, Thailand and Total 
were being held yesterday in Bangkok over the price of the gas. 
  The route is significant in that it helps to explain recent 
events at the border. On April 7, last year, the 9th Division 
of the Royal Thai Army reportedly burned down two villages -- 
Aung Tha Pye and Democracy Village -- just south of Ban l-Tong, 
displacing 500 people in all, most of them ethnic Tavoyar 
refugees. 
  At the time, the PTT denied knowing about the evictions and 
claimed the pipeline would follow the old "Death Railway" route 
from Amherst in Burma through Three Pagoda Pass, well north of 
Ban I- Tong. 
  More recently, Mon and Karen groups have come under 
increasing pressure to sign a ceasefire with the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) which rules Burma. Both Mon 
and Karen soldiers are active in the area where the pipeline 
will be laid. 
  Sources claim that Burmese troops from Kaleinaung approached 
the border on Feb 20 near Sangkhla Buri, roughly 30 kms north of 
Ban I- Tong and 10 kms south of Three Pagoda Pass. Over the 
last few weeks, the Mon National Liberation Army, which has its 
headquarters in the area, has reportedly fought intermittent 
battles with Slorc soldiers, who gained control of Three Pagoda 
Pass and Nai Et Taung several years ago. 
  At the same time, the 7,000 Mon refugees in the Loh Loe 
refugee camp near Sangkhla Buri have been ordered by Thai 
military authorities to move to Hlakhani -- located on the 
border around five kms from the Slorc military camp at Three 
Pagoda Pass -- by the end of this month. 
  Phisan Phalatsing, a leader of the Mon community in 
Thailand, 
fears that this will leave the refugees extremely vulnerable to 
attacks by Slorc. 
  "It's quite clear that the Mon are being pressured to agree 
to a ceasefire so that the pipeline can be built," he said at a 
protest held two weeks ago in front of the UN building in 
Bangkok. 
  A leaflet handed out by the Thai-Mon protesters stated that 
"Onshore and off-shore natural resources -- such as timber, 
fish, oil and gas -- left over by Mon forefathers in posterity 
are being sold at a pittance by the Slorc to benefit a small 
military clique. Mons, who are the real owners, have no voice 
whatsoever in the disposal of this inheritance." 
  Meanwhile, within Burma, 20,000-30,000 villagers have been 
conscripted to build a railroad from Ye to Tavoy and to upgrade 
the road which runs between the two coastal towns. The railroad 
is considered important for Burma's national development but 
will also make it easier for Slorc troops to secure the area 
where the pipeline will be laid. 
  Conditions at the worksites are reported to be appalling and 
have led many villagers to escape to Thailand, adding to numbers 
in refugee camps. 
  The PTT source contacted yesterday said Thailand had 
preferred a more southerly route for the pipeline but Burmese 
authorities consider the chosen route to be the best in terms of 
security. He admitted to being ignorant, however, of the 
measures being taken to secure the route. 
  "If the pipeline's impact is too harmful, the project will 
have to be dropped," he said. But he expressed hope that the 
money paid by Thailand for the gas would be spread among the 
Burmese people and used to develop the country. 
  "Funding of the pipeline will have to come from outside 
sources, so the Myanmar government will be under pressure to 
develop the pipeline in a proper way," he said. Talks over 
financing have yet to take place, he added.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 15 -- The total resource of natural 
forests increased by 97.6 million cubic metres between 1983 and 
1992, reaching a total of 657.3 million cubic metres. This was 
announced by the Central Committee for Natural Forest Resource 
Statistics. 
  The natural forests include both commercial forests and 
protective forests. In general, commercial forests dropped 
during this period while protective forests increased 
dramatically. 
  The central highland showed the biggest increase of 60 
million cubic metres of protective forests while Duyen Hai, a 
central province, increased its commercial forests by more than 
29.7 million cubic metres. 
  The coverage of natural forests recorded 3 per cent 
increases, making up 26 per cent of the total coverage in the 
country. The central highland and Duyen Hai are considered as 
the largest coverage areas. The rate of coverage ranges from 34 
to 61 per cent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Hungary's economic 
minister on Friday [10 March] praised the cooperative efforts of 
Japan and the United States to clean up the environment in 
Eastern Europe, including his nation. 
  Bela Kadar, Hungary's minister of international economic 
relations, noted that Japan recently offered 1 billion yen to 
support environmental programs in the Eastern European region. 
  Kadar, who is promoting Hungary's transition from a command 
economy to a free market structure, visited Japan to attend a 
conference on Japan-U.S. aid to former Soviet satellite 
countries. 
  Kadar said at a press meeting in Tokyo that Eastern European 
countries are small and their economies are heavily dependent on 
a stable global economy. "The relationship between Japan and 
the U.S. is very important from such a viewpoint." 
  He said that former Soviet bloc countries "must clean up the 
environment, otherwise they cannot hope to attract foreign 
investors," Kadar said.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "State of Radioactive Waste"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- At its meeting yesterday, the 
Government of the Slovak Republic discussed, and took note of, 
the "Concept of Disposing of Radioactive Waste from Nuclear 
Power Generating Facilities and Other Workplaces With Sources of 
Ionizing Radiation." The document was submitted to the 
government session by the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak 
Republic. [passage omitted] 
  Radioactive waste is currently being stored on the premises 
of individual nuclear power stations and the existing capacities 
are about 50 percent full. Spent fuel is being stored in 
storage pools of the wet type [skladovacie bazeny mokreho typu] 
and, in the best possible case, existing storage capacities will 
last until 1997. 
  Dominant among solid waste are a large quantity of 
contaminated soil (1,900 cubic meters) and scrap metal (1,980 
tonnes) stemming from the dismantling of some technical 
installations. According to the Ministry of Economy document, 
radioactive waste from nuclear power stations is being stored in 
various storage systems that represent a fairly big risk from 
the viewpoint of potential environmental impact. 
  The devices needed to handle, pack, and transport 
radioactive 
waste to the storage site have been secured. The long-term safe 
storage of radioactive waste, however, including the storage and 
definitive depositing of spent fuel, has not been secured so 
far, the Ministry of Economy document states.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 9 March. 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  Urgent measures must be adopted to preserve the Chiman 
forest, located in Beni Department, which is being ravaged by 
the saw mills. This is one of the country's richest forests 
because of its wood and fauna species which are now facing an 
accelerated process of destruction. Experts and ethnic groups 
warn that mahogany, which accounts for 80 percent of the timber 
exports, could disappear in two or three years. It is estimated 
that 190,000 cubic meters of mahogany are being exploited 
nationwide per year. The pollution of rivers by the saw mills 
and the destruction of the fauna are also seriously threatening 
the Chiman forest. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 27 Feb 94 pp 1,6) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Today in Rio Branco, Uruguay, Brazilian Environment Minister 
Rubens Ricupero gave Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu 
four atmosphere monitors that will be used to measure the level 
of gas emanating from the Candiota thermoelectrical plant in Rio 
Grande Do Sul. Brazil has thus fulfilled an agreement contained 
in the Jaguarama Declaration signed in August 1980. The 
equipment will be installed in Melo and Vichadero towns to 
determine whether the gases emanating from the Candiota Plant 
are responsible for the acid rain affecting northern Uruguay. 
(Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2200 GMT 7 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Chile </H5>
  Chile's final position on measures to protect whales will be 
decided during the administration of President-elect Eduardo 
Frei who, during his 1993 presidential campaign, expressed his 
opposition to hunting whales. Frei will have to face the 
Japanese Government's oposition to the establishment of a whale 
sanctuary near the Antarctic. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa 
Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 26 Feb 94) 
  The National Environment Commission, Conama, on 5 March 
launched a plan designed to reduce by 60 percent the national 
consumption of substances that harm the ozone layer in Chile. 
Conama Executive Secretary Rafael Asenjo said that the plan 
includes a campaign to mobilize the public, a system to 
subsidize the technological retooling, and the use of an "ozone 
stamp" on products that do not harm the ozone layer. This 
program will last three years. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1657 GMT 5 
Mar 94) 
  Conama Executive Secretary Rafael Asenjo will, on 9 March, 
deliver to the media publications summarizing all the updated 
documents about the Environment Impact Evaluation and National 
Soil Preservation Plan. The first document is an evaluation of 
the impact that new industries have on the environment. There 
are five books in all, containing more than 1,500 pages. 
According to Conama these are the first publications about this 
subject in Chile. The basic environment law which was recently 
promulgated establishes the obligation to evaluate the 
environmental impact of any public or private investment project 
before it is constructed. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in 
Spanish 1000 GMT 9 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Paraguay </H5>
  German experts and the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry 
have carried out a complete study on the forest areas which 
existed in many departments between 1945 and 1992. The study 
shows that 57 percent of Concepcion Department was covered with 
forests in 1945, but in less than 50 years a large part of the 
zone has been deforested. In 1991 the deparment had only 8 
percent of the native forests, and 92 percent of the zone lacked 
a reforestation program. The native forests covered 64 percent 
of San Pedro Department in 1945, but they were reduced to 22 
percent by 1991. (Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish 6 Mar 94 p 44)

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from La Guaira, </F>
Venezuela] 
  [Text] On 4 March, at the presidential summer residence "La 
Guzmania" near Caracas, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and 
his Venezuelan counterpart Rafael Caldera created a high-level 
binational commission that will be subdivided into various work 
groups to deal with the following issues: 
  -- Conclude the pavement of the BR 174 highway, and expand 
the agreement on land transportation. Brazil will pave 200 km 
of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could 
cooperate by supplying the asphalt. 
  -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from 
Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines 
and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get 
electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also 
said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and 
the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have 
weather problems. 
  -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of 
navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins. 
President Franco said during a news conference that he 
discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the 
Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of 
approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco 
said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue 
the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate 
basin." 
  -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the 
possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding 
sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous 
communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between 
the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development 
of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries 
are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in 
Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron 
alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that 
studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop 
the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and 
orderly activities. 
  -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological 
tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation 
for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining. 
The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in 
the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says: 
"The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal 
activities on their common border with determination. With that 
objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of 
appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral 
prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective 
control over the use of equipment and other components used in 
prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination 
of the environment." 
  Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause, 
a 
leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential 
elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its 
position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold 
prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is 
possible they are also being used by the multinationals as 
spearheads for mineral prospecting." 
  -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project: 
The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation 
in carrying out ecological-economic zoning. 
  -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed 
their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United 
States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to 
have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus. 
  -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments 
will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the 
framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
"Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the 
reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border 
trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the 
trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and 
regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to 
public biddings."

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Olguin; from the "Analysis" supplement] </F>
  [Text] As a result of inspections at industries located 
along the country's northern border, the Federal Attorney's 
Office for Environmental Protection [Procuraduria Federal de 
Proteccion al Ambiente] has temporarily or partially closed more 
than 121 companies in the region, and it has permanently shut 
down more than 22, according to official reports obtained by the 
EL FINANCIERO Satellite News Service (Finsat). 
  Likewise, the latest report states 799 companies in the 
northern region of the country were subject to fines or 
penalties. 
  Studies conducted in this field indicate the effects of 
industrial development encouraged for 10 years along Mexico's 
border with the United States have resulted in severe basic 
infrastructure and environmental protection problems. 
  International organizations, such as the World Bank, granted 
several lines of credit for environmental projects in 1993. The 
line of credit granted by the World Bank stipulates that one of 
the two lines of credit granted $1.8 billion for regional 
environmental projects. 
  The Mexican and U.S. Governments came to the conclusion, 
however, the northern region needs $500 million to supply water, 
$2.8 million to treat municipal and industrial waste, $235 
million to treat solid waste, and $750 million to treat and 
eliminate toxic waste. 
  Approximately $277 million were appropriated last year for 
regional infrastructure projects. The amount is equivalent to a 
60.11-percent annual growth if compared to the 1992 budget. 
  The government budgeted $173 million two years ago to build 
facilities for the treatment of water, elimination of solid 
waste, highways and transportation, settlements, and human 
infrastructure. 
  In sum, the government spent $1.5 billion between 1991 and 
1993 to finance solutions to environmental problems caused by 
industrial development along the border. 
  The problems and backwardness in environmental technology, 
equipment, and information sectors, particularly evident at the 
country's northern border, are not new within an international 
context.

introduction] 
  [Text] Researchers and industrialists who are partners in a 
French- Algerian program for scientific cooperation in the area 
of used water treatment will meet on 21 January at the French 
National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Montpellier to 
assess their work. 
  Focusing on establishing efficient, innovative technologies 
and the training of national specialists in Algeria through a 
knowledge transfer, this program, after two years in existence, 
was found to have yielded a "very positive" outcome by the 
CNRS's Languedoc-Roussillon regional delegation. The delegation, 
in a communique sent Friday to APS, found that "original 
solutions have been found to treat effluents from the National 
Cellulose and Paper Industry's [CELPAP] pulp paper plant in 
Baba-Ali, near Algiers" and that "about 15 internships have been 
served in Montpellier by Algerian engineers." 
  "This effort," the delegation added, "which is aimed at 
implementing new membrane technologies to remove the pollution 
from the water supplies of the countries of the Maghreb and at 
the fight against pollution in the Mediterrean, has been 
strengthened by another cooperative program financed by the 
European Community between the Montpellier teams and the 
Algerian (especially from the National Polytechnic and 
Houari-Boumediene University) and Moroccan (University of Fes) 
teams." 
  According to the CNRS's regional delegation, "the success of 
this cooperation is based on the sharing by numerous agencies 
(universities, research agencies, and industrialists)" and it 
emphasized "the importance of the specific progress made in 
Montpellier in the area of membrane technologies." 
  These programs, based on the principle of partnership and 
shared objectives, reflect the spirit and the organization of 
scientific cooperation with countries on the southern rim of the 
Mediterranean as envisioned by the CNRS and reflect the 
willingness of that agency to strengthen relations with the 
industrial sector.

  [Text] New Delhi -- Former vice chairman of Planning 
Commission Mohan Dharia, who is currently heading Vanarai, 
people's movement for a green India, has alerted Prime Minister 
P.V. Narasimha Rao of moves by certain vested interests to 
secure forest land for growing raw material for industries. 
  The disclosure made during an international workshop on 
India's forest management and ecological revival, have spurred 
Dharia to write to the Prime Minister and seek his intervention 
in attempts to dilute the forest policy. 
  "Raw material required for paper or wood industry should be 
produced on private lands and valuable forests reserved for 
permanent green cover and natural biosphere," Dharia says. 
  Most of the wastelands in the country belong to individuals 
and with farm forestry, it is possible to make them productive. 
"In view of the great threat to our environment, I am sure you 
will not deviate from the earlier policy of the Government on 
forests. Environmentalists in the country are opposed to the 
move to hand over forest lands to industry," says Dharia.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpt] Fifty highly polluting industrial units, 26 of 
them from the public sector, that have failed to install 
pollution abatement measures have been let off the hook after a 
Cabinet meeting presided by the Prime Minister. 
  In January 1991 the Environment and Forest Ministry had 
identified 17 categories of industries that caused maximum 
pollution in the country and 1,551 industrial units set up prior 
to 1981, were asked to install pollution control equipment and 
bring down emissions in air and water to the standards 
prescribed. The deadline was December 31 1993. 
  At a meeting this January, it was pointed out that about 50 
industries had not even begun to implement the order. Among them 
were 14 sugar units, five distilleries, four cement plants, four 
thermal plants, four leather and two pharmaceutical units. Of 
the 50 defaulting units, 23 were in Andhra. 
  Within the Ministry itself, there were differences as to 
whether a few of these firms should be shut down to show the 
Ministry's determination, or whether the ministry should just 
continue to flex its muscles, since closure would throw 
thousands of workers out of a job. 
  The matter was finally taken to Cabinet, which ruled out the 
closure of any industry since it could cause large-scale 
unemployment. Chief Ministers also opposed the closure move. 
Several units, it was pointed out, were sick and there was no 
money even to resuscitate them. 
  Orissa Chief Minister Biju Patnaik argued that the polluting 
thermal power plant at Talcher was set up in 1952, long before 
the pollution laws were introduced. He said 2,500 people would 
lose jobs if just this one unit was closed. The State would also 
suffer for want of power. Since isolated polluting industries in 
rural areas did less harm than polluting units in urban 
industrial clusters, they should be shown leniency, he argued. 
  Now, the state pollution control boards have been asked to 
prosecute these units under the Environment Protection Act for 
not complying with standards set. Ironically, the penalty will 
not be for failing to install pollution control measures but for 
not complying with the standards prescribed for emissions. The 
sentence could be five years imprisonment or a fine of Rs 
[rupees] 1 lakh or both. 
  However, it is pertinent to point out that the official 
dealing with these cases in the ministry could not recall a 
single case of successful prosecution of such industrial units. 
Industrial units that do not have funds to install pollution 
control equipment, do manage to raise resources to fight the 
litigation. 
  The chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board Dilip 
Biswas has asked state boards to: 
  1) verify wilful defaulters of the 17 highly polluting 
industries; 
  2) determine the time required by each units for completion 
of pollution control programme on case to case basis and give a 
time frame not exceeding six months; 
  3) take immediate action against wilful defaulters.

  [Text] Yet another environmental problem has hit the 
already badly affected Russia. Environmentally dangerous waste 
from the rich Western Europe is being dumped in Russia. The 
waste is exported as recyclable but in actual fact it is 
unusable poison, says Russian Greenpeace. 
  Russian Greenpeace spokesman Dima Litvinov: "Now 
they are looking to Russia and other parts of the former Soviet 
Union as a good place where they can get rid of their waste." 
  Correspondent: This is Dima Litvinov, one of the 
Russian Greenpeace activists who have warned against this 
development, that Western Europe is beginning to dump its 
dangerous waste in Eastern Europe. 
  Russian Greenpeace has just discovered 16 train carriages 
standing unprotected in a railway siding in the Orenburg area in 
the region bordering on Kazakhstan. The railway carriages hold 
1,200 tonnes of waste from Germany and France. The waste 
contains poisons, including cadmium and arsenic. The waste has 
been sold as raw material for the region's nickel industry but 
it is totally useless. Because of the dangerous cargo, the 
Russian railways refuse to have anything to do with the 
carriages any longer and the authorities have not found anyone 
willing to receive the dangerous cargo. Right now most of the 
cargo is frozen, but soon spring will arrive, melting it, and a 
catastrophe will not then be far away, says Dima Litvinov. 
  Litvinov: "There is a huge risk that if nothing is 
done with this material, there will be a real disaster in the 
area." 
  Correspondent: What might actually happen? 
  Litvinov: "If the material gets into the drinking 
water tables it is certain that the people in the city will 
become ill, they may have to be evacuated. I don't know whether 
it can be calculated now how many might die from it." 
  Correspondent: Although the so-called Basle 
Convention bans export of waste that is dangerous to the 
environment, the convention makes an exception for waste that 
may be defined as recyclable. As early as next week, this 
export is to be discussed in Geneva, and several West European 
countries, led by Denmark, have demanded a tightening of the 
convention so that there will be no repetition of the case 
involving the railway carriages in Orenburg.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Mikhail </F>
Karlov] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The dumping of liquid 
radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan by vessels of the 
Pacific Fleet will only be carried out with the permission of 
the Russian Government. The Russian Naval Forces press center 
said this today in response to a request by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent for a comment on a report by the Japanese paper 
MAINICHI. 
  The paper reported today, citing Valeriy Danilyan, the chief 
of the Pacific Fleet Chemical Service, that Russia could resume 
the dumping of waste in the Sea of Japan in May this year unless 
foreign countries, including Japan, provided financial help with 
building facilities to use and store liquid radioactive waste. 
The Russian Naval Forces press center said that this was the 
personal view of one of the Pacific Fleet leaders. However, the 
government has so far not taken a decision on the dumping of 
waste in the Sea of Japan. [passage omitted: background to the 
problem that blew up in October 1993] 
  Only the use of special facilities for rendering the waste 
harmless can solve the problem. A Finance Ministry 
representative recently said at a session of a government 
commission that the issue of allocating money for these problems 
will be resolved very soon. 
  It should be noted that Russia has not received the help 
promised by Western countries for the construction of the 
facilities. And the tanker for the storage and transportation 
of radioactive waste offered by Japan turned out to be wholly 
unsuitable for use.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Polutov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 10 Mar -- TOKYO SHIMBUN is the first 
foreign news organization to be allowed to report on a 
dismantling plant for nuclear-powered submarines in the Russian 
Far East. This plant is known to be the source of radioactive 
waste dumped into the Japan Sea last October, and we were 
allowed to take photos of submarines being dismantled. The 
plant was filled with about 300 containers of solid nuclear 
waste, and it was obvious the plant's storage capacity was 
reaching its limits. 
  Last month, Russia refused to accept the new London 
Convention, which prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste 
into the sea. The submarine dismantling plant is facing 
difficulties in continuing its operations due to a surplus of 
radioactive waste. Therefore, the plant is calling for the 
resumption of dumping of radioactive waste. 
  "Zvezda (Star)" plant is located in Borshoy-Kamen Bay, 120 
kilometers east of Vladivostok. The plant was founded in 1954 
as a dock for warships and submarines, but is currently 
dismantling superannuated nuclear-powered submarines which were 
scrapped one after another during the past several years. 
  Unauthorized entry to the plant is strictly forbidden, and 
the gate is guarded by security authorities. The plant is 
divided into A and B zones, and when this correspondent visited 
the facility, a "Delta-1" class (displacement: 9,000 tons) was 
being disassembled in A zone. Both the bow and the stern of the 
Delta-1 were sliced off, and the body was placed in a dock as if 
it were a huge sausage. Its missile launcher used to be a great 
threat to the Western nations, but it has now been reduced to a 
pile of scrap iron. Compared to the beautifully streamlined 
shapes of Russian submarines, of which this correspondent is 
familiar, the heap of scrap iron looked miserable. 
  Director Maslakov said that the Zvezda plant had already 
dismantled five nuclear submarines. He added that the plant 
currently has four submarines to dismantle, but two of them are 
still untouched. 
  Since the Russian Pacific Fleet has discontinued its dumping 
of solid nuclear waste from 1990, about 300 containers (with a 
capacity of 1.5 cubic meters each) of solid nuclear waste have 
been stored in the plant. The dumping of liquid nuclear waste 
was also suspended last fall due to criticism from the 
international community. The liquid waste tankers "TNT-5" and 
"TNT-27" were moored at a pier near the plant, but they were 
said to be full of liquid waste. 
  Explaining the seriousness of the current situation, 
Director 
Maslakov stated: "This plant is just like a man without a 
kidney. The dismantling of nuclear submarines cannot continue 
without the disposal of nuclear waste. If the plant stops its 
operations, the Pacific Fleet would become unable to carry on 
its normal duties, which may cause social unrest." 
  To say nothing of the budget to build new disposal 
facilities, the plant cannot afford to pay wages to its 
employees. Director Maslakov said "the resumption of nuclear 
waste dumping is inevitable unless Japan and other Western 
nations offer funds for constructing (nuclear waste disposal 
facilities)."

  [Text] Chemical weapons lost their significance after the 
appearance of the atomic bomb. However, their production is 
continuing in Russia, a fact which threatens the ecology. Lev 
Fedorov, a scientist and chemist, made this declaration 
intending to cause a sensation, on the occasion of presenting 
his book "Chemical Weapons in Russia: History, Ecology, 
Politics." 
  In the scientific work which he presented, Doctor of 
Chemical 
Sciences Fedorov makes public a survey of the events connected 
with the activities of the military-chemical complex, whose 
secrets have traditionally been held "behind seven seals." 
  The book is full of sensations. In particular, the scientist 
asserts that there are about 100 geographic regions in Russia, 
where it is a threat to one's life and health to live, as a 
result of the production, testing or storage of toxic substances 
for military use.

  [Text] In Russia, radioactive waste has been leaking from 
tankers, and the storage of radioactive waste is in a dangerous 
state. The Russian Pacific Fleet has made a request for 
Japanese Government financial aid to construct ground facilities 
for its storage. The request was conveyed during an interview 
with two officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet by NHK's 
Vladivostok bureau. [begin recording] 
  Danilyan, captain 1st rank, chief of the Radioactive 
and Chemical Defense Operations Department: Since this is a 
decommissioned tanker, we suspect that what we already have are 
micro leaks. In other words, radioactive waste leaks out and 
settles on the bottom of Bolshoy Kamen Bay. We suspect this is 
so. [end recording]. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Chishisenko, captain 1st rank, chief engineer of the 
Technology Bureau: Therefore, we believe the waste should 
be transferred to other containers in the shortest time 
possible. [end recording]. 
  In connection with this, the Russian Pacific Fleet plans to 
construct by May this year ground facilities to store liquid 
radioactive waste at Sysoyevo Bay in the eastern part of 
Vladivostok, and other ground facilities to dispose of 
radioactive waste at Bolshoy Kamen Bay where tankers are 
presently berthed. 
  The Russian Pacific Fleet, which estimates the cost of 
constructing the facilities at around $50 million, wants the 
Japanese Government to provide financial aid. The Russian 
Pacific Fleet feels a strong sense of crisis as the Russian 
Government is not showing any eagerness to use funds from Japan 
to resolve the radioactive storage issue. 
  The request comes shortly before Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's 19 March visit to Moscow. It is believed to be aimed at 
explaining the situation to the Japanese Government before he 
arrives in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Romanova: "Review of Ecological Situation </F>
in 1993; No Reason for Optimism"] 
  [Text] Around 33,000 specialists and academics are working 
for the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources (Minprirody), including the 630 members of the central 
staff. These seemingly high figures are not that impressive, 
because ecologists are responsible for drafting legislative 
instruments and administrative ordinances and for monitoring and 
evaluating environmental conditions in various parts of the 
country. 
  The conclusions everyone has drawn from the results for 1993 
are not optimistic. Ecological conditions are still growing 
worse. In addition to the decline of technological discipline at 
many enterprises, there is the low rate of retooling, the 
reduced allocations for environmental construction and 
renovation projects, and the use of substandard types of fuel. 
Ecological conditions are still at the critical point in 44 
cities in the country (Moscow, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Bratsk, and others). In just the first half of 1993, 207 cases 
of pollution levels 10 or more times in excess of allowable 
limits were recorded here. There has been no decrease in the 
total number of accidents or in the ecologically harmful 
emissions of industrial and agricultural facilities and public 
utilities. The operations of more than 120 enterprises, shops, 
units, and facilities were halted (temporarily) for violations 
of water conservation laws. 
  Specialists are still particularly concerned about the 
radiological conditions throughout the country, and especially 
in the areas surrounding facilities of the nuclear complex. 
Mobile sources of pollution are creating additional problems: 
The total quantity of harmful vehicle emissions has increased 
dramatically, and this is certainly connected with the increase 
in the number of vehicle owners who will not stop driving even 
in winter. Some species of animals and fish have been reduced to 
the critical point as a result of the deterioration of their 
habitats and the higher number of poachers. 
  One of the problems inhibiting effective Minprirody 
operations, according to Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, is 
the flawed legal base. Many necessary laws simply do not exist, 
and those which have been passed are frequently contradictory. 
The failure to draw clear distinctions between the functions of 
central and regional agencies has led to the proverbial 
situation in which "too many cooks are spoiling the soup." 
  As Danilov-Danilyan said at the final collegial meeting of 
Minprirody, departmental specialists drafted 44 presidential 
edicts last year and coordinated 42 draft legal instruments 
received from other organizations. Subdivisions of the state 
Board of Environmental Impact Appraisals reviewed 64,000 
pre-planning and planning documents of various types and 
standardizing documents. These impressive figures include the 
fundamentals of Russian Federation water, land, and forest 
legislation, draft laws "On Lake Baykal," "On Ecological 
Security," and "On Oil and Gas," and the "Fundamentals of RF 
Legislation on Flora." Their future, however, now depends on the 
new parliament, which is unlikely to consider these bills until 
it has "scrutinized" some political matters and has scored 
additional privileges for its members. 
  Finances are another of the ecologists' concerns. According 
to Danilov-Danilyan, ecological policy should be coordinated 
with economic reforms. The amount allocated to finance all of 
the operations of Minprirody organizations in 1993 was 22.6 
billion rubles, which was equivalent to 83.2 percent of the 
amount agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance and just over 
half of the estimated cost of these operations. 
  The 30 programs of environmental recovery and several dozen 
programs of regional, oblast, territorial, and municipal 
socioeconomic development are based on the scientific and 
technical program called "Russia's Ecological Security." The 
implementation of this plan, however, might be disrupted because 
the financing has been cut to just about one-third of the 
original amount. Only 2.6 billion of the 6.87 billion rubles was 
allocated in 1993. 
  The required amounts are minimal on the national scale and 
are within the limits of the error built into the state budget. 
"Ecological allocations are not this low in any other country in 
the world. That is why the unsatisfactory state of our 
environment is not surprising. Under these conditions, there is 
no hope of improvement," the minister has repeatedly pointed out. 
  In spite of this, six natural preserves (with a total area 
of 
8 million hectares) were established last year, and the plans 
were drawn up for seven more, which should be established this 
year. Ecologists have calculated that around 40 percent of 
Russia's territory (7-8 million square kilometers) is unaffected 
by economic activity, except for the planes flying overhead. 
This "ecological gold mine" must be protected from industrial 
inroads. As a result of the work on the plans for the sound 
network of state natural preserves and national parks, these 
territories (along with the 77 existing preserves, with an area 
of 27 million hectares) will cover 53.6 million hectares, or 
3.12 percent of the area of the Russian Federation, by 2005. 
  Six new maritime inspection boards were also created for the 
protection of the resources of the Russian Federation's 
territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic 
zone, which are under unequivocal federal jurisdiction. Because 
of the inadequate equipment of these inspection boards, however, 
the state of Russia's maritime resources and their ecologically 
acceptable use are being monitored on an area of only 900,000 
square kilometers, or only 13 percent of the total. It is 
possible that the Minprirody treasury will be supplemented 
slightly by unpaid fines and pending claims amounting to 7 
million rubles and just over 500 million rubles respectively. 
  Figures of this size are unlikely to intimidate large 
enterprises. It is often simpler and more convenient for them to 
pay the fines than to change their technology, install sewage 
treatment equipment, etc. Money and the profit motive are the 
deciding factors in a market economy. This is why Minprirody 
plans to continue developing environmental and conservation tax 
benefits, instituting preferential customs duties for operations 
connected with environmental activity, and developing market 
mechanisms promoting the prudent use of resources on different 
levels (the federation, the region, and the enterprise). It will 
also finish setting standards to regulate environmental impact 
studies in privatization projects and in the collection of 
environmental damages caused by industrial accidents. Standard 
fees will be set for radioactive pollution. Experiments will be 
conducted with regional ecological insurance and with improved 
economic mechanisms in territories under special protection. 
  Viktor Danilov-Danilyan is determined to take action. It is 
possible that he now has a partner in Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the 
government curator of the ecological establishment, who already 
attended a Minprirody collegial meeting. In any case, he is 
certain to take a special interest in the group of "land" 
problems.

  The Fundamental Provisions of the Russian Federation State 
Strategy of Environmental Protection and Sustained Development 
will serve as the basis for constructive interaction by 
government agencies of the Russian Federation and its members, 
agencies of local self-government, businessmen, and public 
associations in the comprehensive resolution of problems in the 
balanced development of the economy and improvement of 
environmental conditions. 
  The pursuit of the Russian Federation state strategy of 
environmental protection and sustained development will 
presuppose the exercise of the right guaranteed to citizens by 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation to a healthy 
environment and the right of future generations to make use of 
natural resource potential for continued stable development, as

combination with the necessary measures to protect and improve 
the environment and conserve and restore natural resources. 
<H3>  1. The Guarantee of Ecologically Safe and Sustained 
Development Under the Conditions of Market Relations </H3>
  Government regulation of resource use and the stimulation of 
environmental activity by means of purposeful socioeconomic, 
financial, and tax policies under the conditions of developing 
market relations will be conducted to secure ecologically safe 
and sustained development. The goal of economic activity will be 
economic prosperity combined with the ecological safety of 
Russia. 
  The fundamental guidelines of activity to secure 
ecologically 
safe and sustained development will be the following: 
  the ecologically sound distribution of productive forces; 
  the ecologically safe development of industry, power 
engineering, transportation, and public utilities; 
  the ecologically safe development of agriculture; 
  the conservation of renewable natural resources; 
  the prudent use of non-renewable natural resources; 
  the broader use of secondary resources and the recycling, 
decontamination, and disposal of waste; 
  the improvement of management in the sphere of environmental 
protection, resource use, and the emergency warning and 
prevention network. 
<H5>  2. The Protection of the Human Habitat </H5>

Ecologically Inferior Regions of Russia </H3>
  The following are the fundamental guidelines of activity for 
the purpose of eliminating the increasingly acute conflicts 
between the development of productive forces and the maintenance 
of an ecological balance in regions with unfavorable 
environmental conditions and securing the natural development of 
ecosystems and the preservation and restoration of unique 
natural complexes and landscapes during the resolution of 
territorial economic problems with the best possible methods of 
resource use and environmental protection: 
  the rectification of the critical ecological conditions in 
several large cities and industrial centers; 
  the alleviation of the after-effects of the radioactive 
pollution of territories; 
  the preservation of the natural complex of the Lake Baykal 
basin;

<F P=106> [Text of Minprirody of Russia press service announcement </F>
"Greenpeace, To Put It Mildly, Is Wrong"; with commentary] 
  [Text] In late 1993 the Russian branch of Greenpeace 
distributed a report entitled "Russia: "A Dump for Western 
Wastes." Following that articles with similar content appeared 
in the Russian mass information media. 
  In connection with this, the press service of Minprirody 
[Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources] is 
authorized to announce that the allegation that Russia has 
already become a proving ground for disposing of dangerous 
industrial wastes from Western countries has no basis at all and 
is pure disinformation. 
  The data cited in the Greenpeace report stating that in 6 
years 96 attempts were made to import 34 million tonnes of waste 
to Russia illustrate only intentions and nothing more. Attempts 
made are not yet accomplished facts which constitute a real 
threat to Russia's ecological security. 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  As experience accumulated has shown, the system for 
exporting 
and importing industrial waste which operates in our country 
does not do a reliable job of insuring us against the 
infiltration of large batches of dangerous waste into Russia's 
territory. According to the decree of the government, MBES 
[Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of Russia issues the 
licenses and the State Customs Committee monitors the import of 
waste. The basis for issuing a license is the agreement of 
Minprirody of Russia, which conducts the necessary expert 
ecological study in such cases. This system applies to all 
subjects of economic activity on Russia's territory, and the 
violation of it entails administrative and criminal 
responsibility. 
  According to Minprirody data, the territorial nature 
protection organs have rejected the overwhelming majority of 
proposals of Western firms and Russian intermediary firms on the 
basis of the findings of expert ecological studies. 
  In 1992-1993 they approved licenses to import only small 
batches of industrial waste, largely for research purposes (for 
example, 130 kilograms of polymer waste -- the Mikas AG Joint 
Stock Company, 800 kilograms of automobile scrap -- the 
Association of Engineering Research, and so forth). In addition, 
licenses to import about 50,000 tonnes of waste from Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan were permitted to be issued. But that is another 
subheading, as they say. These wastes (metallurgical tailings 
and granular slag) serve as raw material for Russia's cement 
enterprises and have been supplied to Russia within the 
framework of cooperation since the days of the former USSR and, 
most importantly, are not classified as dangerous wastes. 
  Data from the Greenpeace report which was already mentioned 
are more evidence of the effectiveness of the present system; 
according to the report 4,000 tonnes of waste and 7,500 old 
tires have been disposed of in Russia in the last 6 years, and 
that is 8,500 times, meaning almost to the fourth order, less 
than those 34 million tonnes which were indicated as attempted 
imports. 
  For your information: every year about 25 million tonnes of 
dangerous waste are formed in the OECD [Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development] countries and more than 
200 million tonnes -- in the United States. 
  Incidentally, it is appropriate to mention that the 
radioactive waste which figures as a component of this 4,000 
tonnes represents spent nuclear fuel from atomic power plants 
built by the Soviet Union and is imported to Russia under 
existing agreements to which Article 50 of the Law "On 
Protecting the Natural Environment" does not retroactively 
apply. So one should not be too hasty and "ring the bell before 
looking at the church calendar." 
  In order to stop the illegal attempts to import dangerous 
waste, the danger of which cannot be underestimated, Minprirody 
is working in close contact with law enforcement organs as well 
as the nature protection departments of Latvia, Poland, Germany, 
and a number of other countries. 
  Taking into account the ever-increasing desire of foreign 
firms to increase waste imports, including dangerous waste, into 
Russia, Minprirody of Russia has prepared a packet of documents 
needed to ratify the Basel Convention and a draft decree of the 
RF Government which, among other things, envisions compiling a 
list of wastes whose import onto Russia's territory must be 
prohibited. 
  Let us say in conclusion that an objective evaluation of the 
real state of affairs fundamentally refutes Greenpeace's theory 
that Russia has been converted into a dump for Western waste. 
This once again illustrates Greenpeace's inadequate 
understanding of the essence of Russian ecological problems, 
which brings to mind that this organization's choice of 
priorities was made in advance, rather than dictated by Russia's 
interests. 
  However, sharing the concern of public organizations and the 
mass information media over foreign firms' attempts to import 
dangerous wastes into Russia, Minprirody of Russia invites them 
to participate in cooperation and a mutual exchange of 
information on the attempts made for this purpose in order to 
set up a double barrier, state and public, against dangerous 
wastes.

<F P=106> [Text, under the rubric "Living Environment," of excerpts </F>
from the Green Peace Report "Russia: A Dump for Western Wastes. 
1987-1993"; with commentary by Ye. Subbotina] 
  [Text] "Russia: A Dump for Western Wastes. 
1987-1993." That is what the special report of Greenpeace of 
Russia is called. Its purpose is to make public transactions 
involving trade in wastes and their disposal in Russia. 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA decided to publish excerpts from this 
report. 
  As Greenpeace has found out, in the period from 1987 through 
November 1993, 95 firms made 86 attempts to export 34 million 
tonnes of dangerous waste from Western Europe to Russia's 
territory. Most of the proposals originated in Germany, but 
export attempts were also made by Switzerland, Austria, the 
United States, Italy, France, Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, 
Portugal, and Sweden. More than half the attempts were made by 
German firms and 80 percent of the waste (28 million tonnes) was 
produced in Germany. 
  Waste dealers most often use the pretext of "processing" or 
"recycling" to justify exports and take advantage of loopholes 
in laws which allow export for the purpose of processing with a 
minimum of monitoring. These proposals on processing presuppose 
either operations presented in an altogether false light or 
extremely dirty ones which would be illegal in the exporting 
country. 
  In this report alone, 90 percent of the schemes for 
exporting 
radioactive waste, whose future fate is well-known, were 
implemented under the pretext of "recycling." Greenpeace asserts 
that the economic incentive for exporting waste to less 
developed countries is so great that if a justification such as 
"processing" is the only way to export waste, all the waste 
dealers will become "processing specialists." 
  In fact, of the 96 proposals for importing waste made to 
Russia, 13 deal with garbage burning plants and "processing" 
enterprises. 
  Among the proposed wastes were 12 million tonnes of waste 
water sludge and contaminated soil, 10 million tonnes of slag 
and ashes from garbage burning plants, more than 700,000 tonnes 
of metallurgical waste, cable fragments, filtered dust, old 
paint, pesticides, chemicals, used tires, and plastic and 
radioactive waste. 
  There were 4,000 tonnes of waste successfully transported 
and 
disposed of on Russia's territory, including radioactive waste, 
used catalytic converters, mercury waste, copper slag, old 
pesticides, paint, chemicals, plastic, and 7,500 old tires. 
  In the opinion of Greenpeace, the figures cited give an idea 
of merely the tip of the iceberg of waste which is more and more 
regularly imported to Russia's territory. Greenpeace is afraid 
that present conditions will merely help turn Russia into a 
colony for dumping waste from Western Europe if the export and 
import of waste is not immediately banned. 
  These conditions are developing from the lack of bans on 
exports in the Western exporting countries and the crisis 
situation in Russia's economy, where the desire to obtain hard 
currency and the predominance among new entrepreneurs of a 
mentality which can be described as "take everything while you 
still can," as well as the lack of clarity in legislative and 
administrative structures, corruption on all levels, and our 
vast territory promote the export of waste to our country. 
  A provision completely banning the export of dangerous 
waste, 
including waste intended for "processing," from the OECD 
[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] 
countries to countries which are not OECD members must be 
included in the laws of Germany and the European Economic 
Community and in the Basel Convention. 
  Moreover, many Western countries are more prepared to impose 
a ban on the export of waste to the developing countries than on 
the export of waste to the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, 
which are not considered developing countries. Such a choice, 
which makes it possible to turn a country such as Russia, which 
is undergoing a serious economic and ecological crisis, into a 
dump, is immoral. Russia has enough of its own ecological 
problems. Aggravating them with waste from the West means 
sacrificing Russia as an international dump. That, moreover, 
frees the West of the need to introduce clean production instead 
of toxic technologies which promote the production of harmful 
wastes. Political intervention is now needed to set up a ban on 
trade in wastes. 
<H5>  Dirty Business </H5>
  Waste elimination has become an extremely profitable sector 
of the economy, and new regulations combined with the rapid 
reduction in capacities to eliminate waste merely promote higher 
prices. In order to avoid expenditures, a whole army of 
consultants, brokers, and waste-shipping companies has created a 
developed industry for handling waste which is called the "waste 
trade." This is the principle of its operation: the broker 
proposes to a company to remove dangerous waste at prices lower 
that existing ones for eliminating waste. Next the broker places 
the waste in a rented warehouse. Then he begins to look for 
somewhere to put the waste in another state whose government 
consents to it and where it can be done free of charge or at 
nominal cost. Very often officials receive bribes to do this. 
  Frequently the middlemen try to sell the importing country 
equipment to eliminate the waste -- a garbage burning plant or 
facility for disposing of the waste which supposedly meets 
Western standards. 
  Waste exporters prefer to do business with countries where 
the ecology movement is less influential, the laws less strict, 
and the leadership and executive branch of power have a shortage 
of resources as a result of lower development and sometimes even 
a crisis in the economy. 
<H5>  Disposal Under a Different Name </H5>
  In the 1980's most waste dealers did not attempt to hide the 
main purpose of their operations -- to get rid of dangerous 
waste. Now, however, "processing" or "recycling" is almost 
always mentioned as a pretext for transporting waste from 
countries with a more developed economy to countries with a less 
developed economy. Greenpeace has been a witness to innumerable 
justifications for the waste trade done under the guise of 
"processing," "humanitarian aid," "energy reduction," and 
"transfer of technology." Many of those who are involved in 
"processing" receive most of the profits from the very act of 
accepting waste for its "removal." "Processing" specialists 
receive money for accepting waste, since it is well known that 
waste is dangerous. Inasmuch as it is prohibited to discharge or 
burn an ever-increasing number of types of waste, the processing 
procedures are considered a new means to get rid of waste in 
industry. 
  Instead of preventing the production of dangerous waste, it 
is processed. When harmful waste is processed, it remains, 
damaging human health. 
<H5>  First Africa, Then Eastern Europe </H5>
  In the 1980's the African continent became the first victim 
of the trade in toxins. In 1988 dozens of cases of such exports 
became known and appeared in the headlines of the world press. 
As a result, the African countries condemned the import of waste 
and imposed a ban on it. When it became clear to the waste 
dealers that Africa was under control, they left to seek other 
large areas in order to dispose of the waste. 
  In Eastern Europe Poland became the first country to suffer: 
Poland was the first to open up her borders to the independent 
activity of Western firms. In 1989 the leaders of Solidarity 
adopted legislation which prohibited the import of any waste. 
The Polish government managed to bring the problem under 
control. According to Greenpeace data, starting in 1991 the 
waste brought to Poland has been transferred to the Baltic 
states, Romania, Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Ukraine, 
and, quite recently, Russia. 
  It is now clear that the countries of Western Europe intend 
to use the states of Eastern Europe as colonies where waste and 
dangerous materials are sent for "processing." 
<H5>  The Victim Is Russia </H5>
  The Russian market is extremely attractive to Western 
middlemen because of the difference in prices for removing waste 
from the West and to Russia. Because of this difference, 
enormous profits may be obtained. The privatization of former 
state enterprises and the lack of efficient official monitoring 
have led to an unchecked desire to obtain profits at any cost, 
without thinking of society or the environment. In post-Soviet 
society, after they lost official power, the former power 
structures began to seek new ways to support a high standard of 
living using completely self-centered and at times even criminal 
methods. 
  Another problem is related to the political decentralization 
of the decision making process. As a result decisions are made 
by people who do not have a clear idea of the political and 
global ecological consequences of such decisions. 
<H5>  The Import of Waste to Russia -- the Tip of the Iceberg </H5>
  Greenpeace took the material for this report from German, 
Russian, and other international sources. There is no doubt of 
the fact that the attempts to import waste presented in the 
report are merely the tip of the iceberg of what is called the 
"import of waste," and a large number of the precedents have not 
been publicized. 
  Not one country, with the exception of Poland (in Central 
and 
Eastern Europe), offers data on the waste trade. 
  Representatives of "power" structures like the KGB and of 
the 
criminal world often work on the staff of firms involved in the 
waste trade. 
  Because of Russia's disastrous financial condition, the 
danger arises that an increasing number of waste dealers will 
rush to this region in search of new markets for their dirty 
business. This danger can be averted by imposing a ban on the 
waste trade in the exporting countries and in Russia. 
<H5>  Commentary by Ye. Subbotina </H5>
  The Greenpeace report speaks of terrible things. Africa has 
rebuffed those who wanted to turn the continent into a poisonous 
dump. Russia has offered up its neck and the international mafia 
of waste dealers is making the noose tighter and tighter. A 
big-time game is being played with the difference in prices: in 
Germany eliminating 1 tonne of household waste costs 300 German 
marks, 1 tonne of solvents -- 1,200, and 1 tonne of pesticides 
-- 11,000 German marks, while burying them in Russia costs 35 
marks a tonne! And when there is the smell of such large amounts 
of money... 
  Waste comes to Russia by rail and by sea and ocean. Plastic 
waste from the United States arrived in St. Petersburg in 
November of the year before last. The garbage was shipped to the 
Intertreyd firm (a Russian firm) which is no longer in 
existence. The fire in Orekhovo-Zuyevo received a great deal of 
publicity when the inhabitants of that city in the Moscow region 
began to choke from the acrid smoke. Very labored breathing, 
headaches, and vomiting were caused by the waste which was 
scattered about the grounds of one of the enterprises. These 
items came from Germany to the Moscow scientific production 
association Plastik and the limited partnership Sirin in 
December 1992. The waste was cellulose and the plastic contained 
lethal components -- arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead. It is 
noteworthy that another 100 tonnes of this same waste found 
refuge in Chelyabinsk. It has not yet caught fire there. 
  And how costly just one offer to dump 12 million tonnes of 
waste water sludge in Russia is! Those who imagine that we have 
little of our own sludge should just take a drive to Maryino: a 
"deposit" of 20 million tonnes is located there in very close 
proximity to residential dwellings. Moscow has been racking its 
brains for a long time over what to do with it. The poison is 
terrible and there is simply nowhere to take it. 
  It is clear that to avoid becoming a world dump, Russia must 
stand up for its vital interests in the most decisive way. No 
considerations of financial benefit can be taken into account: 
ultimately it will have to be paid for in human lives. Of 
course, this will be a blow to the hairy paws of the mafia, but 
we have no other choice. Consequently, we need a program of 
tough measures by law enforcement organs. Laws to prevent the 
penetration of any waste across the border must be passed and, 
of course, we must try to insert a provision into the Basel 
Convention completely banning the import of poison to Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Frolov, report on population's health with </F>
table on cancer mortality rate, and report on counterfeit 
therapeutic balms by A. I. Leontyev, under the rubric "House of 
Nature": "The White Book of Moscow"] 
  [Text] The White Book "State Report on the Condition of 
the Natural Environment of the City of Moscow" has been 
published for the first time in the city's history. 
  The report was prepared by decision No. 18 of the presidium 
of the Mossovet dated 15 April 1993. The client was 
Moskomprirody [Moscow Nature Committee] and the chief agent was 
the Moscow Special Purpose Fund "Ecology and the Condition of 
the Living Environment" (MTsF ESSO ["Moskovskiy tselevoy fond 
`Ekologiya i sostoyaniye sredy obitaniya'"]. The chairman of the 
editorial board was A. V. Yablokov. 
  For decades the city's nature protection organs maintained a 
humble silence regarding the activity of the city authorities 
and the Council of Ministers nomenklatura, who turned Moscow 
into an ecological disaster zone. 
  This humility cost Muscovites dearly -- millions of 
residents 
have died 8-10 years early and hundreds of thousands of children 
have been born with birth defects and pathologies. 
  This humility cost the state dearly too -- each person who 
died early or became disabled could have benefited society. Just 
the cost of treatment and sick leave eats up hundreds of 
billions of rubles. 
  This humility left the managers of hundreds of small 
"Chernobyl's" which contaminated the city unpunished and doomed 
any good ecological programs to failure for a lack of objective 
information. 
  But now the first breach has appeared in the wall of silence 
-- the White Book of Moscow, which for the first time makes it 
possible to assess the condition of the living environment and 
the population's health both for the city as a whole and by 
individual zones. 
  There is no reason to retell the report's content. Suffice 
it 
to say that the report includes chapters which characterize the 
natural conditions in the city, the condition of the atmospheric 
air, water resources, soils, and the plant and animal worlds, 
the scope of technogenic impact, radiation, noise, and 
electromagnetic pollution, technogenic changes in the geological 
milieu, the state of public health, and the activity of the 
nature protection organizations. The report includes more than 
40 maps and figures which for the first time make it possible to 
comprehensively assess the condition of the living environment. 
  I am certain that every Muscovite will be interested to know 
the report's contents and find out just what is happening in his 
microrayon and on his street. 
  But the history of the report's appearance is no less 
interesting. 
  First, the report appeared against the bureaucrats' wishes. 
The city administration deliberately did absolutely nothing to 
prepare it, hoping that the idea would die of itself. A 
paradoxical fact is that the State Report was financed not from 
the city budget but at the expense of the City Ecology Fund. 
Only the sincere enthusiasm and the unselfishness, rare in our 
times, of the researchers enabled this unique publication to be 
prepared. 
  They were able to defend the principle that it is first of 
all the performing organization that determines the report's 
content; and that organization was MTSF "ESSO," which hired such 
organizations as MGU [Moscow State University], MosTsGMS, IMGRE 
[Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Crystallochemistry 
of Rare Elements], VIMS [All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Mineral Raw Materials], GMPP of Aerogeology, MGTs 
SEN, NIiPI Genplana, Geoekotsentr [Geoecocenter], and others, in 
all more than 20 organizations. In preparing the report they 
managed to avoid nomenklatura censorship or being placed under 
the eye of the latest city "father." 
  Taking into account the trend toward restoration of the 
nomenklatura dictatorship in Russia, it is quite possible that 
the report will become a bibliographic rarity. One may predict 
that subsequent reports, if they are prepared, will be done with 
proper humility. 
  Of course, the report was no great revelation. It once again 
used the example of Moscow to prove that the condition of the 
environment is the dirtiest secret of the obsolete totalitarian 
state. But the report gives an objective and fairly frightening 
picture of the party-management nomenklatura's genocide against 
its own people. 
  Much of what was intended in the report was not 
accomplished. 
The trends toward change in the condition of the environment 
were not followed for a long period of time, a substantiated 
prediction of the possible consequences of maintaining the 
present attitude toward nature was not given, comparative data 
with other major cities of the world were not given, the 
correlation between certain types of diseases and environmental 
pollution was not specified, and economic substantiation of the 
benefits of rational nature use was not given. 
  The report will be useful to teachers in schools, students, 
businessmen who occupy city real estate, bureaucrats making 
decisions, and simply Muscovites who love their city. 
  I would like to thank everyone who took part in preparing 
the 
report. In 15 years, or even in 50 years, this book will be 
remembered as the basis which first gave comprehensive 
information on the city of Moscow, information against which all 
subsequent changes will be compared. I would very much hope that 
the changes will be for the better. That was the reason the 
report was prepared.

the report. 
<H5>  The Population's Health </H5>
  From 1985 through 1990, indicators of natural population 
growth differed by regions of the city of Moscow. The highest 
natural population growth per 1,000 inhabitants was found in 
Zelenograd (+4.3) and Solntsevo (+3.3). There was negative 
natural growth in Frunzenskiy Rayon (-6.4), Pervomayskiy Rayon 
(-5.5), Leningradskiy Rayon (-5.2), and Oktyabrskiy Rayon (-5.1). 
  Against the background of the sharp drop in the birth rate, 
the proportion of children born with developmental defects is 
rising. The mortality rate of the population in the city of 
Moscow is gradually increasing, by 2-3 percent a year beginning 
in 1987. In 1991 the mortality rate was a record for the last 30 
years. Child mortality is a most important indicator of a 
society's health. In the last 5 year period, an average of 2,923 
children 14 years of age and under and 527 adolescents aged 
15-19 years died every year. Infant mortality (children under 1 
year old) is of most significance in describing the population's 
sanitary-hygienic condition. In the early 1980's, around 20 
children died per 1,000 births. This indicator has now dropped 
to 15. Birth defects and birth-related deaths dominate in the 
structure of infant mortality. That is the cause of death of 
75-83 percent of the infants. 
  Mortality from diseases of the respiratory organs is 
significant (17 per 10,000 births). Children over 1 year of age 
most often died from injuries and accidents (2 per 10,000), 
birth defects (1.75), or tumors (1.6). Adolescent mortality rose 
from 8.3 per 10,000 in 1987 to 10.4 in 1991. More than 50 
percent of the adolescents die of injuries and accidents and 
about 15 percent of them die of tumors. 
  Mortality among working-age Muscovites was 50.5 per 10,000. 
The working-age population dies at a rate 6 times higher than 
that of people aged 2-19. Over the last 5 years, an increase has 
been observed in the mortality rate of the working-age 
population. The greatest increase in the mortality rate was 
found among persons 30-40 years of age. The main causes of death 
among the working-age population of the city of Moscow are heart 
and vascular diseases -- 33.8 percent, tumors -- 26.1 percent, 
and injuries and accidents -- 24.4 percent. As compared with 
1988, mortality rate indicators from injuries and accidents rose 
by 61 percent in 1991, and from tumors and cardiovascular 
diseases -- by 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The 
cancer mortality rate in the city of Moscow in the last 30 years 
is on a steady increase. Thus, the mortality rate indicator from 
lung cancer was 26.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1959 as compared 
to 36.3 in 1989, while for stomach cancer this indicator dropped 
from 71.8 to 41.7. Mortality from cancer of other parts of the 
body is rising gradually. High indicators of cancer mortality 
which were substantially above the average city level were found 
in six of the city's rayons: Kalininskiy, Kiyevskiy, 
Zheleznodorozhnyy, Sevastopolskiy, and Solntsevskiy rayons and 
the city of Zelenograd. Average life expectancy for those born 
in Moscow from 1980 through 1991 is 69 years.

<H5>  Attention: Counterfeit! [by A. I. Leontyev] </H5>
  Not only money but even Karavayev therapeutic balms are 
being 
counterfeited. 
  Almost 3 years ago the Public Fund To Promote Research and 
Initiatives of Citizens on Making Man and the Environment 
Healthy was set up in Moscow; it was named after V. V. 
Karavayev, the philosopher and scientist who formulated the 
integrated preventive-therapeutic system. 
  A person can be healthy only when the three basic metabolic 
processes in his system occur normally, Karavayev asserted. They 
include a physiologically normal diet, breathing, and the 
exchange of mental information (thinking). Any deviation in 
these processes has an immediate effect on the acid-base 
equilibrium (ABE) in the blood. Each person can ascertain the 
ABE in his blood by the color of the conjunctiva (the inside 
surface of the lower eyelid). Normally it is bright pink. If 
there is a skew toward the alkaline, it is dark red to beet red. 
With a skew toward acidic, it is pale pink. For most of our 
fellow countrymen, the ABE of the blood is skewed toward acidic 
(acidosis). 
  Karavayev balms, which affect the skin and mucous membranes, 
are one way to restore the balance. They are Vitaon, a butyric 
extract, Auron, a hydrous extract, and Somaton, a 
hydrous-butyric extract, from medicinal plants. There are from 9 
to 13 medicinal herbs in them, including St. John's wort, 
yarrow, mint, calendula, licorice, thyme, and others. 
  The therapeutic qualities of the balms are unique, and 
urologists, stomatologists, gynecologists, gastroenterologists, 
radiologists, and other specialists immediately started to use 
them. 
  The Karavayev Fund developed the technology and organized 
industrial production of the balms. They immediately became 
popular among Muscovites and do not last long on pharmacy 
shelves. 
  Unfortunately, slick operators have recently, at the peak of 
the balms' popularity, begun moving in: counterfeit Karavayev 
balms have appeared, poured into similar bottles and with 
Karavayev labels. But the counterfeits do not have the 
therapeutic effect inherent in the real Karavayev balms. One can 
distinguish the Karavayev balms from the counterfeits only by 
looking at the quality passport on the Karavayev balms. The seal 
and stamp of the Karavayev Fund should be there. 
  So before you lay down your good money, ask the manager of 
the pharmacy to show you the appropriate documents.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Environment Minister Victor </F>
Danilov-Danilyan by Frank Matthias Drost in Leipzig on 10 March: 
"German Investors Should Commit Themselves More Strongly"] 
  [Text] The minister for environment and natural resources 
of the Russian Federation, Victor Danilov-Danilyan, has 
criticized the privatization policy of his own government. 
Foreign enterprises should be given the opportunity to acquire 
Russian state enterprises, the environment minister said in an 
interview with HANDELSBLATT. Although enterprises are currently 
being privatized it does not take place in the way "that I 
consider necessary." 
  For the reformist politician it is impossible to understand 
why the Russian Government does not use the possibility to 
mobilize foreign capital by selling state enterprises. In view 
of the pronounced decline in production in Russian industry, 
funds for investment are very scarce, Danilov-Danilyan said. 
  The country is not able by itself to modernize enterprises 
and thus to reduce the burden on the environment. The minister 
is convinced that Russian industry must be modernized to achieve 
success in the area of ecology in Russia. Higher direct 
investment by foreign enterprises might help to eliminate the 
capital shortage. 
  The environment minister confirmed the figures contained in 
a 
report issued by the German Economic Research Institute, Berlin, 
according to which the share of environmental investment in 
total investment in Russia was 2 percent in 1992 and continues 
to decrease. This decline can be ended only when industrial 
production recovers, Danilov-Danilyan said. The government is 
of the opinion that 1994 will be the last year of falling 
production in the Russian Federation. 
  He said he did not understand the "inactivity of German 
enterprises" regarding investment projects in Russia. Regarding 
the major projects that involve billions of rubles for the 
development and production of oil and natural gas, German 
companies did "not stand out," and the Russians noticed a "lack 
of initiative." The environment minister does not accept the 
argument of difficult financing. "The Americans and Japanese 
have managed to establish themselves on the Russian market." 
The Germans should follow their example. 
  Still, as far as smaller projects are concerned, cooperation 
does work. At the Terratec special fair for environmental 
protection two contracts were signed on German-Russian 
cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection. One 
project is the development of a measuring network for the 
continuous monitoring of the air quality in the Saratov area. 
This is a first step to include Russia into the European 
environmental data network. The partner to the contract is the 
Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of 
the Saratov area and Medium-Sensor GmbH in Berlin. 
  The second agreement has to do with the development of an 
industry for the processing of secondary plastics in the Russian 
Federation. A processing plant with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes 
per month should be set up in the first phase. The partners to 
the contract are the industrial and trading company Cooperation 
and Development Ltd., Moscow, and the Ostimex Import und Export 
Handelsgesellschaft mbH, Berlin. 
  Things are taking place on a regional level, too. The 
district committee of Ekaterinburg (formerly Sverdlovsk) last 
year bought two mobile environmental monitoring stations in 
Germany. These stations were financed by the Russian ecological 
funds. These come from payments from enterprises that pollute 
the environment. The German-Russian project for the cleansing 
of the Tula area is also being financed through local funds. 
  For Danilov-Danilyan, Germany is one of the leading 
countries 
in the area of environmental technology. However, even Russia 
has very good environmental technologies. A series of 
innovative achievements, which were originally developed in 
armament enterprises, can be used also for environmental 
protection. A plant for the incineration of toxic refuse was, 
for example, developed on the basis of a rocket engine. 
Temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees are reached in this 
process. The environment minister is hoping that this year it 
will be possible to finance the program "Conversion for 
Environmental Protection," which was developed more than two 
years ago. The program consists of several hundreds of projects 
whose development has been concluded. The "real achievements" 
in the area of conversion are not yet very impressive, 
Danilov-Danilyan stated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "Nature Conservation" rubric: </F>
"Ufa Remains a Place Dangerous to Life"] 
  [Text] Research by scientists has shown that in individual 
parts of Ufa the maximum permissible concentrations of an 
extremely toxic substance -- dioxin -- in the air exceed the 
norm by tens of times. In the area where the "Khimprom" 
Production Association, which produces herbicides, is located 
this figure is equal to almost 20,000 times the maximum 
permissible concentration. Newborn babies take in up to 80 
times the maximum permissible concentration of dioxin every day 
with their mother's milk. The republic's gene pool is perishing 
catastrophically. Mothers' milk and the blood and adipose 
tissue of the inhabitants of Bashkortostan are literally 
"larded" with toxic substances in quantities dangerous to life. 
This has been stated by Gennadiy Minin, the republic's chief 
state physician. 
  Misfortune came to the land of Bashkortostan in April 1990. 
Unpurified waste and drainage water from Ufa's "Khimprom" flowed 
into the city water intake, poisoning thousands of cubic meters 
of drinking water with phenol. Knowing nothing, almost all the 
residents of the city with a population of 1 million used 
poisoned water for a long time. Then a large amount of dioxin 
was discovered in the water, the air, and the soil. 
  Despite the city folk's protests, "Khimprom" is continuing 
to 
poison the environment or, rather, what is left of it. In 
addition, one more installation in Ufa has been discovered which 
is surreptitiously destroying nature and people with dioxin -- 
an experimental plant for the production of herbicides. 
  Equipment to analyze the content of dioxin in the 
environment 
was purchased abroad at tremendous expense. But this is not the 
first year that it has been lying totally inactive. Taking 
advantage of the lack of control over it, the Bashkortostan 
State Committee for Ecology and Nature Use is squandering huge 
sums allocated to nature conservation. But a start has not been 
made on resolving the "dioxin problem" in the republic.

  [Text] Over the whole period of its existence the Soviet 
state produced approximately 10 times more chemical weapons [CW] 
than the volume which is in Russia's storage facilities now, 
Chairman of the Security Council's Inter-Departmental Commission 
on Ecological Security Aleksey Yablokov told Interfax. 
  A consultant of this commission Valeriy Menshikov explained 
that in the international convention "On Prohibition of 
Development, Production, Storage, and Exploitation of Chemical 
Weapons and its Destruction" signed on January 13, 1993 Russia 
indicated that there were about 40,000 tons of chemical weapons 
in its arsenal, stored on 7 bases, 6 -- in Russia's European 
part and one -- behind the Ural Mountain Range. 
  However, as Menshikov says, there were several cases of 
secret destruction of chemical weapons and poisonous gases in 
the summer and autumn 1993. 
  Given the fact that official destruction of chemical weapons 
should be carried out under the supervision of international 
controllers, now, as before Russia possesses 40,000 tons of 
chemical weapons. According to Menshikov, this means that by 
the moment the convention was signed the amount of these weapons 
exceeded the announced one. 
  Menshikov failed to answer the question whether this means 
that there are military bases with chemical weapons which were 
not announced officially and if by now the number of the 
chemical weapons has been brought in correspondence with the 
announced number. 
  Menshikov specially stressed that destruction of chemical 
weapons in accordance with the signed convention is an important 
step but "not a sufficient one." In his words, in order "to put 
an end to the possibility of chemical war and its threat" it is 
necessary to make public all data about the production, storage, 
testing, and destruction of chemical weapons in the past and to 
thoroughly investigate and, if necessary, to decontaminate the 
regions where it was stored. 
  In the adverse case, Menshikov believes, the effects of 
chemical weapons earlier dumped on the territory of this nation 
and in the nearby seas will still be felt for some decades to 
come.

<F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Members of the learned 
Council of the Applied Ecology Institute who gathered for their 
final session here, said on Thursday that "according to 
official norms, the accident in Tomsk-7 was estimated, 
regrettably, as not very serious." 
  Institute Deputy Director Andrey Ivanov said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS the following: "It is regrettable that the 
Chernobyl disaster and its aftermaths are taken as a standard of 
nuclear accidents. Events on a smaller scale are regarded as 
not serious." 
  According to previous reports, the accident took place at a 
radiochemical factory of the Siberian combine located near the 
city of Tomsk-7 on April 6, 1993. A radioactive discharge into 
the air contaminated over 200 square kilometers. 
  Institute specialists estimated the content of radionuclides 
in fresh water at villages which turned to be in the area of the 
radioactive fallout, in the air and soil. The permissible doze 
for the village of Georgiyevka situated next to Tomsk-7 was set 
at 0.15 rem (official norm -- 0.5 rem). 
  However, specialists did not calculate possible 
after-effects 
of "hot particles," the effect of which on the human organism is 
unpredictable for the time being. Villagers have not been 
resettled from the dangerous zone. 
  Funds appropriated by the federal budget to do away with the 
accident's aftermaths were not always used for this purpose. 
Additional financing of work entirely depends on the management 
of the chemical combine. 
  Scholars are more optimistic about the radioecological 
situation in the Yenisey river basin. A chemical combine 
situated in the area of Krasnoyarsk had been discharging 
radioactive waste from uniflow nuclear piles into the river for 
over 30 years. 
  As a result, it contaminated water, bottom sediments, 
biological objects and flood-lands situated at a considerable 
distance from the combine. Direct discharge was stopped in 
autumn 1992. 
  However, the bottom and flood-lands contaminated with 
long-lived radionuclides will be for long sources of secondary 
radioactive pollution of the river. It is heartening, the 
deputy director noted, that the content of short-and 
medium-lived nuclides in water sharply dropped after discharges 
were stopped. 
  Regrettably, the content of long-lived cesium-137, cobalt-60 
and europeum-152 and -154 virtually did not change. The 
scientist noted that these nuclides remain a potential source 
for the Yenisey's contamination.

  [Text] Moscow, March 18 KYODO -- Russian does not need for 
the moment to resume nuclear waste dumping at sea thanks to help 
from Japan, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov said 
Thursday [17 March]. 
  "Because the construction of facilities to store liquid 
nuclear waste will be completed by the end of April with Japan's 
assistance, there will be no need for the moment to resume 
dumping," Panov said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Russia's Pacific Fleet had indicated it could be forced to 
resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in May because 
its tanker TNT-5, loaded with some 500 tons of radioactive 
waste, is decaying and the risk of leakage of the waste is 
increasing. 
  The construction cost of the storage facilities will be 
covered by 100 million dollars Japan has pledged to provide to 
Russia to help it dispose radioactive waste, Panov said. 
  Panov expressed thanks for Japan's assistance. He made the 
remarks before Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visits 
Moscow from Saturday to Monday. 
  Last October, Russia dumped 800 tons of liquid radioactive 
waste into the Sea of Japan from a vessel of its Pacific Fleet 
at a point some 550 kilometers west of Hakodate in Hokkaido, 
Japan's northernmost main island. 
  Russia suspended its planned second phase of dumping in the 
Sea of Japan following protests from Japan and South Korea. 
Moscow later urged the Japanese Government to shoulder the cost 
of construction of the land-based waste disposal facility. 
  Russia and Japan since then have continued working-level 
contacts on the disposal of Russia's radioactive waste.

  [Text] The dumping of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of 
Japan by vessels of the Pacific Fleet may be carried out only if 
permitted by the Russian Government. An ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned this at the press center of the Russian Navy when he 
asked the center to comment on a report published in Japan's 
MAINICHI. Citing the head of the chemical service of the 
Pacific Fleet, Valeriy Danilyan, the newspaper wrote that Russia 
may resume the discharge of the waste in the Sea of Japan in May 
this year if foreign countries, including Japan, fail to provide 
financial aid for building special units. The press center of 
the Russian Navy said that this is just a personal opinion of 
one of the commanders of the Pacific Fleet. The Russian 
Government has made no decision concerning the dumping of 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan.

<F P=106> [Viktor Rudenko report: "Is the Duma Trying To Allow Us To </F>
Live? Only Ecological Crisis Is More Acute Than Economic 
Crisis"] 
  [Text] "The economic crisis cannot distract society from 
resolving the highly acute problems of environmental 
protection," Prof. Mikhail Lemeshev, chairman of the Committee 
for Ecology, said at a 16 March news conference in the State 
Duma. As far as the general situation in the country is 
concerned these issues are not so much the concern of future 
generations as a matter of life and death for the current 
generation. 
  In his opinion, the solution to the crisis is to ecologize 
the economy. Some 18 draft laws will be submitted to the Duma 
for consideration in the near future, these laws' task being to 
put the national economy back on the rails of stable 
development. Prof. Lemeshev described five of them as 
priorities. Among them the Law "On Production and Consumption 
Waste Products," which is to safeguard the country against 
highly toxic imported waste among other things. This question 
is causing public concern owing to the furor in connection with 
the 18 freightcars of toxins from France, the Netherlands, and 
Israel that have unexpectedly shown up in Orenburg Oblast and 
pose a real threat to the population's health. 
  Nikolay Astafyev, chairman of the Committee for Natural 
Resources and the Use of Nature, spoke of the need for urgent 
addenda to the Russian Federation Law "On Mineral Resources" 
since many kinds of minerals will be totally depleted over the 
next year if their plunderous extraction is not stopped. The 
same can be said of biological resources: wild animals, whole 
populations of which are being wiped out for their valuable 
antlers or pelts. 
  Prof. Lemeshev is hoping for constructive cooperation with 
the government since, according to him, the Russian Ministry of 
the Environment and Natural Resources and the Duma's nature 
conservation committees espouse similar positions on key issues.

<F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Assumption of a Post," with </F>
Mikhail Yakovlevich Lemeshev, chairman of the Ecology Committee 
of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, 
conducted by Vladimir Mikhaylov; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Vladimir Mikhaylov talks with the chairman of 
the Ecology Committee of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly, Mikhail Yakovlevich Lemeshev. 
  Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I 
would like to congratulate you on assuming the post, your 
election as chairman of the State Duma Ecology Committee. Even 
though it seems to many people today that ecological problems 
are not the most important thing in our present life and that 
there are certainly things which are more important. Do you 
agree with this assertion? 
  Lemeshev: I am deeply certain that the rebirth of 
Russia and the Russian people, which everyone under the sun is 
talking about now, is impossible without solving ecological 
problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the 
ecological situation in the country is simply disastrous; 
everyone understands that, there is no need to explain. In fact 
today we are talking about survival. Take the demographic 
aspect. It is an altogether depressing situation; essentially 
the indigenous peoples of Russia are dying out. The scientific 
research of prestigious scientists, in particular American and 
Japanese scientists, shows that 40 percent of the children born 
in recent times are already ill. What will happen to them later, 
in their adult lives? Generally two-thirds of all diseases today 
are linked to the bad state of the environment. This is more 
urgent for Russia than for the West. 
  Above all it is environmental pollution in cities with a 
population of more than a million inhabitants which causes 
alarm. Here, as a rule, there is very bad water (and generally 
it is bad everywhere in our country) and food products contain 
pesticides, nitrates, and various biological additives. And what 
is interesting is that this applies less to domestically made 
products than to imported products. Propaganda, advertising, and 
pretty packaging do their work here; we are still susceptible to 
all this. The developed countries often sell us what there is no 
demand for in their countries. Incidentally, there are fairly 
strict nature protection laws in many countries of the Western 
world. 
  In my opinion, that is where we must focus our activity, on 
improving the health of our people. That is the primary task. 
Yes, biological diversity and problems of protected territories 
are important, and that is good, but the most important thing is 
people's health. 
  Mikhaylov: But to do all this capital is needed, 
and I would assume a considerable amount of it. Where is it 
supposed to come from, at the expense of what and at whose 
expense? After all, the only thing anyone talks about is the 
meager state treasury and the incredible state budget deficit. 
As a member of the State Duma, you are obliged to take into 
account the conditions of our reality. Are all these things you 
are so persuasively discussing realistic from a financial 
standpoint? 
  Lemeshev: As an economist, I am simply depressed 
by the very widespread opinion that once the economy is in 
crisis, it is then impossible to work on economic problems. It 
is just when such a crisis arises that we supposedly take up 
ecology in earnest. And the saddest thing is that, in my 
opinion, this is simply a bad idea -- it finds a response in 
people's souls. That is certainly understandable: people are on 
the edge of survival and this is the point where it is every man 
for himself, as they say. And that is radically wrong. Without 
solving ecological problems, we will never raise the economy 
either, I am absolutely convinced of that. 
  Here is a clear example. With environmental pollution, 
people 
get sick more often and more seriously and hence do not 
participate in production so actively. Does that have an effect 
on the state's economy or not? In order to treat people, buy 
medicine, and build hospitals, an enormous amount of capital is 
needed. Does that really not put a burden on the economy? Only 
altogether short-sighted people are unable to see that. 
  All right, let us take production of fabrics. For the fabric 
to be good quality, we need not simply water, but clean water. 
Isn't it easier and cheaper not to pollute the water from the 
start rather than spend enormous amounts of money to 
decontaminate it? Remember that it is impossible to separate the 
economy and ecology -- it is a single metasystem. And I would 
like to say one more thing: There are no ecological problems of 
one state or another; ecological problems cannot be solved 
within the boundaries of one state. Say the Scandinavian 
countries have been very successful in solving ecological 
problems, but 90 percent of the pollution of the natural 
environment comes to them from other countries. 
  Mikhaylov: But that is putting the question in 
general terms, so to speak; now what practical steps should the 
committee begin with, in your opinion? What draft laws do you 
consider paramount in the sphere of environmental protection? 
  Lemeshev: I would not want to complain right off 
of lack of organization, but as of now for 15 deputies and just 
as many apparat employees we have two small rooms, no 
typewriters, no computers, and no organizational equipment. I do 
not know how we are going to work. 
  As for the committee's legislative work, I believe preparing 
a draft law on ecological disaster zones is most important. 
True, all Russia can now be called an ecological disaster zone, 
but there are the worst ones, say the Chernobyl disaster zone, 
rayons where chemical and petrochemical production are 
concentrated, and production sites of hydrocarbon raw materials 
in northern Russia where a terrible blow is being inflicted on 
the habitat of the small peoples. We are in dire need of a law 
on the ecological expert study, not a departmental one, as is 
customary now, but a federal state expert study with broad 
public participation. Only in that way will we be able to put up 
a barrier on the path of projects that destroy both nature and 
humans themselves. 
  And isn't legislation on drinking water important? Must we 
not make additions to the Criminal Code related to 
accountability for ecological crimes? So there is a vast field 
of work. 
  Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking over the 
list of members of your committee, the fair degree of diversity 
caught my attention: there are deputies from "Russia's Choice," 
and communists, and members of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] faction. Doesn't it seem to you that this lack of 
political uniformity will hinder the committee's normal 
lawmaking work? Moreover, you must build constructive relations 
with the Russian Federation Ministry of Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources. 
  Lemeshev: As for the latter, I feel optimistic 
because of the fact that the minister himself, Viktor Ivanovich 
Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee, and at least for 
now, we have a mutual understanding on all issues. Although I 
have heard plenty of the unbiased polemics between 
Danilov-Danilyan and the chairman of the RF Interdepartmental 
Commission on Ecological Safety, Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, 
which unfolded on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, personally I 
do not quite like it when such disagreements arise between such 
respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian 
intelligentsia and we must discard departmental, political, and 
professional ambitions when it is a matter of the common cause. 
We must change our psychology. But I look at the work of our 
committee with hope because I am certain that the task of 
preserving the environment can unite people of the most diverse 
political views.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Dmitruk: "Surprises of the `Peaceful </F>
Atom': The Insidious Trail of Iodine-131"] 
  [Text] Many people could be exposed to radiation in 
regions the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Authority] 
considers suitable for human habitation. This is the disturbing 
conclusion of Candidate of Technical Sciences Boris Karasev, 
senior scientific associate at the Hydrogeology and Engineering 
Geology Institute. 
  Few people know about the independent study conducted by 
teams of experts from the Sociology Institute of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Center for Civic Initiative in 
Bryansk, Zhitomir, and Gomel oblasts in 1991 and 1992. They 
found that many people living in these regions displayed signs 
of acute radiation sickness, which can be caused by doses of 
100-400 rad. Some of the victims had died. In others, the 
sickness had taken chronic forms: Their complaints included 
asthenia, headaches, xerostomia, enlarged lymph nodes, and 
tumors of the thyroid gland and other organs. Half of the 
children in zones of radioactive pollution measuring more than 
40 c/km[.sup]2[/] are suffering from these chronic forms of 
illness. 
  The independent commission's findings contradicted the IAEA 
reports that the radioactive pollution in the contaminated 
regions could not cause any particular damage. Then why did 
local inhabitants, contrary to the expectations of the nuclear 
scientists, suffer radiation injuries? The independent experts 
had no explanation. It was not until two years later than Boris 
Karasev found the reason. 
  He went to the regions affected by the Chernobyl disaster 
each year to study the content and migration of regressive 
radionuclides. The experimental findings he accumulated are 
unique: They serve as the basis for fundamentally new 
theoretical conclusions. 
  Boris Karasev frequently encountered paradoxical cases: Some 
of the people in regions where the average level of radiation 
did not exceed the allowable limit had been exposed to doses of 
radiation dozens of times as high as the hazard level set by the 
USSR Ministry of Health. People in these regions sometimes died 
of radiation sickness.... 
  The researcher's observations were corroborated by the 
Russian-American commission of independent experts. After 
comparing its findings to his own, Boris Karasev was able to 
guess the secret of the radiation injuries these people had 
suffered. 
  "According to official data," Boris Viktorovich explained, 
"the damaged power unit in Chernobyl discharged around 40 
percent of the cesium-137 and almost all of the iodine-131 it 
contained at the time of the accident. These radioisotopes 
entered the environment in approximately the same quantities, 
but their effects were incomparable. The fact is that iodine-131 
has an extremely short half-life -- eight days -- and is 
therefore highly radioactive. It is a thousand times more active 
than cesium-137, for example, with its half-life of 30 years. 
Iodine-131 is extremely volatile and can be carried thousands of 
kilometers in clouds of radioactive dust. It is also highly 
soluble, and it penetrates soil easily, where it is absorbed by 
plants and then enters the organism of animals and humans. These 
properties of iodine are the reason for the colossal damage it 
inflicted on the environment in the first days after the 
Chernobyl disaster. 
  Radioactive background levels were three or four times as 
high even in Moscow at the end of April 1986, and in Kiev they 
were almost 8,000 times as high, reaching 5 milliroentgens per 
hour. 
  The population of Novozybkovskiy Rayon in Bryansk Oblast was 
not advised to use powdered milk and to protect and 
decontaminate buildings until after May Day. The antitoxin for 
the radioactive iodine was distributed...three weeks after the 
accident, when this isotope had already decayed. Many people 
shared this experience: Almost all of us -- from Kiev to Moscow 
and Minsk -- breathed, drank, and ate some iodine-131 in late 
April and early May 1986. What did this do to us? 
  Almost all of the iodine entering the human organism is 
absorbed by the thyroid gland. It takes on most of the brunt of 
the iodine shock. Whereas the average load on the organism does 
not exceed the maximum allowable dose of radiation by 
radioactive iodine -- 30 rem -- the local radiation of the 
thyroid can be as high as 800 rem. That is why people are 
suffering from numerous disorders of the thyroid gland -- even 
cancer and the destruction of thyroid tissue -- in regions where 
the IAEA believes that the level of radiation is not dangerous. 
  The amount of radioactive iodine carried by precipitation 
differed widely: In some places the content in the soil was 
dozens of times higher than in surrounding areas. Some types of 
plants absorbed it more vigorously and were then consumed by 
humans. Other people ingested iodine-131 in concentrated form -- 
in the milk of cows and goats feeding on radioactive grass. 
  All of this could have been harmless for people who had 
drunk 
potassium iodide: This substance contains non-radioactive 
iodine, and a thyroid saturated with it will cease to absorb 
radioactive iodine, which will then quickly be flushed out of 
the organism. Regrettably, most of the inhabitants of the 
affected regions learned about this too late. 
  "But the nuclear scientists," I said to the researcher, 
"must 
have known about the horrible implications of the massive 
accident at the nuclear plant. Why did they not warn the 
civilian population in time and supply it with the means of 
preventing radiation sickness?" 
  "On orders from the government," Boris Karasev replied, 
"some 
`specialists' are still pretending that they know nothing about 
this danger. They calculate the average maximum allowable doses 
for polluted territories and seem not to notice the statistical 
disparities, which can be quite sizable. Their calculations are 
based on methods military specialists have been using since the 
early 1960's. For some unknown reason, however, the `experts' in 
calculating the maximum dose for civilians have been drawing 
harmonious isoflux patterns of radionuclide dispersion and 
migration on their charts, showing that everything is fine on 
the average, and have argued that exceptional cases cannot be 
anticipated. It turns out, however, that they can: Several other 
researchers and I compiled the logarithmic curves for different 
isotopes long ago, showing how the population can absorb doses 
of varying intensity. These curves have extremely long `tails': 
This means that some people in territories deemed safe by the 
IAEA can receive a more than lethal dose. This was corroborated 
by the independent Russian-American commission in 1991 and 1992." 
  "Judging by your graphs, however, some people in the 
polluted 
territories received doses that were hundreds or even thousands 
of times as high as the average. Is this really possible?" 
  "It is, and that is the whole problem. Specialists know that 
the reactor discharged huge quantities of so-called hot 
particles at the time of the Chernobyl accident in Chernobyl. At 
a temperature of 2,000 degrees the radioisotopes were `fused' 
together. They formed extremely tiny grains, no larger than a 
hundredth of a micron, but they were many times more active than 
the rest of the substance. 
  "These particles do not dissolve in water. If they get into 
the lungs, they stay there until they decay. During that time 
the individual could receive local doses thousands of times as 
high as the allowable maximum: This individual would be just as 
sick as someone who received a lethal dose when the atom bomb 
was dropped. 
  "Of course, these details spoil the rosy picture the IAEA 
has 
painted, but is it not time to remove our rose-colored glasses 
and face the danger? Accidents at nuclear plants are still 
occurring, and no one is insured against new Chernobyls. 
  "It is no secret that small nuclear reactors are operating 
in 
Moscow and other big cities. Powerful Mev reactors are operating 
in many oblasts. Even in the fail-safe mode, some reactors 
discharge many different radioactive substances through their 
exhaust pipes. Nuclear power engineers argue that these 
substances are distributed evenly across a huge territory, but 
according to logarithmic law there is the possibility of quite 
sizable disparities. In some types of weather, the smoke from 
pipes hugs the ground, and the iodine-131, krypton-85, and other 
radioisotopes in the smoke can be washed away by rain. There is 
the possibility, therefore, that the content of radioactive 
isotopes in the air and soil in some places is higher than the 
danger level -- with all of the ensuing consequences. 
  "If anyone still plans to start up huge new reactors at 
nuclear power plants," the researcher said in conclusion, "he 
must consider the serious danger of iodine shock as a result of 
a disaster, as well as the uneven patterns of radioisotope 
fall-out in the fail-safe mode. All of the old forecasts, after 
all, turned out to be inaccurate, to say the least. We need new 
calculations, based on logarithmic curves. They probably would 
prove the need for higher expenditures on gas masks, potassium 
iodide, decontamination agents, and other means of preventing 
radiation injuries in the civilian population. Can anyone doubt 
that these expenditures will be recouped a thousandfold by the 
preservation of the health of millions of people?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Rikhardovich Vaaks, director of </F>
Belarusian Research Center "Ecology," by nonstaff reporter 
Mikhail Magnitskiy; place and date not given: "Ecology Is the 
Privilege of the Rich. So, What Should We Do?" -- first 
paragraph is DOBRY VECHAR introduction] 
  [Text] In May 1991, the Cabinet of Ministers set up the 
Belarusian Research Center "Ecology" [BelNITS]. BelNITS 
Director Viktor Rikhardovich Vaaks agreed to meet with our 
nonstaff reporter Mikhail Magnitskiy. 
  Magnitskiy: Viktor Rikhardovich, what are the aims 
of this new research center? What difficulties have you 
encountered in your work? 
  Vaaks: At the beginning, BelNITS was a key 
research center which coordinated the protection of the 
environment and rational use of our Republic's natural 
resources. The BelNITS was entrusted with too many duties, 
which, to my regret, were not adequately supported financially. 
Our state orders stood at 20 percent of our true work 
potential. So, we had to rack our brains over our chances to 
survive in the future. We concluded contracts for conducting 
research. Some state institutions and associations were 
unwilling to support us with information on the current state of 
various environmental sectors. We must analyze it for the State 
Committee for Ecology [Goskomekologiya]. It was incredible when 
one state institution received a state grant to collect 
information on a certain subject and demanded additional 
payments from another state institution which had to analyze 
their data. In my mind, this is how people misinterpret market 
relations. 
  Magnitskiy: As far as I have understood you, the 
BelNITS was hardly set up when it began to face these 
difficulties.... 
  Vaaks: Yes, you are absolutely correct. We began 
to learn the art of survival from the very beginning.... More 
than 160 people -- among them some 40 candidates of sciences -- 
are employed with us. Our center is staffed with unique experts 
in 36 branches of science. They are experts in geography, 
geology, hydrology, agrochemical science, hydraulic engineering, 
land surveying, technology, waste processing, energy 
engineering, sociology, economics, law, and others disciplines. 
This allows us -- contrary to other research institutions -- to 
analyze every facet of an environmental problem. We were the 
first to draft the Procedures for Comprehensive Territorial 
Environmental Protection Programs [TerKSOP) for Rechitsa, Gomel, 
Zhlobin, Mozyr and their rayons. Besides, we began drafting a 
similar TerKSOP for Gomel Oblast, and beginning in 1994, we are 
planning to draft a TerKSOP for Mogilev Oblast. Procedures for 
drafting these programs have been forwarded to the 
Goskomekologiya for its approval. This will allow the Republic 
to have comprehensive environmental protection programs, which 
could provide a proper basis for analyzing and adopting relevant 
decisions. These procedures will allow local soviets, the 
Goskomekologiya, and the government to realize the ecological 
situation on the territory of the Republic, to have a list of 
key ecology-oriented measures based not on the departmental 
approach to the environment but on the analysis of the entire 
environmental situation. Eventually, this will allow us to 
properly distribute small financial grants issued by the state 
for environmental purposes. 
  Magnitskiy: What other research does your center 
conduct? 
  Vaaks: Goskomekologiya commissioned us to draft 
expert ecological conclusions, procedures, plans, and programs 
which could effect the environment. In addition, we draft 
resolutions on the state of ecological sites; prepare 
environmental reports on industrial enterprises and waste dumps 
for state institutions carrying out environmental controls; 
draft specifications foreseeing ultimate norms for discharging 
and preserving waste, thermal and electrical energy, and so on. 
I want to emphasize that in 1993, BelNITS worked on some 50 
contracts (in 1992, there were only 14 contracts). 
  Magnitskiy: Viktor Rikhardovich, currently, many 
people and organizations have begun to deal with the 
environment. In your opinion, are the qualifications and 
analyses of experts always adequate? 
  Vaaks: We should hail this tendency. Only man can 
help nature and himself. In my mind, we have highly qualified 
experts. However, I believe that we should not only have 
specialized experts in, for example, soil or water protection. 
We require both experts with an ecological knowledge in one 
particular environmental sphere (water, soil, air, biosphere, 
and etc.) and experts in various spheres of knowledge, who are 
also competent in the legal field. Beginning in March 1992, we 
began running nationwide programs to improve environmental 
qualifications: In 1993, we trained 187 people in eight groups, 
while in 1994, we are planning to train ten groups of 
specialists. We rank high in the opinions of our students. In 
my mind, our environmental experts should also train abroad. 
  Magnitskiy: By the way, do you cooperate with 
foreign partners? 
  Vaaks: Under the Goskomekologiya umbrella, we 
participate in international conventions. I could name such 
programs as "On Biological Divergency," "On International Trade 
With Disappearing Wild Fauna and Flora Species," "On Protection 
of the Ozone Layer," and "Green Lungs of Europe." 
  The BelNITS has also served as host for international 
conferences and meetings on various directions in environmental 
protection, not to mention a Belarusian seminar on water 
problems. 
  BelNITS cooperates with firms such as "Volksbilding und 
Kultur," the "Carl Duisberg Centrum," and "Utecon" from Germany, 
"Construzioni Dondi" from Italy; we established contacts with 
"Lahmeyer International," "GKW Consult," and "Alberatungs 
Gesellschaft" from Germany, "PA Consulting Group" from England, 
"Viaten Tapiola" and "The Finnish Foreign Trade Association" 
from Finland, "Cowiconsult" from Denmark, and "OBGRT" from 
Poland, among others. 
  We are eager to participate in the International Program for 
Studying Contamination of the Baltic Sea with superficial and 
underground water. This work is coordinated by the State 
Institute for Geology and Vilnius University in Lithuania. 
  Magnitskiy: With which Belarusian organizations 
and firms do you cooperate? 
  Vaaks: I acknowledge that it is difficult to 
enumerate all our partners. First of all, we cooperate with 
academic and research institutions, ecological committees, 
public organizations, the State Committees for Statistics and 
Meteorology, and the Defense Ministry. Our center organized such 
public organizations as International Ecologic Academy, its 
Belarusian branch and Soligorsk filial, and the Independent 
Belarusian Ecological Research Association. In addition, we 
organized comparatively small state ecological organizations 
BelEKOINFOR, NITS "Energo," "EOS," "SEKOP," "MGEP," and "KBIAS" 
[expansions unknown]. I will be self critical: We have an 
enormous amount of environmental information but have not 
published very much. 
  Magnitskiy: In what direction are you going to 
work in the immediate future? 
  Vaaks: The Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers deemed 
BelNITS as the key center in conducting research on the ozone 
layer, drafting unified procedures for environmental monitoring 
and surveying of natural resources. In addition, the Belarusian 
National Center "Infoterra" is operating under our auspices. We 
will continue to draft not only normative ecological documents 
-- which the nature conservation organizations consistently lack 
-- but also proposals to update waste processing technologies, 
energy saving measures, and waste utilization. 
  Magnitskiy: In the past, the phrase "If I were a 
director, I would do this and that" was very popular. I would 
like to paraphrase this the following way: What would you do in 
the sphere of ecology if you were a politician? 
  Vaaks: In Belarus, much has been done recently to 
upgrade our environmental legislation. However, this work 
should be continued, new legislative acts should be drafted. It 
should be taken into consideration that Belarus is extremely 
contaminated with radiation due to the Chernobyl accident; our 
territory is used to transit international communications; we 
have an extensive program to eliminate and privatize military 
sites. In my opinion, an "Ecological Bank" should be set up to 
ease the drafting and implementation of nature-saving 
projects.... 
  Magnitskiy: Viktor Rikhardovich, I wish success to 
you and your collective. The "Ecology" center must help resolve 
the most acute ecological problems in our Republic and its 
capital.

<F P=106> [Report by RID correspondent Yuriy Leshkevich: "Fire Will </F>
Help"] 
  [Text] As of today, Belarus has only two waste processing 
factories: in Minsk and Mogilev. 
  However, their low capacity does not resolve the problem 
with 
the utilization of consumer waste which sounds extremely acute 
in the Republic of late. In Belarus, registered waste sites 
occupy some 700 hectares of land, while the area occupied by 
unregistered waste sites is even larger. Therefore, the only 
option is to build waste burning factories similar to ones which 
are "at service" in all civilized states. 
  RID has learned that the construction of such a waste 
burning 
factory is being planned close to Gomel. According to experts, 
total costs of this construction project will stand at around 
320 million German marks. The output of this factory will be 
500 tonnes of waste per year. According to the plans, this 
factory will also burn silt which accumulates in our Republic at 
a rate of close to 1 million tonnes per year.

<F P=106> [Article by Tiit Tambi: "Problems of Nuclear Waste Removal </F>
About To Be Solved"] 
  [Text] A conference of the working group on nuclear 
and radiation safety in the Baltic Seaboard countries ended in 
Tallinn yesterday. 
  At a meeting with journalists following the conference, 
Antii 
Vuorinen from Finland said that the radiation danger still 
plagues the Baltic Sea region. To reduce that danger, it is 
necessary that the newly freed Baltic states join with 
agreements that have previously been concluded with the Soviet 
Union. These would include agreements on curbing the 
proliferation of nuclear substances and, in case of danger, 
making information available promptly. Vuorinen was pleased that 
the problem of removing nuclear waste from Paldiski is close to 
being solved. 
  Foreign ministry advisor Mark Sinisoo elaborated on his 
remark. Namely, the working group had received new data on 
several of the problems recently. To remove nuclear waste from 
Paldiski, Russia wants to use a brand new TK-18 type of 
container that has never been used for that purpose before. This 
is why they have to be tested, which is to be done in March. 
What if Russia's nuclear monitoring agency should declare them 
unfit? 
  Russia, at this time, does also not have a policy for 
storing 
nuclear waste, and this needs to be coordinated with the 
government. Besides, this policy supposedly also depends on the 
availability of money and on Russia's so-called `global nuclear 
problems.' By way of consolation: The Paldiski issue will not be 
coming to a standstill because of these snags. 
  The working group also discussed Sillamae and matters 
related to radioactive beacons. Other news pertaining to the 
not-so-secret Salaspilsis reactor in Latvia (a science-oriented 
facility) revealed that it uses 90-percent enriched uranium. The 
latter presents quite a hazard.

<F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "Cement Plant in Estonia Gets Big </F>
Environment Loan"] 
  [Text] The World Bank through its subsidiary, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), has granted over 200 
million [Danish] kroner for modernizing and improving the 
environmental impact of a large cement plant in Estonia, AS 
Kunda Nordic Cement. The agreement is IFC's largest investment 
project in the former Soviet Union. 
  According to a preliminary agreement, around 56 million 
kroner of this amount will be used for expanding the harbor 
facilities in Kunda, while 50 million are earmarked for 
environmental improvements, including stronger filters. 
  The cement plant, which was built in the 1960's based on 
East 
German brown- coal technology, has for years been the area's 
greatest environmental threat, because the plant each hour 
unhindered has been spewing out 15 tons of cement dust up 
through its smokestacks -- corresponding to 10-15 percent of 
production. Converting this, it means that in 10 years enough 
cement to build two Great Belt bridges has fallen on the head of 
inhabitants of Kunda. 
  The Kunda plant currently is responsible for a third of 
Estonia's total air pollution, but after modernization is 
completed, it is expected that this level will drop to 1 or 2 
percent. At the same time, production is expected to double to 
900,000 tons annually. 
  The greatest part of production is expected to be earmarked 
for Western markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Leydur Rannamets: "The Mechanism for Protecting </F>
the Environment Works"] 
  [Text] Clean air, water and soil have become luxuries 
for which we must pay -- that is how we may summarize the 
statements made by the vice-chancellor of the ER [Estonian 
Republic] Department of the Environment, Eva Kraav, and other 
specialists at a press conference held on Monday. 
  The Environmental Protection Fund was created in Estonia 
already 10 years ago, but only quite recently, after the 
adoption of laws on the protection of natural resources and on 
the environmental protection fund, has the money begun to go 
into the treasury as it should. For the right to use natural 
resources, our enterprises last year paid out over million kron, 
and for pollution of the environment -- another 19 million kron. 
The GAO [joint-stock company] "Eesti pylevkivi" paid 8 million 
kron into the state budget, and half of this sum returned to the 
budget of Ida-Virusskiy district. The largest polluters of the 
air basin in the Northwest -- the Narva power plants -- paid 2 
million kron each for their "smoke trains." Yes, the rates of 
pay for the right to use natural resources and the sums of 
compensation for pollution of the environment are currently 
growing, but only within the limits of inflation, emphasized Eva 
Kraav. 
  The payment for natural resource utilization comprises 1.5 
percent in the price of shale, 0.3 percent in the price of 
electricity, and 0.1 percent in the price of the others. The 
World Bank is indignant and is demanding an increase in the 
stated rate in order to attract more money to the budget. 
However, Estonia, in the words of Eva Kraav, is resisting this, 
clearly foreseeing the consequences of this step for the 
population. 
  Where is the money of the Environmental Protection Fund 
going? 
  Half goes to the central fund, while the other half remains 
in the districts. The utilization of monies from the central 
fund is the perogative of its council, in which all the 
districts and cities are also represented. The money goes 
primarily for the construction of purification structures and 
for the development of the environmental protection 
infrastructure. Last year, more was allocated for facilities 
which were in their stages of completion. Among them were 
purification structures in Tyuri, Otepya, Tammsalu, Vyaymela, 
and Vyru, the construction of sewers in Yykhvi, Voka, and others. 
  That village, city or enterprise which has effective 
purification structures pays significantly less for pollution of 
the environment. That is how interest in developing a normally 
operating purification system is encouraged. After the 
installations for biological purification of sewage waters were 
placed into operation in Tallinn in October of last year, the 
city began to pay significantly less to this fund. Yet Tartu, 
which sends its sewer water along the Emayyga to Lake Chudskoye 
in an almost unpurified state, must pay a hefty price. 
  The most unfavorable situation, as before, is in the 
northwest. It is true that because of the decline in production 
Narva has begun to consume less water, and the project capacity 
of the facilities makes it possible now to keep up with the 
purification of the water which is used. However, problems 
remain. 
  In Tallinn the main culprit in pollution of the air basin is 
auto transport. 
  Economic mechanisms for protecting the environment have 
begun 
to work. We may expect an improvement in the situation, but only 
if all the money collected for environmental protection purposes 
is used for its designated purpose, and not "rechanneled" to 
other needs. Sometimes that happens too.

  [Text] The Green Party of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
ecological association "Green World" held a news conference on 
18 March dedicated to the issue of the ecologically dangerous 
enterprises in Kiev. These, in particular, are plants "Radykal" 
[Radical], "Khimvolokno" [Chemical Fiber], TE-6, as well as 
automobile transport and the radioactive contamination of the 
capital as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station. 
  The news conference was attended by Green Party Chairman 
Vitaliy Kononov, Yuriy Samoylenko, first deputy chairman of the 
Ukrainian ecological association "Green World", Serhiy 
Konyukhov, the chairman of the Ecological Commission of the 
Ukrainian Republican Party, Mykhaylo Mykhalko, the chairman of 
the "Save Holosiyevo" Union [woodland on outskirts of Kiev], and 
others. Anatoliy Panov, the executive director of the newspaper 
ZELENYY SVIT [GREEN WORLD], expressed his conviction that the 
"hushing up of the fact that Kiev did suffer as a result of the 
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station is not just a 
detrimental but a criminal phenomenon. If our state has no 
money to provide medical treatment to Kievites and improve their 
health, this money could be provided by the world public." 
  At the news conference, Greenpeace-Ukraine made public its 
press release disclosing a secret decree No. 64/94 by Ukraine's 
president of 23 February 1994 "On urgent measures to develop 
nuclear power engineering and create a nuclear-fuel cycle in 
Ukraine." The decree, in particular, envisages the 
commissioning of four new reactors at the Zaporozhye, 
Khmelnitskiy, and Rovno nuclear power stations and also the 
repair and putting into operation of the second power unit at 
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which was ruined by fire in 
October 1991.

<F P=106> [Oleksiy Breus report: "The 'Greens' Come in Different </F>
Shades"] 
  [Text] At the end of February, at a news conference held 
in the building of the ecological association "Green World," 
Ukraine's Green Party disseminated a statement in support of the 
decision adopted by the Ukrainian president and Supreme Council 
on renouncing nuclear weapons and demanded that Minister of 
Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko be dismissed from his 
post because he, allegedly, spoke against nuclear disarmament. 
The first deputy chairman of the "Green World," Yuriy 
Samoylenko, said on that occasion that the association supported 
the statement and told HOLOS UKRAYINY about it on 24 February. 
  However, a few days later, chairman of the "Green World" 
Mykola Korobko stated that his association did not and does not 
support anybody's demands for Yu. Kostenko's resignation. As 
regards Yu. Samoylenko, it appears that the Association's Green 
Council expressed no-confidence in him as far back as October 
1993. However, that move did not receive much publicity. 
  Another deputy chairman of the "Green World" Anatoliy 
Zolotukhin reported by telegram from Nikolayev, where he heads 
the association's oblast organization, about business relations 
with Yu. Kostenko and changes for the better at the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection. At the same time, he supported the 
renunciation of nuclear weapons. 
  Minister Yu. Kostenko himself further specified that he 
never 
was against nuclear disarmament, but that it should not be 
detrimental to Ukraine. For example, if Russia takes the 
[nuclear] warheads, it should not leave behind the poisonous 
heptyl that is used as fuel for missiles. He also added that, 
today, concrete ecological deeds on the part of the "Greens" 
would be more useful than their opportunist political chatter.

<F P=106> [Philippe Escande report: "Difficult Birth of Environment </F>
Agency"] 
  [Text] Decided in 1989 and then officially created in 
1990, the European Environment Agency still does not have its 
own home. Tossed about by political battles which go way beyond 
it, this modest institution has so far not had much luck. For 
three years, France, although it initiated the project, blocked 
any decision on the agency's headquarters while the future of 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg was threatened. The 
affair was settled last year and resulted in the selection of 
Copenhagen as the final headquarters. 
  This new Community body, modest in size, corresponds to an 
extremely ambitious objective: To finally give the European 
Union the means of pursuing a real environment policy. "In the 
absence of any reliable statistics, we cannot say anything about 
the state of the environment and respect for the directives in 
the different countries of the Union," Ioannis Paleokrassas, 
current commissioner for the environment in the European 
Commission, admitted. It is still impossible to compare the 
quantity of waste consumed, air pollution, or the quality of 
water between two Union countries. Indeed, Brussels' aim is to 
have a reliable and indisputable tool which enables it both to 
prepare future directives on the environment more efficiently 
and to monitor their effectiveness on the ground. 
<H5>  Independence but Modest Budget </H5>
  "The original idea was also to combat ecological 
inequalities 
by preventing the transfer of polluting activities to less 
demanding countries," Jacques Varet, director of research at the 
Environment Ministry and first chief of the French Environment 
Institute (IFEN), explained. The aim now is to gather, check, 
and process data coming from the whole European Union in order 
to make them available to Brussels but also to the member states 
and the public (associations or enterprises). 
  To carry out its task effectively, the agency will have 
around 40 people an a budget of around 10 million ECU's 
[European Currency Units] (ECU 9.5 million this year, almost ECU 
13 million when fully operational). These are limited means 
which force it to work through a network. Correspondents in 
each country, called "focal points" in Community jargon, will 
have the task of collecting these data. In Germany, the focal 
point will simply be the big Federal Environment Agency, whereas 
France has set up a body especially devoted to this work -- the 
IFEN. It is for the European Agency to harmonize the methods, 
to compile and interpret the results. In addition, for specific 
requests, the agency will use thematic centers (which may or may 
not be focal points) on specific subjects such as air, water, 
noise, waste, or land use. 
<H5>  Political Role </H5>
  At first, the agency will mainly work on air and water 
quality, natural habitats, and waste. These priorities were all 
defined in the Fifth EU Framework Program. Every three years it 
will publish a report on the environment, a vast compendium 
including all the data harmonized at European level. Meanwhile, 
it will design specific studies, for instance on acid rain, 
waste transportation, or the greenhouse effect. 
  The director of the agency should be appointed in April. A 
work program covering several years will then be drawn up before 
the summer. Officially, this institution will work completely 
independently. This is demonstrated by the fact that its 
18-member administrative council will comprise in particular two 
Commission members, two others appointed by the European 
Parliament, one representative per member state, a 
representative from Eurostat (the European statistical body), 
and one from the Joint Research Centers. This independence could 
ultimately engender tension. Although all states agree on the 
need to have a data collection tool, many are worried about 
seeing this institution transformed into a censor with the task 
of pointing out the good and bad students (which are not 
necessarily those you would expect...) in the European Union in 
the sphere of the environment and the implementation of EU 
directives. 
  This is a "political" role which it is so far being refused 
but which Brussels would like to see it playing. If it is 
simply a question of compiling and harmonizing statistics, was 
there any need to create a new body when a powerful tool in this 
sphere already exists with Eurostat? In addition, the web-like 
organization of the network, with focal points intersected by 
thematic centers, raises the fear of an escalation of 
bureaucracy, for which Brussels is already all too often 
criticized. 
  The agency, because of this "battle of headquarters," comes 
rather late, at a time when many of the European directives have 
already been adopted or are "in the pipeline" and especially at 
a time when the environment no longer has the same influence as 
before within the Commission and in the member states. It will 
therefore quickly have to prove that, despite its late arrival, 
it is still an observation post which is more vital than ever.

<F P=106> [Julius Lorincz report on "recent" news conference in Vienna </F>
with Austrian President Thomas Klestil: "Our Region Has a 
Tremendous Future" -- first paragraph is editorial introduction] 
  [Text] Thomas Klestil, President of the Republic of 
Austria, recently received a group of Slovak reporters -- from 
NARODNA OBRODA, PRACA, SLOVENSKY DENNIK, UJ SZO, SLOBODNY PIATOK 
weekly, and PRAVDA. The reason for this meeting in his study at 
the Vienna Hofburg was the upcoming visit by the Slovak 
president to Austria. Although in the meantime domestic events 
in Slovakia resulted in a postponement of the visit, the 
frankness and stimulating nature of the discussion with Klestil 
undoubtedly warrant our passing on some of the ideas and views 
of the Austrian president. 
  In the introduction, he pointed out that Austria has for 
decades endeavored to remove the Iron Curtain, to create the 
conditions for good neighborhood despite the diverse ideological 
views. "Austria was like a window, but the Iron Curtain is 
gone, and we are very close neighbors capable of extensive 
cooperation. There are no two capitals as close to one another 
as Vienna and Bratislava. Moreover, as I study our relations on 
a daily basis and in the long- time perspective, I believe that 
this region has a tremendous future. You know that at this time 
we have problems concerning the transit of automobile transport 
through Austria, and we are also discussing it with the European 
Union. We have, however, the great option of transferring the 
transport not only to the railroad but also to the Danube River. 
After all, there is the Rhine-Main-Danube Channel, there soon 
may be also a Danube-Oder channel, and if some facilities are 
added, Vienna and Bratislava can become important reloading 
centers. There are great possibilities for an important power 
center to emerge in our region -- oil and gas pipelines from 
Russia pass through here, and the Adria oil pipeline. I am also 
thinking of cooperation between Vienna and Bratislava airports, 
of the entire infrastructure of the two great cities." 
  In the subsequent part of the discussion, Klestil pointed 
out 
that just a "nice picture" of the proximity of Vienna and 
Bratislava is not enough for Austrian-Slovak relations -- the 
cooperation requires the entire background of the two states 
and, in this context, he acknowledged that Austria is the 
"number one" foreigner in founding joint firms and various forms 
of joint ventures in Slovakia. 
  A lot of the discussion was dedicated to Central Europe and 
relations in this part of the continent. According to Klestil, 
Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia are 
interesting neighbors who are undergoing the transition to 
democratic states with a market economy: "Do you know that in 
the last few days, we have progressed on the road towards the 
European Union, and the firmer embedded we are there, the better 
we will be able to optimize your being our neighbors. We are in 
a certain sense merging again. No, I do not mean to be nostalgic 
about history -- I am a republican and a democrat -- but when I 
sit here in the room that once belonged to Josef II, and next to 
it is Maria Theresia's room -- it is only natural to perceive 
the bonds of Central Europe. The unnatural borders have 
disappeared, actually old possibilities have been revived and 
new possibilities of cooperation have been created." 
  The president of the Republic of Austria continued in these 
reflections when the conversation turned to the meeting in 
Litomysl [eastern Bohemia] of the presidents of the Central 
European countries planned for April at the instigation of 
President Havel: "We should discuss there what Central Europe 
is, what our cooperation should be like, and political 
developments in this region. Yes, we should talk about the use 
of nuclear power, which is a very sensitive and aggravating 
issue for Austria. We have problems with the Czech Republic 
because of Temelin [nuclear power plant under construction], we 
are afraid of Jaslovske Bohunice and Mochovce [Slovak nuclear 
power plants]. You know, years ago, we decided in Austria -- I 
did not support this view then -- not to manufacture nuclear 
power. It must be understood that we expect Slovakia and other 
states to respect the population on the other side of the border 
-- a radioactive cloud such as Chernobyl's cannot be stopped by 
borders. Hence, the dangerous consequences of a conceivable 
nuclear accident has nothing to do with state sovereignty and 
borders. 
  The discussion also touched upon Austrian neutrality and its 
present meaning. Thomas Klestil said: "When I entered the 
presidential election campaign, I brought up the question of 
neutrality for a public discussion. Some of my advisers asked 
me then with consternation whether I am giving up hope of being 
elected. I declared, however, that neutrality is not a goal in 
itself, that it is a matter of security and guarantees. The 
security issue no longer has just a military dimension, it does 
not mean only protection against a military threat. In today's 
world, the threats have changed -- there are floods of refugees, 
migration flows, organized crime, drugs, nuclear accidents, and 
polluted environment. It was demonstrated that the public is 
ready for a down-to-earth discussion about these issues and is 
willing to accept a reasonable explanation. We succeeded in 
getting Austrians to accept Austria's joining the European Union 
in accordance with the law on neutrality. It states that we 
would not join any military grouping or agree to having foreign 
units enter our territory. So, Austria moves towards the 
European Union as a neutral state and it does not cause any 
problems here or in Brussels. I am glad it is so." 
  Klestil favorably commented on Slovakia joining the Council 
of Europe, and in this context he spoke also about the problems 
surrounding the Hungarian ethnic minority, about the anxiety in 
Slovakia resulting from a statement made once by the deceased 
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall that he regards himself 
as the "spiritual prime minister of all 15 million Hungarians," 
i.e., including the more than 5 million Hungarians living 
abroad. He recommended that a reasonable basis be found for 
talks on these questions, the mistrust and concerns be gradually 
vanquished, and said that it would be good to view these issues 
in a long-term perspective: "If we consider Europe democratic 
and liberal, borders in their present antiquated form have no 
meaning." We observed that such a vision is nice and attractive 
but, unfortunately, at present we still keep encountering the 
tendency to close oneself, which has something to do with the 
advanced and well-to-do Europe apparently is justified in 
fearing millions of people who "sit on their travel bags" and 
contemplate whether it would not be best to set off from their 
country in search of a more stable and better life. The 
Austrian president responded to this, among other things, with 
the following: 
  "The question of mass migration is a significant part of the 
threat presented by today's world. The prosperous countries of 
Europe must offer other countries the hope and prospects of a 
good future so that the local population decides to stay at 
home. Austria is helping refugees. Those coming from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are a real problem for us -- there are 74,000 
of them in Austria officially. We have no idea how many are 
there illegally. Just in Vienna, 8,000 children from Bosnia are 
attending school. What to do about these people? Will they 
integrate into our society?" 
  "The West undoubtedly must help more speedily, efficiently, 
and diversely -- the best help seems to be efficient cooperation 
and investments -- to the countries that are passing through a 
complex transformation process, so that their citizens find 
meaning for their existence and future."

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: "Report: EU Membership Would Make </F>
Environment Protection More Effective; 100 to 300-Meter-Wide 
Ecological Zone Planned for Coast"] 
  [Text] If Finland joins the European Union (EU), the 
effectiveness of protection of the environment would be 
increased in Finland. In its interim report, the committee that 
has been investigating the matter concludes that EU directives 
would require several changes in the laws governing 
environmental protection. 
  According to the directives on the environment, an EU 
country 
must, among other things, sufficiently increase the number of 
nature conservation areas through which the preservation of 
species and the environment are protected. Finland would 
evidently have to increase the number of conservation areas for 
some species and types of natural environment. At least the old 
forests and some environment types in coastal areas would need 
additional protection. 
  The protection of certain environment types would be 
incumbent on Finland since they are not found in the present EU 
area. These are the ragged southern and southwestern coastal 
areas and especially the elevated coast of Pohjanmaa. 
  Finland would have to present its list of areas to be 
protected by as early as 5 June 1995. 
  A member nation may, if it so wishes, protect its 
environment 
more rigorously than required by the environment directive. 
<H5>  Saimaa Ringed Seal Would Benefit </H5>
  The environment directive prescribes that species 
populations 
must be viably preserved and the areas they range in may not be 
reduced. 
  For the Saimaa ringed seal, for example, this would mean 
that 
the future of the population on the south side of Savonlinna 
would have to be protected. At the present time there are 
conservation areas only on the north side -- Linnansaari and 
Kolovesi national parks. 
  Researchers believe that, if the ringed seal group on the 
south side of Savonlinna is not protected, the population of 180 
Saimaa ringed seals will inevitably decline. 
  According to the environment directive, places where 
strictly 
protected species breed and rest must be protected from changes 
that weaken the populations of the species. The regulation also 
applies to activities the side effects of which cause them harm. 
Because of this, the environmental protection law would have to 
be amended since it states that species protection may not 
prevent land from being used for farming or construction. 
<H5>  Big Dispute Over Coast </H5>
  The committee also looked into the effects on the laws of 
the 
general agreement on biodiversity signed in Rio de Janeiro, but 
they are largely the same as the changes required by the EU 
directives. 
  The Environment Committee of the Baltic Protection 
Commission, or Helsinki Commission, has drafted a proposal as to 
how the article governing nature conservation approved in 1992 
for inclusion in the Baltic protection agreement is to be 
applied. The Environment Committee will propose to the 
Commission, which is to meet next March, that a coastal zone 100 
to 300 meters in width from the shoreline into the sea as well 
as inland be protected outside of populated areas. 
  The committee will also recommend that a network of 
protected 
areas be created in coastal and marine areas. Activities that 
alter the natural environment or the landscape, such as the 
construction of buildings and roads, would not as a rule be 
permitted in the protected 100 to 300-meter coastal zone. 
Saunas, boathouses, or wind power plants, for example, could be 
erected in the future as well. A project that is in the public 
interest could also be permitted if a less sensitive area [to 
build in] could not be found. 
  Intensive farming and logging, for example, soil drainage 
and 
clear-cutting, would also be restricted in the zone. 
  Department head Markku Tornberg of the MTK [Agricultural 
Producers Association] criticized the proposal, maintaining that 
the establishment of an ecological zone would drive a huge 
number of Archipelago farms into bankruptcy since their value as 
security [for loans] would plummet. 
  Tornberg made a statement on the interim report. In it he, 
among other things, said that the committee had drawn unfounded 
or overly far-reaching conclusions.

Research Institute Chemistry Department; Lauri Niemisto, special 
investigatgor of the Marine Research Institute Chemistry 
Department, and Professor Ake Niemi, head of the Tvarminne 
zoological research station: "Saltwater Flow Petered Out 
Prematurely; New Discharge of Oxygenated North Sea Saltwater 
Would Work Wonders for Baltic"] 
  [Text] A year ago the Baltic received a sudden flow of 
saltwater. The general interest in environmental affairs led to 
a great deal of publicity about the event in all of the 
countries bordering on the Baltic. In Finland too there was talk 
of the "mother of all saltwater discharges" and an abundance of 
stormy years was predicted. 
  There had, as we know, been saltwater discharges before then 
too, but only a very few researchers knew about their flow and 
its consequences: It was only in January 1993 that the first 
discharge of the information generation entered the Baltic. 
  This whole natural spectacle is incredibly complex. This is 
why a saltwater flow does not just like that lead to big 
harvests of storms, as was the case after some of the earlier 
ones. 
  Five hundred cubic kilometers of freshwater annually enters 
the Baltic catchment area. If salty ocean water from the North 
Sea did not occasionally get into the Baltic, the latter's salt 
content would gradually diminish. 
  Saltwater flows enter it through the Danish straits across a 
low threshold. Since, because of this, it is North Sea surface 
water, it is abundantly supplied with oxygen. But since it 
contains more salt than the water of the Baltic, it is heavier 
and sinks to the depths of the Baltic. 
<H5>  Flows Come at Long Intervals </H5>
  However, water only flows from the North Sea into the Baltic 
under certain conditions. The prerequisites for this are that 
there be an east wind over the straits and that the surface of 
the Baltic be lower than that of the North Sea. 
  Flows into and out of the Baltic usually last only a few 
days 
and the effect of the flows does not extend over a very long 
period. 
  In some years -- usually in winter -- however, a continuous, 
incoming flow is produced that lasts for even weeks on end. Then 
the water coming from the North Sea gets so far into the Baltic 
that it does not get back into the direction of flow into the 
North Sea after turning [at the east end of the Baltic]. 
  Such big water flows occur only a few times in a century, 
but 
their effects are felt for a long time. The last big discharge 
was in the winter of 1975-76. Since then, the salt content of 
the Baltic has been constantly diminishing and that is also why 
the density of the water has been reduced -- the water has 
"gotten lighter." Because of this, a big ocean water discharge 
is increasingly more likely. 
  Oxygen is needed to decompose the plankton. Since the layer 
of water adjacent to the bottom is not renewed, its oxygen is 
depleted. However, oxygen is not the only substance that 
bacteria use to be able to decompose the plankton. The most 
important of the others is saltwater sulphate, which is 
transformed into hydrogen sulfide during this decomposition 
process. 
  Hydrogen sulfide kills nearly every living thing on the sea 
floor. Before the arrival of the saltwater flow, the hydrogen 
sulfide layer extended from the floor of the central basin of 
the Baltic, that is, from a depth of 250 meters, to a depth of 
as little as about 130 meters. 
<H5>  Hydrogen Sulfide Uses Up Oxygen </H5>
  Last February the water surged into the Baltic for about 
three weeks. Danish and Swedish measuring stations estimated 
that the volume of the incoming flow was about 310 cubic 
kilometers. This was one of the "big" discharges of our century. 
  They knew that large amounts of hydrogen sulfide and 
nutrients had accumulated on the floor of the Baltic. They 
feared that this old water would be set in motion and rise to 
the surface in the southern part of the Archipelago Sea and the 
Gulf of Finland, where it would result in a sharp increase in 
algae production. Nevertheless, this did not happen that time. 
What happened? 
  From the standpoint of the heavy incoming mass of water, the 
Baltic develops into a series of basins. After the threshold 
formed by the Danish straits, the water flows into the Arkona 
area, which forms a shallow, flat basin. 
  The mixing of the water was so turbulent in the Arkona that 
it reduced this mother of all discharges to about a third of its 
original size. 
  Some of the water continued on its way into the 
100-meter-deep Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic 
kilometers. 
  From the Bornholm the saltwater flow went on to the central 
basin of the Baltic, the Gotland Basin. The flow moves slowly: 
It took from four to six months to cover this 600-km distance. 
  So, no more than about 100 cubic km of relatively salty and 
oxygen-rich water was reaching the central basin of the Baltic 
in the early summer of 1993. In it there was sea water 
discharged originally from the North Sea into the Baltic and old 
Baltic water from the depths of the Arkona and Bornholm basins. 
  There were 10-12 g/m[.sup]3[/] of oxygen in the North Sea 
surface water, but no more than a third of that oxygen, about 4 
g/m[.sup]3[/], in the water that was entering the central 
basin. So, 100 cubic kilometers of water brought 400,000 tons of 
fresh oxygen into the deep water of the central basin of the 
Baltic. 
  However, a whole basinful, about 250 cubic kilometers, of 
old 
water containing hydrogen sulfide was waiting for the new water. 
There had been time enough for about 5 g/m[.sup]3[/] on 
average, or all told over a million tons, of hydrogen sulfide to 
form. 
  It takes roughly 2 tons of oxygen to convert 1 ton of 
hydrogen sulfide into a harmless form. So, even though an 
abundance of oxygen rolled into the central basin, it could only 
handle a small portion of the hydrogen sulfide that was in the 
basin. 
<H5>  Thresholds Protect Gulf of Bothnia </H5>
  This is why they think that, if a new mass of relatively 
unmixed water rapidly pushes its way into the central basin, it 
may shove the light water in it, which contains a lot of 
hydrogen sulfide, toward the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of 
Finland. 
  The Gulf of Bothnia is protected because the underwater 
thresholds formed by the continuations of the Salpausselka and 
the shallows on the south side of the Aland Sea keep the water 
near the northern [arm of the Baltic] from advancing. 
  Nevertheless, the pressure of the saltwater that entered the 
Baltic in January 1993 was great enough to push the old water 
from the central basin to the floor of the Gulf of Finland. This 
caused a slight drop in sedimentation and oxygen content on the 
bottom. 
  As a result, there will obviously be a shortage of oxygen in 
the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland over the next few years 
and bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. As it rises 
to the surface, this water containing phosphates will probably 
somewhat increase the growth of plankton, especially offshore of 
Hanko and on the eastern side of Suursaari. 
  The production of algae will not, however, accelerate out of 
the ordinary. The future of the Gulf of Finland will continue to 
depend on whether we get the abundant nutrient discharges at the 
eastern end of the Baltic under control. 
<H5>  Flows Come in Successive Years </H5>
  The flow that occurred in January 1993 was already so mixed 
at the start of its journey that the increase in salinity -- and 
hence density -- it caused was not very significant. The water 
of the Baltic deeps is still "light" and the situation is still 
favorable for a new flow. 
  Actually, the situation is an exciting one: The way has been 
cleared for a new flow and there has not been time for the 
hydrogen sulfide to form to any extent. The bulk of a new flow 
will no longer be expended on disposing of the hydrogen sulfide, 
but it will be enough to renew the bottom-dwelling animal 
population. 
  North Sea flows very often come in series, in successive 
years. The disturbance in the rhythm of the water exchange that 
has been going on for nearly two decades also illustrates how 
delicate the oxygen balance in the Baltic is. 
  If there is a continuation of the 1993 flow in the near 
future, we may hope that, after this disturbance in its rhythm 
that has lasted for nearly 20 years now, the water exchange in 
the Baltic will return to its normal beat. 
<H5>  Last Winter's Saltwater Flow Got as Far as Gotland Basin </H5>
  The Baltic needs the saltwater that comes from the North Sea 
through the Danish straits. However, this saltwater flow is only 
rarely strong enough for it to affect the entire Baltic. 
  Last winter the incoming flow lasted three weeks. The last 
big discharge prior to that was in the winter of 1975-76. The 
oxygen of the bottom water layers was exhausted because of the 
long interval between flows. When the oxygen was lacking, 
bacteria produced hydrogen sulfide, which kills nearly every 
form of life, near the sea floor. A year ago there was a layer 
of hydrogen sulfide in the central basin of the Baltic that 
extended to a depth of about 130 meters from the bottom. 
  Last January 310 cubic km of oxygen-rich, North Sea surface 
water entered the Baltic. Since it was salty, it was heavier 
than the water of the Baltic, which is why it advanced along the 
bottom. 
  The water flowed from the Danish straits into the shallow, 
flat Arkona Basin. Some of the water drifted back into the 
Kattegat area and some of it continued on its way into the 
Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic km. Once that 
basin was filled, the excess water went on to the Gotland Basin, 
which received 100 cubic km of fairly salty, oxygenated water. 
This 100 cubic km of water carried with it 400,000 tons of new 
oxygen. Lying in wait for it, however, were 250 cubic km of old 
water containing a million tons of hydrogen sulfide. There was 
not enough oxygen to dispose of all of the hydrogen sulfide. 
  The pressure of the saltwater pushed the old water of the 
Gotland Basin into the Gulf of Finland. The oxygen content on 
the bottom of the latter dropped. 
  Over the next few years there will probably be a shortage of 
oxygen in the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland and 
bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. The growth of 
plankton will probably increase somewhat.

  [Text] According to a report received by the Baltic Sea 
Marine Protection Commission, at least 40,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons and ammunition from World War II were dumped into the 
Baltic Sea. Approximately 13,000 tonnes of this is war 
chemicals. The dumping continued until the end of 1947. In 
addition, the former East Germany dumped 200 tonnes of 
ammunition in the Baltic Sea during the 1950's. The Protection 
Commission is still awaiting more information from Russia about 
the destruction of chemical weapons. According to the report, 
known dumping sites in the Baltic Sea are situated on the 
southeastern side of Gotland [island off Sweden], on the eastern 
side of [the Danish island of] Bornholm, and in the Little Belt 
in the Danish Straits. The report urges the Protection 
Commission to issue general rules for fishermen in case chemical 
weapons get entangled in their catching equipment.

<F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "Krueger: Environment Research Must </F>
Solve Problems"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 9 March -- Government-subsidized 
environmental research is to be increasingly oriented toward 
specific problem- solving and applications. This is the central 
point made in a strategy paper that Research Minister Paul 
Krueger presented in Bonn. In developing future priorities of 
environmental research, politicians want to cooperate with 
science and technology and the users of the research findings. 
In Krueger's view, activities must be better coordinated to 
achieve a more user-oriented environmental research. The 
Christian Democratic Union politician admitted that there are 
shortcomings in adjusting activities among the ministries, the 
research establishments, and industry. This is due to the surge 
in environmental research. Annual government subsidies, 
excluding environment-oriented energy, transport, and 
construction research, have been increased from 250 to 720 
million German marks since 1982. Of these, 50 percent each are 
used for projects and as subsidies for research organizations. 
  Instead of a number of small projects, pilot projects are to 
be established where various fields of science will deal with 
model environmental problems. Institutes shall increasingly 
cooperate with science and producers or users of environmental 
technologies. Germany is the world leader in environmental 
research and technology, Krueger said. He mentioned sewage 
treatment and waste incineration as examples. Over the past few 
years, 1 million jobs were created in environmental 
technology-related industries, and 21 percent of world exports 
came from Germany. 
  In a new environmental research program for 1995 to 1999, 
the 
environment minister wants to set priorities in the fields of 
water circulation and climate as well as environment-friendly 
use of land. In addition, solutions are to be found for avoiding 
problem substances as early as at the research stage and for 
establishing closed circulations of substances. This way 
pollution is to be avoided at the source.

  [Text] The proposed creation of a liability fund for 
illegal waste transportation to be financed by industry, now 
being debated in connection with the incorporation of the Basel 
Convention into German law, has met with considerable criticism 
among representatives of industry and the waste management 
sector. The convention contains provisions on the banning, 
supervision, and monitoring of exports and transportation. An 
Environment Committee hearing held behind closed doors on 2 
February discussed issues relating to the export and disposal of 
hazardous waste and Federal Government bills on the subject. 
  Bayer AG and the federal Hazardous Waste Management and 
German Disposal Industry associations raised constitutional 
objections to a "consumer-oriented [as published] liability fund 
at federal level" proposed by the Bundesrat and other bodies. A 
solidarity fund of this type would only make sense, the 
Hazardous Waste Management Association claimed, if all the 
economic sectors involved in export procedures were cited as 
potential culprits. The best method of avoiding illegal exports 
remained monitoring by the laender. 
  The Disposal Industry Association maintained that before 
founding a "waste recovery solidarity fund," it should first be 
established whether a liability incumbent in principle on the 
state could be replaced by a fund financed by industry. 
According to the Basel Convention and the European regulation 
on transportation, "subsidiary state liability" applied to 
illegal exports. Such a fund would be conceivable only in the 
form of an organization under civil law that all waste 
transporters could join, like the "Motor Vehicle Accident 
Compensation Fund." It would have to be possible to sue illegal 
traders, but the fund should not have to pay for "exports 
determined at the political level." Bayer considered a fund 
arrangement "unfair," because legal waste conveyers would be 
accepting joint liability for illegal waste exporters, and it 
would contradict the principle embodied in the European waste 
directive whereby the culprit had to pay. 
  North Rhine-Westphalia's Environment Ministry and the 
Greenpeace environmental organization, on the other hand, would 
welcome a culprit-oriented liability arrangement. The 
Environment Ministry spoke out in no uncertain terms against 
costs being borne out of public funds in accordance with the 
subsidiarity principle and in favor of risk distribution with 
costs shared by the waste management sector. This, it said, 
seemed reasonable, as it would enhance the waste disposal 
operators' sense of responsibility. Greenpeace basically 
welcomed the introduction of a fund, although a solution that 
obliged each of the 16 federal laender to set up an individual 
fund and laid responsibility on the land where the waste came 
from as unrealistic and unfair. This would place the Hanseatic 
cities, the laender with a North Sea seaboard, and the eastern 
federal laender at a distinct disadvantage and overburden them. 
The organization also pressed for a comprehensive export ban, 
especially to developing countries.

Waste Threatens New Laender"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- According to the Ecological Institute in 
Darmstadt, hundreds of thousands of people in southern Saxony 
and Thuringia are subjected to dangerous radiation from the 
waste of GDR uranium mining. A study which was published 
yesterday shows that more than 1 billion tonnes of radioactively 
contaminated waste would have to be safely disposed. 
  The wastes, which contain radium, constantly release radon. 
This leads to about six deaths from radiation per year just in 
the east Thuringian area of Ronneburg, radiation biologist 
Gerhard Schmidt from Darmstadt says. He called on the Federal 
Government to quickly fulfill its legal duty to dispose of the 
waste, because otherwise there would be unjustifiable long-term 
effects. 
  According to the institute, there have been 5,000 
job-related 
deaths at the Wismut corporation since the beginning of uranium 
mining in 1945. Over 40 years the Soviet Union gained about 
220,000 tonnes of uranium from the ore in the south of the 
former GDR as basic material for its military and civilian 
nuclear program. According to estimates by the Darmstadt 
institute, the defusing of the environmental bomb will cost far 
more than the so far assumed 15 billion marks.

  [Excerpts] "The Chernobyl accident has had greater 
consequences for Norway than first anticipated," Per Strand, a 
researcher at the National Radiation Protection Board said. 
  "The effects of the radioactive fallout will last longer, 
and 
a larger amount of radioactive substances will be absorbed by 
vegetation and animals in the vulnerable outlying grazing 
grounds than we estimated in 1986," the researcher said. 
[passage omitted] 
  "The authorities have set an upper limit for the amount of 
radiation permitted in foodstuffs before they take special 
measures. Foodstuffs produced in some of the heavily polluted 
outlying areas will register above the limit well into the next 
century unless we continue our special countermeasures," Strand 
said. 
<H5>  Information </H5>
  One of the measures has been to provide information to 
segments of the population that are subject to serious exposure 
about how often they can eat reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
game from the affected areas. Another measure has been to give a 
substance that binds cesium to animals that have grazed in these 
areas or to put the animals on nonradioactive feed for a while 
before they are slaughtered. 
  "The level of radiation, and consequently the health risks, 
have been significantly reduced because of these measures. For 
the population as a whole, the risk has been halved. For 
reindeer-herding Samis in south and central Norway the risk has 
been reduced to one-tenth. The Chernobyl incident means a very 
slight increase in cancer risk for the population, but those 
groups that eat a lot of reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
mushrooms from the areas that experienced great radioactive 
fallout will have an increased risk of cancer if countermeasures 
are not taken. This applies above all to Samis that are reindeer 
herders. With the use of countermeasures it is expected that one 
in 1,000 in this group will develop cancer. Without 
countermeasures, the number would be one in 100." 
<H5>  500 Cancer Cases </H5>
  "It is estimated that about 500 Norwegians will develop 
cancer in the next 50 years as a result of the radiation from 
Chernobyl. (Annually 10,000 Norwegians die of cancer stemming 
from other causes.) We might expect 80-90 cases of genetic 
damage in Norway. There has not been any increase in reports of 
fetal damage in Norway, but a small increase in spontaneous 
abortions was recorded shortly after the accident," Strand said.

<F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Environmental Research in </F>
Danger: Contribution to EU May Force Reductions"] 
  [Text] Swedish environmental research is in danger of large 
cutbacks as Sweden moves closer to the EU [European Union]. 
Sweden's contribution to the EU's research program will eat up 
more than half of the National Environmental Protection Board's 
appropriation for environmental research here at home. 
  This is what Erik Fellenius, head of research at the 
National 
Environmental Protection Board (SNV), says. He believes that 
the government should distribute the EU payment to more Swedish 
authorities and research councils that finance research on the 
environment. 
<H5>  Increased Influence </H5>
  In 1992, when Rolf Annerberg, the general director of the 
National Environmental Protection Board, turned his 
environmental research study in to the government, SNV warned 
that national environmental research goals could not be achieved 
within the budget framework that the government set at that time 
for environmental research. 
  Two years ago, 20 million from SNV's budget went to the EU 
research program "Environment." In fiscal year 1995-96, between 
70 and 100 million kronor from of SNV's total purse of 155 
million will go to research projects decided upon by the EU. 
  "Even if we get increased influence over the EU's research 
program, we cannot be sure that Sweden's special research needs 
will be satisfied. At issue are research on acidification, the 
salmon disease M74, and other things. The research program that 
we need to form a basis for arguments in international 
environmental negotiations is in danger of suffering serious 
reductions," says Erik Fellenius. 
<H5>  Spread the Contribution </H5>
  He believes the government should distribute the EU 
contribution to more Swedish financiers, for example the 
Business and Technical Development Board (Nutek), the Science 
Research Council, and the Forestry and Agricultural Research 
Council.

<F P=106> [Charles Clover report: "Nuclear Waste Review Likely To </F>
Delay Sell-off"] 
  [Text] Plans for disposing of nuclear waste, much of it in 
temporary storage at sites around Britain, are to be reviewed, 
possibly delaying privatisation of the nuclear power industry. 
  The plans were strongly criticised by the Government's chief 
safety adviser last year. 
  Mr. Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, who 
has indicated that he wanted to see privatisation before the 
next election, has been pressing for what some officials call a 
"short and dirty" review. 
  This would focus narrowly on the potential commercial 
viability of privatised Pressurised Water Reactors and would 
report by the summer. 
  But Mr. John Gummer, Environment Secretary, is adamant that 
the review should cover both long-term liabilities from 
decommissioning nuclear plants -- costing an estimated 20 
billion pounds -- and plans for disposing of nuclear power waste. 
  A remit for the waste review, to be carried out by the 
Department of the Environment, has been long delayed but is now 
expected within weeks. The review would be expected to take 
until the end of the year. 
  Yet some industry observers say Mr. Heseltine must take a 
decision this summer on the sell-off of Nuclear Electric and 
Scottish Nuclear if privatisation is to happen before the next 
election. 
  It was uncertainty about the scale of long-term liabilities 
that led to the nuclear industry being dropped from 
privatisation in 1989. 
  The waste review is likely to focus on plans of the nuclear 
waste agency, Nirex, for a 3 billion pound national nuclear 
waste dump at Sellafield -- and how realistic these are. These 
plans have slipped from around 2003 to after 2010 while waste 
continues to mount at Magnox power stations. 
  The review is also likely to look at costs and strategies 
for 
decommissioning nuclear power stations, many of them closing in 
the next 10 years. This alone will cost up to 10 billion 
pounds. Other liabilities, including disposing of Atomic Energy 
Authority sites and British Nuclear Fuels, bring the total 
closer to 20 billion pounds. 
  Final disposal of waste, which environmentalists say has 
never been properly planned, is expected to cost more than that 
but has never been fully costed. 
  The recent approval given for the British Nuclear Fuels 
Thorp 
plant will probably mean that a lot of extra waste is likely to 
be generated, with nowhere for it to go. 
  Last autumn Prof. John Horlock, departing chairman of the 
Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations, 
criticised the quantities of waste piling up at power stations 
and nuclear stores. He called on the Government to ensure that 
the Nirex waste repository proposed for Sellafield came into 
operation earlier than 2010. 
  It is not known if the review will cover reprocessing or dry 
storage. If it were to do so, it would be a new blow to British 
Nuclear Fuels which has just won a 16-year battle to open its 
Thorp reprocessing plant: dry storage is seen by many as a 
cheaper option than reprocessing. 
  Nuclear analysts reacted without surprise to the news of a 
nuclear waste review. 
  Mr. Gordon MacKerron, senior fellow at the Science Policy 
Research Unit at Sussex University, said: "There is a clear 
public perception that our nuclear waste disposal policy is in a 
complete mess." 
  "Nuclear Electric will want the Government to clear up all 
the historic liabilities because it is clear that the City does 
not want to take them on." 
  A spokesman for Nuclear Electric disputed whether a waste 
review would mean delay for privatisation.

<F P=106> [Christine McGourty report: "Sea Fails To Soak Up Greenhouse </F>
Gases"] 
  [Text] An ocean process that absorbs 20 per cent of 
man-made emissions of carbon dioxide has broken down. 
  Oceanographers on a three-month expedition to the Greenland 
Sea have found a significant reduction in "deep convection" -- 
the process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is 
transported to the sea bed. 
  Dr. Peter Wadhams of the Scott Polar Research Institute, 
leader of the expedition, said yesterday the decline was 
"disturbing and surprising." 
  "Convection in the Greenland Sea has virtually stopped in 
the 
last decade," he told Oceanology International, a marine science 
conference in Brighton. 
  "It is a process that has been going on for several thousand 
years and when you see it decline sharply over a decade it gets 
you worried." 
  The process was "a plughole" for carbon dioxide and its 
decline could leave more of the gas in the atmosphere, 
increasing global warming through the greenhouse effect, he said. 
  It occurs in only four places -- the Greenland Sea, the 
Labrador Sea, the Weddell Sea in Antarctica and in the western 
Mediterranean. 
  Dense surface water sinks to the sea bed, taking carbon 
dioxide with it. 
  Except in the Mediterranean, the process begins when ice 
sheets expand in the winter. As ice forms, salt is rejected 
into the water, making it more dense and forcing it deeper. 
  On last year's expedition, oceanographers studied the 
process 
at the Odden Ice Tongue -- an unusual ice sheet about 100 miles 
long and 50 miles wide in the Greenland Sea. 
  "Convection there is dependent on ice forming," said Dr. 
Wadhams. "But in recent years not enough ice has been forming." 
This itself could be a result of global warming, he added. 
  Measurements of salinity and temperature taken from the 
expedition's four research ships showed that convection took 
place to a depth of only 3,000 feet last year, compared with 
6,000 feet five years ago. 
  Ten years ago convection took place all the way down to the 
sea bed -- 12,000 feet.

"Satellite To Track Sheep in Hunt for Radiation"] 
  [Text] Scientists have harnessed space technology in an 
attempt to rid sheep in the United Kingdom of radioactive 
contamination from the Chernobyl disaster. 
  About 500,000 sheep in Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales 
are still affected by the fall out from the 1986 explosion. 
  They plan to fit transmitters to scores of animals so they 
can be tracked by satellite wherever they are on the remote 
hills and moors. Each back-pack strapped to the sheep contains a 
microcomputer, transmitter and receiver. 
  The packs not only record the sheep's exact position but 
also 
every jaw movement. Researchers can tell when the animals are 
feeding and when they are simply ruminating. The aim is to find 
the remaining "hot-spots" of radiation. 
  More than 500 UK farms are still subject to movement 
restrictions on their flocks almost eight years after the 
explosion at the Russian plant. 
  The worst affected area is Wales where about 230,000 sheep 
on 
340 farms are affected by legislation preventing their meat from 
being sold until they have been checked by government scientists. 
  Many sheep, even those born long after the Chernobyl 
disaster, are still eating radiocaesium in vegetation growing on 
contaminated soil. 
  Now, after successful trials with a satellite-based Global 
Positioning System developed for the United States Defence 
Department, scientists at the Institute of Grassland and 
Environmental Research at Northwyke, Devon and the Institute of 
Terrestrial Ecology at Merlewood, Cumbria, are ready to tackle 
the contaminated farms.

<F P=106> [Article by Roger Highfield, science editor: "Sellafield: </F>
Who Is Hit If the Worst Happens?"] 
  [Text] It hasn't happened yet. But should an accident occur 
at Sellafield, the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, the 
path of a radioactive cloud across Britain can be plotted 
instantly. 
  The hypothetical "footprint" of pollution caused by a leak 
and borne on prevailing winds can now be predicted using a 
computer model. And a couple of days can make all the difference 
between radioactive fall-out spreading over Scandinavia, or 
falling in Britain's back yard. 
  A small-scale version can also reveal how the location and 
height of a smokestack at a chemical plant affects local 
pollution. "We could predict five days ahead when there will be 
a problem with a factory," said Robert Chadwick, environmental 
product manager at the Meteorological Office, which has 
developed the model. 
  The Met Office hopes to use the model, which can incorporate 
weather forecasts, as a tool to predict air quality, such as the 
risk of ozone or nitrogen dioxide pollution under certain 
weather conditions. 
  When the Met Office unveils its new generation of computer 
models next month, Whitehall, local councils, pressure groups 
and environmentalists are expected to show interest in the 
predictions, which can be produced for as little as &pound;250. 
  The Government will rely on the computer model to highlight 
areas at risk from acid rain across the globe, and to predict 
the fall-out in the event of a catastrophic nuclear accident. 
  The Met Office's Nuclear Accident Response Model has shown, 
for instance, that the radioactive plume released by a nuclear 
accident is diluted more during a hot day in summer than a cold 
night in winter. The distance the plume of radioactivity travels 
can depend on the presence of a faster, mobile, non-turbulent 
layer of air above the explosion. At night, the cool still air 
can make this layer a few metres thick, while it could be as 
much as a mile on a summer afternoon, enabling the plume to 
travel a long way. 
  The model was developed in the wake of the world's worst 
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in 1986, when it became clear 
that there was a need for a way to assess the risks to the 
public created by an airborne plume of radioactivity. A 
smattering of dots moving across a computer screen can aid 
crisis management by showing how radioactivity spreads, or the 
effect of smoke sent up by a major fire or volcano. 
  "Just select your accident and we can forecast the effects," 
said Roy Maryon, one of its developers. 
  In the case of Chernobyl, it took a few days before the 
world 
was aware of the accident. Now "hindcasts" based on weather 
patterns can track the pollution over five days from the moment 
of release. 
  The computer was put through its paces by Noel Nelson and 
Karl Kitchen, who helped to develop the model. They simulated a 
nuclear accident at Sellafield -- site of the western world's 
worst leak, in 1957, when it was known as Windscale. 
  They chose two different days last month to stage a 
hypothetical nuclear accident, and after the computer had 
processed the relevant weather data it plotted the gradual 
spread of radioactive particles across a map. Had the accident 
occurred on January 15, within three days north-easterly winds 
would have wafted the pollution by turns across southern 
Ireland, Wales, the West Midlands, the south coast as far east 
as Brighton, then Devon, Cornwall and the coasts of northern 
France. 
  By January 18, the winds had turned towards the east. "We 
see 
a plume passing across the country to the North Sea," Mr. Nelson 
said. Had this been the date when a leak began, only the 
north-east coast of Britain would have received fall-out, while 
Scandinavia would have felt the effects 48 hours later. 
  Other computer plots show how radioactivity would have been 
washed out of the atmosphere by rain, creating distinct areas 
where fall-out would concentrate. Within 36 hours of the January 
15 emission, the worst hotspots would have been in northern 
France, with most of Wales and the West Midlands almost as badly 
hit. 
  Mr. Chadwick said he could have done with such a warning in 
1986, when he was rained on as Chernobyl's plume passed overhead. 
  The Met Office's computer model contains details of nuclear 
plants across the planet. It is also linked to a national 
radiation monitoring network, called Rimnet, so that its 
predictions can be checked and refined. A major European 
experiment, Etex, will be conducted this year to see how well 20 
such computer models predict the movement of an inert tracer gas 
released from Brittany. 
  The model is already part of the Department of the 
Environment's emergency plan for nuclear accidents.

  [Text] Florence, Italy, March 12 (AFP) -- Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi opened an environmental meeting of the 
seven richest industrialized nations here Saturday [12 March] 
warning that population growth increasingly threatened the 
world's ecology. 
  "When one thinks that one-tenth of the world population, 
concentrated in the G7 countries, consumes about two-thirds of 
the available energy, it is easy to imagine what a destructive 
effect the pressure of a growing population has on the 
environment and rare resources," Ciampi said. 
  "If the developing countries go on, in an uncontrolled 
manner, to achieve the same level of consumption as us, how many 
other planets will we need in addition to Earth?" he added. 
  Environment ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Japan, Italy, and the United States are attending the two-day 
meeting.

  [Text] Florence, Italy, March 13 (AFP) -- Environmental 
protection schemes could provide jobs for more than two million 
people in the recession-hit seven most industrialized countries, 
their environmental ministers said here Sunday [13 March]. 
  At an informal meeting, held unusually ahead of a summit of 
the G7 countries scheduled for July, the ministers said they 
were convinced environmental projects could generate 2.1 million 
jobs in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the 
United States. 
  They agreed that preservation of nature could be financed by 
"environmental accounting" or better distribution of taxes. 
  "No one talked about creating new taxes," said Italian 
Environmental Minister Valdo Spini at the end of the two-day 
meeting. 
  French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said Europe must 
"implement such reforms together," noting that "pollution has no 
boundaries." 
  On safety at nuclear plants, particularly in Central and 
Eastern Europe, the ministers pledged to "promote aid and 
economic and technological assistance to countries with the 
biggest problems." 
  They also discussed the greenhouse effect -- or warming up 
of 
the earth's climate through pollution -- as well as 
deforestation, desertification and water pollution. 
  G7 heads of government and state are to meet in July in 
Naples.

<F P=106> [Report by Lidiya Ivchenko: "Education Is the Most Reliable </F>
Means of Combating AIDS at Present"] 
  [Text] World AIDS Day has been marked for the sixth time, 
drawing universal attention to the terrible disease which has 
struck at least 14-15 million inhabitants of the planet. 
  It is no coincidence that such attention has been devoted to 
AIDS: It is a disease of young people, and its wide spread, 
first, threatens to cause the degeneration of the human race 
and, second, is a heavy economic burden upon society. Treatment 
for AIDS, which can, at best, only prolong life somewhat, is 
very expensive -- according to U.S. estimates, approximately 
$80,000 a year. The disease is still incurable, with the 
majority of patients dying within five to 10 years despite all 
the efforts of medicine, and at present just one reliable means 
exists against it -- people's education. Information and 
literacy relating to all aspects of the problem -- this is one 
condition for prevention. 
  This is why medics urge the press and representatives of 
various organizations, including religious ones, to assist them 
in propaganda and educational work in everything concerning AIDS. 
  In Russia, as is well known, the incidence of infection with 
HIV is considerably lower than in the West. In the opinion of 
Vadim Pokrovskiy, leader of the Russian Center for the 
Prevention and Combating of AIDS, its slower pace is connected 
with our society's considerable isolation in the eighties. The 
situation is changing now. This year 80 cases of infection with 
AIDS have been registered. 
  "This infection is now recorded in 53 of Russia's 88 
administrative territories," Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of 
the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said. "This year 32 
people have passed from the infected category to the sick 
category -- as is well known, AIDS develops slowly, and it takes 
several years for the disease to show itself. In all, we have 
registered 692 cases of AIDS infection since 1987, 124 people 
have fallen ill, and 96 have died. During the same time 435 
HIV-positive foreign citizens have been detected and deported." 
  Much has been done in Russia in recent years to organize the 
struggle against AIDS. Precisely 748 diagnostic laboratories 
are operating, and the Russian Scientific Methods Center, six 
regional centers, 73 territorial centers, and 128 anonymous 
screening clinics have been set up. 
  A federal targeted program for 1993-1995 to prevent the 
spread of AIDS was adopted this year. Despite all the economic 
difficulties, its funding will begin in December. The draft law 
"On Preventing AIDS Sickness" has been prepared and is already 
being examined. 
  How has the Russian public charitable organization 
"Association for Combating AIDS" marked World AIDS Day? 
  "We have published AIDS references for physicians and 
distributed them to many medical establishments in the country," 
Yu. Malyutin, the association's responsible secretary, said. "A 
collection of articles for middle-level medical workers has been 
published, as well as masses of brochures, booklets, and other 
literature which is being distributed free to the population. 
Two special editions of MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA devoted to the 
problem of preventing HIV infection have been published, and an 
amateur talent competition for medical establishment students on 
the subject of 'All About AIDS and Drugs' has been held in 
conjunction with Moscow's Main Medical Administration. The 
students' best works -- posters, wall newspapers, photographs -- 
are being exhibited in the Satirikon Theater."

  [Text] Our first item today is a rather unusual one. It's 
about AIDS and the Russian Army. Here, as usual, is our science 
correspondent Boris Belitskiy. 
  Belitskiy: Well, this is, of course, a delicate 
subject. But still, we managed to obtain the main facts from 
Colonel (Viktor Kolkov), the chief medical officer at the 
Defense Ministry. 
  Col. (Kolkov) told us that there are today no cases of full- 
blown AIDS in the Armed Forces. However, 15 Army men have 
tested HIV-positive since 1989. 
  Five of them continue to serve in the forces, but are under 
constant medical supervision and have to take laboratory tests 
regularly. The others have been discharged or else seconded to 
civilian institutions, where they continue to be under medical 
surveillance. 
  The colonel believes there's a fairly high risk of infection 
among Army men, especially when they are sent to regions with a 
high incidence of the disease, or when wounded or sick men have 
to take drugs that contain donor blood. 
  As for an official policy of the military authorities 
towards 
infected army men, there doesn't seem to be such a policy, as 
far as we could ascertain. In practice, there are no 
restrictions of any kind on the service of those who test 
HIV-positive. Dismissal is the result, not of the diagnosis, 
but of the general impairment of health that follows infection, 
making further service in the forces impossible. In future, 
however, I wouldn't rule out a stiffening of this policy, as the 
number of infected people in the Army increases parallel with 
such an increase in society.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] A Russian academician has publicly 
denied a Canadian film's charges that he offered human organs 
for sale. A Russian press report gives detailed explanations 
why the accusations are medically and logistically improbable. 
  In a KOMMERSANT-DAILY article (23 Nov 93), Academician 
Valeriy Shumakov, the director of the Public Health Ministry's 
Scientific Research Institute for Transplantology and Artificial 
Organs, denies a Canadian film's claims that he offered human 
body parts for export. Shumakov calls the allegations an attempt 
to discredit Russian transplant specialists, who are beginning 
to attract patients from Europe. 
  The film "Body Parts Business," which was broadcast on 
British and Canadian television in November 1993, urges 
international organizations to stop an alleged international 
black market in human body parts. According to a 25 November 
1993 TRUD article, which takes its information from a report in 
the Belgian newspaper LE SOIR, the film alleges that organs 
procured from Russian kidnap victims, corpses in Moscow morgues, 
missing Honduran children, and Argentinian psychiatric patients 
and accident victims are being sold for transplantation or 
cosmetology research. 
  TRUD, seconded by the Moscow newspaper KOMMERSANT-DAILY (23 
November 93), says that the Canadian film describes large-volume 
sales of body parts for hard currency in Russia. Allegedly one 
firm sold 600 kidneys at 20,000 rubles apiece, and a second 
company sold 700 kidneys, hearts, and lungs; 2,000 eyes and 
3,000 pairs of testicles. The film reportedly asserts that most 
of these organs are taken from unclaimed corpses in morgues, but 
some are removed from kidnapped Russians by rings of doctors 
working in well-guarded, secret locations. The contraband 
organs are reportedly shipped out of Sheremetyevo airport under 
forged documents. As reported in the KOMMERSANT-DAILY article, 
the BBC broadcast of the film included allegations by Bernard 
Cohen, director of Eurotransplant, a Netherlands-based 
organization that distributes organs to European transplant 
clinics, that Shumakov offered to sell him Russian organs. 
  Shumakov, an eminent transplant surgeon, USSR State Prize 
laureate, hero of socialist labor, and academician of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, says that the rumor is an 
attempt by "certain forces in the West ... to compromise Russian 
transplantology because the entry of Russian surgeons into the 
international market would inflict significant injury on their 
Western colleagues" (KOMMERSANT-DAILY 23 Nov 93). Shumakov says 
that his institute collaborated for one year with Eurotransplant 
at Cohen's initiative. According to Shumakov, "relations became 
complicated" when the German physicians' association protested 
the possibility of a group of German patients undergoing 
transplant surgery in the Russian Federation (KOMMERSANT-DAILY). 
DER SPIEGEL and other Western publications had previously 
created a "similar scandal," according to Shumakov, who says the 
negative press reports caused a decline in Russian organ 
donations. 
  In KOMMERSANT-DAILY Shumakov denies charges that he 
participated in kidnappings for the purpose of obtaining organs 
from the victims. He admits that he shipped human body parts 
abroad but not vital organs, not for compensation, and only 
after failing to find a suitable Russian recipient. He 
expresses great doubt that such a black market could exist, 
because vital organs taken from morgues are unsuitable for 
transplantation. Organs must be delivered rapidly after 
removal, and "it would practically be necessary to corrupt an 
entire hospital" to conduct the illegal trade. Shumakov says 
his institute's only commercial venture is surgery on foreign 
patients which generates hard currency to finance 
surgery for Russian patients. 
  While the TRUD article relates the film's contents without 
analysis, KOMMERSANT-DAILY accompanies its report with a pair of 
side bars that reinforce Shumakov's denials. In one, Anatoliy 
Sutyko, director of the All-Russian Center for Kidney 
Transplantation states that he has not encountered any 
violations of the law in decades of work in this field and notes 
that the issue of body part thefts did not arise at the Sixth 
European Congress of the Society of Transplantologists, held in 
October in Greece. Sutyko says that donors are selected in 
accordance with Russian Federation Health Ministry instructions, 
which require the formation of a special committee and prohibit 
removal of organs before the heart stops. According to Sutyko, 
creation of a criminal ring would require enlisting some 25 
physicians from a very small group of qualified specialists. He 
further asserts that tissue compatibility testing, which 
involves taking lymphocytes from the spleen, essentially 
eliminates the possibility of anonymous organ donations. A 
second sidebar quotes a Moscow official's assertion that the 
Moscow police have discovered no corpses of missing persons with 
organs removed. It also summarizes the recently enacted Russian 
Federation Law on Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues, 
which prohibits their purchase and sale and requires donor 
consent. 
  Illegal exports of human body parts from former Soviet 
republics have been reported previously in the Russian media. 
According to Shumakov, the accusations against him were 
previously raised on the television program "Black Box" and 
circulated in the press for two or three years. A 27 April 1993 
TRUD article reported that the Kherson Center for Scientific and 
Technical Services in Ukraine sent 655 kilograms of human bones 
and muscles to Flark Medical, Inc. in Miami Beach during a 
two-month period in 1992. The exports came to light when 
Ukrainian customs officials inspected one of the enterprise's 
shipments and found the export license suspicious. Issued by 
Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister L. Steshenko in 1991 
for 1000 transplants worth $600,000, the license not only lacked 
the required signatures, originator's name, and specific 
consignee address but also listed a Russian customs office, 
Sheremetyevo. Legal specialists say the license is invalid 
because human transplants are not subject to licensing under 
Ukrainian law. In the judgement of an oblast public 
prosecutor's office representative, who is quoted in the 
article, the export scheme was apparently developed to take 
advantage of the lack of a Ukrainian law on transplants. 
  Other reports of organ exports from former Soviet republics 
have appeared in the foreign press. The HONG KONG CHRONICLE 
alleged that Armenians have been smuggling kidneys to Hong Kong

  [Text] Expenditures on health care dropped in 1992 for the 
first time in 30 years. Total spending on health care amounted 
to 44.6 billion markkas, which was 200 million less than what 
was spent in 1991. 
  Based on GNP, health care spending was 9.4 percent more than 
the OECD average. The share for health care had grown because 
GNP dropped in 1992 by 4 percent, and since GNP continued 
dropping last year, the share for health care expenditures 
apparently grew again in 1993. In 1991, the average for OECD 
countries was 8 percent; the figure has not yet been calculated 
for 1992. 
  Hospital care was cut most. The reason for this was 
increased 
outpatient care and reductions in capacity. There was also a 
drop in the number of health care workers. Seventy percent of 
inpatient costs go for personnel items. 
  Forty-four percent of health care costs, or 19.5 billion 
markkas, went for inpatient care, and 15.6 billion on outpatient 
care. A total of 4.8 billion was spent on medicines, and 2.14 
billion was paid out through the health insurance scheme as 
medicine reimbursements. 
  Investments in health care dropped by 20 percent. 
  The state paid 35 percent of health care costs, 
municipalities 33 percent, and 11 percent by the National 
Pension System. Households, or services users, paid only 17 
percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Marese McDonagh: "AIDS Toll Climbs to 376 for </F>
Year"] 
  [Text] The number of AIDS cases rose by 22 percent to 376 
this year, of which 174 have died, 37 of them since January 1. 
  Statistics released by the Department of Health yesterday 
showed eight new cases of AIDS had been reported since October 
31, while there had been two deaths since then. 
  The eight new cases were classified as five intravenous drug 
abusers, two heterosexuals and one homosexual/bisexual. The two 
who died were a heterosexual and a drug addict. 
  The IV drug user category now accounts for 168 (45 percent) 
of those who have contracted full-blown AIDS, while 122 people 
(32 percent) are classed as homosexual/bisexuals. 
  The figures showed 21,219 people underwent tests for HIV 
antibodies for insurance reasons up to November 30, of which one 
tested positive. 
  A total of 77,991 tests were carried out up to the end of 
last month, of which 1,442 tested positive, an increase of 12 
positive cases in just one month. 
  Drug abusers represented just over half of the positive 
cases, homosexuals 19 percent and heterosexuals 13 percent. 
  The stated reason for 8,991 of the tests was visa requests 
and one of these tested positive. 
  None of the 1,804 hospital or "occupational hazard" staff 
tested had a positive result while 96 of the 1,236 in the 
"children at risk" category tested positive. 
  Up to the end of last month, six babies born to drug abusers 
had died of AIDS-related illnesses and there were 17 deaths in 
the haemophiliac category.

"Bill for Managing NHS grows 18-Fold Over Seven Years"] 
  [Text] The cost of managing the National Health Service has 
risen more than 18-fold since 1987 and the total cost of 
administering it has topped &pound;3 billion for the first time, 
according to Department of Health figures. 
  They show that the cost of NHS management rose from 
&pound;25.7 
million in 1987 to &pound;494.2 million this year -- an increase 
of 
&pound;468 million or 1,800 per cent. 
  An analysis of the figures by Labour show that annual 
bureaucratic costs -- including administration, clerical and 
management costs -- have risen over the same period from 
&pound;1.44 billion to &pound;3.02 billion, an increase of 110 
percent. 
  The proportion of spending on administration, clerical and 
management costs has risen from 8.7 percent of the total NHS 
budget in England in 1987-88 to 10.8 percent in 1992-93. 
  Mr. David Blunkett, Labour Shadow Health Secretary, claimed 
that greater bureaucracy and increased administrative costs were 
a direct result of the introduction of the internal market -- 
the commercialised contracting system within the NHS. 
  He said it had been commonly accepted before the 
Conservatives came to office that NHS management and 
administrative costs amounted to about six percent of total NHS 
spending. 
  "A rise to nearly 11 percent over 15 years is a staggering 
indictment of the Conservatives mismanagement and misuse of 
resources." 
  A spokesman for the Department of Health said that Mr. 
Blunkett was only looking at the "input" side of NHS statistics 
without considering the output it achieved. 
  He said: "For every 100 patients treated in hospital before 
the reforms, the NHS now treats 115 and it will rise to 120 next 
year. The NHS spends &pound;100 million every day and if it is to 
treat more patients and improve the quality of care, the money 
has to be properly used and management plays a vital role in 
that process." 
  Mrs. Bottomley argues that the increase in management is 
caused to some extent by staff such as senior nurses being 
re-designated as managers under the reforms. 
  She also says the Government has acted decisively to cut 
bureaucracy -- regional health authorities are about to be 
abolished with the loss of 2,000 staff. District health 
authorities, totalling 192 a few years ago, are already down to 
145 and will fall to only 94 in coming years. 
  In a counterblast to Mr. Blunkett's comments she accused 
Labour of failing to produce a promised document on its health 
policy: "Instead of attacking the health service, Labour should 
deploy their time explaining how they would match the 
improvements in the quality and quantity of patient care 
achieved under the Conservative reforms." 
  The skirmish between the two parties is in preparation for a 
Parliamentary debate today initiated by Labour on the level of 
NHS bureaucracy.

<F P=106> [Article: "10,600 NHS Hospital Beds Are Closed"] </F>
  [Text] More than 10,600 beds in NHS hospitals and trusts in 
England were closed last year, according to department of Health 
figures. Since 1981, the number of beds has fallen by more than 
120,000, a decrease of 34 percent. 
  The number of hospital beds fell from 242,000 in 1991-92 to 
231,363 in 1992-93,a drop by 4.4 percent. 
  South West Thames regional health authority suffered the 
largest loss of beds, a total of 1,713, followed by West 
Midlands RHA which lost 1,555 and South Western RHA which lost 
1,149. 
  Mr. David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, said: "These 
figures confirm what we all suspected. The NHS is slowly being 
whittled away. We now know why patients have to wait so long for 
treatment or on trolleys in the corridors of hospitals. 
  "It is appalling that nearly 11,000 beds can be lost in just 
one year. When is the Secretary of State going to provide for 
the million people on the waiting list?" 
  Dr. Brian Mawhinney, Health Minister, said Mr Blunkett was 
confusing the number of beds in the NHS with the number of 
patients treated but there was no correlation between the two. 
  The number of patients treated was increasing because the 
length of time they stayed in hospital was dropping and GP's 
were carrying out more minor surgical procedures. 
  -- An extra &pound;83 will be available for health spending 
on 
each household as a result of planned increases in NHS spending 
in the coming financial year, Mrs. Bottomley, Health Secretary, 
says today in a New Year message to health service staff.

Warned on Ethics as Bottomley Issues New Code"] 
  [Text] Health service chairmen, chief executives and other 
board members are being warned not to use their positions to 
further personal business interests in new codes of conduct 
aimed at eliminating financial scandals. 
  The highest standards of accountability, probity and 
financial control must operate in the NHS, said Virginia 
Bottomley, the Health Secretary, yesterday. 
  The new guidelines have been introduced following the 
Cadbury 
report on corporate governance and financial scandals in the 
Wessex and West Midlands health authorities which drew criticism 
from the Audit Commission and the Public Accounts Committee. 
  As predicted, the codes call for the setting up of a special 
committee by each health board to consider thee remuneration of 
chief executives and other senior officers. A recent study 
criticised the pay of some chief executives, with reports that 
the chief executive of one trust hospital in London received a 
package worth around &pound;130,000 a year. 
  Health authority and trust members are reminded to keep a 
strict curb on using taxpayers' money for hospitality, and to 
refuse excessive hospitality from suppliers. 
  "Chairmen and board members should act impartially and 
should 
not be influenced by social and business relationships," say the 
guidelines. 
  The codes set down clearer definitions of the functions of 
chairmen and non-executive board members, a requirement to 
establish remuneration committees, and a duty by members of NHS 
boards to declare private interests relevant to NHS business. 
  The remuneration of chairman, executive and non-executive 
board members must be published in annual reports. 
  At a press conference to launch the guidelines, Mrs. 
Bottomley said excessive pay deals to chief executives would not 
be tolerated, but in some cases it might be possible to justify 
high salaries if better care to patients resulted. 
  David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the new rules 
would do little to raise standards to accountability in the NHS. 
  "Most right-thinking people would have assumed that all the 
suggestions being made would already be in place. They will be 
appalled to discover they are not," he said.

"Children Suffer in Silence From Scourge of Asthma"] 
  [Text] The devastating impact of childhood asthma on 
sufferers and their families and the high cost of its treatment 
will be highlighted this week with the release of the largest 
study of its kind into the disease. 
  It reveals that as many children are dying now of asthma as 
they were a decade ago, despite the fact that figures for all 
other causes of childhood deaths have fallen. 
  Half of all admissions of children to hospitals are caused 
by 
asthma, with the cost of childhood asthma to the NHS as much as 
&pound;107 million a year. 
  The Lifestyle Study looked at 773 children with asthma, aged 
between five and 17, and 248 parents. It is the first time the 
impact of asthma has been studied on such a scale. 
  It found 2,482 children died from asthma in 1990, just 0.5 
percent less than in 1980. Over the same time period, deaths 
among children for "all causes" fell by 24 percent. 
  It is thought up to one million children aged between five 
and 14 suffer from wheezing, with diagnosed asthma sufferers 
accounting for one-third to a half of this total. 
  It is still unclear whether the incidence is rising but more 
children are diagnosed with asthma every year. Some experts 
blame increased pollution or maternal smoking. 
  Nick Wells, a pharmaceutical economist and one of the 
authors 
of the report to be published in the European Respiratory 
Review this week, said it was hoped that the findings would 
push the experts into doing something. 
  Mr. Wells and Dr. Warren Lenney, of the Royal Alexander 
Hospital for Sick Children in Brighton, found 38 percent of the 
school children in the study lost an average of 10 days a year 
of education because of their asthma. More than half of the 
parents whose children had more than five days' absence from 
school felt their child's prospects were affected by the 
condition. 
  Large numbers were also unable to take part in sport, play a 
musical instrument or go out with friends. Two-fifths were not 
allowed to take part in some trips or holidays. 
  The effect of asthma on parents is also considerable, 
particularly on mothers. There may be additional housework to 
reduce dust and other irritants and the need to take time off 
work. 
  "The emotional impact on parents can also be considerable," 
the report says. "Feelings of guilt, worry or frustration are 
often experienced." However, what also emerged was a sense of 
"coping" among the parents, with 70 percent developing a routine 
to deal with the illness. 
  The authors suggested NHS costs could be cut if there was 
improved management of the disease in the community rather than 
relying on hospitals. 
  They concluded: "No other paediatric problem has such 
far-reaching consequences. 
  "It appears that both adults and children with asthma often 
suffer in silence and it is only now the full impact of the 
problem is beginning to be understood."

<F P=106> [Article by Birger Hilstrom: "Massive Support for Albania"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Large Danish contributions are on the way for 
rebuilding Albania's health-care system and amount to the most 
extensive export ever of a Danish overall system. Foreign Aid 
Minister Helle Degn has a pool of 45 million kroner [6 million 
dollars] ready and is calling a meeting to decide on 
distribution of the funds. [passage omitted] 
  The 45 million kroner will be provided to the Albanians over 
the next three years, and Degn will invite Danish foreign aid 
organizations and a Danish consulting group, with EU [European 
Union] Parliament member Freddy Blak (Social Democrat) as 
chairman, to a meeting on 31 January to decide how the funds are 
to be distributed. 
  "Until now we have only granted humanitarian aid of between 
2 
and 4 million kroner, but the effort needs to be coordinated and 
targeted correctly," said Degn. "I think we must support the 
weakest, and this means orphaned children and the handicapped, 
and to set up an Albanian legal system." 
  The Albanian Government on Sunday [16 January], asked for 
Danish help in drawing up a comprehensive plan for taking care 
of the mentally handicapped of that poor country. A 
comprehensive plan for psychiatric and mental retardation care 
will be the largest Danish system export ever, amounting to 
hundreds of million [kroner], and the plan will include 
decentralizing from Tirana, training of Albanian personnel, and 
establishing of new housing through [the private] ASF Danish 
Folkehjaelp. 
  The Danish consulting group, which received a request for 
help from the Albanian Ministry of Health following an 
inspection of badly deteriorating hospitals, is gathering funds 
for the project from, among other sources, already appropriated 
EU loans. 
  "We have broad experience in the decentralizing of 
institutions for the develpmentally impaired, and the Albanians 
wanted our model," said former Director of Social Services 
Alfred Dam, who has just returned home from Albania and is in 
the process of drafting a report on the shocking conditions in 
Albanian institutions.

Swine Fever"] 
  [Text] Swine fever has been found on a farm in southern 
Estonia. [Finnish] veterinary authorities consider the disease 
also a threat for Finland. Swine fever is considered as one of 
the most serious animal diseases. If swine fever were to spread 
in Finland, it would mean an immediate halt in the export of 
hogs and pork to countries of the European Union, the United 
States, and Japan. Preventive measures against the disease and 
destruction of infected animals would be of huge cost to the 
pork industry. Swine fever is spread by infected animals from 
which food has been made and by food remnants containing pork. 
Authorities are reminding that meat and meat products may not be 
brought from Estonia because of the danger of spreading the 
disease to Finland. Travelers are limited to bringing a maximum 
of 15 kilograms of canned meat for their own use.

<H5>  MALI </H5>
  AIDS -- Sikasso, one of Mali's most economically well-off 
regions, is also the West African country's most AIDS-stricken 
area with a seropositivity rate of 6 percent compared to the 
national average of 3 percent. Giving the statistics recently, 
Dr. Benoit Karambire said that the high AIDS prevalence was due 
to the area's proximity with Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina 
Faso. According to Dr. Salimata Sissoko, who is in charge of 
Sikasso Hospital's laboratory, about 10 percent of blood donors 
had tested positive with HIV. Dr. Sissoko said Sikasso has 
turned into a place where HIV-infected Malians living in 
neighboring countries come to pass their last days. When the 
infected widows of the exiles return home, they are generally 
inherited by their brothers in law, thus propagating the disease 
to worrying levels among the region's 1.5 million people. [Dakar

already contracted the Human Immune Virus, HIV, necessary for 
the stimulation of AIDS, according to Professor (Eglar), head of 
the Department of Microbiology of Ahmadu Bello University, 
Zaria, at a lecture organized by the Kogi State Medical Students 
Association. Prof. (Eglar) explained that in every one minute, 
two females are infected with the HIV virus, adding that 73 
people died last year from AIDS. He warned against 
indiscriminate promiscuity among adults, saying that prevention 
is the only way of escaping from the disease as the medical 
profession is helpless in finding solutions to its cure. Prof. 
(Eglar) dismissed as false that AIDS originated from Africa, 
adding that the continent's most populous nation, Nigeria, ranks 
among the last in the list of countries noted for the disease. 
The professor called on the Federal Government to set up 
special rehabilitation centers for people infected with AIDS.

<H5>  LESOTHO </H5>
  AIDS -- The superintendent of Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in 
Maseru, Dr. Thabo Masiye, says there are more than 340 HIV AIDS 
victims in the country. Dr. Masiye said the rate of HIV AIDS is 
increasing rapidly and a joint effort is needed to prevent it. 
Dr. Masiye says it is increasing through a lack of knowledge and 
mostly affects the sexually active group, affecting mostly women 
between 19 and 40 years of age. This is an economically active 
group and the economy of the country will decline if they die.

<F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Awal] </F>
  [Text] The menace of AIDS has caught up with all regions in 
the country. The Upper West Region which reported less than 10 
cases of HIV/AIDS in 1990, recorded 47 cases last year and a 
frightening 313 cases as at September, this year. 
  To combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in the region, the regional 
health directorate with the support of the GTZ which has also 
equipped the Wa Hospital laboratory with HIV/AIDS screening 
equipment launched a survey to find out the people's knowledge, 
attitude, beliefs and practices with regard to AIDS. The 
findings of the survey that interviewed 1,100 people comprising 
primary, junior and senior secondary school pupils and students, 
members of youth associations and women's groups, civil servants 
as well as chiefs and elders make interesting reading. 
  Majority of the respondents were aware of AIDS with Wa 
having 
95 percent awareness rate, with 70 percent of the respondents 
saying that behavioural change would minimise greatly the spread 
of AIDS. Regrettably only five percent of these people said they 
were prepared to change their sexual behaviours. Also only 2.4 
percent of the respondents said they were prepared to use 
condoms as a means of preventing the transmission of the HIV 
virus. 
  With the findings of the survey, a regional forum was held 
with representatives of health-related institutions coming 
together to discuss the findings and to adopt effective 
strategies to minimise the spread of the disease. The forum was 
very successful as the participants brainstormed and made useful 
contributions relating to the survey findings. 
  Another forum will be held in December during which the 
results of the survey will serve as a guide for a comprehensive 
information, education and communication (IEC) health plan for 
the region. Though the survey findings are only preliminary, it 
will nonetheless give more impetus to measures and efforts being 
made to combat the spread of HIV and AIDS in the region. 
  Meanwhile, a number of strategies are currently being 
pursued 
to fight the spread of the deadly disease in the region. A 
month-long AIDS awareness campaign has been launched during 
which lectures, symposia, debates and sports activities among 
others will be organised. 
  Launching the campaign, the Deputy Regional Minister, Mr. 
Bede Ziedeng called for concerted efforts to rid the region of 
quack doctors whose activities he said enhances the risk of 
HIV/AIDS infection. He said quack doctors take undue advantage 
of the people's ignorance and use unsterilised and unhygienic 
equipment to administer treatment to patients. 
  The National Council on Women and Development (NCWD) in the 
region has also been organising workshops to educate women's 
groups on AIDS. About 650 leaders of women's groups throughout 
the region have so far benefited from the programme. 
  AIDS counselling centres have also been established at Wa, 
Lawra and Jirapa where 46 AIDS patients are currently receiving 
counselling. The education of prostitutes now referred to as 
"commercial sex workers" on AIDS and other sexually transmitted 
diseases (STD's) is also underway at Wa. 
  It is hoped that the education of prostitutes who constitute 
a major source of HIV transmission would further enhance efforts 
at reducing the spread of the disease. 
  Though the Upper West Region has initiated these encouraging 
measures towards combating the spread of AIDS, yet since AIDS is 
a killer with no known cure, it is in the interest of everybody 
to be careful and abstain from casual sex and irresponsible 
sexual lifestyles.

  [Text] Fourteen people have died at the St Joseph's 
Hospital at Jirapa in the Upper West Region over the past three 
months of a disease suspected to be yellow fever. 
  They were among 37 people admitted to the hospital with the 
disease which had broken out in the Jirapa Lambussie and Nadowli 
districts. 
  Dr. Francis Banka, medical superintendent in charge of the 
hospital, briefed Mr. Joseph Yieleh Chireh, Upper West Regional 
Minister, who visited the hospital at the weekend. 
  Dr. Banka said although the disease had not yet been proved 
to be yellow fever, clinical tests so far carried out indicated 
a high probability that it is the major cause of the deaths. 
  A medical team from Accra in collaboration with personnel 
from the regional directorate of health services was currently 
in the district to establish whether the disease is yellow fever 
or a combination of hepatitis and jaundice, he said. 
  Dr. Banka said the team had been divided into three groups 
to 
carry out the survey in the affected areas and also vaccinate 
and educate the people on preventive measures.

  [Text] Superstition has been identified as the major 
contributory factory to the prevalence of yaws in the Birim 
North District of the Eastern Region. 
  A source close to the New Abirem Health Centre told the 
GRAPHIC that even though c300 is charged for the full treatment 
of the disease, the number of people treated is negligible. 
  As a result, only 460 out of 5,871 cases of yaws detected in 
a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in the 
district have been treated. 
  The source said the superstitious belief of parents that 
injections would paralyse their children and poverty are the 
main causes for the low figure. 
  The district which is among one of the least developed areas 
in the country has the highest number of yaws cases in the 
Eastern Region. 
  It mentioned Mamago, Adauseua, Hhweakwae, Zongo as 
communities where the disease is spreading. 
  The disease is caused by a spirochaete and can be fatal if 
left untreated.

  [Text] Deaths due to malaria infection in the Northern 
Region is now 28.5 percent with children and pregnant mothers 
being the most vulnerable groups. 
  A survey conducted by the Regional Health Administration 
between 1989 and 1993 indicates that 32 percent of ward 
admissions are due to malaria infection while the Out-Patient 
Department (OPD) admissions account for 52.3 percent. 
  This was made known by Dr. Sylvester Anemana, acting 
Regional 
Director of Health Services at the launching of the Regional 
Malaria Control Programme at Tamale yesterday. 
  He said inadequate medical staff is a major constraint in 
the 
control of malaria. 
  He explained that the cash and carry system is also making 
some districts not to sustain regular drug supply while there is 
irrational drug prescription resulting in drug abuse by chemical 
sellers. 
  Dr. Anemana said a regional plan of action to address the 
situation would include in-service training for staff towards 
proper diagnosis and treatment of malaria, provision of 
equipment and raising of the capital base of districts for more 
effective drug supply. 
  Dr. Anemana said public health education is to be 
intensified 
and under a pilot project, impregnated bed-nets are to be used 
as a measure to protect the individual from mosquito bites. If 
it proves successful, it would be extended to other districts. 
  Mr. Gilbert Iddi, Deputy Regional Minister of Agriculture 
who 
was the guest speaker expressed regret that health care delivery 
only reaches about 30 percent of the population in the Northern 
Region. 
  Mr. Baba Ibrahima, Tamale Municipal Secretary, urged the 
health staff to devote time and energy in educating the people 
to adopt preventive measures against malaria attacks.

  [Text] The recent outbreak of cholera at the University of 
Science and Technology (UST) campus, has effectively been 
brought under control. 
  Dr. J.S. Dakora, Director of the University Health Services, 
told me here yesterday, that "the situation is perfectly under 
control and there is no cause for alarm." 
  He said two students who were admitted to the Contagious 
Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Kumasi, following an attack by the 
disease, had been treated and discharged. 
  Dr. Dakora was convinced that the affected students, both 
freshmen who hailed from Accra and Cape Coast and resident at 
the Independence and Unity Halls, might have contracted the 
disease at home. 
  As a routine and part of measures aimed at checking the 
spread of the disease, all the halls of residence had been 
fumigated, he said. 
  Food vendors operating at the campus had also undergone 
medical screening to weed out those with chronic and contagious 
diseases. 
  In addition, factory inspectors had been taxed to ensure 
that 
food vendors operated under proper hygienic conditions.

  [Text] There are reported cases of cholera outbreak in 
three towns in the Central Region. 
  The affected towns are Ekumfi Otuam, Apam, and Komenda. 
  According to Dr. George K. Aggrey, Mfantsiman District 
Medical Officer who led a team of medical personnel to Otuam 
said 23 cases had been reported at the Otuam Health Post. 
  He said out of the number, 20 patients were treated and 
discharged while three are on admission. 
  He attributed the disease to shortage of water in the area. 
  Dr. Charles Ntiamoah Takyi, the senior medical officer in 
charge of Apam Catholic Mission Hospital, attributed the 
outbreak to the acute water shortage which has hit the Apam area 
for more than six months now. 
  According to Dr. Takyi, about 20 students were treated from 
Apam Secondary School alone with diarrhoea for the past two 
weeks. 
  Dr. Takyi advised the people to stop buying water from 
petrol 
and oil tankers. 
  He alleged that some of the petrol and oil tankers are not 
well washed before they are filled with water for consumption. 
  Commenting on the issue, Dr. Elias Sory, Central Regional 
Director of Health Services said an outbreak of cholera has also 
been reported in the Komenda area. 
  He said apart from enough stock of drugs for the treatment 
of 
the disease, mobile vans have also been despatched to the 
affected areas to educate the people on its prevention. 
  The director appealed to the people to ensure that their 
environments are kept tidy at all times.

<F P=106> [Article by I.K. MacArthur] </F>
  [Text] The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) is 
currently breeding a large number of tsetseflies for a 
biological control programme to check tsetsefly infestation in 
the country. 
  The commission, at the moment, has more than 10,000 adult 
females, a number of males and over 23,000 pupae in its 
laboratories which are being used to reproduce males for the 
project. 
  Dr. (Mrs.) Delphina Aba Ababie-Gomez, Head of the Department 
of Animal Sciences at the GAEC, who made this known to the 
GRAPHIC explained that under the programme, an irradiation 
facility -- a Cobalt 60 Gamma source -- which is being installed 
at the commission will be used to sterilise the insects, 
particularly the males. 
  Sufficient numbers of the sterile males, she said, will then 
be released in critically infested areas to overwhelm the 
population of the insects in the wild. 
  When the females in the wild mate with the sterile males, no 
offsprings will be produced, resulting in reduction in the 
tsetsefly population. 
  The biological control programme, the sterile insect 
technology is being undertaken by the commission in 
collaboration with the Veterinary Services Division of the 
Ministry of Food and Agriculture at Pong Tamale and the Animal 
Research Institute of the Scientific and Industrial Research 
(CSIR). 
  It is being supported by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency based in Vienna, Austria. 
  Dr. Adabie-Gomez said when the tsetsefly population is 
reduced, it will lead to a reduction in the incidence of 
trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which affects 
man and animals in the country. 
  She further explained that a reduction in the population of 
the insect in critically infested areas would enable the country 
to reclaim the land for human settlement, agriculture and other 
socio-economic purposes. 
  She disclosed that some lands in the oncho-free areas of the 
Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions are not being fully 
utilised at the moment because of tsetsefly infestation. 
  Parts of Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern and Volta 
regions are also endemic, she added. 
  Dr. Adabie-Gomez hinted that a limited number of sterile 
females will be released for dynamic population studies in 
three sites in the White Volta and Nabogo River basins of the 
Northern Region from April to July next year. The releases will 
be done monthly. 
  The release of the sterile adult males, she said, will begin 
around August next year during the rainy season in the Northern 
Region.

  [Excerpt] Eleven people have died in the past one week 
following an outbreak of meningitis in Kocholwa Location, 
Southern Division of Elgeyo Marakwet District. 
  Confirming the outbreak of the disease yesterday, the Elgeyo 
Marakwet Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Koech, said three 
people died in Kapkosom sub-Location, five in Molol sub-Location 
and three at Kocholwa. 
  Dr. Koech said two people were admitted at Plateau Mission 
Hospital in Uasin Gishu District. He appealed for calm among 
wananchi because the disease was under control. 
  Dr. Koech said a team of medical personnel from Iten 
District 
Hospital had been sent to immunise the people in the area and 
urged wananchi to go for immunisation at Kocholwa Trading 
Centre. The immunisation exercise will take four days. 
  The outbreak of meningitis was last reported in Kisii in 
early October last year when it killed four people from one 
family at Riangoncho village. Several other people including 
school children were admitted to hospital for treatment. 
  Earlier in September, three school children were reported to 
have died following an outbreak of meningitis in Soi, Elgeyo 
Marakwet District. Six other children were admitted to Plateau 
Mission Hospital for treatment. 
  At the time, Dr. Koech said the children who died from the 
disease were aged between three and nine and that he had toured 
the area and made sure that public health officers took 
preventive measures. 
  A vaccination campaign was carried out and Dr. Koech said 
public health experts would keep the situation under constant 
surveillance to curb further spread of the disease. 
  Earlier last year, a massive yellow fever vaccination drive 
was conducted in the area and neighbouring Baringo where more 
than 500,000 people were given the jabs.

<F P=106> [Article by Pamphil Kweyuh and Alex Diang'a: "Kenya May Soon </F>
Conquer Leprosy"] 
  [Excerpt] Kenya is well advanced in the World Health 
Organisation-initiated efforts to conquer leprosy by the year 
2000, researchers have learned. 
  Dr. Daniel Kibuga, head of the National Tuberculosis and 
Leprosy Control Programme (NLTP), says numbers of new cases 
registered yearly for treatment have dropped remarkably from 
10,000 to 700 patients between 1985 and 1992. A further drop to 
400 is expected in the next five years. 
  By Kibuga's prediction, Kenya may be among the first of some 
94 countries where four to six people in every 10,000 suffer 
from leprosy to come down to the WHO target of one in every 
10,000 by the year 2000. WHO considers the current rate 
"endemic." 
  In Kenya, leprosy is endemic in Western, Eastern and Coast 
provinces. Researchers say the disease is largely caused by 
overcrowding and poverty, a factor that makes it difficult to 
understand why it has not been reported in the North Eastern 
Province. 
  Isolated cases of leprosy have been recorded in Kenya's 
other 
provinces, Central, Rift Valley and Nairobi, says Kibuga, adding 
that the disease is caused by a bacteria clinically known as 
Mycobacteria lepraer. 
  According to Dr. Patrick Orega, the head of Alupe Leprosy 
and 
Skin Disease Research Centre of the Kenya Medical Research 
Institute (KEMRI), the last epidemiology survey conducted in 
Kenya in 1988 found four in every 10,000 people to be afflicted. 
  Of these 97 percent were recorded in Western and Nyanza 
provinces. Kenya, with some six million people suffering from 
leprosy, is one of the countries targeted in the global WHO 
strategy to combat the disease. 
  Alupe, on the edge of the Angoromo Shopping Centre, 500 kms 
west of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, maintained a record of 
4,000 patients on treatment countrywide, although Orege believes 
that there are 30,000 people suffering from leprosy in Kenya.

  [Excerpt] Fifty-five people have died of measles in Chama 
in Eastern Province since the outbreak of the disease in January. 
  Provincial medical officer Dr. Godfrey Chishimba said 978 
cases of measles had been recorded and the death toll could be 
higher because some occurred in remote areas without the 
knowledge of health personnel. 
  Dr. Chishimba said most of the deaths occurred between 
January and September in nine places under chiefs Kambombo, 
Tembwe, Chibale, Mulilo and Chikwa. 
  A team of medical staff had been sent to the affected areas 
to immunise people against the killer disease and that another 
group will soon go there to carry out another round of 
immunisation. 
  Dr. Chishimba who complained of erratic supply of drugs to 
the province to contain the disease said the situation was under 
control. 
  But reports reaching Chipata from Chama say there is a fresh 
outbreak of the disease and more people are dying especially in 
Chief Kambombo's area.

  One of the inmates who claimed he had been denied a chance 
to 
go to Kitwe Central Hospital for treatment said a number of his 
colleagues had been attacked by the disease. 
  Another inmate, Rabson Lupandulo, said the outbreak was a

  Congestion in the cells had contributed to the epidemic 
which 
has ravaged the prison for almost two weeks.

  [Text] The National AIDS Co-ordination Programme (NACP) has 
reported 1,794 new AIDS cases recorded between July and 
September this year, bringing the cumulative total of official 
figures to 25,332. 
  The latest number of cases was announced by the Deputy 
Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Cde. Tsingirirai Hungwe, 
at the launching ceremony of a book on workplace-based 
initiatives on combating AIDS in Harare on Monday. 
  Cde. Hungwe, however, said because of the extensive 
under-reporting, the NACP estimated that the real total was 
likely to be three times higher, that is, about 70,000 cases. 
  "But AIDS is the only terminal stage of HIV infection, and 
it 
is the number of new infections that is of most concern. 
Surveillance of ante-natal mothers at a number of clinics around 
the country indicates a continuing rise in new infections," she 
said. 
  Cde. Hungwe said at several sites, infection levels of more 
than 30 percent had been recorded. More than a third of the 
women tested had HIV infection and would almost certainly 
progress to AIDS within a few years. In Zimbabwe the incubation 
period was estimated at about seven years. 
  "For every woman reported with HIV, there is likely to be an 
infected man. Total AIDS cases in men are slightly higher than 
reported cases in women, which may reflect a bias of more men 
gaining access to medical treatment and testing," she said. 
  What made HIV infection and AIDS critical concerns, apart 
from the numbers of cases and the rate of increase, was the age 
range of those infected and dying. The majority occurred in 
adults of working age. 
  The AIDS epidemic had resulted in demoralisation as 
colleagues and workmates became sick and die. Coupled to that 
was absenteeism as workers took time off to attend funerals or 
nurse sick relatives. 
  "In the long run, productivity will suffer and companies 
will 
experience increasing difficulty in coping with labour shortage 
and turnover," she said. 
  The World Health Organisation estimated that there were 
around 13 million HIV infections in adults by mid-1993 and about 
one million babies had contracted the virus, many of whom had 
already died.

  [Text] Masvingo's Gutu District, which has become notorious 
for its unusually high incidences of STD, has slashed its levels 
of infection by 1,000 cases every year, a health officer has 
said. 
  The district nursing officer, Sister Winnie Fadzai 
Mavedzenge, last week said incidences of sexually transmitted 
diseases among schoolchildren, which recently represented about 
60 percent of recorded cases, had been "reduced tremendously." 
  She attributed the reduction to a vigorous anti-AIDS 
awareness campaign which sparked off a "condom riot" at 
Gutu-Mupandawana growth point as people dropped unprotected sex. 
  "People are coming on their own to collect condoms which we 
have flooded in all night spots at the growth point," she said. 
Cde. Mavedzenge said STD had tumbled down to fourth on the list 
of problem diseases in Gutu after acute respiratory infections, 
injuries, and skin diseases since the launch in 1990. 
  The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare went on the 
offensive following reports of mounting STD and HIV cases in the 
district of nearly 200,000 people. 
  Under a recently unveiled knowledge, attitudes and practices 
programme, public health officers studied socio-economic 
profiles of vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren housed in 
illegal boarding camps before prescribing durable solutions. 
  "We told the heads of schools that all pupils not housed in 
proper boarding places had to go back to their villages where 
they fall under their parents' authority," she said. 
  In 1989, Gutu was shocked when the then district medical 
officer, Dr. David Blankhart, said that at least 100 patients in 
Gutu Mission Hospital had tested HIV positive. 
  Although his statistics were holy disputed, the spiral of 
infection continued to rise sharply as no fewer than 2,000 STD 
cases were recorded per year in the district between 1991 and 
1993. 
  Sister Mavedzenge, however, said since the launch of the 
campaign, numbers of "ladies of easy virtue" had dwindled 
considerably at Gutu-Mupandawana owing largely to a rapidly 
disappearing clientele.

  [Text] A programme to immunise children against measles is 
now underway in both Matabeleland North and South following an 
outbreak of the disease in several districts, health officials 
reported yesterday. 
  Officials at the provincial medical directorate in Bulawayo 
said three children had died as a result of the disease since 
the first cases of measles were recorded in July. Of the three, 
two were from Tshelanyemba area in Matobo and the other was from 
Matabeleland North. 
  "We are now carrying out mass immunisation of children at 
risk of catching the disease especially in the most affected 
areas of Filabusi, Gwanda, Kezi and Matobo. In Matabeleland 
North, the programme centres on such areas as Nkayi, Lupane and 
Tsholotsho," they said. 
  However, the officials said the number of measles cases 
recorded over the past two months indicated that there was a 
slight decrease. The peak months were September and August. The 
officials said this was normal at the time of the year but they 
did not know the reasons for this. 
  According to officers, while all children were vaccinated 
against measles at an early stage, the protection against the 
disease tended to be limited as they grew older. As a result, 
the most affected were those above the age of five, they said. 
  In Bulawayo more than 1,000 cases of the disease were 
recorded but officials said the epidemic was under control. No 
figures of deaths were given. 

  -  A total of 22 cases of measles were recorded in Gweru last 
month. According to the city health department's monthly 
reports, cases of measles have been increasing steadily since 
July, when the first case was diagnosed. 
  The city health department had since July recorded 50 cases 
of the disease and some of the cases were from outside Gweru. 
The report said most of the cases recorded were mild and 
therefore did not require hospitalisation. The city health 
department in the report urged residents to ensure that their 
children were immunised against the disease. It said although 
the vaccination was not able to completely eradicate measles, it 
reduced the mortality and severity of the disease.

  [Excerpt] A severe outbreak of Newcastle, a most dangerous 
contagious poultry disease capable of eradicating entire flocks 
within days, has been reported in Masvingo's Sengwe and Matibi 
districts. The outbreak is a potential threat to the 
multi-million-dollar poultry and ostrich export trade, if left 
uncontrolled. 
  The Department of Veterinary Services has mounted roadblocks 
on all roads out of Sengwe and Matibi Two and vehicles are being 
searched to ensure they are not carrying chickens, chicken meat, 
eggs or chicken cages. 
  Dr. Stuart Hargreaves, the director of veterinary services, 
said in an interview yesterday that the outbreak, the first in 
eight years, was reported on Christmas Eve and roadblocks were 
mounted immediately. 
  A veterinary team, comprising 50 vaccinators, had been 
deployed and had so far vaccinated over 70,000 chickens in the 
communal areas. 
  The exercise is expected to be completed this week in the 
most affected areas and could last for a month in the 
surrounding areas, where surveillance had been intensified. 
  The outbreak is still confined to the estimated 200,000 
village birds in the two districts which are very far from 
commercial poultry production areas. Zimbabwe has an estimated 
population of between 15 and 30 million village birds. 
  The disease is believed to have spread from South Africa, 
which had reported large numbers of outbreaks recently. People 
crossing into Zimbabwe, from Vendaland, which is adjacent to 
Sengwe, could have brought chickens affected with the disease. 
  South Africa's Newcastle outbreak covered most of the 
Transvaal in December last year, and later moved into parts of 
the Orange Free State and Northern Natal, with some mortalities 
in some incorrectly vaccinated flocks as high as 30 percent. 
  Large-scale poultry producers, due to these developments in 
South Africa, had since formulated an effective monitoring 
programme for day-old chick producers to enable them, if 
necessary, to accurately assess the disease status of their 
flocks and prevent the spread.

  [Summary] In May, a cholera outbreak inflicting more than 
100 people in Keping County of Xinjiang Province was reported. A 
new serotype Vibrio cholerae strain 0[.sup]139[/] was 
identified to be the cause of the outbreak. Because up to 7 
July, all 106 cases including two deaths were identified to be 
non-01 Vibrio cholerae infections, and were all adults. 
Professor Gao Shouyu [7559 1343 0001] at the Institute of 
Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine 
pointed out that 0[.sup]139[/] is a highly virulent serotype 
strain, and it is still unknown whether it came from the two 
close neighboring countries, India and Bangladesh, which had 
just reported the outbreaks not long ago. Professor Gao said 
that since nobody in China has the kind of antibody to fight 
against the new strain, if an outbreak should occur, it would be 
an uncontrollable one.

  [Summary] It was reported that diarrhea epidemic caused by 
newly discovered 0-1 type Vibrio cholerae has been rampant in 
China's neighboring southeast Asia countries with a mortality 
rate of five percent. Experts at the Consultation Committee of 
the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) warned that although cholera 
and typhoid situations in China have stabilized somewhat in 
recent two years, yet poor sanitary conditions, low living 
standards, and floating population in South China may trigger 
outbreaks in that area. MPH urges all concerned epidemic disease 
prevention departments to closely monitor trends of the 
epidemic, and implement quarantine on floating population.

  [Summary] According to reports of the Ministry of Public 
Health's random survey on tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology, 
tuberculosis situation in China is still very serious. The 
survey showed that estimates of Chinese population with active 
TB is 523 per 100,000, and population with positive TB is 134 
per 100,000. Estimates of patients contracting active TB and 
positive TB are around 5.39 million and 1.51 million 
respectively, despite recent decreases of 2.8 percent and 3.0 
percent of patients with active TB and positive TB. Experts 
believe that the above decreasing rates are still too low 
compared with that of other diseases. Although large cities such 
as Beijing and Shanghai have shown sharp decreases at an annual 
rate of 19.2 percent and 15.7 percent respectively, active TB 
and positive TB cases in autonomous regions and the rural areas 
such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Guizhou, and Xinjiang have 
increased approximately 2.4 times and 2.8 times that of large 
cities.

  [Text] Burma is on the brink of an AIDS [Acquired Immuno 
Deficiency Syndrome] explosion that could rival the problems 
experienced in neighboring India and Thailand. New studies 
revealed that Burma has the world's highest prevalence of the 
AIDS-producing HIV virus among intravenous drug users, and one 
estimate says 400,000 people may already have been infected. 
Evan Williams reports that after years of disastrous economic 
isolation, Rangoon's dilapidated health structure appears unable 
to cope with Asia's unknown AIDS epidemic. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Unidentified speaker: He was having fever for 
over a month here, he had thrush all over his month, he had 
these shingles, he had lymphatic glands, and marks all over his 
body. He was very very ill, and in fact I thought he was not 
going to make it. That was a few years ago. 
  Williams: Twenty-four-year-old Myo Tun used to 
share needles with friends to inject heroin for a dollar a hit. 
Now he lies in Rangoon's Infectious Diseases Hospital -- part 
of the first wave of an epidemic nobody really knows the size of. 
  Unidentified speaker: When he started using this 
among his friends nobody, you know, cleans the needle. 
  Williams: In fact, nobody knew about AIDS, and 
few in Burma really still understand it. The biggest problem in 
the country producing most of the world's heroin is among 
injecting drug users. Many are sexually active young men who 
work in mining areas and travel throughout the country. It's 
illegal to possess a needle in Burma so instead those using 
heroin go to so-called shooting galleries where more than a 
dozen people share one needle. A new study says Burma has the 
world's highest rate of HIV infection among injecting drug 
users. It is a third more than New York and 15 times more than 
Sydney. It says HIV infection among these drug users in Burma 
is out of control, and there are no signs of that changing. In 
some areas, 96 percent of prisoners and drug users tested were 
HIV positive. AIDS is established in the Burmese population, it 
says, and a lack of information is spreading it fast. 
  Unidentified speaker: What is needed now is, 
really, a nationwide information campaign which has to reach all 
the population as fast as possible. 
  Williams: UNICEF's Sylvia Muchiani says Burma's 
AIDS problem could already compare with the worst in Asia where 
hundreds of thousands are HIV positive. 
  Muchiani: There are estimates that the HIV 
positive cases could be anywhere between 100,000 and 400,000. 
  Williams: So do you think Burma is actually one 
of the biggest HIV problem countries perhaps in the region? 
  Muchiani: After Thailand and India at the moment, 
and with the knowledge we have, Burma is the third worst country 
in the region. 
  Williams: HIV positive prostitutes returning from 
Thailand, casual sex workers moving through the country, and a 
health system sharing needles for family patients have spread 
HIV into the wider community. Condoms are available but in 
short supply and are rarely used. 
  Muchiani: Now the epidemic is not restricted 
anymore to intravenous drug users. It has grown and is 
spreading very rapidly among the heterosexual population. A lot 
has to do with intraborder movement, migration... 
  Williams: International AIDS groups are just 
starting to discover the scale of the problem here, but 
education will be difficult in a conservative society that does 
not openly discuss sex and a country run by a military junta 
lacking international support. [end recording]

  [Text] [Excerpts] Startling new HIV statistics discovered 
last month have prompted the director of the Phnom Penh Pasteur 
Institute to call for a massive nationwide AIDS education 
campaign. 
  The number of HIV positive cases diagnosed in Cambodia last 
month nearly tripled the previous month with the victims tending 
to be male and with an average age of 26. 
  Dr. Kruy Sunlay's Pasteur Institute found nearly 8 percent 
of 
patients seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases 
(STD) at the institute in September tested positive for HIV, 
while about 2 percent of blood donors at the National Blood 
Transfusion Center have been testing positive every month since 
January of this year -- 85 percent of donors are males aged 18 
to 40. 
  In total, 132 Cambodians were tested positive for HIV in 
September -- more than one a day. In the eight months from 
January until the end of August, a total of 82 people were found 
to be HIV positive. To date more than 200 people have tested 
HIV positive in Cambodia, but Health Ministry officials say WHO 
estimates put the real figure at between 1,000 to 2,000. 
  "I think this is the second killing fields in Cambodia, but 
it will be in another ten years," Dr. Kruy said grimly referring 
to the time it would take victims to develop full blown AIDS. 
  "The problem now is we have no funds for HIV testing," she 
added. 
  Last months' victims ranged in age from 18 to 32. The 20 STD 
patients included two women -- 18 and 20 years old, while most 
of the men were in their twenties. 
  "I think the Ministry of Health realizes how big the problem 
is, but they don't have any funds," Dr. Kruy said. 
  "The important problem is not only diagnosis in the 
laboratory but health education on TV, radio, and in newspapers." 
  "There's not enough information given to the population, 
they 
need more," she said. 
  "I hope the new government will do something about this 
problem. I think it's outside my responsibility, but I know 
they have no funds." 
  Dr. Kruy called for an AIDS education program to be 
introduced into high schools and universities around the country. 
  "After peace has come, I heard the object of the government 
is developing the country, the economics sector, but the most 
important thing is that the country has good health. For 
example, with AIDS we might have in ten years we wouldn't be 
able to develop the country." 
  Mr. Lars Meyner, head of the national blood transfusion 
program of the International Committee of the Red Cross echoed 
Dr. Kruy's call for more education and claimed popular ignorance 
could see Cambodia slide into a situation like Thailand where 
AIDS is reaching epidemic proportions. 
  "Many young men here as we know have the first sexual 
experience with a commercial sex worker and because of this it 
is a big risk as serious or probably even more serious than in 
Thailand," Mr. Meyner said. 
  "In Thailand the prostitutes are using condoms, here they 
don't have that awareness. If you asked the majority of the 
male population in Thailand they know what a condom is, here 
they don't." 
  With HIV on the increase Mr. Meyner is concerned about the 
possibility of infected blood being used in transfusions. 
  "Of course our first objective here is to give safe blood to 
the patients, with a high number of HIV positives we can never 
guarantee HIV free blood -- there is a window period of two to 
three months from when a patient contracts the disease to when 
it shows up in the antibody blood test." 
  Mr. Meyner added that HIV would easily spread in this 
country 
through needle sharing -- a practice of many small provincial 
hospitals and pharmacies. 
  "If you go to the local pharmacy at the market and he gives 
you an injection he uses the same needle for very many people 
and that's one way it's spreading here," he said. 
  "I think maybe there is still no real understanding among 
the 
general population of exactly what AIDS is and what the 
consequences are if you get AIDS, it seems like the message has 
not gone out." 
  The first HIV positive case was diagnosed in Cambodia in 
June 
1991, such tests were not previously available here so it's 
impossible to tell when the first Cambodian contracted the 
disease. Several patients are already showing signs of AIDS 
related complaints. 
  [passage omitted] She adds that the lack of visible symptoms 
in HIV positive patients contributes to the population's 
ignorance and refusal to acknowledge HIV is a problem in 
Cambodia. 
  Most of Cambodia's victims are young men and many of them 
married, but few wives continue to stay with their husbands 
after hearing they are HIV positive. Most of Cambodia's HIV 
cases are believed to have been transmitted through heterosexual 
sex. 
  It seems culturally acceptable for Cambodian men to visit 
brothels and locals estimate up to 95 percent of Cambodian males 
would visit a prostitute at least once in their life time. 
  Dr. Kruy is not alone in her fear of an AIDS epidemic 
gripping Cambodia. The World Health Organization and several 
foreign non-government organizations have recognized the problem 
and started to take steps to combat it. 
  Although more than 100 Cambodian HIV victims had been 
identified in 1991 and 1992, none of them were informed of their 
status as no counseling service was available, until February of 
this year. The decision not to inform victims before this time 
was made jointly by WHO and the then Phnom Penh government. 
  But earlier this year ten Cambodians were trained to do 
pre-test and post- test counseling and HIV victims began to be 
informed of their disease. 
  "There are only a few cases in the provinces. If we can stop 
the spread in Phnom Penh, we won't have a problem like 
Thailand," Dr. Kruy said. 
  Dr. Mam Bun Heng, chairman of the National AIDS Committee, 
said the new government had put AIDS control on the high 
priority list, but funds and real commitment from the community 
were lacking. 
  "We are trying now to get more money. We have produced a 
five-year comprehensive plan, but we need money -- $7.5 
million," he said. 
  "And we need a commitment from all sectors, education, 
administration, religion, and the economic sector... not only to 
talk but to develop the program." 
  He said the first plan of the program was to educate high 
risk groups like prostitutes and STD victims. 
  "The problem is information and education and how to spread 
it to the public," Dr. Mam Bun Heng said.

  [Text] Six months ago Dr. Ouk Vong-vathiny's office was a 
notorious brothel in the Tuol Kork strip, today it's a free 
medical center for the local population. 
  The Tuol Kork community dike clinic opened its doors to the 
public in June of this year and is a joint project between Phnom 
Penh, the World Health Organization and British Volunteer 
Service Overseas. It is the first step in an attempt to monitor 
and research the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV 
among prostitutes and their clients. 
  Although the clinic cannot do HIV tests, Dr. Ouk is 
qualified 
to do pretest counseling and refer patients to the Pasteur 
Institute for testing. She has already nine patients inquire 
about HIV tests, but after pre-test counseling, only four of 
them decided to go through with the test. 
  "Many are afraid to know the result, because they think they 
will have to change their lifestyle," Dr. Ouk says. 
  "I say that it is good for them to know that they are HIV 
positive because then they can look after themselves, have good 
eating habits, good work, good hygiene of the body, good 
exercise, and not have sex any more without condoms. 
  "I tell them they will need some people to support them when 
they get AIDS and if there is ever some drug, they will know 
very soon and can cure themselves." 
  Last month, Dr. Ouk and her male colleague saw 193 patients 
(more than 25 percent of them commercial sex workers) and 
treated 102 sexually transmitted diseases. 
  The examination room is sparsely furnished with a sink, 
table, a few chairs and an examination bench. A worn microscope 
rests on a bench near the window from where one gets a view of 
the marshy dike and thatch-roofed local houses. 
  "They come here because they are afraid of HIV, because they 
sometimes tear their condom and because they didn't know about 
HIV, so they didn't use condoms ... they don't give them 
education about HIV, they look so sad," she said. 
  "Our biggest problem is gonorrhea, but I can't tell you 
about 
HIV or syphilis because we don't do the blood tests here, only 
refer them." 
  Dr. Ouk claims ignorance is the biggest barrier to 
combatting 
AIDS in Cambodia. She tells a story of a man who is believed to 
be peddling a bogus inoculation against AIDS and STD in the Tuol 
Kork brothel strip. She has heard it's 10,000 riel a shot and 
would-be buyers are told they must have one every month. 
  Even the brothel owners tell me, "we never saw AIDS here, 
what does AIDS mean?" she says. 
  They don't understand HIV because they can't see any 
symptoms, she adds. 
  About 1,000 prostitues work from wooden shacks along the 
Tuol 
Kork strip, many of them are ethnic Vietnamese, but the 
Cambodians are well represented as are half Khmer-Vietnamese. 
  "Before the election many went back to Vietnam, but after 
that they came back with many of their relatives," she said. 
  "The youngest I met was 14, but most are 16 years old." 
  "They are usually from poor families, sometimes they have a 
broken heart, sometimes their family sells them." 
  She says it is usually the mother who brings the girl in for 
sale and a lot end up paying off their parents' gambling debts. 
  "They think if they are rich and they have enough money they 
will go back and married to a good man. If they have gold and 
good clothes it will be easy to find a man to marry when they go 
back." 
  If a prostitute gets pregnant, her brothel usually arranges 
an abortion for her. 
  A girl fetches her highest price for her virginity. 
According to Dr. Ouk, it's an Asian belief that oral sex with a 
virgin will improve the health of old men and increase 
longevity, and the new rich Khmers are joining visiting Hong 
Kong and Singaporean businessmen in bidding for young girls -- 
the going rate is $800 a week which is split between the girl's 
family and the broker who procures the virgin. The customers 
are always over 40 years old, Dr. Ouk says. Local Cambodian men 
claim virgins can be bought for $300 to $400 if you know how to 
cut out the middle man. 
  Dr. Ouk says a girl will usually spend a week with the man 
who buys her virginity and after that will start to earn around 
$100 a time for the next month as she's still "fresh". 
Subsequent months she will earn around $20 a time if she stays 
in a dancing hall, but most of the girls in Tuol Kork earn 
between $2 and $4 a customer. 
  The one-time fee decreases with time and wear and tear. 
  "The average number of clients for the girl per day is five 
to six, but some of them get ten every day -- she is the pretty 
girl," Dr. Ouk says. "The pretty girl can get a high price and 
many clients." 
  One afternoon a week, brothel owners and prostitutes are 
invited for health education sessions at the clinic, but to date 
attendances are low. 
  Dr. Ouk is concerned that HIV will quickly spread throughout 
the whole country as the prostitutes are a transient population 
and usually come in from the provinces to work in the city for a 
year before returning to their home district. 
  She believes 95 percent of Cambodian males visit a brothel 
at 
least once in their lives. It is an acceptable part of 
Cambodian culture. Last week she treated a 16 year-old boy for 
gonorrhea. 
  The Tuol Kork community dike clinic is open four mornings a 
week from 0800 to 1100.

  [Text] Twenty-one peacekeepers serving with the United 
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia lost their lives in 
Cambodia as a result of hostile action, 17 were killed in 
traffic accidents, five died from malaria, four of heart 
attacks, 20 others from accidents or other illnesses, but up to 
150 will probably die of AIDS. 
  Forty-seven United Nations military and civilian personnel 
were diagnosed HIV positive in Cambodia, but UNTAC's chief 
medical officer Colonel Dr. Peter Fraps claims the real number 
of HIV cases contracted in Cambodia could run as high as 150. 
  "I know that there are some nations where each soldier 
repatriated is tested and I know that they find a lot of 
positive cases," Dr. Fraps said. 
  "I know that there are contingents that had up to now five 
or 
eight cases of HIV in-country, and I heard in the meantime they 
found an additional ten cases when they tested the soldiers at 
home." 
  "I think the figure will be much higher than the 47 we found 
here. I can just guess and I would say up to 150. But this is 
just a rough idea." 
  When the number of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) being 
diagnosed among United Nations personnel began to skyrocket 
towards the end of last year, finally peaking at 666 for the 
month of December, Dr. Fraps decided something had to be done. 
An AIDS awareness campaign was launched involving videos and 
booklets, more than a quarter of a million condoms were 
distributed to UNTAC personnel and compulsory HIV testing on all 
patients suffering from a sexually transmitted disease was 
introduced. 
  "We had people come five, six or seven times with a sexually 
transmitted disease," Dr. Fraps said. 
  The German medics then began an AIDS education campaign 
among 
prostitutes and the local population as part of their civic 
action program, but when they offered free HIV tests the World 
Health Organizsation stepped in and asked for it to end as there 
were no trained AIDS counselors in Cambodia and it was regarded 
irresponsible to tell people they had a life-threatening disease 
if you could not provide adequate counseling. Dr. Fraps agreed 
and the testing was stopped. In February this year counselors 
were trained and now local HIV victims are told of their 
condition. 
  He also issued a directive in September last year that all 
patients with serious injuries undergo HIV tests as a measure of 
protection for the German doctors performing surgeries. 
  "You can say we did everything, but you cannot change the 
mentality and this is the problem," he said. 
  "When we had the first cases of HIV in September/October 
1992, I asked headquarters in New York -- the medical director 
-- what the U.N.'s policy is. I asked specifically what to do 
with HIV positives here in the mission area and I did it twice 
and I never received an answer, therefore I pursued the policy 
of many armies: That a soldier who is found positive will not 
be dismissed, although he can be dismissed if he asks for it -- 
that's the policy in the German army." 
  "As long as he is HIV positive and has no symptoms -- no 
pain 
-- he will stay in the army." 
  Although Dr. Fraps admits he really wanted all HIV positive 
UNTAC personnel repatriate for the safety of their colleagues 
who might unwittingly administer first aid to them in an 
emergency situation and contract the disease themselves, no HIV 
positive UNTAC employee was repatriated before their time. 
  Dr. Fraps said former Eastern bloc countries figured high on 
the sexually transmitted disease file and blamed this partly on 
ignorance and the new-found freedom of soldiers from these 
countries. 
  While the number of UNTAC employees reporting in with STD 
was always high, Dr. Fraps believes still more cases went 
unreported because the victims were afraid of being repatriated, 
or as in the case of one contingent STD, statistics for its 
soldiers were altered before any reports were sent to the Phnom 
Penh headquarters. 
  "The opinion was, because I was talking with someone from 
this contingent, that it shouldn't be interesting for 
headquarters how many cases of sexually transmitted diseases 
they had and it's absolutely not necessary to talk with them 
about HIV." 
  Dr. Fraps added that other countries like Bangladesh, India, 
and Pakistan seemed to have a "national policy" of reporting a 
much lower STD rate than they actually had. 
  "And you have no means as chief medical officer to make 
pressure, it's impossible," he said. 
  "I think there should be an open handling of these things 
because everybody is concerned it's a worldwide problem, and 
therefore to hide cases is absolutely stupid and it's dangerous." 
  "For many of the soldiers here it was an event that was to 
be 
seen under monetary viewpoints. They earned a lot of money for 
staying here one year, or six months, or eighteen months. Each 
of the soldiers got more money for staying here than in his home 
country. 
  "Most of these soldiers were coming from third-world 
countries, some of them were earning ten times more than in 
their home countries, therefore the policy of each soldier was 
to stay as long as possible in this mission area. And if you 
know that commanders in some nations said "If you are treated 
for a sexually transmitted disease you will be sent home", then 
you can imagine what happended. Many cases didn't see the 
doctor, just to avoid the situation that they would be sent 
home, because this was the promise of the commander," Dr. Fraps 
explained. 
  More than 5,000 treatments were provided to UNTAC personnel 
suffering from STD during this mission. But Dr. Fraps estimates 
another 1,500 cases went unreported. 
  About 3,000 HIV tests were conducted on UN personnel while 
serving in Cambodia. 
  Dr. Fraps readily admits UNTAC personnel have probably 
helped 
spread the HIV virus in Cambodia, but he is adamant that UNTAC 
is not responsible for the HIV virus in Cambodia and he is 
backed up by other health experts in Phnom Penh. 
  "We have soldiers in the mission area from countries where 
HIV is epidemic therefore it's absolutely likely that soldiers 
coming from these countries contributed to the contamination in 
the area. Also we had a lot of personnel going to Thailand on 
holiday, and it's also possible there was contamination caused 
by sexual intercourse with Thai prostitutes." 
  "But it is absolutely not true that Cambodia before this 
mission had no problems with HIV or they had no problems 
concerning sexually transmitted diseases." 
  "It's not fair to say that due to this UNTAC mission the 
first contamination came to Cambodia." 
  Following Dr. Fraps education campaign efforts and the end 
of the UNTAC mission, the number of reported cases of sexually 
transmitted diseases among UN personnel is on the decline. In 
July 284 cases were reported, in August it was down to 177. The 
average age of HIV victims in UNTAC is 25. 
  Dr. Fraps would like to see the United Nations implement 
compulsory HIV testing for all soldiers going on future 
missions. He said all nations should have a mission preparation 
course that discusses how to avoid contracting STD and HIV. He 
also thinks UN headquarters should require all countries to 
report all HIV cases believed to have been contracted in 
Cambodia, including those found on repatriation, to aid policy 
planning for future missions.

  [Text] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The estimates of how 
many people are stricken by malaria each year vary by the tens 
of thousands. 
  After the disruptions of the 1970's, diagnoses of the 
disease 
by microscope resumed in the late 1980's with the provision of 
equipment and laboratory training by foreign relief agencies. 
Now, about 120,000 cases are confirmed microscopically each 
year; nonetheless, they don't really indicate the incidence of 
malaria because so many people are treated without blood tests. 
  The Ministry of Health has estimated that as many as 500,000 
Cambodians may contract malaria each year, resulting in between 
5,000 and 10,000 deaths. In contrast, Thailand, with a 
population almost nine times larger, registers only about 
300,000 cases annually and about 3,000 deaths. 
  Cambodia has a National Malaria Center, but administrative 
activities are decentralized, with provincial and district 
health committees determining how best to combat the disease. 
They have yielded some data on the effectiveness of 
anti-malarial drugs. 
  In northwestern parts of the country, the resistance of the 
most deadly malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to 
traditional remedies is progressing at an alarming rate. 
Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyremethamine appear to be totally 
ineffective for treatment in these areas, according to studies 
by a French agency, Action Internationale Contre Faim (AICF). 
Although only recently introduced in the northwest, mefloquine 
(marketed in Thailand as Lariam) is following a pattern set in 
Thailand in the 1980's; parasites present in the blood of more 
than half the patients in one AICF study showed resistance to 
the drug. 
  In remote areas, such as Rattanakiri province in the 
northeast, malaria is much more responsive to traditional drugs. 
But Chus Alonso, an AICF epidemiologist, said she had her 
doubts about the scant data sent by medical workers in the 
northeast. The Khmer Rouge and other security threats forestall 
any thorough studies. Security problems also have made it 
difficult for medical personnel and drugs to reach affected 
people, including ethnic minorities. 
  When 300,000 Cambodian refugees returned home from the Thai 
border, it was inevitable that they would carry the resistant 
parasite along with them. Just as likely, the mosquitoes 
bearing the parasite were waiting for them. 
  In fact, while Thailand has earned a bit of international 
notoriety from its chloroquine-resistant parasites, they may 
have originated in Cambodia in the late 1950's and early 60's. 
At that time, northwestern Cambodia had a peculiar malaria 
prevention programme whereby table salt was laced with 
chloroquine. Scientists speculate that prolonged exposure to 
low levels of the drug enabled parasites to build up immunity to 
it. 
  Nonetheless, falciparum malaria in Cambodia differs from the 
Thai version in a way that makes it especially difficult to 
fight. The mosquito carrying the parasite is called Anopheles 
dirus. Its preferred breeding ground is in the forest, in pools 
of water, including those created by an animal's hoof prints. 
This explains why malaria rarely occurs in Cambodian towns or 
in the heavily populated areas surrounding the vast Tonle Sap 
Lake. 
  People clearing forests for farmland or working in forests, 
therefore, are most vulnerable. What worries public health 
officials is that the numbers of such transient people have 
surged with the relative peace of the past two years. They 
include the gem miners in the Pailin area and woodcutters along 
both the Thai and Lao borders. Often they are accompanied by 
their families. 
  Assistance from AICF and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
in the past few years has upgraded the national center's 
treatment services. But a large grant from the British Overseas 
Development Administration coupled with increased access to the 
countryside now has made a much wider control effort possible.

  [Excerpts] It is arbitrary and wrong for a company or an 
individual entrepreneur to fire employees who have AIDS since 
this can increase confusions about AIDS in our society. 
  Such actions can be seen as a reflection of the 
unwillingness 
of the business community to understand how AIDS is transmitted 
and how the HIV virus is spread, as it is understood by the 
international community concerned with AIDS. 
  Dr. Gandung Hartono, MPH [Master of Public Health], former 
Chairman of the National Committee for Responding to AIDS, said 
this to reporters last Monday [29 November] evening in Jakarta 
after leading the swearing-in ceremony for 15 counsellors who 
have joined the nongovernmental organization Mitra Indonesia. 
  Dr. Hudoyo Hupadio, MPH, is the chairman of this 
organization, which was officially established today 1 December 
1993 to coincide with World AIDS Day, and Dr. Gandung Hartono is 
its honorary chairman. 
  A reporter who had heard of a large Indonesian company that 
fired an employee who was infected with the HIV virus, the virus 
suspected of being the cause of AIDS, asked whether firing an 
employee under these circumstances was proper. 
  In response to that question, Gandung said that in the first 
place high-ranking officers of the company that fired the 
employee must not understand the simplest facts about AIDS. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the second place, said Gandung, we have to check to see 
whether the company which fired the employee who had AIDS is 
consistent in its policies, meaning that if a company has a 
policy of always firing employees who have been diagnosed as 
infected with AIDS, the company would have to spend a lot of 
money to administer periodic blood tests to every single 
employee and to the company's high-ranking officers to check 
whether the HIV virus had entered their bloodstream. [passage 
omitted] 
  Anticipating the possibility that many Indonesian companies 
will take such incorrect actions in the future, Gandung urged 
the organizations active in the fight against AIDS to hold 
immediate discussions about manpower infected with AIDS. What 
must be discussed is how a company can treat workers who are 
infected with the AIDS virus in a humanitarian way. 
  By providing every member of society who requires it with 
information and counselling about AIDS, Mitra Indonesia 
emphasizes services to individuals and to small groups, 
especially those who are at high risk, those who are infected 
with the HIV virus and those who already have AIDS. 
  Face-to-face counselling is provided at 78 Kebon Kacang 9 
Street, Jakarta 10240 every Monday through Sunday from 3 pm to 8 
pm. For the time being there are only 15 counsellors from Mitra 
Indonesia who have already sworn to undertake that task in 
accordance with the code of ethics of counsellors for the Mitra 
Indonesia AIDS Hotline. Counselling is also available by 
telephone at 021-3100855. 
  It is reported from Bandung that Hadi Marjanto Abednego, 
Director General for the Eradication of Infectious Diseases and 
for the Improvement of Health in the Residential Environment, 
said that the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region now has the 
highest number of people who are HIV-positive or who have AIDS. 
As of the beginning of last November, there were 58 people with 
AIDS or who were HIV-positive in Jakarta, 26 of them with AIDS 
and 32 who were HIV positive. 
  "The number of cases has definitely increased. This disease 
spreads fast," Abednego told the press in Bandung yesterday. 
  Other provinces that have high rates of AIDS or HIV-positive 
infection are Irian Jaya with 54 patients, Bali with 23 
patients, East Java with 16 patients, Riau with 12 patients and 
West Java with four patients. Nationally, there are 175 people 
who have AIDS or who are HIV positive, 42 of them with AIDS and 
133 who are HIV positive. These patients are spread out over 12 
provinces. 
  "Although the official figures show only 175 people who have 
AIDS or who are HIV-positive, one patient with AIDS or who is 
HIV positive can potentially spread it to 100 others. That's why 
we must be on the alert for the approximately 175,000 other 
patients who are below the surface and who are not in the 
Department of Health's official count," he said. [passage

  [Excerpts] Minister of Health Dr. Sujudi stated that 
medical personnel should not cause panic among AIDS patients and 
that patients with AIDS should not be treated differently from 
sufferers of other diseases. [passage omitted] 
  The Minister of Health also acknowledged that some medical 
personnel are still unwilling to treat AIDS patients for fear of 
being infected. [passage omitted] 
  Sujudi said that there are now 13 million AIDS patients in 
the world. The number of patients continues to rise as time goes 
on. There are now 177 AIDS patients in Indonesia. "To keep down 
the number of AIDS patients, husbands shouldn't play around; 
they should think of their wives at home and the teachings of 
their religion," he added. 
  In the meantime, it was reported from Mataram that starting 
the end of this year the Department of Health will begin the 
official use of a reagent produced by Laboratorium Hepatika 
Mataram, Lombok, which can detect the HIV virus, the cause of 
AIDS, for surveillance purposes. Dr. D. Soemarsidi, director of 
Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram, told KOMPAS last Wednesday (1 
December) that 60,000 units of this HIV test reagent had been 
shipped by his distributor in Jakarta. In addition, 15,000 units 
of this test were sent to the Greater Jakarta Special Capital 
Region Provincial Government for the same purpose. 
  The Department of Health's order for this means of 
surveillance proves that this AIDS reagent, which uses the 
trademark Entebe dipstick HIV and is produced domestically, can 
be used to detect AIDS in our country. The World Health 
Organization has acknowledged the ability of this reagent to 
detect AIDS. This year the Department of Health has put in an 
order for 170,000 tests, which will be filled in the near future. 
  Soemarsidi said that the first acknowledgment came from the 
Department of Microbiology of the WHO Collaborating Center on 
AIDS in Antwerp, Belgium, at the end of last year. Studies show 
that the sensitivity of the reagent to AIDS has reached as high 
as 97 percent, with a specificity of 99.1 percent after it was 
compared with the Western Blot test. 
  A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of Sirirat 
Hospital, Mahidon University, Bangkok (Thailand) shows even 
better results. Reports on the results of the study at the end 
of last year show that the sensitivity level reached 100 
percent, with a specificity of 99.52 percent. The Laboratorium 
Hepatika Mataram has been trying to produce this AIDS reagent 
for commercial purposes since the beginning of this year. 
  Although the WHO evaluation has been very convincing, 
marketing the reagent is not as simple as one might imagine. In 
fact, since they were convinced that the market would absorb 
their product immediately Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram produced 
it in large quantities. But in the middle of 1993 about 60,000 
HIV dipstick tests had to be destroyed because their expiration 
dates had passed. 
  Because of the orders from the Department of Health and from 
the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region Provincial 
Government, Dr. Soemarsidi is optimistic that the product will 
be absorbed by the domestic market. In fact, Laboratorium 
Hepatika Mataram is prepared to produce up to 50,000 tests per 
month. 
  Nevertheless, Soemarsidi explained that this AIDS reagent 
should be produced for human needs, like the production of a 
Hepatitis B reagent in the past. That is why he thinks that the 
reagent should be used for surveillance purposes, even though it 
will be marketed and distributed through distributors appointed 
for that purpose. 
  The selling price of the reagent was not mentioned, but 
KOMPAS noted that the price was fixed last year at 1,500 rupiahs 
per test, much lower than the cost of other detection substances 
which had the same or even lower sensitivity levels.

  [Text] Vientiane, January 29 (KPL) -- Prof. Vannalet 
Latsapho, minister of public health, on January 26, met here 
with the World Bank delegation led by the Asia-Pacific director 
of the World Bank, Washington, to discuss the long term low 
interest bank loan for Laos. 
  The delegation expressed pleasure with the Lao minister that 
after a long period of consideration, the World Bank finally 
granted a loan of U.S. $20 million to Laos. The money will be 
used for medical personnel training and improvement of two 
hospitals, one in Savannakhet Province and the other in Sekong 
Province. The loan will also be used for anti-malaria programme 
in eight provinces and in nation-wide health education, 
particularly in campaigning against AIDS. 
  Minister Vannalet Latsapho also asked the World Bank 
officials to seek grants to additionally support the activities.

  [Excerpt] Penang, Sun. -- The monthly rate of increase of 
new Human Immuno-Defeciency Virus (HIV) cases has dropped 
slightly to about 100 a month compared to between 200 and 300 
cases several months ago. 
  Deputy Health Minister Farid Ariffin said this was due to 
the 
significant increase in public awareness of Acquired Immunity 
Defeciency Syndrome (AIDS) and HIV, among Malaysians. 
  "Most people are now beginning to take precautions to avoid 
being infected as many are more aware about the disease now than 
they were a couple of years ago." 
  To date, Farid said, the number of those tested positive for 
HIV was about 7,400. 
  He said almost all Malaysians above the age of 15 were aware 
about the disease. 
  He said this included those living in the rural and remote 
areas and even intravenous dadah [drug] addicts who were still 
by far the largest group identified as having AIDS or HIV. 
  "Despite their awareness about the disease, most drug 
addicts 
continue to share hypodermic needles to inject themselves with 
dadah and seem to be more obsessed with getting a `kick' than 
fear of getting AIDS or dying." 
  Farid was speaking after the opening of a counselling 
seminar 
organised by the Islah Counselling Unit of the Penang branch of 
the Malaysian Association of Jamaah Islah (JIM) here. [passage

the South, Pregnant Women Have High Incidence"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Dr. Anan Sulaiman, Director of 
the Area 12 Health Center, said that the increase in AIDS among 
women and children in the seven lower provinces of the South was 
accelerating. For pregnant women who were examined at the 
hospital it was found that 7 percent had the AIDS virus. There 
were many that were not examined by the hospital, and it was 
thought that the figure might be higher than this. 
  Dr. Anan said the reason for the increased spread of AIDS in 
the seven provinces of the lower South was that there was still 
little awareness of AIDS prevention in any group. The use of 
female prostitutes caused more and more wives to acquire the 
virus from their husbands. Changing the custom of using 
prostitutes, if it were possible, would reduce the incidence of 
AIDS. [passage omitted]

Battle AIDS"] 
  [Excerpt] Dr. Wichai Chaichitwanitkun, an MP 
from Udon Thani of the New Aspiration Party spoke to reporters 
as Vice-chairman of the Public Health Commission. He said that 
at the meeting of those involved with AIDS from the Ministry of 
Public Health, the National Committee for AIDS Prevention, the 
National Assembly, and experts in AIDS it was learned that the 
actual figure for those with the AIDS virus throughout the 
country was about 600,000 people. Areas with a high incidence 
were the North and Bangkok. Little was found in the Northeast, 
the South and the East. If one person in 100 had AIDS, it would 
be considered very serious. 
  Dr. Wichai also said that in 5 to 6 years there would be 
300,000 people with the complete AIDS symptoms. At present the 
Ministry of Public Health and private institutions had 90,000 
beds for patients. How would these patients be cared for? The 
Ministry of Public Health would have to find new ways to care 
for both AIDS patients and ordinary patients. How could they 
both be dealt with? What he was worried about was how to get the 
Thai people throughout the country to refrain from spreading the 
disease, especially in regard to the use of prostitutes. 
Prostitutes were the most serious cause of the spread of AIDS, 
accounting for 90 percent of the cases. Children contracting the 
virus from their mothers accounted for 5 percent of the cases. 
The rest involved drug addiction and hypodermic needles, but the 
percentage was small. [passage omitted] 
  He said that the statistics for those dying from AIDS now 
was 
one and one-half per day. The situation was considered to be 
very serious especially in some provinces of the North such as 
Chiang Mai Province, Chiang Rai Province and Lampang Province 
where one person per day was dying. He wanted those who did not 
have the AIDS virus to see people suffering from AIDS. Then they 
would know how bad it was for these patients just to lay down 
and wait to die, and how much the patients suffered in the 3 to 
4 years it took to die. Government units in every ministry, 
bureau, department; University students; secondary students; and 
primary students would have to help in the battle to make the 
people realize the danger of AIDS and stop thinking that it was 
not important.

<F P=106> [Article by Aphalak Phatiyasewi in Chiang Mai] </F>
  [Text] Thailand's first official vaccine trial on HlV/AIDS 
prevention is likely to begin in April by the Thai Red Cross 
Society on non-HlV/AIDS carriers. 
  Thai Red Cross Society AIDS Program director Praphan 
Phanuphak said the AIDS preventive vaccine developed by United 
Biomedical Inc of the United States would be tried on volunteers 
of a low-risk group, after formal approval is received from the 
National AIDS Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai, on February 14. 
  He said the Public Health Ministry had finally accepted the 
need for development of vaccines to prevent HIV infection in 
Thailand and had therefore given the green light. 
  The vaccine, already tested on people in the United States, 
Australia, and China, had proved to be satisfactory, he said. 
  Dr. Praphan said the first phase of the trial would require 
24 volunteers, to observe the side effects that could be caused, 
and 100 to 200 volunteers to test the vaccine. 
  The results of the first stage of the trial would be known 
after eight months, whereas that of the second stage would be 
known within two years. 
  The vaccine trial would be publicized widdy [as received] 
because volunteers, non-HlV carriers of the lower risk group, 
would have to be carefully screened, he said. 
  Dr. Praphan said the volunteers would have to be given full 
details of the trial because out of the 24 volunteers, some 
would be given 100 micrograms of vaccine, some 500 micrograms 
and some would be given placebos, without making them aware of 
what injection they have received. 
  He said the volunteers would have to be told that the 
vaccine 
might be of benefit or might be of no use at all to them. 
  "The drawback of the vaccine trial is that during the 
initial 
trial period volunteers will have anti-HlV positive antibody in 
their blood," Dr. Praphan said. 
  However, after some time this could be separated from the 
HIV 
positive infection that caused AIDS. 
  According to Dr. Praphan, the Public Health Ministry is 
opening up to the vaccine trial because the AIDS problem is 
rapidly increasing in Thailand. 
  "Even though the news media criticizes Thailand for using 
its 
people as guinea pigs, the ministry will ignore it because no 
time can be wasted on this problem." 
  Other than the vaccine, Dr. Praphan said a new type of 
medicine, known as "protease inhibitor", was being developed in 
the United States and it was hoped it would be used by Thais by 
the end of the year. 
  He said this new medicine would be different from AZT 
because 
it would not allow the virus to become active and would allow 
only the production of a defective virus. 
  Dr. Praphan called on the Public Health Ministry and 
researchers of the country to encourage vaccine trials -- and 
not to bother whether the medicine had been licensed -- in order 
to obtain vaccines at a reasonable cost.

incidence of this fever to be heavy one year and light the next. 
According to the statistics from the beginning of the year until 
the present, there had been 714 cases of the fever and four 
deaths. According to a public health report Latyao District had 
the most cases with 150. Branch District Maewong had 114 cases 
and two deaths. The municipal area of Nakhon Sawan had the most 
for a municipal area with 87 cases. The Chum Saeng municipal 
area had 16 cases. The Ta Khli municipal area had six cases. The 
sick were generally between 1 and 14. 
  Dr. Thawat said that since those sick were generally between 
1 and 14, most were of school age or were students. This year 
public health was receiving a great deal of assistance from the 
educational administration in combating the spread of mosquitos 
and controlling mosquitos. [passage omitted] 
  In regard to the spread of dengue fever in Nakhon Sawan, 
although the statistics public health had received from 
affiliated units had not been high, nevertheless the 
investigation done by MATICHON in private hospitals and clinics 
indicated that there were very many who were sick.

"Nong Chok" Champion for Highest Number of Sick"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Dr. Warawit Lepnak, Director of 
the Bangkok Health Office, said that heavy rains and flooding 
provided many breeding places for mosquitos and people could be 
more at risk from dengue fever. So the health office had been 
working to destroy these breeding places throughout Bangkok. The 
statistics for dengue fever for the past ten years indicated 
that the highest incidence had been in 1987 when there were a 
total of 12,190 cases in Bangkok and 18 deaths. The pattern of 
the disease was to spread every other year or every two years. 
When Bangkok battled the disease, the number of cases was 
reduced. 
  He said that this year the number of cases of dengue fever 
had been higher from January until August. There had been a 
total of 1,096 cases but no loss of life. If one compared the 
statistics for the number of cases in various areas based on the 
population, one found that Nong Chok had the highest incidence. 
Next came Yannawa, Sathon, Bangrak and Thonburi in that order. 
If one considered the total number of cases in the top ten 
areas, Thonburi was first with 75 cases, Huai Khwang was next 
with 61 cases, Yannawa with 59, Sathon with 58, Phasi Charoen 
with 56, Chomthong with 45, Ratsadon Burana with 42, Phrakhonong 
with 40, Bangkapi with 39, and Dusit with 36. 
  He also said that although the situation with dengue fever 
in 
Bangkok had not reached the stage of epidemic, we should be 
careful after the rains not to throw away anything which might 
hold water as these could provide breeding places for mosquitos. 
There was a mistaken belief that breeding places for mosquitos 
could only be in waste water. In fact mosquitos could breed in 
clean water.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tak Combats Liver Flukes, Organizes </F>
Units To Examine for it in Every District"] 
  [Text] Dr. Phiphat Yingseri, a Tak Province public health 
doctor, said that a random survey of laboratory examinations 
indicated that liver flukes were a serious public health problem 
for Tak Province. In June 1992 it was found that 328 inhabitants 
out of 717 in three villages in the municipal district of Tak 
suffered from this disease. It had been contracted by eating 
food prepared with raw or half-cooked fish. It was found a great 
deal among laborers. It caused chronic inflammation of the bile 
ducts, and, long-term, it could cause cancer of the bile ducts 
and liver. 
  Therefore the Tak Province public health office advised the 
people of Tak how to prevent contracting liver flukes by not 
eating raw fish and half-cooked fish, by defecating in hygienic 
toilets, and by washing their hands every time before eating. 
The office also devised a plan to prevent and control liver 
flukes by teaching hygiene to each target group and by setting 
up mobile units to examine feces for the people of every 
district until October. 
  He invited everyone to ask for a fecal examination from the 
mobile fecal examination teams in each district or from any 
nearby hospital. The fee for the examination was 10 baht. The 
cost of the medicine to treat the disease was another 10 baht if 
the test indicated the disease.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruangsak Lathainin: "Liver Flukes in Roi Et No </F>
Longer a Public Health Problem"] 
  [Text] "Liver flukes" were a serious problem for the 
Northeast. From examining feces it was learned that 35 percent 
of the population had liver flukes. In Roi Et Province alone it 
was found that 42.61 percent had liver flukes in 1988. In that 
same year more than 500 people in Roi Et died from liver flukes 
-- they generally had liver cancer caused by liver flukes. The 
report also stated that those who died from this disease were of 
working age, and so this was a great loss for the economy and 
the society. 
  An important cause of this disease was the preference for 
raw 
food, especially raw fish, of the people of the Northeast. In 
addition they did not have sufficient toilets to break the cycle 
of the disease. 
  Therefore to correct these problems they sought to change 
the 
preference for raw food and to have toilets for every house. Roi 
Et Province officials began this effort in earnest in 1984. 
Initially the approach was to cope with the disease; they set up 
teams to check for and treat the disease in the province. Then 
in 1989 they changed their approach and attacked the disease 
with the GTZ [expansion unknown] program of the German 
government, which worked with the Department of Communicable 
Disease Control of the Ministry of Public Health and with Roi Et 
Province. But these efforts could only reach half the area and 
only 600,000 people. The rest was handled by various district 
hospitals. 
  In 1992 Roi Et Province employed a more concentrated 
strategy. It attacked the problem of liver flukes using three 
activities: 1. checking for and treating the disease -- public 
health officials were trained to find the disease and mobile 
units were set up to go to the villages; 2. efforts were made to 
set up water toilets -- the goal was 100 percent; 3. efforts 
were made to change behavior with emphasis on changing the habit 
of eating raw fish. Continuous efforts were made in the 
Northeast to stop the eating of raw fish from 1989 to 1990. The 
role of popular organizations was encouraged with the effort to 
set up "villages free of liver flukes". 
  The results of these persistent efforts were demonstrated in 
1992 when the incidence of the disease, which had been as high 
as 42.61 percent, was reduced to only 15.37 percent. The 
percentage with toilets had risen to 92.21 percent, and in many 
districts 100 percent of the houses had such toilets. There were 
1,373 villages which were free of liver flukes. 
  Just when victory over this disease seemed close, Roi Et 
Province mobilized its forces steadfastly again in 1993. It 
trained public health officials at the subdistrict level to be 
able to examine everyone for the disease. This time they 
conducted examinations and provided care in every subdistrict 
and village, and were able to make another 783 villages free of 
the disease. Two feces examinations were given, which provided 
reliable results for the statistical reports. In addition an 
"assembly of those free of liver flukes" was organized to 
provide more strength for the battle. 
  Roi Et Province used village level communicators such as 
artists and singers to provide health education to the various 
villages. This was considered very effective. 
  The examinations and care reached 74.79 percent of the 
people 
in 1993, and incidence of the disease was found to be only 8.13 
percent. There were villages which could be announced free of 
this disease and in which 100 percent of the houses had toilets. 
Roi Et Province officials asked the Area 7 Office of 
Communicable Disease Control in Ubon Ratchathani to cooperate by 
sending experts to assess the results and determine the 
incidence and severity of the disease, as well as the knowledge, 
intentions and behavior of the people using the Cluster Sampling 
Technique in 30 locations during June 1993. It was found that 
the incidence of the disease was only 10 percent, which was not 
felt to be a public health problem. 
  After the successful completion of this survey, province 
officials held a celebration on 21 September with fish as food 
for the project to control liver flukes at the Roi Et Province 
Public Health Office. 
  It was felt that Roi Et Province had controlled liver flukes 
such that the disease was stage one. This fulfilled the initial 
goal which was to be able to announce that it was a province 
without a liver fluke problem. But they would have to continue 
the battle to stop the people of Roi Et from eating raw fish 
completely and to wipe out liver flukes 100 percent. No one but 
the people of Roi Et could make this dream come true.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Reducing Leprosy to One in 10,000"] </F>
  [Text] S.N.Ph. Thira Ramsut, the Chairman of the Medical 
Prevention Group of Thailand and a doctor who was an expert in 
the treatment of leprosy, said that Thailand could reduce 
leprosy to one in 10,000 before the year 2000, the next health 
year, in accordance with the schedule of the World Health 
Organization. Therefore they would proceed quickly to send 
personnel to care for patients in the countryside, to train 
personnel and to disseminate information about this disease. 
  This expert in the disease also said that leprosy was a 
contagious disease in Thailand and that there had been no way of 
treating it 40 years ago. It had been similar to AIDS today. The 
incidence of the disease now was 1.36 per 10,000. There were 
only 6,780 registered for treatment of the disease at various 
hospitals. The numbers had fallen a great deal since the survey 
done in 1953 when it was found that Thailand had 150,000 
suffering from it. 
  He said that after the survey for leprosy at that time, the 
Leprosy Project for Thailand worked with the World Health 
Organization and UNICEF in sending mobile teams to find leprosy 
sufferers in various villages, and they set up treatment areas 
in villages or clinics to provide monthly treatments until the 
symptoms improved. In 1984 a new medicine was discovered to 
treat those sick with the disease. Treatment had taken 16 years. 
With the new medicine it required only two years. And for 
patients in whom no disease bacteria or very few disease 
bacteria were found and for whom treatmant had required about 
six years, the treatment could be shortened to six months.

<F P=106> [Article by Siri Antharin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today, the number of people in the northern 
region of Thailand who have diseases of the eye, particularly 
cataracts, is increasing. But there are very few hospitals, 
either public or private, that are prepared to treat eye 
disorders. Moreover, there is a shortage of equipment used in 
conducting eye examinations, treating eye diseases, and 
performing eye operations. There is also a lack of technical 
equipment used in analyzing things to find the causes of the eye 
disorders. 
  Because of this, those who need immediate medical attention 
for an eye disorder risk damaging their eyes because they can't 
obtain emergency treatment. They might even go blind. Besides 
this, another very serious problem concerning this is that there 
is a shortage of eye specialists or ophthalmologists. In Chiang 
Mai, there are only ten ophthalmologists and 12 others who are 
interns or who are studying to be ophthalmologists. 
  Looking at the number of hospitals that have the 
capabilities 
to treat eye disorders, it can be seen that there are only two 
such hospitals in the north. One is the Maharat Hospital in 
Chiang Mai City, a public hospital that the people refer to as 
the "Flower Garden Hospital." The other is the Chiang Mai Saint 
Peter's Hospital, which is the first private optometrical 
hospital. This is now the most modern facility in the north. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. Phithak Kitcharoen, the director of Saint Peter's 
Hospital, is serving society in cooperation with the Lomoson 
Foundation and various other organizations in the form of funds 
to aid people with eye disorders. [passage omitted] 
  Saint Peter's Hospital has mobilized a number of elderly 
ophthalmologists and some modern equipment and provides service 
like a hotel. From a business standpoint, it will be a long time 
before the hospital breaks even. This hospital has 23 rooms and 
30 beds, including deluxe, special, and ordinary rooms. Within 
several months of opening, it was crowded with patients even 
though it provided services 24 hours a day. Thus, administrators 
had to mobilize another 15 million baht in order to install 
additional modern equipment. 
  Based on hospital reports, this hospital has treated 
patients 
from throughout the country, not just the 17 northern provinces. 
All of those who have come here for treatment have serious 
disorders. This is a sign that government units must quickly 
take steps to deal with this situation before it is too late. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. Phithak said that eye disorders are very worrisome 
today. 
This includes cataracts and glaucoma. In particular, the eyes of 
a large number of farmers have been damaged by paddy ears or 
leaves of certain plants without these people being aware of the 
danger. When their eyes become irritated, they rub them or wash 
them with water. When their eyes start to hurt a lot, they go to 
a local hospital for treatment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zagreb (HINA) -- The Epidemiological Service of the 
Croatian Public Health Institute reported that the number of 
contagious disease cases remain stable; the occurrence of 
influenza was confirmed on Saturday but it is not epidemic. 
  In December, 2,513 fell ill from chicken pox, which is 
spreading, and 1,654 had strep throat. Epidemiologist Dr. 
Borislav Aleraj reported that, contrary to expectations for this 
time of the year, hepatitis infections declined from 119 in 
December 1992 to 81 in November and 62 in December 1993. 
  According to Aleraj, it was expected that in December the 
number of trichinosis infections will decline; 19 persons fell 
ill after having eaten undercooked domestically bred pork. There 
were 321 persons infected by salmonella, a normal seasonal 
decline compared to 427 cases in November and a slight increase 
in comparison with December 1992. 
  In December, two more persons, both from a high-risk group, 
were infected with AIDS. There were no reports of typhoid fever; 
throughout 1993, there were only three separate cases reported. 
They were taken care of and did not cause new infections, Dr. 
Aleraj added. 
  Occurrences of diseases that can be eliminated through 
systematic vaccination are rare or nonexistent. In December only 
one case of measles and one case of malaria were reported; there 
were a few other cases during the year, originating in one of 
the tropical countries.

<F P=106> [Article by (TA SR): "Swine Plague in Nove Zamky District"] </F>
  [Text] The first incidence on the territory of the Slovak 
Republic of the infectious classical-type swine plague was 
recorded on 7 December. The virus was detected in animals raised 
on a private farm in Chramec, in the district of Rimavska 
Sobota. The infection spread graudally to six more private 
farms. According to the information provided by the State 
Veterinary Administration, it was possible to identify the 
source of the infection: The virus originated in two wild boars 
recently shot in the vicinity of a breeding station owned by the 
Agricultural Cooperative in Chramec. Subsequently, the infection 
was also diagnosed in animals kept by privately operating 
farmers in the villages of Blhovce, Hodejov, and Janice. 
  As a protective measure, hunts for wild boars were then 
ordered in areas surrounding these places. From samples taken 
from the wild animals shot in these hunts, it was established 
that the plague virus was present only in those coming from the 
area of the villages of Drna and Hajnacka. As of now, there are 
no reports of the disease having spread to the large hog farms 
in the Rimavska Sobota district. However, on 29 December, an 
additional locality was added to the number of those affected by 
the infection. The Agricultural Cooperative Farm "Kolta" in 
Stara Dedina reported a number of animals infected by the virus. 
Strict preventive measures were immediately adopted on both that 
farm and in the local protected zones. On 30 December, the 
District Disease Prevention Commission decided to liquidate all 
exposed animals on the farm. Until last night, altogether 1,297 
animals either died or had to be destroyed. 
  In view of the current emergency, the State Veterinary 
Administration has published a reminder addressed to all 
breeders of hogs that states that it is their responsibility to 
follow and strictly apply all appropriate preventive measures 
authorized by the Central Commission for Disease Prevention on 
15 July.

  [Text] Representatives of Cuba and Colombia are analyzing, 
in Bogota, ways of implementing collaboration between the Public 
Health Ministries of Cuba and Colombia. A communique from the 
Colombian health authorities says that Jorge Antelo Perez, 
Cuba's first vice minister of public health, is heading a 
delegation of seven physicians and epidemiologists who are in 
Bogota for that purpose. The agreements signed in Havana in 
January by Colombian Public Health Minister Juan Londono cover 
aspects of, among other things: vaccinations, epidemiological 
monitoring, primary health care, medications, tropical diseases, 
hospital equipment maintenance, and training of human resources. 
  Cuba's work on the meningitis vaccine was analyzed during 
the 
meetings the Cuban delegation has had with Colombian Deputy 
Public Health Minister (Eduardo Alvarado) and other Colombian 
officials. 
  Cuba is going to sell vaccines to Colombia. The Cuban and 
Colombian delegations have agreed to proceed to the acquisition 
of vaccines against meningitis on the part of Colombia. The 
number of doses and the manner of financing are being studied. 
  Our vice minister of public health, Jorge Antelo Perez, said 
we stand ready to deliver the 2.5 million doses of hepatitis-B 
vaccine agreed on during Colombian Public Health Minister Juan 
Londono's visit to Havana. The representatives of the two 
nations also made progress as regards the agreements having to 
do with designing the expanded plan for immunizations in 
Colombia over the next five years. All the matters under study 
have to do with the possibility of supplying generic Cuban 
medicines to remote areas of Colombia. 
  In the area of epidemiological monitoring, they worked to 
improve the systems for registering and identifying diseases 
such as dengue fever and [word indistinct].

  [Text] During the 10 years that AIDS has existed in 
Colombia it has officially caused the deaths of 1,800 persons. 
However, based on data from the National Survey of Knowledge, 
Attitudes, and Behaviors Related to Sexually Transmitted 
Diseases - HIV/AIDS Infection, there could be over 121,000 HIV 
carriers in Colombia. 
  This investigation, the most extensive now available, was 
ordered by the Deputy Directorate of Health Services of the ISS 
[expansion not given] from Profamilia, and was based on 
interviews with 18,000 people. 
  According to the report, "20.3 percent of the tests of men 
and 1.3 percent of the tests of women were positive. This means 
that, of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women could 
be HIV-positive or what amounts to the same thing, 35 of each 
10,000 inhabitants might be infected with the HIV virus. 
  Minister of Health Juan Luis Londono de la Cuesta said this 
was a very high figure. According to the ministry's projections, 
there might be 50,000 HIV carriers in Colombia. 
  As in other parts of the world, the official figures in 
Colombia are not very realistic, because of the enormous 
underreporting of AIDS. 
  Although the figure is disturbing in itself, what is even 
worse is the Colombian population's profound ignorance about 
this disease. 
  All the work done since June 1983, when the first case of 
AIDS in Colombia was found in Cartagena, has apparently not 
accomplished very much. 
  According to this survey, 89 percent of the people 
interviewed said they knew what AIDS is, but when questioned in 
greater depth, it became apparent that the Colombian people know 
very little. 
  For example, 54.5 percent did not have the slightest idea 
that AIDS was a fatal disease, and barely half knew that it is 
transmitted sexually. Only 2.7 percent knew that it can be 
transmitted through blood, and 1.8 percent that it can be 
transmitted perinatally (from the mother to the fetus). 
  A significant percentage, 16 percent of the population, 
continues to believe that it afflicts homosexuals, prostitutes, 
bisexuals, and drug addicts; 5 percent said that it is a plague 
or a disease like cancer; 1.3 percent believe it is a new 
disease imported into Colombia; and 1 percent think it is caused 
by immorality. 
  While 73 percent know there is still no cure for AIDS, 9.5 
percent think there is a cure, and 18 percent do not know. 
  Once again it was clear that in the area of sex education 
the 
youngest people and those with the highest educational levels 
are the best informed. 
<H5>  I Am Immortal, I Am Not At Risk </H5>
  According to this investigation, 72 percent of the Colombian 
people do not think they are at risk for AIDS; 21 percent think 
they are at risk, and 7 percent do not know. Of people who have 
been sexually active, 23 percent of the men and 25 percent of 
the women think they have a high risk of contracting AIDS. 
  Among persons who believe they are at risk, 4.6 percent of 
the men think it is because their partner was unfaithful; 3.6 
percent because of their sexual practices; 7 percent because 
they have had casual sex with anybody; 1.4 percent because they 
needed a blood transfusion or blood products; and a small part 
because they have shared syringes, are at risk because of their 
job, or because they are in contact with items belonging to 
persons who are infected. 
  Among the 20 percent of the women, 12 percent think they may 
be at risk because their partner was unfaithful; 0.4 percent 
because of their sexual practices; 0.4 percent because they have 
had casual sexual relations with anybody; and the rest because 
of blood transfusions, sharing syringes, because of their job, 
or from contact with items belonging to infected persons. 
  "In urban areas there is believed to be a greater AIDS risk 
than in rural areas. In Antioquia and central Colombia, people 
think they have a higher risk, while in the east they believe 
they have a reduced risk," stated the investigation report. 
  The people who believe they cannot be infected attribute 
this 
to being monogamous (42 percent); not having sexual relations 
(14 percent); and not engaging in high-risk practices (10 
percent). 
  "People who are not now in a stable relationship, young 
people who have not completed primary or secondary school, 
people in Antioquia, the central region, the Valle, Tolima, 
Huila, and Santander regions say they have engaged in high-risk 
behaviors." 
<H5>  Fidelity, the Best Method </H5>
  Over half the population (53 percent) thinks that AIDS can 
be 
avoided by fidelity to a single partner, always using a condom 
(34 percent); not having casual relations (26 percent); not 
sharing syringes (13 percent), and requiring blood tests (11 
percent). For 5 percent of the population, the best 
AIDS-prevention method is use of a method that never fails, 
abstinence. 
  A little over half the women believe fidelity is the best 
way 
to prevent disease; 28 percent believe in using a condom; and 24 
percent in not having casual sexual relations. Surprisingly, 17 
percent think AIDS can be prevented by avoiding contact with 
infected persons. 
  People under 45, those now in a stable relationship, and 
people with a higher level of education know the importance of 
fidelity, while younger people and those who are single or 
separated are aware of the need to use a condom. 
  On the contrary, older and less well-educated people are the 
most fearful about contact with persons infected with the AIDS 
virus.

<H5>  With or Without a Condom </H5>
  The results of the National Survey of Knowledge, Attitudes, 
and Behaviors Related to STD's-HIV/AIDS Infection, found some 
very interesting points concerning the sexual behavior of 
Colombians. 
  While 95.6 percent of the Colombian people know about 
condoms, only 5 percent of the population uses condoms. 
  This contrasts with 34 percent of the people who mention 
using condoms as a method of preventing AIDS; it seems that when 
having sexual relations, they prefer a natural approach. 
  One reason for this last-minute change may be that 35 
percent 
of sexual relations take place under the influence of alcohol. 
  It is surprising that the 84 percent of the women whose 
partners have used a condom at some time have used it as a 
contraceptive rather than as protection from disease. 
  One factor that will be used in AIDS and STD prevention 
campaigns is that 92 percent of the adults in Colombia have had 
sexual relations (97 percent of the men and 88 percent of the 
women). The strange thing is that 91 percent of single men and 
51 percent of single women have had sexual relations. 
  Of people who have had casual sexual relations, 41 percent 
of 
the men and 49 percent of the women did not obtain information 
about their partner's sexual history.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office and the National 
Health Department yesterday issued a new warning about 
Colombia's blood banks. 
  The report by these two organizations says that although 
safety requirements to avoid AIDS contamination have increased, 
the situation is still devastating. 
  Officials from the Attorney General's Office and from the 
Health Department said that 72 blood banks -- of the 278 in 
Colombia -- lack scientific controls to ensure that their blood 
is not contaminated, and 195 blood banks do not fully comply 
with the scientific and administrative requirements established 
by law. 
  Of the 278 blood banks, 32 conduct no serological tests for 
the HIV virus (AIDS); 50 conduct no tests for hepatitis B, 150 
do not test for hepatitis C, and five do not test for syphilis. 
  Moreover, only three blood banks have an operating license. 
In Antioquia 24 blood banks do not comply with the licensing 
requirement; in Atlantico, 13; in Bolivar, eight; Boyaca, 32; 
Cundinamarca, 39; Caldas, four; Caqueta, eight; Cordoba, 13; 
Huila, five; Magdalena, 13; Narino, six; Norte de Santander, 14; 
Santander, 27; Tolima, 13; and Valle del Cauca, 22. 
  In the departments of Boyaca, Cundinamarca, Magdalena, 
Putumayo, Santander, and Sucre, the health centers that store 
blood supplies do not have adequate technical equipment for 
preserving and processing blood. 
  Another defect the investigators found is insufficient care 
in handling the blood donors' medical record. This document is 
used to evaluate the health status of anyone who gives blood.

  [Excerpt] Health authorities have confirmed that the 
country is facing an epidemic of dengue fever. They stated that 
at least 18 cases have been confirmed in Barranca and that there 
are another 500 cases where dengue fever is suspected (400 in 
Puntarenas and 100 in Liberia, Province of Guanacaste). 
  This announcement by the Costa Rican Institute for Research 
and Education in Nutrition and Health (INCIENSA) led authorities 
in the Ministry of Health to reconfirm the emergency which was 
declared on 27 September, when it was reported for the first 
time that there was a possibility that the disease -- which was 
supposedly eradicated 50 years ago -- was reappearing. 
  Although the first samples [of suspected material] have been 
sent to the Reference Center of Honduras, a diagnosis has not 
been made, because of the medical strike called in that country 
at least two weeks ago. 
  Due to the epidemic, the first action taken was to establish 
health quarantines in Puntarenas, Liberia, and Valle Central, 
according to Emilia Leon, acting minister of health. 
  In the port of Pacifico the disease spread rapidly. The 
first 
case was identified on 14 October in Barranca. From there it 
spread to Esparza -- where there are at least two persons ill 
with the disease -- and to other places in the province. 
  Ana Gabriela Ross, director of the South Central Region of 
the Ministry of Health, stated that mosquitoes have been 
detected in the Cantons of Desamparados, Goicoechea, Alajuelita, 
Coronado, Tibas, Moravia, and Montes de Oca, as well as in the 
Districts of Hatillo and San Sebastian. 
  She added: "In June several suspected cases were reported in 
Barrio Mexico, Ciudad Colon, and Tibas." Ross did not specify 
the number of persons affected, but she said that they showed 
symptoms of dengue fever: headaches and pains in the joints of 
the body, skin rashes, general discomfort, and feelings of 
tiredness around the eyes. 
  Health authorities stated: "Mosquitoes transmitting dengue 
and yellow fever are found throughout the country." They 
confirmed that they are taking emergency action to prevent the 
outbreak from spreading to a larger number of people. 
  Unofficial calculations indicate that if the pace at which 
the disease has spread continues as it has up to the present, it 
could affect between 250,000 and 500,000 people. 
  The government has allocated 30 million Costa Rican colones 
for the purchase of insecticides to fumigate the areas of 
greatest danger and especially those homes where symptoms of the 
disease have been detected. 
  Panama will loan to Costa Rica two machines equipped to 
fumigate the streets with "Malathion," a powerful agrochemical 
which is soluble in water and which is lethal for the "Aedes 
Aegyptis" mosquito [which transmits the disease]. 
  According to Acting Minister of Health Leon, the 200 
containers of "Malathion" in storage in the warehouses and the 
eight fumigators on hand (including the two machines which 
Panama is providing) are enough for a considerable period of 
time. Five of the fumigators will be sent to Puntarenas, and the 
remaining three, to Guanacaste. 
  For his part Jose Luis Garces, director of the Malaria 
Department of the Ministry of Health, said that 14 technicians 
experienced in primary care have been sent from Limon to 
Puntarenas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After approximately four years of hospitalization, 
under the new outpatient program, some 30 carriers of the AIDS 
[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] virus are already in one 
way or another working at their [former] work centers. Here is 
journalist Guillermo Morales with exclusive details for this 
newscast. 
  Morales: Manuel Santin, national director of 
Hygiene and Epidemiology [name and title as heard] said these 
people are asymptomatic and are back at their respective work 
centers, where they worked before contracting the virus. He 
explained: 
  (Santin): "These people had been maintaining their 
work status; that is, the Cuban Government protects their right 
to remain in their work groups. So, preferentially -- so long as 
it does not constitute a health risk because of, say, the 
intensity of the work or some potential danger inherent in the 
work -- the person will continue doing the work he did in the 
past. Where there may be limitations, where the type of work 
might constitute a health risk to the person, proper adjustments 
will be made -- with the technical committee and leadership at 
his work center -- and alternatives will be sought for him." 
  Since 1983, when the AIDS monitoring and prevention program 
began, Cuba has reported 987 HIV-positive people: 702 males and 
285 females. Of these, 230 have developed AIDS, and 147 have 
died to-date, according to latest statistics. This data speaks 
for itself when worldwide, 4,500 people are infected with AIDS 
every day. 
  Bear in mind that one HIV-positive person or AIDS patient 
costs the nation some $42,000 per year, and that the new 
outpatient system does not deprive those who are able and wish 
to avail themselves of these possibilities from doing so. This 
was made very clear by Manuel Santin, director of hygiene and 
epidemiology in Cuba. 
  (Santin): "(The nation) is maintaining our 
program of AIDS prevention and monitoring, giving it high 
priority. These patients, carriers of the virus or suffering 
from the disease, will continue to be attended to with the same 
priority. This investment by the state, proof of its humanistic 
policy and practice, will be maintained. At no time is it 
contingent upon economic considerations. 
  "The resources for this, though limited because of the 
nation's economy, are available, so these people will receive 
the humane, just treatment they require." 
  Alarm, concern, surprise over incorporation of carriers of 
the AIDS virus into your work centers? What if it were you? What 
would you think? 
  In future broadcasts: What HIV-positive people and their 
colleagues at their workplaces think. This is the national radio 
newscast.

  [Text] Leaders of the Association for the Development of 
the Shipibo-Conivo Culture of Peru have denounced the chief of 
the Regional Health Directorate of Ucayali for embezzling more 
than 73,000 soles that the Health Ministry allocated for it to 
combat the various epidemics that have been ravaging this 
extensive jungle region. 
  Owing to this serious irregularity, which has prevented 
medications from being purchased, there are currently more than 
250 cases of cholera, 200 cases of malaria, and 75 cases of 
yellow fever, and more than 15,000 natives have been struck by 
tuberculosis in Shipibo communities in this region. 
  One-thousand five-hundred of the victims died from January 
to 
October of this year owing to the lack of medications and 
specialized medical care. 
  A delegation from the Association for the Development of the 
Shipibo-Conivo Culture, headed by coordinator Andres Castaneda 
Saavedra, arrived in the capital to explain this tragic 
situation to government officials. 
  The coordinator told LA REPUBLICA that about 35,000 members 
of this ethnic group in 108 native communities have suffered 
losses because of the flooding of the Ucayali River, aside from 
the diseases that the flooding has caused. 
  The flooding started in January of this year and resumed in 
recent months, burying huge fields of rice, yucca, corn, and 
beans in the Ucayali Valley under more than two meters of water. 
The local communities consume these crops themselves. 
  All of the crops were lost, and since other food was not 
forthcoming from elsewhere in the country, owing to the lack of 
roads and vehicles, hunger began to decimate the population, 
causing the more than 15,000 cases of tuberculosis. 
  The huge swamps and pools of stagnant water became breeding 
grounds for cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, which spread 
rapidly, especially among children and the elderly. 
  The chiefs of the native communities worriedly gathered 
together early in the year and asked the Health Ministry 
directly to declare a state of emergency in the Ucayali region. 
  The ministry did not declare a health emergency in the 
region 
until this past October and on the seventh of the month approved 
73,363 new soles in funds to combat these epidemics in Ucayali. 
  The money was sent to the director of the Ucayali Health 
Region, Dr. Antonio Mundine Medrano, who was supposed to 
purchase medications and see to it that patients were treated 
immediately. 
  Nevertheless, the incidence of cholera, malaria, and yellow 
fever remained unchanged, and patients seemed to be receiving no 
treatment whatsoever. 
  The Shipibo culture association contacted the chiefs of the 
various native communities to check whether medicine had been 
received or medical care delivered. 
  All said that they had received no medications or visits 
from 
physicians, and the hovels that function as medical posts have 
lacked basic items for medical care since last year. 
  According to Castaneda Saavedra, Dr. Mundine Medrano has not 
accounted for the alleged aid shipment to the communities that 
requested it, contending only that the aid has already been 
distributed and that if it did not reach certain communities, it 
did reach others, which he did not specify.

  [Text] Tuberculosis cases declined by 2 percent in Peru 
from 1992 to 1993, and 54,000 people currently suffer from the 
disease, Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne Uyanguren revealed 
yesterday at the ceremony during which the World Food Program 
(PMA) turned over 10 laboratory microscopes for diagnosing TB. 
  The coordinator of the United Nations System and 
representative of the aforementioned program, Pierre Den Baas, 
presented the modern microscopes, which carry a price tag of 
$7,600. The Health Ministry's National Tuberculosis Program will 
use them in the departments of Cajamarca, Cuzco, Puno, and Lima. 
<H5>  Diagnosis and Treatment Guaranteed </H5>
  Freundt-Thurne indicated that his ministry intends to 
continue reducing the number of tuberculosis patients by 2 to 3 
percent a year. 
  "The Health Ministry is in a position to guarantee both 
diagnosis and treatment of all patients," he noted. 
  He underscored the major gains that have been made in the 
battle against this disease in light of economic conditions in 
the country. 
<H5>  Cholera Prevention Campaign </H5>
  As for the measures that the Health Ministry will take to 
prevent massive numbers of cholera cases, the minister reported 
that a series of publicity spots would soon be broadcast to 
remind people about how to prevent the disease. 
  "The mass media can do a great deal by urging people to wash 
their hands, boil drinking water, and cook foods thoroughly," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by M.K.: "Diphtheria Epidemic at Ouacif Described </F>
as `Not Alarming'"] 
  [Text] Diphtheria, one of the most highly contagious of all 
diseases, is resurfacing in spectacular fashion in a number of 
regions of the country. 
  Tizi Ouzou -- Ouacif has not escaped this terrible 
affliction. In the last 10 days, several cases have been 
diagnosed in the remote region of Tizi Ouzou. As of last 
Wednesday, the toll was one person dead and 11 hospitalized. The 
sudden resurgence of this disease, which everyone thought was 
eradicated forever, is due mainly to the inadequate coverage of 
the vaccination program in recent years, according to what we 
were told by various physicians. Mr. Semmoud, a physician and 
Ouacif's top health official, said the majority of individuals 
diagnosed with the disease fall in the 12-to-17-year-old age 
bracket, most of them in very poor condition, already sick or 
never vaccinated. To cope with any further escalation of the 
problem, a crisis cell was created to maintain a 24-hour watch 
on the situation. In that context, and because it was in Ouacif 
that diphtheria cases were first identified, personnel at the 
CEMs [Colleges of Intermediate Studies] and high schools of 
downtown Ouacif were vaccinated. Also, in each case diagnosed, 
everyone living in the household and immediate vicinity were 
examined. 
  For the moment, the situation is far from reaching alarming 
proportions. All the necessary equipment and personnel have been 
deployed to the scene, a fact that we were able to verify during 
our tour of Ouacif high school, where we noted a massive 
official presence. From the prevention standpoint, it is vital 
to understand that diphtheria is an infectious disease, 
transmitted orally, whose symptoms are inflammation and 
spasmodic constriction of the throat and high fever. Thus, 
citizens should consult a physician immediately at the onset of 
these symptoms. 
  Finally, it should be noted that this epidemic has also 
affected other parts of Tizi Ouzou, as well as several other 
wilayas.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Diphtheria Deaths Declining"] </F>
  [Text] Since September 1993, 391 suspected diphtheria 
victims have been hospitalized in the affected wilayas 
(Tizi-Ouzou, Ghardaia, Bouira, Ouargia, Tamanrasset, and 
El-Oued), according to officials in the Ministry of Health and 
Population Affairs. Of those cases, 115 have been confirmed, and 
31 of the victims have unfortunately died. 
  In almost half the cases, according to ministry sources, 
victims were between ages 10 and 20 and either not vaccinated at 
all or not fully vaccinated against the disease. The number of 
deaths, rather high at the outset, has declined considerably, 
and the situation is now under control, despite constraints 
related to the unavailability of large quantities of vaccine and 
antidiphtheria medicine. 
  At this point, with outbreaks confined to isolated cases and 
small-scale epidemic flare-ups, health authorities say the 
percentage of the populace enjoying vaccinal protection -- now 
that vaccination is mandatory -- is easily large enough to 
prevent outbreak of a major epidemic. 
  A recent nationwide assessment of the epidemiological 
situation for diphtheria showed that centers of contagion are 
still persisting, even increasing, in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, 
and there has been a major new outbreak in Ghardaia. However, 
diphtheria has died down at least temporarily in Bouira, 
Tamanrasset, El Oued, and Ouargia, the assessment showed. 
  In Ouargia the situation has been brought almost fully under 
control, and the isolation unit has closed down. In Tizi-Ouzou, 
all health sectors are affected, with a total of 87 reported 
cases, 34 of them bacteriologically confirmed, and six deaths. 
In the same wilaya, health officials have treated 46 healthy 
carriers identified by analysis of throat cultures. 
  In Ghardaia, 79 persons have been hospitalized with 49 cases 
confirmed, but there have been no deaths. Finally, the Ministry 
of Health and Population Affairs reiterates that the large-scale 
population movements seen in recent years across our borders, 
especially in the south, have contributed to propagation of the 
infection and were probably responsible for the virulent form it 
assumed when the epidemic first broke out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Typhoid Reported in Sour </F>
El-Ghozlane"] 
  [Text] Forty-five (45) confirmed cases of typhoid have been 
reported in recent days at Sour El-Ghozlane (wilaya of Bouira), 
where the first case was identified on 20 December. 
  The number of persons under observation at the Sour 
El-Ghozlane hospital reportedly has reached 68, a majority of 
whom are adolescents. "Those infected were immediately put in 
isolation," say top local health officials, adding that "the 
prognosis for these patients is good." The health director and 
the head of the daira of Sour El-Ghozlane noted in that regard 
that "the appearance of this waterborne epidemic may be due to 
problems in the city's water treatment system." 
  Other sources point to the decrepit condition of pipes 
carrying waste water, which might have seeped into potable water 
conduits.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Typhoid Epidemic in Sour </F>
El-Ghozlane"] 
  [Text] A typhoid epidemic has been raging in Sour 
El-Ghozlane for more than a month. In this daira located in the 
wilaya of Bouira, 66 people suspected of being infected have 
been hospitalized, and 46 cases have been confirmed. 
  According to health officials, a water-line break between 
0900 and 1200 may have been responsible for the epidemic. The 
rupture is believed to have allowed waste water to seep into 
potable water conduits. 
  Dr. Ouahdi, head of the national program to combat 
waterborne 
diseases, says the epidemic could have been avoided if local 
authorities had paid attention to warnings from daira health 
officials. 
  These reports noted problems in the potable water system. 
"Samples taken in various parts of the daira have shown the 
absence of chlorine. This proves that the potable water was not 
treated even [text missing] epidemic," our source said. 
  Readers are reminded that the same cause was cited as 
responsible for a similar epidemic in Guelma (196 cases) and 
Saida (104 cases) in July of last year. Tiaret reported 500 
cases of typhoid fever in the second half of 1993. To avert a 
pandemic, disease prevention officials in the Health Ministry 
are working in two ways to address problems in contaminated 
zones. The first line of action is long term and will involve 
renovation of pipes and improvement of chemical and 
bacteriological monitoring in the potable water treatment system. 
  The second, for immediate implementation, involves warning 
people in areas affected by the epidemic to take special hygiene 
precautions and augmenting chlorine levels in the water towers. 
  In the same context, the Health Ministry early this month 
created "an antidiphtheria operational group" headed by 
Professor Dif and consisting of the directors of various health 
agencies (INSP [National Public Health Institute], Pasteur 
Institute, ENAPHARM [National Pharmaceuticals Company], etc.). 
  By conducting regular briefings for the medical corps and 
local authorities in areas affected by the epidemic, the 
committee will promote wide dissemination of information about 
this contagious airborne epidemic and means of prevention. 
"There were some deaths when the epidemic first broke out, 
because doctors did not recognize the disease," said Professor 
Dif, director of the Health Ministry's prevention service. 
  The diphtheria epidemic seems to be almost completely under 
control now, with only two active centers of contagion 
presenting the risk of further infection: one at Tizi-Ouzou (87 
cases and six deaths) and the other at Ghardaia (79 cases but no 
deaths). In that connection, Professor Dif assures us that 
vaccination coverage will be provided. 
  "We do not, of course, have vaccines in the industrial 
quantities needed to conduct a nationwide vaccination campaign, 
but we are in a position to treat the epidemic now under way," 
he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Layla Marmush: "AL-MUSAWWAR in AIDS Ward in </F>
al-'Abbasiyah for the First Time; Number of People in Egypt Who 
Have AIDS Remains Unknown Even Though It's Been 8 Years Since 
Disease Was Discovered"] 
  [Text] This was a first for the Egyptian press and the Arab 
press. It was the first time we were able to go inside an AIDS 
ward and talk face to face with Egyptians who have AIDS. It was 
the first time we were able to hear their voices and take their 
pictures. We used to deal with them as though they were 
phantoms: we heard about them, but we did not see them. We 
watched them, but we kept our distance. 
  Now we are able to ask AIDS patients questions, and it is 
now 
possible for them to answer. We can take their pictures, but 
from behind, due to humanitarian, family, and social 
considerations. After all, society still rejects people who have 
AIDS and holds them responsible for their disease even though 
some AIDS patients have nothing to do with the fact that they 
contracted this disease. 
  Here is an account of the tour from the beginning. It is a 
tour of the unit where AIDS patients are treated. These 
patients, out of love and compassion, share a concern about not 
transmitting their disease to others that is greater than the 
physicians'. Nowhere else can one see human relationships like 
those we saw in that unit between the people who work in it and 
their patients. 
  Let us start with the picture in the heart of Egypt. We are 
told every year that the figures that tell us how many people 
have AIDS are estimates, and we are also told that the sample is 
a random sample. This then is the question, and it is also the 
issue: When will we know precisely the number of Egyptians who 
have AIDS? 
  The only center in Cairo that provides dialysis services to 
patients who have kidney disease and who also have the AIDS 
virus is located in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital. Service at 
that center started in November 1990 with six machines serving 
22 patients, including seven women. Three of those women and 
eight men have died. The cause of death was kidney failure and 
not infection with the AIDS virus. 
  And even this week the center, which is staffed by two 
specialists, seven interns, and 12 female nurses is offering its 
services to 21 patients, including six women. 
  [We met] two patients the moment we entered the unit. One of 
them was a 53-year old farmer from Suez. That man, who is 
married and is the father of six children, two of them girls, 
was referred to the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah by the 
medical commission in Suez. Because he is the only dialysis 
patient in the governorate who has the virus, it would not be 
possible to designate a dialysis machine in his governorate for 
his exclusive use. He endures the commute to Cairo twice a week 
to undergo dialysis at the al-'Abbasiyah unit. 
  A decree from the Ministry of Health requires that every 
governorate that has a number of patients who suffer from kidney 
disease and who are HIV positive set aside a certain number of 
dialysis machines for the use of those individuals. If, however, 
a governorate has no more than one or two such patients, they 
would be referred to the closest dialysis center treating 
similar patients in another governorate. 
  The patient from Suez does not know how he became infected 
with the AIDS virus. 
  The second patient was a 45-year old unemployed woman who is 
the mother of two daughters and two sons. She too does not know 
how she became infected. This woman who has kidney disease and 
undergoes dialysis at the dialysis unit in al-'Abbasiyah, 
infected her husband whose infection was discovered when samples 
were taken from him and tested in one of the tests that are 
conducted periodically on those who have contact with HIV 
positive patients. 
  The female nurse who watches the dialysis machine is wearing 
medical gloves. Her face is covered with a mask, and her hair is 
covered with a sterilized cap. She is wearing an apron to 
protect her chest, and she is also wearing disposable shoes, 
which are worn only once. Anyone entering the unit has to be 
wearing protective clothing similar to that which she is 
wearing. Fear of AIDS, however, is not the reason for that. 
Protective clothing is required for those who work with dialysis 
patients to prevent contamination. These articles of clothing 
are destroyed as soon as one exits the unit. 
  I asked the nurse, "Aren't you afraid of becoming infected?" 
The immediate reply coming from the nurse who declined to 
mention her name or have her picture taken was this: "The 
patients are more careful than we are about not infecting us 
because they are certain that if there is a single case of 
infection in anyone working in the unit, everyone will stay away 
and no one will have anything to do with them." 
  Dr. Khalid Salamah, a dialysis specialist, interjected, 
"Samples are taken periodically from physicians and nurses who 
have contact with the patients to ascertain that they are not 
infected. The real problem does not lie in the contact we have 
with the patients in the unit, but it lies with the patients 
having to face other people. 
  "For example, the surgeon who receives a certain fee for the 
permanent incision he makes in a dialysis patient asks for 
thousands of pounds when he knows that the patient has AIDS. 
  "Also, if a patient outside the unit has to see a dentist, 
he 
hesitates to tell that dentist about his disease, and he waits 
until he comes to us. Some of those patients will see a 
physician because of persistent pain, but they don't tell that 
physician about their infection. The burden then falls on 
physicians who must be cautious and careful in dealing with all 
patients. They must continuously sterilize all the equipment and 
tools they use to protect themselves and their patients from the 
possibility of infection." 
  We asked Dr. Qadri 'Imarah, director of al-'Abbasiyah 
Hummiyat Hospital, about the procedure that would be followed 
with a person who is found to have the AIDS virus. Dr. 'Imarah 
said, "If infection with the virus is confirmed, the infected 
person registers his name in the Health Office of his 
governorate. The patient is monitored, and his condition is 
checked every three months. The Communicable Diseases Section of 
the Health Department offers health awareness and education 
services to the patient and his family and to those who have 
contact with him. The symptoms of immune deficiency disease do 
not usually become evident in a person who has the virus until 
some time after he is infected. And that period of time is 
determined by the ability of that person's immune system to 
resist infection. When that person's resistance fails, his 
condition deteriorates, and it becomes incumbent upon him to go 
to the Hummiyat Hospital for assistance. 
  "In previous years fear of infection among workers in any 
hospital admitting such patients was so strong, it approached 
terror. Now, however, the situation is different. As more 
information about the virus became available through scientific 
advances, those working with patients whose disease is advanced 
have become more careful and more relaxed. This is because the 
Ministry of Health has sent people abroad for training on how to 
work with AIDS patients. The ministry also holds courses for 
those who work in the field of communicable diseases." 
  Dr. 'Imarah then added, "The first case of AIDS in Egypt was 
discovered in November 1986, and the patient, who was a 
foreigner, was isolated in al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital and 
then deported to his country. There were also three childbirth 
procedures for three women who had the virus. These were 
accompanied by considerable turmoil, because physicians and 
nurses were fearful about becoming infected as a result of their 
involvement in those procedures. 
  "In the past we used to destroy everything that was used by 
patients, and we used to disinfect the entire room because we 
did not know for sure how the disease was transmitted. The unit 
where patients were kept in isolation used to be treated as 
though it were an awful place. Now, however, patients are not 
kept in total isolation. They are monitored, and they are not 
isolated unless their health deteriorates and they require total 
supervision. In most cases patients die in the hospital." 
  I asked the director of al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital 
about 
the patients. I asked him what kind of people they were and what 
were their occupations. 
  He replied, "Most of them were employed abroad. Some of them 
underwent surgical procedures that required blood transfusions, 
and the blood they received was contaminated. The rest became 
infected as a result of having multiple sexual partners and 
using contaminated syringes for drug use. 
  "These people are sailors, pilots, and employees of travel 
bureaus who have contact with groups of tourists. 
  "The most recent hospital death of an AIDS patient was that 
of a sailboat owner who operated his sailboat on the Nile. This 
man had sexual relations with female tourists." 
  AL-MUSAWWAR: Do you have an AIDS patient who is 
being detained in the hospital at the present time? 
  Dr. 'Imarah said, "We have an Italian national who is in 
custody pending a court case. We asked that he be isolated so 
that those who have contact with him in detention do not become 
exposed to infection." 
<H5>  AIDS in Egypt </H5>
  We leave al-'Abbasiyah Hummiyat Hospital, which is 
considered 
a model hospital for the treatment of AIDS patients, to explore 
where else the disease can be found in Egypt. 
  The first AIDS case in Egypt was discovered in November 
1986. 
Since then the national program to fight AIDS has been operating 
in conjunction with the World Health Organization [WHO]. By the 
end of 1987 there were five cases of AIDS in Egypt: four were 
Egyptians and one was a foreigner. Other AIDS cases were 
subsequently found, and eventually the number of cases rose to 
68. In 1990 some of those patients became symptomatic. 
  By the end of last October the total number of persons who 
were found to have the AIDS virus and to have full-blown AIDS 
had amounted to 313 Egyptians: 150 of them died. The number of 
foreigners who were found to have the disease was 210, and they 
were returned to their countries. 
  Dr. Muhammad Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim, first undersecretary 
minister for preventive medicine at the Ministry of Health, 
said, "All the Egyptians who have the virus became infected 
while they were abroad. They were infected by receiving 
contaminated blood after a surgical procedure or by having sex 
with a sexual partner who had the virus. There are exceptions to 
this generalization. There are some singular cases like, for 
example, that of the young woman from Dikirnis who unwittingly 
married a man who knew he had the AIDS virus. In that case the 
woman and her fetus became infected. 
  "There is also the al-Gharbiyah man with kidney disease who 
used to undergo dialysis without knowing that he was infected 
with the virus. Negligence at the center where he was receiving 
the dialysis treatment was responsible for infecting 30 persons. 
  "Dialysis centers have been given strict instructions to 
examine patients and to ascertain that they have no infectious 
diseases before placing them on dialysis machines. Another basic 
rule also has to do with the machine, which must be sterilized, 
and as a preventive measure, the filter must be changed after 
each patient so that the safety of its use can be completely 
assured. Health departments check on dialysis patients every 
three months to ascertain that they are free of the virus. We 
are the ones who found the virus in the al-Gharbiyah patient in 
the course of conducting this periodic testing on patients." 
  He added, "Several locations in the various governorates 
have 
been designated for monitoring the disease among those groups 
that are most vulnerable to infection, most importantly, the 
people who have venereal disease, drug addicts, prison inmates, 
pregnant women, foreigners residing in Egypt, people who are 
employed in the field of tourism, people who have blood 
diseases, and prostitutes. By 1992 the total number of blood 
samples drawn from these groups and tested came to approximately 
365,577. The total number of cases found to be positive was 48." 
  AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to the blood bags, is 
each bag tested to ascertain that the blood in the bag is virus 
free?" 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim said, "The ministry supplied 213 blood 
banks -- these are main as well as branch offices -- with the 
necessary equipment for testing blood bags for possible 
contamination with the AIDS virus, hepatitis, and also syphilis. 
More than 939,000 bags have been tested since 1986. In addition, 
the ministry has oversight authority over all the blood banks. 
And we would not think twice about shutting down any blood bank 
that does not follow instructions." 
  AL-MUSAWWAR: How old were those Egyptians who are 
carrying the virus when they became infected? 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "Most people who carry the AIDS 
virus are between the ages of 15 and 40 years. They represent 61 
percent of AIDS patients. There are eight people who have the 
virus who are under 15 years old. They were being treated for 
their blood diseases, and they were being given the eighth 
coefficient [as published] that we used to import before 1986. 
They represent 2.6 percent of the total number of AIDS cases, 81 
percent of which are male, and 19 percent are female." 
  Dr. Subhi 'Abd-al-Rahim had this to say about the ministry's 
role in protecting citizens from infection with the AIDS virus: 
"We are trying to spread health awareness among all groups of 
citizens. We want them to know how they might become infected so 
they can avoid infection. In addition, we are monitoring the 
spread of the disease, ensuring the safety of the blood supply, 
and using disposable plastic syringes when immunizing people. 
  "Educating people about how infection is transmitted is the 
most that the ministry can do. AIDS is a disease that afflicts a 
healthy person who willfully fails to avoid the poor conduct 
that results in his infection. AIDS is a disease that no one can 
get in spite of himself." 
<H5>  Foreigners </H5>
  AL-MUSAWWAR: With regard to foreigners in Egypt, 
how do you ascertain that they do not have AIDS? 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim replied, "A foreigner who comes to Egypt 
[and intends] to stay for several months or longer to study or 
to work is not given a work permit or a residence permit until 
he has been examined and a clean bill of health is issued to him 
by the central laboratories of the Ministry of Health. 
  "With regard to transit tourists, however, no one has the 
right to examine them to ascertain that they are free of the 
virus. Their temporary residence does not pose a threat because 
the disease can only be transmitted through blood or sexual 
intercourse." 
  In order to have the full picture about AIDS, one would 
naturally take a look at what is happening with AIDS in the 
world around us and also in the East Mediterranean, the area set 
off by the WHO. 
  The WHO estimates that more than 10 million adults and 
children worldwide have been infected with the AIDS virus since 
it was first discovered. Approximately two million persons are 
now in an advanced stage of the disease, which starts, on the 
average, 10 years after a person is infected with the virus for 
the first time. 
  The organization estimates that the total number of men, 
women, and children infected with the AIDS virus by the year 
2000 will be between 30 and 40 million persons. Between 12 and 
18 million persons will have full-blown AIDS by then, and 
approximately 90 percent of the people who are expected to 
become infected with the AIDS virus during this decade will be 
in developing countries. 
  The WHO expects developing countries to suffer more from the 
spread of this disease because the supreme political authorities 
in those countries do not provide adequate support for the 
efforts that are necessary to prevent this disease and to fight 
against it. 
  There are also other fundamental obstacles to the effective 
prevention of this disease. There is, for example, ignorance 
about the nature of the disease, and there is denial that a 
relationship exists between AIDS, on the one hand, and an 
individual or society, on the other. Another obstacle is the 
failure to deal seriously with the disease or the inability to 
do something about its enormously catastrophic nature. Other 
obstacles include the low social and economic status of women, 
the traditional and cultural practices that make transmittal of 
the disease easier, and the avoidance of informed and frank 
discussions about sexual matters. 
  Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Wahdan, director of prevention at WHO's 
East Mediterranean regional office, said, "Incontrovertible 
evidence has proved that the AIDS virus is transmitted basically 
through the vehicle of individual conduct. In some societies 
risky factors and practices are widespread, quite openly. People 
do not think twice about engaging in such practices, and they do 
very little to prevent them. In such cases society has to play a 
significant role, and it has to intervene if it really wants to 
protect individuals' health as well as public health from an 
AIDS invasion. In other societies where risky factors and 
practices are rejected outright by society, these factors and 
practices take place in secret, and governments cannot do much 
to affect them. It is in those instances that the role of 
society becomes important: to confront what is being done in 
secret and to discuss it candidly and unequivocally. 
<H5>  The Features of the Epidemic </H5>
  The WHO identifies the features of the AIDS epidemic in the 
East Mediterranean region. The most important of them are: 

  -  Infection came into the region late. At first people 
became infected by imported blood or as a result of sexual 
intercourse with persons from areas where the virus was 
widespread. 
  -  Prostitution is illegal [in the region], but it is secretly 
practiced even though the extent to which it is being practiced 
is not known. 
  -  The extent to which drugs are administered by injection is 
not 
known, but the problem is not a simple one. 
  -  These countries attach significant importance to the ethical 
values that are imposed by religion and society. 

    By September 1992 the total number of cases reported [to the 
WHO] from 20 countries in the East Mediterranean region had 
amounted to 1,399. In addition, there were 308 cases of 
illnesses that occur with AIDS and are associated with it, and 
there were 4,641 cases of people who had been infected with the 
AIDS virus but who had not shown symptoms of the disease. 
  It is estimated, however, that the real number of cases 
exceeds these figures, because in many countries diagnosis 
remains inadequate and cases are under-reported. The East 
Mediterranean region is an area that extends from the Maghreb 
[to the west of that region] all the way to Afghanistan in the 
east. 
  Seventy-five percent of those who have AIDS are male, and 25 
percent are female. The age group that has the highest number of 
reported cases is that group that is between the ages of 30 and 
39. Those between the ages of 20 and 29 are the group with the 
second highest number of reported cases. That is followed by the 
group that is made up of those between the ages of 15 and 19. 
Almost nine-tenths of the cases occurred among those who are 
between 15 and 39 years old. 
  Sexual intercourse is the leading way of transmitting the 
virus. It is the cause of infection in about 77 percent of 
reported cases. Whereas heterosexual sex, which is the prevalent 
form of sex, accounted for 69 percent of those cases, it was 
also noticed that homosexual relationships accounted for eight 
percent of the sexually transmitted cases of the disease. Blood 
transfusions and blood products accounted for 15 percent of the 
cases; intravenous drug use accounted for six percent; and 
finally, two percent of AIDS cases became infected during 
childbirth. 
<H5>  Sex Education </H5>
  If these are the most important characteristics of how AIDS 
was spread worldwide and in the East Mediterranean region, what 
might be the true picture of how the disease was spread in 
Egypt, which is located in the heart of the Middle East? Do we 
have a civilized, scientific approach for dealing with this 
danger that is coming our way? Is our approach based on 
confronting the facts and acting on the basis of those facts, or 
are we burying our heads in the sand in an attempt to escape and 
delay the danger? 
  WHO figures indicate that sexual activity is one of the 
leading causes of infection with the AIDS virus in the East 
Mediterranean region. It is the cause of infection in 77 percent 
of all cases. People who are uptight will undoubtedly speak up 
here and declare that homosexual activity, which is the main 
cause of infection, is prohibited by our religion. 
Unfortunately, however, sexual activity among homosexuals 
accounts for no more than eight percent of the cases of 
infection, whereas normal sexual activity accounts for 69 
percent of all cases of infection with the disease. 
  It is that which is making sexual conduct the focus of 
direct 
attention. That is where the emphasis must be placed to stop the 
infection with the disease. This can be done by devoting 
attention to the fact that all young people have to be educated. 
A scientific program to teach sex [in school] during the 
preparatory stage of education has to be devised. Sex is to be 
taught in a simple manner that would be compatible with the 
students' ability to absorb and understand. The religious and 
spiritual sides of these young people is also to be nurtured. In 
addition, emphasis must be placed on men and women abstaining 
from illegitimate sexual relationships that would expose both 
husbands and wives to the risk of infection. 
  The responsibility of implementing this role does not rest 
solely on the shoulders of the Ministry of Health. It rather 
falls on everybody's shoulders: physicians, people in the media, 
teachers, scientists, and clergymen. Everyone in society has to 
take part in an informed, educational campaign that would be 
based on clarity, candor, and disclosure of the facts. This is 
especially important given the fact that the man who is 
responsible for the health of all Egyptians proclaims the notion 
that the credibility of any official is determined by that 
official's knowledge of the truth and [the extent to which] he 
proclaims it. 
  Dr. 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fattah, the minister of health said, "It 
has 
been proved that the AIDS virus is spreading. People have to be 
made aware of the need for abstinence and the need to adhere to 
proper, moral conduct so that disease can be avoided. We have to 
call attention to the fact that there are AIDS cases in Egypt. 
At the same time, we have to give people adequate instructions 
so they can avoid infection. It is up to each AIDS patient to 
fear God and to tell his physicians about his disease so as not 
to infect others."

  [Text] Kanpur, December 6 (PTI) -- A total of 336 
full-blown AIDS cases were detected, while over one lakh people 
were found infected by the AIDS virus in India till June 1993, 
experts at a synposium on different aspects of AIDS, said here 
on Saturday. 
  Speaking at the symposium, Dr. R.K. Gupta, professor and 
head 
of the department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM) of the 
Medical College here, said two-thirds of the HIV infections were 
due to heterosexual transmission and would cross 75 to 80 
percent by year 2000. 
  He said the first case of AIDS was reported in the United 
States in 1981 and Thailand in 1985. The number of HIV infected 
cases in mid-1992 throughout the world were 277,042 in American 
region, 151,455 in African region and 426 in Southeast Asia 
region. 
  Thailand leads with 1,589 cases of reported AIDS while the 
lone case of AIDS was reported in Bangladesh. India figures at 
number two position with 336 cases followed by Myanmar 47, 
Indonesia 31, Sri Lanka 24, and Nepal 18. 
  Dr. Gupta said approximately one out of three children born 
of HIV affected women acquire the infection and later die of 
AIDS usually before five years of age. 
  Dr. Gupta said in India AIDS was more common among males 
than 
the females. 
  Highlighting the methods of transmission of the virus 
through 
sexual intercourse, sharing of syringes and needles, transfusion 
of infected blood and from mother to baby during pregnancy, 
assistant professor, Dr. G.C. Sexana said the disease was not 
transmitted by normal social activities which includes shaking 
hands, hugging, eating outside, using the same toilet or clothes.

<F P=106> [Article: "States Urged To Use AIDS Funds"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): The Centre has expressed 
serious concern over the under-utilisation of its funds by state 
governments for prevention and control of AIDS. 
  The states have been directed to ensure timely and optimal 
use of funds being released to them under the national AIDS 
control programme. 
  The directive was issued at a meeting of state health 
secretaries and AIDS control programme officers which ended here 
yesterday. 
  Briefing journalists here today, the chairperson of the 
national AIDS control organisation, Mr. P.R. Das Gupta, said the 
meeting reviewed the scheme for prevention of infection 
resulting in AIDS and strengthening the blood bank system in the 
country. 
  He said AIDS victims in the country numbered 506 Indians 
(389 
males and 117 females) and 16 foreigners (12 males and four 
females), as on November 30, 1993. 
  The probable sources of infection in Indians, he said, 
included heterosexual promiscuousity, blood transfusion, blood 
product infusion, homosexual contact, intravenous drug addicts 
and spouse of AIDS patients. 
  Mr. Gupta said the meeting also reviewed the progress under 
the scheme for involvement of voluntary organisations in the 
national AIDS control programme. 
  It stressed on more effective measures to promote awareness 
among the people through a comprehensive education and 
communication strategy.

<F P=106> [Article: "State Warned of HIV Epidemic"] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, January 9 -- Bombay had become a major 
epicentre for the spread of HIV infection accounting for 
one-third of the total AIDS cases in the country, warned Dr. 
Michael Mersen, chief, Global Programme on AIDS, WHO, Geneva, 
here yesterday. 
  To prevent a major epidemic with tragic consequences, the 
potential disaster must be treated with the same urgency and 
priority as the recent earthquake in the state, he urged. 
  Dr. Mersen was delivering the keynote address at the first 
international conference on HIV/AIDS infection, tuberculosis and 
respiratory diseases, organised by the National Medical 
Association for AIDS Control, the Environment Medical 
Association of India and the Indian Academy of Health Education. 
  He noted that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was bringing along with 
it a great increase in tuberculosis and, by the WHO estimates, 
the number of new TB cases each year worldwide were said to rise 
from 7.5 million in 1990 (with 2.1 million in India) to 12 
million in 2005, part of the rise being due to the HIV epidemic. 
  Between 1990 and 1999, eight million people are expected to 
have developed TB as a consequence of their HIV infection and 
will go on to infect more people with TB than HIV. 
  Dr. Mersen expressed alarm as Asia following the path of 
Africa where the annual number of reported TB cases had almost 
tripled in the last five years. He said that an estimated one 
billion people in Asia were latently infected with tubercle 
bacilli. 
  Already in India, more than 11 percent of reported TB 
patients in Manipur were HIV positive and at Bombay's JJ 
Hospital, HIV prevalence had risen from 2 percent in 1989 to 11 
percent this year. Sixty percent of AIDS patients in the country 
had TB. 
  To combat this dual infection, the prevention of HIV 
infection and the strengthening of TB control programmes, 
accelerating efforts to interrupt TB transmission by the 
curative treatment of TB cases had preventive therapy to stop 
HIV-infected people from developing TB are suggested by Dr. 
Mersen. 
  He said that HIV infection could be prevented by taking into 
account the roots of transmission, namely contaminated needles 
when injecting drugs, inflected blood transfusion and unsafe sex 
practices. 
  He advocated the widespread use of condoms and better 
prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) 
  WHO estimates that the number of HIV infections in South and 
South-east Asia rose from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this past 
year and more than two in five of those infected were women. 
  In India the estimated number of HIV infections has risen by 
60 percent over the past year to around 1.6 million. 
  Only a small number of Asians infected with HIV so far, 
around 75,000, had gone on to develop AIDS, said Dr. Mersen. He 
cautioned that the recent surge in the number of infections 
would be followed by a dramatic rise in AIDS cases in the next 
five years. 
  By the year 2000, as many as 500,000 Asians are expected to 
develop AIDS annually. 
  Sex education in schools was crucial, Dr. Mersen said. 
  STD's must not only be treated at STD clinics which spell 
out 
stigmatisation to the patient but at every health centre. 
Clients of prostitutes need to be educated. 
  For the treatment of STD's WHO recommends a simplified 
approach which does not require laboratory facilities. A mere 
physical examination and history-taking were sufficient, he 
said. Model treatment charge and training courses by WHO were 
being developed to help governments ensure widespread 
application of this simplified approach. 
  Dr. S.P. Tripathi, director of the Indian Council of Medical 
Research, said all programmes for the control of TB and HIV were 
likely to be vitiated with the combined impact of these 
diseases. He feared the spread of multi-drug resistant strains 
in the country. 
  Mr. Paban Singh Ghatowar, Union deputy minister of health 
and 
family welfare, who was the chief guest, admitted that in view 
of the alarming trends, HIV infection was now regarded as a 
development problem in India. 
  Dr. S.R. Sallunkhe, additional director, health services, 
government of Maharashtra, said that of the 184,000 people 
screened in the state, 70 out of 1,000 were found HIV positive 
and 200 of the 238 cases in Maharashtra were from Bombay. The 
total number of AIDS cases in the country was a little over 500.

<F P=106> [Article by Namita Devidayal: "Malaria Returns With a </F>
Vengeance"] 
  [Excerpt] Bombay, December 22 -- Lady Anopheles is back 
with a vengeance. The dreaded mosquito that plays hostess to the 
malaria parasite has left behind a toll of over 20,000 cases in 
Bombay this year. 
  But city doctors are particularly alarmed about the growing 
incidence of falciparum, commonly known as cerebral malaria, 
which can be fatal if not detected early enough. While the 
Bombay municipal corporation (BMC) claims that there have been 
2,400 cases and 14 deaths, doctors point out that many more 
deaths remain unreported. 
  "Ten years ago malaria hardly ever necessitated a hospital 
admission," says Dr. Zarir Udwadia, who is affiliated to the 
Hinduja and Parsi General Hospitals. "Today I get one to two 
cases of falciparum in a week." 
  Over the last few years, two things have happened. First, 
the 
mosquito of this particular strain has grown resistant to 
insecticides like DDT. Second, the parasite has developed an 
immunity to chloroquine, which is the most widely-prescribed and 
cheapest drug used to cure malaria.

  [Text] Berhampur, December 6 -- An unidentified disease has 
claimed 25 lives during the past 30 days in Ramgiri village of 
Gajapati district in Orissa. A 40-year-old man died of the 
disease recently. 
  The symptoms of the disease which has claimed victims in the 
age-group of four to 50 years, includes mild fever and loose 
motion. 
  Lack of adequate staff at the only health centre here has 
deprived the villagers of medical aid and they are forced to 
rely on quacks. 
  Many of the better-off Villagers have deserted their homes 
fearing the disease, which is suspected to be meningitis. 
  Meanwhile, some 10 persons have reportedly died of dysentry 
in the nearby-Parlakhemeundi town recently. Official sources, 
however, put the death toll at two. Some 200 persons, including 
children, are said to have been affected.

  [Text] Surat, December 14 -- With the Surat municipal 
corporation having failed to control the spread of jaundice, the 
entire city has been declared "jaundiced-threatened" and nearly 
half of the city has been declared jaundice-affected. 
  The Surat district collector, Mr. P.V. Trivedi, issued a 
special notification to the effect late last night under the 
Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987, on the advice of the Surat 
municipal commissioner, Mr. Balwant Singh. 
  Four wards of the city covering different areas namely 
Rander, Sagrampura, Salabutpura, Inderpura, Navapura, Begumpura, 
Zanpa Bazaar, Rustompura and Gopi Talao, have been declared 
jaundice-affected. 
  Over 464 cases of jaundice have been detected from these 
areas, according to official figures, but the unofficial figure 
is feared to be around 600. About three deaths have been 
reported from the city which, however, do not have any official 
confirmation. 
  With each passing day, the number of jaundice cases have 
been 
increasing and the city's hospitals are flooded with jaundice 
patients. On Monday alone, 13 cases were detected from Randar, 
eight from Sagrampura, five from Salabatpura and two cases from 
the Lambe Hanuman Road area. 
  A total of 118 jaundice patients are undergoing treatment at 
the infectious diseases hospital in the city. 
  The civic authorities have swooped down on a number of 
hotels, canteens and restaurants and ordered their closure 
following the detection of contaminated water being supplied to 
the consumers. 
  It was reported that highly unhygienic conditions prevailed 
at the 2.5 million gallon water storage tank at Umarwada, the 
principal source of water supply to the jaundice-affected areas, 
with people found bathing at the tank, washing clothes and even 
using the area around it as an open toilet.

  [Editorial Report] Recent Russian-language press articles 
reporting the present state of AIDS prevention and control in 
former Soviet republics are listed in this report. 
  The independent multinational physicians' newspaper 
MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA has devoted an entire issue to World AIDS 
Control Day (1 December 93). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 December 
93) ran six articles on AIDS on its second page the same day. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY, LESNAYA GAZETA and other newspapers have also 
recently published articles on AIDS developments. Key 
information from these articles is summarized below by republic. 
<H6>  Russian Federation </H6>
<H5>  Draft Legislation To be Reviewed </H5>
  New draft legislation on AIDS, which was previously 
considered by the Russian Supreme Soviet, has been included in a 
package of priority items for the Duma. In a second-page 
article, Professor V. V. Pokrovskiy speculates that adoption of 
the bill may result in abandonment of mass compulsory AIDS 
testing in favor of voluntary testing and public education on 
safe sex practices. 
  Pokrovskiy feels that the territorial centers' role in AIDS 
control is growing as a result of the increasing economic and 
political role of the krays, oblasts, and republics which fund 
them. By contrast, the only part of the extensive 1993 federal 
AIDS program that was actually funded was the federal purchase 
of test systems for territories. Pokrovskiy thinks that the 
federal government may not fund the program at all in 1994-95. 
  Other problems affecting the Russian AIDS control program, 
according to Pokrovskiy, are the failure of the AIDS centers to 
focus on prevention of sexual transmission of AIDS and the 
failure to allocate manpower and organize AIDS control 
institutions where the incidence is greatest (Moscow 
MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
<H5>  HIV Incidence </H5>
  The number of Russian HIV carriers began to increase rapidly 
in 1993. Eighty new HIV carriers were identified, and 32 
HIV-positive patients developed AIDS. Of the 692 HIV carriers 
detected in Russia, 124 are AIDS patients, 96 have died, and 435 
are foreigners and have been deported (Moscow IZVESTIYA 3 Dec 
93). The average age of the AIDS patients was 28, and the ratio 
of men to women was 8 to 1. Two of the HIV-infected were donors 
(Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93). 
  According to Vadim Pokrovskiy, director of the Russian 
Center 
for AIDS Prevention and Control, the pattern of HIV transmission 
in Russia has changed. Starting in 1990 HIV has spread 
predominantly among Russian homosexuals and to some extent among 
intravenous drug users. Initially, the virus was spread 
primarily by foreigners or through medical negligence. 
Pokrovskiy predicts a sharp rise in incidence among drug users 
within the next two years (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93). 
  A front-page column in MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA lists the 
incidence of HIV carriers by city and oblast. Moscow leads with 
125, 70 percent of whom are male homosexuals. Following it are 
three localities where the infected are primarily victims of 
medical negligence in 1988-89: Rostov Oblast with 109 carriers, 
Kalmykia with 98 and Volgograd Oblast with 72. HIV was sexually 
transmitted to most of the 59 St. Petersburg and 33 Moscow 
Oblast patients. Twenty territories have no identified AIDS 
carriers and the rest have a few each (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA 
GAZETA l Dec 93). 
<H5>  Testing </H5>
  Twenty-five million people were tested for AIDS in Russia 
during 1992, 21 million in 1993 (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 
93, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 Dec 93). For initial screening, 
laboratories use domestically produced test systems, which are 
less reliable than foreign systems. Specimens that test 
positive are sent to the Russian Scientific Methodological 
Center for AIDS Control, where foreign test systems and computer 
analysis are used to confirm the diagnosis. Positive results at 
this stage are retested and then confirmed by immune blotting 
(Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 8 Jun 93). 
<H5>  Russian Azidothymidine </H5>
  Domestically produced azidothymidine has been tested and 
evaluated as equal in quality to the English version of the drug 
(Moscow KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 DEC 93). 
<H5>  AIDS Database </H5>

  The Volgograd AIDS Prevention and Control Center, in 
collaboration with the Volgograd Medical Institute, has created 
a screening program for analyzing test results. The system, 
which includes a database on patients screened for AIDS starting 
in 1990, makes it possible to determine the extent to which a 
risk group has been screened. A supplementary program analyzes 
the effect of therapies on individual patients. The programs 
have been placed under the control of the municipal public 
health committee (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
<H5>  AIDS Education </H5>
  The periodical OGONEK, television company VID, and the 
OGONEK- ViD-AntiSPID [Anti-AIDS] charitable fund are jointly 
sponsoring the first international competition for films on 
AIDS. During the year-long contest, documentary, educational 
and dramatic films on AIDS will be broadcast weekly on the 
Ostankino channel (Moscow LESNAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93). On 1 
December in Moscow, the charitable All- Russian AIDS Control 
Association and Russian Ministry of Health jointly produced a 
benefit program including meetings with physicians and 
distribution of literature (Moscow MEDlTSlNSKAYA GAZETA l Dec 
93). 
<H6>  KAZAKHSTAN </H6>
  Galiya Sheriyazdanova, director of the Kazakhstan AIDS 
Prevention and Control Dispensary in Almaty, believes that AIDS 
screening of Kazakhstan residents may be unreliable. As the 
result of environmentally caused depression of their immune 
systems, they produce few antibodies when exposed to the human 
immunodeficiency virus, causing false negative test results 
(Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
  Press figures on HIV incidence in Kazakhstan are 
inconsistent. MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA (1 Dec 93) reported that only 
one HIV carrier had been detected, but the Almaty newspaper 
KARAVAN reported a total of 9 registered HIV cases and one AIDS 
death (Moscow SELSKAYA ZHIZN 21 Jul 93). 
Few Kazakhstan residents seek AIDS testing. Only 411 patients 
requested screening in 10 months of 1993, despite a public 
education effort that establishes a monthly quota of lectures, 
seminars and published writings for AIDS center physicians 
(Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
<H6>  UZBEKISTAN </H6>
  Based on the results of an international symposium held in 
Tashkent, the World Health Organization is developing a program 
of assistance to Uzbekistan. WHO's representative at the 
symposium believes that Uzbekistan is capable of containing the 
spread of HIV (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
  Uzbekistan maintains a network of AIDS control institutions 
despite a low HIV infection rate. Testing of 11 million 
individuals detected 31 HIV carriers, including 24 foreigners, 
who were deported, and 7 citizens. There has been one AIDS 
death. The AIDS service consists of centers in Karakalpakistan, 
Tashkent, and all 12 oblasts; 90 diagnostic laboratories; and 
over 100 offices for anonymous treatment. Funding is received 
from a state interbranch program, although at least one oblast 
center has a commercial sponsor that funds building repair and 
medical supplies (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA 
GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
  According to Olim Yakubov, head of the republic's AIDS 
prevention and control center, the priorities of the Uzbekistan 
AIDS program are equipping AIDS centers and educating physicans 
and medical workers. Mass AIDS testing has been abandoned in 
favor of screening high-risk groups such as patients with 
venereal diseases, homosexuals, and drug addicts. In addition, 
all pregnant women and donors are tested. A key need is AIDS 
diagnostic systems and medical equipment, which are available in 
Uzbekistan on a barter basis only. Banking system problems and 
the introduction of a national currency have reduced the 
delivery of AIDS test systems to Uzbek AIDS Centers by 40 
percent. Needed supplies and equipment are not being sent from 
Russia or Ukraine because the payments are not being transmitted 
(Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93.) 
<H6>  UKRAINE </H6>
  AIDS is on the rise in Ukraine. From March to December 1993, 
29 new AIDS cases were detected, more than during the entire 
previous year. HIV incidence has increased from 4.4 per million 
in 1992 to 5.4 per million. One hundred forty one people are 
infected, and 8 adults and 4 children have died. The largest 
numbers of HIV carriers are found in Odessa Oblast, Kiev, 
Donetsk, and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts and in the Crimean Republic. 
The virus was sexually transmitted -- heterosexually in 76 
cases and homosexually in 16 (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 
93). These statistics may not include infected foreigners, since 
Ukrainian AIDS Committee chairman Matsuk reported a total of 303 
HIV carriers detected as of 1 January 1993, including 112 
Ukrainians and 191 foreigners (Kiev DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 5 Jun 
93). Ternopol epidemiologist Tamara Burtnyak considers 
weakening of immune systems by the Chernobyl nuclear accident to 
have increased Ukrainians' susceptibility to AIDS (Ternopol 
VILNE ZHYTTYA 26 Oct 93). Ukraine is pursuing a mass screening 
program, with 1.9 million examined every quarter (Moscow 
MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
  Ukraine's AIDS detection abilities have been enhanced by new 
developments. The Ukraine AIDS Committee has created a national 
reference laboratory for HIV infection and has developed a 
reference panel of positive sera to be used in evaluating the 
quality of imported test systems. The US firm Abbott is selling 
third-generation test systems and modern equipment to the Kiev 
Scientific Research Institute for Hematology and Blood 
Transfusion. Only two Ukrainian firms manufacture test systems, 
using raw materials imported from other former Soviet republics. 
Most medicines for HIV carriers and AIDS patients are obtained 
from abroad (Moscow MEDITSINSKAY GAZETA 1 Dec 93). 
  A KHRESHCHATYK article blames an outbreak of "`exotic' 
contagious diseases,'' including AIDS, on "the uncontrolled stay 
of foreigners in Kiev." Sixty-five of the 92 new AIDS cases in 
Kiev were aliens (Kiev KHRESHCHATYK 15 Dec 93). 
  Convicts incarcerated at the Interoblast Hospital of the 
Administration of Internal Affairs in Donetsk Oblast wrote an 
open letter to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 Dec 93), complaining of 
unsanitary conditions and poor treatment. They allege that they 
have not received necessary medications and have been refused 
treatment by the Ukrainian AIDS Center in Kiev. 
<H6>  BALTICS AND BELARUS </H6>
  Latvia reported 14 AIDS patients and 16 HIV-positive 
individuals (Riga Radio Riga Network 1 Dec 93). Belarus has 
recorded 98 cases of HIV infection, 69 of them in Minsk. 
One-fourth of the Belarusian HIV carriers have developed AIDS 
and 6 have died. There are an estimated 900-1200 HIV carriers 
in Minsk. Sexual transmission of the virus predominates (Minsk 
VECHERNIY MINSK 30 Nov 93). Lithuania has detected 19 HIV 
carriers ranging in age from 19 to 40 and including 14 
homosexual males and 1 woman. During the past year, Abbott test 
systems have been used in Lithuania to screen donor blood for 
HIV (Vilnius TIESA 3 Dec 93). 
<H6>  GEORGIA </H6>
  According to Tengiz Tsertsvadze, senior doctor at Republican 
AIDS and Immunodeficiency Center, Georgia has recorded 16 HIV 
carriers, 11 of them citizens of the republic. Drug addiction 
and the shortage of disposable syringes, medical equipment, and 
sterilizers are key factors promoting the spread of AIDS. 
Tsertsvadze predicts 20,000 cases by the year 2000 and several 
hundred thousand cases by 2010, unless radical action is taken. 
AIDS screening, which is voluntary, is down to one-quarter of 
the 1990 level because of the lack of money to purchase test 
kits. Consequently, AIDS statistics are probably understated, in 
Tsertsvadze's opinion (Tblisi NOVAYA GAZETA Nov 93).

  [Editorial Report] Following is a compilation of reports 
monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 21 to 27 February 
concerning outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items 
are listed by country and disease. The source follows each item. 
<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Tuberculosis -- "Tuberculosis is increasing at an alarming 
rate in Cuito. About 180 cases of the disease were recorded in 
the area between January and 20 February. Statistic figures 
issued yesterday by the Cuito Hospital laboratory state that the 
increase in the number of tuberculosis cases is due to the poor 
food conditions faced by the residents. In the same period, 143 
malaria cases were diagnosed, caused by the proliferation of 
mosquitoes which transmit the disease, resulting in a high 
number of deaths." (Luanda TPA Television Network in Portuguese 
1930 GMT 22 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Malaria -- "More than 220 people died of malaria in 
Inhambane 
Province in 1993, according to sources at the provincial health 
directorate. They added that the outbreak of the disease is due 
to rains which over the past few days have been falling 
regularly in that area, contributing to the proliferation of 
mosquitoes." (Maputo NOTICIAS in Portuguese 18 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Malaria -- "Ten thousand cases of malaria were reported in 
South Africa last year, the most since 1976. This has been 
disclosed in Durban by Dr. Brian Sharp of the Medical Research 
Council, who said that the increase was due to the growing 
resistance of the disease to anti-malarial drugs. The country's 
high-risk regions, he said, were Northern Natal and the Northern 
and Eastern Transvaal." (Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network 
in English 1100 GMT 25 Feb 94] 
  Diarrhea -- "Diarrhea has killed at least 15 people in the 
administrative area of (Nihana), in Nampula Province's Mecuburi 
District, between 13 and 20 February. The administrator for 
Mecuburi District disclosed that an epidemic of diarrhea has 
broken out in the area." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Portuguese 1030 GMT 26 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Swaziland </H5>
  AIDS -- Minister of Health Derek von Wissel told nurses to 
prepare to cope with a flood of AIDS patients during the next 
two years. Mr. von Wissel said it has been projected that about 
10,000 people in Swaziland will die of AIDS during that time. 
Speaking to graduating nurses, Mr. von Wissel said a survey had 
shown that in Swaziland one in every five people had the virus. 
He said the impending crisis would present hospitals with 
complex problems and will be making big demands on the Swazi 
medical profession. (Johannesburg Channel Africa Radio in 
English 1600 GMT 25 Feb 94)

  [Text] A programme to reduce the incidence of malaria to a 
level that will make it cease to be a public hazard is to be 
launched in the Central Region before the end of the year. 
  The immediate objectives of the control programme, among 
others include the reduction and prevention of mortality and 
foetal wastage in pregnant woman by 70 percent, mortality in 
infants and children by 60 percent, morbidity due to malaria in 
pregnant women, infants and school children by 60 percent, all 
in five years. 
  For the same period of five years, the control programme is 
expected to reduce fatality rate due to malaria by 80 percent in 
all health institutions in the Central Region and to reduce 
malaria transmission by 50 percent. 
  According to the Malaria Action Plan for the Central Region 
1993-1997, a copy of which is available to the GRAPHIC, the 
campaign will make anti-malaria drugs available and affordable 
to the general population and promote their rational use. 
  The programme will also ensure proper treatment of pregnant 
women as early as possible and make early diagnoses, prompt and 
adequate treatment of malaria cases at all health centres. 
  ``The control programme shall increase the awareness of the 
general population about the risk of malaria so as to promote 
community participation in malaria control activities in the 
context of Primary Health Care (PHC),'' states the action plan. 
  As part of the programme, the use of impregnated bed nets 
will be introduced to all second cycle boarding institutions in 
the region in 1994. The first phase of the programme will last 
for five years and the second segment will start after the first 
phase. 
  The control activities will start in all the 12 districts of 
the region simultaneously and each district will have an 
inter-sectoral committee to supervise the control programme. 
  The action plan prepared by Dr. Richard Y. Osei, Regional 
Director of Medical Services, therefore, expressed the hope that 
all communities will co-operate with the eradication team to 
achieve success. 
  In 1992, Cape Coast District recorded the highest malaria 
cases of 24,484 patients representing 23.10 percent of the total 
regional recording of 102,025 malaria cases. Awutu-Effutu-Senya 
district recorded the least cases of 3,010 or 2.1 percent of the 
regional recording.

  [Text] Guinea worm cases in the country reduced by 46 
percent between January and June, this year, as compared to 35 
percent reduction recorded for the same period in 1992. 
  During the first half of this year, a total of 13,966 guinea 
worm cases were reported throughout the country compared to 
25,966 cases reported during the same period last year. 
  This is contained in the July 1993 report of Global 2000 
Guinea Worm Project, a copy of which was made available to the 
GRAPHIC at Saltpond or Thursday after a workshop for 35 
guinea-worm eradication volunteers. 
  The report noted that with the possible exception of the 
Northern Region, the number of infested villages is sufficiently 
small enough that a monthly visit by the co-ordinators to each 
endemic village would ensure the adoption of preventive measures. 
  A supplementary report on the Central Region signed by Dr. 
Richard Yaw Osei, Regional Director of Health Services also 
stated that the region achieved 100 percent filter distribution 
to about 42,000 households in December last year. It stated a 
survey carried out in January this year indicated that 80 
percent of the population actually used the monofilterment 
filters but 20 percent were worn out due to vigorous washing. 
  It said 120 endemic communities have been supplied with 
potable water since 1989 while about 130 endemic communities 
have been earmarked for potable water by the end of 1993.

<F P=106> [From the "Listeners's Letterbox" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The first HIV-infection case 
in China was reported in 1985 in the country's eastern province 
of Zhejiang. Four children who had hemophilia contracted the 
HIV virus because of contaminated blood used in transfusions. 
The blood plasma was imported from abroad. The Chinese 
Government banned the import of plasma immediately after that 
case. Additional HIV infections were found among intravenous 
drug users in the southern border province of Yunnan in 1989. 
Since then, China has identified more than 1,150 cases of HIV 
carriers, and 19 people have become afflicted with full-blown 
AIDS. At present, 85 percent of those infected with the AIDS 
virus in China are intravenous drug users. The border area with 
Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia is the most infected area because of 
its long history of opium trade and drug abuse. This area is 
still backward economically and far from urban areas. 
Transportation is limited. Radio and television sets, which can 
be used to warn people about the dangers of contracting AIDS, 
are rare, and medical service is not always available. In 
addition, cultural habits are responsible for some of the 
infections, as the local Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups believe 
opium is a cure for headache and diarrhea. 
  Planting and processing opium is banned by the government, 
but it is difficult for the small police force in the area to 
eliminate the illegal practice when the villagers plant opium in 
very small fields in the dense forests. Another problem is the 
shortage of needles, forcing many of the drug users to share 
needles. This causes the disease to spread even faster. 
  The Chinese Government has set up a clinic in Yunnan to 
monitor AIDS cases and educate the public about the dangers. 
But getting the information out is very difficult. Zhu Wei is 
working as a researcher with the AIDS surveillance center under 
the China Academy of Preventive Medicine. He has worked with 
the local teams in Yunnan Province. 
  [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in 
Mandarin, fading into English translation] The local people 
know little about disease that is threatening their lives. When 
talking with them, we need interpreters in Dai and Jingpo 
languages, because these people do not speak Mandarin, and most 
of them do not know how to read and write. The only thing they 
care about seems to be drugs. Every year the AIDS surveillance 
center sends a number of researchers to Yunnan to help with the 
local work and get firsthand information. I went to Yunnan last 
year. A lot of local medical workers who know the languages and 
have knowledge of AIDS went to every family with us, explaining 
the fatal disease to them. We put up a poster warning about the 
danger of AIDS in the villages. We paid special attention to 
the families that already had AIDS patients or HIV carriers. We 
talked to the family members on how to protect themselves from 
being affected. And now and then, the local medical workers 
visit these families to see how things go on. [end recording] 
  Though drug users make up the majority of AIDS victims in 
China, they are not the most dangerous factors of the spreading 
of AIDS in the country. Medical experts say the most dangerous 
factor is promiscuous sexual activity. For more than three 
decades after the founding of the PRC, Chinese successfully 
protected themselves against venereal diseases. However, while 
the opening and reform programs that began in the 1980's have 
brought prosperity to the country, they have also caused 
dramatic changes in people's ideas about morality and sex. 
Cases of prostitution are increasingly rapidly every year. The 
number of people who have sexual partners outside marriage is 
increasing, and sexual activity among young people and teenagers 
is now occurring much earlier. The number of venereal disease 
cases has increased dramatically. In 1991, sexually 
transmission accounted for 10 percent of the total number of HIV 
cases. In 1992 it was 20 percent. The rate is still growing.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The incidence of 
epidemic diseases decreased steadily in 1993 in the capital city 
of Beijing. 
  Sources disclosed that in 1993 reported cases of contagious 
hepatitis A and B fell by 7.39 percent from that of 1992 and the 
spread of viral hepatitis remained low. 
  The hepatitis B vaccination rate went up during the year, to 
reach 92.80 percent among newborn babies. The hepatitis B 
surface antigen (hbsag) carrying rate was reduced to 0.41 
percent, 87.94 percent down from that over the period 1988-1990. 
  By July 1, 1993, no case of infantile paralysis caused by 
wild strains had been discovered. 
  The number of patients suffering from tuberculosis fell 7.17 
percent compared to 1992. 
  According to local officials, last year Beijing invested two 
million yuan to buy advanced equipment for epidemic prevention 
stations in districts or towns. A computer network has also 
been employed to enable quick reactions to epidemic diseases.

  [Text] Tokyo, Oct. 29 KYODO -- Myanmar's [Burma's] health 
minister on Friday [29 October] appreciated assistance from the 
Japanese private sector in combating the nation's growing AIDS 
problem, while noting the absence of official aid, Japanese 
Government officials said. 
  Rear Adm. Than Nyunt, who arrived Tuesday on a four-day 
unofficial visit, broached Myanmar's AIDS situation in a brief 
session of talks with Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, 
the officials said. 
  Than Nyunt told Ouchi that Myanmar is grateful for 
AIDS-testing devices donated by the private Japanese Foundation 
for AIDS Prevention. 
  The devices were donated last April during a visit to 
Myanmar 
by foundation leader Tatsuo Ozawa, a Shinseito member of the 
House of Representatives. 
  Than Nyunt said until Japan's 1988 suspension of official 
aid 
to Myanmar, the country received substantial medical assistance 
from Tokyo. Japan suspended aid along with many other countries 
after Myanmar's military suppression on a democracy movement. 
  Ouchi was quoted as saying Japan is very concerned about the 
AIDS problem in southeast Asia from a humanitarian point of 
view. But he did not offer any concrete support for Myanmar's 
AIDS prevention program, they said. 
  A recent World Health Organization interim report said that 
by last June, Myanmar had only reported 47 AIDS cases. But 
Japanese officials said the actual situation is no doubt 
considerably worse. 
  Than Nyunt, who is also chief of staff of the Myanmar Navy, 
is visiting Japan on his way home from a meeting of the United 
Nations Children's Fund in Mexico City.

  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. 
  Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to 
inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that 
US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear 
experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the 
United States had failed to release full information about its 
nuclear test program in the Marshalls. 
  His comments followed a recent medical study confirming that 
the Marshalls had a rate of thyroid tumours dramatically higher 
than in other parts of the world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980's, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  "But US officials told us there was no further information 
to 
provide to us," he said, adding that the US statements had 
proved to be false. 
  "The United States wasn't fair to the Marshall Islands 
during 
the negotiations (of a treaty known as the Compact of Free 
Association between the two nations)." 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in US courts seeking 
about five billion US dollars in compensation for damages from 
the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of US compensation "needs to be revisited." 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that "all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations." 
  Their contention is supported by a leading US congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to US President Bill Clinton earlier this month, 
Miller wrote: "This committee has long been concerned that the 
entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls Islands has 
not yet been told and that the health and well-being of a 
significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at all 
the facts." 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further US 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  "In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored," he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

  [Text] Jakarta, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA -- President Suharto 
hopes that protection programs against AIDS will be increased in 
view of the fact that the number of persons suffering from the 
disease is increasing. 
  According to Azwar Anas, coordinating minister for the 
people's welfare who spoke after he was received by President 
Suharto on 20 January at Istana Merdeka [Freedom Palace], the 
number of persons suffering from AIDS in Indonesia is 194 at 
present. Sixty-four persons suffer from AIDS in metropolitan 
Jakarta, 22 in Bali, 54 in Irian Jaya, 22 in East Java, 14 in 
Riau, five in West Java, and one each in West Sumatra and West 
Kalimantan. 
  In this connection the cabinet ministers concerned are 
actively promoting preventive measures, one of which is teaching 
the community healthy sexual practices. Minister Azwar Anas 
added: "We know that AIDS is spread in particular by sexual 
relations with persons of the same sex, rather than with the 
opposite sex. The symptoms only appear after one year, and there 
are positive indications after five years." 
  Azwar Anas said that, previously, protective measures 
against 
AIDS were handled only by the minister of tourism, posts, and 
telecommunications and the minister of health. Now all ministers 
are working on this matter with the coordinating minister for 
the people's welfare. 
  In addition to reporting on the AIDS question Minister Azwar 
Anas also reported on the matter of stocks of iodized salt. In 
view of the fact that the Indonesian people prefer to use 
technical or raw salt, it is feared that they will suffer a 
decline in IQ [Intelligence Quotient]. 
  There are two kinds of salt. There is technical or raw salt 
which is used, among other things, for fishing purposes and so 
forth, and there is salt for human consumption. Clearly, the 
people prefer to use raw or technical salt, the price of which 
is cheaper at 35 rupiahs per kilogram. However, many people are 
not aware that their average IQ will decline as a result of 
using technical or raw salt. 
  In this connection, the president expressed hoped that 
iodized salt will be used more widely by the people. 
  Minister Azwar Anas said that at the present time the 
government is making a national survey to be used in preparing a 
Presidential Instruction on the Most Disadvantaged Villages 
(IDT). Individual families in the survey will be listed under 
five classifications: Low Welfare, Welfare 1, Welfare 2, Welfare 
3, and Welfare 3+. 
  The classification of "Low Welfare" means a family that 
lives 
in a home which is inadequate in four ways: food, shelter, 
clothing, and health. 
  "Welfare 1" means a family that is adequately provided for 
in 
the above four categories, but that is unable to pay for 
education costs. "Welfare 3+" means a family that is adequately 
provided for in all of the above categories and whose members 
are able to help others, such as by contributing goods, giving 
alms, and so forth. 
  It is hoped that all of this data will have been collected 
by 
April 1994, so that action can be taken to improve the situation 
in the most disadvantaged villages. 
  Minister Azwar Anas also reported to the president on 
preparations for the Social Development Summit Conference. 
Indonesia has been designated deputy chairman of the conference 
by the United Nations to represent the countries of Southeast 
Asia. The summit conference will be preceded by three meetings 
at lower levels. There is a possibility that President Suharto 
will attend the meeting in Copenhagen, that is, when the summit 
conference is held. 
  The minister also reported on the floods which are currently 
affecting some areas of Indonesia. The office of the 
coordinating minister for the people's welfare has 2.0 billion 
rupiahs available to help victims of the present floods, for 
example in Flores, West Java, and West Sumatra.

  [Text] The smooth faces of spokespersons at a press 
conference held Saturday afternoon of last week suddenly put on 
a sour smile when a reporter asked, "Do the founders of the 
Indonesian AIDS Foundation have any close friends or relatives 
who are HIV positive and is that why they were really interested 
in establishing a foundation which has the difficult task of 
encouraging social self-help in the battle against AIDS, 
providing public information about AIDS and battling the 
consequences of the spread of AIDS which has already taken place 
in Indonesia?" 
  The reporters who were present on the eighteenth floor of a 
tall building on Sudirman Street in Jakarta that evening were 
introduced to a recently- established foundation set up by a 
notarial instrument dated 17 August 1993: the Indonesian AIDS 
Foundation. Speaking as spokespersons and as the founders of the 
foundation were former Minister of Health Adhyatma, 
businesswoman Martina Widjaja and notary public Kartini Muljadi. 
  The question was posed because there is something that 
bothers people: Why is it so hard to connect the battle against 
AIDS with the professions of some of the people who are listed 
as directors of the foundation. They are former State Minister 
for Population and the Environment Emil Salim, former Chairman 
of the Money Market Supervisory Board Marzuki Usman, notary 
public Kartini Muljadi, businesswoman Martina Widjaja, who is 
chairman of the foundation, Juniarti Alatas, and Darwina Pontjo 
Sutowo. Fortunately, Martina, the chairman, answered the 
question with a friendly smile, "AIDS is now a problem for all 
of us, a national problem, a world problem, so it's only natural 
that everyone is concerned." 
  Those words were also echoed by Adhyatma's statement. As the 
former Minister of Health supervising the Chairman of the 
Indonesian AIDS Committee, which has its headquarters in the 
Department of Health, Adhyatma said that AIDS can be viewed as a 
problem for us all because the AIDS pandemic is causing an 
extraordinary decrease in productivity in Indonesia. Pandemic? 
"Yes, because it is estimated that there are now 20,000 people 
in Indonesia who have been infected by the HIV virus," said 
Adhyatma, adding that official government figures are 150 people 
as of July 1993. With an economic cost of 33 million Rupiah per 
year per AIDS case -- 20,000 cases means a national cost of 660 
billion Rupiah per year -- it is clear that the AIDS pandemic is 
a national problem. 
<H5>  Half a Billion </H5>
  All right, this foundation has been established with an 
initial funding of 500 million Rupiah. According to the 
foundation's statutes, future funding for the foundation's 
routine programs will come from public contributions and from 
efforts to provide additional funding. "You don't have to worry 
about our ability to raise funds. Many people in the foundation 
are quite experienced at this," Martina told reporters. 
  It was not explained how the funds would be used for the 
foundation's four main programs: Intensive public information on 
the battle against AIDS will be given to employees of 
corporations and to young peoples' groups; training for 
information management; establishing an AIDS Communication 
Center to receive and channel relevant and accurate information 
about AIDS to the public; and organizing a Policy Study to make 
a success of the recommendations for the battle against AIDS. At 
Saturday's press conference there was no explanation, for 
example, of whether the Indonesian AIDS Foundation would take 
financial responsibility for training or whether the trainees 
would pay the foundation. What was clear was that according to 
the foundation's statutes this is a non-profit foundation. 
<H5>  Open to the Public </H5>
  With the creation of the Indonesian AIDS Foundation, Jakarta 
now has an additonal way of giving information about AIDS since 
Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and the University of Indonesia 
Medical School last February dedicated an AIDS Information 
Center, which has 24-hour automated telephone service at (021) 
3903838 (twelve lines) and which provides information about AIDS 
in Indonesian, English and Japanese. 
  The Indonesian AIDS Foundation can be reached at Gedung PS 
1, 
Third Floor, Let. Gen. S. Parman St., Lot 78, Slipi, Jakarta 
11410, telephone (021) 5495313. 
  The Foundation's Development Committee consists of Chairman 
Kartini Muljadi, Deputy Chairman Martina Widjaja and members Dr. 
Ibnu Sutowo, Emil Salim, Dr. Adhyatma, Juniarti Alatas, Jakob 
Oetama, Marzuki Usman, Sarlito Wirawan, Kartono Mohamad, Dr. 
Lukas Hendrata, Hartati Tjakra Murdaya, Mawarwati Djamaloeddin 
and Darwina Pontjo Sutowo. From 1993 to 1995 the Indonesian AIDS 
Foundation will be directed by Chairman Martina Widjaja, First 
Deputy Chairman Dr. Kartono Mohamad, Second Deputy Chairman 
Darwina Pontjo Utomo, Executive Director Pooroe Utomo and the 
following members: Mawarwati Djamaloeddin and Sarlito Wirawan.

  [Text] Den Pasar, KOMPAS -- During the past two months the 
total number of persons suffering from AIDS in Bali has 
increased by two, from 23 as of 15 September to 25 as of 30 
November. Meanwhile, the total number of persons suffering from 
AIDS on a national basis has risen to 185 individuals in 12 
provinces, since the first HIV case was discovered in West 
Kalimantan Province. 
  Dr. Tuti Parwati Merati, chairperson of the AIDS Working and 
Research Group at the Faculty of Medicine of Udayana University 
in Den Pasar, is treating a person in Den Pasar who has recently 
been discovered to be infected with the HIV virus. The person 
concerned came directly to her clinic and asked for a blood 
test. Later, after "Elisa" and "Western Blot" tests were 
performed, it was learned that the person concerned was infected 
with the HIV virus. The person concerned, who is in the tourism 
business and is 26 years old, had himself tested because he 
became aware that his behavior involved the risk of infection. 
  Doctor Tuti said on 2 December: "The person concerned took 
the initiative to have himself examined after obtaining 
information through the mass media. Later on, he came to my 
clinic to ask for a blood test. It turned out that he was 
HIV-positive." 
<H5>  Positive </H5>
  Regarding the participation of a number of groups, including 
ulama [Muslim religious teachers], businessmen, and officials 
from a number of government services, in programs concerned with 
handling AIDS, such as the seminar held in Jakarta on the 
commemoration of World AIDS Day on 1 December, Doctor Tuti 
thought that this was a positive sign. This is because this 
disease is not just the responsibility of the Department of 
Health. Neither is it possible for the matter to be resolved 
through the media alone, because there is a close connection 
with sexual behavior. 
  According to Dr. Tuti Parwati, who is also chairperson of 
the 
Indonesian Business Image Foundation [YCUI] and is active in the 
field of handling AIDS, the involvement of businessmen in this 
area is very much needed. For example, in helping to provide 
funds to support community information activity. The same thing 
is true with businessmen in the tourism field in particular. 
They can provide warnings of the danger of AIDS to their hotel 
guests. 
  A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Gde Muninjaya, MPH 
[master's degree in public health], chairman of the 
Epidemiological Research and Training Unit of Udayana 
University. He said, for example, that the involvement of the 
Department of Manpower in handling AIDS is intended, among other 
things, to provide security and protection to workers known to 
be infected with the AIDS virus. Those who suffer from AIDS can 
be protected from being dismissed from their jobs or from being 
quarantined. Doctor Muninjaya said: "As long as those suffering 
from AIDS are not quarantined, as happens in Western countries, 
we must take action quickly to protect them." 
  Regarding activities to celebrate World AIDS Day in 1993, 
Dr. 
Tuti Parwati said that, in cooperation with a number of senior 
high schools and the Student Senate of the Faculty of Medicine 
at Udayana University, the YCUI sponsored the "World AIDS Day 
Walkathon" at the end of November 1993. After that a discussion 
was held with students at senior high schools concerning the 
danger of AIDS and related problems facing us. 
  According to Doctor Tuti, the AIDS problem cannot be handled 
by only one or two events each year. Rather, it must be handled 
on a continuing basis. The information efforts undertaken by the 
YCUI up to the present have included the formation of discussion 
groups, at which persons suffering from AIDS talk about their 
feelings and the problems which they face. One of them, who has 
previously been provided with a variety of information, acts as 
the chairman of the meeting. 
  Doctor Tuti said that the attitude of persons suffering from 
AIDS who have received this training has been very positive.

  [Text] According to data from the Department of Health up 
to and including 6 December 1993, 187 persons are recorded as 
suffering from AIDS in Indonesia. This is an increase of 12 
persons, compared with the total at the end of October 1993, 
when 175 persons were listed by the Department of Health as 
suffering from the disease. Of the 187 persons suffering from 
AIDS 43 have full-blown AIDS and 25 have died. The remaining 18 
are still alive. 
  Meanwhile, according to data from WHO [World Health 
Organization], the total number diagnosed as being HIV-positive 
throughout Indonesia is between 20,000 and 30,000. 
  Minister of Health Sujudi made this statement in testimony 
before Committee VIII of Parliament in Jakarta on 7 December. He 
added that the most serious aspect of these figures in Indonesia 
is that the numbers tend to increase exponentially. According to 
him, the figure of those suffering from AIDS has doubled over 
the past two years and tripled over the past year. 
  He also reported that his ministry has estimated that it 
will 
spend 5.0 billion rupiahs on the care of AIDS victims during 
fiscal year 1994/1995. This money will be used for screening 
blood donors, research, distributing information, laboratory 
equipment, training health workers, and counseling services. 
  In answer to a question from a member of the committee about 
the very surprising difference between the figures from the 
Department of Health and WHO on AIDS victims, the minister of 
health said that the WHO figure of 20,000 to 30,000 was arrived 
at by using several models ranging from the simplest to the most 
complex. Meanwhile, the minister of health said that the figure 
of 187 is the total actually reported to the Department of 
Health. The Department itself makes predictions based on how 
sexually transmitted disease has spread in Indonesia. These 
predictions are calculated by extrapolating statistics. Sujudi 
continued that by using this kind of calculation the figures 
obtained by WHO and those of the Department are not very far 
apart: about 20,000 persons suffer from AIDS. 
  Sujudi said that to deal with AIDS, the government has 
formed 
the National Committee for Handling AIDS, chaired by the 
coordinating minister for the people's welfare. This committee 
has developed a policy for handling AIDS on a national basis. 
Sujudi said: "In the near future it is hoped that a Presidential 
Decision Memorandum will be issued to deal with AIDS." 
  In answer to a question from a member of the committee 
concerning the amount of counterfeit medicine available the 
minister of health said that the punishment handed out to 
producers and traffickers in counterfeit medicine is still too 
light. The fines collected until now, based on an ordinance 
covering medicine containing alcohol, amount to 5,000 guilders 
for each case. This is considered to be the equivalent of 5,000 
rupiahs. 
  However, he continued, with the enactment of Law No. 23 of 
1992 on health matters, it is hoped that producers and 
traffickers of counterfeit medicine will be discouraged from 
engaging in this kind of activity. This law provides for a 
sentence of up to 15 years in jail and a fine of up to 300 
million rupiahs. 
  Sujudi said that another problem encountered by the 
department in dealing with counterfeit medicine is that 
frequently cases brought to court are not actually tried. 
Therefore, the department has asked its officials in the 
provinces to raise these cases with the mass media. 
  Sujudi said: "This effort is intended to exercise a more 
definite social and indirect control on the production and 
distribution of counterfeit medicine. In this way it is hoped 
that there will be no more cases involving the production and 
distribution of counterfeit medicine which are not prosecuted." 
  According to Sujudi, the efforts being made by the 
Department 
of Health to speed up a more even distribution of medical 
doctors throughout the country involve PTT assignments [the 
appointment of personnel on a temporary basis]. Since February 
1992, 3,988 medical doctors, divided into four groups, have been 
given temporary appointments to the government health service. 
Some 2,135 doctors have been assigned to ordinarily settled 
areas, 1,185 of them have been assigned to isolated areas, and 
668 have 3n3 been assigned to very isolated areas. These 
employees have been hired on a temporary basis, in anticipation 
of the possibility that the number of permanent state employees 
being trained will be reduced to "zero" in the course of 1995. 
  The appointment of temporary employees will later be applied 
to other workers in the health sector, including dentists, 
pharmacists, and midwives assigned to the villages. Their 
assignments will be carefully coordinated with the needs of the 
provinces where they will work. It is planned that during fiscal 
year 1994/1995 2,200 medical doctors, 600 dentists, 300 
pharmacists, and 11,000 midwives will be assigned to villages. 
Funds for the construction of housing, amounting to more than 
5.0 million rupiahs per employee, will be provided on a special 
basis for village midwives, in addition to other costs and 
transportation facilities such as bicycles.

  [Text] AIDS victims are expected to be more numerous in 
Indonesia next year. It is estimated that about 20,000 people 
are now infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the 
virus that causes AIDS. About 6 percent, or about 1,200 people, 
of those infected are expected to develop AIDS (a disease that 
weakens the body's immune system). Those who show symptoms of 
AIDS require treatment, like it or not. 
  Data so far gathered by the Department of Health show that 
at 
the end of last year there were 177 HIV victims, a figure that 
rapidly increased to 187. "Clinically, only about 40 of that 
number are actually suffering from AIDS," said Dr. Broto 
Wasisto, M.D., M.P.H. [Master of Public Health], director 
general of medical services of the Department of Health. In view 
of this phenomenon, class A and B hospitals throughout Indonesia 
must be prepared to treat them. "The Department of Health has 
distributed to all hospitals books with instructions on how to 
care for AIDS victims," he declared. 
  Not all hospitals are able to do this yet. In a panel 
discussion at RSCM [Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital] last year on 
improving capabilities for managing AIDS cases at hospitals 
throughout Jakarta, it was learned that hospitals are generally 
ready. "The problem, however, is that their perception of 
treating AIDS is not yet the same," said Dr. Samsuridjal Djauzi, 
an internist who also handles AIDS at the RSCM. 
  A discussion panel participant from PELNI [Indonesian 
National Maritime Company] Hospital admitted, "We feel awkward 
explaining AIDS to a patient or the patient's family." Thus, 
procedures for the counseling of patients are clearly important, 
and not only from the medical aspect. "They are often stressed 
and afraid and still consider AIDS a stigma or something 
unusual," Samsuridjal said. 
  Dr. Lukas Mangindaan, a psychiatrist who provides AIDS 
counseling at RSCM, said that counseling is necessary in order 
to find out how much the patient and the patient's family know 
about HIV. "Discussion of sexual matters must be done in a way 
that does not embarrass or offend the patient. Questions about 
sex need to have a special place in AIDS consultation, because 
most transmission of HIV occurs through sexual relations," Lukas 
said. 
  At RSCM, patients infected with HIV, and especially AIDS, 
are 
treated immediately without the patient being put to the trouble 
of administrative procedures and questions of advance payment. 
In fact, RSCM also gives basic medicines without charge. These 
include antibiotics and lifesaving medicines of an emergency 
nature, such as infusions. 
  The upgrading of hospital facilities to treat AIDS patients 
is actually not a difficult matter. Of course, additional cost, 
such as for procuring gloves, will be incurred to prevent spread 
of the disease. The use of gloves, however, is not just for 
AIDS, because there should be safety measures to prevent the 
spread of disease between doctors/staff and patients and among 
patients. For that reason, doctors, nurses, and cleaning staff 
must use gloves. 
  It is clear that doctors, nurses, laboratories, 
administrative staff, and cleaning personnel must be prepared 
for treating AIDS patients. Samsuridjal described RSCM's 
experience. When an AIDS case was diagnosed, links had already 
been established with the clinical laboratory and clinical 
pathologist so that when a specimen was taken from the patient, 
it was immediately dealt with safely. In addition, within the 
AIDS treatment team a doctor must be appointed to be 
responsible. When that is not done, sometimes not even one 
doctor examines a patient. 
  "The important thing is the willingness of doctors and 
hospitals to treat AIDS patients," said Samsuridjal. There have 
been hospitals that for lack of experience have been unwilling 
to treat patients and have sent them to RSCM. "That should not 
happen," said Dr. Kartono Muhammad, general chairman of the IDI 
[Indonesia Physicians Association]. Besides RSCM, other 
hospitals in Jakarta are able to treat AIDS victims. They 
include MMC [expansion not given] Hospital, PERTAMINA [National 
Oil and Natural Gas Company] Hospital, Kramat Hospital, Mitra 
Keluarga Hospital, and St. Carolus Hospital. 
  According to Broto Wasisto, for the treatment of AIDS the 
focus is generally on class A and B hospitals, which have 
specialist doctors and complete facilities. Many nurses from 
class A and B hospitals have been sent overseas to learn how to 
care for AIDS patients. "Two years ago Indonesia sent nurses to 
Australia, the United States, and Thailand," Broto said. 
  According to Samsuridjal, AIDS has attacked not only 
residents of big cities but people from small cities, too. He 
recommended, therefore, that class C hospitals -- which normally 
are in the provinces -- also be prepared. Broto said there are 
two steps that class C hospitals must take if they receive AIDS 
patients: Send them to class A or B hospitals, or bring in 
specialists from class A or B hospitals. This is called a 
referral system, whether from above or from below, depending on 
the situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Prasoet Thongcharuen, MD] </F>
  [Excerpts] On 17 September, I was invited by the Public 
Health and Epidemiology Institute, Ministry of Public Health, 
Laos, to participate in a seminar on rabies and hepatitis B. 
Attending the seminar on behalf of Laos was Dr. Somthana 
Tuangmala, the director of that institute. I would like to tell 
you about the rabies situation in Laos. 
  The opening ceremony was held at 0815. Dr. Khemphet, the 
head 
of the Central Office, Ministry of Public Health, whose position 
is equivalent to that of a Thai under secretary, officially 
opened the seminar. A total of 186 people, including doctors and 
public health officials from Vientiane Province and other 
provinces, attended the seminar. [passage omitted] 
  Laos now has a population of 4.2 million people. The number 
of reported rabies cases is much lower than the actual number. 
In 1988, 90 animals were tested for rabies, and 83, or 93 
percent, tested positive for rabies. In 1989, 96 animals were 
tested, and 89, or 93 percent, tested positive. In 1990, 1991, 
and 1992, 107, 112, and 144 animals were tested respectively and 
more than 90 percent of the animals tested positive each of 
those years. 
  Most of the animals tested were dogs. This means that just 
as 
in Thailand, in Laos dogs are the main carriers of rabies. In 
1989, a total of 273 people were bitten by a dog and given 
rabies vaccinations. In 1992, the number rose to 782 people, and 
in the first eight months of this year, 557 people have received 
rabies vaccinations after being bitten by a dog. 
  What is worrisome is that Laos has always used a vaccine 
produced from animal brain tissue. This vaccine is similar to 
that produced by the Saowapha Institute and the Government 
Pharmaceutical Organization here in Thailand. Laos does not 
produce this vaccine itself. It was obtained from the Soviet 
Union, its old mentor. But now, its old mentor is collapsing and 
so Laos does not have any of this vaccine. 
  But there is a new vaccine that is produced from cell 
cultures that is sold at government drug stores. And some people 
cross the river to Thailand to buy vaccine at drug stores in 
Nong Khai Province. They pack it in bottles and take it back to 
Laos. There is also a duck embryo vaccine produced by 
Switzerland. I was told that patrol vehicles provide vaccination 
services. 
  As for preventing and controlling this disease, the [Lao] 
Department of Livestock Development and Animal Husbandry, which 
is similar to our department, is responsible for handling 
things. It vaccinates dogs. But very few dogs are actually 
receiving rabies vaccinations. In 1988, a total of 2,800 dogs 
were vaccinated, in 1989, 2,300 were vaccinated, in 1990, 3,650 
were vaccinated, in 1991, 4,520 were vaccinated, and in 1992, 
7,230 were vaccinated. 
  What Laos must do in order to prevent and control this 
disease is to conduct more studies on this disease and obtain 
anti-rabies vaccines for both people and animals so that there 
is always a supply on hand, particularly vaccine produced by 
cell cultures, which is rather expensive. The rabies monitoring 
and reporting system must be improved, and the capabilities of 
the laboratories in the cities and provinces must be improved. 
The laws concerned must be implemented strictly, and an effort 
must be made to get neighboring countries (meaning Thailand) and 
international organizations to provide technical help in order 
to obtain the technical support and equipment needed. 
  At the seminar, I discussed the broad epidemiology situation 
regarding rabies in various countries in the world and described 
the symptoms of this disease. I told them about the various 
vaccines available and the recommendations made by the World 
Health Organization in giving vaccinations. I also told them 
about my own personal experiences, because I have been involved 
with this disease since 1962. And I am still involved in this. 
  As for hepatitis B, I told those at the seminar that there 
are several types of hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, 
and E. These are interesting, because they are encountered 
frequently, with the most common types being hepatitis A and B. 
I discussed the symptoms, secondary infections, and the 
treatment and prevention of this disease using vaccines. There 
are now vaccines to control both hepatitis A and B. In Laos, few 
people are given vaccinations to prevent hepatitis B. This is 
because doctors and other medical personnel do not have much 
knowledge about this disease, and the vaccine is still very 
expensive (one dose costs 9,000 kip). I told them that Thailand 
is now inoculating about 1 million infants a year free of 
charge. Dr. Somthana said that Laos will have to find a way to 
obtain help from international organizations in studying 
hepatitis B. After I ended my talk on giving preventive 
vaccinations, many people asked me questions about this. 
  Dr. Rattanapon, the head of one of the examination 
laboratories, was one of those who was very interested in this. 
He asked me to provide him with documents concerning the various 
strains of hepatitis, because Laos lacks such documents. I told 
him that we do not live very far away and that if he wants 
anything, all he has to do is ask and I will send it to him. 
  I will stop here for today.

  [Excerpt] Malaria: It has been reported that of 1,224 
people in Sekong Province receiving blood tests 137 were found 
to have malaria while 51 were found to have leprosy. In Laman 
District and Kaleum District there were 19 [with malaria] out of 
1,112 examined. Those with malaria were not involved with any of 
the local medical organizations, and this allowed the disease to 
spread. It was also reported that in Houa Phan Province 128 out 
of 665 tested were found to have malaria. The numbers for those 
being examined and receiving care indicated that the percentage 
of those receiving care had dropped to 88.28 percent of the 
total with the disease. The report also stated that in Namo 
District and Khai District of Oudomsai Province 173 were found 
to have malaria out of 838 who had blood tests. 
  Diarrhea: A source in Savannakhet Province reported that in 
August there were diarrhea outbreaks in Ban Khok Neua Village 
and Ban Khok Tai Village of Sibounheuang Canton and Ban Dong Noi 
Village of Outhoumphon District, and five died as a result. At 
present the disease is still spreading. It was also reported 
that at the beginning of the rainy season there had been 
diarrhea outbreaks in Phinsepon District and Vilabouli District 
which had caused dozens of deaths. The cause for this was that 
eating practices lacked the hygiene of the three cleans. 
  It was also reported that in just ten days in Nongbok 
District of Khammouan Province 50 had died from measles, malaria 
and diarrhea. Of these 34 died of diarrhea. Examinations in 
Nongpham Canton, Nachampa and Dongkasin Canton found 141 
children with measles and 900 with diarrhea. It was found that 
61.77 percent of the 392 people receiving blood tests had 
malaria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shah Alam, 29 December -- In 1994 the Ministry of 
Health will undertake a campaign against AIDS resulting from 
casual sexual relations. 
  Mohammed Farid Ariffin, deputy minister of health, said that 
cases of AIDS resulting from casual sex have increased, 
following a reduction in the number of cases of the disease 
caused by drug addicts sharing needles for injecting narcotics. 
  The deputy minister said that AIDS resulting from casual sex 
has increased from 2-3 percent to 10-15 percent now, while the 
incidence of the disease caused by drug addicts sharing needles 
for injecting narcotics has dropped from 90 percent to 80 
percent. 
  He added: "If we are not careful, this situation will become 
more serious if the number of cases of AIDS spread through 
casual sexual relations increases further and even exceeds the 
number of cases among drug abusers." He made this statement to 
reporters on 29 December after opening an AIDS awareness 
campaign in the State of Selangor and an AIDS Hotline (Telephone 
No. 03-5501550) in Shah Alam. 
  According to the deputy minister, a majority of the 7,097 
persons who are HIV positive are between 15 and 35 years old. 
  He said that as a result the Ministry of Health has 
undertaken a campaign against AIDS resulting from casual sexual 
relations, using for this purpose most of the 1994 allocation of 
24 million Malaysian dollars to prevent AIDS. 
  He said: "The ministry will handle this problem carefully 
and 
will emphasize and try to encourage the people to live moral 
lives and observe proper values." 
  Mohammed Farid said that the ministry will also obtain the 
views of leaders of all religious groups, including Islamic 
ulama [religious teachers], and seek their opinions on handling 
the problem of AIDS resulting from casual sexual relations. He 
said: "This problem will be referred to them once again because 
the government's wish to encourage people to use condoms when 
they have sexual relations is a sensitive matter." 
  Previously, in his speech on the occasion he expressed the 
hope that the people would also be vigilant and not be careless, 
although he said that these points are always included in the 
campaign against AIDS. 
  He said: "I am concerned that, whenever I discuss this 
matter, I find that people pay little attention to AIDS. I do 
not want AIDS to spread because of carelessness." 
  He warned that hospital personnel should always follow 
established guidelines when they treat people suffering from 
AIDS.

  [Excerpts] At a seminar on controlling and preventing AIDS 
in children that was held by the Ministry of Public Health at 
the Ambassador Hotel last Monday, Dr. Detchawan Phatisuwan, a 
preventive medicine expert and a senior doctor at the Department 
of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, said that AIDS 
is spreading rapidly among both sexes and among all age and 
occupational groups. Statistics of the Epidemiology Division, 
Ministry of Public Health, show that as of 31 August 1993, there 
were 3,000 people with full-blown cases of AIDS and 2,623 with 
AIDS-related symptoms. A total of 510 people have died. Of those 
with AIDS, 259 are children in the 0 to 14 age group. Most of 
these contracted the virus from their mother. [passage omitted] 
  Some people have predicted that by the year 2000, 
approximately 80,000 children will have AIDS. As of today, there 
is no cure for this disease. Thus, prevention is at the heart of 
controlling the spread of this disease. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Wimon Siriwathin, an obstetrician at the Ratchawithi 
Hospital, said that a report from Mahidol University predicts 
that this year, there will be 136,532 cases of AIDS in women 
between the ages of 15 and 49. And from monitoring the incidence 
of AIDS in pregnant women, the Epidemiology Division has found 
that three northern provinces have the highest number of 
pregnant women with AIDS. The Ratchawithi Hospital, which has 
one of the largest obstetrics departments in Bangkok, has found 
that the number of pregnant women with AIDS is increasing 
rapidly. During the first 6 months of this year, 145 pregnant 
women, or 1.52 percent of the 9,644 women who gave birth, were 
found to have the AIDS virus. Most of these women were between 
the ages of 17 and 31. 
  Besides this, Dr. Usa Thitsayakon, a pediatrician at the 
Chulalongkorn Hospital, said that studies conducted at the 
Chulalongkorn Hospital have shown that most of the children with 
AIDS contracted the disease from their mother. And most of the 
women contracted the disease from their husbands, who used the 
services of prostitutes. The study also showed that the rate of 
infection from mother to child is 33.3 percent.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] On 5 October, the Public and 
Community Development Association, Thai Red Cross, Department of 
Public Welfare, and private companies issued a statement on the 
"Ban Than Nam Chai" project. This statement was issued by Mr. 
Michai Wirawaithaya, president of the association; Mr. Wirasit 
Titthitrai, deputy director for social affairs of the AIDS 
Project, Thai Red Cross; Mrs. Suraphi Wasinon from the 
Department of Public Welfare, and Dr. Usa Thitsayadon, an 
obstetrician at Chulalongkorn Hospital. 
  Concerning the AIDS situation, Mr. Michai said that the 
number of people with AIDS continues to rise. In particular, the 
rate of infection among prostitutes and drug addicts is very 
high. And a very worrisome group is pregnant women, among whom 
the rate of infection has doubled since last year, increasing 
from 1 percent to almost 2 percent this year. Every year, about 
2 million women become pregnant. Thus, about 20,000 pregnant 
women have AIDS. Almost 6,000 infants have been born with AIDS 
and died. 
  About two-thirds of the children who survive, that is 
approximately 18,000 [as published], will become orphans because 
the mother will die of AIDS. The Department of Public Welfare 
cannot look after all these children who have lost their 
mothers, because the number of such children is double the 
number that the department is now looking after. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Michai said that the risk of contracting AIDS is 10 to 
30 
times greater for those who have a venereal disease, which 
includes syphilis, herpes, and chancroid. In particular, those 
people who have syphilis and who contract the AIDS virus usually 
die very quickly. The virus, which usually spreads to the brain 
slowly, will spread to the brain very rapidly. 
  "AIDS will continue to spread as long as Thai men continue 
to 
have sexual relations with prostitutes. Today, there are about 
600,000 to 800,000 people with the disease, or an average of 
approximately 700,000. This figure comes from the Ministry of 
Public Health." 
  Mr. Wirasit talked about youths and housewives. He said that 
it is very difficult to control the spread of this disease in 
these groups. The average age of these people is between 20 and 
29. In these two groups, the number of people with AIDS is 
increasing at a rate of 500 to 700 people a day. 
  "Women are at great risk of contracting AIDS because they 
trust their husbands. Today, about 5 to 10 people a day are 
dying from AIDS. I obtained this figure from the Epidemiology 
Division, [reports on] military conscripts with AIDS, and 
hospital reports on pregnant women and children with AIDS." 
  As for the number of people who have died from AIDS at 
various hospitals, particularly hospitals in northern provinces, 
about 1 to 2 people a day are dying at each of the hospitals. At 
present, the ratio of men to women with AIDS is about 2:1. 
  Dr. Usa said that today, a large number of children have 
AIDS. This is clear from the fact that approximately 300 infants 
born at Chulalongkorn Hospital were born with AIDS. About 
one-third of these will die within 2 to 3 years. The rest will 
die by the age of 10. [passage omitted]

Released From Hospital"] 
  [Text] Sixty-two people, all of them workers at the Pernik 
company "Stomana, A.D. [stockholding company]," have been at the 
hospital for infectious diseases from the middle of December 
until 19 January. The diagnosis is trichinosis. Sixty patients 
have been released, but two remain at the hospital. Yesterday, 
the deputy minister of health care, Dr. Lyubomir Kumanov; a 
national consultant on infectious and tropical diseases, 
Professor Petur Petrov; and representatives of NIZPB [Scientific 
and Eductional Institute of Communicable and Parasitic 
Diseases], the hospital for infectious diseases, and the KhEI 
[Hygiene-Epidemiological Inspectorate] in Pernik, met to 
consider the origin of the trichinosis infection in "Stomana." 
  The specialists have established that the cause of infection 
is the consumption of infected pork by the patients, and not 
through radiation as rumored. As yet, the exact source of the 
meat is not known.

of AIDS would suffice if it did not have to be used for the 
drugs and equipment of the many facilities. The commission, in 
which AIDS experts from both government and non-government 
spheres are represented, recently decided on the following 
distribution of the money: 20 percent will go on prevention 
(education, behavior surveys, and so on) 26 percent on testing, 
and more than a half for everything else, principally treatment 
and investment. this means that health insurance covers, for 
example, only the drugs for hospitalized patients, and not for 
those whose disease has not yet developed and are being treated 
as outpatients. According to Trojan, who is also president of 
the non-government Association for the Struggle Against AIDS and 
for Sexual Education, the commission could not turn down the 
funds for this purpose because it would endanger human lives. 
"Let us call things by their names, and do not boast to the 
World Health Organization of 70 million spent on prevention, if, 
in fact, the money is only covering for the state or health 
insurance," Trojan says. Just for a comparison: Great Britain 
invests an annual 20 million pounds on prevention. 
  Non-government organizations receive approximately 7 percent 
of the 70 million. (The World Health Organization generally 
recommends, however, that at least 15 percent of the total be 
allocated to these organizations.) The AIDS Help Society wants, 
for instance, to establish a so-called light house for those 
sick and dying of AIDS. According to Trojan, non-government 
organizations have to fight much harder for funds. The idea 
apparently still prevails that they are more likely to waste the 
funds at their disposal than government institutions.

<F P=106> [R. Barjaktarevic report: "More Than 250 Children Contracted </F>
Meningitis"] 
  [Text] Seven persons with serious symptoms of typhoid 
fever were brought to Pristina University Hospital. The number 
of persons who contracted this dangerous disease, which was 
believed to have been eradicated, has risen to 77 during the 
last month. The epicenter is Stimlje, but typhoid fever might 
break out in almost all Kosovo towns. The doctors of Pristina 
University Hospital, including Professor Stevan Baljosevic, the 
head of hospital, have recommended all Kosovo inhabitants to 
boil water. 
  Children's meningitis, a disease that affects the brain, 
also 
appeared in Kosovo. More than 250 children have contracted the 
disease so far. 
  After having visited Stimlje, the epicenter of the serious 
infectious disease, Stevan Baljosevic gave the following answer 
to BORBA's question about the causes and possible consequences 
of the disease: 
  "The water-supply system of the Institute for Mentally 
Retarded Persons has been completely destroyed, the water is not 
chlorinated, and the water level in the basin from which it is 
taken is below the stream so that fresh water is mixed with 
sewage." 
  The symptoms of typhoid are unendurable stomachache, high 
fever, sweating, vomiting and general weakness.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Roberto de Souza Queiroz: "AIDS Expected To </F>
Kill 87,000 People in Country by 1995"; introductory paragraph 
in italics as published] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Health says that infection has 
increased in states along the cocaine route. 
  AIDS is expected to kill 87,000 people infected with HIV in 
Brazil by 1995. That figure represents nearly 30,000 deaths per 
year, most of them in the State of Sao Paulo, which has 59 
percent of all cases of the disease. That forecast appears in 
the Ministry of Health's seventh BOLETIM EPIDEMIOLOGICO, which 
was issued this week and reveals for the first time the trend 
toward an explosive increase in the epidemic in the states 
located along the cocaine route. The drug comes from the Andean 
countries and travels through western Brazil to the coast. 
  The ministry's statistical survey shows that between 1987 
and 
1991, AIDS cases increased more than fivefold in Mato Grosso do 
Sul -- on the cocaine route -- where the rate of incidence rose 
from 0.8 to 4.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. On the other 
hand, in a state such as Rio Grande do Norte, which is located 
away from the cocaine route, the rate of increase was much 
slower: from 0.6 to 1.9 during the same period. "The 
differentiating factor between the two states is precisely the 
relative frequency of intravenous drug use as a risk factor for 
AIDS," the document says. The study also states that "the faster 
spread of the epidemic associated with intravenous drug use can 
be identified in other states on the western border or in 
municipalities located along a probable trafficking route. 
  The report draws attention to the way the epidemic spread in 
Thailand, the profile of which may be repeated in Brazil. The 
first phase of the disease in Thailand was characterized by the 
rapid spread of the virus among drug users. Those infected in 
the second phase were prostitutes, and in the third phase, the 
virus reached men who were not drug users. In the fourth phase, 
those infected men passed the virus on to their regular 
partners, and in the fifth phase, there was an increase in 
vertical transmission -- infected women began transmitting the 
virus to their children while the latter were still in the womb. 
  What worries epidemiologists is that in Brazil, the wave of 
infection through intravenous drugs is affecting primarily 
adolescents. Among infected young people, 58 percent contracted 
AIDS through the use of drugs. The statistical survey shows that 
1,361 minors under 15 years of age have already contracted the 
disease.

<F P=106> [Article by Aureliano Biancarelli: "AIDS Increasing Among </F>
Women Around the World"] 
  [Text] The rise in AIDS cases among women all over the 
world is worrying the WHO. The organization estimates that there 
are about 3 million infected women in the world. 
  The rise in AIDS among women means more infected children by 
vertical transmission. The virus is transmitted from mother to 
child during pregnancy, at birth, or during breast-feeding. 
  In Sao Paulo -- the state which best illustrates the 
development of the disease in our country -- the ratio was 43 
infected men for every infected woman in 1985. Today the ratio 
is four to one. 
  That ratio -- equivalent to 25 percent -- is much higher 
than 
in the United States (where 12 percent of cases are women) and 
Canada (5 percent). Some African countries are way out in front, 
with women constituting more than 50 percent of the cases.

  In Brazil, the increase in the disease among women is linked 
especially to intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. 
According to experts at the Ministry of Health, it is the man 
who becomes infected through drugs or by homosexual relations 
without the use of condoms and who then passes the disease on to 
his wife or girlfriend. 
  According to data from the Sao Paulo Secretariat of Health, 
48.85 percent of the women were infected through heterosexual 
relations. Another 29.8 percent caught the virus through 
intravenous drug use. According to the Ministry of Health, our 
country currently has 43,964 reported AIDS cases. The figure may 
be at least 20 percent higher. Of the official total, 18,128 
have already died. 
  The number of infected individuals -- those who have not yet 
manifested the disease -- ranges from 500,000 to 700,000, 
depending on one's source. Sao Paulo State has 62.8 percent of 
the cases. It needs to be remembered that Sao Paulo has less 
underreporting and is faster at recording reported cases. Rio de 
Janeiro State is in second place with 6,208 cases.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Roberto de Souza Queiroz: "AIDS Now Kills </F>
More Than Traffic in Sao Paulo"; introductory paragraph in 
italics as published] 
  [Text] A survey reveals that the disease caused 684 
deaths between April and June of last year. 
  Deaths from AIDS in the capital already account for an 
absolute majority of all deaths caused by reportable diseases, 
surpassing tuberculosis, meningitis, and schistosomiasis. Now 
AIDS is also ahead of traffic deaths. It is surpassed only by 
homicides. The survey was made by the Municipal Funeral Service. 
  Experts used death certificates from April through June of 
last year for the survey. During that period, reportable 
diseases were responsible for 940 deaths. Of that number, 684 
were attributed to AIDS, 147 to tuberculosis, 60 to meningitis, 
21 to meningococcal meningitis, 15 to schistosomiasis, seven to 
leptospirosis, and four to Hansen's disease. Tetanus and cholera 
caused one death each. 
  In a comparative survey, the study shows that while AIDS 
killed 684 persons, homicides were responsible for 991 deaths, 
traffic accidents 447, other accidents 383, and suicides and 
self-inflicted injuries 98. Other external causes were 
responsible for 182 deaths. 
  Although concerned by the percentage increase in deaths due 
to AIDS, which rose from 3.5 percent in 1991 to 4.1 percent in 
1993, the Funeral Service notes that as far as general mortality 
is concerned, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of 
death: 36 percent of Sao Paulo City's residents die of heart 
disease, 15 percent die of cancer, and about 14 percent die of 
diseases of the respiratory tract. In fourth place are deaths 
due to external causes, which include homicide and accidents and 
are responsible for approximately 10 percent of all deaths. 
  The report says that there is still a great deal of 
prejudice 
regarding AIDS -- so much so that 15 percent of the cases are 
discovered only after investigation based on the death 
certificate. This is because the physician, generally at the 
request of the family, reports the cause of death as an 
opportunistic infection rather than AIDS. Epidemiologists, made 
suspicious by the fact that a person died in his or her 
productive years, contact the physician and then confirm that it 
was in fact an AIDS case.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The latest Health Ministry bulletin on 
AIDS, released yesterday, shows that during December, 810 new 
cases of the disease were recorded in Brazil. Between November 
and December, the number of cases in Rio de Janeiro rose 9.3 
percent, increasing from 218 to 238 newly reported. As a result, 
in December Rio surpassed Sao Paulo, which had 179 cases 
reported. 
  The coordinator of the Health Ministry's AIDS Program, Lair 
Guerra, announced yesterday that, at the end of this month, 
during a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting in Geneva, 
Switzerland, Brazil will make arrangements to conduct tests of a 
prototype vaccine against AIDS among Brazilian volunteers. 
According to Lair Guerra, the vaccine will be tested as early as 
this year in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. In Rio, there has 
been an increase in the number of cases reported, in comparison 
with the rest of the country. 
  Lair Guerra explained: "The product of the American 
laboratory, United Biomedical Incorporation (UBI), was selected, 
because it produces antibodies against the AIDS virus, and shows 
a low toxicity index." She added that there is no effective 
vaccine in the world against the disease yet. 
  Also to be discussed at the Geneva meeting is the method for 
recruiting the 24 Brazilian volunteers: persons not infected 
with the virus, whose names will be kept confidential. UBI will 
allocate $100 million for the tests, which will be carried out 
by the School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas 
Gerais, and the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio. 
  Lair Guerra reported that one of the advantages of the 
vaccine, which has already been tested in the United States, and 
is in the implementation phase in Thailand, China, and 
Australia, is that it includes the types of virus currently 
circulating in Brazil. 
  On 28 March, UBI representatives will be in Brasilia to 
discuss the budgeting and implementation of the program. Brazil 
was one of the countries selected for the test because it is the 
fourth-ranking nation in numbers of AIDS cases. According to the 
Health Ministry, 45,859 cases of the disease were reported 
between 1980 and 1993. The Southeast region recorded 66.2 
percent of the total AIDS cases in December; Rio de Janeiro had 
a sharp increase from 20.1 to 29.4 percent of the total; and Sao 
Paulo showed a decline from 48.5 to 22.1 percent.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- AIDS is the primary cause of death 
among women in the 20-35 year age bracket in Sao Paulo, 
according to a survey just completed by the State Data Analysis 
System (Seade) Foundation, an agency specializing in 
socioeconomic research. According to the survey, during 1992 
AIDS killed 524 women in this age group throughout the state. 
  The number represents 11.87 percent of the total deaths 
(4,412) recorded among the female population that year. The 
second cause of death after AIDS was tumors (468 fatalities). It 
was followed by vehicle accidents (370 cases), homicides (275), 
and pneumonia (194). 
  The problem is serious among men as well. According to the 
survey, during 1992 AIDS was the second cause of death among the 
male population aged between 20 and 35 years (2,289 fatalities). 
Homicides ranked first (4,314 deaths). 
  The 1993 figures are still being tabulated by the 
foundation's researchers. However, based on the records analyzed 
to date, AIDS continues to lead in the causes of death among 
women. 
  Demographer Antonio Marangone Camargo claimed: "There is a 
rising trend in the number of deaths due to AIDS among this 
population." 
  The progression in the numbers of deaths caused by AIDS has 
been observed by the Seade technicians for at least three years. 
In 1990, the deaths due to the disease among women aged between 
20 and 24 years accounted for 7.58 percent of the deaths 
recorded in the state. During 1991, the proportion rose to 10.61 
percent; and, in 1992, it reached 12.50 percent. 
  Despite the alarming indexes, the specialists are not 
frightened. For example, Caio Rosenthal, a physician 
specializing in the study of infections at the Emilio Ribas 
Institute of Infection Studies, claimed that the rising trend in 
the number of deaths caused by AIDS among young women had 
already been anticipated. 
  Rosenthal explained: "They comprise a sexually active 
population with less sexual stability, using drugs, and with 
behavior considered to be risky. It was predictable that this 
would ocurr, because we are in a country where there is no care 
for health, or family planning, and where the condom is one of 
the most expensive in the world."

  [Text] New cases of hog cholera has been detected in the 
provinces of Pinar del Rio, La Havana, Havana City, and part of 
Matanzas. 
  As the first signs were detected a few months ago, the 
Veterinarian Institute warned about the dangers of transferring 
pigs or pork within those affected areas. This institute has 
also banned the unauthorized transfer of pigs from those 
provinces to the rest of the country. The control must be 
strengthened to quickly detect possible new cases and to 
facilitate the vaccination of pigs in each zone, municipality, 
or province, according to the planned program of priorities.

  [Text] During recent weeks there has been a dangerous 
increase in the number of cases of malaria, or paludism, in 
Ferrenafe Province, located 18 km northeast of Chiclayo. Nearly 
50 patients suffering from this disease were reported during 
November. 
  As a spokesman for the Regional Health Directorate 
announced, 
the inhabitants hardest hit by this disease are from the 
districts of Pueblo Nuevo, Pitipo, and Mesones Muro, and also 
from the populated centers of La Traposa, Laquipampa, and Senor 
de la Justicia. 
  He revealed that all the cases involve malignant malaria, 
and 
that the majority are persons living in the rural section of 
Ferrenafe. 
  The source remarked that people engaged in agricultural work 
and in contact with the countryside are most prone to contract 
this disease, because farming areas are considered a habitat for 
its vector, namely, the anopheles mosquito. 
  He claimed that Ferrenafe's chief problem is the lack of 
medical care for all its inhabitants, because the health sector 
has only one properly equipped establishment, which must treat 
all the residents comprising the province. 
  He explained that there are many districts with small 
medical 
stations and health centers, but none of them have medicines or 
medical professionals. Hence, those stricken have been evacuated 
to the city itself.

  [Text] Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne announced that 
precautions have been taken to prevent propagation from a case 
of hemorrhagic (or type II) dengue, a disease that has occurred 
in the country for the first time. He claimed that it could 
prove lethal if the necessary measures are not adopted. 
  He explained that classic dengue (type I), caused by the 
bite 
of the anopheles mosquito that transmits the disease, is common, 
primarily in the jungle and in certain northern zones. No cases 
of the "hemorrhagic" type or of type III, which are extremely 
serious diseases, had ever been reported. He noted that orders 
have been issued to fumigate the habitats and to send medicines 
for treatment. 
  Those stricken with hemorrhagic dengue show not only bodily 
illness and high fever, symptoms of the so-called "classic" 
type, but also hemorrhages of various origins. Hence, as he 
explained, treatment based on consumption of liquids and blood 
transfusions is necessary. 
<H5>  Dengue Arrived in 1953 </H5>
  If a chronology is made, it may be claimed that epidemics of 
simple dengue were first reported in the country during 1953 and 
1958. Later, in 1990, there were isolated outbreaks in the 
cities of Iquitos, Tarapoto, and Pucallpa. 
  During 1991, new cases were reported in the locality of 
Pachanaqui (Junin); and in 1992, in Zorritos (Lambayeque). 
  During 1993, 80 cases were recorded in Sullana; 270 in 
Tarapoto alone; 34 in Junin; 34 in the Grau region; 177 in 
Loreto; 37 in San Martin; and 27 in Ucayali. During the week of 
5-11 December, four cases were reported in Tarapoto. 
<H5>  Tuberculosis and Cholera </H5>
  The health minister made these statements before signing an 
agreement with the minister of the Presidency, Manuel Vara 
Ochoa; the director of Foncodes [National Compensation and 
Social Development Fund], Arturo Woodman; and the representative 
of the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), Luis Loyola. Its 
purpose is to carry out a program of prevention, control, and 
treatment for tuberculosis patients among populations at risk in 
Lima and Callao. 
  He asserted that the incidence of TB has declined, and that, 
if this continues, it would mean that progress has been made in 
early diagnosis and public treatment with basic medications. 
<H5>  Statistics in Lima and Callao </H5>
  The official statistics show that, in Lima and Callao, there 
were 26,200 cases in 1992 and 24,800 in 1993. Last year, 55,500 
patients were reported throughout the country; and this year, 
the figure was 54,000. 
  It was indicated that the treatment program, costing 
2,799,852 soles, will benefit 12,500 TB patients, who will be 
admitted to the Health Ministry's 568 establishments during 1994.

  [Text] Pucallpa, 14 Dec -- The vice minister of health, Dr. 
Eduardo Yong Motta, claimed: "The incidence of cholera in our 
country at present, compared with the cases that appeared in 
1991 and 1992, has declined over 75 percent. This is due to the 
fact that the population is taking care of its health." 
  He emphasized: "If the population continues to adopt 
preventive measures of a hygienic and sanitary type, we shall 
soon be able to state that cholera has been eradicated." 
  He stressed the importance of reiterating certain measures, 
such as boiling water, protecting water supplies by chlorinating 
them, washing fruits and vegetables, washing hands, and others. 
<H5>  1994 Budget </H5>
  He also reported that the Ministry of Economy and Finance 
has 
expressed an interest in supporting the Health Ministry, by 
increasing the 1994 budget by 700,000 new soles. He explained 
that this will enable the sector to deal more easily with the 
health problems on the national level, especially those 
associated with infectious-contagious diseases. 
  Yong preferred not to comment on the suspension of the state 
employees' registration in the AFP [Pension Fund Associations] 
ordered by the government. He remarked: "That comes under the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, not the 
Health Ministry. I think that the measure should be analyzed and 
assessed in its entirety, with the necessary good judgment, by 
those who have issued these orders." 
  Yong Motta was in this city to inspect the status of the 
Health Ministry's services in Pucallpa, and to coordinate 
measures with the pertinent authorities. 
<H5>  Health Policy </H5>
  With the regional health director, Antonio Mundini Medrano, 
he toured various settlements in the rural and riverside areas, 
coordinating national health policy action that must be 
implemented on the regional level. 
  According to the report, they also inspected the health 
stations and centers, to assess the possibility of transferring 
them to the future private health service organizations (OSS).

  [Text] Arequipa, 22 Dec -- A total of 143 persons stricken 
with cholera were hospitalized in the Arequipa Region during the 
week of 5-11 December; and half of them were cases detected in 
the coastal provinces of Camana and Islay. This announcement was 
made by the coordinator of the Regional Health Directorate, Dr. 
Miguel Alayza Angles. 
  The specialist noted that the current statistics are still 
being compiled, but revealed that they show an obvious decline 
from the number of cases that appeared in mid-October. During 
that period, as many as 270 patients showed up infected with 
vibrio cholerae. 
  Alayza Angles explained that the reduction in the number of 
persons stricken by the epidemic in this locality is due to the 
prevention campaigns conducted by the health sector in the 
city's peripheral areas. It is also a result of the good work 
done by the care-giving personnel, immediately treating persons 
who arrive at hospitals with symptoms characteristic of the 
disease. 
  He claimed that the battle against another outbreak of 
cholera in Arequipa has been won thus far with the resident's 
cooperation. For this purpose, strict hygienic measures have 
been recommended, as well as the boiling of drinking water, and 
the avoidance of consuming products sold by street vendors. 
  Alayza Angles remarked: "Nevertheless, people must not be 
over-confident, and must continue taking precautions that will 
enable them to avoid becoming infected with the disease." 
  He observed that, for the present, the medicines sent by the 
Health Ministry are sufficing to administer the treatment 
required by cholera patients. However, he pointed out the need 
for providing a larger supply of medications to the Camana and 
Islay hospitals.

<F P=106> [Article: "Sounding the Alarm: Diphtheria Epidemic Spreads </F>
in Wilaya"] 
  [Text] All health sectors are now affected, with a total of 
100 cases reported, including 40 bacteriologically confirmed, 
and six deaths. The health services have also treated 80 healthy 
carriers (infected, but not seriously enough to develop the 
malady). 
  Patients are being hospitalized in the 30-bed "infectious 
disease" ward. And to accommodate new cases, an additional 30 
beds may be shifted from the "psychiatric" ward of the Tizi 
Ouzou CHU [university hospital center]. Also, it was decided to 
open isolation wards at Azazga, Draa El Mizan, Tigzirt, Ain El 
Hammam, and Larbaa Nath Irathen. Healthy carriers are examined 
and treated with antibiotics in their homes, thanks to mobile 
disease prevention squads responsible for checking other members 
of households where the disease has struck. The purpose of these 
activities, according to Dr. Bourbia, director of pedagogical 
and medical services at the Tizi Ouzou CHU, is to "diminish or 
arrest transmission of the germ, which is directly communicated 
-- this can't be repeated too often -- from person to person 
(interhuman transmission)." It should be noted that cases have 
been reported thus far in Beni Douala, Ain El Hammam, Ouacif, 
Azeffoun, Ath Zmenzer, Boghni, Draa ben Khedda, and in the chief 
town of the wilaya. 
  It has also been learned that the director of preventive 
services has hurriedly dispatched a delegation from the Health 
Ministry to Tizi Ouzou to confer with the antidiphtheria 
committee recently formed in that town's CHU. Besides 
participating in a day-long diphtheria public awareness program 
to be held on 20 January at the paramedic school, the team from 
the ministry "has given us assurances concerning regular 
provisions of vaccines and serums," Dr. Bourbia said. 
  For example, a shipment of 5,000 doses of vaccine and 
antidiphtheria serum has been delivered. It was also recommended 
that diphtheria patients be referred to El-Kettar hospital, 
which specializes in treatment of infectious diseases. 
  We note last that health personnel, patient associations, 
and 
the press have all been urged to work for the success of the 
public awareness program this Thursday. Meanwhile, the dread 
disease is gaining ground.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Debbache: "Sour El-Ghozlane: 67 Typhoid Cases </F>
Confirmed"] 
  [Text] In the last two weeks, public health authorities in 
Sour El-Ghozlane have reported numerous cases of typhoid. Out of 
more than 80 reported cases, 67 have been confirmed by 
laboratory analysis, and these alone are enough to constitute a 
veritable epidemic -- to the great distress of local 
inhabitants, some of whom are close to panic. The first case was 
reported on 27 December 1993. To deal with the situation, public 
health workers have mobilized personnel and equipment resources 
commensurate with the threat. Two wards -- one for men and the 
other for women -- have been reserved on the third floor of the 
hospital, under strict isolation procedures. The pediatric ward 
is overcrowded and looks more like a day nursery than a hospital 
ward, but the important thing is that tests and proper care are 
being administered. The hardest part is still ahead, because if 
wider contagion is to be prevented, the source of contamination 
will have to be identified and eliminated. Some observers blame 
the poor water treatment facilities, others the decrepit state 
of water mains vulnerable to contamination from waste water, 
while still others point to the whey sold in the street in 
plastic containers exposed to the open air. In any case, and as 
a preventive measure, the sale of whey in plastic sacks has been 
suspended temporarily, while the churns used by small producers 
to make the whey have been idled. In addition to identification 
and eventual elimination of the loci of contamination, an 
extensive vaccination drive has been launched at the community 
and even the family level. Visits have been paid to Dachemia and 
Bordj Okhris, where suspected cases have been reported. 
  Also, with the appearance of diphtheria cases in the wilaya, 
steps have been taken to arrest this scourge. It should be noted 
that the reappearance of diphtheria after its eradication more 
than 15 years ago signals a certain fall-off in the vaccination 
program. All of which serves to emphasize the high priority that 
must be given to dissemination of information and to general 
public awareness campaigns. Also, we noted during our visit the 
large number of medical personnel on hand, including Dr. Garti 
himself.

said Head of the Committee for Campaign Against AIDS Dr. Emami 
here Wednesday. 
  Turning to the geographical dispersal of the affected people 
in Iran, he said the virus has contaminated people in northern 
parts of the country mostly through blood transfusion whereas in 
southern parts it has been transferred through sexual relations. 
  He said an average of 5,000 people have moved in and out of 
the country every day, adding that since two years ago and 
through cooperation of the Iranian Foreign Ministry all 
foreigners arriving in the country will pass through HIV test. 
  He underlined the need for a nationwide education program 
and 
said the committee receives latest scientific data on the 
disease and put the information at the disposal of universities 
and other higher education institutes in the country.

October. This incident took place two months before the 
international AIDS day when the media were informing people all 
around the world about this fatal disease. The effort of this 
Karachi patient to commit suicide is considered an example of 
the lack of education in Pakistan. Both people and AIDS patients 
are careless about this deadly disease. The Karachi lady was 
found by a relative who had come there by chance for a visit and 
saved her life. This woman had seen two members of her family 
die. The bad luck of this woman began when her drug addict 
husband learned he had the deadly virus. In 1986 it was 
confirmed that this woman's husband had that poisonous virus, 
and he finally died of it. He had transferred the deadly virus 
to his wife and eight-year-old son before he died. A bigger 
problem than this is that our society does not accept AIDS 
patients, and the public attitude toward AIDS patients is very 
hostile and deplorable. Mr. Shaukat Ali, a social worker helping 
AIDS patients, said that it is important to look after AIDS 
patients; however, no attention is given to them. The people do 
not know much about the HIV positive condition; although, it is 
very dangerous. According to Dr. Sayyed Abdulmajib, the tendency 
to commit suicide by AIDS patients is the same around the world, 
and to reduce their suicide rate we must pay attention to them. 
People should change their attitude. They should know that the 
AIDS virus is not transferred by shaking hands or kissing, and 
AIDS patients cannot transfer this sickness to another. No part 
of the world is safe from this peril and its only solution is 
education. There is no cure for it. This disease came to 
Pakistan seven years ago. The number of patients is increasing 
continuously here, and it has tripled now. The number of HIV 
patients has reached 251 now, while in 1991 there were only 90 
patients.

  [Text] Khakassia -- An unprecedentedly severe epidemic of 
influenza has broken out in the Khakassian capital Abakan. The 
number of people infected already runs into thousands, exceeding 
the usual seasonal indicators many times over. Following an 
initiative by the city's sanitary and epidemiological 
supervision center, practically all the city's secondary schools 
have been closed down as a quarantine measure, and store 
assistants are going around in gauze masks. Experts believe 
that the influenza virus which has taken hold in Abakan is 
extremely dangerous and that the illness can have serious 
consequences.

  [Text] On 23 December the nightly news broadcast of the 
television channel Ostankino sounded the bad news that 58 
persons suffering from diphtheria have been hospitalized in 
Sakhalin and that two persons have already died. The military 
recruits that had been on the island were mentioned as one 
apparent source of the infection. 
  As Mikhail Ketrar, colonel of the medical service and chief 
sanitary inspector of the Far Eastern Military District, noted, 
all 81 persons in the autumn call-up had been vaccinated against 
diphtheria before being sent to Sakhalin. At the present time 
there is not one case of this disease among military personnel 
of the Sakhalin garrison. These facts have also been confirmed 
by Yuriy Stiplin, chief state sanitary inspector of the Sakhalin 
Oblast.

  [Text] Outbreaks of diphtheria have been noted in a number 
of cities in Sakhalin. In Nevelsk, for example, eight cases of 
the disease have been recorded, and two patients have died in 
Kholmsk. The epidemiological services fear that the isolated 
diphtheria foci may develop into an epidemic. The problem is 
that in the past few years the public has not received 
vaccinations and preventive medical examinations have been put 
on the back burner. All of this has resulted in a weakening of 
the adult population's immunity. Emergency vaccination of people 
on the island has begun. Those who have not been vaccinated are 
not allowed to work. Emergency epidemiological commissions are 
in operation in the cities. Physicians have become involved in 
the defense against diphtheria. The problem is that there is not 
enough serum.

<F P=106> [Article by Lev Markovich Portnoy, Doctor of Medical </F>
Sciences, Professor, Head of the Roentgenological Department of 
the M. F. Vladimirsky Moscow Oblast Clinical Scientific Research 
Institute; under the title: The Second Coming of Tuberculosis] 
  [Text] A relatively quiet tuberculosis situation with 
periodic outbursts of this disease, which were being 
successfully handled by the previously created powerful 
antituberculosis service, with its fine staffs and network of 
regional, city, and oblast (kray) antituberculosis dispensaries, 
characterizes recent years. And we had become accustomed to this 
situation. 
  But today, suddenly, but perhaps not so unexpectedly, taking 
the difficult situation in the country into account, the 
tuberculosis situation has become acute. Not for nothing; after 
all it is, as we have emphasized, a social disease. And even the 
mass media, with the whipping up that is characteristic of them, 
exaggerate the danger of the new incursion of tuberculosis, the 
possibility of its causing trouble in the very new future cannot 
in any way be excluded. There are, to a certain degree, 
additional preconditions for it in the person of a clearly 
weakening state medicine. 
  Without in any way disputing the situation in the country 
that predisposes to tuberculosis, I believe that the simple 
repetition of measures, proven in the past, directed to the 
campaign against this malady, must not be permitted. Times today 
are different, medicine has different possibilities, and the 
general situational background is not what it was after the war. 
  By the way, observing the way in which our organizational 
structures are beginning to act, it is difficult to get away 
from the impression of a patent duplication of the methods of 
fighting against tuberculosis that were used in the remote 
postwar years. To substantiate what I am saying, I would like to 
cite the photo-fluorography situation in our public health 
system as an example. 
  Certainly, no one will dispute the fact that in the campaign 
against the tuberculosis epidemic in the war-turn country, 
photo-fluorography did in fact have great significance. A fairly 
good material and technological base for those years was 
created. The service worked in close contact with the 
phthisiatric (antituberculosis) service. In essence, the former 
was organizationally subordinate to the latter. It can be stated 
that in those years photo-fluorography was one of the principal 
actors among the RparticipantsS in the successful attack on 
tuberculosis. 
  Years past; tuberculosis took up its usual place in the 
overall structure of morbidity. But, the powerful 
antituberculosis and photo-fluorographic services continued to 
operate, without changing their habits, under conditions of 
active combat situation. 
  And meanwhile, the overall medical situation changed, 
including the tuberculosis situation. And tuberculosis itself 
learned how to oppose the forces acting on it more stubbornly, 
and its geography changed sharply. But the main thing was that 
scientific and technical progress provided medicine with many 
new technologies, making it possible to look differently on the 
possibilities of diagnosis overall, and the diagnosis of 
pulmonary tuberculosis in particular. 
  Entirely new views appeared on the problem of the 
fundamental 
improvement of the campaign against the so-called mass diseases, 
by means of the formation of risk groups, first of all, and by 
the development of the corresponding diagnostic models for their 
early identification, in the second place. Finally, the same 
scientific and technical progress forced a change in the 
attitude toward the problems of radiation burdens in the case of 
the so-called prophylactic examinations by means of radiographic 
diagnosis, and, of photo-fluorography, in the first place. It is 
entirely natural that against this background as a whole, the 
antituberculosis medical organizational structures of today 
require obligatory correction. And this relates above all to the 
photo-fluorographic service. 
  Formed nearly half a century ago, it has remained today in 
essence in the same organizational-methodological positions of 
half a century back. The first of these is the constant striving 
to cover the entire healthy population by mass prophylactic 
photo-fluorographic examinations. Orders and various normative 
documents, new rules of the Ministry of Health regarding the 
conduct of such examinations are constantly coming out. But they 
all in essence fail to take into account the true state of 
affairs, and have been produced clearly simply to take away the 
acuteness of the problem and to preserve the old organizational 
forms of the entire antituberculosis organizational complex. 
  Photo-fluorographic technology, at the same time, which now 
literally saturates the polyclinic network, also requires its 
own improvement. The method of examination in which the 
physician of the photo-fluorographic office in essence knows 
nothing about the patient, since communication with him is 
precluded, today clearly does not respond to the new criteria. 
Nothing, practically, has been decided about the questions of 
the completing of the examination, if the physician considers it 
necessary to carry out a number of supplementary procedures. Of 
course, in the post-war years such an organizational plan 
corresponded to the spirit of the times; today it is simply 
morally obsolete. In this way a lousy situation has been 
created; subsequently it has been expanding in the form of 
todays system of mass prophylactic examinations of the 
populations. 
  Specialists in radiation safety see in this one of the 
causes 
of the general increase in radiation exposure of the healthy 
population. Oncologists, believing that such a system of 
examination is one of the factors influencing the increase in 
the frequency of oncological diseases, join them in this 
opinion. But, the antituberculosis service which, as we have 
stated, is very powerful, remains as unshakeable as a rock, 
arguing the necessity of such examinations. Of course, we can 
understand it, since it is very difficult to part with a 
habitual stance, which such indices as mass scope, convenient 
for reporting, underlie. And this means, large figures, millions 
of patients - consequently, a high volume of work accomplished... 
  Today, I dare say, the structure of the photo-fluorographic 
service does not meet the requirements for screening, mass 
diagnostic examinations. Under no circumstances should, I 
believe, photo-fluorography be made a principal participant of 
the planned antituberculosis campaign. Otherwise we risk loosing 
it. Why? First, the existing system for carrying out mass 
prophylactic examinations is impracticable. Second, even after 
it is corrected, it will be effective only if all of the 
structures of the antituberculosis service are changed 
concurrently. If we take into account that some of the serious 
sources of tuberculosis are places of incarceration. If we take 
into account pharmaceutical shortages. If we don't forget about 
the appearance of a new class in this country, persons of no 
fixed address [bomzhi]. And about many other factors. It is 
these in particular which make the activation of tuberculosis 
possible. 
  To make todays mass photo-fluorographic examinations with 
coverage the main prop in the campaign against tuberculosis 
means, in our opinion, throwing wide the gates of our life to 
tuberculosis. 
  Well, then what shall we do with photo-fluorography? 
Completely exclude it from the campaign methods? Not at all. 
Just the opposite. We must make use of the quite abundant 
polyclinic network of photo-fluorographic machines and the 
organizational structure of this service. But, to eliminate as 
much as possible all of todays negatives relating to 
photo-fluorography, its efficiency must be increased. And this 
means that it is literally necessary to combine 
photo-fluorography as a part of roentgenology with it in all 
respects. And not so formalistically as today. Freeing the 
office physicians from warrying about coverage is the job of the 
directors of the organizational-methodological divisions of the 
dispensaries. In the process, the mere description of those 
disastrous one-plate photo-fluorograms of the lungs must not 
fall within the duties of the photo-fluorographic office 
physicians. Today they cannot remain simply picture-takers. We 
should think seriously about increasing the size of the 
photo-fluorographic frame to 100 mm. Our experience tells us 
that the resolving capacity of photo-fluorography in general is 
sharply increased in the process. 
  And if one is to think seriously about a new approach, then 
it is also necessary to switch over in practical public health 
to digital photo-fluorography. The leading firms that are 
manufacturing apparatuses for radiological diagnosis are now 
moving precisely in that direction. In that case, incidentally, 
the accusations of the threat of radiation burdens on the 
patient will no longer be valid. 
  But this is for the future; at the moment, first and 
foremost, it is necessary to shift to differentiated 
photo-fluorographic diagnostic examinations of tuberculosis risk 
groups; the contemporary approach to their formation should be 
taken as their basis. This is also important in connection with 
calls for the prohibition of photo-fluorography altogether 
because of radiation burdens on the popuation. 
  Our proposals are not the fruit of theoretical reflections, 
but the product of many years of experience of the M. F. 
Vladimirsky Moscow Oblast Clinical Scientific Research Institute 
[MONIKI] in carrying out the differentiated comprehensive 
roentgenofluorographic diagnostic examination of risk groups for 
a number of the principal pulmonary diseases, including 
tuberculosis. Our data attest to the effectiveness of this 
approach, such as, for example, in differentiated 
photo-fluorography among detected cases of pulmonary 
tuberculosis (and there are no small number of them), the 
majority of the patients had undergone preliminary 
photo-fluorographic examination through the existing system and 
the so-called prophylactic photo-fluorography, under which 
tuberculosis had not been detected. 
  All the considerations presented in this article flow from 
many years of experience of exclusively professional dealings 
with patients ill with various lung diseases, including 
tuberculosis. Perhaps our public health organizers will also 
discover what is useful in them. Although I can very well 
imagine that the reaction to todays printed word will be very 
insubstantial.

<F P=106> [Article by David Fletcher: "Fifty percent of All Hospitals </F>
`Run Short of Money'"] 
  [Text] More than half of all hospitals have experienced 
such severe financial problems in the past year that they have 
been forced to close wards or exceed their budget, the 
Association of Community Health Councils says today. 
  In a report assessing the impact of the health reforms, it 
says they have brought both benefits and disadvantages for 
patients. 
  On the negative side: 
  -- One in three hospitals has had to slow down the number of 
patients being admitted because of cash problems. 
  -- Patients of non-fundholding GP's have found they cannot 
get into hospital as quickly as fundholders' patients. 
  On the positive side: 
  -- Waiting times to get into hospital have shortened. 
  -- Fears that patients would have to travel further as the 
internal market developed have proved unfounded. 
  The report is unable to reach clear-cut conclusions about 
the 
overall benefit of the reforms. 
  It says: "Opinion is divided among community health councils 
about the impact of the reforms on the quality of care 
delivered. Some feel purchasers and GP's are more able to insist 
on higher standards. Others feel patient care is being 
compromised by cost-cutting and staff demoralisation." 
  The report adds that there is little evidence of 
non-fundholding GP's having to change referral patterns to fit 
the contracts made by their health authorities. 
  In contrast, "fundholding GP's are revealed as the most 
dynamic and disruptive sector of the NHS internal market. 
Thirty-eight percent of CHC's say local hospitals have lost 
patients because of fundholders. They have sent their patients 
to private hospitals or to other NHS hospitals. 
  "Fundholders' patients can get better treatment, sometimes 
at 
the expense of other NHS patients. One in five CHC's report that 
fundholders' patients get priority access to local hospitals." 
  Great difficulties have resulted from hospitals facing too 
much demand without purchasers having funds to match, says the 
report.

"NHS Reforms `Getting Out of Control' Warns Report"] 
  [Text] One in three major hospitals, including recently 
formed trust hospitals, will be forced to close or amalgamate 
within seven years, says a report by independent analysts on the 
future of the NHS. 
  "By the end of the decade the current shape of the NHS will 
be largely unrecognisable," says the report, issued today by 
Newchurch and Company, an independent business development 
organisation. 
  It says the upheaval in the reorganisation of London 
hospitals will come to be regarded as no more than "modest 
change" and will be repeated in all big cities. 
  "Whatever the merits of the Government's 1991 reforms, they 
have set in train a process of restructuring which will affect 
every facet of UK health care," adds the report. 
  "It is a process that may now be beyond the powers of 
politicians and policy makers to control." 
  The report argues that the growth of day treatment, the 
introduction of keyhole surgery, the fall in length of hospital 
stays and the shift to out-patient care was already leading to a 
need for fewer hospital beds. This over-capacity is now being 
exposed as competition between hospitals, introduced by the 
Government's NHS reforms, begins to bite. 
  "Forces unleashed by the reforms are acting as a catalyst 
for 
other, wider pressures, and have set off a train of events which 
will lead inevitably to a rapid and fundamental redefinition in 
the who, how, and where of health care delivery. 
  "These trends will particularly affect NHS trusts, many of 
which will have to face sometimes unpalatable decisions about 
how they function." 
  The report says trust hospitals have substantial additional 
management costs and estimates that trust status adds at least 
&pound;250,000 a year to running costs. "For some trusts, the 
economic pressures will prove terminal." 
  District general hospitals, currently serving a population 
of 
about 200,000, will be expected to serve up to 500,000. "The 
workload of the acute hospital could expand by between 50-100 
percent."

"`Daft' Waiting Time Fines for Hospitals"] 
  [Text] Hospitals are being fined for failing to treat 
patients within the waiting time limits set by the Patient's 
Charter, under an initiative introduced without publicity by the 
Department of Health. 
  The department is imposing cash penalties equivalent to the 
cost of the operation that has not taken place -- though the 
patient still has to be treated. 
  The scheme was condemned last night as nonsensical by 
critics 
who questioned how a hospital failing to meet government 
performance criteria could be helped by punishment which further 
weakened it. 
  David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: "You 
couldn't get dafter if you really tried." 
  Under the charter, no patient should wait more than two 
years 
for any procedure. Since April, this limit has been cut to 18 
months for cataract, hip and knee operations. 
  Latest official data show more than a million people in 
England waiting for hospital admission at the end of June, of 
whom 65,465 had been waiting more than a year -- a rise of 15.6 
percent in three months. 
  The penalty system applies to funds distributed under the 
department's waiting list programme. 
  This money is allocated centrally, irrespective of the 
health 
service market, for local health authorities to tackle long 
treatment queues. 
  If monitoring reveals that a patient has been waiting longer 
than the appropriate charter limit, the department claws back 
&pound;4,000 in the case of a knee operation, &pound;3,600 for a 
hip 
or &pound;900 for any other procedure. 
  The money is taken from the regional health authority 
concerned which then docks it from the relevant district 
authority or the hospital concerned, depending on which is 
deemed responsible for the failure. 
  A hospital may still be required to do the operation or the 
patient may be placed elsewhere -- but, in either case, the 
funding is lost. 
  The fines may, moreover, be increased by the regional 
authority. The South West Thames region is adding a &pound;1,000 
"administration fee" for every month that a patient goes over 
the limit. 
  A hospital with a patient waiting 20 months for a knee 
operation would therefore be fined &pound;6,000. 
  A spokeswoman for South West Thames said it had so far fined 
Worthing district authority for one patient and Croydon for two, 
with the penalty being passed on to Mayday hospital in the 
Croydon district in at least one case. 
  According to the department, the scheme has been agreed by 
regional managers. A spokesman said it had been well accepted as 
a reasonable and effective sanction against low performers. 
  "The logic of it is that if they do fail on commitments the 
whole of the health service has signed up to, then they know 
they are going to incur the penalty," the spokesman said. 
  Mr. Blunkett said: "This is the kind of nonsense which 
arises 
from applying market forces to a caring service, which will 
result in the NHS penalising those at the sharp end for failings 
in the system and for under-resourcing. 
  "There is a danger of a spiralling downwards where financial 
penalties result in further failings to achieve targets, fewer 
operations and ever increasing waiting lists."

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Yves Nau: ``New Cholera Strain Spreading in </F>
Several Asian Countries - Responsible for Several Epidemics''] 
  [Excerpts] In Paris, the latest issue of the BULLETIN 
EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE DE LA DIRECTION GENERALE DE LA SANTE (No. 29 
1993) reports the emergence of a new cholera strain responsible 
for recent epidemics in various Asian countries. 
  Several epidemics of choleraic syndromes -- vomiting, 
diarrhea, more or less serious dehydration -- have appeared in 
India and Bangladesh since the end of 1992. At the time of the 
first of these epidemics, in Madras, specialists were able to 
isolate a germ in patients that did not correspond to any of 
those known to cause cholera. This strain differed from 
Vibrio cholerae 01, the microorganism that causes 
epidemic cholera, and from the other species of 
Vibrio that can cause similar gastrointestinal 
infections. 
  It was then found that this microorganism is capable of 
producing a choleraic toxin and that it is resistant to numerous 
medicines, with the exception of some antibiotics such as 
tetracycline. Around the beginning of this year, a new strain 
caused a severe cholera epidemic in south Bangladesh (10,000 
cases and 500 deaths). A new epidemic occurred from January to 
April, this time in Calcutta (13,000 cases and 400 deaths), 
striking adults in particular and leading to very severe 
dehydration and blood disorders in patients. 
  It is evident from these indications that a new toxic and 
virulent strain has emerged in the last few months from the 
endemic Asiatic focus of cholera. It has now been named 
Vibrio cholerae 0139 or ``Bengal.'' Unlike the other 
previously known colonies, it directly threatens the entire 
population. 
  Its progression is very rapid, spreading as it did from 
south 
India to east India in just a few weeks. ``This new 
Vibrio will very probably spread in Asia and to other 
parts, affecting first of all the most indigent. International 
monitoring of the spread of this new strain must therefore be 
intensified,'' the General Directorate of Health, in Paris, 
points out.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Yves Nau: ``The New Cholera Strain Has </F>
Reached Thailand and China''] 
  [Text] The cholera strain known as 0139 (or ``Bengal''), 
responsible for a new type of epidemic in south and east India, 
then in Bangladesh (LE MONDE 15-16 August), is progressing very 
rapidly over the Asiatic continent, where it has already 
affected thousands of persons and has caused several hundred 
deaths. It has now reached Thailand and China. 
  Isolated a short time ago, Vibrio cholerae 0139 
appears particularly toxic and virulent. Unlike the other 
colonies, it threatens the population as a whole, and in 
particular, adults from Asiatic countries where cholera is 
endemically rampant. The French General Directorate of Health's 
weekly epidemiologic bulletin's prediction that the new strain 
would probably spread among the ``most indigent'' populations, 
has in fact materialized. On Monday 16 August, according to the 
AFP, Chinese health authorities reported some 100 cholera cases 
due to Vibrio cholerae 0139 in Sinkiang, in the 
western part of the country. As of last month, the Chinese 
minister of health had already reported atypical cases of 
cholera in the southern part of the country. The emergence of 
this new strain and its rapid spread worry international 
epidemiologists. In a commentary published in the British weekly 
THE LANCET dated 14 August, Doctors David L. Swerdlow of Boston, 
and Allen A. Ries of Atlanta, fear that this phenomenon will 
result in the eighth pandemic of cholera. Each of the previous 
pandemics resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality 
rates, notably in Africa and Latin America. [passage omitted] 
  ``Although we may not be able to foretell where and how fast 
this new strain will spread, countries must surveil it closely 
and permanently,'' the American specialists stress in THE 
LANCET. This surveillance requires, in particular, that the 
third world's health officials in their entirety institute 
indispensable hygienic measures as soon as possible by supplying 
the populations at risk with only high-quality water and with 
covered sewage systems, without which the undertaking of a fight 
against cholera remains but a dramatic utopia.

disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Ethiopia </H5>
  Epidemic -- One hundred and seventeen people have died of an 
epidemic which broke out five months ago in the Keficho Zone in 
the southern Ethiopia People's Regional Administration, 
according to the head of the zonal health department, Dr. 
Habtamu Argaw. He said 607 people living in 31 kebeles 
(neighborhoods) in six districts hit by the epidemic had been 
given treatment. Though efforts have been made to contain the 
epidemic in the zone by health workers and the zonal 
administration, the epidemic had proved to be uncontainable. 
Financial, manpower, material and transport vehicle shortages 
had contributed to the failure to contain the epidemic. (Addis 
Ababa Voice of Ethiopia Network in Amharic 0400 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  Dysentery -- Eighteen people have died of dysentery in the 
past week alone in Asbulu town of Erer District in Region Five, 
according to a people's representatives there who also told the 
ETHIOPIAN NEWS AGENCY during the week that apart from people 
dying of dysentery, cattle were being forced to move out of 
settlements. The people faced severe problems due to lack of 
rainfall for the past 10 months. According to the secretary of 
the district administration, Mr. Isa Mohammad, more than 10,000 
people face famine in Hareta, Gerefle, Hardila and another seven 
kebeles and that people are dying of dysentery every day. 
(Addis Ababa Voice of Ethiopia Network in Amharic 1700 GMT 15 
Feb 94) 
<H5>  Kenya </H5>
  AIDS -- The high rate at which the acquired immune 
deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) is spreading in Kenya may cause a major decline 
in population growth, the KENYAN NEWS AGENCY (KNA) reported in 
Nairobi on Wednesday, quoting a report. The agency cited a 
newly-published report on the AIDS situation in Kenya according 
to which fertility rate is expected to drop fron 5.4 percent in 
1990-93 to 4.2 percent by the year 2000 and further down to 3.5 
percent by the year 2010. It also says that mortality resulting 
from a wide range of causes other than AIDS would decline while 
life expectancy would increase from about 57 years presently to 
67 years by the year 2010 if there were no AIDS-related deaths. 
According to the report, Kenya's population would be growing at 
the rate of 2.5 percent per annum, by the year 2000. (Dakar PANA 
in English 1253 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Vagina festula -- The vagina festula disease is in on the 
upsurge in different parts of the country. Latest statistics 
show that about 200,000 cases of the disease have been recorded 
nationwide. (Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1800 GMT 16 
Feb 94) 
<H5>  Uganda </H5>
  Diarrhea/measles -- A total of 112 Sudanese refugees in 
camps 
in north western Uganda are reported to have died of an 
assortment of diseases between 22 January to 11 February. A 
Uganda Red Cross (URC) report dated 14 February said the 
refugees died of diarrhoea, pneumonia, post measles, upper 
respiratory infections, injury, eye disease, skin disease and 
other minor infections. The report stated that the figures 
could be higher. 
  The report also talked of a riot by refugees around 
mid-January when they held four URC workers hostage for sometime 
before police rescued them. The Red Cross workers were held as 
they attempted to carry out a census to establish population of 
North Kochi and Gbenge camps. They also wanted to re-organise 
the latter as it is over crowded, the report adds. (Dakar PANA 
in English 0955 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Tanzania </H5>
  Cholera -- Eight people died in the southern Tanzania 
district of Mtwara following a severe outbreak of cholera last 
week, a senior government official said here on 14 February, 
reports PANA. About 50 people are reported to have contracted 
the killer disease and are being treated at a village health 
center in Mtwara District, southern Tanzania. 
  Cholera, which first broke out in Tanzania in 1977, has 
claimed more than 19,000 lives in the past 17 years, according 
to the Ministry of Health. The disease first broke out in 
villages along the Tanzania coast killing thousands of people 
before it was contained towards the end of 1982. However, 
despite government efforts to eradicate the cholera scourge, 
lack of drugs and poor environmental sanitation among Tanzanian 
villagers have contributed to the persistence of the disease. 
(Nairobi KNA in English 1435 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Zaire </H5>
  Trypanosomiasis -- In the Bandundu region, an outbreak of 
trypanosomiasis has been reported in the Plateau subregion. 
Lack of medicine to fight the disease has resulted in hundreds 
of people dying everyday. (Kinshasa Voix du Zaire in French 1800 
GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  AIDS -- The major religious denominations in Zaire, namely 
the Catholic Church, the Church of Christ, the Kinbangist 
Church, the Islamic community, as well as the National 
Associations of Parents of Students, have embarked upon a war 
against the use of condoms. They consider the use of a condom 
as a dangerous habit and recommend abstinence from sexual 
intercourse before marriage. ZAIRE PRESSE AGENCY reports that 
the advice was given at the end of a seminar on the role of 
schools in the fight against AIDS. It should be noted 2 million 
people tested positive in Zaire between 1985 and 1991, a figure 
that reportedly doubled at the end of last year. (Kinshasa Voix

  [Editorial Report] Following is a compilation of reports 
monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 24 to 30 January 
concerning outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items 
are listed by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Cholera/Diarrhea -- "Cabo Delgado Province has been affected 
by cholera since the last quarter of 1993. The disease which 
has spread to the districts of Chiure, Ancuabe, Montepuez, 
Palma, Metuge, and to the city of Pemba, has already killed 86 
people. Hundreds of people in the province have also been 
affected by bloody diarrhea in the province." (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 26 Jan 94) 
  Diarrhea -- "About 30 cases of diarrhea with traces of blood 
are reported in Inhassunje District, Zambezia Province every 
week. The chief district health officer says there has been an 
increase in such cases because the residents have been drinking 
untreated water. He said water wells in the district are not 
working because of faulty manual pumps." [Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Portuguese 1030 Jan 94] 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Polio -- "A countrywide inoculation campaign against polio 
and other preventable children's diseases was launched yesterday 
after polio cases, originating in Angola and affecting 
northwestern Namibia, were reported. Since the outbreak of 
polio in November, 23 cases were confirmed in the Karas, Hardap, 
Khomas, and Omaheke districts. Five out of six confirmed cases 
of acute polio in the northwest originate in Angola. The last 
confirmed polio case in the south was reported on 1 December." 
(Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in Afrikaans 25 Jan 94 p 3) 
<H5>  Zambia </H5>
  Malaria -- "The Zambian National Malaria Control Center says 
that more than 50 percent of all deaths in Zambia are caused by 
malaria. The center said in a report that about 50 percent of 
Zambians attending hospitals and clinics have been found to have 
malaria, most of these being children. It said that between 30 
and 60 percent of Zambians were carriers of the malaria 
parasite, which had flourished because of the ineffective 
enforcement of malaria control measures by the Zambian Ministry 
of Health." (Johannesburg Channel Africa Radio in English 1100

<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Cholera -- A tota1 of 115 people died of cholera in Cabo 
Delgado Province in January. More than 250 cholera cases were 
recorded, also in January, in Chiure, Ancuabe, Metuge, Palma 
Districts and the city of Pemba. The Cabo Delgado provincial 
health director says 36 people have died of bloody diarrhea, 
while about 4,000 cases of bloody diarrhea have already been 
diagnosed in the province. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Portuguese 1730 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  Diarrhea -- Diarrhea has killed 25 people in Terceiro 
Congresso village, in Gaza Province's Massingir District, since 
the beginning of this year. Health authorities say the exact 
number of patients cannot be determined because many do not show 
up at health centers to report their ailments. (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Malaria -- Malaria cases have increased in large parts of 
Namibia, with the number of patients treated weekly in Owambo 
since last year nearly doubling. Over the past month between 
20-25 patients were treated weekly for malaria at Oshakati, 
compared to 10-15 patients the year before. In Kavango a 
spokesman for the hospital at Rundu described the increase as 
"massive," adding that there were deaths, but that figures would 
be released later. (Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in Afrikaans 16 Feb

<H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>
  AIDS -- "The reported cumulative total of full-blown AIDS 
cases in the country reached 27,905 by the end of last year but 
the National AIDS Coordination Programme [NACP] estimates that 
the actual total could be as high as 80,000 cases. Statistics 
compiled by NACP showed that Harare had the highest reported 
cumulative AIDS cases of 6,404, followed by Mashonaland East 
3,318, Masvingo 3,040, Midlands 2,869, Bulawayo 2,865, and 
Manicaland 2,599. Nearly 60 percent of the cases were aged 
between 20 and 40, while 15 percent were below the age of five."

  Malaria -- More than 2 million Africans die each year from 
malaria, half of them children under six, it was learned at a 
2-25 February seminar in Abidjan attended by about 50 experts 
representing 17 countries and the WHO. In economic terms, this 
represents an estimated $1.7 billion loss in 1995 for sub-Sahara 
African countries. 
  Prospects for marketing an anti-malaria vaccine were 
discussed at length by the participants but, as Dr. al-Hadi 
Benzerroug (Algeria WHO), the main moderator of the seminar, put 
it: "This is still in the realm of dreams." [Paris AFP in 
French 2010 GMT 25 Feb 94] 
<H5>  Ethiopia </H5>
  Cholera -- There has been a serious outbreak of cholera in 
eastern Ethiopia, and it seems to be centered in the town of 
Haraar. Princess Anne of Great Britain, who is in the area as 
part of a Save the Children tour, stumbled upon a large camp 
occupied by people suffering from cholera, something, it seems, 
the Ethiopian authorities are keen to cover up. Correspondent 
Lucy Hanan says that when the princess arrived there, the place 
was actually sealed off by guards and the local press was not 
allowed in. She says she saw four tents full of people who were 
affected by what she was told later was cholera. The affected 
people were in bad condition and the place did not look at all 
good. She says that according to reliable sources, there are 
now up to 130 cases a day, and about 3,000 people have already 
been affected by cholera. She says that the reason that 
governments are reluctant to acknowledge cholera is that the 
disease is associated with poverty and poor sanitation. 
Sometimes it affects exports, mainly coffee, which people fear 
may be contaminated. [London BBC World Service in English 1705 
GMT 27 Feb 94] 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  River blindness -- The Ministry of Health and 
nongovernmental 
organizations have been called upon to help put in place a 
sustained program to control the growing number of cases of 
river blindness in the Wassa Amenfi area. Dr. Kwaku Kakari, 
district medical officer in charge of the Wassa Akropong health 
center, told newsmen at Wassa Akropong that the disease appeared 
to be prevalent around Samreboi. He said last year alone, 696 
cases were reported at the Eti and Pii hospitals at Samreboi and 
41 cases at the Catholic hospital at Asankrangwa. Dr. Kakari 
said efforts have been made by the epidemiology division of the 
Ministry of Health to educate the public about the disease and 
drugs have been supplied for free distribution at the epidemic 
zones. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in English 0600

<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Guinea worm infestation -- A report from Oyo State says the 
incidence of guinea worm infestation is assuming disturbing 
proportion in Ibarapa local government area of the state. 
Reporter Femi Bobade says the state administrator, Navy Captain 
Adetoye Sode, visited the area yesterday to assess the 
situation. He said that mostly affected are the people of Iruwa 
and Lanlate, the two major towns in the local government. 
Already, a large number of the people are receiving treatment 
at various health centers in the local government area. On 
arrival at Iruwa, headquarters of the local government area, 
Administrator Sode expressed concern over the lack of potable 
water in the area despite the fact that there were two 
reservoirs in the area. He directed the director, personnel 
management, of the local government to liaise with the water 
corporation in investigating the matter and finding a lasting 
solution to it. At Lanlate, the administrator was shown about 
50 of the victims with the disease in various parts of their 
bodies. Addressing the people, the Oyo State commissioner for 
health, Mrs. Oluyoyede Fatunde, appealed to them to always boil 
or filter their water before drinking. [Lagos Radio Nigeria 
Network in English 0600 GMT 21 Feb 94] 
  Cerebro-spinal meningitis -- Reports say the death toll in 
the outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis in Lansa North local 
government area of Plateau State has risen to 28. The death 
toll was confirmed by the head of an investigation team 
dispatched to the area, Dr. Wandem. [Lagos Radio Nigeria Network 
in English 0600 GMT 28 Feb 94] 
<H5>  Somalia </H5>
  Cholera -- A statement issued by the office of the chairman 
of the High Council of the Internal Affairs Committee of the 
Somali National Alliance says a cholera outbreak has been 
officially confirmed in some districts of Somalia. Briefing 
reporters on the outbreak of the killer disease, the chairman of 
the High Council, Mr. Abdi Hasan Awale Qaydid, said, quoting the 
acting secretary general of the Somali Red Crescent, Dr. Ahmad 
Aptidon Kulmiye, that cholera was first diagnosed in Boosaaso 
and since has spread to the regional capital of the eastern 
region, Beledweyne. According to Dr. Ahmad Aptidon Kulmiye, the 
chairman said the outbreak was first detected on 5 February 
1994. The chairman added that the deaths started on 11 February 
1994, and since then 50 persons have died and 165 others have 
been diagnosed as cholera cases in hospitals. Many others may 
be suffering in their homes. [(Clandestine) Radio Mogadishu

  AIDS -- The British Medical Research Council and the Uganda 
Virus Research Institute, UVRI, have launched an intervention 
study in Masaka District to fight AIDS using a combination of 
information, education, communications, and sexually transmitted 
disease controls. The interventional project, which will cover 
18 parishes in Masaka District, was launched yesterday by the 
acting representative of the WHO in Uganda, Professor (Abiye Obo 
Koribo). He said the project epitomizes the aims of the WHO that 
the people of the world should receive adequate health care by 
the year 2000. Prof. (Obo Koribo) said this calls for the 
involvement of community participation and empowerment of the 
people with affordable and appropriate technology for their own 
health. He said research should not be sterile, but applied in 
the field. 
  The head of the program, Dr. (Dan Malda), said the project 
is 
expected to take five years and the actual intervention work 
would start in June or July this year. He said emphasisis would 
be put on community health based care in areas of control of 
sexually transmitted diseases and behavioral change in the 
control of HIV. [Kampala Radio Uganda Network in English 1700

<H5>  Zaire </H5>
  Bacillary dysentery -- An epidemic of bacillary dysentery is 
currently rampant in the Lomela area in Kasai Oriental, where it 
is said to have claimed 800 lives since 1993 from a population 
estimated at about 200,000. A local official, Honorable 
Ekumbaki Ombata Ilongo, who reported this epidemic to ZAIRIAN 
PRESS AGENCY, called on the country's authorities to take all 
necessary steps to deal with the disease. [Kinshasa Voix du

  Malaria/Diarrhea/Cholera -- "Over 220 people died of malaria 
in Inhambane Province out of the 3,200 cases reported in 1993. 
Our correspondent says 9,700 diarrhea cases were also reported 
in the same period, claiming the lives of nine people. One 
person died out of the 200 cholera cases reported in 1993." 
(Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 3 Feb 
94) 
  Sanguinary Diarrhea -- Cases of sanguinary diarrhea which 
emerged in Angoche District, Nampula Province, in 1993 are still 
raising drastically. In January 1994 three people died and 64 
cases were recorded in the rural hospital. (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique in Portuguese 1030 GMT 5 Feb)

  AIDS -- Health Minister Dr. Derek von Wissell says "seventy 
percent of the children in the country are sexually active by 
the time they are 16 years, and almost 100 percent by the time 
they are 19 years." He said 90 percent of the population know 
about AIDS, and how it is transmitted, but less then 20 percent 
take the necessary precautions. New AIDS cases "will increase 
from 9,590 in 1994 to 21,000 by the year 2000," he said.

  AIDS -- "Zimbabwe's National AIDS program says although more 
than 27,000 cases of the disease have been registered in 
Zimbabwe, the exact number of victims could be closer to 
80,000." Eight-hundred- thousand Zimbabweans, most of them in 
the 20 to 49-year-age group "are thought to be infected by the 
HIV virus." Officials say the disease could orphan about 
600,000 children by the turn of the century. An international 
AIDS conference held in Berlin last year "found that Zimbabwe 
had the third largest number of AIDS cases in southern Africa 
after Malawi and Tanzania." (Johannesburg Channel Africa Radio 
in English 1600 GMT 1 February 94)

concerning outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items 
are listed by country and disease. The source follows each item. 
<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Cholera -- Cholera is the disease which causes most victims 
in the Angolan capital, Luanda. Reliable sources say the 
situation has worsened due to poor living conditions and lack of 
vaccinations, which the government stopped supplying. The 
situation is dramatic in suburban areas. (Jamba Voz da

  [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- The number of reported cases 
of AIDS in South Africa increased 27 percent last year on the 
figure for 1992 and remains seriously under-reported, Minister 
of Health and Welfare Minister Rina Venter said in Durban on 
Monday. She said most unreported cases appeared to be 
mother-to-child infections. 
  She said that in the 1993/4 fiscal year, more than 
R[rand]21,056,000 had been allocated to AIDS support, research 
and information, marketing, training and health education and 
administration. Non-governmental organisations received 
R2,074,000. 
  Although this budget might be considered insufficient, it 
had 
to be remembered the government had a multi-faceted approach to 
the pandemic and was orientated towards a preventative approach 
rather than a curative one, said Dr. Venter. 
  She said a task force of the National AIDS Co-ordinating 
Committee of South Africa was developing a national plan, and 
the committee was being extended at regional level. "An AIDS 
health promotion programme should be an integral part of the 
local authority's existing health policy and control 
programmes," said Dr. Venter. Community participation plays an 
integral part of AIDS prevention activities. It means much more 
than merely complying with medical prescriptions or contributing 
labour and money to health plans that others have already judged 
appropriate for various communities. Participation simply means 
an alliance between communities, policy makers and health care 
workers for a common purpose." 
  She said when a community was involved in all aspects of 
AIDS 
prevention, new ideas and practices were widely and rapidly 
diffused. "Social networks are activated. People with similar 
values and experience trust and accept a [words indistinct] 
other than institutions reaching the `hard to reach' on their 
own terms may be the most valuable contribution of community 
participation." 
  Dr. Venter said the AIDS pandemic would have a wide-ranging 
socio-economic impact on many sectors of the southern African 
community, besides the health care system. "Sophisticated first 
world medical care could not only be unaffordable but it would 
also be inappropriate. The challenge is to ensure that AIDS 
prevention be made a high priority within the context of other 
health and social issues."

<F P=106> [Report by Vusi Sibisi] </F>
  [Text] The number of people with HIV has been projected at 
more than a quarter of a million by the year 2006 with annual 
AIDS-related deaths climbing to more than 27,000. 
  According to a draft report on the socio-economic impact of 
HIV/AIDS in Swaziland by Alan Whiteside and Greg Wood of 
Capricorn Africa Economic Associates released yesterday, HIV has 
probably spread more rapidly in the Kingdom than anywhere else 
in Africa -- where data is available -- with the possible 
exception of Botswana. 
  The study, commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Planning 
and Development, says the challenge facing the country is that 
of stopping the epidemic from spreading further, "and at least 
to reach the next generation as they grow to maturity and become 
sexually active". 
  According to the three-phased projections -- low, medium and 
high AIDS projections -- over a 12-year period to the year 2005, 
the total number of people with HIV is expected to number 
between 174,629 and 268,379 by the year 2006. And whereas the 
death rate over the projected period would be 10,417 in an 
AIDS-free environment, it has been projected that AIDS-related 
deaths would soar the death rate to 27,495 by the year 2005 with 
HIV population numbering 249,418, according to the draft 
report's high AIDS projection. 
  According to the draft report, more females, 138,235, than 
males, 121,017, would have HIV by the year 2005. This would 
result in new AIDS cases of 25,743 -- 15,890 females and 12,579 
males, during the projected period. 
  The projected total population by the year 2006 is expected 
to be 1,351,000 (658,000 males and 693,000 females) in an 
AIDS-free society. This declines to 1,086,605 (530,131 males 
and 556,474) for the low AIDS projection; 1,061,893 (518,154 
males and 543,739 females) for the medium AIDS projection; and 
1,034,080 (504,677 males and 529,404 females) for the high AIDS 
projection. 
  The draft report points out that the difference increases 
with time due to the expected growth rate in the "no-AIDS 
scenario, and a decline in this rate with AIDS.' "The life 
expectancy for both males and females also decreases with the 
advent of AIDS." 
  The draft report also warns that new AIDS cases, annual HIV 
births and annual AIDS deaths would continue to increase rapidly 
after 2006, noting that projections longer than approximately 12 
years are more difficult to accurately predict. The cummulative 
AIDS deaths would climb to 290,877 -- of which 141,069 would be 
males and 149,807 females -- by the year 2006 for the high AIDS 
projection, says the draft report. 
  The impact of AIDS deaths would slow down economic growth, 
strain the health services and social welfare, affect the 
education system and give rise to orphans. The majority of AIDS 
cases are and would continue to be prevalent in the sexually 
active population who are incidentally also the most 
economically active age group. 
  The study says factors which will probably contribute to the 
rapid spread of HIV-AIDS in Swaziland include migration (both 
internal and international), transport workers, rural/urban 
linkages, poverty, commercial sex workers, the role of women and 
high levels of STD's (sexually transmitted diseases). 
  The draft report notes: "AIDS is largely a sexually 
transmitted disease. People's vulnerability to the virus is 
closely linked to their sexual behaviour. This, in turn, is 
determined by their socio-economic circumstances and social 
behavioural norms. Certain factors may greatly increase 
vulnerability and, as such, increase the potential for disease 
transmission. It is axiomatic that successful intervention will 
not only seek behavioural change, but will also target 
socio-economic factors that are amenable to change. Indeed, this 
may be one of the key points for planners to examine."

  [Text] Taiyuan, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The rampant spread 
of endemic diseases in north China's Shanxi Province has now 
been brought under control thanks to the joint efforts of the 
local government and people. 
  The province is one of those blighted by a high incidence of 
endemic diseases such as Kaschin-Beck, Keshan, undulant fever, 
fluorine poisoning and iodine deficiency. 
  A recent survey conducted by the provincial endemic disease 
prevention and cure group shows that out of 118 cities and 
counties of the province, 107 suffer from such diseases and that 
in some counties the incidence of endemic disease has picked up 
sharply over the past few years. 
  It also shows that in Heshong and Qinyuan counties, the 
number of patients suffering from iodine deficiency, gas 
fluorine poisoning and Kaschin-Beck disease reached 120,000, 
accounting for 42 percent of the total population of these 
counties. 
  Analysts here attribute local poverty and economic 
underdevelopment partly to the spread of endemic diseases. Over 
30 percent of poor families had fallen on hard times due to 
chronic diseases, endemic diseases in particular. 
  Analysts say that endemic diseases here mainly attack the 
bones, joints and hearts of children and women of child-bearing 
age. 
  The survey indicates that among 2,853 primary and high 
school 
students in Heshong county who took physical examinations, the 
incidence of goiter was as high as 23.87 percent. 
  And in one village, some 8.8 percent of school-age children 
were deprived of going to school and 9.4 percent of primary 
school students were unable to graduate due to mental 
retardation caused by Keshan disease. 
  Figures show that of 7,172 children aged between seven and 
14 
in 24 counties heavily hit by undulant fever, the incidence rate 
of goiter due to iodine deficiency amounted to 32.94 percent. 
  Despite efforts to improve drinking water quality and 
heating 
facilities in the province, about two million people still live 
in high gas and fluorine poisoning areas. 
  The provincial government and party committee have paid ever 
closer attention to the prevention and control of endemic 
diseases and a range of forceful measures have been adopted 
since last year. 
  The move aims to curb the further spread of the diseases and 
bring the incidence rate under control at a level stipulated by 
the state. 
  Prevention and cure of endemic diseases has now been focused 
on strengthening the leadership and active participation of the 
whole society, according to local officials. 
  In May 1993, a provincial conference on controlling endemic 
diseases was called, and relevant rules and regulations were 
framed to reduce transmissions of the diseases among local 
people. 
  The leading bodies and offices in charge of prevention and 
cure of endemic diseases have now been reorganized in 11 
prefectures and cities, and a sound responsibility system has 
also been set up. 
  The local government at the same time has set aside hundreds 
of millions of yuan to boost the fight against endemic diseases 
from the beginning of 1994. 
  Starting from 1994, it will add one million yuan each year 
to 
the special 1.4 million yuan disease prevention fund. It will 
provide 100 million yuan in the coming three years to improve 
the drinking water in poverty-stricken areas. 
  Another six million yuan will be channeled toward updating 
the research equipment and facilities for preventing the 
diseases. A pharmaceuticals production center and a foundation 
are expected to be built and go into operation within the year. 
  An ample contingent of medical workers specially trained for 
prevention of endemic diseases is being built in the province 
and preferential policies have been formulated for promotion and 
pay for endemic disease specialists and medical workers. 
  Emphasis is being placed on spreading knowledge of endemic 
disease prevention and control and mobilizing the masses to 
fight against the diseases. 
  A book on prevention and cure of the endemic diseases was 
published by the provincial medical department and educational 
commission and will be used for teaching in primary and high 
schools throughout the province this year.

  [Text] Chengdu, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Sichuan Province in 
southwest China has made marked progress in preventing and 
curing endemic diseases, using foreign loans, local officials 
said. 
  According to officials at the provincial office for endemic 
disease prevention and cure, the local incidence rate of snail 
fever has dropped from 4.41 percent three years ago to the 
present 1.07 percent, and its incidence rate among cattle has 
plummeted from 10.6 percent to 3.5 percent. 
  The officials said the work was boosted with the aid of 
world 
bank loans, which the province began to use last year to bring 
snail fever under control. 
  During the past year, the province has been organizing 
specialists to spread knowledge in 41 counties on health care 
education, disease statistics, and supervision and treatment of 
endemic diseases. 
  The province is also promoting a comprehensive plan which 
involves boosting local economy and optimizing agricultural 
production. 
  On the other hand, scientific researchers have found more 
effective ways to check the spread of endemic diseases. 
  In addition, the officials revealed, people in 63 percent of 
the counties infested with endemic diseases are eating 
iodine-bearing salt. 
  The incidence rate of malaria has dropped by 54 percent 
compared with the previous year, and the spread of other 
diseases such as endemic fluorosis, keshan disease and 
osteoarthrosis deformans endemica has been checked, local 
officials said.

(0719 3185): "Pollution From Coal Burning Brings About Social 
Catastrophe; 30,000 People Live in Affected Areas"] 
  [Text] Qianxinan Autonomous Prefecture is an area that is 
rarely seen in the world in terms of frequent cases of arsenical 
poisoning caused by pollution from burning coal; the affected 
areas have a population of more than 30,000. In the areas 
affected by arsenical poisoning, the incidences of ascites due 
to cirrhosis, skin cancer, and lung cancer are very high. 
Patients suffering from chronic arsenical poisoning mainly live 
in Jiaole Village (formerly Jiaole Township), Yuzhang Town, 
Xingren County; and Dadi Village, Bayou Village, and Xiaogeduo 
Village under Xingyi City; as well as Anlong County's Haizi 
Township and Getang Town. The incidence of disease in Xingyi 
City and Xingren County has reached 17.28 percent, whereas in 
Anlong County a new affected area was discovered in the second 
half of 1993, and experts estimated that the incidence of 
disease there would surpass 17.28 percent. 
  Over the past few years, governments at various levels and 
the relevant departments have adopted measures time and again: 
Closing down some coal pits, banning coal mining in some 
districts, distributing medicine to people, and modifying their 
cooking stoves, thereby controlling arsenical poisoning to 
certain extent. However, the problem is still a very serious, 
as well as urgent one, which merits further attention from the 
authorities and various quarters of society.

  [Text] Kunming, March 7 (XINHUA) -- People in southwest 
China's Yunnan Province, a historically backward and 
disease-ridden area, have a life expectancy of 65.2 years, 25.2 
years longer than the average in the year of 1950. 
  According to officials from the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the province, home to 26 nationalities, has reached the 
level of moderately developed countries in the field. 
  Since Yunnan is located at an average sea-level of above 
2,000 meters, the diversity in climate and natural environment 
resulted in spread of many epidemic disease like snail fever, 
malaria, leprosy and goiter. 
  In 1930s, a plague hit Simao region, killing tens of 
thousands of people at this important material port in Southeast 
Asia. 
  Thanks to undertakings to improve medical and health 
conditions after New China was founded, epidemic diseases have 
been so far brought under strict control. 
  The Ministry of Public Health reported that infectious 
incidence rate has seen a dramatic drop in the past 12 years. 
Only four out of 10,000 catch such diseases as goiter, malaria 
and leprosy in some prefectures. 
  Among the country's border provinces, Yunnan has become the 
first with 85 percent of the population meeting vaccination 
requirements set by WHO. 
  More than half of its rural population of 32 million, 
including a large proportion who are ethnic people, now have 
access to clean water. 
  So far, the province has 6,500 hospitals, over 130,000 
medical professionals and practitioners and 82,000 hospital 
beds, respectively 67-fold, 135-fold and 134-fold more than in 
1950. 
  And a medical network throughout its 127 counties helps the 
province keep an eye on epidemic diseases. 
  Despite the great progress, it is not easy for the province 
to achieve the goal of every resident enjoying health care at 
the end of this century, as medical education is difficult to 
reach its mountainous areas because of poor transportation.

  [Text] At least two cases of the less common strain of HIV 
have been reported in Victoria. Janet Gribb reports that two 
men have been diagnosed positive for HIV-2, which is so far 
associated with people from West Africa and their sexual 
contacts: 
  [Begin Gribb recording] These two new cases bring to three 
the number of HIV-2 cases reported in Australia. This strain of 
the virus attacks the immune system in the same way, but appears 
to progress more slowly towards AIDS. The latest issue of the 
AUSTRALIAN HIV SURVEILLANCE REPORT said the two men diagnosed 
were in a relationship and the second man appeared to have 
contracted HIV-2 from his partner, who may have acquired the 
infection as long ago as mid-seventies. 
  Dr. Nick Crofts of the McFarlane Burnett Center for Medical 
Research says the two cases are interesting in that so far no 
links with West Africa have been established. He says the 
general public need not be concerned about the new cases, as all 
Australian blood products are tested for both strains of HIV.

  The Victorian AIDS Council says there is no need for any 
change in public health policy on AIDS and people should not be 
alarmed in the wake of the discovery. AIDS Council President 
Michael Bartoff said there are lots of similarities between the 
two AIDS strains: 
  [Begin Bartoff recording] In some ways there are not all 
that 
many implications. HIV-2 is pretty similar to HIV-1 -- it is 
transmitted in exactly the same way, its effects are pretty much 
exactly the same -- but in public health terms, in terms of the 
sort of prevention of transmission, it is really exactly the 
same as the HIV-1, and I think it is something that has also 
been well anticipated. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Thursday [3 February] agreed to provide a total of 12 billion 
dollars from now until the year 2000 for projects aimed at 
curbing the spread of AIDS and bringing the global population 
growth under control, Japanese officials said. 
  The agreement emerged from the bilateral "framework" trade 
negotiations under way in Tokyo, and will be officially 
announced after the meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton slated for February 11 
in Washington. 
  Under the scheme, Japan will give 3 billion dollars and the 
U.S. 9 billion dollars over the seven years. 
  The sums compare with 70 million dollars in annual financial 
aid extended by Japan for such purposes and 600 million dollars 
by the United States. 
  The sharply boosted aid will be used to try to find an AIDS 
cure, supply developing nations with condoms, and enlighten 
people there about the disease. 
  The money will also finance projects designed to spread 
knowledge of family planning and help poor countries compile 
more reliable population statistics. 
  According to data by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
the 
world's HIV carriers number 14 million at present and are 
projected to rise to 30-40 million by the year 2000.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Japan Energy Corp. said 
Thursday [10 March] that clinical tests on its newly developed 
second-generation AIDS medicine are set to get under way in the 
United States. 
  The tests, already approved by the U.S. Food And Drug 
Administration, will be conducted on a small number of patients 
at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, starting in mid-March. 
  Japan Energy is the first Japanese enterprise to begin 
clinical tests on a second-generation AIDS medicine. 
  Company officials said the firm hopes to file with the U.S. 
authorities in about three years for permission to produce the 
new medicine and market it as an oral drug. 
  The medicine will inhibit the working of a protease 
necessary 
for the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thereby 
arresting AIDS, the officials said.

Emergency Guard Against Rabies in Kyonggi and Kangwon Area"] 
  [Text] Residents and domestic animals infected with rabies 
have been discovered in Yonchon in Kangwon Province and Chorwon 
and Hwachon in Kangwon Province, as well as in the area near the 
Demilitarized zone where the entry of civilians is restricted, 
thus indicating an outbreak of rabies. Therefore, the Kyonggi 
Provincial government plans to inoculate 22,000 cows and dogs in 
northern Kyonggi Province. On 25 February, a neighborhood 
meeting was held in 553 places to discuss measures against 
rabies and a propaganda campaign on the prevention of rabies was 
conducted. 
  Meanwhile, the Domestic Animal Sanitation Research Institute 
in the Agricultural Promotion Agency recommended to the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Fisheries that the northern district in 
Kyonggi Province be designated as the first district for the 
prevention of rabies. 
  It was learned that rabies broke out in the Chorwon and 
Hwachon area last year, too, and that raccoons and wild cats 
that came to the villages to find food infected the dogs and 
cows by biting them in a fight. 
  The provincial government also requested the military units 
to shoot these animals to death as soon as they are found, and 
handed down a directive to each county and city to slaughter the 
infected cows and dogs.

  [Text] The Health Ministry has set up a special unit to 
control and prevent AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. 
Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai said the unit set up under 
the Disease Control Division of the Health Department last year 
is manned by seven senior medical officers headed by a director. 
The unit is responsible for the Malaysian program, strategy, 
and approach in tackling the AIDS problem. 
  He said this at a news conference after presenting a check 
for 100,000 ringgit [Malaysian currency] to the nongovernmental 
organization's council on AIDS at the ministry. The financial 
assistance is to help Malaysian AIDS Foundation to carry out its 
activities. Datuk Lee said the special unit, which has replaced 
the AIDS task force set up earlier, will monitor all AIDS cases 
and take appropriate steps to control the disease.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Sunday -- The number of dengue cases 
in Penang in the first two months of this year has exceeded that 
recorded in the whole of 1992, Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai 
said today. 
  He said records showed that there were 190 cases in January 
and February compared with 152 in 1992. Last year, there were 
601 cases with one death in the state. 
  The two-month figure also makes Penang the state with the 
highest number of cases for that period. 
  "We are making efforts to control the disease in the state," 
he said after launching a blood donation campaign organised by 
the Selangor and Federal Territory Hainan Association at Thean 
Hou Temple. 
  Lee said there were 5,598 dengue cases with 23 deaths in the 
country last year compared with 5,473 cases with 24 deaths in 
1992. 
  So far, the highest number or cases were recorded in 1991 -- 
6,628 with 39 deaths. 
  He attributed the large number of cases to the increase in 
the number of areas left as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and 
the ministry's ability to detect dengue cases better. 
  Lee said the ministry and local authorities had intensified 
efforts to check the disease. 
  He said 25,969 summonses were issued to those who had 
allowed 
Aedes mosqultoes to breed in their premises last year. 
  During the same period, 1.2 million ringgit in compound was 
collected while 102 people were charged in court for related 
offences. 
  Lee said the number of dengue cases were higher in urban 
areas. Last year there were 4,693 cases with 22 deaths in urban 
areas compared with 905 cases with one death in rural areas.

  [Text] Some foreign workers have been found to be carriers 
of malaria. Pahang state director of medical and health 
services, Dr. R. Mahadevan, however, said it is difficult to 
control them, as they seldom stayed in one place for long. 
  Dr. Mahadevan said another source of malaria was the Orang 
Asli [aborigines] in the interior areas. They, too, move from 
place to place. 
  Pahang has the second highest rate of malaria cases after 
Sabah.

  [Text] The deputy public health minister, Dr. Udomsin 
Sisaengnam, disclosed that the National AIDS Committee under the 
chairmanship of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai approved the test 
of a candidate vaccine [preceding two words in English] on 
ordinary people, who are listed as a low-risk group, to monitor 
any reaction and immunity change before the vaccine will be 
tested on HIV-infected patients. The approval was granted 
during a meeting on 14 February. 
  The deputy minister said that the vaccine test must be 
conducted in line with the rules and regulations set by the 
World Health Organization and will take time. 
  He denied the report on herbal medicine in Africa being used 
as an effective cure for AIDS, and said such rumors are harmful 
and will encourage promiscuity. 
  Officials in charge of the test project said that the Thai 
Red Cross Society will receive applications from volunteers who 
wish to join the project at the middle of this month. 
Volunteers must not be from a high-risk group or be 
HIV-infected. The vaccine test will not be conducted with 
pregnant women. 
  The U.S.-made vaccine is named (Cinvac). The test consists 
of three injections for a period of six months. The second 
injection is made one month after the first and the last at the 
end of the sixth month.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 26 -- A conference to evaluate last 
year's anti-malaria work in the northern provinces and work out 
a programme for 1994 was held in Bac Thai Province by the 
Ministry of Public Health. 
  Vice Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh attended the conference. 
  Last year, all the three targets of the anti-malaria 
programme were reached: the death rate from malaria dropped by 
30 percent, the number of malaria sufferers down by nearly 20 
percent and the number of malaria epidemics was 84 percent lower 
than in 1992. 
  In the central highlands, one of the worst affected areas, 
the death rate was down by 50 percent, while in the mountain 
provinces Tuyen Quang, Lang Son, Quang Ninh, Bac Thai and 15 
midland, northern and southwestern delta provinces, the number 
of malaria deaths was less than three each. 
  In 1993, the state provided 50 billion dong for the 
programme. Up to 3.67 million malaria patients were given 
treatment, and 458 mobile anti-malaria team worked at the 
village level. 
  The recorded death was little more than 1,000. Apart from 
the state budget, the localities also allotted 15 billion dong 
for the programme. 
  In 1994, the state decided to allocate 60 billion dong for 
the anti-malaria programme, which has a target reducing the 
mortality rate by 30 percent and the number of malaria outbreaks 
by 20 percent in comparison with 1993.

<F P=106> [Rodica Dirzu report: "Females Are More Affected by Cancer </F>
Than Males"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that, in our country, cancer does 
not belong among the first-ranking illnesses that cause death, 
it is still a great health problem owing especially to its 
social implications. The cancer death rate is higher in the 
urban areas than in rural areas. In the category of people aged 
33-60, the so-called category of active [working] persons, 29 
percent of the deaths among females are caused by cancer, 
whereas the same figure among men is merely 22 percent. Among 
females, the most frequent cases of cancer are breast cancer, 
followed by uterine and stomach cancer. Among males, the list 
is topped by lung and bronchial cancer, followed by stomach and 
prostate cancer. The category of active persons is most 
affected by cancer (50 percent of the cases belong to that 
category), followed by the group of persons aged 60- 65 (45 
percent), whereas the least affected is the group aged 0-33 (5 
percent.) The number of cancer cases among children has 
increased lately: In 1993, 1,071 such cases had to be treated, 
compared to 800 in 1992.

<F P=106> [V. Bunget-signed report: "The Number of Cancer Cases </F>
Explodes -- 500 New Cases Each Year"] 
  [Text] While until recently in Mehedinti County they 
registered a number of 400 new cancer cases each year, last year 
the number of those found to be suffering from that illness 
increased to 500. Among the most frequent forms of cancer are 
those of the thyroid gland, lungs, and leukemia. According to 
experts, such an alarming "explosion" of the number of new 
cancer cases is the consequence of radioactive emissions from 
Chernobyl. The peak is expected in 1996. 
  However, in the opinion of the experts, the large number of 
people in Mehedinti County condemned to death by this merciless 
illness may also be directly linked to the nuclear accident at 
Kozloduy (Bulgaria) [on the Danube, close to Mehedinti County] 
and with the risk factors currently existing in Mehedinti County 
itself, of which the principal ones are the rubber plant, the 
cellulose and paper mill, and, especially, the heavy water 
plant. To all this one can also add the typical illness of 
workers at the uranium extraction plant, endemic nephropathy or 
E-type uremia. On top of all this, owing to the disastrous 
financial policy of the current rulers, the number of hospital 
beds is insufficient and the necessary hospital equipment is 
also inadequate. Not to mention the current exorbitant cost of 
chemotherapy!

  [Text] The outline of a campaign to fight AIDS has been 
presented in the festive hall of the Belgrade Assembly building. 
Gordana Jevdjovic has the details: 
  [Begin Jevdjovic recording] What is involved is the first 
stage of the campaign, aimed at young people aged between 13 and 
17. The Yugoslav Association for Combating AIDS, the IDEA PLUS 
Agency, and the television's Third Channel have made a poster 
and a radio and television spot on the basis of a study. As it 
has been learned that young people have been informed about the 
ways AIDS spreads and the methods of protection, but that they 
do not apply that knowledge, the objective of this courageous 
campaign is to influence young people's way of life in a way 
most suitable for them. 
  It was said at the meeting that according to estimates, in 
the year 2000, 40 million people will be infected with AIDS. 
According to the latest data, there have been 322 AIDS cases in 
Yugoslavia and 251 in Belgrade alone. Therefore, one must not 
get discouraged about the struggle against AIDS. Campaigns 
aimed at adults and at people with atypical behavior are also 
planned. [end recording]

  [Text] Announcer: The Prishtina Medical 
Commission of Kosova League and the Red Cross are mobilized to 
avoid the epidemic of typhoid fever that, as you have been 
informed, has lately reached distressing proportions. Let us 
follow our reporter, Skender Durmishi: 
  Durmishi: Some 56 persons became sick during the 
epidemic of typhoid fever that broke out in Shtime over the last 
two months. Of these, 26 are handicapped persons, while the 
others are citizens of Shtime and near-by localities. So far, 
37 persons effected by typhoid fever have been hospitalized, 
while the others are under medical supervision, however, even 
those need hospital treatment due to the danger of the disease. 
  These associations [Medical Commission and Red Cross] 
ascertain that the main cause of the epidemic is the polluted 
water in the Shtime wells, which were locked in the two nearest 
quarters, as well as defects in the canalization network. At 
communal level, a disease-prevention staff has formed since the 
outbreak of the first signs of the epidemic. While, in some 
quarters, commissions have been formed so as to advise on the 
medical situation of the population, and particularly that of 
the families of the sick. The present competent institutions 
have warned the population to boil wellwater and to take 
drinking water only from safe sources. 
  In cooperation with the Mother Teresa Humanitarian 
Association, it became possible to ensure a considerable amount 
of soap, disinfection equipment, and necessary antibiotics and 
to inform the Federation of the International Red Cross and the 
World Health Organization. 
  A communique on the disease mainly ascertains the present 
situation, but at the end obliges the Medical Faculty 
epidemiologists to rapidly present concrete proposals on urgent 
measures to overcome the grave situation created by typhoid 
fever in Shtime.

  [Text] Kikinda -- After having diagnosed rabies in 
several wild and domestic animals, the Ministries for

intend to carry out the listing, vaccination, and marking of all 
unvaccinated dogs and cats older than four months. All citizens 
of Kikinda who are owners of unvaccinated animals, have to bring 
in their pets to the yard of the veterinary station next week

  The ministry has also issued a decree that, in order to 
successfully fight rabies, dogs and cats must be held locked in 
houses. In addition, trading in such animals, as well as 
exhibitions and fairs, is forbidden, which also applies to wild 
animals.
