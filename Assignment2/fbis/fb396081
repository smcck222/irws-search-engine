  [Text] The hostage drama at Truro House in Durban is over. 
Twelve people were arrested a short while ago after the hostages 
were released. The drama started early this afternoon when 
three House of Delegates employees were taken hostage by a group 
of seven (Bunela) residents at Truro House. They demanded that 
charges of trespassing against them be dropped. They had been 
charged with illegally occupying houses at Cato Manor near 
Durban. The suspects will appear in court tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By Guy Jepson] </F>
  [Text] Making cyanide-filled shells, waging an IRA-type 
terror campaign, planning to take over country towns, plotting a 
military coup ... the armies of the Right are being credited 
with a lot these days. The shouting down of General Constand 
Viljoen by his own followers, the spate of explosions in the 
Transvaal and [Orange] Free State, and threats of "total war" 
have all been offered as portents of large-scale resistance by 
the far Right. 
  While these developments undoubtedly reflect a hardening of 
attitudes among the conservative whites -- and the willingness 
of a minority to take up arms -- security analysts believe they 
do not signify the start of a major terror campaign. 
  Instead, the analysts argue, the major rightwing groups -- 
the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement], the Conservative Party and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] -- are likely to continue to 
negotiate and/or use disruptive strategies before resorting to 
open violence to achieve their aims. 
  Bill Sass of the Institute for Defence Policy says he doubts 
whether the current bomb blitz -- railway lines, pylons and ANC 
[African National Congress] property have been targeted in about 
30 attacks since November -- directly involves the major players 
"yet." 
  SAP [South African Police] public relations chief 
Major-General Leon Mellet agrees, saying the bombings are 
probably the work of small radical groupings or "cranks." 
  Political-risk consultant Dr. Wim Booyse argues that the 
bombings to a large extent reflect the revival of 
"fundamentalist" groups, of the small "brandy and Coke squads" 
which were active in 1990/1991. 
  "Some of the individuals may be linked to the formal 
right-wing but the deeds themselves are being carried out under 
the auspices of fundamentalist organisations. These, we found 
in the past, don't have any organisational structure. They are 
two and three-man bands." Referring to recent police 
breakthroughs in investigations into the attacks, Booyse adds 
that he would be "very surprised" if large numbers of people 
were arrested. 
  However, while the small groupings lack identifiable 
structures and are more security conscious after the police 
successes in 1990/1991, the groupings tend to be vulnerable to 
police penetration. Booyse says police solved 87 percent of the 
56 incidents in 1990. 
  When, then -- if ever -- is the formal right wing likely to 
enter the fray in earnest? 
  Mellet says that while many conservative whites who are 
disenchanted with the political process are preparing to defend 
themselves, "the actual number of people prepared to take up 
arms and start a war is few." He adds: "On the other hand, you 
take the IRA. They're only about 300-strong. You don't need an 
army to cause trouble. 
  "A lot of these people are also ex-military people and you 
can't ignore that fact. 
  "One can expect an increase in acts of sabotage and terror 
attacks ... I think they can cause enough trouble, but I don't 
think they have enough to ensure the election won't take place." 
  Despite the probability of a Freedom Alliance election 
boycott, Sass says the major right-wing groupings appear to have 
written off the election as "political action between the NP 
[National Party] and ANC to put themselves in a better 
position." He says: "The next step is to keep making their 
point, making their emphasis with the future government. I 
don't see a sudden escalation (in right-wing violence). What we 
are seeing now is not just because of the election -- it's going 
to continue past the election." 
  Booyse and Sass suggest that a real showdown could be 
delayed 
as long as five years after the election -- when the 
Constitution has to be implemented -- and then only if the 
formal right wing is not accommodated politically. 
  Sass says that even before resorting to bloodshed, the Right 
-- because many of its supporters are farmers, miners and 
electricity supply workers -- has the ability to severely 
disrupt the country. Although collective campaigns involving 
white labour unions and agricultural unions -- and possibly the 
Right's Freedom Alliance partners -- would be difficult to 
organise, they "could come later." 
  If the Right threw its full weight behind a concerted 
sabotage campaign, the results could be very costly for the new 
government. On the strength of the various right-wing 
para-military formations, Sass says, the AWB could have as many 
as "5,000 or 6,000 trained men," a relatively well-organised 
logistical line and, significantly, strong community support. 
  On the other hand, the more significant of the smaller 
paramilitary groupings would be able to deploy "tens or maybe 
hundreds" of combatants. 
  In terms of weapons, the organised right wing would have 9 
mm 
pistols and shotguns in abundance and "probably quite a few 
AK-47s, R-4s and R-5s," Sass says. Also, because of strong 
support from white miners, they would have access to "a fair 
amount of commercial explosives." 
  All told, they would have adequate quantities of weapons to 
wage a terror campaign, but not enough to take on the new 
government. 
  Booyse echoes this view, saying that although the Right 
would 
have the ability to carry out a sophisticated IRA-type terror 
campaign, it would lack the resources to wage low-intensity 
guerilla warfare. 
  Despite concerns about the extent of right-wing support in 
the SADF [South African Defense Force], Sass dismisses the 
prospect of a coup attempt -- in the short term -- by the 
generals who are currently negotiating the new National Defence 
Force with the ANC. However, he says sympathetic SADF members -- 
particularly in commandos in the rural areas where the right 
wing has strong support -- could break ranks if there was a 
major reaction on the part of the ANC against the Right "or if 
they perceived whites in general were under threat."

  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- A caller claiming to be 
Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] Commander Karl Zimbiri 
on Wednesday afternoon claimed repsonsibility for an attack in 
south-east Johannesburg that left two Alberton traffic officers 
critically wounded and a woman injured. Police said earlier the 
three were shot by the occupants of a bakkie [pick-up truck] the 
officers stopped near Alberton on Wednesday morning. 
  Police spokesman Lt Deon Peens said in a statement Mr H R J 
Killian, 35, was wounded and the main artery in one of his legs 
was severed, while Mr H van der Westhuizen, 44, was shot in the 
head. They were admitted to hospital. A woman, whose name has 
not been released, was wounded in the buttocks while she was 
sitting in a taxi near the scene of the shooting. 
  Commander "Zimbiri" used a pre-arranged code in his call but 
there was no other way SAPA could independently verify the 
authenticity of the call. 
  He said the Alberton attack killed three officers -- 
"whites, 
naturally." There was no immediate explanation for the 
discrepency between his account of the attack and the police 
version. 
  The caller added the attack formed part of a "farewell 
programme" for APLA Commander Sabelo Phama who died in a motor 
accident in Tanzania last week. 
  "Zimbiri" claimed the death had been no accident and that 
Phama had been assassinated in a plot jointly planned by South 
Africa's National Intelligence Services and the USA's CIA. 
  APLA is the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress of 
Azania.

  [Text] A top military official said yesterday he sees no 
direct links between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) 
and the Abu Sayaf, a breakaway group of the MNLF. 
  "There is no sufficient proof to show of a tie-up between 
the 
Abu Sayaf and the MNLF. On the contrary, the Abu Sayaf is bent 
on sabotaging the ongoing peace talks between the MNLF and the 
government," Brigadier General Rene S. Dado, AFP [Armed Forces 
of the Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) chief, said. 
  He urged the MNLF to stop giving refuge to Abu Sayaf members 
in their camps to express the MNLF disapproval of their acts of 
terrorism. 
  "By doing so, the Abu Sayaf will be completely isolated and 
this makes peace-loving and enlightened Muslims happier," Dado 
added. 
  The CRS chief traced the MNLF's generosity to Abu Sayaf 
members to old ties among leaders of the two groups. 
  Dado said the Abu Sayaf has only 120 full-time members, not 
1,000 as earlier reported. 
  He denied reports on the guns smuggled in by the Abu Sayaf 
"which could not be confirmed by military units in the area 
where the arms landing was supposed to have taken place." 
  He said the Abu Sayaf has adopted a guerrilla strategy.

  [Text] Cebu City -- The New People's Army (NPA) has 
threatened to bomb vital government and public utility 
installations in the Visayas if the government decides to 
reimpose the 28 January oil price increases it temporarily 
rolled back on 7 February. 
  A message from the PNP [Philippine National Police] 
headquarters in Camp Crame to the regional PNP command said the 
rebels plan to bomb the installations in Cebu, Bacolod, 
Dumaguete and lloilo. 
  The message said that among the installations targeted in 
Cebu are oil depots, power plants of the National Power Corp., 
the regional offices of the Central Bank, the Mactan Cebu 
International Airport and military facilities . 
  The message said the plan was hatched by Filemon Lagman, 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) secretary-general, at a 
conference of the CPP's Visayas Commission last 1 February. 
  It was not clear why the rebels aired the threat at a 
supposed meeting on 1 February when the roll-back came a week 
later. 
  Cebu Metrodiscom [metro district command] director Senior 
Superintendent Jose Ayap said he has already placed all police 
units under him under alert.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said in Geneva Saturday [12 February] that his 
government guaranteed foreigners' safety on its territory but 
could lose control of its own people if NATO carried out air 
strikes. 
  Karadzic told reporters: "If we are in full control of the 
situation we can fully guarantee the safety of aid workers in 
(the self-proclaimed) republic of Serbska." 
  He added: "But if there are going to be air strikes we may 
lose some control." 
  "We would never give such an order to harm foreigners in our 
country. But if they strike us then that's going to be chaos 
and this chaos may command many things we would never command," 
Karadzic said. 
  The foreign UN aid workers who were having trouble leaving 
Bosnia have reached Zagreb, a UN official said Saturday. 
  UN foreign workers in Banja Luka in northern Bosnia were 
denied permission to leave for Zagreb on Wednesday because they 
lacked a 48-hour pass required by authorities. The workers 
reached Zagreb Saturday, UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said in Geneva. 
  She described comments made by Bosnian Serb deputy military 
commander Milan Gvero on Wednesday to TANJUG news agency about 
stopping UN aid workers from leaving the country as a "rather 
frustrated" reaction to NATO threats of air strikes.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Sinisa Vucinic, 
chairman of the Serb Royalist Movement [Srpski Rojalisticki 
Pokret, SRP], said in Belgrade today that if NATO launches air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb positions on 20 February, "a special 
unit of the SRP would attack UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
members in Belgrade." 
  He said that "the West should take this threat seriously" 
and 
that the SRP would carry out its threats regardless of the 
Serbian Interior Ministry's reaction. 
  Vucinic stressed that SRP members in Frankfurt were ready to 
"launch terrorist attacks on the German people" if air strikes 
were launched against Bosnian Serb positions. [passage omitted

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb military 
leader Manojlo Milovanovic has vowed that in the event of NATO 
air strikes against his troops all foreigners in Serb-held 
territory would be taken hostage and possibly killed. 
  "In case of air strikes, all foreigners in the 
(self-proclaimed) Serb republic in Bosnia, including UN 
employees, Red Cross representatives and journalists, will 
become hostages," Milovanovic told the bi-monthly Serb newspaper 
INTERVJU in an article published Thursday. 
  He said his troops would retaliate against the air strikes 
and that "a massacre of international representatives could take 
place." 
  Milovanovic made the threat in an interview February 10, the 
newspaper said. 
  In Germany Thursday, the humanitarian aid organisation Cap 
Anamur said one of its representatives, Nedim Goletic, had been 
arrested by Bosnian Serb troops. 
  Rupert Neudeck, the head of Cap Anamur, which specializes in 
emergency medical aid, said Goletic was arrested Wednesday as he 
was travelling in a bus transporting Norwegian UN doctors 
between the towns of Zvornik and Kladanj. 
  He said Goletic, 32, is a native of Sarajevo but became a 
German citizen in 1988. 
  He worked for six months in the Moslem enclave of Tuzla, 
providing medical aid to injured women and children, and was 
unable to catch a UN flight to Split earlier this week. 
  The Norwegian doctors had then offered to give him a ride 
aboard their bus. 
  Serb authorities said they arrested him because he was not 
part of the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Interview with General-Major Manojlo Milovanovic, commander </F>
of the General Staff of the Army of the Serbian Republic, by 
Slavoljub Kacarevic; place and date not given: "NATO Will Not 
Strike"] 
  [Excerpts] It is said of General-Major Manojlo 
Milovanovic, commander of the General Staff of the Army of the 
Serbian Republic, that he is the mastermind of this army. This 
general, nicknamed "Mali [Little]" by his friends, caught our 
attention when (in the first half of February) he started 
negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the 
agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [Passage omitted] 
  [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air 
strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions 
set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize, 
what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army? 
  [Milovanovic] [passage omitted] We are making it plain to 
everybody that if air strikes do take place all foreigners on 
the territory of the Serbian Republic will become hostages. 
This also includes the representatives of the International Red 
Cross, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and, 
unfortunately, even journalists. Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead 
and attack! This is one of our defense mechanisms. 
Furthermore, as of 1 March, they have been flying in our sky 
and recorded everything. They have probably also placed 
numerous radio tracers [radio lokator] on the ground, along the 
separating lines. However, their problem is that they know all 
our capabilities [sentence as published]. Earlier they did not 
know, for example, that we can follow them all over Europe, and 
especially in Italy where they are concentrating. In one combat 
raid, as we soldiers call it, we can decimate their first shock 
group, which would consist of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a 
single chief of state whose air force is taking part in the 
attack would be able to justify this at home. 
  To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe, 
however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway, 
but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their 
technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates, 
destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This, 
however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware 
over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the 
territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the 
range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these 
enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of 
international representatives would take place. We have no other 
choice, we must defend ourselves. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The PP [Popular Party] federal deputy for Sao Paulo, 
Alberto Haddad, escaped a bomb attack in his political office in 
Pinheiros (western Sao Paulo). This information had been kept 
secret since 2 February, when the PM [Military Police] bomb 
squad was called. There are no clues on who planted the bomb. "I 
have suspicions about my enemies within the party," Haddad said.

  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo has reiterated that 
the Cali Cartel has promoted the campaign against the presence 
of U.S. troops on the Pacific coast to keep them out of the 
country. Miriam Ortiz has the report. 
  In his latest speeches, President Cesar Gaviria always 
linked 
the Cali Cartel to the controversy over the presence of U.S. 
military personnel in Juanchaco. 
  The defense minister today reiterated his position, which 
many people are now viewing as plausible. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] When the whole thing began, we 
noticed that drug traffickers were interested in some aspects of 
this scandal. I also think that the debate has had its own 
dynamics, and in many cases it is also a product of some 
people's deep-rooted ideas. We are not discarding the 
possibility that some sectors linked to drug trafficking are 
interested in this situation. [end recording] 
  Pardo also said that as long as applicable international 
agreements are in effect, U.S. troops will continue to come to 
Colombia.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 12 Feb (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported today, Saturday, that Alvaro Solano, a Colombian 
guerrilla leader also known as "El Guajiro," who is considered 
to be one of the chiefs of the Maoist dissidents from the 
Popular Liberation Army (EPL), was captured today in Neiva, 
capital of Huila Department (in the south). 
  The sources added that "thanks to some information," police 
arrested "El Guajiro" at Los Garzones airport in Neiva as he 
prepared to board a domestic flight. The EPL dissident rebel, 
who did not want to sign the peace agreement with the government 
in January 1991, is being interrogated today by authorities. 
  Solano or "El Guajiro" is accused of rebellion, association 
with criminal intent, and terrorism, among other charges. 
  Last 29 January, authorities captured another rebel from 
that 
group in Cartagena de Indias (in the north) called Guido Meneses 
Ruiz, the alleged author of the murder of 50 former members of 
his organization who rejoined civilian life through the EPL 
agreements in 1991.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified 
individuals blew up nine utility poles in the countryside, the 
police reported here today. 
  The police report published in the local media added that 
the 
departments (provinces) of Solola in the west and El Quiche in 
the north were left without electricity as a result of the 13 
February attack. 
  According to experts, the bombs were activated by remote 
control more than 100 meters from the site of the explosion. 
  There were approximately 20 bomb attacks against Congress, 
the electric power grid, television repeater stations, and 
several businesses in the latter part of January within the 
framework of the referendum on constitutional amendments.

  [Excerpt] Brigadier General Victor Augusto Vasquez 
Echeverria, commander of the military base in Quiche Department, 
said: "We will give Galil assault rifles to those who legally 
organize themselves to protect their properties." 
  Following the attack carried out by guerrillas on the 
morning 
of 13 February, the majority of the store owners are furious 
because the insurgents' actions have only caused them losses, he 
said. "They have stated they intend to join the Civilian 
Self-Defense Patrols to oppose the instability caused by the 
insurgents. The Constitution allows civilians to form groups to 
protect themselves from foreign forces," he pointed out. 
  On the morning of 13 February, members of the Poor People's 
Guerrilla Army (EGP) used explosive charges to topple nine 
electric posts in Chichicastenango and Solola. According to Gen. 
Vasquez, the operation was carried out simultaneously by groups 
of four rebels, and authorities found propaganda at the sites 
from the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the 
EGP alluding to the anniversaries of the two organizations. 
  He said: "We have sent more than 200 soldiers to patrol the 
area as the inhabitants of the three affected departments have 
requested." The URNG operation was executed at a strategic 
point, since the posts that were blown down interconnected the 
electricity network between Quiche Department, Chichicastenango 
Municipality, and Solola Department. 
  Up to yesterday, electrical power had not been restored in 
any of these places. Businesses opened as usual even though some 
products that required refrigeration were lost. Gasoline service 
stations used manual pumps, which caused a certain backlog of 
vehicles. Nothing like this has been experienced in this area 
since the beginning of the 1980's when guerrillas destroyed an 
electric power generator in the outskirts of Quiche. [passage

  Looking aged and with a humble voice softened by his days in

violence broke out in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Castellanos recording] I do agree that social 
injustice really exists. Obviously they are greatly removed 
from civilization and there was this outburst. The outburst 
could have taken another form since the government has been

resolved soon and that we think of ourselves as brothers,

situation. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, Feb 16 (AFP) -- General Absalon 
Castellanos, former governor of Chiapas was released today by 
guerrillas of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
according to images transmitted live on Mexican private 
television stations. 
  Castellanos, a division general who was held hostage by the 
guerrillas since 2 January, one day after the armed Indian 
revolt in the State of Chiapas was released in the town of 
Guadalupe Tepeyac of Chiapas at 1605 (2205 GMT). 
  The local Azteca television station transmitted this 
afternoon the arrival of Castellanos, 66, accompanied by armed 
guerrilla youths, at the site where he was awaited by Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho, the mediator, and Samuel Ruiz, 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, as well as hundreds of 
national and foreign journalists. 
  The town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, a zone where, according to 
the 
guerrillas, the Mexican Army was unable to enter during the 
armed conflict, is located in a vast mountain region 200 km from 
the city of San Cristobal from where a caravan of journalists 
left early Tuesday to cover the event. 
  The former Chiapas governor's release, announced on Monday 
by 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, is considered as the last 
step prior to the start of a peace dialogue between the EZLN and 
the government, the date and place of which might be announced 
in the coming hours. 
  The guerrillas announced Tuesday that as of Thursday they 
will stop collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has 
been implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional 
action to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue with 
the participation of EZLN leaders, Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho, and Monsignor Samuel Ruiz. 
  Gen. Castellanos, who governed Chiapas from 1982 to 1988, 
was 
kidnapped by the rebels at his Nuevo Momon Ranch in the 
municipality of Las Margaritas, one of the principal 
guerrilla-infested regions. Accused by the rebels of owning 
large land estates and of being responsible for "diverse crimes" 
against Indians, the 66-year-old former governor was tried by 
the ELN and sentenced to life and to carry out forced labor in 
an Indian community. Several days later, however, the 
guerrillas decided to acquit him "so that he could bear the 
shame of being pardoned" by those who were victims of the 
repression when he was governor. 
  In statements to Mexican newsmen who interviewed him in late 
January "somewhere" in the mountains of Chiapas, Castellanos 
said he had been treated well and asked the government to 
guarantee that after it engages in the dialogue with the rebels, 
"a witch hunt" will not be unleashed in that southern state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Enrique Obando, a military and subversion </F>
analyst, by Vidal Silva Navarrete -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Silva] Having read the Shining Path's [SL] "secret 
document" that was published by LA REPUBLICA this week, are 
there any changes in countersubversive strategy? 
  [Obando] A change was noted at the time [SL leader] Abimael 
Guzman's first letter was released; this document confirmed the 
change, clarified things, and ended speculation. Now we know 
what Abimael wants. 
  [Silva] What does he want? 
  [Obando] Two things. First, to save the leadership, and 
second, to save his entire party. The document says: "The 
people's war should not be developed, it must merely be 
maintained." As a precondition he establishes the need for a 
proletarian leadership, subordinated -- of course -- to him. 
The document adds: "The leadership problem will not be resolved 
for a long time." The document ends by quoting Mao: "All kind 
of miracles will be performed as long as there are masses and 
parties." 
  [Silva] Who is using whom? Is the government using Guzman or 
is Guzman using the government? 
  [Obando] Both are attempting to use the other. 
  [Silva] With what objectives and what are the risks? 
  [Obando] The SL seems to be trying to save its leadership on 
the understanding that members have a messianic view of their 
leaders. Guzman considers himself the greatest Marxist-Leninist 
alive and the only one who can give the right direction to the 
world revolution. That is why it is essential to save the 
leader. 
  [Silva] Save him from death? 
  [Obando] They know they cannot be sentenced to death but 
they 
are trying to maintain Guzman's contact with the party because 
it is useless to have a leader if there is no contact with the 
party. Guzman has managed to pull the strings of the party again 
and is trying to prevent the government from squashing the party 
completely because he knows this can happen. 
  [Silva] Is Guzman in complete control of the party? 
  [Obando] He controls the people in prison and is trying to 
control the people outside prison. 
  [Silva] Can that split the party? 
  [Obando] Yes. But he controls the party's internal struggle 
like in the old times. He talks about developing the struggle 
between two lines and "trying to keep the exodus to a minimum." 
  [Silva] So the government allowed Guzman to take back 
control 
over his party which he lost for a year by being kept 
incommunicado. 
  [Obando] That is right. Guzman is struggling, and apparently 
winning, the struggle against the group headed by Comrade 
Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, SL chief in central Peru]. I 
understand Feliciano's people are being reported to officials by 
the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] What does the government want? 
  [Obando] To discredit Guzman. The myth already ended, first, 
when he was captured and again when he wrote the letters asking 
for negotiations toward a peace agreement. After calling the 
president a murderer, who starved people, of being a servant of 
imperialism, he now treats him with respect, even with words of 
praise. 
  [Silva] With its references to 5 April [1992, the date on 
which President Fujimori dissolved Congress]? 
  [Obando] Exactly. But the government also wants the SL to 
lay down its arms. Guzman has the key to that because he says 
five or six years will pass before returning to the armed 
struggle. Meanwhile he says the talks must be in diplomatic 
language, no arms must be used, and a struggle must be made to 
allow a new revolutionary wave to emerge. Fujimori is thus 
assured that there will not be any attacks during those five or 
six years. 
  [Silva] Will he then be reelected? 
  [Obando] The big question is if, after that pause, we will 
see new and bigger attacks than those we have seen so far or if 
the government will use this truce to crush the Shining Path 
once and for all. 
  [Silva] Will this be only a truce? 
  [Obando] It could be but, there is also the possibility that 
the government will use Guzman to crush the Feliciano group, and 
once this is achieved then also crush the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] So both Guzman and the government get an advantage 
from the negotiations. The question is, who loses? 
  [Obando] It depends. It is possible that July 1995, which is 
the date given by Fujimori to crush the SL, will not be 
fulfilled but if someone sticks to that date Fujimori may agree 
to nonaggression for some time. Thus, everyone apparently will 
win but the country will lose in the long run. It would be the 
hibernation of the SL prior to a bloodier and more destructive 
return. This would be an act of treason. 
  [Silva] Do you believe this is happening? 
  [Obando] I don't think so, there is no reason for it and the 
Armed Forces would not allow it. The Armed Forces could crush 
the Shining Path. The proof of this is the fact that Guzman is 
negotiating. He would not negotiate if he knew his party's life 
was not at stake despite the blows. 
  [Silva] How can a man who was sentenced to life in prison 
and 
to be held incommunicado, exert pressure and negotiate? 
  [Obando] He cannot exert pressure. The SL received a harsh 
blow but, as the period of agony can last five years or more, 
the government wants a shortcut and are hurrying to fulfill a 
political promise in 1995 for electoral reasons. The SL could 
be crushed slowly but inexorably. There is no need to rush. 
The SL was hit hard because it was rushing, because it took a 
terrorist shortcut to take over the government in 10 or 15 years 
instead of its publicized prolonged people's war of 50 or 60 
years. For taking a shortcut in 1995, one could make the 
mistake of making a pact with the enemy and this is what should 
not be done. The war could last four or five years more and we 
will win it for sure, but because we want to win before the 1995 
elections we will make a pact and subsequently lose. 
  [Silva] You said the Armed Forces would not allow a pact 
with 
the SL, but why think of an institutionalized Armed Forces 
instead of thinking of an institution where personal 
calculations and the permanence in the commands are at play only 
because of the possibility of a presidential reelection? 
  [Obando] The Armed Forces and the police paid for their 
partial victory with their blood. There are lower rank officers 
who paid with sacrifice and with their lives for the struggle 
against the SL. These officers would not see the negotiations 
with good eyes if they know they can win. 
  [Silva] Under what conditions are negotiations held with the 
enemy? 
  [Obando] Negotiations are held when there is a military draw 
or when they are unable to obtain and achieve an easy victory 
and there is no desire to pay the price. 
  [Silva] But is there not a military draw now? 
  [Obando] Yes, but the cost that would be paid would be much 
less than what has been paid so far in almost 14 years of war. 
It would be like giving away something for no reason. 
  [Silva] The officers who were directly involved in the war 
would see the negotiations badly but would be unable to revert 
the situation because of the vertical command in the Armed 
Forces? 
  [Obando] Depending on the agreement reached and whether it 
would allow the SL to fulfill its objective, there may be some 
uneasiness in the Armed Forces, except among those who identify 
themselves with the government. 
  [Silva] Were some officers annoyed when Elena Iparraguirre 
received a cake on her birthday? 
  [Obando] Even some civilians were annoyed, but the fact that 
she received a cake does not seem to me as serious as reaching 
an agreement in the terms established in the document. 
  [Silva] Do you have doubts about the authenticity of the 
document? 
  [Obando] The way it is written seems to me identical to the 
terms the Shining Path leaders have always used, it seems an 
authentic document of the SL leadership in which they admit some 
things that are becoming very difficult to do. 
  [Silva] Considering the strict control on Guzman, the 
Intelligence Service must have known about this document before 
it reached SL militants. 
  [Obando] I have no doubt about that because as far as I know 
the document was sent by a SL woman leader from the Callao 
military base to another prison to convince other members to 
obey Guzman. 
  [Silva] The document describes facts or situations that 
occurred after Guzman was captured. For example it has released 
economic information this month such as the 1993 inflation rate 
or the growth of the gross domestic product. Does Guzman have 
full access to press information? 
  [Obando] Undoubtedly this could have been the first point of 
negotiation, the lifting of the incommunicado status allowing 
the visit of other SL leaders from other prisons, the 
possibility of writing, reading, watching television. Guzman 
knows what is happening outside. 
  [Silva] Is the court sentence to keep Guzman in complete 
incommunicado status being violated by the government and the 
Intelligence Service? 
  [Obando] In theory he is supposed to be incommunicado but I 
would not make a big issue out of this under the understanding 
that it is being done to defeat the Shining Path. 
  [Silva] Is there anything unclear in the negotiations? 
  [Obando] This is a game in which the one who hides his cards 
from the enemy wins. If the government announces its plan and 
everyone knows about it, then it gives victory to the enemy. We 
all know the SL plan and this is an advantage for the government. 
  [Silva] Why is it not possible to have a pact with the SL? 
  [Obando] Because in an agreement there are two parties that 
yield some. Guzman says he promises peace for a period. What 
can the government give in exchange? It cannot allow the SL to 
become a legal political party or surrender in stages by keeping 
armed cells. The only possibility is to discuss the penalties 
for the ones who surrendered or conditions for imprisonment. 
That would be like planting a bomb for the next government and 
that would be treason. 
  [Silva] What other characteristics do you see in the 
document? 
  [Obando] First, an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's 
leadership, a recognition that circumstances have changed, and 
that appropriate decisions must be made such as the peace 
agreement, and the second congress. The big question is: how 
can Guzman believe he will win with this strategy when all the 
things he writes and the talks he holds are known by the 
Intelligence Service? Guzman is no fool, he knows that, which 
makes me fear there is some agreement about which we do not know.

  [Text] An unofficial source has stated that the number of 
Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) police personnel might be 
reduced by 30 percent following a decision by high-ranking 
Interior Ministry officials. It is believed that PNP [Peruvian 
National Police] General Luis Dominguez Soliz, the DINCOTE 
Commander, has been notified. 
  The promoters of this decision believe a cut in personnel 
will enhance the efficiency of police action. This opinion, 
however, is not shared by most DINCOTE officers who say that 
many times DINCOTE personnel cannot cope with the volume of work 
in their fight against terrorism. 
  Reliable sources state that this decision reflects a 
government decision to cut the DINCOTE budget and eliminate the 
300-soles bonus given to its personnel. 
  It was leaked that the cut in DINCOTE's specialized 
personnel 
will be made in three stages. The first stage entails the 
dismissal of 200 chiefs, officers, and subalterns, in February. 
  The second and third stages foresee the lay-off of another 
100 detectives, thus concluding the personnel reduction. 
  It has not been disclosed what will become of those who will 
be laid off. 
  Asked to comment on this, some officers noted that the 
decision caused disappointment among DINCOTE personnel and a 
split into two groups -- those who favor and those who oppose 
the measure. 
  Officers pointed out that the latter group represent the 
majority who believe a reduction in personnel will virtually 
curtail the unit that has produced the most resounding successes 
of the PNP. 
  Our source stated that the current budget was drafted when 
PNP Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal Herrera was installed 
as the DINCOTE commander. 
  It was precisely at that time that DINCOTE personnel made 
the 
so-called "most spectacular capture of the century," when they 
arrested [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso without 
firing a single shot on 12 September 1992. 
  Unless the Interior Minister reverses its decision, morale 
will be further undermined -- especially that of subalterns 
whose wages are very low. 
  One DINCOTE officer remarked that last month Interior 
Ministry spokesmen announced a pay increase for subaltern 
personnel, but this has not yet happened.

<F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>
  [Text] With the recent dismantling of the first Shining 
Path cell in Tarapoto, the silent spread of the Shining Path 
[SL] in the Huallaga region was limited, but apparently not 
sufficiently. 
  After the arrest of a cell that planned to "unleash" a 
strong 
wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its 
attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the 
defeat inflicted by the Army. 
  During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to 
testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to 
extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their 
latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin, 
control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and, 
what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their 
old areas of influence in the region. 
  The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas 
abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper 
Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and 
injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack 
took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH 
officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley. 
Two weeks before the attack, the Shining Path had threatened the 
PEAH officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso 
Ugarte. 
  PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have 
received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui 
have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats. 
  A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo 
Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members 
gathered the population and appointed some delegates. "We did 
not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to 
defend ourselves," a peasant patrol member in the area told us. 
  In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto, 
located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people 
hailed the Shining Path on the evening of last 8 December. 
  In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of 
SL members attempted to gather the population and appoint 
delegates a few weeks ago. 
  A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the 
towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal 
files. 
  In Ponaza and Biavo, the Shining Path arrived to control 
some 
hamlets and strengthened their presence in the region's capital 
in the past few months. 
  The Shining Path apparently is concentrating on turning this 
strategic area of the Huallaga region into its most important 
bastion because it has not suffered many casualties there and 
has made much progress. 
  The fast spread of the Shining Path in the region represents 
serious danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had 
divided control over San Martin Department among themselves: 
The territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA 
and the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by 
the Shining Path. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have 
changed. 
  The Shining Path currently operates freely in the area 
previously controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are 
located in the extended territory between Tocache and the Lower 
Huallaga. The Shining Path still maintains strong influence in 
its old area of influence between Huicungo and southern San 
Martin Department. 
  In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of 
Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon. 
Military sources guarantee that in these areas several 
subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro 
Rojo, and T-4, which work with the "local force" of the Regional 
Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the 
region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those 
provinces to indoctrinate members. 
  The "main force" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the 
subversives have named "Conquistar," "Atreverse," "Tormenta," 
and "Mar Rojo," or "ZB," "JR," and "AQ." These groups control 
Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and 
San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are "mobile" and 
are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed. 
  According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa 
Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla, 
Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other 
hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new "red zones" while 
La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue 
being areas in which the Shining Path has its "basic force" 
dedicated to production and surveillance. 
  "Open people's committees" are thought to have been set up 
in 
several of the aforementioned places. 
  Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo 
Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter 
Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora -- 
have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin 
region. 
  During a ceremony at the "Leoncio Prado" military post at 
the 
end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the 
SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto. 
Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga 
has kept its structure nearly intact. 
  According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major 
attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The 
cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in 
Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been 
entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting 
new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and 
propagandizing SL ideology in the city. 
  The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the Shining 
Path, but there are no indications that it was a mortal one.

  [Text] Shining Path [SL] members who fled to Sweden have 
issued a lengthy and confusing leaflet, dated 3 December, under 
the letterhead Popular Movements Peru [Movimientos Populares 
Peru], which reveals their acceptance of a "peace agreement" 
proposed by SL leader Abimael Guzman to President Alberto 
Fujimori's government. The leaflet, entitled "New Great 
Decision: Strive for a Peace Agreement in Peru!" was sent to 
EXPRESO together with -- and this is what is amazing -- a 
"Directive" signed by Guzman. 
  The directive, text of which we published below, was drafted 
on 22 October 1993 and nobody knows how it got from Guzman's 
cell in the Callao Naval base to Stockholm. As can be seen in 
the "contents and grounds" of the "Directive," Guzman says that 
with him and the rest of the leadership in prison, the 
"revolution" is not possible and proposes to postpone it until 
the 21st Century. 
<H5>  Directive: Contents and Grounds </H5>
  By thoroughly assessing our situation and prospects, we have 
come to the conclusion that the PCP [Peruvian Communist Party] 
must assume and strive for a New Great Decision and Definition. 
The following are the main grounds for this: 
  1. One phase of the revolution has ended. Here's to the 
next phase of the World Revolution! Each party and organization 
must clearly and deeply determine how it serves and will serve 
the RPM [World Proletarian Revolution]... Our Decision and 
Definition adjusts to our situation. 
  2. The bureaucratic path is gaining shape and becoming 
feasible! 
  3. The GP [Popular War] can only remain as it is, rather 
than develop and pose growing threats. 
  Six indispensable conditions for victory are at stake: 
  1. Proletarian leadership; 
  2. Support of the masses; 
  3. Strategic centralization; 
  4. New type of army; 
  5. Extended war; and 
  6. Favorable international situation. 
  The first is the most important of the six conditions. 
  4. The Leadership problem cannot be solved on a timely 
basis. 
  5. New Great Decision: "Strive for a Peace Agreement!" and a 
Great Definition: Second Congress. The first represents the 
grounds, and the second the guidelines. Aim for the 21st 
century as a decade. 
  6. Miracles will be possible as long as the masses and Party 
exist. 
  This is the Directive. It should be firmly and resolutely 
implemented. 
  22 October 1993 
  Signed: President Gonzalo, leader of the PCP.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Some weeks ago SL slogans, 
quite different to the usual ones, appeared on walls and even on 
posters. They read: "Let us strive for a peace agreement"; "Let 
us stand and fight for a great decision and a great definition"; 
and, "Let us support President Gonzalo [SL leader Abimael 
Guzman] and the leadership." In addition to this, last 25 
January a local newspaper published a long SL document, which is 
"secret" according to the newspaper's editors, entitled: "The SL 
is using the `peace agreement' to gain time." 
  These facts inevitably awakened more than one specialist on 
Shining Path affairs, "experts" who study the violence 
phenomenon in Peru, with some exceptions obviously, whose 
apocalyptic predictions made before 12 September 1992 [when 
Guzman was arrested] we had forgotten. [passage omitted] 
  Santiago Pedraglio, another expert on the subject, believes 
it is a mistake to identify what is called a "peace agreement 
with the overall pacification of the country." 
  He said: It is fair to request the ideological defeat of the 
SL, but we should not "confuse apples and oranges." There is a 
time and way to defeat the SL ideologically, but this is not the 
same as a political, and especially a military, defeat. The 
ideological defeat does not fit in a negotiation, no matter how 
different it may be. The Shining Path's ideological defeat not 
only concerns the government and Fujimorism, but also and 
especially the opposition... It is surprising, therefore, that 
criticism of any negotiation with the SL is coming from some of 
those who for many years fervently upheld the need for a 
political outcome to the armed conflict. It seems that they are 
blinded by their anti-Fujimori feelings. This is extremely 
dangerous because it encourages a military outcome from the 
opposition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 11 Feb (EFE) -- A Shining Path dissident 
faction which rejects the peace agreement proposed by Shining 
Path leader Abimael Guzman has formed the "People's Liberation 
Army" (EPL) [Ejercito Popular de Liberacion], the Peruvian 
police reported today. A National Counterterrorism Directorate 
(DINCOTE) spokesman explained that the EPL has rejected Guzman's 
leadership and claims it is the authentic representative of 
Maoist communism in Peru. 
  Abimael Guzman, arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to 
life in prison, admitted the political and military defeat of 
his organization that took up in arms in 1980, and asked 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to negotiate a peace 
settlement. 
  According to the spokesman, the EPL leaders are: Alberto 
Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano"; Julio Cesar Mezzich; 
and a third chieftain whose identity is kept secret by 
government information services. 
  The schism in the Peruvian terrorist band was confirmed in 
documents found by police when they arrested a group of 10 EPL 
members in the San Juan de Lurigancho district in Lima recently. 
In the documents, the dissidents call Guzman and his followers, 
"the opportunist rightist line" of the Peruvian Communist Party, 
the official name of Shining Path. In other messages, previously 
confiscated in several Peruvian jails, it was also established 
that the Shining Path members who are loyal to their leader call 
the EPL "the leftist execution line," the police source added. 
  According to police, the arrest of the EPL terrorists has 
neutralized the terrorist offensive which was launched in Lima 
on 7 February, when a car bomb exploded next to the Air Force 
headquarters and a bomb was placed next to an Army garrison. 
  The terrorists were arrested in the Cerro "Casablanca" area, 
where they had established a training camp for handling weapons 
and explosives.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 12 Feb (EFE) -- The police reported today 
that a printing shop of the terrorist Shining Path [SL], where 
its clandestine newspaper EL DIARIO is printed, has been raided 
in Lima. 
  According to the source, National Counterterrorism 
Directorate (DINCOTE) agents carried out an operation on 6 
February and captured 20 SL activists. 
  The detainees were involved in publishing the clandestine 
newspaper and in the SL's political propaganda. The SL is still 
active in Peru. 
  The police did not report the printing shop's location in 
Lima. 
  The authorities believe its discovery and dismantling 
represents a harsh blow against the SL because the printing shop 
belongs to the SL group that has not obeyed the orders of 
Abimael Guzman, the terrorist organization's leader and founder, 
to reach a "peace accord" with the Peruvian Government.

  The raided printing shop was under the orders of the free SL 
Central Committee, which, according to the police, is headed by 
Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," the new leader of the 
terrorist gang. 
  The SL's hard-line faction seems to be headed by Catalina 
Adriansen, the wife of SL ideologist Antonio Diaz who was killed 
during the penitentiaries' massacre in 1986; "Feliciano," Margie 
Clavo Peralta, and Isabel Rengifo, among others. 
  Martha Huatay, Laura Zambrano, and Teresa Durand Araujo, the 
wife of Osman Morote, who was also detained and is another top 
Shining Path leader, are among the imprisoned SL leaders who 
support the "Feliciano" faction. 
  This faction, which pursues the violent actions of the SL, 
is 
responsible for the latest attacks in Lima against the Air Force 
headquarters and the "Barbones" barracks during which two people 
were killed, many were injured, and there was extensive property 
damage. 
  SL experts believe there is an irrevocable division within 
the SL between those who approve and those who reject Guzman's 
position. 
  The newspaper, EL COMERCIO, today says that SL leader Martha 
Huatay managed to take from the prison a message by Guzman when 
she visited the Navy prison where the Shining Path leader is 
being held. 
  The message reportedly said: "My detention represents a turn 
along the way, join the masses, the people shall win." 
  In 1992, DINCOTE agents raided another Shining Path printing 
shop in Lima that was managed by Jorge Durand Araujo, who is in 
prison. 
  Durand Araujo is the brother of Maximiliano and Teresa, who 
are being described as founder members of the SL.

<F P=106> [By Fernando Barrantes] </F>
  [Text] Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- Analysts said on Sunday that 
peace negotiations between government envoys and imprisoned 
Shining Path leaders are classified as top secret and only the 
National Intelligence Service has access to the meetings. The 
police, therefore, can only offer contradictory reports that 
confuse public opinion." [quotation marks as received] 
  The government disclosed the "secret nature" of the talks in 
a written response to a request for information by conservative 
Congressman Antero Flores Araoz. 
  Antiterrorist police believe that Shining Path Leader 
Abimael 
Guzman's calls for peace from jail have gained "the support of a 
significant portion of the organization. The rebel group is 
about to present the call at a clandestine congress to take 
place somewhere in Lima in April." The same source indicates, 
however, that Guzman managed to bypass the strict controls at El 
Callao Naval Base, where he is serving a life sentence, and 
delivered a document to rebel leader Martha Huatay ordering 
Shining Path to continue the 13-year-old war. 
  The official government reports state that the terrorist 
leader met with other imprisoned leaders of the organization, 
including Huatay, "to get them to submit to his command and join 
the plea for peace." Huatay, according to the police, hid the 
message in her underclothing. She managed to pass the message 
on after she and Osman Morote, Shining Path's second in command, 
were returned to the Puno Penitentiary in the Andean mountain 
plains. Police found the message when one of Huatay's relatives 
was trying to smuggle it out of the facility, probably using the 
same way of concealing it. 
  Press reports say that for weeks the government has been 
moving those rebel leaders who support the peace process from 
one detention facility to another so they can freely promote the 
idea. 
  According to documents circulating within Shining Path, the 
movement is divided into two factions: the "pacifists," who 
swear loyalty to Guzman, and "the hard-liners." The latter 
formed the "new reconstituted direction" that replaced the 
leader following his arrest in September 1992. 
  The "hard-liners" deny that Guzman wants peace. Police 
sources reported that their rivals are Oscar Ramirez and Teresa 
Durand -- nicknamed the "porfidios or perfidos" which was 
derived from the aliases of Feliciano and Doris. They were tried 
for rebellion and sentenced to life in prison by a military 
court in 1993. 
  According to the "hard-liners," Elena Iparraguirre (Guzman's 
companion), Edmundo Cox, and Maria Pantoja, who are also serving 
life sentences, are the current leaders of the "pacifists." 
During a recent visit to one of the jails in Lima, President 
Alberto Fujimori and Edmundo Cox shook hands before reporters. 
  The Peruvian opposition has repeatedly demanded that the 
government inform the people about the negotiation process in 
order for public opinion to stay abridge of the developments and 
thus clear all doubts surrounding the talks and deny the growing 
rumors that state "Guzman is trying to secure a pardon and his 
release into exile."

  [Text] Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The "Sunday Review" television 
program said that according to a "very reliable source," the end 
of the "popular war," the surrender of weapons, and a general 
amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement "without 
victors or vanquished," between the Shining Path and the 
Peruvian Government. 
  The administration of President Alberto Fujimori has 
admitted 
that talks, led by Abimael Guzman who has been serving a life 
sentence since October 1992, are being held between government 
representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison. No details, 
however, have been issued on discussions or possible agreements. 
  According to the "Sunday Review" program, directed by 
journalist Nicolas Lucar on the Lima America Channel 4 
Television Network, the 10-point agreement says its main aspect 
is to "stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: 
terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and 
propaganda." 
  Another point refers to "dismantling the People's Guerrilla 
Army with their surrender and the destruction of their weapons." 
It also includes the self-dismantling of the people's committees 
and the Shining Path's support base throughout the country. 
  A general amnesty has been mentioned and a process whereby, 
"little by little and in accordance with the circumstances, 
prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released and 
their sentences reduced." 
  Together with the "improvement of relations between both 
parties," it is also stressed that the agreement would be 
without "conquerors or vanquished," and would ease the way for 
the return of those Shining Path members living abroad "in order 
to recover the country's social and normal life." 
  The agreement would entail a "cessation of hostilities 
toward 
relatives of Shining Path members" and "the movement's archives, 
library, museum, and other symbols would also be returned." 
  One of the points in the agreement mentions the need for 
"economic support and investments in the areas devastated by the 
war." So far, government authorities have not denied or rejected 
the accuracy of this agreement between the government and 
Shining Path.

  [Excerpts] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori, who arrived in Colombia today, 
denied having conducted any negotiations whatsoever with the 
Shining Path, and he reiterated he will continue to implement 
harsh measures against that organization. 
  "We have made no contact with the terrorist leaders who are 
free," Fujimori said, denying Lima newspaper reports stating the 
government and Shining Path are holding meetings aimed at 
initiating a dialogue. 
  During a news conference, the Peruvian president added: "We 
have established contact via our intelligence services to 
capture their leaders but not to establish communication, let 
alone establish talks." 
  "The policy of my government is to capture the terrorists or 
confront and annihilate them," said the Peruvian head of state. 
  Fujimori warned: "I will not allow terrorists to continue 
perpetrating so many murders, and that is why we have adopted 
adequate measures, some of them harsh but effective." 
  According to official figures, the Maoist organization has 
caused the death of 25,000 Peruvians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Syed Zubair Ahmed: "Kathmandu, New Base for N-E </F>
Militants"] 
  [Text] Guwahati, Jan 4 -- After Bangladesh, where the 
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan is reportedly 
training and arming the underground outfits of the north-east 
Kathmandu is fast becoming another centre for such activities 
for the groups of this region, claim Army sources. 
  The latest rebel group to establish contact with the ISI in 
the Nepalese capital is the United Liberation Front of Asom 
(ULFA), according to the sources. This was corroborated by some 
ULFA activists who were arrested by the state police for 
allegedly taking part in the attack on a police station in 
Nagaon district recently. An arrested militant, Gowswami, 
revealed his outfit had a base in Kathmandu which was used for 
regrouping after the surrender of more than half of its cadres 
in March 1992. 
  According to the Army officials posted in Nagaland and 
Manipur, the other outfits which already have bases in Kathmandu 
are the Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), the Boro Security 
Force (BSF) of Assam and their umbrella organisation, the United 
Liberation Front of Seven Sisters, floated recently, allegedly 
with the help of the ISI. 
  The secessionist groups of the Kashmir Valley have been 
using 
the Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu as their base since the 
beginning of 1992. In fact, the ISI managed to push many top 
Kashmiri insurgents into India via Nepal. The sources say this 
is routinely done to prevent these "important" militants from 
being captured or killed by them while crossing over to the 
Valley from Pakistan. The modus operandi is simple. The rebels 
are trained in Pakistan and brought to Nepal on Pakistani 
passports. From Kathmandu they can enter India as Indians 
without arousing suspicion. 
  The Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu is being used as a base. 
This is, perhaps, not in the knowledge of the Nepalese 
government, unlike the Bangladesh government, sources claim. The 
Kathmandu base is a centre of indoctrination, where the ISI's 
job is to motivate the rebels of the north-east and provide 
logistical support. 
  The state police officials suspect that the recent spurt in 
violence by the ULFA was the result of its senior cadres 
regrouping in Kathmandu. They, however, rule out direct 
involvement of the ISI in the killing of four policemen in the 
attack on the Nagaon police station by the ULFA. 
  The defence sources also revealed the presence of an LTTE 
base in Moreh, a town located on the Indo-Myanmar border, where 
over 4,000 Tamilians from Myanmar settled several decades ago. 
But the threat from the Sri Lankan outfit is not great as its 
strength is negligible, say the sources. What they fear is a 
permanent liaison between the LTTE and the NSCN (I-M faction). 
"So far, we have no evidence to that effect," said a senior Army 
officer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander </F>
of the Northern Command, by Arye Kiesel; date and place not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mordekhay] Hizballah is 
not an invincible enemy. It must be understood that the terrain 
is hilly. Hizballah men come out of the villages on roads we 
are not watching. They cross mountains, river beds, rocks, and 
come within dozens of meters of our troops. They make use of 
the poor visibility and rough terrain, and the result on our end 
is painful. We have a problem with pinpointing intelligence on 
them, and we do not always have answers or information when they 
go on an operation, from where, and their goals. 
  [Kiesel] Does that mean that we will have to live with the 
harsh reality of having victims? 
  [Mordekhay] No. Their method of operation presents a 
difficulty. This is a type of guerrilla that comes out of areas 
that are not under our control, from civilian terrain of which 
they make full use. We will find ways and methods to hurt them. 
Last year, we carried out thousands of operations that proved 
themselves. 
  We are dealing with 130 km of a very hilly border. It is not 
all that simple. Hizballah does not have any bases or training 
sites. They work out of mosques and from inside a civilian 
population that is often held hostage. We cannot harm the 
population, but we will find ways to hurt Hizballah. 
  Compared with events in the security zone, one must remember 
that the northern settlements live in full security. Not a 
single Katyusha has been fired at the north since July. 
Furthermore, all attempts by terror squads to reach the border 
fence or get near it have been thwarted. 
  Last year was very painful for Hizballah. They suffered 126 
fatalities from our activity -- the highest figure ever -- and 
there are certainly more fatalities and casualties we do not 
know of. 
  [Kiesel] Is a war being waged in south Lebanon? 
  [Mordekhay] I never said that. There is a confrontation, 
there are battles, clashes, and exchanges of fire. I do not 
call this war. Anyone who wants to extend the definition of war 
or call it that is welcome to do so. War has certain 
characteristics which are not present here. In the security 
zone, we are constantly dealing with the situation. 
  [Kiesel] The deputy chief of staff called it war. 
  [Mordekhay] I know what the chief of staff and his deputy 
mean. They do not mean war in the broad sense of the word, 
where both parties employ their full forces; we certainly do 
not. There are exchanges of fire, clashes, and casualties. 
There are daily incidents. In a war you use all the means 
available to win. 
  [Kiesel] Does last week's incident in which four soldiers 
were killed and five injured in a Hizballah ambush indicate an 
escalation? 
  [Mordekhay] There has been a significant escalation in 
Hizballah activity over the past two weeks. They have been 
planting bombs and shooting antitank and Sagger missiles. The 
political process has an impact on Hizballah. It fears that the 
process with Syria is making progress, and that this would 
reduce their freedom of operation in the future, hence they are 
trying to demonstrate their force. When their activity dropped, 
they encountered pressure to resume activity. Also, without 
doubt, they are seriously influenced by the unprecedented scope 
of their recent arms and equipment procurements. 
  [Kiesel] Does the equipment come from Iran? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely. Iran sent dozens of Sagger missiles 
and hundreds of mortar bombs, as well as many other means, 
backing, money, guidance, and training, which led to a 
significant escalation. 
  [Kiesel] Does this mean that they have surprisingly 
recovered from Operation Accountability? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely. They suffered more than 100 
fatalities last year, but they filled out the ranks with new 
recruits. A vacuum was created after Operation Accountability. 
Lebanese residents called on the government to send in the army 
to help. The Lebanese Government tried to send in a battalion, 
but the Syrians prevented it from taking steps against 
Hizballah. As a result, Hizballah gained strength, started 
rebuilding itself, and -- enjoying an incredible cash flow from 
Iran -- in fact, strengthened its hold in the villages. Until 
Syria allows the Lebanese Government to deploy its Army freely 
in south Lebanon, Hizballah will have a good time. 
  [Kiesel] How deep is Hizballah-Iran cooperation? 
  [Mordekhay] Very deep and very tight. We know they are 
exchanging information, training, and advice. The Hizballah 
leadership travels to Iran for guidance, explanations, and 
ideas. They do not go there for vacation or to visit massage 
parlors, but to be trained. 
  [Kiesel] Your description indicates that the terror attacks 
cannot be prevented. 
  [Mordekhay] They can be reduced, but not totally eliminated. 
Our activity, in most cases, aims to reduce their freedom of 
operation and make them pay a price before they reach their 
goal, before leaving a base, or during contact with them. In 
the vast majority of the incidents we do manage to hit them from 
a distance. 
  [Kiesel] Why is the Air Force not employed to prevent 
ambushes such as happened last week? 
  [Mordekhay] The Air Force has its limitations, it cannot 
discover such ambushes. We use Air Force assault helicopters 
against specific targets. I do not believe, however, that the 
Air Force can significantly change the state of affairs here. 
  [Kiesel] Do you not feel that in fighting Hizballah the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] has its hands tied for fear a 
retaliation of katyushas could be fired at the northern 
settlements? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely not. No one has tied our hands. The 
political guidance we receive is very clear to us. We are 
serious people. We do consider the implications of our activity 
on the settlements of the north. We saw what happened when the 
situation deteriorated and they were hurt. [passage omitted] 
  [Kiesel] Do you believe that, once we reach agreement with 
them, the Syrians will curb Hizballah and discipline them? 
  [Mordekhay] I have no doubt about this. If Syria used its 
influence, it could significantly reduce the Hizballah military 
operability. It could stop the transfer of means to them. It 
could allow the Lebanese Army to deploy there. The Lebanese 
Army has done that throughout Lebanon, but has not lifted a 
finger in the areas adjacent to the security zone. 
  Syria is a key player. Syria acting the innocent last week 
and saying that it does not take part in Hizballah activity is 
not acceptable to us. Acting naive like this is unbecoming of a 
rattlesnake, not even one that breeds in Damascus. Had it 
wanted to, Syria could curb and significantly stop Hizballah. 
It is a question of a Syrian decision. If they wanted, the 
Lebanese Army could be stationed there, and it could cooperate 
with the IDF in dealing with Hizballah, removing them from the 
villages, and closing down the military supply routes from Iran. 
  [Kiesel] Do you know for certain of a terror act that the 
Syrians knew of in advance? 
  [Mordekhay] We cannot establish a direct link between a 
Syrian order or instruction and a terror act; the connection is 
merely circumstantial. Yet, Hizballah would like to fire 
katyushas at Israel, but it does not dare because it understands 
there are agreements which should not be deviated from. What 
reason did they have to abstain from activity for 10 days during 
the Clinton-al-Asad summit? These were the quietest days I can 
recall. There is a hand that guides Hizballah, and it comes 
from Syria. 
  [Kiesel] Do you believe al-Asad aims for peace? 
  [Mordekhay] Al-Asad understands the international and Middle 
Eastern strategic situation. At the same time, al-Asad has in 
no way dropped the military option. Along with conducting the 
political process, the Syrian military buildup continues. I 
believe al-Asad wants to attain Syrian interests and national 
goals in peaceful ways. If he fails, all options are open. 
  [Kiesel] The Intelligence Branch appreciates that he wants 
peace. Major General 'Uzi Dayan, however, said that if the 
political process gets stuck, a limited military operation is to 
be expected in 1994. What do you think? 
  [Mordekhay] I would not put a time frame on this, not even 
in terms of years. A process starts and no one knows when it 
will end or where it will lead. It must be understood that the 
other option -- the military option -- exists on the level of 
the ability in the field and on the conceptual level. When will 
it be used? When someone feels there is no other way. 
  [Kiesel] Do you mean that you do not rule out a Syrian 
military move, should all other options fail? 
  [Mordekhay] Our working assumption should be very clear: 
Syria is able to do it. The question is when. Knowing the IDF 
and Northern Command's power, I would urge him to think twice 
before making a move of a military nature. I believe he is 
aware of this. We have the power, and we have proved we will use 
it against anyone who tries to put our existence at risk. 
  [Kiesel] Has the Northern Command been asked to prepare 
withdrawal or redeployment plans for the Golan Heights? 
  [Mordekhay] No. No one in the command, including myself, is 
engaged in any plans that have political bearings. All of the 
plans I deal with, all the preparations, are within the scope of 
providing an answer in case someone does something, God forbid. 
Nothing else is happening in the Northern Command. 
  [Kiesel] If Syria means peace, would you recommend getting 
off the Golan Heights? 
  [Mordekhay] This is a political issue. I believe a military 
man should not, and must not, comment on such issues. When the 
Israeli Government has thoughts and potential scenarios, it will 
apparently present them to the people in charge of the Army and 
the territory in the command. We will present our assessments 
then. The problem is that the Golan Heights is too small for 
waging a modern war and reducing damage. If the threat is 
eliminated, or if there is another threat, we will have to 
examine the meaning and make political decisions. [passage

  [Text] Yusuf Mahmud Sha'ban, who was said yesterday to be 
the assassin of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, belongs 
to the Abu-Nidal organization [Fatah--the Revolutionary 
Council]. This report was confirmed today by a high-ranking 
security source, who said the murderer and three other 
Palestinians, suspected of being his accomplices in the 
assassination, are members of Fatah-the Revolutionary Council 
led by Sabri al-Banna, alias Abu-Nidal. The source said that 
the four individuals admitted that they are members of 
Fatah--the Revolutionary Council. 
  REUTER cited Brigadier General Staff Salim Salim, commander 
of the judicial police, as saying that the latest investigation 
into the case revealed that one of the three suspects is a 
woman, who is more of a witness than an accomplice to the crime. 
He noted that at first she declined to give particular 
information but did so later. The judiciary will determine the 
fate of each suspect. Security sources said the Palestinian 
detainees have been placed under strict security guard for fear 
that they might be attacked in jail. 
  President Ilyas al-Hirawi informed King Husayn of Jordan 
last 
night that the Lebanese authorities have apprehended the 
Jordanian diplomat's killer. He said the law will take its 
course.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tension in Libyan-Jordanian </F>
Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Amman, Beirut, Tripoli, Political 
Studies Center, news agencies -- [passage omitted] Reports in 
Amman linked Libya's support of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council 
to the extent of its involvement in al-Ma'ayitah's 
assassination, especially as the Jordanian monarch, King Husayn, 
pointed to the role of an Arab capital in the incident. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to 
resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe 
that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would 
weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis. 
At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the 
clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the 
information available has not indicated that Jordanian security 
services have taken any actions against members of the 
Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this 
connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all 
clues in light of the investigations with those suspected of 
carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon, 
and to determine whether they have any link with members of this 
organization in Jordan.

  [Text] Amman, AKHIR KHABAR -- The Libyan ambassador in 
Amman has denied Libya had any connection with the killing of 
the diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah. 
  The ambassador told AKHIR KHABAR that Libyan-Jordanian 
relations are extremely good. He said there is a plot that is 
intended to harm Libyan-Jordanian ties, saying that the plot 
that is being hatched is bigger than the Arab people. He said 
colonialist nations seek to create problems and sow discord in 
order to preoccupy the Arab people with bilateral and trilateral 
problems, in order to peddle their solutions and policies in the 
region. 
  Answering a question about any official contacts between the 
Libyans and the Jordanian Government, the ambassador said: The 
Jordanian Government knows the truth. There is no need for any 
contacts. It is difficult to discuss denial and confirmation 
between brothers. 
  Regarding the party that leaked the information to AFP, the 
ambassador said: We do not know who is behind this. But 
imagine that the United States has recently said that Libya is 
conspiring against its security. Who would believe that? 
Imagine a Third World nation conspiring against the security of 
a superpower? 
  The ambassador concluded: Reason must prevail in this 
region. The United States and the colonialist countries should 
know that we are not little children anymore. We should analyze 
things. Dialogue is not a bad approach.

<F P=106> [Bu Muhammad Dalbah] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Suspicion about a Libyan connection in 
the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in 
Beirut last month has been reinforced by reports that the 
Jordanian Government rejected a Libyan request to hand over two 
Libyan officers who had reportedly fled to Jordan in the wake of 
a failed coup attempt against Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi last 
October. 
  These reports state that two Libyan officers and a third 
person left for Jordan following the failure of this attempt and 
contacted the U.S. Embassy in Amman. 
  The two officers escaped across Libya's borders with a 
neighboring country on their way to Amman where they were joined 
by a civilian who was outside Libya when the detentions that 
followed the failed attempt were carried out. Two of the 
escapees belong to the al-Wa'ir clan, one of the most 
influential clans in the Libyan Warfalah tribe. 
  Libya demanded that the two officers be handed over, but the 
Jordanian authorities informed it that they were not in Amman. 
Actually, they had been transferred to a U.S. base in Germany 
where they were subjected to intense interrogation by U.S. 
agencies before being allowed to contact their friends in the 
Libyan opposition. 
  Libya, however, has denied any connection with the 
assassination of the Jordanian diplomat and has described 
reports linking it with the incident as an attempt to undermine 
its relations with Jordan.

  [Excerpt] Informed political sources have said Kuwait is 
most likely the Arab capital to which His Majesty the King 
referred in his speech to the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  The sources base this conclusion on information which said 
that the killers of the late Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah belong to 
Fatah-the Revolutionary Council organization, led by Abu-Nidal 
[Sabri al-Banna]. Abu-Nidal left Libya after the Gulf War and 
decided to settle in Kuwait after he established new links with 
the Gulf states. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nasrallah Urges the Palestinian </F>
People To `Destroy 'Arafat'"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Hizballah has commemorated 
the second anniversary of the assassination of its Secretary 
General 'Abbas al-Musawi and the 10th anniversary of the death 
of Shaykh Raghib Harb. It held a speech rally in Bi'r Hasan 
attended by an Islamic Republic of Iran delegation represented 
by its ambassadors to Lebanon and Syria, Homayun 'Ali Zadeh and 
Mohammad Akhtari-Forughi, and by Lebanese and Palestinian 
deputies and religious, military, and partisan figures, and 
others. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic 
Jihad 
Movement in Palestine," made a speech in which he said that the 
"resistance men insist on defeating Israel." He criticized 
those "who drink toasts with murderers and who speak of future 
normalization." [passage omitted] 
  At the end, Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah 
spoke. He said that "the resistance, whose leaders they killed 
in order to destroy it, is now stronger, firmer, and more 
solid." He reaffirmed that "our firm choice and absolute 
conviction is that the resitance is the only way to regain the 
territories and the holy places and to make real and precious 
peace. We will complete that journey most strongly and will not 
be deterred by Zionist terrorist methods or the continuous 
threats of a new war or annihilation of Hizballah." 
  He asked "is it not time for everyone to give up their bet 
on 
negotiations which can only produce an Israeli peace on Israeli 
terms?" He criticized the United States for reneging on the 
commitments announced at the Geneva summit, and he also 
criticized the "Gaza-Jericho first" and Cairo agreements. He 
charged that Israel "has not abandoned the option of separate 
solutions so that it would move quickly to impose its terms on 
the Palestinian side with the presence of a traitor like 
(Palestinian President) Yasir 'Arafat who is making endless 
concessions." 
  He urged "the Palestinian people to intensify their 
revolution and uprising and to work seriously for the downfall 
of the treasonous Zionized leadership of which 'Arafat is the 
black symbol, and even to destroy it and, by doing so, abort all 
the humiliating agreements." 
  He called on all the peoples of the region to "uphold the 
great resistance option in order to put an end to the 
occupation, especially in Lebanon." He appealed to "all the 
Lebanese to join the ranks of the resistance." He thanked Iran 
and Syria for their positions and criticized the "Lebanese 
Government and the official silence" about what is taking place 
in the south. He said: "That government is the biggest 
absentee in relation to all national issues." He added: "Did 
you not notice the great official interest shown in the incident 
of the execution of the murderer who had committed his 
abominable crime in Ba'labakk (Husayn 'Awwadah) carried out by 
agreement among the families concerned which adhered to a known 
Shari'ah rule and carried it out immediately to prevent 
sedition, at a time when there was terrible official silence 
about the horrible Israeli aggressions in the south and in 
western al-Biqa'? Is that government performance not considered 
to be an encouragement and a complementary factor to the 
aggression?" 
  He criticized the way the government addresses the 
steadfastness of the southerners and the economic and social 
issues as well as the issue of the return of the evacuees. He 
also criticized it for "keeping in flux the investigation into 
the 13 September massacre" (the al-Ghubayri incident) and he 
challenged the government to hold a referendum to determine its 
popularity.

in Aden: "Aden: Socialist Party Talks About Foiling Attempt To 
Shoot Down al-Bid's Plane"] 
  [Excerpt] Military sources in Aden have confirmed that the 
city's military intelligence (which is controlled by the Yemeni 
Socialist Party) [YSP] recently "uncovered a plot to shoot down 
the civilian aircraft scheduled to take Presidential Council 
Vice Chairman and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
his party's delegation from Aden to Amman in the next few days 
to sign the Pledge and Accord Document." 
  They accused some central security elements attached to the 
northern governorates and working at the Radfan Camp overlooking 
Aden airport of preparing to carry out the mission of attacking 
al-Bid's plane with "shoulder-fired RPG shells" when it takes 
off from the airport. 
  They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli, 
governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered 
the expulsion of the northern members of central security from 
Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to 
carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft." 
  Furthermore, military sources in Aden say that "the forces 
deployed in al-'Anad camp (80 km north of Aden) arrested two 
Iraqis in the evening of the day before yesterday as they tried 
to infiltrate the camp, which has a military airfield and some 
installations." They added that "the Iraqis, who came from the 
northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to 
damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in 
the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the Gaza Strip yesterday, 
the bodies of three Palestinians were found, all apparently 
killed because they were suspected of working as informants for 
Israel, Palestinian reports said. 
  One of the three was identified as 'Abd-al-Rahman Zino, a 
37-year-old ambulance driver from Gaza City. Zino, the father 
of nine, was abducted from his home last Friday. 
  Fatimah Abu-'Awdah, 55, from the town of Khan Yunus, was 
dragged out of her home by masked Palestinians and then shot 
several times. 
  The third was Qadir Dalamli, a 35-year-old taxi driver from 
Gaza City, kidnapped by masked men on Thursday. 
  Arab reporters said Dalamli's dismembered body was found 
outside his home inside a garbage bag. 
  The reports said Dalamli was believed to have been a drug 
dealer as well as an informer. 
  No group has claimed responsibility for the killings.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Abu-Nidal's Group Denies Death of </F>
Its Leader"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Fatah-the Revolutionary Council 
[FRC], which is led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna], yesterday 
denied what it described as "reports distributed by Algerian 
intelligence" claiming that its leader had died. It attacked 
the ruling authorities in Algeria and accused them of "being in 
the lap of the Jewish-Zionist-crusade movement." 
  The denial came in a statement signed by Husayn Bin-'Ali, a 
spokesman for Abu-Nidal's group, a copy of which was received by 
AL-HAYAH, days after that group was accused of assassinating a 
Jordanian diplomat in Beirut. The statement did not indicate 
the whereabouts of Abu-Nidal, whose group has also been accused 
of carrying out terrorist operations in Western and Arab 
countries. 
  The group said that it was optimistic when Major General 
Liamine Zeroual assumed the presidency in Algeria, "but we were 
surprised" when the media, subservient to the Algerian regime, 
continued "to escalate their false allegations." It added that 
Algerian intelligence, which is headed by General Tawfiq, 
"distributed a number of reports targeting our movement to 11 
Arab countries." It pointed out that the wording of the reports 
differed from one country to another, saying in part that 
"Abu-Nidal has died and a group of people linked to the 
authorities of a certain Arab country occupied the movement's 
headquarters," and that "the movement, in cooperation with some 
terrorist Islamic fundamentalist forces, intended to implement a 
certain plan" in some Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan. 
  The group sees "these fabrications as being Jewish-Zionist 
fabrications," and said that it has "accurate knowledge" of the 
circumstances of the emergence of the Algerian intelligence and 
security organs "which grew up in the laps of the 
Jewish-Zionist-crusade movement." 
  It further said that "these lies and fabrications are part 
of 
the large-scale campaign aimed at Judaizing the nation, 
containing its masses, and weakening the resolve of the nation's 
masses and of a number of Arab countries." In conclusion, it 
"rejected civil wars and fragmentation of the nation."

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Fifty-five Islamic 
fundamentalists went on trial in western Algeria Saturday 
charged with "terrorist" offences and smuggling weapons into the 
country, judicial officials said. 
  The group, which officials said operated out of Maghnia on 
the border with Morocco and which includes 22 defendants being 
tried in their absence, is charged with smuggling arms into the 
country and helping repatriate via Morocco Algerians who fought 
for Afghan guerrilla groups against Soviet troops. 
  The trial is being heard in Oran before one of Algeria's 
three special courts responsible for trying "terrorism and 
subversion" cases. 
  The group is charged with "forming armed terrorist groups, 
holding and selling weapons and explosives, and threatening the 
security of the state." 
  Since they were set up a year ago, the three courts have 
handed down more than 4,000 sentences, including 420 death 
penalties. 
  Meanwhile security authorities here said six armed 
fundamentalists were killed by government forces Thursday and 
Friday in various parts of Algeria. 
  An armed gang had killed a teacher Tuesday while he took a 
class in a village near Jijel, northeast Algeria, the 
authorities said. 
  Islamic fundamentalists launched a guerrilla war against 
Algerian authorities in December 1991 after the government 
voided general elections which the since-outlawed Islamic 
Salvation Front was poised to win.

  [Text] According to a senior Egyptian official, the U.S. 
ambassador in Cairo told the Egyptian prime minister: "The U.S. 
Administration has received information that terrorist groups 
are planning to carry out attacks against U.S. tourists in 
Egypt." 
  The official says this information was behind an alert the 
United States issued to its citizens concerning the possibility 
of attacks against them. The Egyptian prime minister told the 
U.S. ambassador that Egypt's competent authorities have no 
information or evidence in this regard. The prime minister 
asked the ambassador to provide the Egyptian Government with any 
information that Washington has on this so that the two 
countries might cooperate in facing any possible threat to 
tourists. Washington and Cairo are holding consultations on 
this issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah and 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im] </F>
  [Excerpt] The mysterious "Islamic Group" statement warning 
and threatening foreigners in Egypt has drawn many reactions. 
In an exclusive statement to AL-'ARABI, Muslim Brotherhood [MB] 
Spokesman Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi dismissed the statement of 
the so-called Islamic Group as "a stupid statement issued by an 
unenlightened quarter." The statement is unacceptable from all 
religious and human aspects because it harms the interests of 
the country, he said. 
  A person describing himself as a leader of the so-called 
Islamic Jihad Organization telephoned AL-'ARABI and strongly 
denounced Tal'at Qasim's statement, saying it provides an excuse 
for attacking Islamic groups. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, official press spokesman </F>
of the Islamic Group abroad, by Hisham Mubarak, in Denmark; date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Mubarak] What were the pressures that made you 
leave Peshawar and seek asylum in Denmark? 
  [Qasim] The pressure began after an article appeared in the 
magazine AL-MURABITUN in which I criticized Saudi Arabia for 
refusing entry to pilgrims from countries that supported Iraq 
during the occupation of Kuwait. I also wrote several articles 
criticizing the Al Sa'ud rule. Saudi Arabia issued an order to 
the relief organizations operating in Afghanistan to stop 
supporting al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [the Islamic Group, IG]. The 
Saudi Government officially asked Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif to extradite me to Egypt and the Egyptian Government. 
This information reached 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the 
Afghan Ettehad-e Eslami, who asked me to enter Afghanistan. He 
put a car and Muslim guards at my disposal. He also put my new 
house under guard. I found it difficult to move around. I then 
received an invitation from Denmark and I travelled there. I 
asked for political asylum and was granted it. 
  Before that, martyr 'Adli Yusuf, whose nom de guerre was 
"Abu-Suhayb" was the first to arrive in Afghanistan through 
Saudi Arabia in 1985. He was followed by martyr 'Abd-al-Fattah 
(Abu-al-Yusr) also through Saudi Arabia and then by 'Ali 
'Abd-al-Fattah and Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli. 
  As for Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri's group, some went to Saudi 
Arabia while he arrived in Afghanistan. At first, they were 
called "al-Muttahamun" [the accused] in the al-Jihad 
Organization case. They became acquainted with Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, a rich Saudi national who believes in the idea of 
al-Jihad. He trusted them and together they established the 
"al-Qa'idah" [the base], a guesthouse for receiving those 
wishing to join the Afghan jihad. They called themselves the 
(Jama'at al-Jihad) from that time. 
  [Mubarak] There are reports about uninterrupted contacts 
between the IG and the U.S. Administration and its Embassy in 
Cairo. Can you explain to us what went on in these contacts? 
  [Qasim] This is no different from the issue of dialogue with 
the government. We did not contact the U.S. Embassy. All these 
reports of such contacts are lies. I can confirm that no 
contacts have been held on any level with the U.S. Embassy. It 
was the Americans who asked for contact but we refused it. 
  [Mubarak] It is not important who began the contacts but 
what 
happened in them? 
  [Qasim] There were no contacts. There were attempts on their 
part, which we rejected. 
  [Mubarak] How were these attempts made? 
  [Qasim] The first attempt with me was made following my 
release in 1988 and my escape for the first time from the 
sentries around my house. A lawyer came and asked for an 
appointment because some foreigners wanted to meet 
me--correspondents and officials from human rights organizations 
in their countries. The first was a U.S. correspondent, the 
second was the chief editor of a Yugoslav magazine, and the 
third was the first secretary in the Swiss Embassy. I began by 
asking them: Why are you interested in meeting me? The Swiss 
emphasized that the aim was to learn the violations to which the 
IG and its members were subjected in prisons so as to inform his 
government, which would then pressure the Egyptian Government. 
The American and the Yugoslav said the meeting was important to 
them as correspondents and because they recognized me as a 
source of information on what was happening in Egypt. I 
explained to them in detail the violations, torture, and 
detention to which the IG members were subjected. The dialogue 
went no further. 
  [Mubarak] Were other attempts made? 
  [Qasim] The same lawyer came and asked for an appointment 
for 
the U.S. correspondent. I refused and asked him to tell the 
American to send a photocopy of what he published about our 
first meeting in which I spoke about human rights violations so 
that I might see the result of the meetings. Otherwise, why 
should we meet again? 
  [Mubarak] But these attempts were made by correspondents. 
What about the U.S. Embassy? 
  [Qasim] The only time the embassy tried was following my 
arrest and while I was in prison at the end of 1988. The 
attempt was made through the same lawyer. He told me that the 
embassy's political officer wanted to meet me. I was surprised 
because how could he meet me when he knew I was in prison. The 
lawyer stressed that the official said he himself would solve 
it. I told the lawyer to ask him first: What do you want from 
this meeting? When the lawyer returned, he said the official 
wanted the following: 
  1. To get acquainted with me personally. 
  2. To be assured that we did not regard the United States as 
"the great satan." 
  3. To stress to the IG, represented in my person, that the 
Egyptian Government does not use the U.S. aid reaching Egypt to 
strike at the Islamic movement. 
  My answer was to refuse a meeting. We do not meet officials 
from governments. And for us, the United States is the major 
enemy, just like Israel. 
  [Mubarak] Why has the IG carried out acts of violence 
against 
tourism? 
  [Qasim] There are several reasons for the attacks on 
tourism: 
  First, tourism represents a massive source of illicit 
[haram] 
state revenue. This revenue provides the ruling regime with 
financial resources that help it to stay in power. We believe 
the regime should be removed. So, we decided to strike at this 
activity to deprive the regime of this revenue and hasten its 
demise. According to statistics, the annual income generated by 
tourism is &pound;3.2 billion [about $1 billion]. The 
government's 
own reports admit that a limited number of operations by the 
Islamic groups, which cost us nothing, have undermined this 
illicit revenue. 
  Second, tourism in its current form is pure evil. It is an 
activity through which prostitution and AIDS are being spread, 
particularly by female Jewish tourists. It is a despicable 
source of a host of abominations. Tourism is also a way for 
foreign intelligence services to collect information about the 
Islamic movement. So, tourism is a certified evil and must be 
terminated. 
  [Mubarak] But these acts of violence that you committed 
involved murder. Tourists were killed. What does the 
government have to do with this? 
  [Qasim] Some tourists should not be killed. The target of 
our campaign is tourism, not tourists. We have taken several 
measures to protect the lives of tourists. We have issued 
several statements warning tourists against coming to Egypt, 
where their lives will be endangered. We have said that whoever 
visits Egypt subjects himself to danger because of our campaign 
against the tourism sector. We have also sent messages to the 
competent authorities warning them against inviting tourists for 
these reasons. Having done all this, those tourists who still 
visit the country are doing so at their own risk. 
  [Mubarak] You said tourism is pure evil and a source of 
abomination. This is one of the reasons you cite for the 
attacks against the tourism sector. But AIDS and drugs are not 
a result of tourism. There are countries that have no tourism 
but in which drugs and AIDS are widespread. 
  [Qasim] The Egyptians did not use drugs before the start of 
the tourism boom. I agree that tourism may not be the sole 
cause for the spread of drugs but it is a major factor. Press 
reports have repeatedly linked tourism with drugs, AIDS, and 
espionage. 
  [Mubarak] Suppose, for the sake of argument, that tourism 
was 
the reason for the spread of AIDS and drugs as you say and that 
it is an abomination that should be changed. Why did you decide 
to strike at tourism only last year when we know that the 
tourist areas are centered in Upper Egypt, where, historically, 
your influence has always been. There must be other reasons 
prompting you to strike at tourism. Otherwise, why did you keep 
silent about this evil? You have existed since the 
mid-seventies. 
  [Qasim] Tourism is basically permissible if it is conducted 
according to Islamic rules. But if a war is raging, then why 
should the tourists come to these areas when they know they are 
in danger, unless there are other reasons making them come. 
  [Mubarak] For some time, we have seen reports of divisions 
and splits within the IG, especially after the tourism 
incidents, when some dissident leaders rejected this tactic. 
This analysis is confirmed by the calm in several governorates, 
such as al-Minya and Suhaj, where the IG has a strong influence 
and yet refused to participate in this conflict against the 
security organs. What is your view? 
  [Qasim] There are no differences or splits on any leadership 
or base level inside the IG. There are no differences over 
tourism or any other issue concerning some governorates' 
nonparticipation in striking at tourism. There are two reasons 
for this: 
  1. Reasons that concern the government. The regime cannot 
open several fronts simultaneously. It has not succeeded in the 
battle it started in Dayrut and will be unable to decide this 
battle even with the forces it has brought in from Cairo and the 
areas surrounding Dayrut. So, the regime prefers not to start 
new battles now. 
  2. Reasons that concern the IG. We have not decided upon a 
comprehensive confrontation. What is happening now is 
preparation, only "a heating up." It is in our interest at the 
preparatory stage to maintain bases in calm governorates so that 
they can operate calmly in accordance with the plan prepared for 
them and achieve what is required of them. Briefly, we are the 
ones who will decide when and who will move. These governorates 
are required to remain calm. Their role has not come yet. 
  [Mubarak] You issued a statement saying that investments 
will 
soon be the target of IG operations. When will you carry out 
violent acts against investments? 
  [Qasim] The timing for striking at investments depends on 
several circumstances. These include the nature of the Egyptian 
security organs' performance against us and then our assessment 
of the conflict with the state. If the state opts for a new 
escalation against the IG, then the investment sector will be 
the target of revenge as a kind of deterrent. 
  [Mubarak] In which case, you will not have the religious 
grounds you cited for the attacks on tourism. What are your 
reasons for the campaign against investment? 
  [Qasim] We seek to destroy all the state organs and 
facilities with the least possible bloodshed. The task is easy. 
A single IG military unit can strike at investment in Egypt 
when the time is right. 
  [Mubarak] The military operations you directed against 
tourism have cost you a lot. The security organs have 
eradicated the IG influence in many areas. Most of the major IG 
leaders are in jail. Did the IG make an error of judgment when 
it took its struggle against the state to the highest level with 
the attacks on such an important sector as tourism? 
  [Qasim] I beg to differ with your use of the term the 
highest 
possible level. What has happened in our struggle with the 
state is very limited and only in line with the stages we adopt 
in our effort to weaken the state. This is just a prelude to an 
all-out confrontation. The current level of confrontation is 
only the beginning. The major struggle has not begun. Besides, 
the security organs have no clue as to the IG structure. For 
example, the recurring announcement by security officials that 
they have eliminated 99 percent of IG members contradicts the 
daily press reports about the arrests of dozens, even hundreds, 
of people. 
  [Mubarak] I feel that with your campaign against tourism you 
have launched a losing, even suicidal, battle. The ensuing 
security efforts have undercut your operations. 
  [Qasim] The IG is still alive and will remain unshaken. All 
the security strikes have been ineffectual. At any rate, our 
religious duty is to engage in jihad, not to reach a particular 
outcome. We take the right path and God Almighty decides on the 
outcome. We do what the shari'ah tells us to do with regard to 
establishing the Islamic state. If the outcome is victory, that 
is fine with us. If it is death, that too is fine. 
  [Mubarak] There have been reports about a dialogue between 
yourself and the security officials following your release in 
1988. What was that about? 
  [Qasim] First, there was no dialogue involved, despite 
recent 
reports concerning a mediation committee. When I was under 
house arrest after my release in 1988, Major General Sa'id 
Thabit of the Internal State Security Service summoned me and 
told me the acts of violence waged by the IG in south Egypt, 
'Ayn Shams [a Cairo suburb], and other areas must end. I stated 
the IG's conditions for ending violence. They are: 
  1. IG detainees and prisoners should be released. 
  2. Propagation activities should be legalized. IG mosques 
must not be sequestered. 
  3. Torture and the holding of hostages should be ended. 
  The security official did not agree. On the contrary, they 
strengthened the guard during my house arrest in 1988. After 
fleeing my house and my arrest in 1989, the same official came 
back and asked me to stop the violence, particularly in 'Ayn 
Shams, which has witnessed a noticeable escalation in the IG 
operations against the police. I repeated what I said about the 
conditions I mentioned. Again, these were rejected. That is 
the story. There was no dialogue. There will not be one. 
  [Mubarak] But there are confirmed reports that a mediation 
committee of religious scholars was coordinating and organizing 
the dialogue between the IG leaders in prison and security 
officials and that that was the reason the government dismissed 
Interior Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Musa, a party to the dialogue. 
  [Qasim] There was no dialogue. Apart from what I said 
earlier, no IG leaders inside the prison or outside have met 
religious scholars or security officials. The mediation story 
was fabricated. We issued a statement dismissing the idea of 
dialogue or mediation. Our position is clear in this regard. 
There can be no truce or reconciliation with the regime. The 
issue is confrontation between the two parties until one 
finishes the other off or the Islamic system is fully applied. 
  [Mubarak] Does this mean the IG insists on rejecting any 
dialogue designed to stop the bloodshed and violence? 
  [Qasim] We will enter no dialogue unless one of two cases 
applies: 
  1. It is dialogue with the state security and government 
shaykhs and ulema with a view to dismissing the suspicions they 
raise occasionally about our ideology. This is our duty and we 
call for it. 
  2. In the event of our achieving power, we might negotiate 
with the key figures of the outgoing authority about the 
conditions for their exit from the country. 
  [Mubarak] But the information indicates that 'Abbud al-Zumur 
was a party to the dialogue. 
  [Qasim] This never happened. What was reported was untrue 
and denied by 'Abbud al-Zumur. 
  [Mubarak] What about press reports attributed to Safwat 
'Abd-al-Ghani regarding the mediation committee in which he 
confirms the existence of a dialogue? 
  [Qasim] First, Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani's statements were 
distorted. Second, I am the one who officially expresses the 
IG's positions. I only discussed the mediation issue to deny 
its existence. 
  [Mubarak] Many observers believe the IG has lost on every 
level and that the security services have eliminated its threat. 
What do you think? 
  [Qasim] This is wrong. At the military level, although the 
all-out confrontation has not started, and the struggle is still 
at its preparatory stage, the state has failed to decide a 
single battle. The Dayrut battle has not been decided, despite 
the massive forces brought in from the other governorates. 
Indeed, the IG members in Dayrut exhausted the government 
strength and confused its forces. Military superiority favors 
the IG. We maintain a presence in 18 governorates and their 
scores of towns and hundreds of villages. The state has failed 
to decide even a small battle in one of the 13 towns of Asyut 
Governorate. And Asyut is only one of 18 governorates in which 
we are present. 
  On the political level, the state is suffering various 
political crises. The political forces' rejection of Mubarak's 
nomination is perhaps the best example. On the economic level, 
simple strikes that cost us nothing enable us to obstruct the 
tourism sector; the state is suffering an economic crisis that 
has been deepened by tourism problems. 
  The various levels of struggle have added to the IG's 
firmness. 
  I conclude from this that the IG's curve is going upward, 
contrary to what some people imagine. 
  [Mubarak] I disagree. First, the IG's mosques, known for 
their active role, have been taken by the government. Second, 
you give government failure to decide the battle in Dayrut as 
evidence that the IG is still strong. But the government ended 
your influence in many other regions, like Imbabah, 'Ayn Shams, 
Qina, Aswan, and Damietta. The IG does not exist there. The 
IG's armed elements were liquidated, as many members were 
killed. Finally, that arrivals from Afghanistan are being used 
means the IG is using its last line of defense. 
  [Qasim] This is not true. Statements by security leaders 
indicate that we have killed more of them than they have killed 
of us since 1981. What you said about government successes in 
regions like Aswan, Imbabah, and Qina is not true either. 
Although in the past we used mosques to propagate the message, 
we did not stop when the government controlled the mosques. The 
IG invented methods to continue its activity, such as using 
direct video transmission, audio cassettes, and various 
publications. And educating members in apartments instead of 
mosques--because of the security situation--allows us to 
intensify our programs. In short, our activity is continuing 
but the methods and means have changed. The participation of IG 
members in Afghanistan in the current struggle in Egypt was 
intended from the beginning. Those members were scheduled to 
return anyway. Your thinking that they are the last line is 
wrong; they are just the beginning of the struggle. Anyway, I 
won't go into more detail about this point. 
  [Mubarak] What are the IG's poles of action now? 
  [Qasim] There are three poles of action. These are: 
  1. The military coup: 
  Work on this level is afoot. The state knows nothing about 
it and its security organs are preoccupied with minor incidents 
carried out by IG youths in Upper Egypt. 
  2. The mass action: 
  When the Islamic revolution takes place, it must be 
accompanied by a widespread mass action. This is vital to 
prevent foreign intervention, or at least to have the action 
impede intervention for 18 days, according to our military 
people. Many of the demonstrations we organized were meant, 
among other things, to train the IG cadres in mass action. We 
have expertise in this field. 
  3. The special operations axis: 
  This action is necessary to assassinate some officials. It 
is the stage of heating things up. This organ has gained 
expertise by implementing operations. It is ready now and has a 
role in implementing the plan. This organ is in action and will 
not stop the assassination acts as long as there are 
circumstances that require them. It is wrong for anyone to 
think that the arrest of its members or the halting of its 
activities for some time means an imbalance. Action is taken in 
accordance with a plan drawn up for this organ's work. 
  The state knows nothing about the military organ that is 
responsible for preparing the military coup. It knows nothing 
about the special operations organ. When some of its members 
are arrested, they only know about their group, which is no use 
to the security forces, since the group is completely separate 
and has no links with the other groups. 
  [Mubarak] I feel you are exaggerating the military action. 
We have not heard about military groups belonging to the IG and 
the intelligence service has arrested no elements affiliated to 
you. What proof do you have? 
  [Qasim] The events of 1981 [the killing of al-Sadat] answer 
you. The security organs had no idea about the IG's military 
wing. This is the most convincing answer. The arrest or 
nonarrest of military elements does not mean there are or are 
not military groups. Generally speaking, there were military 
people in the al-Jihad case. 
  [Mubarak] The military who left service or were accused in 
the al-Jihad case were officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers. They had no influence. Supposing that what you say 
about a presence in this sector is true, this does not mean 
there is any real danger. What do you think? 
  [Qasim] I beg to differ with you. The influential forces are 
the minor officers and the situation in the military units 
confirms this. Soldiers do not get their orders from 
high-ranking officers such as a brigadier general and above. We 
are convinced of the importance of the lower ranks. This is a 
lesson from history. They are the motivators. 
  [Mubarak] What are the details of the coup plan you prepared 
in 1981 and whose spark was the attack on the reviewing stand 
[on President al-Sadat]? 
  [Qasim] The plan was based on several axes: Military action 
to seize control of the main centers, such as the operations 
room, the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the 
television and radio building, and the important bridges. The 
plan also called for the issuance of fabricated statements 
attributed to various army units expressing support for the 
Islamic revolution in order to confuse the Army Command and 
paralyze its activity. At the same time, armed elements would 
move to kill some influential state figures or those who would 
attempt to ride the popular wave. The people would then go down 
to the streets to prevent foreign intervention. We also had an 
alternative plan that was to be implemented in an emergency. 
This is the one that was carried out in 1981 after the arrest 
of a number of leaders, including myself, during the September 
campaign. 
  The organization decided to implement the emergency plan for 
fear that the security service may have learned about the 
organization after our arrest. The emergency plan was amended 
after we learned that Khalid al-Islambuli has been selected to 
participate in the military parade. The leadership was hesitant 
whether to go ahead with the plan to assassinate al-Sadat or 
not. The brothers in Cairo decided to carry out the 
assassination plan, and that the shots to be fired by 
al-Islambuli would herald the start of the revolution and the 
movement in Cairo and Asyut. Usamah Hafiz was asked to travel 
to Upper Egypt to inform the other leaders about the plan. But 
he could not get to Asyut because the police had established 
checkpoints along the road. Usamah was forced to change his 
itinerary. Therefore, the assassination operation came as a 
surprise to the Upper Egypt leaders. They thought that the fact 
that they had not received information about the assassination 
plan meant that the plan has been postponed. They waited for 
two days in order to prepare for the movement that began on the 
first day of the holiday. They succeeded in seizing control of 
the Asyut Governorate and the security directorate. But the 
security forces were able after many hours to regain control of 
the governorate, and the plan failed in Cairo. 
  [Mubarak] How did Khalid al-Islambuli join the IG? 
  [Qasim] Khalid is the younger brother of Muhammad Shawqi 
al-Islambuli, one of the founders of the IG. Muhammad invited 
him to join the group, and he did. He began attending the 
weekly meetings we held in al-Rahmah Mosque. We decided to 
accept him as a member, and I was his amir in the Naja' Hammadi 
group. He was full of enthusiasm. He asked me more than once 
to give him permission to direct his unit's guns at the 
presidential palace where al-Sadat lived. He was an officer in 
the Artillery Corps. I used to calm him down, and hinted to him 
that something was being prepared and he should wait. Later I 
included Khalid in the group responsible for carrying out the 
coup.

  [Text] A leading figure in the extremist groups has 
addressed an appeal to terrorist elements in which he condemned 
the acts of violence taking place in Egypt. He called for a 
halt to all terrorist operations when the month of Ramadan 
begins, making this the starting point in the renunciation of 
violence and aggression. 
  Defendant Hasan al-Hallawi -- a leading figure in the 
Islamic 
Group who is currently serving a prison term in connection with 
the case of the Military Technical College and the murder of 
Lieutenant Colonel 'Isam Shams during the events that took place 
at the Adam Mosque in 'Ayn Shams in 1989 -- made these remarks 
when commenting on his colleagues' statements of the past few 
days, which promised more terrorist operations. In his message, 
which he sent to us from behind bars, al-Hallawi says that 
threatening to retaliate and murdering innocent and defenseless 
people, both Egyptians and foreigners, are not approved of by 
Islamic law, but are a distortion of jurisprudence and religion 
and the result of an erroneous understanding of the shari'ah. 
He urged terrorist elements to fear God and listen to the 
counsel of the sincere ulema in this regard. He added: Any 
party that fears talks has a weak argument, because dialogues 
are the path taken by sane people so long as there is an 
atmosphere of freedom, justice, and safety. 
  This open message to the terrorist groups is the first 
response and show of sympathy by a prominent figure in these 
groups. It shows the threat to them as a result of the 
successful blows security forces have dealt their leaders in the 
past week, in which they lost important cadres in their military 
wing. 
  It should be recalled that defendant Hasan al-Hallawi had 
escaped to and resided in an Arab country. He was among the 
elements responsible for sending money to their cadres in Egypt 
before he was arrested and deported to Egypt two months ago 
along with a group of his associates.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf Khalil] </F>
  [Text] The security forces managed by sheer chance to foil 
a new attempt to assassinate President Husni Mubarak when they 
raided hideouts of the Islamic groups in al-Ma'sarah, Hulwan, 
and al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' over the past three weeks. Nine 
members of the groups were charged with the attempt and have 
been referred to the military court in criminal case No. 2 of 
1994 in Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, where the attempt was to 
have taken place when President Mubarak intended to visit Libya. 
The defendants managed to plant explosive charges in two 
important places: the airport and the VIP lounge where President 
Mubarak is used to staying. 
  One of the casualties in the raid on al-Ma'sarah-Hulwan made 
detailed confessions under the influence of drugs while he was 
in surgery. Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi Abd-al-Baqi, one of the 
defendants in the attempt, was killed when the security forces 
raided the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' hideout last week. 
  It is worth noting that the Sidi Barrani court held its 
first 
hearing on this case on 30 January. It will hold another 
hearing next week. A retired judge has been summoned to chair 
the trial. He previously passed a verdict in a military case.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, Feb 11 (AFP)--Egyptian security forces 
recently foiled a bid by Islamic militants to assassinate 
President Husni Mubarak, a pro-fundamentalist newspaper reported 
here Friday. 
  AL-SHA'B said nine militants of the outlawed al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group, IG] group, currently on trial in a 
military court, planted explosives at Sidi Barrani airport near 
the Libyan border and at Mubarak's residence at the town's 
military base. 
  They planned to detonate them during a visit by Mubarak, who 
holds regular meetings with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
at the base. 
  AL-SHA'B said the trial of the nine accused began in secret 
at the Sidi Barrani military court on January 30. 
  The plot was uncovered when an al-Jama'ah militant was 
arrested in a raid in the southern suburbs of Cairo on January 
19. The militant, who was wounded in the raid, made a full 
confession in hospital under the influence of drugs, the paper 
said. 
  It is the second assassination plot against Mubarak to be 
revealed by the opposition press in Egypt. In October two 
militants, among a group of 19 who planned to kill the Egyptian 
leader, were sentenced to death by the Alexandria high military 
court. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Asyut, 14 Feb (MENA)--Three unknown gunmen fired at 
a minibus in the al-Sadat area in the city of Asyut, Upper

  According to initial reports, the minibus was carrying 10 
passengers, two Egyptians and eight Romanian experts working at 
a cement factory in the region. 
  The culprits fired at the minibus using handguns; they 
caused 
damage to the right side of the minibus. 
  Officials of the Asyut Security Directorate, Public 
Security,

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Feb (MENA)--An Interior Ministry official 
source has stated that an initial inspection of the area where 
shots were fired at a minibus belonging to the Asyut Cement 
Plant in Asyut shows that six bullets were fired at the vehicle 
from the front and right sides, and that all of them were 
directed at the lower half of the bus. This meant that the 
persons who opened fire at the vehicle did not intend to harm 
any of the passengers, especially as the passengers were walking 
toward the bus and were about 20 meters from it, and no one 
attempted to intercept them. 
  The source explained that some workers had been dismissed 
from the plant, and it is possible that they may have carried 
out some actions in order to inflict damage on the plant. 
  The security source said that the Western media have 
hastened 
in an unprecedented manner to exaggerate the incident and guess 
at the identity of the perpetrators. These media did not find 
in the minibus anything to satisfy their desire to distort the 
state of security and stability in Egypt, so they reported that 
it was a tourist bus. 
  The source called on the Western media to be accurate in 
reports that could harm the country's interests. The source 
affirmed that the Interior Ministry issues accurate statements 
about any incident.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- A bomb planted by suspected 
militants seriously wounded four people in a shopping centre in 
a town north of here on Monday, police said. 
  The bomb, which went off outside a shop and wounded 
passersby 
in the town of Tanta, was similar to those seized during a 
police raid here two weeks ago in which seven members of the 
outlawed Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] were killed. 
  Two of the group's gunmen also fired on a bus carrying 
Romanian and Egyptian engineers in the southern city of Asyut on 
Monday, shattering windows but causing no injuries. 
  The Jama'ah said it carried out the shooting attack as part 
of its "campaign against foreign investors and tourists" and to 
avenge seven members killed in a February 1 police raid in 
Cairo, the group said in a statement to AFP. 
  The gunmen opened fire as the bus drove through Asyut, 380 
kilometers (230 miles) south of Cairo, on its way to a cement 
factory, police said. The engineers hit the floor when the 
shooting started and escaped injury. 
  The Jama'ah has warned foreigners to leave Egypt as part of 
a 
violent campaign against President Husni Mubarak's government 
which has killed almost 300 people. 
  The group said the shooting was the fifth attack it has 
carried out to "avenge the seven martyrs of al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra'," a poor Cairo neighborhood. Jama'ah has accused the 
police of gunning down the seven militants in cold blood.

  [Text] Bucharest, Feb 16 (AFP)--A group of Romanian 
engineers who survived a gun attack are to quit southern Egypt 
after receiving threats from the main Muslim fundamentalist 
group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, the Foreign Ministry said 
Wednesday. 
  The 20 Romanians working for a cement factory are to move 
from the southern Asyut region to the northern city of 
Alexandria until the situation calms down, ministry spokesman 
Mircea Geoana [name as received] said. 
  The engineers were on board a bus that was hit by gunfire on 
Monday near Asyut. They were unhurt, but the next day they 
received threats from the al-Jama'ah saying the shooting was 
only a warning. 
  The Egyptian authorities and the Romanian Embassy in Cairo 
were studying ways of protecting the 200 Romanians working in 
"sensitive" parts of the country, Geoana added.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 14 (MENA)--The supreme State Security 
Prosecution has ordered the detention for 15 days of members of 
extremist groups who are being interrogated. 
  The 12 were arrested and were found in possession of 
leaflets 
propagating ideas of Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Groups). 
  The leaflets also objected to interrogations being carried 
out with the Arabic weekly "AL-SHA'B," mouthpiece of the Labour 
Party. 
  Investigations revealed that the group were planning to 
provide hideouts for fugitive terrorist elements. 
  They were also found in possession of arms which they 
intended to use in terrorist operations.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA) -- [passage omitted] 
Yesterday's preemptive strike against a number of terrorists has 
confirmed that all branches of the security authorities are 
working within a framework of complete coordination and 
cooperation to confront these terrorists and place them under 
constant attack. The strike was also a message to other 
fugitive terrorists, warning them that any acts they might 
commit are doomed to fail, especially in light of the prevailing 
national unity and the complete popular support for the security 
agencies and all their actions. 
  This preemptive strike is the fourth of its kind to take 
place in the center of a heavily populated poor neighborhood, in 
which no citizen or policeman was hit. 
  The first blow was the arrest of nine terrorists who carried 
out the failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister on 25 
November, during which not a single shot was fired. They are 
currently being tried by a military tribunal. 
  The second blow was in the al-Ma'sarah incident during 
security sweeps in the area where two terrorists were killed and 
two others, one of whom was a Palestinian, were arrested. In 
this incident a dangerous terrorist named Tharwat Hajjaj managed 
to escape, only to meet his death yesterday along with two 
others in a clash in the al-Sayyidah Zaynab neighborhood. 
  The third blow was delivered in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' 
area 
late in January against terrorist hideouts, in which seven 
dangerous terrorists, known as the Asyut group, were killed and 
no civilians or security men were hit.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--An Interior Ministry security 
source has stated that while Nadi Raja'i Ahmad, a State Security 
detective with the rank of warrant officer, was returning home 
in Asyut at 2020 today, he glimpsed an individual at the end of 
the street leading to his house. He ordered him to halt but the 
latter fired a shot and fled. The warrant officer gave chase; 
exchanged fire with the suspect, hitting him in his left arm; 
arrested him, and seized his weapon. 
  The security source said that after the suspect was put 
through an identification process, it was discovered that he is 
'Atif 'Ali Farghali Ahmad, recently released from custody and 
formerly indicted in connection with several terrorist 
operations. He was transferred to the hospital for treatment 
and placed under armed guard. 
  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi ordered a &pound;500 reward 
for 
the warrant officer for his prompt use of his personal weapon to 
arrest the terrorist.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--An official security source at 
the Interior Ministry has stated that a primitive device placed 
outside one of the International Kuwaiti Alexandria Bank windows 
in Suriya Street in al-Jizah went off at 2015 today. The 
explosion shattered the window and the windshields of two cars 
parked opposite it; there was no other damage or casualties. 
  The security source said the device was primitively made and 
was similar to those made by children to make popping sounds. 
The source added that this proves that the act was only meant 
to attract media attention, which remnants of the deviants are 
trying hard to do to show that they still exist. 
  The source said that the security services are warning the 
deviants that they will face a strong and decisive 
confrontation. [passage omitted condemning terrorism] The 
security services will not hesitate to confront these attempts 
decisively. At the same time, the source said, all security 
services sense the people's confidence that the police will put 
an end to these petty criminal attempts, which show how weak the 
deviant terrorist groups are. 
  The security source said that Egypt's nationalist forces 
stand behind the security forces, defending by all means the 
culture and history of the nation. They will never allow a 
stray criminal group to sabotage the homeland.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--The Higher Military Court 
today held a hearing in the case involving the attempt to 
assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. Fifteen defendants, 
including six who are still at large, face charges. 
  At the beginning of the hearing, the defense asked that the 
case be adjourned until the investigation of the murder of the 
major prosecution witness in the case, car dealer al-Sayyid 
Yahya, is completed. The defense also asked that Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi appear in court to give evidence. 
  The presiding judge turned down the request for an 
adjournment, saying that the reasons the witness was killed have 
no bearing on the case. The court then heard the prosecution 
attorney, who defended the constitutionality of the trial in a 
military court, saying that the court is independent and 
unbiased. 
  The prosecution attorney said the group that mounted the 
attack recruited young people with the aim of sending them to 
Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen so as to fight 
communism. The young men were trained to use various weapons, 
particularly explosives. After the Afghanistan war, the group's 
leaders instructed members to return to their country and mount 
a jihad campaign against what they claim to be an ungodly 
society. 
  The military prosecution attorney said the group's leaders 
travel to and from Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and send 
their instructions by telephone and by mail to the group's 
members in Egypt. 
  The attorney said the centerpiece of the group's thinking is 
the assertion that society and its ruler are atheist. The 
group, he added, sanctions murder as a way to achieve its ends. 
  The prosecution attorney said the group's thinking is not on 
trial; the defendants are. The defendants joined a group formed 
on an unconstitutional basis, collaborated in crime, committed 
first-degree murder, owned unlicensed weapons and ammunition, 
and abetted fugitive criminals, he stated. 
  The attorney added that the defendants came to Egypt via 
Libya, Jordan, and Yemen, using forged passports and 
identification. They were instructed by their leadership abroad 
to attack public figures including the prime minister. Acting 
upon these instructions, they bought a car and blew it up as the 
prime minister's motorcade was passing but failed to meet their 
objective of killing the prime minister. The attorney said an 
innocent child was killed in the blast, other individuals were 
hurt, and several cars and buildings suffered damage. 
  Private citizens, including the owner of the car agency, 
chased the fifth defendant, Salah al-Sayyid Sulayman, and 
apprehended him. Sulayman's suspicious behavior and failure to 
pay the rest of the money due for the car led to his arrest, the 
attorney pointed out. The other defendants were arrested later, 
the attorney said. He then described the part played by each 
defendant in the case. 
  The attorney pointed out that Islam calls for criminals to 
be 
punished. Recalling the death of the innocent student in the 
blast, he requested that the most rigorous sentence, the death 
penalty, be passed on the defendants. 
  The court will hold another hearing on 26 February in which 
defense lawyers will present their case.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Pakistan Pumping in Arms"] </F>
  [Text] Srinagar, Jan 1 -- While on the one hand Kashmiri 
militants are avoiding direct confrontation with the security 
forces, switching over to hit-and-run tactics instead, there is 
a disturbing increase in sophisticated weapons being pumped into 
the Valley by Pakistan. 
  The recent hauls have ranged from 107mm artillery shells, 
fin 
stabilised 57mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm mortars, high 
velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic grenade 
launchers (AGLs), disposal rocket launchers, grenades of NATO 
origin, long-range high frequency sophisticated wireless sets 
with multi-mode facilities and even portable solar panels for 
charging batteries for the wireless sets. 
  Other gadgets include pen pistols of Japanese origin, 
silencers for both AK 56 assault rifles and 9mm pistols, 
telescope fitted `Dragnov' sniper rifles with infrared 
capability and a large variety of improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs). All this is in addition to the more conventional 
Kalashnikov series assault rifles, general purpose machine guns 
(GPMGs), rockets and rocket launchers, several types of 
grenades, anti-personal and anti-tank mines, and a wide range of 
revolvers/pistols and, of course, assorted ammunition, all of 
which have been recovered in mind-boggling numbers. For example, 
the quantum of explosives recovered by the army alone so far 
exceeded 6000 kg, with 2,500 kg having been recovered from a 
storage dump in one incident alone on December 6. 
  "We have recovered enough weapons from the Valley to equip 
an 
infantry division," says Lt. Gen. S. Pdmanaban, the corps 
commander at Srinagar. "But we have managed to produce a counter 
of militancy in all aspects of tactics and weaponry. In many 
cases we have anticipated it," he adds confidently. 
  Nevertheless, both the quantum and quality of weapons 
available to the Kashmiri and foreign militants not only 
indicates the level of Pakistani involvement in this strife-torn 
state but demonstrates the point that controlling terrorism in 
this scenic Valley will be a long haul yet. 
  Fortunately, however, the militants have not been equipped 
with rockets to launch either the 107mm shells or the 57mm 
rockets. But the security forces are aware that Pakistan might 
resort to desperate measures keeping in view the post Hazratbal 
systematic and calculated anti-militant mop-up launched by the 
security forces in the state on the one hand and the gradual 
public disillusionment with militancy on the other. 
  The army has discovered several specially constructed and 
deceptively located concrete underground bunkers in houses of 
active harbourers used by militants to hide both themselves and 
their weapons. For example, during the flushing out operation in 
Sopore, the army had recovered six bunkers in such houses. The 
bunkers fitted with small trap door entries were mostly located 
under the floor. In one case the trap door to such a bunker was 
located under the chullah in the kitchen. Another was behind a 
staircase, one in the field and yet another was in a narrow 
corridor-shaped false room. 
  The militants have been making effective use of wireless 
sets. Most outfits are equipped with short range walkie talkies. 
Sympathisers have also been provided these sets who have often 
compromised the army's movements in the Valley. About 150 
wireless sets have been recovered up till now. The more 
sophisticated ones with ranges of up to 300 km have been 
discovered to possess frequency hopping, selective broadcast, 
and digital burst communication facilities which are difficult 
to intercept. The sets recovered till now have been mostly of 
Japanese and U.S. origin. While `HAIFIS' is the common wireless 
set of U.S. origin, the Japanese sets have popularly been of 
Casio, Icom, Kempro and Yasev makes. 
  The solar panel, which is not yet available even with the 
Indian army, has been the most recent recovery. The U.S. made 
solar panel, recovered only two weeks ago, comes in a book form, 
one square foot in size, and is meant for recharging 
sophisticated sets requiring up to 18V output. The army has also 
recovered battery for these sets but has yet to recover the 
concerned wireless set. But a sleek wireless receiver of Sony 
make recovered recently was found to possess automatic scanning 
facility fitted with a display panel and an inbuilt microphone 
with the facility to monitor wireless communication of the 
security forces between 30 and 300 MHz. 
  The 107mm artillery shells, 57mm air-to-ground rockets and 
disposable rocket launchers are all of Russian origin and are 
suspected to be the leftovers of the Afghan war. The 107mm 
shells are being used as an IED, while the 57mm rocket popularly 
used by attack helicopters have been triggered with solar 
powered improvised direction giving devices. The above three 
weapons, as also the 60mm mortars, are all area weapons and 
capable of causing severe damage if fired on built up areas. 
Interestingly some of the two-inch mortar shells recovered from 
the militants have been found to have Indian ordnance markings.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "J&amp;K Militants Switch Tactics"] </F>
  [Text] Srinagar, Jan 4 -- Where till recently they enjoyed 
an overt mass support and could organise public demonstrations 
at will, militants in the Valley are now facing gradual public 
disillusionment and have switched over to hit-and-run tactics 
instead. 
  Apart from a rising tendency in inter-group clashes, there 
is 
growing evidence of criminality in militant ranks. Extortions 
from the public are on the rise as also is the harassment of 
women. The militant's gun, as had been the case in Punjab, is 
becoming the new symbol of power as well as access to easy 
money. Again, like in Punjab, the tactic is now to recruit youth 
at gunpoint. 
  The creation of a large number of pro-Pakistani militant 
groups indicates a growing tendency of internecine rivalry, 
mutual suspicion, and suspicion also on the part of Pakistan. 
"Pakistan is suspicious of the Kashmiri militants. That explains 
the growth of militant groups and the influx of mercenaries," 
says a senior intelligence official. 
  With most Pandits having fled the Valley, militants have 
turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on 
the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal 
scores or simple criminalisation. For example, over 1,700 
Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990 in contrast to 
about 350 Pandits killed in the same period. 
  About 4,000 private houses have been set afire, over 1,300 
schools and government buildings burned, about 1,100 persons 
have been abducted and another 1,450 odd shops gutted apart from 
a total 2,175 innocents killed by the militants. Till the end of 
1992 alone, there were 81 incidents of extortions and robbing of 
innocent persons and over 100 incidents of abductions and 
killings of civilians in the same period. 
  More significantly, like in Punjab, public response to bandh 
calls by militants has also been on the decrease. This trend has 
been on the rise after the Hazratbal problem was resolved 
peacefully and the cleansing operations carried out in Sopore, 
Baramulla and Anantnag, all erstwhile nerve centres of the 
militants. 
  For example, last month the residents of Bijbehara, which 
had 
witnessed nearly 50 deaths in BSF (Border Security Force) firing 
in last October, the local residents observed a week-long bandh 
in protest against the militant activities. In Kupwara, another 
militant stronghold, the imam of the local mosque prevented 
militants from addressing a congregation. 
  The most commonly practised tactic adopted by the Kashmiri 
militants has been "long-distance stand-off attacks."

  [Excerpts] The intelligence [and security] minister [`Ali 
Fallahian], in an interview with our correspondent today, 
revealed new details of the assassination plot on the 
president's life. 
  Giving some examples of the conspiracies hatched by global 
arrogance in various dimensions this year, Mr. Fallahian said: 
On the security dimension alone, during the current year 
[ending 20 March 94] the mercenaries of foreign powers smuggled 
about 24 bombs into the country. But thanks to the vigilance of 
the hidden imam's unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were 
discovered and 16 people were arrested. Unfortunately four of 
the said bombs exploded. [passage omitted] 
  When the main elements responsible for the plot to 
assassinate the president were arrested it became clear that 
they are individuals with notorious records, low belief or no 
belief at all, low morals, and corrupt. Some of them have were 
affiliated with mini-groups [reference to opposition groups]. 
Among the arrested people there is an individual who has had 
links with some foreign embassies.

  [Text] Information Minister Hojjat ol-Eslam who was 
speaking in an exclusive interview with HAMSHAHRI, revealed some 
facts about the foiled assassination attempt against the 
president on 1 February in the shrine of Imam Khomeyni, may his 
soul be sanctified. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Fallahian said: The person who intended to 
assassinate the president was Kurosh Nik-Akhtar whose surname 
used to be Kamare'i in the past. 
  The information minister said: In addition to arresting 
Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, who was apprehended because of the full 
awareness and prompt action of our courageous people on 1 
February, a large network of his accomplices and cohorts have 
been identified and arrested. 
  According to the information minister, more than 20 members 
of this network's nucleus who were either aware of the 
assassination plan or who cooperated with the terrorist, have 
been arrested. The information minister added: During the 
preliminary questionings, all the people who were arrested 
confessed their ominous and counterrevolutionary objectives. 
These confessions have shown that most members of the group 
were involved in many immoral and corrupt acts. 
  The general decision of the terrorists was to start shouting 
antistate and apparently revolutionary slogans in order to 
attract the attention of public opinion and to justify their 
counterrevolutionary movement by distracting the people. They 
intended to propagate their blind ideas in order to impress the 
Muslim nation with their terrorist act and to spread public 
mistrust toward high-ranking pious, revolutionary, and 
hard-working elements. 
  The information minister also stated that in order to ensure 
that the assassination plot would be as successful as possible, 
the suspects had held a coordination meeting the night before 
the attempt and had discussed the details of the plan. 
  The information minister said: There are persons among those 
who were arrested who were affiliated with atheist leftist 
groups and have a criminal record. 
  The criminal records and confessions by the suspects have 
shown to also have a record of drunkenness, moral corruption, 
and addiction.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Iran's Revolutionary Guards 
vowed on Tuesday that the death sentence against British author 
Salman Rushdie would be carried out. 
  The guards, in a statement published in Iranian newspapers, 
said the "fatwa" (Islamic decree) issued against Rushdie by 
Iran's late spiritual guide Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni five 
years ago was "irrevocable and would definitely be executed." 
  The Indian-born writer was condemned to death for his novel 
"The Satanic Verses," which was judged to blaspheme Islam. 
  "Rushdie has insulted the sentiments and beliefs of more 
than 
a billion Moslems and should be punished according to the 
fatwa," the statement said. 
  The Iranian official news agency said Monday on the fifth 
anniversary of the ruling that Rushdie was an apostate and 
should die. 
  "The sentence has to be carried out irrespective of whether 
the apostate repents or not," it said. 
  On Tuesday, Jomhuri-ye Eslami newspaper denounced Western 
support for Rushdie and called on "Islamic forces to kill him." 
  "It is time to assert the will of the Islamic world," said 
the daily, close to Islamic hardliners. "Islamic forces should 
eliminate Rushdie and strike a blow to the enemies of Islam." 
  The paper said that the verdict had been reaffirmed on its 
fifth anniversary by several Islamic associations here and the 
Khordad-15 religious foundation, which has put up a reward of 
more than $2 million on Rushdie's head. 
  British Prime Minister John Major said on Monday that Iran 
could not expect to enjoy "full and friendly relations" with the 
rest of the world until the sentence was lifted.

  [Excerpt] Tehran, Feb 16 (AFP) -- [passage omitted] In an 
interview with the TEHRAN TIMES on Wednesday, Iran's speaker of 
parliament 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri urged the West "not to stand by 
the wicked man who has hurt the feelings of over one billion 
Moslems," with his book. 
  "We advise Western countries not to spoil their relations 
with Iran because of the apostate Rushdie," he said. 
  Iran's present leaders have upheld the verdict and a 
religious foundation here has put a reward of more than $2 
million on Rushdie's head. 
  The speaker reaffirmed Khomeyni's "fatwa" (Islamic decree), 
saying Iran "would not retreat or make any changes in its 
position." 
  He accused Western countries of using Rushdie as a "weapon" 
to pressure the Islamic republic and urged Moslems to kill the 
author "whenever and wherever possible." However, he stressed 
Iran had no plans to send gunmen to kill Rushdie. [passage

they said, is the release of the 11 Iraqis now on trial in 
Kuwait in connection with a plan to assassinate former U.S. 
President George Bush. The sources said the regime also wants 
Kuwait not to refer to its prisoners as hostages or detainees, 
but as missing. 
  The sources said Kuwait responded through the Arab League, 
saying that the Iraqis who are now standing trial in Kuwait 
entered their country carrying weapons and bombs (?and tried to 
carry out) assassinations, bombings, and terrorist acts. They 
have confessed to this and are now in the hands of the Kuwaiti 
judiciary. The Kuwaiti captives, on the other hand, are 
prisoners and [words indistinct] because the tyrant's forces 
kidnapped them by force in front of their families and friends 
during the occupation.

<F P=106> [Interview with `Red Star' Militia Commander H.M.; place and </F>
date not given: "We Shall Continue Armed Action Until the 
Occupation Army and the Settlers Leave Our Land"--first 
paragraph is AL-HURRIYAH introduction] 
  [Excerpts] We met the fighter H.M. in a field near one of 
the villages of the occupied West Bank. He was introduced to us 
as one of the commanders of the `Red Star' brigades that operate 
against the Israeli occupation. He promised us to speak plainly 
and with figures. The following conversation with him took place. 
<H5>  Settlers Among Our Targets </H5>
  [AL-HURRIYAH] Yesterday an Egged bus belonging to settlers 
near Hebron; before it a group of settlers near al-Birah; before 
that Rabbi Druckman and the settler (Ephraim Ayyubi). Why have 
settlers now become a target of Red Star? 
  [Commander H.M.] Druckman is a leader of the extremist 
settlers, a former Knesset member, and a founder of the 
pro-settlement Gush Emunim. The settlers near al-Birah were 
among those responsible for killing the Palestinian student Rami 
al-Ghazzawi from al-Birah. The Egged bus was the transportation 
link between the settlement of Qiryat Arba' and Beersheba. They 
all fit into one context. 
  Whoever wants to chase the settlers from his land must fight 
them. The settlers will remain among our targets because they 
form the nucleus of colonial occupation and the reserve for 
military occupation. They run rampant as if they were masters of 
the land and we, their slaves, while the occupation army stands 
silent. They have mistreated our people, slain our sons, 
terrified our women and children, and attacked our property. 
They must leave this land at any cost. We have heard the whole 
world, with Yasir 'Arafat in its forefront, denounce the killing 
of the Israeli settler Hayyim Mizrahi and condemn the Fatah 
youths who carried out the heroic operation against the settler 
Mizrahi. This frightens no one, so much as it proves to us that 
we are on the right path. We don't think the occupation needs a 
pretext for repressing the people and throwing our sons into 
prison. We are in a state of war with the occupation. We don't 
think that laying down our arms will provide us with safety. 
Safety will be provided by the departure of the occupation and 
the settlers from our land. 
<H5>  Big Collaborators, Small Collaborators </H5>
  [AL-HURRIYAH] Compared with others in the field of 
operations 
to liquidate collaborators, you have the smallest number. What 
is the reason? 
  [Commander H.M.] The Red Star forces believe that every 
collaborator must meet his just desserts. They certainly are not 
lenient with collaborators, who harm many fighters and cause a 
large number of them to be killed by the soldiers of the 
occupation. Nevertheless, we in Red Star want to exercise care 
in dealing with collaborators and distinguish between "big 
heads" and "little heads." We think that punishing the big one 
is more useful than punishing the little one. Punishing big ones 
can serve as a lesson to the little ones. The little ones can be 
deterred by warning and by putting them under house arrest and 
surveillance. The big ones have passed the point of no return 
and must receive their punishment. 
  We make a decision about a collaborator only after gathering 
a sufficient amount of information, documents, and even pictures 
that prove his guilt. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HURRIYAH] The media has carried sensational accounts of 
the way in which you carried out the resolution to execute 
[alleged collaborator] Ahmad 'Awdah. How was it done? 
  [Commander H.M.] We wanted to use the same weapon with which 
'Awdah used to threaten the members of our people. He always 
used to carry his pistol at his side. We commissioned two of our 
comrades, who watched him until the right moment came. They 
grabbed the pistol from him and opened fire on him. So we also 
won over the gun in the service of our work against the Israeli 
occupiers. 
<H5>  Unfair, Unfounded Charges </H5>
  [AL-HURRIYAH] One force recently published a letter saying 
that you laid claim to operations that their fighters carried 
out, such as the operation against Rabbi Druckman, or the one 
against the settlers' car in al-Birah, or even the one against 
the customs bureau in Jerusalem. 
  [Commander H.M.] First, I would remind you that we could 
have 
used the same method that this group used in distributing 
letters and issuing communiques about the double claims to 
certain military operations against the Israeli occupation and 
settlers' livestock. But we preferred to remain silent, knowing 
well that this kind of information war is not in the interest of 
the intifadah or of those who wish to oppose the occupation. Our 
interest, besides escalating our operations, is to work to 
mobilize forces and join ranks. 
  Nevertheless, I can make a few quick observations. 
  This group charges that we claimed responsibility for the 
operation that set fire to a customs office in the center of 
Jerusalem, whereas a unit belonging to that group carried it out. 
  Unfortunately, the information is wrong. If it indicates 
anything, it indicates the truth of our position, our 
information, and our statements, and the falseness of the 
others' information and statements. On 23 October 1992, we 
announced our responsibility for setting fire to the customs 
warehouses, not a customs office, in the 'Atrot district in the 
heart of an industrial area in one of Jerusalem's suburbs, not 
in the center of Jerusalem proper, as the statement of this 
group says. Perhaps the person who drafted this statement, 
claiming to belong to the field of armed action, has no 
connection to armed action. I think my comrades in arms in the 
strike forces and armed groups are well aware and will agree 
with me that the operation against the Israeli customs 
warehouses was carried out only by Red Star's Martyr Ahmad 
al-Kilani group. 
  As for the Burqin operation near Nablus, which, according to 
this communique, targeted an Israeli military vehicle, I wish 
the author of the communique would show me a statement issued by 
Red Star about the operation. We did not claim responsibility 
for the operation because we never carried it out. 
  Regarding the operation against Rabbi Druckman, it was 
followed by the operation against settlers near al-Birah and the 
number 51 Egged bus operation near Hebron. 
  The force that issued the communique claimed responsibility 
for the first two operations, but not for the bus. Military 
observers commented that the bus operation was implemented in 
the same manner as the Druckman and al-Birah operations. We do 
not want testimony from military observers. Although, thank God, 
we lost none of our comrades in all these operations to capture 
or martyrdom, we are always concerned that no one claim our 
struggles and sacrifices for himself. 
  Two vivid examples come to mind. They provide sufficient 
proof. 
  On 29 March 1984, DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine] forces carried out a Land Day operation in the 
heart of Jerusalem. Although some heroic members of the group 
were captured or killed, one of the other groups claimed the 
operation for itself. Later it was forced to retract the claim 
because of irrefutable facts. That is one example. 
  Another example is the operation that targeted the settler 
Hayyim Mizrahi. The other group claimed responsibility for it by 
notarized communiques, but we discovered afterward that those 
who had carried it out were a group of Fatah youths who rejected 
their leaders' decision to halt the intifadah. I think these two 
examples are sufficient, without citing operations by the heroes 
of Islamic Jihad's Sword of Islam group for which others claimed 
responsibility despite the death of martyrs who everyone knew 
belonged to Islamic Jihad.

  [Text] Defense sources said they know nothing about a 
breakthrough over navigator Ron Arad and that Iran is 
responsible for his fate. The remarks were made after the 
REUTER correspondent in Beirut quoted a senior pro-Iranian 
source as saying that there are secret talks over Ron Arad and 
that a breakthrough is expected soon. The source added: We 
will receive something in return. He refused to say who is 
involved in the negotiations and where they are taking place, 
but other sources told REUTER that it can be assumed that 
Hizballah, Iran, Syria, and perhaps also the United States, are 
participating in the talks.

  [Excerpts] Gunmen carried out an attack on three Israelis 
this afternoon near Ramallah. The injured Israelis, who are 
members of the General Security Service [Shin Bet], were 
transferred to hospital, while security forces have been 
searching for the attackers. More from Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  The three Israelis were attacked near the entrance to the 
village of Baytuniya beside Ramallah and about 12 km north of 
Jerusalem. The indications are that there were two gunmen 
waiting in ambush. The Israelis drove by in a saloon car and 
came under a hail of automatic weapons fire. Dozens of bullets 
penetrated their vehicle. One of the men was mortally wounded in 
the head and chest, the other two were both injured by metal 
splinters in the head, and one was wounded in the shoulder, 
while his companion was injured in the hand. [passage omitted] 
  A curfew has been placed on Baytuniya, the surrounding area, 
and parts of Ramallah as the security forces try to find the 
perpetrators of this latest attack. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Network Channel 1 in Hebrew at 
1800 GMT on 13 February adds that "Hamas has claimed 
responsibility for the attack." Later in the newsreel, the 
anchor announces: "It has been just released for publication 
that 28-year-old Shin Bet member No'am Kohen from Jerusalem, who 
was wounded in the Baytuniya attack today, has died of his 
wounds."]

  [Excerpt] There is "more than one lead" in the hunt for the 
gunmen who killed General Security Service [GSS] agent No'am 
Kohen and wounded two other agents in Baytuniya on Sunday, OC 
Central Command Maj.-Gen. Yatom said yesterday. 
  Ramallah was under curfew for the second day, as reinforced 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units pressed to find more clues. 
Sources said it is now almost certain that the attackers knew 
who they were ambushing. 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] published a leaflet 
contending the attack was made possible through "a Hamas spy who 
infiltrated the GSS." The leaflet identifies the spy as A.A.H. 
  "A spy is the wrong term, but it is likely that a regular 
informant executed the attack, assisted by at least two others," 
one military source said. [passage omitted]

September, but Israel says the shelling could not have been

pointing an accusing finger at other elements. Operation 
Accountability ended in response to a U.S. effort to bring about 
a cease-fire. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
intervened personally with Israel and Syria to achieve the 
agreement. Israel's interpretation, therefore, is that the 
understandings were achieved with Syria, which is responsible 
for maintaining them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>
  [Text] The number of terrorist attacks in Jerusalem fell 
sharply in 1993 compared with 1992. This emerges from data 
released by Yehuda Wilk, commander of the Israel Police 
Jerusalem District, summing up the 1993 work year. 
  The severity of the attacks, however, did not change: three 
people were killed and 17 wounded in 1993 compared with three 
killed and 12 wounded in 1992. 
  The number of car torchings dropped significantly: 267 cars 
were set ablaze in 1993 compared with 448 in 1992. Stone 
throwing also decreased sharply: 2,731 incidents in 1993 as 
opposed to 3,640 in 1992. The same applies to firebomb attacks: 
64 in 1993 as opposed to 91 in 1992. 
  There were 24 stabbings and attempted stabbings in 1993 
compared with 27 in 1992. Three bombs were planted in 1993 
compared with 14 in 1992. The number of shooting incidents 
remained unchanged: five instances in both 1992 and 1993. 
  Commander Wilk attributed the drop in terrorist attacks to 
"aggressive intelligence methods adopted by the Jerusalem 
police." According to him, "terror-related problems cannot be 
solved by deploying huge numbers of policemen and are best 
handled by small intelligence teams." 
  In 1993, the Jerusalem police arrested 350 Arabs suspected 
of 
having participated in disturbances, including stone-throwing 
incidents; 15 suspected of hurling firebombs; and 60 suspected 
of torching cars.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 17 (AFP)--The Islamic Resistance 
Movement (HAMAS) offered Thursday to pardon any Palestinian 
collaborator if he kills his Israeli contact or helps in the 
murder. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the hardline Muslim 
fundamentalist group, said in a statement that it would give 
"protection and weapons" for "any repentant who kills his 
employer in the Israeli (secret) services." 
  Hamas claimed a former collaborator worked with militants to 
ambush and kill a member of the Shin Bet internal intelligence 
service and wound two others on the West Bank on Sunday. 
  Last November the fundamentalists, who have taken up arms to 
drive out Jews, announced that Palestinians who collaborate with 
the Israelis had two months to repent. 
  After the deadline the almost daily murders of alleged 
collaborators resumed in the occupied territories. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam said on Tuesday that the fasting month 
of Ramadan now underway would be marked by the murder of 
Israelis to avenge fallen Palestinian militants. 
  Thirteen Palestinians have been killed for suspected 
collaboration with Israel since the start of this month alone, 
and Hamas has claimed responsibility for most of them. 
  According to the army, about 1,000 Palestinians -- including 
many drug dealers, addicts, prostitutes and personal vendetta 
victims -- have been killed by fellow Palestinians since the 
intifadah or uprising began in December 1987.

  [Text] The existence of a terrorism academy in Burj 
al-Barajinah [south Beirut] was revealed yesterday. Judge Nasri 
Lahhud, the government's representative at the Military 
Tribunal, has indicted the Palestinian Ghalib Husayn al-Jamal, 
currently in custody, on the charge of training individuals to 
carry out terrorist operations and manufacture the necessary 
explosives for such activity. Al-Jamal opened a school in Burj 
al-Barajinah, calling it the Academy of Terrorist Operations. 
He charged $50 for each lesson. 
  Judge Lahhud also indicted al-Jamal's brother-in-law, Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi, currently at large, for supplying al-Jamal with 
terrorist trainees over a period of four months. He referred 
the case to the military prosecutor.

<F P=106> [Guido Olimpio report: "Al-Qadhdhafi `Enrolls' Abu-Nidal </F>
and Plans Attacks"] 
  [Text] Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is returning to his old love: 
terrorism. Under pressure from the Western governments and 
squeezed by the UN conditions over the Lockerbie affair, the 
Libyan colonel has decided to resume contacts with his former 
allies. Lebanese sources revealed to CORRIERE that at the end 
of December the leader had a lengthy "working" meeting with the 
elusive Abu-Nidal, the Palestinian extremist sentenced to death 
by the PLO and wanted by police forces all over the world. 
  During the meeting, which took place amid strict security 
measures, al-Qadhdhafi informed Abu-Nidal of his intention to 
revive the international terrorist organization that was behind 
bloodthirsty attacks in the eighties. 
  The Libyan leader promised that, apart from the usual 
sources 
of funding, Abu-Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council will receive 
a $50,000 check for a series of actions designed to halt the 
peace process. Furthermore, Libya will reopen its training 
camps to the extremist's terrorists. 
  According to the same sources, very substantial aid has been 
allocated to other Middle Eastern groups. In particular, Ahmad 
Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command has received orders to organize attacks. Jibril himself 
discussed strategy and objectives with al-Qadhdhafi. 
  With his coffers full and with the protection of the Libyan 
secret services, Abu-Nidal set to work at once. On 25 November 
-- though this was not reported until the following month -- the 
Venezuelan police thwarted a plan to blow up the Israeli Embassy 
in Caracas. The brains behind the operation was a Palestinian, 
formerly resident in Colombia, known as Yusuf Salah [name as 
received]. Just a few days ago in Beirut a Jordanian diplomat 
was killed by a hit man who was subsequently arrested together 
with a number of accomplices. According to the Lebanese police, 
the cell belongs to Abu-Nidal's gang. 
  The most disturbing aspect of this revived cooperation is 
the 
fact that al-Qadhdhafi does not even try to conceal his "bad 
company." In a speech delivered 16 December the colonel said 
that Libya will be the "Mecca" of guerrilla fighters from 
Northern Ireland to the Philippines. At a mass rally a few days 
earlier he urged the leaders of the fiercest terrorist groups to 
return to Libya.

<F P=106> [Amir Taheri report: "Rabeh Kebir Criticizes Khartoum Move; </F>
France Turns Down Sudanese Offer To Mediate With Algerian 
Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] London -- High-ranking French sources confirmed 
yesterday that the French Government had turned down a Sudanese 
offer for Sudanese circles to play the role of "honest broker" 
between the Algerian Government and the [Islamic] Salvation 
Front [FIS]. [see item PM1002162494 in Near East Regional 
Affairs section of previous Terrorism Report] 
  However, contacts between Sudanese authorities and Israel 
over Khartoum's mediation with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the 
occupied territories have continued in Europe and the United 
States. 
  The Sudanese move took place in December when "mutual 
friends" conveyed a message from Khartoum to Paris. The 
Sudanese message said that an alliance between "the Armed Forces 
and Islamists along the lines of the Sudanese model" could solve 
the Algerian problem. A senior Sudanese intelligence officer 
visited Paris twice in January and met with Defense Ministry 
officials. 
  The French sources confirmed that a meeting was held between 
Colonel Jean-Claude Mantione [as transliterated], expert in 
black African affairs, and the Sudanese general. However, the 
sources said that the meeting did not broach the situation in 
Algeria. Instead, the two men discussed the regional dispute 
between Central Africa and Sudan. There are reports that Bangui 
is planning to occupy a strip of Sudanese territory which it 
claims belongs to it. 
  First reports about the secret contacts between Paris and 
Khartoum emerged last month. The news provoked opposition and 
criticism from Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo. They met 
with the French ambassador in Cairo. He denied the report, 
describing them as baseless. 
  Khartoum has for some time persisted in presenting itself to 
the West as a mediator with fundamentalist forces in Africa and 
the Middle East. And Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of 
the National Islamic Front in Sudan, expressed his support for 
the agreement between the PLO and Israel. He also criticized 
Algerian FIS leader Abassi Madani for not taking account of 
France's opinion during the general elections two years ago. 
  FIS leaders in exile have rejected Khartoum's move vis-a-vis 
Algeria. In a press interview yesterday Rabeh Kebir said that 
he had heard about these contacts from the media only. He said 
"if that is true, it is regrettable, because it represents a 
biased move in favor of the military group in Algeria." 
  Contacts with Israel began in Geneva last year when two 
Sudanese envoys met with a Swiss businessman close to Tel Aviv. 
  Western intelligence sources say that Khartoum offered to 
help win over the support of the Palestinian rejectionist 
movements, especially Hamas, opposed to the agreement between 
the PLO and Israel. In return, Khartoum wanted Israel to help 
to open the channel of dialogue with Washington. 
  In December Hasan al-Turabi persuaded the Islamic Conference 
in Khartoum not to adopt hard-line positions against the West 
and Israel. 
  Khartoum's attempt to move closer to Paris is attributable 
to 
the Sudanese belief that France is seeking to open a dialogue 
with some of the "isolated regimes," including Iran and Iraq. 
  But the French sources said that "no one wants to buy what 
Sudan is offering." Khartoum's recent initiatives have led to a 
state of coolness in relations with Tehran. Late last year 
Iranian media services described al-Turabi's attempt to mediate 
in Afghanistan as "suspicious." Tehran turned down al-Turabi's 
request to visit it to discuss Afghanistan, so the mediation 
failed before it began. Western analysts say that recent 
Sudanese moves are linked with the deterioration of economic 
conditions and the Sudanese leadership's hopes of neutralizing 
the West while the Sudanese Army prepares to launch large-scale 
new military operations in the south.

  [Text] The president of the republic, Lieutenant General 
'Umar al-Bashir, has confirmed the revolution's adherence to the 
cultural course accepted by the Sudanese people of making God's 
law their arbiter. He said that the dogfight of the enemies and 
those lying in wait for us would only make us more determined to 
move forward to establish a good society, a society of values 
and decent morals. 
  Lieutenant General al-Bashir made it clear in his speech 
before the masses during the holding of God's table [ma'idat 
al-rahman ayt -- breaking the fast for the poor] at Umm Baddah 
that the conspiracy of the West will not frighten us, because we 
know that power belongs to God alone. The shortage of funds, 
men and fruits [Koranic quote] to which we have been subjected 
is no more than a trial from God to test the extent of our 
adherence to his course and the extent of our turning towards 
him. 
  He stated: We once again declare our rejection of all 
resolutions and charters of the security council and the United 
Nations which contradict God's law.

<F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>
  [Text] Kosti, Sudan--The "Brothers" [al-Ashiqqa'] page has 
exclusively obtained the text of the speech delivered by Ibrahim 
al-Sanusi, one of the leaders of the military wing of the 
[National] Islamic Front [NIF], to the popular defense 
battalions in Kosti, a town on the White Nile. In his address 
to these forces, al-Sanusi unleashed a scathing attack on the 
so-called global arrogant forces and their Arab and African 
satellites. 
  One of the Islamic Front militia recruits asked whether the 
Islamic regime can stand fast to the end in the face of the 
blockade and its harmful effects on society. The recruit said 
society is not yet sufficiently conditioned culturally to 
prevent an all-out popular rebellion, which the opposition 
forces might exploit to overthrow the regime. Ibrahim al-Sanusi 
answered: We know very well the strength of the Sudanese 
opposition and the limits of its strength. In the first days of 
the "revolution," we offered them samples of the "Islamic" 
state's methods of dealing with the opponents of the Islamic 
regime. We hit them hard while we were strong! We then opened 
the borders to them. They left and became isolated from the 
society that we are now restructuring according to our Islamic 
concept. We have not failed in this objective. But we are 
surprised by a "handful of agents" who are hitting us inside our 
borders through various forms of conspiracy that threaten to 
open the door wide to apostasy!! 
  Al-Sanusi added: If the worst happens, as the brother who 
asked the question warned, it will come as no surprise to us. 
We have prepared ourselves and have the ability to fire in all 
arenas. If the signs of this apostasy begin to appear on our 
land, they must consider their ambassadors and nationals as our 
"hostages" while we consider that all our brothers residing in 
their countries are offering sacrifices to God. These brothers 
know they were born for this purpose, that is, either to be 
God's servants or strugglers. 
  This speech, which was printed and distributed by the 
culture 
and information branch of the People's Defense command, has 
provoked sharp controversy and a crisis between the security 
departments and the military intelligence department over 
whether this speech should be withdrawn and the videotape 
destroyed. The political command was asked to intervene to 
implement the decision. Minister of Presidential Affairs Ghazi 
Salah-al-Din intervened and insisted on keeping this speech in 
the archives of al-Jihad, belittling the possibility of foreign 
reaction in the event that it is leaked out. In a telephone 
conversation with the director of military intelligence, 
Salah-al-Din said: Let them withdraw their nationals and 
ambassadors. Have they left any relations requiring the 
presence of these ambassadors and nationals?

  [Excerpt] Algiers, 14 Feb (MENA)--Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, 
former Sudanese prime minister and opposition leader, has 
accused the Sudanese Government of responsibility for the [4 
February] armed attack against a mosque in Khartoum. He said 
the government has facilitated the entry of extremists from 
various countries of the world into Sudan. Addressing the Ansar 
al-Sunnah group, whose mosque was attacked last week, al-Mahdi 
said that the government has opened the country's doors to 
extremists who only believe in violence and reject any dialogue 
to resolve differences. 
  In statements published by the Algerian French-language 
paper 
EL WATAN today, al-Mahdi added that this incident, which left 16 
people dead, is regarded as the most serious in Sudan since the 
military coup carried out by 'Umar al-Bashir in 1989. 
  He noted that Sudan has become a place of refuge for all the 
extremists from the various countries of the world, including 
the Egyptian Islamic groups, the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda 
Movement, the Moroccan al-'Adl wa al-Ihsan Group, and the 
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, as well as leader of the 
Sudanese Islamic Front Hasan al-Turabi. 
  The Algerian EL WATAN said that 50 leaders of these groups 
will form a council that will meet regularly in Sudan. There is 
already a smaller council consisting of 15 top leaders, 
including Algerian FIS leaders Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. 
The paper noted that after their arrest, Rached Ghannouchi, 
leader of the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda Movement, has become the 
most important figure in this council. 
  The paper wondered whether the extremists admitted into the 
country by the Sudanese government were behind the armed attack 
that took place against the mosque of the Ansar al-Sunnah group, 
which is opposed to the government and is being persecuted by 
the Sudanese authorities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 12 (AFP)--Three French tourists held 
hostage since January 23 in north Yemen arrived here Saturday 
after being freed by their captors, French diplomats said. [see 
SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in front of this Terrorism Report for 
footage of interviews with released hostages] 
  Henri Heslot and his wife, Jeanne, both aged 72 and retired 
agriculture professors, as well as cardiologist Brigitte 
Fontaine, 42, arrived in a Yemeni Army helicopter from the 
village of Al-Madhan where they were held by Ahnum tribesmen 
trying to force the government to build a road through their 
region. 
  "France is very happy they have been released and thanks the 
Yemeni authorities as well as the elders who personally 
intervened to help free them," said a French Foreign Ministry 
spokesman in Paris. 
  He said the three who were in good health had been received 
by the French ambassador to Yemen, Marcel Laugel, were to return 
Sunday to France on a regular flight. 
  Earlier, Yemeni Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil told 
AFP the kidnappers had released the three tourists in the north 
of the country. 
  The French tourists were accompanied by a delegation of 
negotiators sent earlier in the week by the government to secure 
their release. 
  The three had been detained near the village of Al-Madhan, 
200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of the capital. They had 
been abducted in Hajjah province while on a tour organized by 
Club Aventure (Adventure Club), the company's director in Paris 
had said. 
  On February 1, reliable Yemeni sources said the authorities 
had told the captors in a letter they would look into demands 
for a road into the tribesmen's remote mountain fief. 
  The powerful Hashid tribes, whose land surrounds the Ahnum, 
had altered the direction of the contested road. 
  The Ahnum were demanding that a road be built to bypass 
Hashid land, so that their goods could be delivered to other 
parts of the country safely. 
  Last month the English-language YEMEN TIMES reported that 
the 
ministry of public works had come under strong pressure from the 
Hashid tribal chief, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, who is the 
parliamentary speaker, to re-route the road so as to skirt the 
Ahnum enclave. 
  Hashid tribesmen had cut off supplies to the remote mountain 
village in northwestern Yemen where the French tourists were 
held to force the kidnappers' surrender. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih recently warned kidnappers in 
Yemen they would not escape unpunished following the detention 
of the French tourists. 
  Mutawakkil said the release of the three hostages was thanks 
to mediation efforts, notably by chiefs of the Bakil tribal 
group of which the Ahnum are members. 
  Tribes frequently kidnap foreigners, particularly western 
oil 
workers, as leverage in dealing with the government.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Feb 15 (AFP)--Three kidnapped Chinese 
engineers are in the hands of wanted murderers who are demanding 
that the authorities drop death sentences against them, a 
Chinese Embassy official said here Tuesday. 
  "To free the Chinese, the three Yemeni kidnappers want the 
government to cancel death sentences pronounced against them in 
absentia," early in January, second secretary at the embassy Luo 
Xiao Guang [as received] told AFP. 
  The kidnappers are wanted for several murders, Yemeni 
sources 
said Monday. 
  "No progress was made by the authorities in their talks with 
the kidnappers," he said. 
  One of the hostages is chief engineer Yanj Yi [as received], 
55, according to the diplomat, who did not name the two others. 
  The hostages are held by members of the Khawlan tribe in 
Hajana region, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Sanaa, he added. 
  To win their release, the embassy is in contact with the 
Ministries of Interior and Planning, and with influential 
Khalwan tribesmen as well, he said. 
  The engineers were kidnapped Saturday while working on a 
road 
project financed by China to link Hajana and Ma'rib, 173 
kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, in the rugged and 
tribal northeast. 
  The kidnappers also said they wanted the road construction 
to 
stop but they did not explain why, the Chinese diplomat said. 
Almost one-third of the road has already been built, he added.

  [Text] Yerevan, Feb 11 (SNARK)--Tonight the trunk gas 
pipeline entering Armenia has been blown up again. The Armenian 
government's press-service told SNARK the explosion took place 
in the Marneuli region of Georgia, mainly inhabited by 
Azerbaijanis. The Armenian specialists have already left for the 
accident's place. 
  Meanwhile, it is reported that a day before the explosion 
the 
Georgian government had blocked the gas entrance to Armenia, 
motivating it by a scanty amount of gas entering Georgia. 
During the last two years about 15 sabotage acts were committed 
on this pipeline. Despite numerous appeals of Armenian 
officials, the Georgian government doesn't provide with the safe 
guarding of the pipeline.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Chairman Vakhtang </F>
Dzabiradze and Popular Front Chairman Nodar Natadze by Lili 
Burbutashvili on 8 February; place not given: "Terrorist Acts 
as Viewed by Parliamentarians"] 
  [Text] [Dzabiradze] One can say that the latest fact, I 
mean the explosion that killed [Deputy Defense Minister Niko] 
Kekelidze [on 3 February; see item LD0802115694 in previous 
Terrorism Report], shows that a new era has begun in the country 
-- that of terrorism. Prominent figures belonging to armed 
formations are, to all intents and purposes, being wiped out 
gradually and almost in a systematic manner. The hallmarks are 
identical in almost every case. Unfortunately, the law 
enforcement bodies have not uncovered a single fact concerning 
this terrorism. Who could be responsible for this? Nothing can 
be excluded in our troubled times. The point is that countless 
armed groups are active in the country. The general public 
knows that relations between these groups are far from good and, 
on this basis, we could be dealing with clashes between mafia 
clans or a "mafia war" similar to that in the United States in 
the 1930's. The reason lies in the redistribution of spheres 
and lines of action. As a result of the existing unstable 
political factor in the country, it is quite possible that 
certain political forces are also interested in the "removal" of 
some of these people. There is also another element -- external 
forces that, today, are not creating or are unable to create new 
hot spots in Georgia (life is, to a certain extent, following 
its course) and this method gives them the means to preserve a 
certain measure of instability and create an atmosphere of fear 
among the population. It is known that recent terrorist acts 
have resulted in the deaths of innocent people. Therefore, such 
a serious situation in the country enables both external and 
internal political forces to destroy physically their main 
political rivals. Unfortunately, one can expect the further 
development of events in this direction: It is much easier 
today to get rid of a political rival with a bomb than have him 
arrested. So, if the authorities are unable to dispel these 
suspicions, they should at least aim to unmask the perpetrators 
of these terrorist acts in order to restore order. Otherwise, 
we will have every reason to believe that the current 
authorities are creating the serious situation prevailing in 
Georgia. 
  [Natadze] I have specific information (about one month now) 
that Russia is planning to occupy Georgia within six months 
using several divisions. The first stage: One and a half 
months will be needed to disarm bands and also, against this 
background, all those left [in possession of weapons] or, in 
other words, the physical removal of weapons from Georgia. The 
next month and a half will be needed for the production of 
meager "calories" (loans, supplies) and the final three months 
will be needed for the creation of its own power structures 
(troops to guard the railways...). As I knew, in order to 
embark upon this operation, Russia needed an "invitation"; if 
not from parliament (naturally, they would not be able to get it 
from parliament) and if not from the head of state (the head of 
state would never take such a direct step), at any rate, from 
some kind of elite group of 200-300 persons. The so-called 
proletariat is no longer suitable for such a thing as it was in 
1921. That needed a clever elite. They have been unable to 
muster such a group, not because there are not 200-300 
unscrupulous people in Georgia, but because this potential group 
of unscrupulous people has the ability to make minor forecasts. 
They know what to expect by taking such a step. As can be 
seen, they [Russia] have abandoned such a move and have started 
to take direct action. I think that what is happening is state 
terrorism; only, the state concerned is not Georgia but a 
neighboring one that has countless agents in Georgia. Your 
newspaper has dealt with this issue in Irakli Batiashvili's 
[former head of the Information and Intelligence Service] 
article [in the issue of 8 February].

  [Text] Ajaccio, Corsica, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The banned 
Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) announced early 
Thursday that it was resuming its military activities after an 
eight-month truce. 
  At a clandestine press conference held at a remote spot in 
southern Corsica, an FLNC spokesman flanked by about 100 
heavily-armed and hooded militants, announced the end of the 
truce declared on June 22 last year. 
  Most of the FLNC leadership was present, seated at a table 
beneath a banner reading "FLNC: The people has risen up. It 
must go forward." 
  The Corsican nationalist movement said its decision to 
resume 
its military activities "reflects our determination not to be 
fobbed off with dud promises or satisfied with a few concessions 
involving institutional gadgets or a heap of cash." 
  The FLNC said a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on 
February 1 had "dissipated any ambiguity" about government 
policy. It said government policy in Corsica was "stamped with 
the seal of colonialism." 
  In view of the government's "intransigence" the FLNC said 
"we 
will resume our fight at all levels."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with the new Federal Public Prosecutor Kay </F>
Nehm by Peter Ellgaard in Mainz on 13 February; announced as 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ellgaard] You seem to have 
years of experience with right-wing extremism. What are the 
reasons? It is striking that the incidence of right-wing 
extremist violence have increased since reunification. 
  [Nehm] When I first went to eastern Germany to monitor the 
public prosecutor there to see what tasks we might be facing, I 
realized that there was an enormous potential of aggression in 
the streets. I told the authorities, saying that we might have 
to deal with something we had not known up to then; and 
unfortunately this has become true. 
  [Ellgaard] But bans do not seem to elicit the desired 
results, as we have just heard. What must be done to fight 
right-wing extremism more efficiently? 
  [Nehm] Bans always have the disadvantage that the structures 
of those banned are then no longer discernible. The great 
advantage of openly fighting this form of violence is that the 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution can get an insight 
into the structures, can more easily infiltrate them to see what 
goes on.[passage omitted] 
  [Ellgaard] Are you prepared for possible attacks against 
this state from the right-wing extremist scene, in the manner of 
the leftist RAF [Red Army Faction]? 
  [Nehm] There have always been attacks. The difference was 
that they have not always been directed, in the sense of a 
particular attitude. With the RAF, the objects were always 
representatives of the state, industry, etc.. With right-wing 
violence, it has been violence as such, in order to get 
attention. Whether this might take other forms, I do not know. 
But let me come back to our responsibility. If right-wing 
violence takes forms similar to those of the RAF, we will pursue 
these things with the same consistency. 
  [Ellgaard] What are your possibilities of becoming active 
across borders? After all, there is an international network on 
this scene now. 
  [Nehm] There has always been such a network. Just remember 
the stickers that came over from America in the 70's. We have 
always had to keep an eye on what spills over to the Federal 
Republic. In Belgium, in all the countries around us, this 
phenomenon can be observed. What is particularly alarming for 
us is that we experienced the past of the Third Reich with 
organized extermination of minorities and other nations, murder 
organized by the government; and I think we have every reason to 
be averse to this. And this is the disgraceful thing about 
these pictures, that people do not seem to have learned a thing 
from the past. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed AH/SN/UC: "Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the </F>
El-Al Bombing at Zurich-Kloten. Airport Police equipped with 
High Technology"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern 15 Feb (ATS) -- After the 1969 Palestinian 
bombing, the police force at Zurich-Kloten airport has undergone 
quite some changes. Insignificant until then, it has turned 
into an 800-strong security force outfitted with 
state-of-the-art equipment. Two new projects will be carried 
out in the near future, namely the upgrading of the airport's 
enclosure and cargo installation. 
  Immediately after the bombing of the Israeli aircraft, a 
decision was made to separately control planes coming from and 
going to the Middle East. These are under permanent 
surveillance, airport police chief Ulrich Neeracher told ATS 
[Agence Telegraphique Suisse]. Mail is now controlled using 
X-ray devices. From the Fall of 1969, Swiss Army troops began 
guarding the airport; they remained in place for a year before 
being relieved by the Zurich canton police. 
  After a bomb explosion in the luggage compartment of a 
Swissair aircraft in February 1970, leading to its crash in 
Wuerenlingen, luggage control was introduced, as well as 
controls of Israel-bound freight. Since the hijacking of a 
Swissair plane to Jordan in Fall 1970, specially trained 
security agents accompany long-distance flights. 
<H5>  Maximum Emergency </H5>
  Today, Zurich-Kloten's airport police uses state-of-the-art 
monitoring techniques: bomb detectors, or bicolor X-ray 
machines. Security measures are reinforced depending on the 
needs. The last maximum security alert was installed during the 
Gulf War, in early 1991. 
  In 1990, policemen managed to avert an attack against an 
Israeli El-Al plane, when they discovered a bomb inside a 
suitcase.

<F P=106> [Part one of a three-part interview with Abdullah Ocalan, </F>
leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, by Huseyin Gul; place 
and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] KURD-A/Botan--[passage omitted] [Gul] I want to 
ask a question that interests everybody. What is your 
assessment of the murder of Mehmet Nabi Inciler and Behcet 
Canturk, who were Kurds known as godfathers in Turkey? 
  [Ocalan] We could easily state that starting with the murder 
of DEP [Democracy Party] parliamentarian Mehmet Sincar, these 
murders of those we could describe as patriotic Kurdish 
businessmen were done under the direct orders from the highest 
authority. Nabi Inciler, nicknamed "Inci Baba," and Behcet 
Canturk were disposed of because of the role they could have 
played in the Kurdish problem, as they had done in the past. 
  These are intimidation murders aimed at silencing this 
[patriotic] segment and at encouraging the emergence of a 
collaborationist segment, such as volunteer village guards, some 
clan leaders drawn to Ankara, and many such agents. 
  [Gul] The 27 March local elections are approaching. It is 
expected that the state will conduct large-scale detentions on 
the eve of the elections. What will be your stance on the 
elections? 
  [Ocalan] The state is engaged in an "all or nothing" game. 
It is trying to hold the elections on the principle of the 
complete destruction of our movement. It is trying to 
completely disregard the legal foundations. It is trying to 
reverse a possible referendum situation in Kurdistan. It 
appears that the state will intensify its activities in this 
direction. 
  [Gul] What is your assessment of the attack on Zhalah camp 
and the position of the southern forces [Iraqi Kurdish parties] 
on this attack? 
  [Ocalan] The Zhalah operation was designed to use the 
federal 
government in the south against us or, failing this, to warn 
that government that Turkey could bomb it out. With the Zhalah 
operation, the Turkish state is also indicating its "political 
decisiveness" to resort to bombings if its policy toward the PKK 
fails. They are resorting to military, political, and 
diplomatic initiatives. They already did all that was possible 
in the diplomatic arena. All these initiatives are various 
aspects of their policy, and indications are that they will 
further escalate their violence by the spring. 
  The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we must 
look at the situation from a wider perspective, assign duties, 
and prepare our guerrilla force, war effort, introduction of new 
ideas, enhancement of efforts, and cognizance of defects and 
assessment of advantages accordingly. 
  It is imperative that we make preparations quickly and move 
toward implementation. Time is vital for us, too. It is 
possible to pack the efforts of the past years into these few 
months. It is possible to achieve as much within the coming 
months as was achieved during the previous years. At such 
fast-moving historic times, it is easy to make maximum gains in 
a lifetime if a proper response is made.

  [Text] Many enemy soldiers were killed or injured as a 
result of the operation carried out by our guerrilla armed units 
between Cudi-(Heydar) region [words indistinct] on 8 February. 
  According to information obtained from [words indistinct], 
the colonialist enemy units laid mines on Cudi-Heydar road. A 
tractor belonging to patriots hit one of these mines as a result 
of which the tractor was damaged and one patriot was injured. 
  [Words indistinct] one of our patriots threw a grenade on a 
police armored car in Cizre. Upon which, the enemy forces 
opened howitzer fire on Cizre. According to reports, many 
workshops were damaged. [words indistinct] 
  Situation in Mardin Province: [Passage indistinct] the 
police building was partially burned and counterguerrilla 
headquarters was completely burned following a raid by our

  According to information obtained from guerrilla sources, 
[words indistinct]. The colonialist enemy forces surrounded 
Nusaybin [words indistinct] on 7 February. A clash ensued 
between our guerrillas and the enemy forces [words indistinct]. 
Nine soldiers in an enemy jeep were destroyed. This was

[passage indistinct]. 
  [Passage indistinct] the enemy operations are continuing 
against Bismil. It is being reported that many patriots have 
been detained and thus far there has been no information about 
their fate. 
  The enemy distributed pamphlets in [place-name indistinct] 
and tried to instigate our patriotic people to organize a march 
against the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]. However, the people 
did not heed their suggestion and turned its back to groups of 
marchers made up of children and (?Turks). Upon this, the 
fascist marchers (?canceled) their marches. Thus, the enemy's 
initiative in this direction came to naught. 
  The colonialist regime's efforts to organize marches in 
various provinces and districts against our party have so far 
given no results, and have failed. The fascist enemy army 
closed down [words indistinct] and is making detentions. 
  It was learned that the colonialist enemy has committed 
tortures in the villages of Igdir and [place name indistinct]. 
Even women are being subjected to such tortures. Our radio was

  [Excerpts] Baku (February 11) TURAN -- According to some 
Western sources, the leader of the Kurdish Working Party (KWP) 
[Kurdish Workers Party -- PKK], Abdullah Ocalan is presently in 
Armenia. [passage omitted] 
  In late December 1993, the personal representative of 
Abdullah Ocalan, Zahir Bardani, met with political leaders of 
Armenia in Echmiadzin. The representative of Armenians of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Levon Melik-Shakhnazarov attended the meeting 
as well. As a result of the meeting, the KWP headquarters was 
partially moved to Armenia and 660 Kurdish soldiers appeared in 
Armenian units fighting against Azerbaijan. 
  But cooperation of Armenians and Kurds began long before the 
meeting in Echmiadzin. Since 1988, Kurdish soldiers have been 
training together with Armenian terrorists from "ASALA" 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in Cyprus. 
Soon, Abdullah Ocalan gave $1.2 million to build an additional 
base for the training of Armenian and Kurdish soldiers. 
  Earlier, Western journalists having visited Armenian regions 
neighbouring Turkey, reported that there were 21 bases training 
Kurdish soldiers. According to the same sources, the Kurds have 
been conducting subversive acts in Turkey from those bases.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, Feb 12 (AFP) -- [passage omitted] In 
Istanbul, the military wing of the PKK claimed responsibility 
for a bomb explosion Saturday morning in Tuzla, 60 kilometres 
(38 miles) east of the city, which killed five people and 
wounded at least 30, according to the latest toll. 
  All of the dead or wounded were army officer cadets. The 
home-made bomb, hidden in a rubbish bin at a railway station, 
went off shortly after they were let out for the weekend. 
  A press statement released later by the pro-Kurdish agency 
Kurd-[H]a said the bombing was carried out by an "underground 
revenge group" of the Popular Army for the Liberation of 
Kurdistan. 
  Some 60 people have been killed this month alone in 
separatist skirmishes in the east and southeast of the country, 
according to an AFP tally based on official reports. There has 
been a total of 11,000 deaths, including 3,300 civilians, since 
the start of the Kurdish rebellion in 1984.

  [Excerpt] Ankara--Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay said that 
the number of criminals arrested and imprisoned for terrorist 
activities had reached 6,500, and predicted that it would reach 
10,000 very soon. 
  Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition 
government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now, 
according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff, 
22 terrorists were being arrested every day. 
  Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state 
penitentiary would be moved to another prison. 
  He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions 
in Turkish prisons. 
  He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in 
the province where they were sentenced, the government should 
increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas where terrorism

<F P=106> [Article by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey will enter into an important 
phase in March. The important period that begins with the 
Ramadan Feast of the Muslims, will continue with the Newroz 
Feast of the Kurds and will finally end with the March 27 local 
elections which will effect both the Kurds and the Turks. These 
three important events will take place within one week of each 
other. The widespread belief held by the public is that the 
local elections will not be held in a completely safe 
environment. There are reports already which predict that both 
the state and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) will 
exert pressure on each other during the elections. The first 
example of such pressure was experienced in Cizre. Cizre is a 
district that is mostly influenced by the PKK and for this 
reason the state is attaching special importance to this 
district and taking similar measures in other settlements. The 
most obvious element of such measures is that suburbs are being 
evacuated and village guards are being settled there. The 
communities which are forced out of their settlements during 
these operations are also missing out on their opportunity to 
vote. It is reported that about 1.5 million people in southern 
and southeastern Anatolia are being forced to migrate. 
  The excitement and the tension of the March 27 local 
elections have already begun. In the western part of the 
country, almost all parties' candidates are being announced and 
election campaigns have started. However, there is nobody in 
southern and southeastern Anatolia who has announced his or her 
candidature for the mayoral elections as yet. With the 
exception of one or two, almost every candidate's name is being 
kept secret. Following the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party's 
boycott, the political parties are keeping the names of their 
candidates secret for security reasons. The pro-Kurdish 
Democracy Party (DEP) is also reluctant to announce its 
candidates for fear of reprisals. 
  The other common element among the parties is that they all 
feel that the March elections will not be held in a safe 
environment. The source of this suspicion is the prediction that 
both the government and the PKK will apply pressure on each 
other during the elections. 
  It is necessary to point out though that the communities 
living in this region do not want such pressure or election 
rigging. Both seem impossible to avoid. For one thing, the 
government is afraid that the PKK will support the Democracy 
Party's mayoral candidates and use the election as a referendum 
to bring them onto the international political platform to argue 
for the Kurdish cause. 
  The other worry is that the PKK will argue that the election 
results are invalid because of the pressure the government has 
exerted on the candidates of the Democracy Party and will again 
try to use this as ammunition against Turkey at the 
international level and boycott the election results. Everybody 
in the region is curious about the PKK's attitude toward the 
local elections. The PKK has not expressed any opinions about 
the elections as yet. There are reports that it will make a 
statement on February 15 about the local elections. It is 
feared that if the PKK calls for non-participation in the local 
elections, there will be a reduction in the number of votes in 
the region and the PKK will use this as a referendum to argue 
its case. 
  This has proven to be the least favored option so far. DEP 
leader Hatip Dicle's remark: "We may reach an historic decision 
and not take part in the elections" is one element that adds 
weight to this theory. One other possible outcome is that the 
PKK regards the results of an election which it has boycotted to 
be to its advantage. In short, the PKK will try in any case to 
use the election results as its referendum. Almost everybody 
seems to agree that the results of the local elections will be 
in the PKK's favor. The PKK is aiming to win at least 200 local 
government posts in the Southeast. As the PKK makes these 
calculations, the government is making preparations to ensure 
that the elections take place. 
  As a result of amendments made earlier, members of the Armed 
Forces will be able to vote at the local elections with their 
weapons in their hands. Certain sections of the community are 
critical of this decision, saying the shadow of weapons will be 
on the ballot boxes, but the government authorities say that 
this measure is necessary for security reasons. As a 
precautionary measure, the authorities say, the ballot boxes 
will be taken by helicopter to a safe place for counting. 
Recent newspaper reports say that some 150,000 additional 
soldiers have been sent to the region in preparation for the 
elections. Observers point out what the PKK will do is not 
certain, but suspect that it will attack polling booths at which 
the armed forces will cast their votes in order to ensure that 
the government does not have the chance to change the election 
results. One fact is that the PKK has forbidden all political 
parties from taking part in the elections. All parties except 
the Welfare Party (RP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) 
have obeyed this order. For this reason parties are having 
difficulty in finding and endorsing mayoral candidates in the 
region as the candidates will be the first targets. 
<H5>  Cizre Is a Battlefield </H5>
  As the date for the local elections draws closer, the 
fighting in Cizre, a district of Sirnak province, between the 
security forces and the PKK militants intensifies. As armed 
conflicts are taking place almost everyday, the inhabitants of 
the region are being forced to flee. 
  There are reports which claim that up to 2,000 families have 
left the district as a result of pressure from the security 
forces. Some are going back to the villages they came from 
while others are going to Adana, Mardin, Iskenderun and 
Istanbul. Also among the reports is the claim that village 
guards are being settled in the dwellings vacated by the 
villagers. The government wants the chief village guard and RP 
candidate Kamil Atak to be elected as the mayor for Cizre. 
  The other issue is that those villagers who leave their 
villages will be unable to vote because they are not on the 
voting registers of the cities they move to. One other 
interesting thing is that the village guards who move into the 
empty houses will not be able to vote either. It would not be 
an exaggeration to say though that village guards who are not on 
the electoral roll will be made to vote. This would be regarded 
as an act of interference in the election process by the 
authorities. 
  The reason for the security forces labelling Cizre as a 
special zone is that Cizre is one of the districts in which the 
PKK is very effective. The number of people living in the 
surrounding villages, Cizre and the Sirnak province is said to 
be around 100,000 (including the ones who have moved out) even 
though the population in the area has decreased in the past 
one-and-a-half months due to the large numbers of people leaving 
the area. The fact that village guards are assisting the 
security forces in exerting pressure on the villages means that 
there is a contradiction. The village guards can only be active 
in villages in accordance with the laws in place but they are 
now becoming active in towns and cities as can be seen from 
their activities in Cizre. 
  According to reports received from Cizre and its environs, 
the village guards are able to question people following the 
operations they carry out in cooperation with the security 
forces. It is claimed that some of these people who are 
detained have also been killed, at least 15 of them by the 
village guards. Eyewitnesses say that a villager named Ahmet 
Kutle was assassinated by the village guards in the command of 
Kamil Atak in front of the Kerem Hotel. 
<H5>  Events Experienced in Cizre Day by Day </H5>
  In January, security forces put up posters in Cizre which 
read: "Young man, you may have joined an organization or 
committed crimes either voluntarily or by force. Society and 
the state believes that one may make a mistake and also believe 
in the necessity of pardoning those who repent. In order to 
benefit from this opportunity, turn yourself into the nearest 
security office." Another poster read, "Flags depicting the 
hammer and sickle are the symbol of communism. The PKK's real 
flag is the red flag with the hammer and sickle which the PKK is 
hiding from the people. The PKK's main target is to establish a 
communist order." 
  The tension which began with the hanging of these posters 
has 
reached its peak with the operations carried out of January 22 
in Sur, Dagkapi, Alibey, Dicle and Meydanbasi neighborhoods 
where nearly 500 people were taken into custody. Those who were 
taken into custody were reportedly ordered to stand and hold 
their hands on top of their heads for three hours. Meanwhile, 
the town's telephone connections were cut off as well. 
  During the night after the day when operations were carried 
out in the neighborhoods, PKK militants conducted a raid on the 
quarters of the Security Directorate. It was claimed that four 
policemen were killed in the raid. The Office of the Emergency 
Rule Governor announced that one PKK militant and a policeman 
were killed and four other policemen were wounded in the attack. 
Following the raid, security forces were alleged to have combed 
the town at random and one child was allegedly wounded in the 
operation. 
  The tension continued in the following days. On January 27, 
village guards and security forces staged a march. After police 
had instructed tradesmen in Cizre to hang Turkish flags on their 
shops otherwise they would be asked to pay a TL [Turkish lira] 
500,000 fine, there was a protest march against the PKK. The 
number of marchers rose to 600 with the participation of the 
village guards affiliated to Kamil Atak. It was claimed that 
certain village guards looted some shops during the march. 
  On January 28, the Nur neighborhood was raided by the 
security forces and the village guards. 
  On January 30, the body of Ibrahim Danis (19), who was 
alleged to have been taken into custody during the operation in 
Kurtulus neighborhood on January 27, was found. Danis's body 
was alleged to have been put in a house which belonged to a 
village guard and the house was claimed to have been bombed 
later. 
  Persons above the age of 10 have started being taken into 
custody. While it is claimed that people who are taken into 
custody are tortured and forced to abandon the town, seven of 
those who were taken in custody were killed and no information 
about 15 others could be obtained. The names of the people who 
are claimed to have been killed after being taken in custody are 
as follows: 
  Ibrahim Danis, Resit Pusal, Selim Ebubekir Duran, Ahmet 
Yusuf 
Tun and his son Isa Tun, and Selim and Ahmet whose last names 
cannot be determined. 
  A total of nine people, two of whom are children, have lost 
their lives since the intensive clashes broke out. 
  People have become accustomed to the clashes which are 
experienced almost every day. The clashes began on January 7 
with PKK militants throwing hand grenades at a panzer and 
continued until the next morning. Two individuals were wounded 
in the clashes and 35 workplaces were destroyed. The latter 
included buildings of the PTT [Post, Telephone, Telegraph 
office], Ziraat Bank and the bureau of the daily OZGUR GUNDEM. 
The fact that heavy weaponry such as antiaircraft, mortar and 
machine guns are used during the clashes means that serious 
damage has been caused. Naturally, security of life is the main 
problem. No one is safe. The people of Cizre have started to 
pay the price of the support they have given to the PKK. Ties 
have now been cut off completely before the elections. The most 
apparent outcome of this fact is that village guards have a say 
in all parts of the town. 
<H5>  The Village Guard System </H5>
  The village guard system has been set up in accordance with 
Village Law No. 442. Guards are selected according to 
provisions set out in the law. Under this law, guards are 
assigned only in their respective villages. However, in 
practice, they are away from their villages for days and weeks 
at a time, and they even participate in cross-border operations. 
As is the case in the Cizre example, they can take people in 
custody and question them. The village guard system exceeded 
its legal base a long time ago and has been operating outside 
the law. Village guards have become people who commit crimes in 
the name of the state with the power they get from the state. 
The main characteristics of the village guards is their being 
selected from among the pro-state Kurdish tribes. In a way it 
may also be termed a paid military service. However, it is also 
true that besides those volunteer village guards there are also 
those who are forced to become village guards. It is known that 
those who refuse to become village guards encounter dangers, 
including death. In their respective regions, village guards 
have established a system which resembles autonomous authority. 
For example, Chief Village Guard Alihan Tatar, who lives in a 
fort-like house in Sirnak, has put a Turkish flag on top of his 
house and declared his autonomy. 
  The fact that a concrete development has not yet been 
achieved in the solution of the Kurdish matter, which is one of 
Turkey's major problems, makes the local elections, which are to 
be held on March 27, all the more significant. 
  The most important expectation of the people in the region 
is 
that they will experience fair and democratic elections. 
However, this does not seem possible. It is clearly seen that 
both the state and the PKK will exert pressure during the 
elections. 
  As a matter of fact, everything has now started to be 
treated 
almost in humorous terms. Fundamental terms such as legislation 
and law have almost lost their significance. One incident, 
which could become the subject of a joke, occurred in Bitlis. A 
total of 79 civil servants, who work at state offices such as 
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Village and 
Rural Affairs Authority, have been sent to provinces like Tokat, 
Kayseri and Cankiri on the grounds that they have provided 
assistance to the PKK. The Office of the Chief of General Staff 
reportedly wanted those people to be followed in their new areas 
as well. However there is one point to be made here--and this 
is where the humor lies--the law calls for a prison term ranging 
from two to five years for those who assist an illegal 
organization and requires trial by state security courts.

  [Text] Hopes that Sinn Fein will announce a ceasefire in 
Northern Ireland when it holds its annual conference in Dublin 
at the end of this month collapsed today when the party made it 
that clear its decision-making process would continue into March. 
  Sinn Fein said it would hold a public "Peace Commission" in 
Belfast a week after the conference. 
  The party -- the IRA's political wing -- has been holding 
the 
sessions all over Ireland. 
  The announcement dashed rising speculation that the British 
and Irish saw the republicans' annual gathering as the platform 
for the announcement of their response to the Downing Street 
Declaration signed by John Major and Albert Reynolds on December 
15. 
  Neither London nor Dublin has put a time limit on a Sinn 
Fein 
response. 
  But both have shown increasing signs of impatience at the 
long delay and had pinned hopes on Sinn Fein president Gerry 
Adams delivering an answer at the conference. 
  Sinn Fein spokesman Richard McAuley said today: "The 
consultation process will not be complete but it does not 
devalue the Ard Fheis (annual conference). 
  "It provides republicans in Ireland with their first 
opportunity to come together in a national forum to discuss the 
peace process." 
  But Social Democratic and Labour Party deputy leader Seamus 
Mallon predicted that the IRA would give up terrorism and that 
the republican movement would enter the political process -- 
although not yet. 
  Mr Mallon, MP for Newry and Armagh, said he was more 
convinced than ever that peace was on the way. 
  "I think they will have a cessation of violence. I think 
they are on the road to peace," he said. 
  "I think they are having difficulties in doing that and I 
did 
not expect them to have anything but difficulties. I think it 
will be longer than people think, more tortuous than people 
believe, but it will happen, I am convinced of that." 
  Mr Mallon told the BBC Radio Ulster programme, Inside 
Politics, that the cessation of violence would come from within 
the republican movement. 
  There was a "burning desire" for peace within the whole 
community and the section within the republican movement which 
wanted to continue the violence would find it impossible to 
sustain it in the face of that public desire. 
  But people should realise that it would be a slow process.

<F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent Ian Graham] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Belfast headquarters of the IRA's political 
wing Sinn Fein was damaged in a rocket attack today. Local 
people said a rocket was fired from a car parked across the 
street from Connelly House in the Andersonstown Road. 
  Sinn Fein said the missile went through an upstairs window 
and exploded in an office, parts of the warhead imbedding 
themselves in a wall. No one was in the building at the time, 
but a Sinn Fein spokesman said a meeting of party members had 
been due to start there soon afterwards. 
  Last Monday, a booby-trapped grenade, planted by the 
loyalist 
Ulster Freedom Fighters, was defused at the security gate 
outside the building. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams visited 
the scene soon after the attack and accused the security forces 
of collusion in today's attack and others on Sinn Fein members 
in recent years. 
  "Loyalist death squads are operating with a high degree of 
intelligence information on individuals, offices and the 
movement of Crown forces patrols," he said. He insisted Sinn 
Fein would not be intimidated or deterred by the attacks from 
its search for peace. He claimed recent attacks were carried out 
with weapons provided to loyalists by British intelligence.

strongly condemns tourism in Egypt, and outlines plans for a 
"campaign against investment." Five days later, the Islamic 
Group fired on a bus carrying Romanian engineers in Asyut. The 
group's statement said the attack is part of its "campaign 
against foreign investors and tourists." 
<H5>  France </H5>
  The Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) announced on 
17 February that it was resuming its military activities after 
an eight-month truce.

  The chairman of the Serb Royalist Movement said that if 
NATO launches air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions on 20 
February, "a special unit" would attack UNPROFOR. Also, Serb 
military leader Manojlo Milovanovic said that all foreigners in 
Serb-held territory would be taken hostage and possibly killed 
in the event of a NATO air strike. 
<H5>  Sudan </H5>
  A Cairo opposition paper quotes National Islamic Front 
official al-Sanussi: "If the signs of this apostasy begin to 
appear on our land, they must consider their ambassadors and

brothers residing in their countries are offering sacrifices to 
God." 
<H5>  Turkey </H5>
  The military wing of the PKK took credit for planting a

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  AL-HADATH Director Receives Threat </H5>
  Rabat daily AL-MAGHRIB has reported that the staff of 
Tunisian Arabic-language weekly AL-HADATH received a telephone 
call on 29 December directed at the manager-chief editor, 
demanding that he "stop writing about the (Muslim) brothers; 
otherwise he will suffer the same fate as Faraj Foudah." 
Additional threats were made on 30 and 31 December. AL-HADATH 
reportedly stated that management attached "little importance" 
to these threats, attributing them to "traffickers in religion" 
and to "plain assassins," and noting, "This strengthens our 
belief that we are on the right track--that of fighting for 
Tunisia." (Rabat AL-MAGHRIB 1 Jan 94)

  [Excerpt] Jordan's King Husayn has said that the killers of 
the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut, at the end of last month, 
belong to an extremist group that received orders from an Arab 
country. The king did not disclose the name of that country. 
An official Jordanian source, however, told our radio that the 
Arab country is Libya and that the group, which carried out the 
operation, is Fatah-the Revolutionary Council led by Abu-Nidal 
[Sabri al-Banna]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Three Arab citizens were arrested 24 hours after an 
attack on a New York bus carrying a number of Jewish Americans. 
One was killed and three others were injured in the attack. 
One of the arrested Arabs is a Lebanese named Asad Baz who was 
charged with attempted murder. The other two, Malay Muhammad 
and Bassam Riyati, both Jordanians, are accused of possessing 
weapons and obstructing justice. 
  The New York police chief said that detectives found what he 
described as a veritable arsenal in the home of the Lebanese 
suspect. When asked if there was a link between the attack on 
the Jewish Americans in New York and the Hebron massacre, the 
police chief said that he did not rule out any possibility.

  [Excerpt] Accra, 2 Mar (GNA/PANA) -- [passage omitted on 
rioting] Meanwhile, police said three persons were injured 
Tuesday night when a grenade exploded at the yam market in 
Accra, popularly known as "Kokomba market" because the Kokombas 
who are mainly yam farmers are engaged in the supply and 
distribution of the food stuff to that market. They named the 
three, who were described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric 
Danso, on admission with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who 
had been treated and discharged. 
  "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no 
one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a 
spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern 
region," they said. 
  They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of 
the 
incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade 
exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen 
in the market area about the time of the incident and that 
investigations are going on. 
  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed 
indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the 
entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo 
regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 26 KYODO -- The Japanese Red Army, a 
radical group based in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley, has sent a 
document explaining their operations to supporters in Japan and 
calling for more support, sources familar with the group said 
Saturday [26 February]. 
  The document, titled "Let's Become Guerrilla Warriors," 
tells 
in detail about how the extremist group spend their daily lives 
and engage in training as guerrillas. The document is about 
140,000 words long. 
  The document was likely written before an agreement last 
September between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) on Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied 
territories. 
  The Red Army has been working under the Popular Front for 
the 
Liberation of Palestine, a more militant arm of the PLO. 
  The paper describes the group's military training and daily 
lives in camps where they said they can watch international 
satellite news programs such as Cable News Network. 
  They wake up at 6:00 a.m. and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. and 
when there is a holiday or a member has a birthday they make 
Japanese traditional foods such as rice balls and 
"kamaage-udon," the document said. 
  The extremists, always carrying handguns and wearing 
military 
uniforms mainly made in South Korea, live in block-like huts in 
the summer and winter and live in tents the rest of the year. 
  The group calls for more support from Japan, saying "the day 
will come when the world will be united as one. It depends on 
us, and your way of life and strife." 
  Japanese authorities, noting there is a plan by supporters 
in 
Japan to publish the document as a book, said the paper was 
written in a more gentle manner than previously done and that 
the group aims to appeal to a larger audience. 
  The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series 
of 
hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 
massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.

  [Text] The Abu Sayyaf problem will not die the way other 
insurgent groups might, a Basilan official said yesterday. 
  This, according to Gov. Abdulgani "Gerry" Salapuddin, is 
because the Islamic religion is being used to fuel the 
commitment of the group's members to turn Mindanao into an 
Islamic state. 
  Basilan is where the group started to gain prominence and 
followings. It was founded by Islamic leader Abdulajik 
Janjalani. 
  The military has described the group as "the third force" to 
reckon with in Mindanao, after the Moro National Liberation 
Front [MNLF] and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). 
  "This (Abu Sayyaf problem) is more difficult to solve than 
mere insurgency," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. He said the 
insurgency problems are rooted on political and economic factors. 
  Once these factors are addressed in a sustained manner, "the 
issue will die down by itself," he said. "But not extremism 
because ideas and beliefs don't die." 
  It is likely, he said, that the group will not give in to 
any 
concession short of the establishment of an Islamic government 
in Mindanao. 
  Abu Sayyaf members are ready to die for their cause, 
believing they will go to heaven (or surgah) if they die 
fighting. 
  Salapuddin, a former MNLF commander, continued: "They will 
be accorded martyrdom by Allah if they are killed in combat. 
This is what new members are taught. It is difficult to 
re-orient them otherwise." 
  It is the appeal on religious extremism, Salapuddin said, 
that contributes to the growing appeal of the group to new 
members in Mindanao and in Metro Manila. 
  "Extremism catches fire," he said. 
  Moreover, the group is reported to be targeting both the 
Muslim intellectuals and the poor fishermen "who are not 
educated enough to know the true meaning of Islam." 
  But the majority of more than four million Muslims here are 
reportedly not supportive of the cause and ideal propagated by 
the Abu Sayyaf. 
  "Islam espouses moderation, anything that is extreme is not 
what Islam teaches," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. 
  He urged local government leaders in Mindanao to mobilize 
the 
local "moderate" Muslim leaders to "counter the spread of 
extremism," which had reportedly reached many Muslim-populated 
barangays [villages] in Mindanao and Metro Manila. 
  Meanwhile, he said the top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf have 
left Basilan for other places in the country. 
  He could not say where they have gone to, but he gave this 
hint: "Where bombs are exploding, where terrorist activities are 
-- you can guess they have leaders there."

  [Text] Key opposition leaders suspect "political 
intimidation" aimed at silencing them as the reason for the bomb 
attack on the home of Social Action Party secretary-general 
Bunphan Khaewatthana early yestersday. 
  The group reached their conclusion at a luncheon meeting at 
Princess Hotel after a hand grenade was lobbed into the home of 
the former public health minister off Vibhavadi-Rangsit Highway 
shortly before 2 a.m. 
  But the allegation was immediately rejected by Prime 
Minister 
Chuan Likphai who said the Government was not involved. 
  "I really don't know how this happened, but it is definitely 
not what the Opposition said," he said. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchawiwa said: "This 
Government respects the basic right of people to criticise its 
performance," he said. 
  "We can live with those with different opinions because our 
society is an open one. And we can use the same right to argue 
and defend ourselves. 
  "There is no need for this government to resort to illegal 
means or violence. That's not the nature of this government or 
politicians in this government." 
  Yesterday's meeting was attended by Opposition and Chat Thai 
leader Praman Adireksan, Chat Phattana [CPP] leader Chatchai 
Chunhawan, SAP [Social Action Party] leader Montri Phongphanit, 
Ratsadon leader Chaipak Siriwat, Chat Thai deputy leader Sano 
Thianthong, CPP secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan, SAP deputy 
leader Suwit Khunkitti and SAP secretary-general Chaloem 
Yubamrung. 
  Mr Montri, the nephew of Mr Bunphan and a resident of the 
same compound in Soi Pannee, said he was confident the bomb 
attack was intended more as intimidation than actually hurting 
anyone. 
  He said he had recently been pointing out the Government's 
shortcomings to people during the city and district council 
election campaign. 
  "So this is apparently aimed at preventing the Opposition 
from telling the people the truth," he said. 
  "I have thought it over and I cannot see why anyone would 
ever want to hurt Mr Bunphan. We finally concluded it was an 
act of intimidation. 
  "But I don't know who could be behind this act because we 
don't have any personal problems with anyone." 
  Mr Montri said he respected Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. 
  "By nature, we are political enemies. We criticise the 
Government because we want it to work and it must listen to us. 
I am really sorry. Anyone who sees what happened will know how 
violent it was." 
  The politician said he and other Opposition leaders would 
not 
seek extra protection during the remaining campaign period, but 
would continue to inform the people of the problems in the 
Government. 
  Pol Capt [Police Captain] Chaloem said he did not think 
police would be able to arrest anyone in connection with the 
attack. 
  "It's just intimidation and only those who were behind it 
know who the perpetrators are," he said. 
  "This kind of thing never happens to people in the 
Government 
but is frequent with Opposition members." 
  Pol Capt Chaloem later told the BANGKOK POST at Mr Montri's 
home a police officer who is a younger brother of a senior 
official with the Prime Minister's Office and the bodyguard of a 
Democrat minister might be responsible for the attack because of 
Mr Montri's rude criticisms of Prime Minister Chuan during 
political activities. 
  SAP deputy leader Dusit Sophitcha, in a separate interview, 
said the bomb attack was the work of "a third hand" to distract 
the public attention from conflicts within the coalition. 
  Mr Aphisit said it was the duty of the police to find who 
was 
behind the attack and the Opposition should provide evidence if 
they can help investigators locate the culprits. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian called on the 
public to treat the Government fairly over the incident.

  [Text] Zlin, South Moravia March 2 (CTK) -- Police 
discovered 18 kilos of red Semtex hidden in a car during a 
routine check early on Monday [28 February] morning, the 
director of Zlin Criminal Police told CTK on Wednesday [2 March]. 
  The driver of the car, 20-year-old T.S., has been released 
uncharged. He is thought to be the middleman but has not 
revealed any details of accomplices. The find would have a 
value of about 100,000 DM [German marks] on the German market. 
The police rule out any connection with the 42.5 kilos of red 
Semtex discovered in Prostejov, South Moravia, last month.

  [Text] Aida Ruales de Laso, the wife of the Putumayo State 
governor, has been released after being held captive for 72 
hours by a new guerrilla group. According to reports from 
authorities, apparently a new subversive group calling itself 
the Putumayo Liberation Organization [Organizacion Para la 
Liberacion de Putumayo], whose members are EPL [Popular 
Liberation Army] dissidents, was responsible for the kidnapping. 
The objective of the guerrillas was to obtain money to 
strengthen their movement economically. 
  [Begin Ruales de Laso recording] I told them this was not 
the 
way to help the country. I told them that if we all worked 
together, but not the way they are doing things, Putumayo would 
advance. [end recording]

  [Text] The top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia [FARC] told TV Today that they will not sabotage the 13 
March elections and that they are drafting a political proposal 
for the country. They also promised not to kidnap any more 
mayors, but they warned that they will continue with their 
military actions until they achieve a peace agreement. Because 
of legal reasons we cannot transmit the voices of those who were 
interviewed, but in the next report we are going to present the 
basic points of their proposals. 
  The FARC members said they will not sabotage the next 
elections and guaranteed that people will be able to vote 
without any problems on 13 March. We absolutely agree the people 
should be allowed to express themselves by voting for the 
candidates they want as their representatives. We are not going 
to sabotage the elections because we believe it is the right of 
all our fellow countrymen, they said. 
  The FARC members note that if some politicians were withheld 
it was only temporarily and only to discuss their positions. We 
may decide to talk to someone as it is the only option we have. 
That is part of the activities conducted by each front, they 
said. 
  The FARC said they would continue to promote a proposal for 
a 
national reconstruction government. To achieve that they will 
continue to carry out propaganda activities and said the 
confrontation situation will continue. As long as there are no 
agreements the guerrillas will continue to operate. We are 
strong and have many possibilities, the FARC leaders said. 
  They say steps have been taken to join the National 
Liberation Army, and they support the peace process between the 
government and the Socialist Renewal Current. They say anything 
done for peace in Colombia is fine with them. 
  As for possible dialogues between the National Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board and the government, they say the time is not 
right and that the solution to the guerrilla problem is linked 
to the solution of the country's big problems.

  [Text] Francisco Galan, Army of National Liberation (ELN) 
leader, was transferred to Itagui maximum security prison in the 
last few hours. A petition for protection recognized the 
guerrilla's right not to remain in solitary confinement. There 
was intense activity at Itagui prison since early today. The 
unexpected transfer of Galan and Juan Fernando Ospina Montoya, 
alias El Gordo, a Medellin Cartel member, was carried out 
without a great fuss. 
  Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a 
National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a 
petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military 
garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. 
  Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard 
the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is 
in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya 
surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El 
Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to 
escape Envigado prison.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Liberation Army [ELN] guerrillas are 
reportedly financing political campaigns in Casanare, according 
to Colonel Alfonso Plazas Vega. The former commander of the 
Cavalry Academy, which in 1987 assumed control of the Justice 
Palace during the bloody takeover by the 19 April Movement, said 
the guerrillas are holding contacts with candidates through 
third parties to finance their campaigns. 
  [Begin recording] [Plazas] I am talking about candidates for 
governor and candidates for mayor in the municipalities of 
Yopal, Tauramena, and Aguazul. 
  [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] I do not believe the 
guerrillas have that kind of power in the political campaigns in 
Casanare. I am not aware that they are trying to exert 
influence on the political development of the region. 
  [Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] If that were the 
case, it must be condemned. [end recording] 
  According to Col. Plazas, the guerrillas are extorting 
businessmen by means of this system in Casanare. 
  [Begin Plazas recording] They are threatening candidates and 
asking them for allowances and if the allowances are not given 
they are included on a list of future kidnap victims in order to 
get the money anyway. [end recording] 
  Plazas Vega said that to solve the problem in Casanare, it 
is 
necessary to appoint military governors and mayors in that 
region of the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper] </F>
  [Excerpts] FBI sources in Miami have reported that 
representatives from the FBI and the Attorney General's Office 
will meet to determine whether or not the paramilitary group 
Alpha-66 should be investigated regarding several threatening 
letters circulating in Miami. In the notes, Alpha-66 warns that 
they will regard as military targets anyone anywhere in the 
world who visits Cuba, negotiates with the Cuban Government, or 
expresses support for this country. [passage omitted] 
  Orestes Joubert, Cubanacan deputy manager in Granma 
Province, 
reports that Alpha-66 has threatened Canadian tourists who made 
reservations at the new Farallon del Caribe Hotel last year. 
  [Begin Joubert recording] As we all know, this hotel was 
inaugurated in November after considerable hype. The number of 
reservations made in Canada in October was large. A large number 
of tourists were expected after November. Nevertheless, we found 
that this number had been greatly reduced because requests for 
visas for 40 percent of those who had made reservations had been 
turned down. We wondered about the situation. Through some 
Canadian papers we learned that a counterrevolutionary 
organization called Alpha-66 had unleashed a campaign against 
Cuba through newspapers and radio and television stations. Much 
to our satisfaction, however, this situation lasted only a few 
days. Since late December, 90 percent of the hotel rooms have 
remained occupied. [end recording] 
  This is new evidence showing that Alpha-66 attempts to 
prevent everyone from coming to Cuba with the specific purpose, 
in this particular instance, of blocking one of the country's 
leading development sectors. They did not prevail, but this 
attempt can be added to the long list of actions against Cuba 
when an inquiry is opened.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Jijon, with information from Cristian </F>
Zurita in Quito] 
  [Text] Described as a radical faction of the 
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (PCMLE), combined with 
dissidents from Alfaro Lives [AVC] and Montoneras Free 
Fatherland [MPL], "Red Sun" appears to be one of the two Shining 
Path [SL] groups in South America outside Peru. 
  The first time that the words "Red Sun" appeared in the 
Ecuadoran press was on 2 January 1992. Lost among the pages of 
the Red columns, the newspapers published the report of a 
dynamite attack on the Offices of the Supreme Electoral Court in 
Quito, which occurred during the night of 31 December 1991. That 
morning, a flyer had been circulating in the media editorial 
rooms. In it, a certain "General Ruminahui Revolutionary 
Commando" group took credit for the act. It also predicted the 
resumption of the armed struggle during 1992, hailed 
"Marxism-Leninism-Maoism," and called for a struggle on behalf 
of "the Red Sun of liberation." No one paid much attention. Nor 
had anyone done so in Lima 12 years earlier, when, during May 
1980 (a day before the elections), five hooded persons entered 
the electoral office in Chuschi, Ayacucho, tying up the official 
in charge and burning the ballot boxes. It marked the beginning 
of the Shining Path war, whose spread through Latin America 
apparently is being attempted. 
  During 1992, at least 14 attacks claimed by "Red Sun" were 
reported. Most of them were dynamite explosions in public 
offices during the early morning hours, explained as a rejection 
of the privatization plans of Sixto Duran Ballen's government. 
By 1993 (after Abimael Guzman's capture), "Red Sun's" activity 
had declined considerably: Only three attacks were reported, one 
on the trans-Ecuadoran oil pipeline (causing only minor damage). 
Although, last August, the defense minister, General (ret.) Jose 
Gallardo, after admitting the existence of "Red Sun" to the 
Congress, described it as "incipient and under control"; one 
fact is true: a minuscule Maoist group with a clearly Shining 
Path orientation has declared war against the Ecuadoran state. 
According to Simon Strong, a British journalist and expert on 
Shining Path, "The rebels have demonstrated that, once the phase 
of embryonic entrenchment in one locality has been completed, 
depending on the strategic circumstances, they will make their 
power felt." Unlike the Peruvian forces of order, those of 
Ecuador have one advantage: they have been warned. 
<H5>  Who Are They, Where Are They? </H5>
  What is known about "Red Sun"? Two years since the start of 
its armed activities, the state intelligence services are able 
to draw a profile: It is a small Maoist group (calling for the 
prolonged people's war), consisting of approximately 50 
militants (and some 300 sporadic sympathizers), operating 
primarily in university environments. They are headed by a 
central committee, consisting of five members whose names are 
unknown, and which is structured in the form of regional and 
base committees. For the present, the group's power appears very 
slight, and its destiny, linked to the survival or nonsurvival 
of Shining Path, on which it depends ideologically, financially, 
and militarily. Its origin is not very clear: Police 
intelligence attributes it to a meeting of dissidents from 
Alfaro Lives and Montoneras Free Fatherland (held about 1990), 
headed by Kleber Gia Bustamante. According to naval 
intelligence, however, its origin lies in the breakoff of a 
Maoist branch of the old Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of 
Ecuador, which reportedly has made contact with the 
International Revolutionary Movement, the Communist 
International, over which Abimael Guzman wields an influence. 
  The police theory (pointing to Alfaro Lives dissidents) 
agrees with the findings of the Peruvian police investigations. 
In 1991, Victor Malca, the Peruvian interior minister, claimed 
that Shining Path was possibly allied with a faction of Alfaro 
Lives. He remarked: "They say that they have laid down their 
arms, but there is a small group among them apparently linked 
with Shining Path, and operating in the Piura sierra region, 
near Huancabamba." Marco Troya, an AVC leader, denied the story, 
asserting: "Although we respect Shining Path, we do not agree 
with its methods." Edgar Frias, one of the two survivors of the 
AVC central commando group, commented: "I was in Peru, but 
Shining Path was something totally different; we had no 
relationship whatsoever." Pedro Moncada, one of the high-ranking 
cadres in AVC, which is currently attempting to become a legal 
party, gave a forceful denial: "We do not know anything about 
it." 
  Nevertheless, the Naval Intelligence Service has followed a 
different path: Its members claim that "Red Sun" is the armed 
representative of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Communist Party of 
Ecuador (PCMLE-Maoist), a radical faction of the 
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador. They call it an 
organization that has proposed the "armed struggle" since 1964, 
when it broke off from the Communist Party, linked 
internationally with Moscow. 
  Nicknamed "the Chinese," because it is identified with Mao 
Tse-Tung's revolution and the People's Republic of China, the 
PCMLE maintained a critical position toward the electoral 
system. It developed mainly in university environments and in 
the teachers' union organization, but became increasingly 
distant from Beijing until about 1975, when its linkage with the 
Communist Party of Albania began. In 1979, PCMLE militants 
became established as a political party, taking as its name the 
Democratic People's Movement [MPD]. 
  Although it is denied officially, the MPD is considered the 
legal and public representative of the PCMLE, operating in the 
teachers' union through the National Union of Teachers, UNE, and 
in university environments through the University Leftist 
Revolutionary Front, FRIU. 
  Clandestine, and governed by a five-member central 
committee, 
the PCMLE reportedly received a delegation from the Shining Path 
organization in Europe during 1989, to propose its affiliation 
with the Peruvian revolution. The details are unknown, but the 
central committee apparently refused to submit to "Gonzalo's 
Thought" (as Abimael Guzman's philosophy is called). The 
dissidents, who were expelled, became united in the 
PCMLE-Maoist. According to naval intelligence, that same year 
they reportedly joined with the dissidents from Alfaro Lives and 
Montoneras Free Fatherland. 
<H5>  From Mao to Guzman </H5>
  "For 29 years, the PCMLE has preached armed struggle without 
ever moving to action." This statement was made by an 
"ex-Chinese" who was later a militant in Alfaro Lives. Now a 
member of the group that surrendered its arms to the Rodrigo 
Borja government, he is attempting to form a new political 
party, Patriotic Union. He added: "That preaching of armed 
struggle is the principal means of attracting members but, since 
nothing ever happens, there is never a move to action. As soon 
as they arrive, they leave. For that reason, if those dissidents 
are involved, it is possible that a faction of the PCMLE has 
succumbed to the influence of President Gonzalo" (the title by 
which Abimael Guzman is known). 
  That preaching of armed struggle and the PCMLE's development 
in university environments have prompted the state intelligence 
services to discern a possible "Red Sun" stronghold at Guayaquil 
University. They cite a student demonstration on the outskirts 
of the university compound in September 1992, against the 
government's economic measures. During it, slogans were chanted 
calling for the release of Abimael Guzman, then recently 
captured in Lima. They also cite the statements made by an 
ex-FRIU militant, Joffre Macias, a student of obstetrics at 
Guayaquil University. In September 1993, he assured the press 
that "Red Sun" would have its base of operations at Guayaquil 
University, and would be headed by the MPD. 
  Gabriel Cabrera, spokesman for the PCMLE in Guayas, 
declared: 
"I believe that `Red Sun' is a creation of naval intelligence, 
and they want to implicate us, because we are the only ones 
maintaining the basic principles of the revolution in this 
country." Immediately after Joffre Macias's accusations, the 
ex-MPD deputy, Jaime Hurtado, denied them; and the present 
deputy and UNE leader, Juan Jose Castello, called the defense 
minister to Congress. General (ret.) Jose Gallardo neither 
confirmed nor denied anything. He commented: "Military 
intelligence has not prepared any report intended to establish 
the links that might exist between `Red Sun' and the MPD." He 
also stated that "Red Sun" exists, and that its members have 
been identified, as have the national and foreign organizations 
with which they are connected. 
  Based on the statements of Jaime Cortez Pozo (a 19-year-old 
Quito native and university student, the first one arrested on 
charges of belonging to "Red Sun"), a November 1993 police 
report cited Kleber Gia Bustamante as a member of the "Red Sun" 
central committee. His present whereabouts are a mystery. His 
father, Clemente Gia Gia, claims: "After 13 years of struggle he 
obtained his release, and is now enjoying all his citizen's 
rights. He is a scholar, an ideologue, who has been in Europe 
for years, studying and working on research." If he has joined 
the International Revolutionary Movement, as the security 
services think, it is likely that we shall have more news about 
him sooner or later. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  Kleber Gia: In "Red Sun"? </H5>
  Kleber Elias Gia Bustamante, accused by the police of being 
a 
member of the "Red Sun" central committee, has been living 
clandestinely since his escape from the Garcia Moreno Prison, 
where he was held accused of assassinating the industrialist, 
Jose Antonio Briz Lopez. In October 1990, the third judge of 
criminal proceedings in Pichincha, Gonzalo Falconi, pronounced 
the invalidity of the process by prescription. Since then, 
Kleber Gia has been legally free; however, his whereabouts are 
unknown. According to his father, he is living in Europe, a 
claim corroborated by his ex-comrades from M-19: "Kleber was 
never a Maoist. His ideological training is incompatible with 
Shining Path."

  [Text] Although the PNP [Peruvian National Police] high 
command has denied it, over 20 PNP officers assigned to the 
National Counterterrrorism Directorate (DINCOTE), were 
transferred over the last few days to the National Intelligence 
Service (SIN). 
  Reliable sources have informed EXPRESO that the transfers 
occurred at the end of January, and that it included a 
high-ranking DINCOTE colonel and other PNP unit chiefs. 
  It must be noted that EXPRESO was the first to report, at 
the 
beginning of February, that the PNP had implemented a 30 percent 
reduction in DINCOTE personnel. 
  This reduction is part of the announced "streamlining" of 
police force personnel, which was disclosed not so long ago by 
PNP General Director Victor Alva Plasencia. 
  According to the same source, DINCOTE has already submitted 
to the PNP General Staff the names of the 300 DINCOTE agents who 
will be fired. 
  The officer added that it is still unknown whether all of 
these agents will be transferred to the SIN or to other police 
units, and that this situation is causing uncertainty among 
DINCOTE personnel.

  [Text] Lima, 1 Mar (EFE) -- Daniel Espichan Tumay, the 
Republic of Peru's special prosecutor for terrorist crimes, 
stressed today that by 18 February 1,699 terrorists had sought 
shelter under the Repentance Law issued by the government. 
  The prosecutor added that 1,055 belong to the Shining Path 
Maoist gang and 644 to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA). 
  The prosecutor noted that thus far five repented terrorists 
have left Peru under a new identity in order to lead a different 
life in another country, thanks to the valuable information they 
supplied that allowed the breaking up of subversive groups. 
  Espichan added that he has been concerned about the defense 
of eight journalists under arrest for allegedly promoting 
terrorist crimes who belonged to the newspaper DIARIO DE MARKA, 
a leftist newspaper seized by the Shining Path that now 
circulates clandestinely from time to time in a very small 
format. 
  The Republic of Peru's special prosecutor pointed out that 
he 
has constantly been in touch with Journalists Association head 
Miguel Calderon Paz in order to individually handle the cases 
involving these journalists and quickly secure the release of 
those journalists who are not criminally liable. 
  The prosecutor also has recommended painstakingly checking 
reports supplied by the repented terrorists because some of them 
have been false and led to the detention of innocent people.

  [Text] Khartoum (Exclusive to AL-AHALI) -- There was an 
attempt to assassinate Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
during the popular Islamic conference held recently in Khartoum. 
  According to security reports received from a non-Sudanese 
party, the Sudanese security forces were forced to arrest three 
persons, one of them a diplomat from the Iranian embassy and two 
Lebanese. In addition, they seized pistols equipped with 
silencers and poisoned daggers. The whole case was shrouded in 
complete secrecy until the conference was over and then the 
three were deported. 
  The conference cost 320 million Sudanese pounds and was 
attended by representatives of 27 Islamic organizations in 
Egypt, China, Kashmir, the former Soviet republics, Morocco, 
Nigeria, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. The 
conference was held at two levels: an open one held at the 
Friendship Hall and a secret one held at the camps center in 
Sawba. These secret sessions focused on studying the 
development of terrorist operations. Ayman al-Zawahiri [one of 
the leaders of the Islamic Group in Egypt] addressed the 
conference and stressed that his organization recognizes Hala'ib 
as Sudanese. He attacked the Sudanese opposition and said 
anyone who opposes the Islamic regime in Sudan is a traitor. He 
also said that his group is ready to liquidate the Sudanese 
regime's opponents in Cairo if the Sudanese government asks it. 
  At its secret sessions the conference discussed the status 
of 
the Islamic movements in various countries. It agreed that the 
Islamic movement in Libya should improve its relations with 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's regime in order to gain a measure of 
stability and legitimacy and become the alternative if any 
changes occur. 
  The conference also discussed the possibility of Iran giving 
direct and practical support should an Islamic movement start in 
the United Arab Emirates. 
  It was also announced at the secret sessions that much 
backing has been given to the terrorist movement in Algeria 
through the dispatch of weapons across the Algerian-Libyan 
borders. 
  The conferees strongly criticized the Islamic movement in 
Tunis because its tactics are not compatible with the situation 
and because of its refusal to use overt violence. The conferees 
were informed that armed action will start soon, after a number 
of trained Tunisian terrorists have been smuggled into that 
country. Agreement was also reached on supporting the Islamic 
movement in Uganda. 
  A committee with al-Fatih 'Urwah as chairman and Colonel 
'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abdallah 'Ali and Sudanese Ambassador in Ethiopia 
'Uthman al-Sayyid as members was formed to manage the terrorist 
operations against the regimes in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The 
conferees decided to exert pressure on Pakistan to prevent it 
from extraditing the "mujahidin" or deporting them. The 
conference also decided to set up an "International Jihad Fund" 
headquartered in Sudan under Ibrahim al-Sanusi with the aim of 
funding and coordinating terrorist actions in various countries. 
  Iran announced it will contribute $10 million as a first 
installment. 
  From the secret sessions it emerged that Ayman al-Zawahiri 
and Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz Musa are residing in Sudan, contrary 
to what some believe, and have full freedom of movement. We 
have also learned that Tal'at Yasin, whom Egyptian authorities 
believe to be in Peshawar, succeeded in returning secretly to 
Cairo some time ago and was one of the ones who planned the 
attempts to assassinate [Interior Minister] Hasan al-Alfi and 
[Prime Minister] Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. 
  The actual number of Egyptians who were in Afghanistan was 
2,500, of whom 600 had left Pakistan before the Egyptian 
security delegation arrived there. Most of the others had 
travelled to Sudan and Yemen. A secret committee chaired by 
Ibrahim al-Sanusi has been formed to take charge of providing 
them with a livelihood, continuing their training, and smuggling 
them into Egypt.

<F P=106> [Jamal Khashuqji report: "Hamas Executed DFLP Leader in </F>
Gaza"] 
  [Excerpt] Jeddah -- Relations between the Islamic 
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] have deteriorated seriously after 
Hamas announced that its armed squads in Gaza executed Yusuf 
Abu-Lafi, head of the DFLP military organ in the Gaza Strip. 
  In a statement issued by "the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads," 
Hamas accused Abu-Lafi (27 years) of having been "an Israeli 
agent." It distributed a videotape of his confessions. 
  The incident marks a further deterioration in the relations 
between the two parties, which are members of the Damascus-based 
Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Hamas's official spokesman in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal has 
stated that the DFLP's protest against the execution of the head 
of its military organ in Gaza was strange. He told AL-HAYAH 
that the videotape and the confessions of Yusuf Abu-Lafi "were 
sufficient explanation." He stressed that Hamas had given the 
factions allied with it, especially the DFLP, the details 
pertaining to that issue. He added: "It is the general policy 
of Hamas to inform the faction to which an uncovered agent 
belongs of the details, and it will continue to do so." He 
emphasized that "purging the Palestinian factions of agents is 
one of the important programs which all factions should 
cooperate with it to fulfill." 
  The DFLP, however, has protested the incident and described 
the dead man as "a revolutionary commander and a patriotic 
struggler known to the masses of the Khan Yunis camp as one of 
their righteous sons." That came in a DFLP memorandum 
submitted to the APF leadership during its meeting in Damascus 
last Saturday requesting an end to such incidents. 
  Before Hamas claimed responsibility for killing Abu-Lafi, 
the 
DFLP in the Gaza Strip issued several statements describing 
Abu-Lafi as "an honorable struggler" abducted "while performing 
a struggle duty." They accused the abductors of being "agents 
of the occupation authorities" and threatened revenge if he was 
harmed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An incident has occurred in Sidon that might be 
linked to the Hebron massacre and the PLO's stand on it. 
Security sources in Sidon said that unidentified gunmen have 
assassinated Sidqi Farhud, brother of 'Ali Farhud, the Fatah 
intelligence service chief in the Sidon area. According to the 
latest information, gunmen opened fire from a vehicle at Sidqi, 
50 years old, and his 22-year-old son while they were driving in 
the Sidon port area. Sidqi died immediately but his son, who 
was slightly injured, managed to drive the vehicle to a nearby 
hospital.

  [Excerpts] Occupied Jerusalem--Quds Press--[passage 
omitted] In its statement Hamas said: This statement is a 
warning to the people. The statement starts with the Koranic 
verse: "And they ill-treated them for no other reason than that 
they believed in God, exalted in power, worthy of all praise." 
SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes the text of the statement: 
  O brave men of Hebron. O the lions of Gaza. O the heroes of 
Nabulus. O the guardians of al-Aqsa Mosque. O the knights of 
Ramallah and Bethlehem. O the enduring masses in all our towns, 
villages and camps. O the men, women, youth, and children. 
Declare it a fresh revolution against the occupation. Cry out 
Allah Akbar [God is great] and let these cries tear out the 
hearts of the criminal Zionist occupiers. Let the hearts of the 
malicious settlers tremble. Pursue the occupation soldiers and 
attack the gangs of settlers and slay them wherever you catch 
them for things have come to a head and all the deception has 
been uncovered. [passage omitted condemning Hebron massacre] 
Let the veil drop from the eyes of those who have illusions 
about peace with the enemy. Let the symbols of capitulation -- 
those of Madrid, Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, who are crouching 
in Tunis watching the wounds of our people and nation -- fall. 
[passage omitted] 
  Be united and do not allow any traitor or people with weak 
spirits to join your ranks. Censure the capitulationists and 
defeatists, force them to abide by your hopes and aspirations, 
and block the road between them and the enemy. Let the 
demonstrations and mass rallies take to the streets. Engage 
with the soldiers and the herds of settlers. Let the heroes 
pursue the settlers and turn their settlements into jails and 
let them shed the blood of the rancorous Zionists in the streets 
of the settlements. 
  We in Hamas call for the following: [passage omitted] 
  On 11 March, the last Friday in Ramadan, we urge all our 
people to travel to holy Jerusalem to perform the Friday prayer 
at the al-Aqsa Mosque. We urge them to defy the occupation 
authorities and the siege and curfew, and to perform the prayer, 
even on the walls of the al-Aqsa Mosque if necessary. 
  On 'Id al-Fitr day, we urge the people to perform the 'Id 
prayer outside mosques in open yards, in accordance with the 
Prophet's teachings. We also urge them to visit the families of 
the martyrs, wounded, and detainees and the patients, and to 
help the poor and the needy. 
  On 14 March, we call for staging mass rallies, to be 
attended 
in particular by the families of the martyrs, wounded, and 
detainees. We also urge the demonstrations to proceed to the 
homes of the members of the negotiating team to urge them to 
withdraw completely from the negotiations and to join the 
resistance against occupation. 
  Allahu Akbar. Victory to our mujahid people.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Reliable sources have confirmed 
to AL-HAYAH that Cheik Ali Djeddi and Cheik Abdelkader 
Boukhamkham, who were released three days ago, did, in the first 
move since their release, visit Cheik Ahmad Sahnun, leader of 
the Islamic Da'wah [call] League who is considered by many to be 
a scholar and jurist who can stop the acts of violence to a 
large extent if he appeals to the Armed Islamic Groups to that 
effect. Initial information indicates that Cheik Sahnun 
received a message about the dialogue between the Army and the 
FIS and ways of participating in the transitional phase. 
  In that context, sources have told AL-HAYAH that the FIS 
leaders who have not been released yet, namely Abdelkader Omar, 
Noureddine Cheghara, and Abdelkader Hachani, have been moved to 
the military hospital in Ain El Neja [as transliterated] "for 
important medical tests before their release." They added that 
the release would be completed before 'Id al-Fitr. [passage

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 28 (MAP) -- President and 
vice-president of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) 
Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, serving a 12-year jail term each 
since 1992, were reportedly released, Algerian daily `LIBERTE' 
said Saturday. 
  Certain sources said the two FIS leaders were put under 
house 
arrest in Douera (suburb south-east of Algiers) while others 
said they were in Zeralda (31 km west of Algiers). 
  According to the daily, other party leaders could have been 
freed last week. The releases, added the daily, are part of a 
general amnesty which is likely to take place before the end of 
the holy month of Ramadan.

  [Text] It was learned today from the security services that 
Mourad Sid Ahmed, alias Djaafar El Afghani, the leader of the 
Armed Islamic Group [GIA] and nine members of his group were 
liquidated yesterday in the Algiers heights. The name of 
Djaafar El Afghani was linked to the kidnapping of three French 
citizens on 24 October 1993 outside their home in Krim Belkacem 
street. They were Mr. and Mrs. Tivano and Mr. Allan. The 
second case in which Djaafar El Afghani was implicated was the 
kidnapping of Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, the chairman of the 
Irshad and Islah [Guidance and Reform] charity society from his 
home in Blida last November. [see SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in the

  [Text] Algeria, February 27 (MENA)--Abbas Madani and Ali 
Belhaj, leaders of the banned National Salvation Front [FIS], 
will not start contacts with the Algerian authorities before 
reaching an agreement with leaders of militant groups on halting 
acts of tension in Algeria to prepare conditions for the start 
of a dialogue between the government and the front, MENA learned 
here today. Well-placed sources said the two FIS leaders 
currently in prison made direct contacts with leaders of Islamic 
militant movements including Muhammad Saied and Saied Makhlufi 
[names as received]. Some of the militant leaders described 
contacts with the FIS as fruitful and others kept silent. 
  The FIS leaders seek amnesty for all political detainees as 
well as the adoption of measures to hold general elections in 
Algeria. The Algerian authorities are expected to release, 
within a few days, a number of FIS leaders currently in prison. 
This trend comes within the context of the plan of Algerian 
President Liamine Zeroual to calm conditions in Algeria and 
start a comprehensive dialogue in which the banned FIS will take 
part. The Algerian authorities on Tuesday, released two of the 
FIS leaders in a step the first of its kind to be adopted by the 
Algerian Government. Observers said Algeria has witnessed a 
relative calm and stability since the release of Haddi and 
Abdulkader Khamkham [names as received] on Tuesday. Acts of 
violence or threats against foreigners have not been recorded 
since that day, and [words indistinct] contacts between the FIS 
and militant groups.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Concha Flores reports from 
Alicante airport. Good afternoon. 
  [Flores] Good afternoon. It appears that there are 
developments taking place right now, namely that the women and 
children who were aboard the Air Algerie Boeing 727 may be 
disembarking. This is a report that we have just received and 
cannot be confirmed because of how far away the aircraft is 
being held on the runway -- quite a long way from the central 
installations of l'Altet airport. [passage omitted] 
  The extensive police deployment has not affected the normal 
functioning of the airport, where flights are still arriving and 
leaving. The base of operations is in the control tower where 
they are being headed by Civil Governor Alfonso Calve, along 
with the provincial chief inspector, the acting Civil Guard 
chief, the recently appointed Algerian consul in Alicante, who 
took up his post this morning, and a military member from the 
Alcantarilla base. 
  [Madrid Teletexto TVE in Spanish at 1525 GMT on 28 February 
reports that: "Eight women, two men, and two children have left 
the hijacked Algerian aircraft, which landed at Alicante 
airport.]

themselves up to the Spanish police. [passage omitted] Concha

  [Flores] A few minutes ago, the spokesman for the Alicante 
Civil Government, Mariano Soriano, told us that at 1805 the 
three hijackers of this Air Algerie plane gave themselves up to 
the Spanish security forces who had cordoned off the plane. 
  It seems that negotiations that were taking place from the 
runway were effective and as we said the news has been 
officially confirmed by the civil government that the three 
hijackers have given themselves up. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Concha Flores reports: 
  [Flores] The three hijackers have given themselves up to the 
Spanish police but they cannot request political asylum because 
they are the perpetrators of a crime of air piracy. Therefore 
they are prohibited from being granted political asylum. They 
are three members of the Algerian police force who decided today 
to leave their country and come to Spain. For this reason they 
hijacked the Boeing 727 as it was on an internal flight from 
Oran to Annaba. The three hijackers are at the moment making 
statements to the Spanish police and after these statements have 
been made, the necessary measures will be taken. However, the 
right to request political asylum is ruled out, as the Alicante 
Civil Governor, Alfonso Calve, said: 
  [Begin Calve recording] What I said was that international 
laws and agreements exclude any possibility of political asylum. 
What is going to happen, as I said, is that following police 
investigations, they will be referred to the courts and it will 
be the judge, and the National High Court, should the judge 
decide that this case be referred to the High Court, who decides 
the future. [end recording] 
  [Flores] [passage omitted] Further conclusions made public 
by the Civil Government reveal that they have no connection with 
Islamic fundamentalist movements. [passage omitted]

to Alicante in Spain were young policemen in general security 
working in Tindouf. 
  The statement pointed out that these policemen, who were 
employed less than two years ago, had been in an illegal 
administrative condition for 10 days. As a consequence, the 
statement added, they were considered dismissed.

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 17 
February publishes on pages 1, 2, and 7 a 4,500-word report on a 
seminar organized by the newspapers AL-JUMHURIYAH and AL-MASA' 
to gather 1 million signatures from ministers, officials, 
prominent figures, and citizens for a statement condemning 
terrorism. The same report is continued in the 18 February 
issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH on page 4 in another 3,000-word report. 
The moderator of the seminar is Samir Rajab, chairman of the 
board of the al-Tahrir Publishing House and chief editor of MAYU 
and AL-MASA'. The topic of the seminar is "the role of the 
masses in confronting terrorism" and the title is "The Seminar 
To Define the Course and Gather Forces." 
  Participating in the seminar were Culture Minister Faruq 
Husni; Ahmad al-'Amawi, minister of manpower and employment; 
Cairo University President Mufid Shihab; Dr. Abu-al-Wafa 
al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for Sufist Ways; Dr. 
Milad Hanna, writer and lecturer in national and international 
fora; Mu'tasim Rashid, representative from the Popular Committee 
for Confronting Terrorism; Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head of the 
research center of al-Tahrir Publishing House; and many citizens 
and editors. 
  Samir Rajab opens the seminar by claiming that "the masses 
are the decisive factor in any battle. The masses have 
responded to the battle against terrorism with a great sense of 
responsibility and eagerness." Rajab then gives examples of 
popular support and help in tracking down terrorists. He 
comments: "The masses need aware and active forces to maintain 
the momentum, reorganize priorities, and activate the sense of 
preparedness and initiative." This, he claims, can only be done 
through "organized popular action." To conclude, he speculates 
on the outcome of the campaign and what it could eventually lead 
to. He then gives the floor to Dr. Fathi 'Abd-al-Fattah, head 
of the research center at the al-Tahrir Publishing House. 
  'Abd-al-Fattah proposes that five points be discussed during 
the seminar to define the nature of terrorism. These points 
appear as questions: "Does terrorism have religious basis?" 
"Does terrorism have any social and economic justifications?" 
"Does unemployment play an essential role in recruiting 
unemployed people to work for the terrorists?" "Is terrorism 
unique to Egypt and if not, how is terrorism in Egypt different 
from that elsewhere?" and last, "Is there a need to determine 
the economic expense of terrorism?" 
  Culture Minister Faruq Husni then takes the floor and 
ponders 
several questions. He asks: "Do terrorists have a definite 
strategy or do they practice terrorism for the sake of 
terrorism? The answer to this question defines the nature of the 
terrorist forces operating in Egypt." He then draws 
similarities between former Egyptian President Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir's political ideology and that of the terrorists, 
saying: In his quest to assume an international role and have a 
say in international affairs, 'Abd-al-Nasir attempted to rally 
global support for concepts such as pan-Arabism and socialism. 
"With this same logic, I believe there is an international 
force that uses terrorism to realize its objectives," he argues. 
His justification is that "these forces opted for Islam and 
employed it to their benefit," since Islam strikes a sensitive 
chord with Arabs and Egyptians. He believes it is a strong 
weapon that has the power to "condemn and defame" those who are 
not attracted by it. "In this way, the pan-Islamic current 
grows," he says, "through preaching, attraction, fear, or 
intimidation." The parallel, he believes, is clear in the 
slogans. The deteriorating economy had its effect on the state 
of the people. "Some felt frustrated and desperate, thus 
becoming an easy catch for the call that Islam is the solution," 
he explains. The slogan during 'Abd-al-Nasir's time was: 
"Pan-Arabism is the solution." 
  Husni maintains that the solution lies in "a comprehensive 
strategy for action" by all government bodies, because each 
ministry alone can do nothing. "The confrontation also needs 
imagination to create appropriate methods for dealing with it," 
he says. He expresses his "surprise that the government stands 
with its hands crossed when it has so many thinkers and 
innovators" and adds: "The solution, in my opinion, is 
organized and creative group action. The solution is also to 
learn from the experiences of confrontation that others have 
had" in Arab countries and elsewhere. 
  Manpower and Employment Minister Ahmad al-'Amawi disagrees 
with Husni. He believes that claiming that the terrorists have 
an ideology "gives them more credit than they deserve. We give 
them an effective weapon to recruit more men." He states: "The 
terrorist uses these confessions with us to raise his morale and 
that of his colleagues." The writer says he believes their 
arguments are "vague, unclear." 
  Al-'Amawi alludes to Iran as "one of the countries involved 
in promoting terrorism," providing as evidence Jordan's decision 
to decrease the number of Iranian diplomats in the embassy 
because it found evidence of Iranian involvement in terrorist 
acts in Jordan. He also believes that unemployment is not a 
reason for terrorism but a situation that terrorists exploit. 
In addition, al-'Amawi notes that the Ministries of Information 
and Culture cannot alone confront terrorism, because "the 
terrorist reads only what his leadership allows him to." 
  Al-'Amawi's solution is that "real action takes place 
through 
popular confrontation and through the life network of citizens. 
The objective of such action is to fortify youth against the 
allures of the terrorist organization." 
  Cairo University President Mufid Shihab then makes his 
remarks. He notes that "there are three concepts that need to be 
distinguished from one another: extremism, violence, and 
terrorism." He then defines each concept. He says that 
violence is not purely linked to religion, but is practiced by 
ignorant and uneducated young people who do not know any better. 
Shihab states that the "foreign factor cannot be ignored at 
all." He accuses "Afghanistan, elements residing in Pakistan, 
or Sudan, or Iran, or others." Therefore, he asserts that the 
responsibility is ours, "internally and externally" to confront 
these elements. He proposes signing "regional and group 
agreements to confront terrorism because the phenomenon is 
increasing and comes in various forms in the international 
arena." 
  In Shihab's opinion, the cure for terrorism takes place on 
two levels: The first is short term and consists of "security, 
cultural, and media confrontation"; and the "second is long term 
and its objective is to realize a greater number of social 
reforms, decrease unemployment, eliminate the slum areas, and 
improve the general standard of living." He maintains that 
Cairo University is now experimenting with applying these two 
levels among students to try and contain terrorism and change 
their way of thinking. He concludes that some change has been 
noticed among the students and recommends that such methods be 
applied nation-wide. 
  The 18 February issue of AL-JUMHURIYAH continues the report 
on page 4 by citing responses from Culture Minister Faruq Husni 
to earlier remarks. He believes that terrorism should not be 
taken lightly or simplified, because it is not manifested only 
in militant acts, but in psychological brainwashing, such as 
what is preached in sermons in mosques. He says: "I call for 
forming organized popular forces to confront terrorism. I 
demand a national committee in which all confrontation 
ministries participate." According to him, "confrontation 
ministries" are those that should be active in confronting 
terrorism, including the Ministries of Culture, Education, 
Information, and Religious Affairs, among others. 
  Minister al-'Amawi interjects by again advocating the belief 
that terrorism in Egypt should not be exaggerated because it 
exists all over the world. 
  Mu'tasim Rashid, representative of the Popular Committee for 
Confronting Terrorism, then speaks: "We stand before a real 
catastrophe, a catastrophe that we created 23 years ago and have 
put off confronting. More dangerous is the fact that we 
sometimes issue illogical resolutions that have not been studied 
well, such as the education minister's decision to ban political 
activities in universities." He informs the seminar that the 
reality is very different since the result has been that 
everyone at universities is involved in politics except for the 
National Democratic Party. He criticizes the government's 
head-in-the-sand policy and asks why "you are not allowing us, 
that is the committee that I represent, to work on all fronts." 
He claims that they do not have the freedom to operate. He 
explains: "Some decision-makers in Egypt are very good at 
sitting on the fence. They do not want to take any risks or 
lose anything they have, even if that means victimizing the 
homeland. This is more dangerous than terrorism itself." He 
recommends that the government should rescue youth from 
unemployment. "If we do not interact in serious and creative 
actions, we can kiss this country goodbye," he concludes. 
  Dr. Milad Hanna identifies himself as "a Christian Egyptian 
who leads the life of a Muslim. I have learned half of the 
Koran." He concentrates on one question: "Could antiterrorist 
social forces be employed effectively?" His answer is: "The 
government is very late and, at some stage, it played a 
countering role." He accuses the government of doing things for 
its own benefit. He then reviews the history of Islamic action 
in Egypt and how the Islamists were encouraged and discouraged 
by various governments depending on whether they were an asset 
or liability to that specific government. He advocates the use 
of "counter-engineering," which to his way of thinking consists 
of encouraging all sorts of counter-activities to Islam and 
religion. He believes that by concentrating on Islamic issues, 
the government is merely enabling the terrorists to have a 
podium and audience. By concentrating on other activities, the 
government could divert attention from Islamic subjects. He 
praises the Culture Ministry for doing just that, but he admits 
that "this, regrettably, is individual effort and action in an 
isolated island." He wonders: "Where are the efforts of the 
Ministries of Education, Awqaf, and Information?" He calls for 
concentrating on the status of women in Egypt, because by 
winning them over, "we would come half way." 
  Dr. Abu-al-Wafa al-Taftazani, head of the Higher Council for 
Sufist Ways, concludes the seminar by providing the viewpoint of 
a man of religion on terrorism. He maintains: "The Islam we see 
these individuals practicing is not the real Islam we know as 
men of religion and intellect." He draws parallels between the 
Khawarijites, the oldest religious sect of Islam who dissented 
from the mainstream religion during the early days of Islam, and 
the modern-day terrorists. Both explain Islam in ways suiting 
their objectives. He notes: "We need a comprehensive cultural 
movement to evaluate extremism and return the extremists to the 
correct course of Islam. This is the first step to uprooting 
terrorism and the terrorists."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 22 February 
publishes on page 9 an approximately 2,500-word article by 
Islamist writer Fahmi Huwaydi in which he discusses the 
differences between the Algerian and Egyptian confrontations 
between the government and the Islamists. 
  After noting some similarities between the situations of the 
two countries, the writer determines that "there are many 
differences between the two cases, both at the general social 
level and at the level of the confrontation itself." On the 
social level, Huwaydi says that, unlike Egyptians, the people of 
Algeria are generally inclined to extremism, largely mobilized 
against the government, and lack social harmony. And unlike 
Egypt, Algeria has a different political experience, a weaker 
central authority, and an Army that is the main player in the 
country's politics. 
  Turning to differences in the nature of the current clash in 
both countries, Huwaydi notes first that unlike the Islamic 
movement in Egypt, Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], 
established in 1989, has little political experience. The 
60-year experience of the Islamic movement in Egypt, he writes, 
"has reflected on its political language and positive attitude 
toward the issue of democracy. Its cadres have been active in 
all fields and are occupying important positions in society's 
institutions." 
  Huwaydi then maintains that the parties involved in the 
conflict in Algeria are different from those in Egypt. He says 
that while the clash against the government in Algeria involves 
many forces and sectors, with the Islamists only at the 
forefront, "the clash in Egypt is not as vague. It has become 
clear so far that the clash is between the government and some 
Islamic elements; no other sectors of society are involved." 
  The writer adds: "The Islamist group confronting the 
government in Algeria is primarily the FIS, which is the biggest 
Islamic faction in the country. But the clash in Egypt involves 
marginal factions in the Islamic movement, not the major faction 
represented by the Muslim Brotherhood. This means that while 
the biggest Islamic bloc is the main party to the clash in 
Algeria, the biggest Islamic bloc in Egypt is outside the 
confrontation. No matter where the Muslim Brotherhood stands in 
the line of political opposition, it is certainly not party to 
the armed violence in the country." 
  He says: "It is astonishing that some of the media trumpets 
in Egypt insist on expanding the scope of confrontation between 
the Islamic movement and the government by insisting on 
abolishing any differences between the various [Islamic] 
factions and branding them all with terrorism and extremism." 
  Huwaydi says the issue at the center of the confrontation is 
also different in the two cases: While the confrontation in 
Algeria is mainly a struggle for power, "the clash in Egypt is a 
series of settling scores and reactions, and power is not its 
main objective. The evidence is that the assassination of former 
President al-Sadat was directed against him personally. The 
whole government was around him, and it was easy for the 
culprits, if they really wanted to take over power, to take 
advantage of the situation and achieve their purposes in one way 
or another, but this did not happen." 
  Finally, the writer maintains that the struggle in Algeria 
essentially revolves around the country's identity and 
inclinations, particularly its position toward the sensitive 
issues of Arabism and Islam. He notes that a powerful trend in 
the government adopts a negative attitude toward the two issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with former al-Shawqiyun leader 'Adil </F>
'Abd-al-Baqi, alias Abu-'Abd-al-Rahman, by Ahmad Musa; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Musa] I sat opposite a well-built, clean-shaven man 
in a "pink" outfit. I asked him to speak honestly, which he 
promised to do. I inquired about his background. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] My name is 'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi. I was 
born on 9 April 1961 in al-Fayyum, one of eight children, to an 
ordinary family. My father is a government employee, my mother 
does not work. We are a religious family that observes the 
rites and prays regularly. I did very well in school and every 
year I received various honors from the governor and other 
officials. 
  [Musa] How did your links with the extremists in your town 
begin? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] In late 1977, I frequently went to the club 
and the nearby mosque, whose imam was Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 
The very first time I entered the mosque I was given a buoyant 
reception by 'Abd-al-Rahman's followers, who treated me like one 
of their own. One of them was 'Imad Khalifah, a student at the 
al-Haram Physical Education Institute. I grew attached to the 
mosque and its imam. 
  Once when Khalifah was back in town from Cairo he invited me 
to go to Cairo with him and meet some of his colleagues who he 
said "are a real embodiment of true religion." 
  I went with him to Fatimah al-Zahra' Mosque in al-Sahil in 
Shubra [in Cairo] where I was welcomed with enthusiasm similar 
to that displayed in al-Fayyum. Among those who welcomed me 
were Muhammad al-Aswani, Khamis Muslim, 'Isam al-Qamari--the 
three who staged the big escape from Turah prison in 1988 and 
were later killed in clashes with police--and Salah 
'Abd-al-Basir. My extremist schooling began with them. I 
started by reading the "Four Terms" book by Abu-al-A'la 
al-Mawdudi, which taught me four new concepts about government, 
godliness, worship, and religion. 
  A second book was "New Rules of Propagation" by Ibn-Rajab 
al-Hambali. This one included ideas about religious licenses, 
sanctions for killing and theft, and rulings about apostasy. 
  A third book was "Milestones" by Sayyid Qutb, who concludes 
that all secular governments are atheistic and must be 
overthrown. 
  At that time my ideas on change took shape. What completely 
made up my mind was the 28th volume of "The Doctrine of Jihad" 
by Ibn Taymiyah. The 600-page volume was summarized by Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Salam in a 54-page book entitled "The Missing Rite." 
The group's Shura Council concluded that fighting the regime 
should be our sole occupation. I left school because we ruled 
that teaching is a sin and those who engage in that profession 
are atheists who know nothing about religion. Back home I told 
my family that they were all atheists and left the house, never 
to see them again. This was in 1980. 
  [Musa] What was your specific mission when you set up the 
organization? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] I conveyed the information and ideas I had to 
other groups, particularly because I am a tactful and convincing 
speaker. It occurred to me to call for burning down movie 
theaters and shops. Our first sabotage operation was against 
the 'Abd-al-Hamid movie theater in al-Fayyum. We burned it down 
when it was showing the film "Islam al-Masih" ["Christ's 
Conversion to Islam"]. We burned it again after it was 
renovated and destroyed many other shops. 
  With the growing number of operations, the security 
apparatus 
started to summon me and the group working with me, 18 members 
at first. At that time the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' incidents 
occurred and were followed by the late President Anwar 
al-Sadat's decision to place 1,553 persons under custody. My 
name was 81st on the list and I was the youngest one, 20 years 
old. I went to jail with 'Imad Khalifah. Al-Sadat was 
assassinated in 40 days. We rejoiced that the head of the 
regime had fallen. Eighteen persons of Yusuf al-Badri's group 
were jailed. Among them were Shawqi al-Shaykh, a student at 
Hulwan Technological Institute; Rafi' Mustafa Sayyid, who is now 
wounded in Pishawar; and 'Abdallah al-Samawi. I spent 14 months 
in the same room with Shawqi and al-Samawi. We spent our time 
reading and isolated ourselves from the rest of the inmates, who 
had no specific orientation at the time. The three of us even 
used to perform our prayers alone. 
  I agreed with Shawqi to establish a group under our 
leadership. He was released four months before me but was 
rearrested for harboring a fugitive from Cairo. When I was 
released from jail, I formed the first group of this 
organization. It included Kamal Tawfiq, "the present leader"; 
al-Sayyid Khalid Mahmud, sentenced to 10 years in the case of 
the al-Zaytun jeweler shop robbery and the assassination of 
Lieutenant Colonel 'Ala' al-Barrawi of the State Security 
Detectives; Ahmad al-Khawli, a suspect in the case against 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman; and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im. The number of 
members reached 25. 
  Al-Khawli asked me to leave al-Fayyum for al-'Arish, which 
was a new area. He succeeded in convincing a large number, who 
were arrested as soon as they arrived in al-'Arish. I rented a 
flat. I had &pound;4,000 that I had taken from my mother to trade 
chickens. I had spent the money on my colleagues after two 
months. 
  [Musa] Where did you obtain the funds for your group 
members? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regrettably, the idea of sanctioning 
[al-istihlal] was first introduced by 'Abdallah al-Samawi, alias 
Tahah. Our robberies were first confined to bicycles and 
motorcycles despite the small amount of money. But they helped 
provide food and clothing. 
  When Shawqi left prison, I visited him in his Sinaru 
al-Qibliyah village. He was in very bad psychological 
condition. We agreed not to go to the mosques and perform the 
Friday prayers with only our group. We relied on the 
"Al-Tawhid" group book by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-'Abd-al-Wahhab. 
We centered our activities in the villages of Kahk al-Qibliyah, 
Kahk al-Bahriyah, and al-Rashidiyah. 
  We extended our thefts to various governorates, including 
Cairo, Bani Suwayf, and al-Fayyum. The robbery of motorcycles 
spread during this period, and al-Shawqiyun was responsible for 
all the thefts that occurred between 1983 and 1984. We also 
carried out highway robberies and seized passengers' money. 
  'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was acquitted in the al-Jihad case in 
early 1984. He returned to al-Fayyum as a spiritual leader and 
became a larger-than-life figure. Some 500 members joined our 
group. It was proposed that we work under the leadership of 
'Umar or just use his name. The group was divided and was 
vehemently attacked by 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 'Abd-al-Rahman has 
a vicious tongue, is good speaker, and a polygamist. We closed 
down the Markaz Ibshaway and banned 'Umar and al-Samawi from 
entering. The area was free for our group. I started to visit 
villages and hamlets from Naja' Hammadi in the south to Shaykh 
Zuwayd in the north and Matruh in the west. This caused problems 
with the security services because I recruited thousands of 
youths. Then the burning of cars and clubs occurred. Later, the 
"Hesitation and Confirmation" group was seized and I, as its 
leader, was imprisoned for six months. After I was released, I 
asked Shawqi al-Shaykh to rejoin our group as agreed in 
Abu-Za'bal. 
  [Musa] Who were your recruits? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Those who actually carried out the orders 
given to them. My role was to overcome whatever reservations 
they may have had. 
  [Musa] What were the reasons underlying the organization's 
specialization, as compared to other radical organizations, in 
robbing jewelry shops? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] With the increase in the number of members 
and 
the costs involved, we thought of robbing jewelry shops, 
including that of the "three brothers" in al-Zaytun, "Mishmish" 
in al-Matariyah, "al-Batul" in al-Khusus, and "Hakim" in 'Ayn 
Shams. Those were some of the fiercest operations carried out by 
groups from al-Shaqiyun and included 'Ali 'Abd-al-Wahhab, 
Ramadan Mustafa, Hilal Shafi', Khalid 'Abd-al-Hamid Imam, 'Ali 
Fayid Mayhub, Muhammad Ahmad Farghali, and Kamal 'Abdallah. 
Some of these have been sentenced to death and executed and 
others were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment. They 
collected huge amounts of gold jewelry in these incidents, which 
were accurately planned by specific groups. 
  [Musa] It is obvious that when the members of your group 
fell 
no further robberies were committed. Are there elements around 
that can perform these special tasks? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] It is certain that al-Shawqiyun was solely 
responsible for these tasks; they had no partners from other 
organizations. The leaders' fall does not mean the termination 
of these operations. But the security agencies are tightening 
their control on jewelry shops in all cities and governorates. 
This makes the success of these operations uncertain. 
Moreover, there are no leaders among the remnants of 
al-Shawqiyun. They are currently in the making. 
  [Musa] What about the other organizations: The Vanguards of 
Conquest, al-Jihad, Those Delivered From Fire, and Repudiation 
and Renunciation, and their leading cadres? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] I did not join the Islamic Group because I 
detest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman personally. The operations they 
carry out, particularly in Upper Egypt, are part of their public 
actions. They often claim responsibility for the crimes they 
commit. The examples are numerous. I believe that the group 
has weakened considerably after the security agencies' 
successive blows to their leading cadres, who are actually 
responsible for running the criminal operations. I recall that 
Tharwat Hajjaj was one of the most reliable cadres in his 
organization because he was a good thinker. He was rivaled only 
by Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani and Mamduh Yusuf, both accused of 
assassinating late People's Assembly Speaker Rif'at al-Mahjub. 
  [Musa] What about other elements? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Muhammad al-Najjar, the third defendant in 
the 
al-Mahjub case, is a Maxton Fort [a liquid amphetamine] addict. 
Traces of injections are all over his body. He joined the group 
to be beside 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 
  Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli is living off the reputation of 
his brother Khalid, who killed the late president. 
  'Izzat al-Salamuni, implicated in the al-Mahjub case, has no 
vision of religion or organizational action. 
  'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman: The press and the security turned him 
into a star. He is talkative and sharp-tongued. After raiding 
the Asyut Security Directorate's building and killing 23 
officers and soldiers on 8 October 1981, 'Abd-al-Rahman ordered 
members of the organization to fast in the prison for 60 days to 
atone for their failure to consult with him over the operation. 
(This is mentioned for the first time.) 
  Tal'at Yasin Hammam: One of the most important fugitives. 
He is actually responsible for carrying out criminal 
operations. He conveys messages to certain elements to 
accomplish certain objectives. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, alias Abu-Talal al-Qasimi: Good for 
talking and sending leaflets from abroad, but he is unable to 
lead the group. 
  The Vanguards of Conquest: This organization is more 
dangerous and more active. The advanced equipment seized from 
its members indicates this. The organization adopts an 
intricate system in its operations and its members receive 
thorough training in the apartments they rent; they know how to 
use coded messages, and most of those who now join the group had 
travelled to Afghanistan with "al-Jihad, the Islamic Group, or 
Notification and Propagation." The organization focuses on 
selecting new members who have not been monitored by the 
security services and have no identity cards. These members, 
therefore, manage to enter ports and airports normally. The 
organization's members remain under observation and 
psychological training until they themselves ask for 
assignments. They often carry out crimes that draw widescale 
reaction, like the attempts on the lives of Prime Minister Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi and Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. Through such 
crimes they seek to show that the regime is impotent, which is 
more dangerous than guns. 
  Repudiation and Renunciation: The most dangerous criminal 
mentality on the scene was that of Shukri Mustafa. The 
organization has not disappeared; it is only dormant. After the 
Shaykh al-Dhahabi incident and the murder of Shukri Mustafa, 
Muhammad al-Amin 'Abd-al-Fattah assumed its leadership. He 
travels between several countries. A split took place and Dr. 
Wahid Abu-Salman was put in charge of the organization. 
  Those Delivered From Fire: Their leader is Amin 'Abdallah, 
not Yusri 'Abd-al-Mun'im or Majdi al-Safti. Amin's mission is 
to give lessons to the organization's members, who include 'Adil 
Musa 'Atiyah and 'Abdallah Abu-al-'Ula. As regards Muhammad 
Qasim 'Abd-al-Qawi, who was "killed at the Santaris battle," he 
only knew a collection of short Koranic verses. 
  Al-Jihad: Muhammad al-Aswani and his brother Tariq, Khamis 
Musallam, Muhammad Sa'd, Hasan al-Hillawi, and 'Abbud al-Zumur 
are its leaders. Under the slogan "the end justifies the 
means," members of the organization use their wives to carry 
weapons and ammunition. Al-Jihad carries out secret 
organizational actions; this was the principle of the unified 
organization before the 1981 events. 
  Al-Shawqiyun: A group of thieves and robbers; they are no 
different from the other groups although their armed operations 
are violent and vicious. They do not mind killing scores of 
citizens to ensure the success of their operations. The 
organization has reached a level where every group assigns 
itself some task, such as assassination or armed robbery. The 
crimes are not organized because the organization has so many 
members with different thoughts. 
  [Musa] What is your explanation of the competition among 
terrorist groups to perform the largest number of operations? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] What the so-called Islamic Group is 
doing--striking here and there--has no noticeable effect. Their 
intention is to create a state of confusion and panic. As for 
the Islamic Jihad, their operations are intentional and have a 
definite objective. The Vanguards of Conquest's problem is 
choosing a target and finding the way and means to attack it. 
Despite the different sizes of the operations, their objectives 
are the same: to embarrass and pressure the government. 
  [Musa] You were responsible for one of the terrorist groups 
and know the size of its expenditures. Where does the funding 
for these groups come from? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] The al-Shawqiyun and Repudiation and 
Renunciation groups did not get any funding from abroad. They 
relied on robbery, theft, and contributions. The others 
definitely have foreign contacts and receive funding from 
numerous countries. I was present one day when a famous lawyer 
handed over 250,000 Egyptian pounds that he had obtained from 
alms taxes. The objective was to spend this money on the needs 
of the organization. There was more than the amount we saw. 
There are people abroad whose responsibility is to gather funds 
and send them over. In one of the seminars he held in al-Salam 
Mosque in New York, 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman gathered $200,000 in 
one day. Part of these funds were transferred by various means 
to his aides in Egypt. 
  [Musa] This leads us to wonder about the leaders of the 
terrorist groups who have fled abroad and the extent of their 
influence on their bases in Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Over 70 percent of the incidents in Egypt 
take 
place upon instructions from abroad. As proof, we note what has 
been reported about instructions issued by al-Zawahiri, Tal'at 
Qasim, and Makkawi to assassinate the prime minister and the 
ministers of interior and information. 
  [Musa] Why has al-Fayyum been transformed from a hotbed to a 
large ambush? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Religious activities in al-Fayyum decreased 
and the security grip was tightened on the governorate and on 
criminal hotbeds, thus weakening the presence of these currents 
and toppling their leaders. However, fears still exist. There 
are three fugitives in an Asian country who have contacts with 
some of their aides. This requires much attention and awareness. 
  [Musa] Is there a similarity between the type of armed 
operations taking place in Egypt and Algeria? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] There are similarities between the terrorist 
operations in both countries. No one can deny this similarity 
because groups from both countries receive their training in 
Afghanistan and fight side by side inside the same camps. 
  [Musa] Where do the members of these gangs get their 
weapons? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] You do not need any evidence to know this. 
Most houses in Upper Egypt have weapons. As long as there is 
money one can buy weapons anywhere. It is difficult to stop 
groups from obtaining automatic weapons and machine guns. 
However, the numbers that they have are not as large as some 
people imagine. This is evident in the operations that are 
being carried out and the weapons that are being used. 
  [Musa] Describe for us the secrets of the organizations, 
such 
as marriages and divorces? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Many things that go against Islamic teachings 
are practiced inside these groups. There are many women who get 
married while still married to their first husbands. We once 
heard that one of the members of the organization met a married 
woman and had a relationship with her after he ordered her to 
leave her infidel husband and marry him. They also had a 
daughter together. However, the organization condemned him as an 
infidel and forced her to divorce him and get married to another 
member without any contractual agreement. After some time she 
divorced him again. This is how marriages take place among the 
members of these organizations. We heard reports about a rich 
man in Port Said who would pay &pound;1,000 to each member who 
joins the group and provide them with an apartment. This amir 
married his sister off to a member of the organization without 
having the couple sign a single sheet of paper. How can you 
describe such a marriage? Does Islamic shari'ah sanction these 
satanic abominations that are committed by those who claim to 
have come to deliver the people from destruction? 
  [Musa] What about your own marriage? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] I got married to the sister of 'Abdallah 
al-Samawi. When I asked for her hand in marriage, I offered him 
only &pound;500. We were married within the week in a small bare 
room. In two years we had two children, 'Abd-al-Rahman and 
Hasna'. My wife traveled with me on my trips around the 
governorates. When my differences with the organization 
started, she left me and joined my colleagues. This was the 
beginning of our troubles. 
  I asked Shawqi to discuss the issue of sanctioning robbery. 
He told me that the issue was out of his hands, especially 
because there were over 5,000 people working for the 
organization and reaping the yield. He would not be able to 
inform them all. Suddenly, one day, Shawqi al-Shaykh, Sayyid 
Khalid, and Kamal 'Abd-al-Ilah came to see me. They were 
carrying automatic weapons. They asked me to leave al-Fayyum 
and never come back. After some time, clashes took place with 
the police and Shawqi was killed. 
  [Musa] How did the assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad 
'Ala' al-Barrawi, an officer in the state security in al-Fayyum, 
take place? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] I was not in al-Fayyum at that time. The 
crime upset me a great deal although I hated the officer and 
everyone who was related to the regime. However, he helped me a 
great deal with things unrelated to his work; this made me like 
him. His assassination was a major turning point in my 
relationship with the members of the organization and their 
crimes. 
  [Musa] Why have you left your two children in this terrible 
swamp and not looked after them? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Deep in my heart, I will resort to any power, 
including the devil himself, to rescue my children from this 
swamp as soon as my financial and psychological situation is 
sorted out. I have suffered much brainwashing for 17 long years. 
These 17 years have had a great effect on me; I had to stop my 
studies and am now unemployed with no identity. My whole future 
has been wasted as a result of destructive concepts. I left 
these groups and now haven't a single penny in my pocket, 
despite the fact that I used to spend around &pound;10,000 to 
15,000 a week on these groups. Nevertheless, I am still 
convinced that these groups are thieves, robbers, and criminals. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Recently the security agencies dealt major 
blows to these groups. What is your view of this confrontation 
and the role of the remaining organs? 
  [Musa] The current confrontation indicates that the security 
agencies have modernized their methods. The terrorists 
currently are reacting to police attacks--the opposite of the 
situation in previous years. The police should continue to take 
the initiative to deny these groups the opportunity to commit 
crimes that confuse the concerned parties. I regret that the 
other ministries have not played the necessary role in the 
confrontation. Sermons inside mosques do not persuade. There 
must be urgent alternatives and solutions. The government is 
currently exerting efforts to partially solve the unemployment 
problem. The police agencies are banning these groups to 
isolate them from society. These measures will limit terrorist 
activities. I call on the media organs to refrain from 
publishing dialogues with terrorist leaders. The interview 
published in a certain newspaper with terrorist Tal'at Fu'ad 
Qasim is considered a code that raises the morale of the 
terrorists inside Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Do jails serve as sites to spawn terrorism 
and 
pass orders? 
  [Musa] True, jails in the past few years served as spawning 
sites for terrorism. Any convict who was jailed on charges of 
robbery would later leave prison an effective member of these 
groups. Most current leaders of these groups met in jail and 
organized their plans and groups inside jails. The jail 
authorities now separate prisoners and limit mingling. Orders 
are passed from prisoners to visiting women. Orders might be 
passed through certain signals or words that represent a code 
and passed to another party outside the prison to be carried out. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Lists of figures who are targets for 
assassination are usually discovered in terrorist dens. How do 
you prepare these lists and who is in charge of choosing the 
targets? 
  [Musa] In principle, every organization has its own rules 
about the targets it selects. Customarily, the groups seek to 
kill officials and police officers connected with the regime 
although terrorists generally dislike reporters because they 
believe the media are responsible for guiding and consolidating 
the regime. 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] But certain officers are constantly targeted? 
  [Musa] Yes, especially those who deal with prisoners in 
political cases.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Dawud from Damietta] </F>
  [Excerpt] Mustafah al-Badawayhi, head of the Damietta 
prosecution office, has ordered that the mayor of Damietta, a 
member of the city council, and 15 other extremists be put in 
prison for 15 days pending investigations. They were charged 
with forming a secret organization with the objective of 
toppling the government by using the position of the mayor 
supported by a number of other members of the council who belong 
to the Labor Party to conduct secret activities and to use the 
summer resort of Ra's al-Barr [name as published, presumably 
Ra's al-Bahr], which is now empty, for their organization's 
training, lectures, and other instruction. 
  The security men noticed some suspect activities by some 
youths known for their extremist tendencies. By observing them, 
it became evident that they were forming a secret organization 
and that the mayor was abusing his office to support the 
organization. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by al-Sa'id al-Shatti from Damietta] </F>
  [Text] Security Department interrogations of the members of 
the terrorist organization led by Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, 
ophthalmologist and chairman of the Damietta City Council, have 
revealed the existence of similar groups in many other 
governorates. These groups rely principally on the members of 
local councils affiliated with the Socialist Labor Party [SLP]. 
Some of the suspects have confessed, implicating their 
colleagues in other governorates. 
  The security departments will soon announce that they have 
uncovered new terrorist organizations in several governorates. 
  Dr. 'Ali al-Day said that as chairman of the City Council, 
he 
approved a Ramadan soccer tournament in the Ra's al-Barr sea 
resort at the request of Mustafa Subayhah, chairman of the City 
Council's Youth and Sports Committee. He denied that the team 
members were trained in karate or kung fu. 
  Investigations have shown that the chairman of the City 
Council, assisted by several SLP members, exploited the council 
and his own position to implement suspect plans and disseminate 
ideas calling for the regime's overthrow. 
  The suspects are: Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, ophthalmologist and 
chairman of the City Council; Ashraf Zakariya 'Ubayd, deputy 
City Council chairman and decorator; Muhammad Muhammad al-Jundi, 
furniture dealer; Hasan al-Sayyid al-Mursi, optician; 
'Abd-al-Hadi al-Nahhas, freelance accountant; Hamdi 'Isa, 
agronomist; Husayn Husayn 'Ukashah, freelance accountant; 
al-Sa'id Muhammad Musa, decorator; Ahmad Gharib Abu-Diyal, 
vocational school student; Karim 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 
Jamal 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 'Adduh 'Ali Abu-Mahdi, 
carpenter; decorators Khamis Ibrahim and Muhammad Ibrahim; and 
furniture makers Ashraf Muhammad Basha, 'Abduh Abu-al-'Aynayn, 
and Mahmud al-Bih. 
  Mustafa al-Badawayhi, director of Damietta's Prosecution 
Office, remanded them for 15 days for interrogation on a charge 
of establishing an organization seeking to overthrow the 
government. 
  He also instructed that Damietta Public Attorney Counselor 
Ahmad al-'Izabi to supervise the arrest of the following eight 
suspects: Mustafa Subayhah, City Council member; Wa'il 
Subayhah, secondary school student; Salamah al-'Iraqi; City 
Council member and furniture dealer; Salamah al-Bahawan, 
agronomist and City Council member; Muhammad Isma'il al-Rawdi, 
employee; Mahmud al-Sha'rawi, furniture maker; Ibrahim Durrah, 
decorator; and Ahmad Jaddu, decorator.

  [Text] Cairo, March 4 (AFP)--Egypt's outlawed Islamic Group 
said Friday it had carried out three attacks in the past week to 
avenge the Hebron massacre of more than 50 Muslim worshippers by 
a Jewish settler. 
  The Islamic Group, known in Arabic as al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah, claimed responsibility for two attacks on banks 
and the murder of a police officer, according to a statement 
sent to AFP. 
  "These operations are part of the escalation we decided on 
to 
avenge the martyrs of Abraham Mosque" in Hebron, the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Jewish settler shot dead 52 
Palestinian worshippers last Friday, it said. 
  The statement claimed responsibility for the late Thursday 
explosion at the Egyptian-American Bank in Cairo, as well as an 
attack on Tuesday against Misr Bank in Abu Tij and the killing 
of a police officer in Badari. 
  Both Abu Tij and Badari are in the southern region of Asyut, 
a Muslim militant stronghold. 
  The group said it carried out the attacks after the banks 
closed "in order not to endanger human lives." 
  It renewed its February 8 call to tourists and foreign 
investors to leave Egypt and to Egyptian bank customers to close 
their accounts. "If these (attacks) are not enough for you, 
there will be others," it said. 
  Since the warning there have been six attacks against banks 
-- five in Cairo and one in Asyut -- but there have been no 
casualties.

<F P=106> [By 'Ali Dawud] </F>
  [Excerpt] Damietta--The state security intelligence service 
in Damietta has uncovered a dangerous terrorist organization 
inside Tanta Prison led by Mahmud Muhammad Shu'ayb, 
brother-in-law of terrorist Karam Zuhdi. Both of them were 
sentenced for the 1981 events and the assassination of the late 
President Anwar al-Sadat. 
  Organization leader Shu'ayb is doing a life sentence in 
Tanta 
Prison after being convicted of involvement in the 1981 events 
and 40 terrorist acts in Asyut. Last March he began to contact 
a group of his colleagues and other elements from inside the 
prison in order to form an organization to be tasked with 
assassinating a number of public figures, with special emphasis 
on police officers and men. Ramadan Hasan Salih, Muntasir Ahmad 
Husayn, and Khalid Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Rahman, all of them from 
Asyut, helped him to set up the organization together with 
Mahmud Mustafa Hasaballah from al-Buhayrah, who is a doctor at 
the general hospital in Fuwah. 
  The intelligence service discovered all the arrangements 
made 
by the terrorist organization and monitored the instructions 
sent from the prison to the various members in a number of 
governorates. All the arrested defendants were handed over to 
the public prosecution office for interrogation. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah, 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im, and </F>
Hisham Fu'ad] 
  [Excerpt] AL-'ARABI has learned that two of those charged 
with attempting to assassinate President Mubarak by bombing Sidi 
Barrani airport and the presidential guest house in Marsa Matruh 
were executed by a firing squad Monday. The families of the two 
were notified to receive the bodies last Thursday. On 17 
February, the military court sentenced to death three people: 
Midhat al-Tahhawi, Hamadah Lutfi, and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id 
Salih (fugitive). The court also sentenced Fathi Muhammad 
Khattab, Khalid Faraj, and Khalid Rashad to 10 years in prison. 
[see item NC1802112494 in previous Terrorism Report] 
  Observers have noted that the indictment and trial were 
carried out quickly, with the whole case taking no more than one 
month. It all began when security services, in an inspection 
campaign in Abu Za'bal in mid-January, accidentally arrested one 
of the suspects. After that, the military prosecution prepared 
the indictment and the military court began its hearings on 30 
January. Three court sessions were held in 10 days, and 
families of the suspects were not allowed to contact their sons 
or appoint lawyers to defend them. The court appointed the 
defense lawyers. 
  Najar al-'Arabi, secretary of the Egyptian Human Rights 
Organization, commented on the military court ruling by saying: 
The trial was extremely hasty, and the defense could not 
perform its duty. The new executions only exacerbate the 
phenomenon of political executions; law organizations have 
repeatedly called for halting them and for the defendants to be 
allowed to appear before civilian judges. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ahmedabad, January 23--The landing of 300 more 
consignments containing RDX and arms and ammunition on the south 
Gujarat seacoast between February 1 and 7 [1993] has come to 
light. This was revealed during the interrogation of the three 
drivers of Ijoo Sheikh alias Irralu Abdul Hamid Sheikh, on 
Friday. 
  Ijoo had supervised the landing of 100 consignments at Fansa 
village near Umbergaon in Bulsar district last year. 
  With this the total number of consignments of explosives, 
arms and ammunition that had landed on the south Gujarat 
seacoast has risen to 400. As many as 120 consignments had 
landed at Porbandar seacoast. Four more persons, who had carried 
out the loading and unloading of the consignments at the 
instance of Ijoo were nabbed from Kanaria village in Bulsar 
taluka on Friday evening. Bhikha Bhimji, one of the three 
drivers of Ijoo, is reported to have confessed to the police 
during the interrogation that besides the landing of 100 
consignments near Fansa village at Umbergaon, between January 17 
to 21, as many as 300 consignments of different sizes had landed 
between February 1 to 7 at Jaibordi and Kanaria villages in 
Umbergaon. Later all 300 consignments were sent to Bombay by the 
two landing agents of Dawood Ibrahim and distributed. 
  The evidence given by Bhikha Bhimji, in connection with the 
landings of more consignments was further corroborated by Bhima 
Vansa and Manilal Patel. The three drivers also revealed that 
Dawood Ibrahim was constantly in touch with Ijoo in connection 
with the transportation of the consignments. 
  This revelation has provided a clue to the police to believe 
that the highest number of consignments containing explosives 
and arms had landed on the south Gujarat seacoast. The police 
also suspects that some of these consignments might contain 
silver, gold and even contraband goods. 
  Further interrogation of the culprits revealed that Ijoo had 
accompanied Bhikha, Bhima and Manilal, right up to Bombay city. 
However, the identity of the places where these consignments 
were unloaded in Bombay were not disclosed to the three drivers 
by Ijoo. A team of experts from Bombay city, who had examined 
the gunny bags, seized by the police from Tatawadi area in Fansa 
village, in the laboratory confirmed that the RDX was packed in 
these gunny bags. Examination of the elements of explosives 
present in the gunny bags also indicated that the RDX must have 
been in cake form at the time of unloading of the consignments. 
  In a related development the Bulsar customs department has 
found that Ijoo, who is wanted by the police in the RDX 
smuggling, has smuggled silver worth Rs117 crores into Gujarat 
since 1987. Acting on a tip-off customs officials arrested four 
of Ijoo's drivers on Thursday. They were taken to a place that 
has been kept a closely-guarded secret for interrogation. It 
was during the course of the interrogation that the accused's 
involvement in smuggling of silver came to light. 
  The assistant customs collector, Mr Ajay Dikshi said an 
offence had been registered on Thursday against Ijoo under the 
provisions of the Customs Act as well as Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act (FERA). Mr Dikshit said that Ijoo had so far 
carried out 62 landings of silver and used more than 15 trucks 
for the purpose. 
  The Bulsar police will seek the help of its counterpart in 
Bombay in finding out the links of the culprits with the other 
accused involved in the smuggling activities. 
  Meanwhile, it is learned that Ijoo was let off by the police 
last May. Ijoo, who was not traceable for some time after the 
dastardly Bombay blasts was kept in a police station, 
questioned, but was allowed to leave after 24 hours on May 15, 
1993. 
  According to the assistant collector of customs at Bulsar, 
Mr 
Ajay Dixit, Ijoo had given an undertaking to make himself 
available for inquiries but has been at large.

  [Text] Delhi police have arrested six persons and foiled a 
well-planned conspiracy for creating widespread disturbances in 
India by Pakistan-trained militants. Briefing newsmen in New 
Delhi today, the city police commissioner, Mr. N.B. Kaushal, 
disclosed that they had planned to create disturbances, attack 
religious places, and use poison. He said it is for the first 
time that Pakistan used its own nationals for such operations 
who are trained and experienced in guerrilla warfare and 
insurgency. Sixteen kg of explosives, detonators, hand 
grenades, and Pakistani passports were seized from the arrested 
persons who belong to the Islamic Inqilabi Mahaz [Revolutionary 
Front]. Two sets of floppies were also seized from the 
terrorists, who were planning to prepare a computer. Cases 
against them have been registered, and they were remanded to 
police custody.

Attacked in Florence"] 
  [Text] Nicosia, 27 Feb (ANSA) -- The Iranian National 
Resistance Council said that one of its members in Florence 
escaped an assassination attempt yesterday. 
  In a statement to ANSA's Nicosia bureau, the group said that 
"two terrorists sent by the Khomeyni regime" chased one of their 
members in a car. The two, arrested by Tuscan police, were 
identified by the opposition group as Ayoub Fayoui and Iraj 
Oaderi [names as received]. 
  Last March, an opposition leader Mohammed Hossein Naghdidel 
[name as received] was assassinated in Rome.

  [Excerpts] The talks held by Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid al-Faysal in Tehran have not 
yielded the results Iraq sought to achieve; namely, breaking its 
regional and international isolation. [passage omitted on trade

  Sources further said that the Iraqi official suggested 
"sacrificing" the leaders of the opposition organization of 
Mojahedin-e Khalq if Iran agrees to resume trade operations. 
Iranian officials, who were interested several months ago in 
bringing the leaders of Mojahedin-e Khalq under control, 
rejected the tempting Iraqi offer because they believe the U.S. 
Administration is looking for "excuses to harass Iran."

  [Text] A huge explosion shook the al-Waziriyah district in 
the center of the capital, Baghdad, yesterday, four days after 
three big explosions occurred in Karkuk. Iraqi opposition 
sources said the explosion yesterday took place outside the 
entrance of al-Mustansariyah University. They said the 
explosion targeted a big mural, which had a picture of tyrant 
Saddam Husayn, mounted outside the entrance to the university. 
Security forces rushed to the scene of the crime and the main 
entrance to the university was closed off.

<F P=106> [See SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in the front of this Terrorism </F>
Report for TV coverage of this incident] 
  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1540 GMT on 25 February carries live interviews with Ministers 
Sarid and Shahal who formulated the announcement issued by the 
government at the end of its special meeting today. 
  In the course of his interview, Minister Sarid expresses his 
belief that an inquiry commission should be set up, as proposed 
in the cabinet meeting, stressing though that "there is no doubt 
that today's murder was carried out by a single individual who 
acted alone. He was the only shooter." As for how he managed 
to carry out his act in the Cave of the Patriarchs unhindered by 
the Army, Sarid says: "An explanation was given by the Army. I 
believe it should be given by the Army. There was a door there 
which should have been locked, and the officer who was in charge 
of the scene at the time tried to enter the prayer hall but was 
pushed back by the crowd of worshippers who fled outside." 
Minister Sarid also emphasizes the decision by the commander of 
the Central Command, as reported to the cabinet today, on the 
curfew imposed on Jews in Hebron "who are allowed to move freely 
only in their area of residence, but, for the first time, are 
not allowed to enter the town of Hebron. As for Qiryat Arba', 
the closure means it is possible to enter and exit Qiryat Arba' 
only at a special request for permission from the IDF." 
  During his interview, Police Minister Shahal is asked 
whether 
today's incident is not the result of police's helplessness in 
enforcing the law on the settlers, specifically Kakh members. 
He responded that the police are not responsible for public 
order in the territories at all. Still, in its capacity of 
opening files against criminals, the police does so when 
evidence is collected, but "there was no concrete material" 
against this morning's murderer. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Barukh Goldstein, the man who perpetrated the 
murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs, was beaten to death, 
apparently by enraged Arab worshippers. These are the 
conclusions of a preliminary investigation carried out by the 
police investigators. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky was 
informed by the Judaea District Police that Goldstein's skull 
was crushed by blows; there were no gunshots to his body. The 
Police therefore rule out the possibility that Goldstein was 
shot or that he committed suicide, and apparently there will be 
no need to carry out an autopsy.

  [Excerpts] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq today visited the Cave 
of the Patriarchs and the Hebron area with senior IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] officers and conducted a debriefing of 
yesterday's incidents. After reaching his conclusions 
Lieutenant General Baraq convened a news conference, which was 
attended by our correspondent Karmela Menashe: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified 
correspondent] Do you have any picture of what happened inside 
these halls? 
  [Baraq] Dr. Goldstein entered early morning and apparently 
opened fire from one of the passages connecting the two prayer 
areas -- it is still unclear which passage. He opened fire at 
the group of worshippers who were praying in the Muslim hall. I 
cannot determine the facts beyond this yet. The entire issue is 
under a thorough investigation. I have no doubts that in the 
wake of this investigation the entire picture will become clear. 
This is the situation. To the best of my knowledge Dr. 
Goldstein was the only one who fired shots inside this hall. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Menashe] Chief of Staff Baraq, who held the news conference 
near the Cave of the Patriarchs, emphasized that apparently 
there should have been border policemen stationed near the Cave 
of the Patriarchs yesterday, but they were not there. [end

  [Text] According to unofficial figures 39 people were 
killed in the Cave of the Patriarchs yesterday. Fifteen 
residents were killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in 
Hebron and its environs during the riots which erupted following 
the massacre. Another four were killed in similar circumstances 
-- three in Gaza and one in Nabulus. 
  IDF spokesmen say they do not have accurate figures 
regarding 
the number of casualties in Hebron, adding that the issue is 
still being examined. 
  The number of wounded rose yesterday to more than 250 
people. 
Approximately 100 cartridge cases fired by Barukh Goldstein were 
found in the Cave of the Patriarchs' Yitzhaq Hall. 
  The security forces are preventing Qiryat Arba' residents 
from entering Hebron. They can reach Jerusalem only in military 
escorted convoys going through Bet Shemesh. Our correspondent 
Mira Amsalem reports from Hebron that car traffic in Qiryat 
Arba' is extremely limited.

  [Text] Reacting to the savage Zionist massacre, Mr. Ahmad 
Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], has said 
that there is nothing surprising in the Zionist acts of 
barbarity. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre will not be the last. 
It is a natural link in the chain of the Zionist enemy's 
actions against our Palestinian people, whose resolve to 
liberate their stolen homeland will never weaken in the face of 
the Zionist occupation and its tools of war, which are supplied 
by a U.S. Administration that cares only about its own interests. 
  The U.S. Administration's policies, now as in the past, show 
how biased it is to the Zionist enemy. This fact makes us 
certain that for Washington, Arab blood is not worth a drop of 
oil. The U.S.-sponsored rounds of negotiations over Arab 
rights, including Palestinian rights, only illustrate the 
solidity of the American-Zionist alliance, which is being joined 
by weaklings from our midst in a cheap transaction involving the 
homeland, the people, and sanctities. 
  The PFLP-GC secretary general's press statement added: The 
savagery committed by the Zionist entity against Palestinian 
worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque is a corollary of the 
negotiations over blood, dignity, and rights. It is one of the 
fruits yielded by the Gaza-Jericho accord. This gave the 
Zionist entity a short cut to its goals and helped it legitimize 
its occupation of Palestinian Arab territory. It laid the 
groundwork for the gangs of killers and settlers to vent their 
hatred and Nazism against our people, whose only weapon is 
confidence in the inevitability of their triumph over this 
barbaric invasion. 
  We can only conclude from the incidents at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque that the real killers are those who encouraged the Jews 
and stretched out their hands to the enemy, who saw that its 
interests are being met by concessions from the 'Arafat 
leadership and certain Arab regimes who are playing the role of 
broker to promote mutual recongition and a settlement that by no 
means serves Arab or Islamic interests. 
  Jibril's statement added: The customary denunciations and 
condemnations by official Arab regimes will do nothing to dress 
our people's wounds nor restore their stolen rights, at a time 
when these regimes are working on opening up to the Zionist 
enemy and to their capitals becoming playgrounds for these 
vagabonds. 
  We in the PFLP-GC are aware of the scale of the conspiracy 
and what the forces of injustice, capitulation, and concessions 
are out to achieve. We are confident, therefore, that our 
Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Muslim nation will take 
revenge on those who have bargained away sanctities, land, and 
history. 
  Our Palestinian people inside the occupied homeland and in 
the diaspora camps will never forgive the killers their deed. 
Their retribution will be great. We are a nation of martyrs 
and martyrdom and have no fear of death. This horrible massacre 
will only serve to stiffen our people's and nation's resolve and 
boost their confidence in the inevitability of victory.

  [Text] An unidentified person telephoned the Qol Yisra'el 
newsroom this morning and said he was speaking on behalf of an 
organization called Shlomtziyon-Yehuda [The Well-Being of 
Zion-Judaea]. He warned that his organization will retaliate to 
every terror attack by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or 
the Islamic Jihad with murders, in Israel or abroad, which will 
be similar to the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The man who 
will carry out the act will never be caught. He will commit 
suicide to sanctify God's name.

  [Excerpt] The territories are under full closure since this 
morning and their residents are banned from coming to work in 
Israel until further notice. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that a closure was also 
clamped on Qiryat Arba'. In practice, however, it is not being 
observed and every two hours a convoy of cars and a bus to 
Jerusalem leave Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The convoys are 
escorted by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops due to 
stone-throwing incidents in the area of Halhul. [passage omitted 
on rioting]

  [Text] The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza [CJSJSG] approves of the establishment of a 
state commission of inquiry into the Hebron killings, but at the 
same time demands that the commission check all the events in 
the six years of Arab terror. CJSJSG denounces the release of 
terrorists from prison, and opposes the proposals to seize 
weapons from Jews in the territories. Our correspondent Gil 
Litman reports that in a communique released today, CJSJSG once 
again expresses sorrow over the murders and denounces the 
killing of innocent people.

  [Excerpts] Barukh Goldstein was buried in Qiryat Arba' 
this evening after a funeral procession from Jerusalem. The 
burial site at Qiryat Arba' is temporary, and his body will be 
moved eventually to the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. Speakers 
eulogizing Goldstein praised both the man and his actions. Mark 
Weiss was at the funeral: 
  Eulogies were recited at the Shamgar funeral parlor in 
Jerusalem and at the yeshiva in Qiryat Arba', and the message at 
both venues was militant and uncompromising. Speakers praised 
the massacre as a selfless act committed on behalf of the Jewish 
people as a whole. The victims were described not as innocent 
worshippers, but as the people who stabbed innocent Jews and the 
descendants of the Hebron residents who murdered almost the 
entire Jewish population of the town in 1929. A million Arabs 
are not worth the fingernail of one Jew, said one of the 
speakers. We are all Goldstein, shouted one of the mourners at 
one stage. Again and again, the speakers denounced the 
government and the media, and above all the fact that an armed 
Palestinian police force is about to be established. All this, 
together with the fact that Dr. Goldstein had repeatedly treated 
the victims of Arab terror, combined to create a situation where 
he just couldn't take it any more. All the eulogizers said 
Goldstein should be praised as a righteous man. A few hundred 
people attended the eulogies in Jerusalem. Many hundreds more 
joined in at Qiryat Arba'. [passage omitted] 
  For many other mourners, the most radical elements among the 
settlers, the funeral was an occasion to come together and 
express solidarity. And, that was definitely the feeling of a 
community under siege. There was intense hostility toward 
journalists, and much of the talk among the crowd was of a witch 
hunt and the possibility of informers planted within the 
settlements.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) 
Sunday renewed a call on the mainstream Fatah faction of the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to renounce the Middle 
East peace process and join hands to liberate Palestine through 
armed struggle. 
  "We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and 
escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an 
open letter signed by Hamas. 
  In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the 
occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the 
peace talks or face unspecified consquences. [passage omitted] 
  "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people 
died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed 
struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to 
live with our people in peace," said the statement. 
  In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to 
the 
JORDAN TIMES, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond 
to this brotherly and national call ... to abort the 
surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men." 
  Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through 
escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its 
earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow 
Palestinians. 
  In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with 
attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel. 
  "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate 
withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not 
allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiations 
with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people," 
said the letter. 
  The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the 
intifada and carry out revenge attacks against Israeli soldiers 
and settlers and engage in fights with them. 
  "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs 
and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent 
targets wherever they may be," read the letter. 
  The letter also called for demonstrations and marches 
throughout the occupied territories. 
  It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the 
Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman -- The Fatah Liberation Movement in Hebron has 
called on the Palestinian command to immediately suspend 
negotiations with the Israeli Government at all levels until the 
settlers are removed from the occupied territories. The 
movement also announced the cancellation of the cease-fire 
between its combat groups and the forces of occupation, and 
herds of settlers and the resumption of operations against them. 
  The movement called on the strike forces to escalate the 
intifadah against the settlers and the army forces at all times 
and to consider any settler who passes in Hebron streets as a 
target for our strike forces. 
  The movement also called on national institutions and 
figures 
to halt all forms of contact with the departments of the 
military governor in Hebron, and held the Rabin government 
responsible for preparing and implementing the horrendous crime 
perpetrated by the settlers under the protection of the 
occupation forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed and Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpt] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources warned the 
secretariats of settlements belonging to the Mate Binyamin 
Regional Council [between Jerusalem and Ramallah] of terrorist 
plans to perpetrate a spectacular attack against one or more of 
the settlements there. A very high state of alert was declared 
in the Mate Binyamin settlements, and the IDF has dramatically 
beefed up its forces in the region. 
  A particularly sharp pamphlet published yesterday by the 
Palestinian command in the territories, which includes PLO 
representatives, said: "The Zionist enemy must be aware that no 
crime goes unavenged. Those who spill the blood of our people 
will not go unscathed. We will set the ground under the feet of 
the Nazi occupiers on fire." 
  The Palestinian leadership in the territories has renewed 
the 
activities of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah, 
in cooperation with Fatah, and called for the resumption of 
intifadah activities, including violence against IDF forces and 
settlers, in order to cause as many casualties and as much 
damage to property as possible. As will be recalled, the 
command was disbanded after the signing of the Washington 
agreement in September, but it was reestablished on Sunday. 
  Sources in the territories noted that the command was 
reestablished with the cooperation of Fatah representatives and 
that its demands are a signal to 'Arafat that conducting 
negotiations does not mean control on the ground. The sources 
said that as a result of the erosion in 'Arafat's status, he has 
no choice but to radicalize his positions and to accept the 
demands of the leadership in the territories. [passage omitted]

[passage omitted] 
  He said: We in the PFLP-GC will never halt our Palestinian 
armed struggle in the occupied territories. The coming days 
will witness military operations against this entity in the 
occupied territories, not outside. 
  He said these operations will target the settlers and the 
gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in 
addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps 
as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [PFLP-GC martyr]. 
  He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the 
negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became 
involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing 
happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We 
hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will 
be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will 
benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the 
Zionist enemy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F>
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, DFLP, by Ra'id 
Salihah, in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Salihah] How will the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] react, beyond rhetoric, to 
the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque? 
  [Hawatimah] As soon as we received word about the massacre, 
the DFLP urged our people inside the occupied homeland and 
abroad to observe a general strike for three days. I declared 
this personally over the radio. Our people's response was 
excellent. Confrontations are still going on. They covered all 
of the 1948-occupied territory, from the Galilee to the Negev. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Do you support fedayeen operations against the 
settlers? How will you react militarily? 
  [Hawatimah] We have stated clearly that the crime will not 
go unpunished. The punishment will definitely be against the 
settlers who are armed to the teeth in full view of the 
occupation. The crimes of the settlers are the outcome of the 
current political climate and Rabin's hawkish policy. Rabin 
insists on having everything: territory, crossings, and 
security. He is also pursuing settlement activity. He 
earmarked $100 million in 1994 to expand the settlements. This 
is in addition to the ideology preached by the Israeli rabbis, 
urging settlement and expansion and making the Palestinian 
territory a disputed land. Therefore, our fedayeen operations 
will necessarily target the settlers. Every settler is a target 
of the strugglers of the Red Star Battalions, the DFLP's armed 
wing. The past stands witness that we are faithful to what we 
declare. The coming days will see appropriate reactions to this 
horrendous massacre. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, by Ra'id Salihah in Amman; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Salihah] How will Hamas react to the brutal 
massacre perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque? 
  [Ghawshah] [passage omitted] This strike is going to further 
Hamas's determination, will, and strength. Everyone knows that 
Hamas's fighters, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam groups, are well 
educated in the Islamic doctrine, which excels the Torah's 
doctrine. Therefore, the battle is now between the followers of 
the Torah and the followers of the Koran. We believe that 
victory will be for the followers of the Koran. [passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Is there any specific plan to carry out operations 
in the near future? 
  [Ghawshah] The way Hamas acts is a difficult one, and it is 
also difficult to understand its organization. However, there 
is room for movement. Hamas will certainly deal blows to the 
Zionist enemy, including the settlers. [passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Do you plan to assassinate those responsible for 
the massacre? 
  [Ghawshah] You know that the killing of individuals does not 
lead to the required results. We want to strike at and damage a 
major center of the Zionist enemy. The mujahidin will choose 
proper targets, God willing. 
  [Salihah] Do you not believe that it is time for all 
factions 
to launch an armed struggle? 
  [Ghawshah] The blessed march, which was staged in Amman and 
in which we took part, proposed that and also called for a final 
withdrawal, rather than a halt or a suspension of the 
negotiations, and for the resumption of armed struggle. This is 
a hard road, but it is the only way to preserve the whole 
nation's dignity. 
  [Salihah] How do you view President 'Arafat's decision to 
continue negotiations despite all that has happened? 
  [Ghawshah] We urged him through the media and stressed that 
this is his last chance and that this was our last call. If he 
does not return to his people and resume armed struggle, he will 
be viewed by his people as part of the Zionists and he will pay 
the price. We also said that if he and his clique continued to 
pursue their current path, the curses of God, the people, and 
history will befall him. 
  He accepted Clinton's invitation before the martyrs' blood 
was even dry. No nationalist would ever do that. However, it 
seems that due to a widespread popular protest, he began to 
retreat bit by bit and to set some conditions. 
  [Salihah] You said this was your last warning to 'Arafat. 
Does this mean that you will liquidate him if he does not 
respond? 
  [Ghawshah] No. Hamas does not believe in political 
assassination. The last warning comes from the Palestinian 
people themselves. The people will distinguish between what is 
legitimate and what is illegitimate and between what is wrong 
and what is right. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dozens of Hebron and Qiryat Arba' settlers 
yesterday received orders restricting their movements in Hebron. 
The orders are signed by the commander of the Central Command. 
Orders were also issued yesterday to seven Samaria settlers, 
restricting their movements in Arab population centers, 
including Nabulus. Among those who received the orders are four 
settlers from Kfar Tapuah, including Binyamin Kahana. Two 
others are from the settlement of Yitzhar in Samaria. According 
to the order, the weapons of the seven will be confiscated. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 2 March, in a page A1 report 
by Nadav Shragay, adds the following: "The settlers who received 
the orders were told they can appeal the order before the 
appeals committee sitting in the Ramallah military court."]

  [Text] Kakh member Barukh Marzel has declared from his 
hiding place that the four Kakh members who are hiding from the 
security forces this morning started a hunger strike to protest 
what they term the government's witch hunt against them. 
  David Axelrod, the Kahana Hay spokesman who resides in Kfar 
Tapuah, told our correspondent Gil Litman that yesterday he 
received an order restricting his movements and banning him from 
entering Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. He was also ordered to return 
his army-issued weapon to the IDF. Axelrod told our 
correspondent he will not obey the two orders and that he 
intends to come to Qiryat Arba' in order to visit the grave of 
Barukh Goldstein. Axelrod claims he should keep his weapon for 
self-defense purposes.

  [Text] Mike Guzofsky, spokesman of the U.S. chapter of the 
Kahana Hay movement, says that if the Israeli Government outlaws 
the movement, it should not be surprised later if the Kahana 
followers act undemocratically. In an interview with Qobi 
Meydan today, Guzofsky said the present government and Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin should be toppled. 
  [Begin recording] [Guzofsky] Support should be mustered for 
the removal of Yitzhaq Rabin from government. Definitely. 
  [Meydan] You do not rule out the physical option. 
  [Guzofsky] I do not know what you mean by physical: Putting 
a bullet in his head? Is that what you mean? 
  [Meydan] I was just asking. 
  [Guzofsky] You were just asking. I think that so far, the 
actions of Kahana Hay in Israel, the United States, and 
throughout the world have been within the law. In Israel the 
rules are different because Yitzhaq Rabin and the fools in 
government are preventing Kahana Hay and Kakh from operating 
legally and democratically. So they should not be surprised 
afterward. 
  [Meydan] Do I hear a threat? 
  [Guzofsky] I did not make a threat. I am merely saying that 
when a regime prevents its people from electing freely and when 
it prevents the Kahana Hay and Kakh people from being elected, 
they should not ask afterward why we act undemocratically. [end

<F P=106> [By Palestinian Affairs Editor Jasim Murad] </F>
  [Excerpt] Baghdad, Amman, Tunis--[passage omitted] In a 
statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, leader of 
the Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, said the Zionist 
crime at the Ibrahimi mosque was planned and premeditated by the 
occupation authorities and the troops in charge of guarding the 
Ibrahimi Mosque. This has been shown by the fact that the 
Zionist assailants withdrew freely with all their weapons under 
the cover of the enemy troops surrounding the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
Al-Tamimi asked: How can an individual -- as the occupation 
authorities are claiming -- kill and wound 400 people? He said: 
We have made a clear and specific decision deeming every 
Zionist inside the occupied territory a target of our 
revolutionaries' bullets. He added: We will carry out the 
Palestinian response inside the occupied territory before the 
blood of martyrs dries. He urged all other Palestinian factions 
to stop their denunciations and to embark on real action that 
restores the dignity of the blood that has been spilled at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Judy Lotz video report] </F>
  [Text] Restrictive orders were issued today also against 
residents of the settlement of Tapuah in Samaria. Judy Lotz met 
two of them, who declared they will disobey the orders: 
  [Begin recording] [Lotz] What does your order say, David? 
  [David Axelrod] My order says that I may not enter Hebron 
and Qiryat Arba' for three months, starting yesterday. 
  [Lotz] Did you have to turn in your gun? 
  [Axelrod] I did not receive this order, but I heard it 
exists. 
  [Lotz] Did they come to take away your gun? 
  [Axelrod] They left notice that I should turn it in. 
  [Lotz] Did you? 
  [Axelrod] I did not, and I have no such intention. 
  [Lotz] You are violating the law, are you not? 
  [Axelrod] Am I? Forsaking Jews to be murdered is a violation 
of our beliefs. 
  [Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana] I do not believe people will turn in 
their guns. I find this hard to believe. I believe people will 
rather sit in jail. 
  [Lotz] Will you turn in your gun? 
  [Kahana] I will turn in nothing. I find these orders 
insignificant. They are illegal, immoral, and unreasonable. 
  [Lotz] Will you travel to Hebron and Nabulus, in defiance of 
the orders? 
  [Kahana] I will go anywhere I please in this country. [end 
recording] 
  The police arrested today Eyal Noqed, another Kakh activist, 
who is one of the five the police are seeking to place under 
administrative detention. Our police affairs correspondent Uri 
Kohen-Aharonov has learned that Noqed was captured in an 
apartment in Ra'anana, following intelligence information. 
Currently, there are two Kakh members in police detention. 
Qiryat Arba' residents fear that exile orders will be issued 
this evening.

  [Text] The Hawks of the western sector of the Palestine 
National Liberation Movement (Fatah) have appealed to 
Arab--Druze and Bedouin--soldiers in the Israeli Army, who are 
working in what is called the Zionist border guard and security 
bodies, to rebel against their leadership in the Army and border 
guard. 
  A statement addressing these soldiers was distributed in 
Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, and other cities. The statement says: 
Your history, dignity, Arabism, and Arab magnanimity require 
you to rebel. This call is a sincere invitation to rescue 
yourself from the quagmire of crime against our kinsfolk and 
clan. 
  The statement adds: Our call is genuine and does not stem 
from emotions. Throughout the years, we have persevered and we 
have suppressed our pain and sorrow as we saw part of our own 
people practice killing and terrorism against our people 
everywhere in southern Lebanon and Palestine. 
  The statement says: It is now time for you to return to your 
genuine Arab dignity and magnanimity that was upheld by the 
great struggler Sultan Pasha al-Atrash followed by the great 
struggler Kamal Junblat. Let those heroes be your paragon of 
honor and dignity. 
  The statement says colonialist invaders are evicted and 
defeated and oppressed people triumph. History tells us about 
the invaders and colonialists. Remember your ancestors at Jabal 
al-'Arab who, led by struggler Sultan Pasha al-'Atrash, defeated 
and evicted the French, just as they were evicted from Algeria 
and just as the United States left Vietnam in defeat. 
  Fatah Hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied 
Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are 
being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you 
and the occupation army and other security bodies will not 
protect you. 
  The warning says: It is time for retribution. Your only 
chance is to immediately leave the settlements before it is too 
late. The warning adds: If you leave, you will survive. Leave 
the settlement immediately. Your life from now on will be at 
the mercy of our heroic men.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Rana al-Husayni] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A German man was stabbed in the back early 
Sunday in downtown Amman by a woman who was enraged by the 
massacre of more than 69 Palestinians in her West Bank hometown 
of Hebron a police report said. 
  The attack took place when Klaus Eichen, 23, his wife and 
son 
were visiting the Roman amphithreatre in the busy al-Hashimiyah 
Squar area. 
  According to the report, Mr. Eichen and his family arrived 
in 
Jordan on Saturday. 
  Mr. Eichen told police he was leaving the amphitheatre when 
a 
woman attacked him with a knife. 
  The woman, a 27-year-old who was identified only as N.N.K., 
stabbed Mr. Eichen in the back, then she tried to attack his 
wife. Bystanders intervened to restrain the attacker who was 
arrested by police. 
  In her testimony N.N.K. said she attacked the tourists to 
avenge the victims of the Hebron massacre. 
  The stabbing attack is the second such incident reported in 
the two days following the terrorist assault in Hebron. [see 
previous Terrorism Report for report on 25 March stabbing] 
  After the announcement of the massacre on Friday, an angry 
Hebron native stabbed a 77-year-old British tourist, Howard 
Long, in the same area. A medical report had said that Mr. 
Long's injuries were not serious. 
  A hospital official at King Husayn Medical Centre, where Mr. 
Eichen was being treated, told the JORDAN TIMES that the young 
German man suffered minor injuries in the back, and that he was 
released from hospital the same day. 
  The official said the Eichen family, who were on a two-day 
stopover in Jordan, left the Kingdom that same evening for India 
to continue their tour. 
  Details were unavailable on the background of the assailant. 
  Ingrid Liedgens, the head of the press and cultural section 
at the German embassy in Amman, told the JORDAN TIMES that the 
attack was an unfortunate incident, but luckily it was not fatal. 
  She said the embassy has warned all German tourists and 
citizens residing in Jordan to take extra precautions and to 
avoid going to the downtown Amman area until the situation has 
calmed down. 
  "As long as there are no new reported incidents in the 
Kingdom, everything will be normal," Ms. Liedgens said. 
  Several Western embassies had earlier advised their 
nationals 
to exercise caution while moving about or visiting places in the 
next few days. 
  This attack comes one day following His Majesty King 
Husayn's 
call for calm among the public.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Afghan' Jordanians Admit Bombing </F>
and Assassination Plot"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A Jordanian official 
source has announced that the results of the interrogation of 
the detainees held in connection with the case of the explosions 
and assassinations plot in Jordan necessitated more arrests of 
suspects linked to the 23 detainees known as "Afghan Arabs" and 
confiscation of arms kept in their hideouts. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the prosecutor of the 
Jordanian State Security Court, which handles cases affecting 
state security, expected the number of the detainees to 
increase, and that a number of Kalashnikov machineguns, 
explosives, and pistols were found in the possession of the 
accused and in some hideouts in Amman. 
  Disclosing some details about the detainees, the source said 
that they had all gone to Afghanistan via a third state, that 
some of them received training there for three months on various 
types of weapons, and that the detainees did not know one 
another but they did know their leader and commander who is also 
now under detention with them. 
  The source added that they operated in small cells with one 
secret official in charge and that they did not give their 
organization any name because they did not want such a name to 
circulate and eventually lead to their exposure. 
  He said that they had confessed that they all belonged to 
one 
group which had one leader who is now detained with them, and 
that they used to arrange their travel to Afghanistan through 
individuals returning from Afghanistan who would supply them 
with air tickets and addresses to go to in other states, and 
that they would stay at some relief home [Bayt i'ashah] until 
someone came to provide them with the necessary information and 
requirements after which they would go to Afghanistan. 
  They emphasized in their confessions that they had worked 
for 
the elimination of vice which, to them, meant movie theaters, 
video cassettes, bars, and shops which sell alcoholic drinks. 
They also confessed that they had planned to assassinate 
Jordanian and Palestinian prominent civilian and military 
figures, and that their actions were also aimed against the 
current peace process and geared toward preventing the 
conclusion of peace agreements with Israel. The Jordanian 
source expected the investigation to be completed and the entire 
case to be referred to the Jordanian State Security Court around 
the middle of this current month. 
  The recent explosion in the Salwa movie theater in the town 
of al-Zarqa', in which Egyptian citizen 'Id al-Jahhalin (the man 
who planted the bomb) was injured and had his two legs and one 
finger in his left hand amputated, enabled the Jordanian 
authorities to lay their hands on the first strings of the case. 
  Al-Jahhalin confessed that his task was only to plant the 
detonator in the timer of the explosive device which included 
four coconut-shaped bombs. 
  Al-Jahhalin, who is now at al-Zarqa' government hospital, 
said that he regretted what he did.

  [Text] Kuwait City, March 2 (AFP) -- A bombing at a Kuwaiti 
cinema on Monday was carried out by Moslem militants, the owner 
of Kuwait's movie houses said in remarks published Wednesday. 
  "The blast was probably a religious warning due to the holy 
month of Ramadan," Yusuf al-Halabi, manager of the Kuwait 
National Cinema Company, told the ARAB TIMES. 
  "Last year we received a threat at the same time but it was 
not carried out," he added. 
  A security source who requested anonymity, however, said he 
believed Iraqi agents planted the bomb. 
  The Interior Ministry first said two people were slightly 
wounded in the blast, but a high-ranking police officer said 
only a guard suffered a slight head wound. 
  The Interior Ministry stepped up security measures around 
the 
nine cinemas in Kuwait City after Monday's bombing, sources said. 
  Attacks on cinemas, video shops, show business poeple and 
music stores, which are considered by fundamentalists as 
activities contrary to Islam, began after Kuwait was freed from 
a seven-month Iraqi occupation, in February 1991.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by </F>
unidentified KEYHAN correspondent--date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] Do you consider it 
possible that the Lebanese Government will sign a compromising 
accord with Israel? 
  [Fadlallah] Lebanon's stance regarding the compromise is 
closely linked to that of Syria, and therefore, Lebanon will not 
sign anything before Syria does. This is because there is an 
agreement between Syria and Lebanon on the basis of which the 
Lebanese Government will not sign any accord with Israel unless 
it has been previously agreed to by Syria. 
  [KEYHAN] What steps will the Lebanese Islamic Movement, 
especially Hizballah, take against the signing of a compromising 
accord by Syria or Lebanon? 
  [Fadlallah] It is obvious that in such circumstances, the 
Islamic Movement will be forced to appraise the situation in a 
precise and perceptive manner. This is because in that case, it 
will have to reappraise and assess the situation from its own 
vantage point and stance and to view the outcome and 
repercussions of such a step on the Islamic Movement. Of 
course, this will be affected by changing circumstances and 
certain exigencies. 
  However, it is natural that we will not endorse any accord 
between Israel and Arab countries. Even if such an accord takes 
place, we will continue our opposition but the tactics and means 
of combatting such an accord or the fallout of this opposition 
or its expression will all depend on the conditions and 
exigencies that arise, and the Islamists will appraise them with 
regard to the interests of Islam in general. This is exactly 
the same as the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran which 
has repeatedly expressed its overt opposition to the official 
recognition of Israel and has even stressed that it will not 
directly deal with those who have compromised. [passage omitted] 
  [KEYHAN] At present, the strategy of the White House is to 
eliminate the Islamic Movement in the Middle East and from the 
countries contiguous to the Zionist regime. It appears that the 
compromising accord between the Zionist regime and the PLO can 
be considered a step in this direction. What is the modus 
operandi envisaged by the Islamic Movement in combatting such a 
strategy? 
  [Fadlallah] In my opinion, the United States cannot 
eliminate the Islamic Movement from the region, as the White 
House does not have the necessary means to do so. We observe 
that the U.S. foreign policy has encountered many obstructions 
and complexities in numerous countries in such a manner that it 
has been unable to implement its policies there. We do not 
consider the United States to be very versatile in the region. 
This is because the nations still have freedom of action to the 
extent that if they cannot defeat the policies of the White 
House, they can at least disrupt them. 
  In addition, I do not believe that the United States has 
envisaged the elimination of the Islamic Movement in its current 
calculations. Instead, it appears that the United States is 
moving along two lines. The first line is to approach the 
Islamic Movement and to explore possibilities of establishing 
contact with it. This is evident from the current efforts being 
made to establish relations with the Egyptian Islamic movement. 
The second line involves U.S. efforts to undermine the Islamic 
Movement for its ultimate disarmament and embargo. 
  This is because the United States is not able to eliminate 
the Islamic Movement which has such deep roots among the Islamic 
masses. I believe that the Islamists will gain more popular 
support as a result of the U.S. pressure and thus the White 
House's pressure will not be able to undermine the Islamic 
Movement. 
  [KEYHAN] The people of southern Lebanon are still being 
subjected to daily attacks by the Zionists. In the event of an 
accord between the Zionists and Lebanon what will be the fate of 
southern Lebanon? 
  [Fadlallah] [passage omitted] Obviously, southern Lebanon is 
suffering from daily savage attacks on southern Lebanon and this 
is why the Islamic Resistance Movement came into being, that is, 
in order to prove a firm impediment to the domination of the 
Zionists on southern Lebanon. If this Resistance Movement had 
not been active in southern Lebanon, the Zionists would have 
occupied all of southern Lebanon by various means. [passage 
omitted] 
  We, in the Arab world, and in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
should be very vigilant [passage omitted] because once the 
Arab-Zionist compromise takes effect, then precise planning for 
exerting pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran from the 
economic and security point of view will be carried out. The 
Arabs may be incited through various means to impose an embargo 
on Iran. In this regard, the American lackeys, especially the 
countries in Iran's neighborhood, will be enlisted to put more 
pressure on Iran. 
  [KEYHAN] Recently, Turkey announced that it is willing to 
cooperate with Israel in order to combat terrorism. 
  [Fadlallah] Of course, by terrorism they mean the liberation 
movements in the area. [passage omitted] 
  [KEYHAN] What is your message to the Iranian nation? 
  [Fadlallah] My message to the Muslim Iranian nation on the 
15th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution is that Imam Khomeyni 
-- may God be pleased with him -- was able to deal a blow to the 
powers of world arrogance with the support and the steadfastness 
of your nation. When the Iranian nation stood alongside the 
imam the Islamic world and the oppressed of the world stood by 
you and the imam. I believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
is a divine trust for the Muslim people of Iran. I hope that 
God Almighty bestows this bounty on us as well. [passage 
omitted] 
  I consider His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i to be a 
personality endowed with immense acumen and exceptional 
qualities that are necessary for Islamic leadership. He has 
immense knowledge of the international issues, especially of the 
Islamic world which he studies and follows intensively and 
continually. 
  I believe that the Muslim nation of Iran and the other 
Muslim 
nations who follow him provide that strength which is necessary 
for such leadership and for combatting the plots and designs of 
the infidels and the powers of world arrogance. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ, 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah said: In the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we cannot help 
but see the ugly American face, because the United States has 
provided Israel with every means of protection against 
international moves to condemn it. He said the U.S. president's 
call to the Palestinians and Israelis to move the negotiations 
to Washington is meant to save the Palestinians' face and to 
insinuate that the Palestinians have broken down the Zionist 
barrier placed by Israel between the United States and the 
Palestinians. This gives the impression that the U.S. 
president's direct sponsorship of the negotiations might give 
the Palestinians the unrealistic dream that Washington will 
pressure the Jews to accept what they have rejected in Taba. 
But the issue is this: The United States will exert more 
pressure on the Palestinians by claiming to discuss the need for 
peace and for opposing the extremist Jews. 
  Fadlallah said there should be a Palestinian stance that 
reflects respect for the blood of the Palestinian people and 
there should also be a firm Arab stance mobilizing all the Arab 
factors of strength that will confront this massacre and its 
implications so that the world can know that the Arabs have 
broken the mold of ineffectiveness. [passage omitted] 
  Fadlallah stressed that the resistance will stay if there is 
a limited Israeli withdrawal from the south and might stay even 
if there is a withdrawal from all of the south. He said: I 
believe President al-Asad understands the value of the 
resistance in restoring Arab dignity and in pressuring Israel 
and the U.S. stance. 
  Regarding reports of U.S. fears of possible Israeli 
operations in the south, Fadlallah said: The method of 
discussing fears is the strongest form of threat. 
  He said he does not believe the pope's scheduled visit to 
Lebanon is of any unusual importance. He said: I do not 
believe it will have any important political impact on Lebanon's 
major issue, namely, the Israeli occupation. As we can see, the 
pope's gift to the Lebanese and Arab peoples before his visit 
was the quick recognition of Israel. We do not believe this 
gift encourages the Lebanese to think that this visit will 
greatly benefit their ambitions.

  [Excerpts] Voice of Lebanon correspondent George Shahin 
reports form the scene of the explosion: 
  [Shahin] We are reporting to you from the scene of the 
explosion in the Zuq Musbih area, where Army, Internal Security 
forces, and Civil Defense units, along with other security 
agencies have cordoned off the area. Throngs of citizens have 
assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam. 
According to the information announced by the interior minister 
a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of 
others injured in the blast. He declared that the church and the 
worshippers inside it have escaped a horrible massacre because 
not all the explosive charges planted in the church went off. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security 
agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest 
death toll? 
  [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I 
believe there are nine dead. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big 
massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went 
off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the 
result would have been devastating. 
  [Shahin] Anyway, the security forces are conducting 
investigations inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden 
to enter the church for security reasons. They will be allowed 
in later after the initial investigations. Destruction and 
devastation are evident inside and outside the church. There 
are no doors or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged, 
along with homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area 
and there is heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal 
Security Forces are trying to facilitate traffic.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah called the 
bombing at Sayyidat al-Najat Church an atrocity and lamented the 
death of innocents. The bombing, he said, signals a new pattern 
of attacks on places of worship. He added that the crime is 
designed to disturb the country's security and political life 
and unsettle the public's renewed sense of civic peace. 
  Israeli hands cannot be absolved of this crime, whose 
purpose 
was to divert attention from the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
and trigger a new cycle of violence in the country, Fadlallah 
stated. He called on the authorities to uncover the evil hands 
that carried out the crime.

February-- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpt] The movement's leadership denounces the appalling 
massacre committed by Israel and its agents against our people 
worshipping at Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. It 
believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's 
daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied 
Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses 
that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and 
practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
are the best proof of this. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Beirut, Feb 27 (AFP)--[passage omitted on 
mourning] A four-year-old girl was among those killed when a 
five-kilogram (11-pound) bomb attached to two mortar shells and 
a timing device exploded during a Lenten mass in Zuq Mikha'il. 
  The church was packed with worshippers. 
  Father Antoine Sfayr, who was leading the service, was among 
55 people wounded in the explosion, which rocked the church as 
he began reading from the scriptures. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton, Jordan's King Husayn and Pope 
John Paul II joined in condemnation of the attack. 
  There was no claim of responsibility but an unidentified 
suspect was arrested, prosecutor Tarabayh Rahmah announced late 
Sunday after an emergency meeting of security officials which 
included Syrian officers. 
  The authorities were aware of "a plan to commit attacks in 
places of worship in Lebanon," Rahmah said, noting that the 
suspect was arrested a few days before the blast. 
  Lebanese newspapers, echoing officials here and in Syria, 
pointed an accusing finger at Israel and linked the attack to 
the massacre Friday of 52 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on 
the occupied West Bank. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Judge Munif 'Uwaydat, public prosecutor at the court 
of appeals, has denied a REUTER report that four women were 
arrested in connection with the explosion at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il, that initial investigation 
showed they planted the bomb near the church altar, and that a 
fifth woman believed to be the leader of the gang has fled 
abroad. 'Uwaydat said the investigation is secret and 
continuing. A judicial investigator will be appointed in 
implementation of the Council of Minister's decision. 
  Commenting on the REUTER report, security sources said the 
authorities in such cases detain many suspects and witnesses. 
They added that six women gave testimonies as witnesses and 
were then released. 
  Another security source has categorically denied REUTER's 
report, pointing out that the investigation is completely secret 
and is being conducted by three people supervised by the 
Lebanese Army's intelligence directorate. The investigation is 
being shrouded in the necessary secrecy to achieve quick results. 
  Other sources said that the security authorities have 
detained six people for questioning as witnesses, including 
three women. 
  According to available information, the pertinent security 
authorities recently detained a non-Lebanese person married to a 
woman from Kasrawan district. He frequently visited a religious 
leader and asked him for help to get Lebanese citizenship. 
Security sources said that this person informed the religious 
leader that there was a plan to detonate bombs in various places 
of worship, including Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
He said he received the information from a Lebanese man. 
Instructions were then issued to security forces to keep a 
close watch on the places named and search them after securing 
permission from the religious authorities concerned.

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Nawar 25 [25 February], Jamahirya News 
Agency -- The leader of the revolution [Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] 
made the following statement to JANA: The act committed at 
al-Harim al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the morning of the holy month of 
Ramadan is a horrific terrorist crime. It is one of the 
dirtiest crimes of terrorism and the most vile crimes of war. 
It is premeditated official terrorism being managed by the 
Israeli Government, a policy on which she sat up her entity 
since its establishment, under the protection of the West, and 
cover up provided by the Western forces supporting her terrorist 
policy which is founded on massacres. Although what happened 
represents the ugliest act of terrorism ever seen in the world 
and an act of blatant and gross terrorism, but we challenge the 
West to declare this reality and admit that the act carried out 
by the Israelis is a pre-planned act of official terrorism and 
part of a long chain of Israeli terrorist acts, and to condemn 
the Israelis for their terrorism. 
  The West, who put the names of the Palestinian people's 
freedom fighters on the black list, are supplying the Israeli 
terrorist with arms, nuclear weapons and F-15 and F-16 war 
planes. 
  It is the West who is supporting Israeli terrorism and 
sponsor it while they treat Palestinian freedom fighters as 
criminals despite the fact that they are fighting for the most 
sacred humanitarian cause in modern times. We believe that if 
there was a real security council other than the one dominated 
by the Christians, and there was a real United Nations, other 
than dominated by the Christians, we would have seen anyone who 
supported the Israeli terrorism and support it with weapons, 
nuclear weapons and other supplies put on the black list and 
subjected to air, naval and land embargo and be punished harshly 
for being a partner in terrorism and supplying the Israeli 
terrorist camp with weapons. We challenge the international 
community, if there is one, to fulfill their humanitarian and 
required duty to assert justice. And after what the world has 
seen this morning is their anyone who can claim that 'Abu Nidal 
and Ahmad Jibril. After their terrorism and the premeditated 
and organized official terrorism which may ensue by the Israeli 
entity, there is no terrorist state in the world like the 
Israeli entity and there is no state sponsoring terrorism in the 
world like those states which sponser Israel and supply her with 
weapons and forge a strategic alliance with her. 
  'Abu Nidal, Ahmad Jibril and other fighters of the 
Palestinian people are angels if compared with the Israeli 
savages, for the Palestinians have never committed horrific 
cirmes like those committed by the Israelis against innocent 
worshippers in this holy month. The Palestinian fighters are 
fighting in defence of their land occupied by the Israeli 
invaders and usurpers who came to it from overseas to commit 
these atrocities which shock human conscience. What is happening 
nowadays confirm the credibility of our viewpoint regarding this 
issue and prove the correctness of our dicta which we have 
repeatedly asserted.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has said that the rebels on 24 
February detained five UN employees working for Operation 
Lifeline Sudan in the area of Attar al-Qulayb, situated between 
(Tongau) and Malakal in Upper Nile State. A Foreign Ministry 
statement said in this connection that the UN employees were on 
a reconnaissance mission agreed upon by Operation Lifeline Sudan 
to carry out a survey to assess relief requirements and to 
organize a campaign for the vaccination of children in the area. 
  The statement said that the detained UN employees were four 
Sudanese and a Briton, namely (Brian Tattersall), a Briton 
working for the FAO; (John Owal), a Sudanese working for the 
FAO; Dr. Malik Muhammad al-Badawi, a Sudanese working for 
UNICEF; and (Christopher Farmela Noli), a Sudanese working for 
UNICEF. The Foreign Ministry said that on 27 February (Brian 
Tattersall), the Briton, was released but not the others, who 
are Sudanese employees of the United Nations. They have been 
flown to Nairobi. 
  The statement said that the commander of the rebels, (Jacob 
Miarbin), stated in his report on the attempted aggression that 
the aid workers' return to the town of Attar was not guaranteed 
on the pretext of military operations in the area. However, the 
area is completely secure and this is confirmed by the fact that 
the steamboat (Baldiyah) which they traveled on, continued to 
travel unhindered and was moored at Attar, which was made the 
center for the vaccination campaign. 
  The Foreign Ministry said it was not surprised by this 
inhuman stand on the part of the rebel movement, which has never 
cared about values and ideals. This incident is only another 
link in a series of crimes it has committed against the 
innocent, starting with its assassination of relief workers in 
September 1992 and its attacks on relief trains in May and 
November 1993, as well as attacks on relief boats in January and 
May 1993. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement said that the Sudanese 
Government condemns and denounces this barbarous behavior of the 
rebels and said it will hold the rebel movement fully 
responsible for the safety of the detained persons. It demanded 
the release of the detained persons immediately. The statement 
confirmed that this action must be regarded as a violation of 
the tripartite agreement signed by the Sudanese Government, the 
United Nations, and the rebels to ensure the safety of Operation 
Lifeline Sudan. It is also a violation of international norms. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement demanded that the United 
Nations ensure the safety, protection, and return of its four 
Sudanese employees who have been detained and demanded their 
immediate release without any prior conditions.

  [Text] Mr. Awad Khalifah, the commissioner general of 
relief and rehabilitation, has appealed to the United Nations 
and the international community to condemn the rebel movement 
and adopt a resolute stance towards its aggressive actions. In 
the course of an interview for our reporter, His Excellency 
confirmed that the rebel movement had detained five UN employees 
of Operation Lifeline in the Upper Nile area, saying that the 
rebel movement habitually violated its covenants and agreements. 
He said detaining UN employees while they were doing their 
humanitarian work was aggressive and barbarous. His Excellency 
condemned the movement for releasing the British UN employee and 
transporting him to Nairobi through the United Nations without 
saying what had happened to the remaining employees who are 
Sudanese.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] London AL-WASAT in Arabic in its 21-27 
February issue carries on pages 10-14 an approximately 3,500 
word report on visits made by its correspondent in Yemen to "the 
prisons of Aden, Abyan, and Lahij early December last year where 
he interviewed several detainees accused of carrying out several 
explosions in the economic capital of Yemen in 1992, of 
assassinating officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party, and 
attacking others over the past three years." Report also 
mentions that AL-WASAT interviewed Jamal Najib Muhammad 
al-Nahdi, the main defendant in these explosions "in an Arab 
capital, during which he refused to be photographed" and after 
receiving assurances that "the interview will be published at 
least two weeks later to give him time to go to another place." 
  The report says that al-Nahdi, age 22, was "one of the 
hundreds of Arabs who had joined an organization called 
al-Qa'idah [the base] to form a specialized and well-trained 
group of Arab mujahdin in Afghanistan in mid-1980. The report 
also says that al-Nahdi said he carried out three operations 
against the U.S. forces and boasted that he "confronted the YSP 
and challenged the United States." He admitted that he had 
fired "missiles on its forces at Aden airport, and detonated one 
of its positions in one of the city's hotels while the U.S. 
forces were on their way to Somalia late 1992." Later on, 
al-Nahdi says that he "is proud that he had foiled a U.S. scheme 
to use Aden as a rear base in its military operations in the 
region, Somalia, and elsewhere." He denies YSP officials' 
accusations of the "existence of an international Jihad 
organization and that he is one of the leaders of a major 
organization in Yemen." 
  Elaborating on the first attack against the U.S. forces in 
Aden, al-Nahdi says: "We wanted to attack the YSP, but we 
hesitated because we feared there would be innocent people and 
Muslims among the losses. When the Americans came to Aden, we 
saw that this was a good opportunity. This was in November 
1992. We learned from officials in the government that the YSP 
intended to permit the establishment of a U.S. base, 
specifically on Abyan coast." He later says "We videotaped 
everything, including the U.S. installations in the airport and 
the tape was later taken by intelligence head 'Adnan al-Bid, the 
son of 'Ali Salim al-Bid." Al-Nahdi affirms that "the idea of 
striking at the Americans in Aden was my idea. There was no 
organization behind us. Everything was planned and carried out 
in a period of not more than five days." After speaking about 
how he obtained weapons, al-Nahdi says that "the first operation 
was successful as the two missiles I and Wahib 'Abd-al-Salam 
fired hit their targets." 
  According to al-Nahdi, the second operation was "to strike 
at 
the espionage headquarters the Americans had established in the 
Golden Coast Hotel." Al-Nahdi admits "he had placed a big bomb 
in the electricity room on the fourth floor below the U.S. 
espionage room. The explosion of the bomb was sufficient to 
destroy a major part of that floor as well as part of the fifth 
floor. The explosion killed a Yemeni hotel worker, an Austrian 
tourist, and others." 
  Speaking about the third operation, al-Nahdi says "it was 
intended to scare as many U.S. soldiers as possible in the Aden 
Hotel yard." He added "We planted a time bomb that was set to 
explode at the time they always return to the hotel. But, God 
wished it otherwise. They were late to arrive that night" and 
that having noticed this, he ran "to defuse the bomb and change 
the time for it to go off. But, it exploded and I was wounded." 
He then says that he was arrested and taken to hospital.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Svetlana Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg, Feb 25 (TASS) -- Secret police in 
the second biggest Russian city said on Friday it had arrested a 
group of terrorists and found out that they had planned an 
attempt on the life of Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak and an act of 
terror against the government building in Moscow. 
  Head of the anti-terrorist unit of the St. Petersburg 
Counterintelligence Service Aleksandr Kuznetsov told reporters 
that on February 2 five terrorists were caught red-handed after 
they had seized five revolvers and 2,000 cartridges during an 
attack on the guards of the "Zarya" enterprise. 
  According to Kuznetsov, all the five participated in the 
armed opposition rebellion in Moscow last October. He 
identified their leader as Captain 3rd Rank in reserve Aleksandr 
Bogdanov.

"with entire responsibility" that the reports on revealing a 
criminal group preparing an attempt upon the life of St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak "had no grounds." 
  "Nothing like such a group has been revealed, and no one has 
been arrested," the officer said. "Sobchak is under no threat. 
By the way, he is out of the city at the moment." 
  "I regret that some of your colleagues work with so little 
responsibility," the counterintelligence officer told INTERFAX.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Solomenko report: "Was an Attempt on Sobchak's </F>
Life Planned?"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Discord reigns in the mass media 
on this delicate and sensational question. No sooner had 
ITAR-TASS reported that the criminal group arrested in St. 
Petersburg had intended to carry out this attempt, and the St. 
Petersburg Television evening edition of INFORM-TV refuted it, 
citing an officer on duty at the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] St. Petersburg Administration. 
  So whose reports are more reliable? 
  At the beginning of February, IZVESTIYA told its readers: 
Employees of the antiterrorist service at the FCS St. Petersburg 
Administration, together with criminal investigation officers, 
detained an armed group of five people. The arrest took place 
when these robbers attacked the security premises of the "Zarya" 
Science and Production Association, tied up the guards, and 
seized the weapons there. 
  The FCS St. Petersburg Administration Press Center reported 
at that time that those arrested belonged to a grouping which 
"considers it possible to resolve complex political problems by 
terrorist methods." 
  Today the materials gathered during the 
operational-investigation work testify to the fact that the 
members of this grouping did intend to carry out an attempt on 
the life of St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak and attack the 
Government House in Moscow. Aleksandr Kuznetsov, leader of the 
antiterrorism service at the FCS St. Petersburg Administration, 
stated this. 
  The failed terrorists are well known to those who were 
present at rallies conducted by opposition political movements. 
Aleksandr Bogdanov regularly participated in conducting these 
rallies, and he conducted the registration to the "People's 
Volunteer Corps." Maksim Izmailov collaborated closely with the 
"Russian Communist Workers Party Young People's Workers Group" 
and with Nina Andreyeva's brainchild -- "The Young Guard of 
Bolsheviks of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." 
Captain 3rd Rank, Retired, Vladimir Khoukhlyantsev was an 
activist in the St. Petersburg section of the USSR Officers 
Union. 
  Some of them took part in the October events in Moscow.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Prosecutor-General Ali Omerov 
claimed that the Azerbaijani People's Front [APF] headed by 
Elchibey had been preparing to topple President Geydar Aliyev in 
a coup on 5 March. For this reason, 100 APF members have been 
detained since last Sunday. It was also noted that 42 rockets, 
explosives and an arms cache was discovered during a search of a 
building used by APF supporters. 
  The APF denied claims of a coup. One of the APF leaders, 
Nadzhaf Nadzhafov, claimed that the seized arms do not belong to 
APF. The police raided the news conference being held by 
Nadzhaf Nadzhafov at the APF headquarters in Baku, and sealed 
off the building.

<F P=106> [Article signed AdG: "`False Bomb Threat Was Work of </F>
Spanish Secret Service' -- ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] 
Suspects Deny Any Responsibility"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Luis Moreno and Raquel Garcia, the 
two ETA suspects who applied for political asylum in Belgium to 
no avail, heard the news of the bomb threat via Spanish 
television in their flat in Brussels. [see Spain, items 
AU2502115294 and AU2502165294 in previous Terrorism Report] 
Moreno and Garcia are certain that the threats are the work of 
infiltrators from the Spanish secret service. Earlier this 
month the couple appealed against the Belgian decision to not 
recognize them as political refugees. [passage omitted] 
  "They [the Spanish secret service] want to make the life of 
the Belgian Government so difficult that it has to deport us 
from the country," they said. "But we know better. If the ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty] is planning an attack, then it 
does so through its own channels. At the bottom of the 
threatening letter they always put the standard round stamp with 
the logo of the independence movement. Not some Arab signature 
or other." [passage omitted] [see SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in the

<F P=106> [George Suffert editorial: "Dignity of the Republic at </F>
Stake"] 
  [Text] One can expect tears, some teeth-grinding, and a few 
momentous words around the coffin of Yann Piat, the Parliament 
representative for the Hyeres constituency and Republican Party 
member. The police and judges will be urged to waste no time, 
to hunt down the killers and above all, those who sponsored the 
murder of a woman whose integrity and courage were acknowledged 
by all. Then everyone will go back to their own occupation. It 
is a very old flaw in our miserable society: The dead are 
solemnly buried, and then soon forgotten. 
  As for the Hyeres tragedy, the situation may -- alas! -- 
turn 
out to be exemplary. A few hours after the murder, the public 
prosecutor said that "everything seems to indicate that it was 
done by professionals." No doubt this is true; one would only 
wish it will not be made into an alibi. 
  By definition, professional killers slay their designated 
victim without passion but with accuracy; and they make sure 
they leave no evidence behind. Millions of detective motion 
picture and TV serial viewers know all about such details. 
However, there is no hard and fast rule; there are mediocre 
professionals and careless assassins. Sometimes, also, chance 
interferes with action. We shall see whether the investigation 
progresses, whether names can be placed on shadowy figures. 
  It may be necessary to go even further. This murder is not 
only a physical act, it is also a message meant for the whole 
political class, for judges, for policemen, for journalists. 
Whether the murder's sponsors belong to the French naturalized 
Mafia or to the scum of political circles does not make much of 
a difference. In France today as in Italy yesterday, someone is 
trying to scare people. There are issues which politicians 
should refrain from investigating -- drugs especially. Because 
the drug trade is a state within states; because millions of 
people make a living out of it; because it brings unlimited 
wealth to seemingly blameless individuals. 
  What is a mere Parliament representative in the face of this 
huge global industry? Of course, nothing supports this 
explanation right now. But it is exactly what must be on the 
mind of other deputies who have been meticulously working toward 
the defeat of the Mafia and drug traffickers. Once again, the 
two motorcycle men who killed the Hyeres representative on a 
back road were in fact taking aim at France's whole political 
class. 
  This is an absurd threat, though. Politicians are not easily 
terrorized. While they are often cowardly before their 
electors, in front of threats they are not. In any case, they 
will keep in mind Yann Piat's face. Her death may sign the 
beginning of a confrontation between the Mafia and our country's 
political system. As we all know, no mercy may be expected from 
killers; one would like to see the Republic demonstrating equal 
determination. After all, its own dignity is at stake.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Hufelschulte and M. Krischer: "Liaison Man of </F>
the RAF"] 
  [Text] The news from the FRG Interior Ministry came by 
telephone. The caller urged that senior official Karl B. should 
be immediately transferred to another department of the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA). 
  In the BKA president's staff in Wiesbaden, the explosive 
nature of the official order was immediately clear. After a 
brief note about the telephone conversation, the high-ranking 
official picked up the stamp and put "confidential -- official 
secret" on the piece of paper. No one should learn what 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his State Secretary Kurt 
Schelter had just -- on 2 February 1994 -- ordered. 
  The banishment from Bonn hits a dedicated BKA official, who 
has caused serious problems for the German security authorities, 
which have difficulties anyway, and is now radically condemned 
to silence -- eight months after the antiterror operation in Bad 
Kleinen. 
  Senior official Karl B., who was the head of BKA 
Antiterorrism Department Number 11, found out: 
  There is a high probability that Klaus Steinmetz, the 
alleged 
spy of the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution in the Red Army Faction [RAF], is a leading RAF 
activist. 
  The man, who put the investigators on the trail of Birgit 
Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams in Bad Kleinen in June 1993, was a 
top courier of the RAF and obviously knew of secret terror 
operations. However, he kept everything to himself and did not 
tell his controllers at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution about his knowledge. 
  The official BKA paper, which was drawn up by Karl B. and 
which immediately disappeared in a drawer because of the 
relentless analysis, permits only one conclusion: 
  Steinmetz cheated the authorities. He cheated the 
Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution as well as the chief federal prosecutor, who 
suspended proceedings against him on 28 January. 
  "The investigations," Hans-Juergen Foerster of the Chief 
Federal Prosecutor's Office says, "did not give sufficient 
reason to publicly indict him." 
  A BKA official told FOCUS: "They are glad that Steinmetz is 
gone now. They do not want to ask him anything anymore. They 
do not want any answers that would be embarrassing -- 
embarrassing in particular for those who controlled Steinmetz as 
a liaison man and who would now have to realize that they had 
lost control of him and that he might have committed crimes 
while they protected him." 
  Steinmetz, who is hidden somewhere and being prepared for a 
new life with a new identity abroad, would have to face 
indictment according to the uncomfortable BKA paper. 
  According to the findings by the terrorism experts, the guy, 
who according to himself was a minor cog and mediator between 
two camps, is in reality a big shot. As one can read in the BKA 
dossier, on page 17, he is considered to be a person who "is 
tightly integrated in the RAF structures" and can probably "be 
called a supporting member of the RAF." 
  According to the BKA analysis, Steinmetz never took the 
truth 
very seriously. His statements are "incredible" and "in 
complete contradiction" with BKA findings "on essential topics." 
  The alleged liaison man claims to have established contact 
with the RAF command echelon in autumn 1991 in Metz, France. He 
claims to have met Hogefeld and Grams, who were caught in Bad 
Kleinen, in Paris in February 1992. After evaluating all 
evidence, the BKA investigators are certain that he had access 
to the RAF command echelon much earlier. 
  Steinmetz gave a bad impression also with his statements 
about the spectacular RAF attack on the prison in Weiterstadt on 
27 March 1993. 
  Shortly after the operation in Bad Kleinen, he claimed that 
he had learned about the forthcoming blowing up of the super 
prison. Interrogated by the BKA and the Chief Federal 
Prosecutor's Office later on, Steinmetz made a turnabout. "I 
did not know anything about that beforehand," he dictated to the 
reporters and was thus permitted -- the investigating 
authorities knew about the interview -- to publicly present 
himself as innocent. 
  The explosive BKA report leads to other conclusions: 
  Klaus Steinmetz, to whom the RAF gave the cover name 
"Bruno," 
was obviously a top courier of the terrorists who had gone 
underground. He transported documents that, according to the BKA 
dossier, "would permit profound insight into the communication 
structures if the police got hold of them." 
  A task that no one -- and quite certainly not the strictly 
secret RAF command echelon -- would entrust to a "minor cog." 
  The transport of "structurally relevant secret messages," as 
the BKA analysis says about Steinmetz's role, "is probably 
assigned to such persons to whom both the sender and also, in 
particular, the recipient (illegals, RAF members for whom there 
is an arrest warrant) have a long tested and intensive 
relationship of trust." 
  One insider told FOCUS: "Now they are all fluttering with 
fear. After the BKA stock-taking, one must necessarily 
investigate the question of whether the liaison man perhaps knew 
about assassination attacks beforehand, such as about the ones 
on Rohwedder and Herrhausen." 
  Karl B., who is renowned in the BKA because of these expert 
qualifications, suddenly felt an icy wind blowing in his face 
after he had presented his report. 
  Reportedly, he was three times requested to formulate his 
findings about the true role of liaison man Steinmetz 
differently. Karl B., called Charly by his colleagues, stuck to 
his version. The result: The hot document was stamped "not 
usable in court." 
  The Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office, the master of the 
investigations, reacted with irritation to the official, whose 
analysis threatened to torpedo the suspension of the 
investigations against Steinmetz. In a talk with BKA President 
Hans-Ludwig Zachert in January 1994, Karlsruhe Senior Prosecutor 
Gerhard Loechner is said to have harshly criticized the tense 
relationship between the two authorities. The scapegoat was 
found quickly: senior BKA official Karl B. 
  However, also internally, both in the Wiesbaden BKA as well 
as at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution in Mainz, Charly the Steadfast caused big trouble 
with his report. The reason: Important evidence has 
disappeared. 
  The background: According to BKA investigations, Steinmetz 
was handed a particular cargo one day before the operation in 
Bad Kleinen. Wolfgang Grams wanted to send two glasses of red 
currant jam to his parents. Birgit Hogefeld reportedly gave 
Steinmetz two personal letters. After examining the typewriter 
ribbon, it was concluded that one letter was for her mother, the 
other one for a woman from the supporters' scene, who uses the 
cover name Vicky. 
  After the GSG-9 operation the Rhineland-Palatinate Office 
for 
the Protection of the Constitution took over Steinmetz's cargo. 
During an interrogation by the BKA Antiterrorism Department 
Number 24 of 24 August 1993, official G. remembered the jam -- 
however, he claimed not to know anything about the letters. It 
is, however, these two mysteriously disappeared letters that 
make Steinmetz's great importance in the RAF structure clear, 
the suppressed BKA dossier indicates. 
  In the future, the uncomfortable senior official Karl B. is 
supposed to keep his hands off terrorists. As of 1 March 1994, 
he will be transferred to another department -- the Interior 
Ministry has refused any comments about the background of this 
transfer. 
  Charly, the experienced RAF hunter, now has to keep 
statistics about drug-related crimes.

<F P=106> [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE report: "Nothing Was Hushed Up in </F>
the Steinmetz Case"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 28 February -- The FRG Interior Ministry 
and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) denied on 
Monday that disagreeable findings on a leading role of informer 
Steinmetz in the Red Army Faction (RAF) had been held back. 
They also denied press reports that the author of a relevant 
report in the BKA had been transferred against his will by 
Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union). The 
spokesman of the Interior Ministry reported that Kanther and 
Schelter, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, neither 
expressed the wish nor gave the instruction to transfer the 
official. According to the BKA statement, the authors of the 
report saying that the informer was probably a "leading member" 
of the RAF had themselves evaluated the paper as unfit to be 
used by a court. This means that it is unsuited for 
investigating files of the public prosecutor, but it is an 
assessment. However, the authors had never been urged by 
superiors or external authorities to change or withdraw the 
report. The contents of the report has been taken into account 
in the current investigations, also regarding Steinmetz, and 
were sent to the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office on 26 
October 1993. The internal transfer of the head of the section 
for terrorism was carried out in the BKA alone and with the 
agreement of the official, it was stated. Meanwhile, the BKA 
has tried to find out who might have passed on the controversial 
information to the press. Since the beginning of last week, the 
prosecuting authority is carrying out investigations in the BKA 
because of the suspicion that official secrets were disclosed.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The role of liaison man Klaus 
Steinmetz, who was uncovered during the antiterrorism operation 
in Bad Kleinen, in the Red Army Faction (RAF) has not been 
finally clarified by the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control 
Committee. There are still "incongruities" concerning his 
relationship with the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, participants revealed after a 
meeting of the committee in Bonn on Wednesday [2 March]. 
  Thus, it is unclear what Steinmetz did for the authority and 
why the Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution did 
not tell the Federal Government earlier about the liaison man, 
who was allegedly infiltrated in the RAF command echelon, it was 
said. It was stressed that the suspension of the criminal 
proceedings against Steinmetz, which was ordered by the chief 
federal prosecutor's office, is only a temporary measure. 
Further insights might be gained from the criminal proceedings 
against Birgit Hogefeld, who was arrested in Bad Kleinen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antonio Asuncion </F>
by Isabel San Sebastian in Madrid; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [San Sebastian] Following 
the latest killing perpetrated in Barcelona, to what can the 
failures in the previous attempts be attributed? To chance and 
luck or to the weakness and disorganization of what is left of 
the gang [Basque Homeland and Liberty -- ETA]? 
  [Asuncion] I have my own opinions, and there are opinions to 
suit all tastes. The important thing is that they failed in 
those attacks. 
  [San Sebastian] It is also important to know why... 
  [Asuncion] I believe that they are not very familiar with 
the explosives which they are using, but you will forgive me for 
not entering into technical explanations. 
  [San Sebastian] You stated on your arrival at the ministry 
that you considered the contacts with ETA closed. If the 
"Azkoiti way" was, as was said from this ministry, a police way 
of finding out what was happening inside the gang and creating 
splits, why was it abandoned? 
  [Asuncion] I have recognized no legacy of contacts with ETA 
from Algiers. As far as Azkoiti is concerned, he is an ETA 
member who served his sentence in France and who, according to 
my information, is in favor of renouncing violence, like many 
other prisoners, and is trying to persuade the armed gang to 
renounce violence. But that is no police way; it is the same 
thing that is happening with groups such as Elkarri, which 
belongs to the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] milieu, and 
which is beginning to say that violence is not the way. 
  [San Sebastian] I will put it to you another way. Since 
your arrival at the ministry, has this ministry any way of 
knowing what is happening inside ETA? 
  [Asuncion] This ministry knows what may be happening within 
a gang of mafiosi, drug traffickers, or criminals through 
informers, about whom, as is natural, I will not say a word. 
  [San Sebastian] If French justice has now granted the 
extradition of Azkoiti, who was the leader of the roving 
commando, and this man no longer counts for anything, why is he 
living peacefully in an apartment in Paris? 
  [Asuncion] I do not know; it is certainly a matter which I 
will have to check. 
  [San Sebastian] Of course. Did the Basque Socialist Party 
[PSE] leaders discuss their initiative of beginning contacts 
with Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] No, of course not, but in any event these are 
measures which the PSE must discuss within itself. For its 
part, the government must carry out its election program. 
  [San Sebastian] I find it very hard to believe that the PSE 
would embark upon such a venture without the blessing of Ferraz 
Street [Socialist Party headquarters]... 
  [Asuncion] They have embarked upon nothing. They have 
announced that there is a number of ideas worth studying. 
  [San Sebastian] Were you acquainted with that plan? 
  [Asuncion] I became acquainted with it later. 
  [San Sebastian] And what was your opinion? 
  [Asuncion] That the government must stand by what was agreed 
at the Ajuria Enea palace, and that hence that is where that 
plan must be discussed. 
<H5>  Prisoners, Pardons </H5>
  [San Sebastian] Honestly and, if possible, with a date, for 
how long will the prisoners be negotiable, and for how long will 
you keep the doors of rehabilitation open? 
  [Asuncion] They have not been or ever can be negotiable. 
With respect to serving sentences in full, this will be possible 
when the current legislation is changed. The Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party has that proposal in its election program, and now 
we must wait for parliament to decide -- in March, I believe -- 
on the new penal code. 
  [San Sebastian] Are you personally in favor of this? 
  [Asuncion] I, of course, must carry out my party's programs.

the truth behind the claim Damascus has made for many years that 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in 
Syria. The intelligence units have established that Damascus 
has given Ocalan a Syrian identity certificate and a new name. 
  The Syrian officials maintained during the meetings they 
held 
with their Turkish counterparts that Abdullah Ocalan is not in 
their country. That was correct because no one in Syria is 
known as Abdullah Ocalan. His name in that country is "Ahmad 
Jasim Musa." The identity certificate that was issued to him was 
signed by General 'Ali Duba, chief of the Syrian Intelligence 
Organization. 
  According to the latest report from the Turkish intelligence 
units, Ahmad Jasim Musa drives a bullet-proof vehicle that has 
red registration plates. The registration numbers on Ocalan's 
vehicle has been conveyed to all the security units and they 
have been instructed not to stop him. Meanwhile, several 
members of al-Mukhabarat, Syria's secret service organization, 
are among Ocalan's bodyguards. They accompany him on his visits 
to various cities in Syria. [passage omitted] 
  The PKK militants are obliged to inform al-Mukhabarat about 
their activities. The PKK militants in the Aleppo region are 
under the control of Brigadier General Hasan Khalluf, deputy 
chief of military intelligence. The PKK militants in the 
al-Hasakah and al-Qamishli regions are under the control of 
Colonel Muhammad Mansur, head of military intelligence in the 
two areas, and Amn al-Dawlah [state security]. Syrian officials 
accompany the PKK militants to Tel Kocak, al-Malikiyah, and 'Ayn 
Diwar on Syria's border with Iraq and help them cross into that 
country. That is within the knowledge of Mansur and al-Dawla. 
  Meanwhile, Syria issues passports and identification to the 
PKK militants who wish to travel to Europe. Those who travel 
from Europe to Syria land in Beirut first. They are then 
transported in trucks to al-Hasakah and al-Qamashli.

leader of Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, by Huseyin Gul; place and 
date not given; for part two, see item NC2222110 in previous 
Terrorism Report] 
  [Excerpts] Botan/KURD-A -- [passage omitted] [Gul] Do you 
mean to say that there will be an intensification in operations 
in Turkey? 
  [Ocalan] As an important tactical objective, it is possible 
to move the guerrillas into Turkey's rural areas. This could 
lead to important results. Also, operations in Turkey's urban 
areas could be developed enormously. Operations carried out 
specifically against tourism and economic targets in cities will 
further erode the economy. In particular, by rendering tourism 
wholly inoperative, the financial resources of the special war 
could be totally dried up. If its financial source is 
eradicated in this manner, then it will be highly difficult to 
support the army. [passage omitted] 
  Looking at our history, we can genuinely see that we have 
reached a stage where we have been getting the best results and 
asserting our military strength. The military method, which has 
exhausted itself for the state, has potential for us. Not only 
could they not inflict military defeat, elimination, breaking of 
hands, legs, and heads, we are actually living through a process 
whereby we are able to firmly stand on our feet and make our 
body and backbone unbreakable. 
  [Gul] Could we speak of the possibility of a cease-fire, or 
are there any signs of a political solution on the horizon? 
  [Ocalan] It is our existing policy to seek a political 
solution. The false political solution plan on which they have 
been working has come to light. It was published in the press 
too. They have fallen into the pitiable situation of expecting 
help from the village guards, burned-out Kurdish 
collaborationists, and some of our critics. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The question of Syria is the 
third point in Turkey's foreign policy that has aroused concern. 
Developments in domestic politics have overshadowed that 
problem. In view of that, little attention has been focused on 
whether or not President Clinton was able to influence President 
al-Asad when they met some time ago. A high-ranking official 
has said that President Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence 
reports Turkey has recently received indicate that Syria has 
seriously restricted Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah 
Ocalan's activities in that country. 
<H5>  Restrictions on Ocalan </H5>
  There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is 
reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon. 
He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day 
and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the 
PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK 
militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure 
seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. 
  Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that 
Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western 
countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems 
that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United 
States. 
  In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently 
been 
blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at 
again if a message is received from the United States. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, Press Association] </F>
  [Text] A new trans-Irish border opinion poll tonight 
confirmed an overwhelming demand for Sinn Fein and the IRA to 
renounce violence and enter political negotiations. 
  The survey--being detailed in tomorrow's Irish Independent 
newspaper and on BBC TV's On the Record--coincides with this 
weekend's Sinn Fein annual conference in Dublin. 
  It also highlighted large support for a security crackdown 
on 
all para-military groups if the terrorism continues. 
  The poll was carried out last Wednesday in the Irish 
Republic 
by Irish Marketing Surveys and on Wednesday and Thursday in 
Northern Ireland by Ulster Marketing Surveys. 
  It came at the height of growing speculation over the timing 
of the long-expected response of the IRA and their Sinn Fein 
spokesmen to the Downing Street peace declaration. 
  Earlier tonight, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made it 
clear in his keynote speech to the party conference that more 
time was required for consultations about the joint Anglo-Irish 
declaration. 
  The cross-border survey showed a 79 percent endorsement of 
the principle in the Downing Street declaration that it would be 
wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the 
freely-given consent of a majority of people in Northern Ireland. 
  And an all-Ireland figure of 76 percent--80 percent in the 
Republic and 68 percent in Northern Ireland--supported the 
decision of the London and Dublin governments to go ahead with 
new inter-party talks on Ulster's future, given that the 
republican movement has so far failed to reply to the peace 
statement. 
  Of those questioned on the southern side of the border, 94 
percent agreed with calls on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce 
violence. 
  In Northern Ireland the figure was 85 percent--87 percent of 
the Province's Protestants and 82 percent of the Catholics. 
  The security clampdown was supported by an average 75 
percent 
in the two parts of Ireland. In Ulster the move was backed by 
88 percent of the Protestants and 61 percent of the Catholics. 
  Adults over the age of 18 took part in the survey--1,053 in 
the Irish Republic and 863 in Northern Ireland, reflecting 
population and other factors.

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones, Political Editor: "Unionists Dash </F>
Major's Hopes of Ulster Peace"] 
  [Text] Government hopes of achieving a political 
settlement in Northern Ireland looked bleak last night after the 
Ulster Unionists refused to take part in talks involving Dublin. 
  Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said the 
Downing Street declaration, signed by Mr John Major, the Prime 
Minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, 11 
weeks ago, "had run its course." 
  His party, the main voice of the loyalists, said it would 
not 
engage in any new talks involving Dublin until an internal 
settlement, including a new devolved assembly for Ulster, had 
been reached. 
  The Unionists offered to continue to talk to the British 
Government and other mainstream parties in Northern Ireland. 
But Downing Street reaffirmed the Government's view that all 
those affected, including Dublin, had to be involved in talks on 
the province. 
  The Government sought to play down the rejection, 
emphasising 
that efforts to reach a settlement would continue. "We don't 
believe in the counsel of despair," said a spokesman. 
  "We recognise this is a difficult situation, but we will 
continue to talk to all the parties to try to find common 
ground." 
  The Downing Street declaration emphasised that progress 
would 
be made through the three-strand talks -- and not by a purely 
internal settlement. This was underlined by Mr Major and Mr 
Reynolds last month. 
  The hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Mr Ian Paisley 
is already boycotting talks. But the official Unionists' 
decision is a much more serious blow. 
  It was the second setback for the Government in 24 hours. 
Over the weekend it became clear at Sinn Fein's annual 
conference in Dublin that the IRA is not yet prepared to declare 
a ceasefire, raising doubts over the effectiveness of the 
Downing Street declaration. Ministers believe that the new 
hardline position by the Ulster Unionists is dictated largely by 
the approaching European elections. The party fears it could be 
outflanked by Mr Paisley' s more extreme Democratic Unionists. 
  Unveiling the Ulster Unionists' Blueprint for Stability, 
which includes a demand for a new Bill of Rights as well as a 
devolved assembly, Mr Molyneaux scorned the "summitry" by the 
two prime ministers. 
  Two initiatives were now needed, he said: "a genuine effort 
to eradicate terrorism" and moves towards "restoring democracy." 
  Speaking at a Westminster news conference, Mr Molyneaux 
said: 
"The failure of the declaration has also hideously damaged the 
Anglo-Irish Agreement. Things are never going to be the same 
again."

  [Editorial Report] The Greek press commented at length on 
the latest 17 November terrorist attack in which former National 
Bank of Greece Governor Mikhalis Vranopoulos was assassinated. 
<H5>  "Precious" Time Lost </H5>
  According to the 25 January Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, 
"precious" time was lost after the attack on Vranopoulos, 
allowing the perpetrators to run away unimpeded. In addition, 
many store owners or workers in the immediate vicinity of the 
crime scene refused to talk or alleged they "saw nothing." 
Finally, I KATHIMERINI notes that the fact that no driver 
passing by stopped to transport the victims to the nearest 
hospital is "disheartening." 
<H5>  Guilty Parties </H5>
  While questions such as "who arms the hand of 17 November" 
and "who profits at the political level from 17 November 
activities" have arisen in the wake of the Vranopoulos attack, 
their intent is to "disorient" people, writes Stamos Zoulas in 
the 26 January I KATHIMERINI. Even worse, he continues, is the 
fact that certain people cultivate the impression that "the 
existence and actions of terrorism in our country stem from 
concrete causes." This is like saying that if the "causes" are 
wiped out, terrorism will disappear: If "corruption in public 
life is wiped out, justice becomes impartial, and all social 
injustice disappears, then 17 November will necessarily put down 
its arms," Zoulas ironically notes. These individuals are 
legalizing terrorism by making it the "ultimate judge of our 
public and social life and the self-styled avenger of what it 
condemns." Such a train of thought would lead to the 
"extravagant" belief that politicians who hurl accusations at 
each other, newsmen who criticize public figures, and the legal 
system that does not intervene swiftly enough are the guilty 
parties. "Before casting the first stone on the police for its 
inability to arrest the terrorists, let us condemn the mindset 
that contributes nothing to the defeat of terrorism, but creates 
the ideal climate for rendering it endemic and long-lived in 
Greece," Zoulas concludes. 
<H5>  Older Generation Back </H5>
  According to the 27 January I KATHIMERINI, the 
"forty-something" generation has again become active in the 
20-year history of 17 November. Following the appearance of 
young people in other incidents (booby-trapped cars and bombs at 
income tax offices), antiterrorism officials believe, on the 
basis of descriptions of the perpetrators furnished by 
by-standers, that the older members of the organization have 
returned to action and to the "old 45mm gun." 
<H5>  Foreign Cooperation </H5>
  The 27 January I KATHIMERINI also cites government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos's reply to the question of whether the 
government will accept the participation of foreign secret 
services in antiterrorism activities. While stressing that the 
government believes in international cooperation to fight 
terrorism, he added that cooperation will always take place 
"within the framework of our country's national sovereignty." 
<H5>  PASOK Role Questioned </H5>
  According to Yiannis Lampsas writing in the 29 January 
Athens 
daily ELEVTHEROS TIPOS, while no one believes that 17 November 
carries out the orders of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
(PASOK), there are "deep "politico-ideological ties and mutual 
sympathy" between them. Lampsas provides the following reasons: 
  1. The terrorist organization's basic nucleus was probably 
formed by old members of the Panhellenic Liberation Movement 
(PAK), the organization that antedated PASOK, given that 
communists "prefer other forms of struggle against the bourgeois 
regime" and members of the New Democracy (ND) are the 
terrorists' main opponents. 
  2. Both PAK and PASOK maintained close ties with Third World 
regimes which "encouraged, trained, and armed all kinds of 
terrorists against the common enemy." 
  3. With the exception of Americans and former junta members, 
17 November victims always belonged to the liberal, free-market 
world, and most of them were murdered under PASOK 
administrations, notably when these governments were facing 
serious domestic problems. 
  4. PASOK opposes antiterrorist legislation and protests 
police investigations. Some of its members view terrorists as 
"social fighters." 
  5. More generally, PASOK encourages student sit-ins, blames 
policemen who defend themselves, and dismisses police officials 
with a distinguished record in the fight against narcotics. 
<H5>  Americans' Role </H5>
  The 3 February Athens weekly PONDIKI notes that according to 
some [unidentified] former ministers and police officials, 
Americans who come to Greece to provide antiterrorism assistance 
"usually ask for more information than they give." They seem to 
have integrated terrorism into Greek reality and just watch 
events, the newspaper comments. 
<H5>  Scenarios on Origins </H5>
  According to the 3 February PONDIKI, theories on the origins 
of 17 November include the following: 
  1. The terrorist organization is the creation of foreign 
secret services, which decided in 1975 to set up a "killing" 
unit in Greece for destabilization purposes. However, no such 
thing occurred, the newspaper argues, because those who believe 
this theory must also explain the number and choice of victims, 
some of whom were foreigners. 
  2. 17 November was created in 1975 by the Greek National 
Intelligence Service (EIP). However, this fails to explain why 
the first victim was an American, why PASOK was unable to 
determine the organization's origins, and why the EIP--then 
called Central Intelligence Service (KIP)--which in 1975-1981 
included a number of former junta followers, made such a move. 
In addition, the fact that the same course was followed under 
PASOK remains unexplained, PONDIKI comments. 
  The newspaper then reviews a third different scenario, under 
which: 
  1. PASOK facilitated terrorism for its eight years in power 
and never arrested a suspect even if it could do so. However, 
this allegation can easily be "stood on its head," PONDIKI 
comments, for the same is true of New Democracy (ND) in its 
years in power (1975-81 and 1990-93). 
  2. PASOK tolerated terrorism because it knows that 17 
November was founded by PAK members. While it is true that the 
terrorist organization began under the junta years and could not 
have sprung up from the Right, the PAK origin--if real--would 
mean that the party to which the assassins belonged bears the 
responsibility for the present situation: this is not 
acceptable, PONDIKI contends. 
  In closing, the newspaper notes that over the years, the 
terrorist organization had its ups and downs. Mistakes were 
made, such as Pavlos Bakoyiannis's assassination, which raised a 
"huge public outcry." There were innocent victims, following 
which 17 November gave up the use of rockets in favor of guns. 
There are also indications that one or more individuals with 
military training joined the organization, as evidenced by the 
theft of bazookas from the War Museum and rockets from the 
Sikourion base, subsequently used in "mini" military operations. 
Finally, PONDIKI concludes, there had to be a "renewal" within 
the organization, for even if its original members were in their 
20s, they are now in their riper 40s.

<F P=106> [Ulla Jepsen report: "Muslim Fundamentalists Operate From </F>
Denmark"] 
  [Text] Copenhagen -- Denmark is a base for Muslim 
fundamentalists trying to overthrow the Egyptian government and 
turn the country into an Islamic state. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, one of the leaders behind the 
fundamentalist groups in Denmark, instigates acts of terrorism 
-- including those against Danish firms and Danish tourists in 
Egypt -- from his home in the Copenhagen area. 
  He is under sentence of death for his part in the 
assassination of the Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981. 
The Egyptian state has requested his extradition from Denmark, 
but Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim has been granted political asylum in 
Denmark and cannot, therefore, be handed over to Egypt. 
  "Kill the infidels and join the fight for an Islamic state 
in 
Egypt," Islamic fundamentalists urge in mosques throughout 
Denmark. 
  For Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim and the other fundamentalists the 
purpose of the terrorism is to create economic chaos and social 
unrest in Egypt, so as to overturn President Mubarak's moderate 
government. 
  "The radical Islamic fundamentalists are dangerous, and can 
easily plan and carry out acts of terrorism from Europe," one 
Islamic expert predicts. 
  But the Danish asylum authorities have no opportunity of 
assessing whether or not those seeking asylum are members of 
international terrorist organizations. The asylum authorities 
may not check the identity of those seeking asylum either with 
Interpol or with the police in their country of origin. 
  In Egypt he is considered to be one of the leaders behind 
the 
extremist Islamic groups which, with their bases outside the 
country, attempt to overthrow the Egyptian Government and set up 
an Islamic state. He himself does not hide his links with 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic group], one of the most violent 
and fundamentalist Islamic groups in Egypt. 
  The left-wing Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI recently published 
an interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, [see p. 39 of 6 October 
1993 Terrorism Report] in which he made threats against foreign 
tourists and investments in Egypt, including Danish firms such 
as A.P. Moeller, F.L. Smidth, and Aarhus Flydedok, which operate 
in Egypt, and the 2,000 or so Danish tourists who holiday there 
each year. 
  "Tourism is a non-Islamic source of income which helps keep 
the present government in power, and foreigners have been warned 
to stay away from Egypt," Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim told the Egyptian 
paper. 
  "The radical Muslim leaders such as Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim 
living in various places in Europe and the United States pose a 
very real threat to their countries, and it is easy for them to 
send orders for actions, money, or tapes with religious 
propaganda to members of the fanatical groups in Egypt, for 
example," Hesham Mubarak, a lawyer currently writing a book on 
radical Islamic groups and their international network, told 
POLITIKEN. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is a well-known figure in fundamentalist 
circles. In 1981 he was arrested as one of the leaders of the 
banned fanatical group Jihad (Holy War), which later that year 
was behind the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. In 
1989 he succeeded in escaping while being moved with other 
prisoners. Via the Sudan and Peshawar in Pakistan, he reached 
Afghanistan where, in the same way as Sheik 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman, thought to be the brains behind the World Trade 
Center bombing, he was one of the leaders behind the Muslim 
fundamentalist volunteers who helped the Afghan Mojahidin in the 
fight against the occupying Soviet power. 
  The Egyptian authorities have requested that Denmark hand 
over Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, but he need not fear ending his days 
on Egypt's gallows. [see p. 21 of 28 December 1993 Terrorism 
Report] 
  "People who have obtained asylum in Denmark are not returned 
to their own country if there is a death sentence awaiting 
them," Justice Minister Erling Olsen said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Statement Characterized by </F>
Escalatory Tone Against Regime, Algerian Salvation Front 
Condemns Killing of El Afghani, Intercepting Its Possible 
Accusation of Informing Against Him"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
abroad yesterday condemned the Algerian security forces' killing 
last Saturday of Djaafar El Afghani, leader of the Armed Islamic 
Group [GIA]. It stressed that "there can be no solution except 
complete submission to the will of the people." 
  It is the Front's first comment on the killing of El 
Afghani, 
whose group's statements persistently criticized the approach of 
dialogue with the authorities and vehemently attacked FIS 
leaders. 
  Well-informed sources interpret the FIS condemnation of the 
GIA leader's killing as "a clear attempt to intercept any 
accusations which could be leveled at it in the future to the 
effect that it was behind his betrayal." 
  This condemnation comes while Cheikh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader 
of Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], attacked circles "claiming 
to belong to the Islamic tendency," accusing them of killing the 
preacher Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, a prominent Muslim 
Brotherhood leader. The authorities accuse the GIA of killing 
the preacher, who -- according to Cheikh Nahnah -- refused to 
issue a fatwa sanctioning acts of murder. 
  Cheikh Rabeh Kebir did not sign the FIS statement, knowing 
that he has been officially notified by the German authorities 
of the decision to ban him from pursuing political activities. 
The statement, which carried the signature "the Executive 
Committee abroad," accused the ruling regime in Algeria of 
"escalating assassination operations against innocent citizens 
throughout the homeland in the hope of terrorizing and 
intimidating people further." 
  The statement added that "the cowardly criminal operation 
carried out by the repressive authorities against the mujahid, 
leader, martyr, and Sword of Islam Djaafar and a group of his 
aides -- who were the elite of the mujahidin, heroes, and 
martyrs -- reflects the aims of the regime, which is oppressing 
the Algerian people by fire and sword. Let the regime and its 
supporters know that, whenever a leader falls in the arena of 
honor, a new leader succeeds him and follows the same line." 
  The statement pointed out that these operations come while 
the regime continues to talk about looking for negotiated 
solutions to the crisis afflicting the country, which is caused 
by the regime. 
  The statement concluded: "There can be no solution to the 
political problem in Algeria except complete submission to the 
Algerian people's will to build a just, Islamic state that will 
rid people of oppression, repression, and corruption and restore 
to them their dignity and freedom." [passage omitted] 
  Observers say that FIS statements condemning Djaafar El 
Afghani's killing may be designed to cut short the possibility 
of having an accusing finger pointed at it for revealing the GIA 
leader's whereabouts. These observers attribute the possibility 
of such an accusation against it to reports about a dialogue 
being conducted between it and the authorities and the 
possibility that the authorities may have asked it to halt 
violence in return for political concessions demanded by the FIS. 
  There are reports in Algeria to the effect that members of 
armed groups are informing against one another and that many 
members of these groups are falling as a result of this. There 
is also widespread talk that the Algerian authorities have been 
able to infiltrate the GIA. 
  Djaafar El Afghani assumed the group's leadership last year 
after its leader 'Abd-al-Haqq 'Ayayidah [as transliterated] was 
arrested in Morocco and handed over to Algeria. Al-'Ayayidah 
has still not been tried. 
  AL-HAYAH yesterday received a statement from the GIA in 
which 
it announced the death of its leader, pledging to continue the 
"jihad." It also stressed that it "will -- God willing -- 
continue its jihad until God proclaims this religion or until we 
die for the sake of it. The conspiracies of the Jews, 
Christians, and apostates will not change it (the group). Nor 
will the sayings of the atheists who have sold their consciences 
to the East and the West affect its determination." It also 
said that El Afghani "is not the first leader to fall, nor will 
he be the last. It is God's will, and this is our road to make 
this religion prevail -- the road of jihad and martyrdom. There 
is no other road." 
  With regard to the security situation, FIS sources have said 
that six Army personnel were killed and 19 wounded the day 
before yesterday in an ambush set up by "mujahidin" in the 
mountains around al-Qall [as transliterated] city the day before 
yesterday. The sources said that security forces "took revenge 
against unarmed citizens, killing al-Sayyid Kebir (60), uncle of 
Cheikh Rabeh Kebir." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>
  [Text] It would make a great story for a novel by Ian 
Fleming, the creator of secret agent James Bond. Arab 
terrorists buy weapons on the Brazilian-Paraguayan border to 
perpetrate attacks that jeopardize the peace-seeking process 
between Israel and the PLO. This is not just the product of the 
imagination of an author. About 15 days ago foreign 
intelligence services agents in Foz de Iguacu (Parana) detected 
five Arabs, presumably Palestinians from Lebanon, contacting 
local weapon traffickers. They wanted to buy plastic 
explosives, and AR-15 and FAL rifles. 
  News of the presence of these Arabs reached Brasilia. 
Brazilian intelligence services and Federal Police were placed 
on a state of alert. There is fear that an attack like the one 
on 17 March 1992 against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires -- 
which resulted in 29 deaths -- may take place. Brazilian and 
foreign intelligence experts are working on the theory that 
fundamentalists linked to the Hizballah -- Party of God, a 
pro-Iranian organization headquartered in Lebanon -- are trying 
to obstruct the peace-seeking plan between Israelis and 
Palestinians. An attack would disqualify the PLO as a reliable 
interlocutor. Iran and some Arab extremist organizations are 
against any sort of agreement between Palestinians and the state 
of Israel. 
  It is believed the five individuals may have entered 
Brazilian territory through Argentina or Paraguay, taking 
advantage of the Argentine-Brazil-Paraguay border region and, 
especially, of the possible logistic support they may have 
obtained from members of the important Arab community in the 
region. 
  Federal Police Director Colonel Wilson Romao told ISTOE that 
"this is a potentially explosive situation and we are taking the 
necessary measures to identify these five individuals and 
prevent them from using Brazil as a springboard for 
international terrorism." Romao confirmed that since January he 
has been receiving reports from the border region on movements 
of suspicious members of the local Arab community. Romao said 
the terrorist threat is real in Foz de Iguacu. He asserted: 
"There are all the necessary facilities there to acquire weapons 
and the flights that may be used for terrorist actions." 
  The existence of links between terrorists and sectors of the 
Arab communities in the south of Brazil was established when the 
intelligence services discovered that Quarai town in Rio Grande 
do Sul was used as a logistic base for the attack in Buenos 
Aires. An extremist cell was established here years ago to 
collect funds from the Arab communities established in Rio 
Grande do Sul and Parana States to finance sabotage operations 
against Israeli or Jewish targets in Argentina and Uruguay. 
ISTOE found out that weeks before the attack on the Israeli 
Embassy in Buenos Aires, the bodies of a Palestinian couple from 
Jordan were found inside a vehicle that went over a precipice in 
the town of Banhado do Taim (Rio Grande do Sul). The police 
found a large quantity of gold bars with the bodies. The case, 
at that time, was regarded as an unfortunate story of gold 
smuggling. It was even said that the gold belonged to the 
well-known dollar trader Najum Turner, who was involved in the 
so-called "Uruguay Operation," to cover a loan for Fernando 
Collor de Mello's electoral campaign. Turner, who is Jewish, 
was allegedly dealing with gold on the black market for Arab 
clients, unaware that those funds could be used to finance 
terrorist operations against Israel.

  [Text] Is it an operation to send the fighters away 
preparatory to beginning the peace phase or is it in preparation 
for external military operations? Many security circles are 
trying to answer this question after noticing that Hizballah has 
started sending its groups and active cadres in the external 
operations division to Brazil and some other Latin American 
countries. It was learned that these groups joined bases the 
party has established there following a tour of these countries 
by two Hizballah officials who traveled there to make the 
necessary arrangements for receiving and settling the Hizballah 
men.

the hijackers were demanding to fly to Italy and told airport 
officials to re-fuel the plan. The Saudi ambassador to Nairobi 
had rushed to the scene, the Saudi Embassy here said, but gave

Officials of the airline in Nairobi are reported to have 
refused to talk to the press. 
  A KTN reporter says that 130 Ethiopians were aboard the 
plane, an A-300/600 [as heard] Airbus. The Ethiopians were 
being deported from Jiddah to Addis Ababa. Also on board were 
nine international passengers. 
  Three hijackers are reported to have commandeered the airbus 
to Nairobi. One hijacker disembarked with the passengers, while 
the other two are reported to be still aboard the plane. The 
hijackers' nationalities were not immediately known.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, March 8 (AFP) -- The hijacking of a 
Saudi airliner forced to land here while flying from Ethiopia to 
Saudi Arabia ended late Tuesday, the Saudi embassy said. 
  No details were immediately available about how the siege of 
the plane ended, but unconfirmed reports said security forces 
stormed the plane. [passage omitted] 
  A Saudi embassy official had said one of the three hijackers 
was a woman and that the trio were demanding the plane be 
refuelled to fly to London.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 8 March (AFP) [dateline as received] -- 
Kenyan police Wednesday [9 March] said that two Ethiopians who 
hijacked a Saudi airliner to Nairobi faced trial in Kenya, but 
would not confirm reports that they were illegal immigrants 
expelled from Saudi Arabia. One of the hijackers, a man who was 
injured when police captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed 
with an imitation pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed 
woman with him was seized unhurt. 
  The Saudia airline company stated that some 140 Ethiopian 
passengers who had been freed before police ended the hijack bid 
were flown Wednesday to Addis Ababa on a special flight. Press 
reports Wednesday said that the hijackers were illegal 
immigrants and added that they had a third accomplice who 
managed to merge with other passengers, but a police spokesman 
said this was "speculation." [passage omitted] 
  Most of the passengers were Ethiopian Muslims who had been 
on 
pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca and whose Saudi 
visas had expired, diplomatic sources said. A number of them 
had tried illegally to remain in Saudi Arabia but had been 
expelled, the sources added. Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya 
Ofato Alew told AFP that embassy staff had played no part in the 
negotiations and were not officially informed of the affair.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 8 March (AFP) -- Kenyan police have 
arrested one man and three women, all Ethiopians, charged with 
hijacking a Saudi Arabian airliner to Nairobi on Tuesday, a 
police spokesman said Thursday [10 March]. On Wednesday, the 
police had said that two Ethiopians, a man and a woman, faced 
trial in Kenya. 
  One of the hijackers, a man who was injured when police 
captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed with an imitation 
pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed woman with him was 
seized unhurt. One of the other women was arrested just 
afterwards, while security forces detained a third who had 
managed to merge with some 140 Ethiopian passengers freed before 
police ended the hijack bid, police disclosed Thursday. 
  The man's alleged accomplices named him only as Fuad and 
said 
that he was a former Air Force officer who had been expelled 
from Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia, but did not want to return, 
police said. The women were named by police as Sofia Kadir 
Mohamed, Fatma Daya and Muna Abdir Kadir. Press reports have 
said that the hijackers were illegal immigrants to Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Did State Police Official Spy for </F>
Terrorists in Libya?"] 
  [Text] The Hochenbichler case is escalating: What did the 
high-ranking State Police official have to do with the Libyan 
intelligence service and the East German "Commercial 
Coordination Empire"? 
  Hochenbichler, who is seriously ill [with cancer of the 
throat], still denies that he spied for a GDR embassy secretary. 
However, Interior Ministry investigators speak of a "dense 
network of evidence." Investigations are now extending in the 
direction of Libya. Hochenbichler reportedly had close contacts 
with a Libyan intelligence service agent. For many years 
al-Qadhdhafi's capital of Tripoli was considered the point of 
departure for sensational attacks. This ranged from OPEC 
terrorist "Carlos" to the jumbo crash in Lockerbie. 
  The Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BKA] has a Stasi document in its possession. The 
document, which is labeled "top secret" and has the file number 
000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A 
brief excerpt: 
  -- creation of logistical bases in the GDR capital with the 
inclusion of GDR citizens; 
  -- promotion of travel by liaison people of the Carlos group 
to the FRG and other West European countries; 
  -- efforts to acquire weapons, explosives, money, and 
information; 
  -- inspiration for acts of violence of armed struggle, 
including individual actions, attacks, etc. against the 
imperialist policy of the United States, the Zionists, and the 
clique around al-Sadat. 
  Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad, 
and in Tripoli. 
<H5>  Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting </H5>
  To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via 
Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a 
Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign 
espionage service "HVA" (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main 
Administration), because the most important counterespionage 
activities of western security authorities went across 
Hochenbichler's desk. 
  The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of 
the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former 
GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine 
Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the 
Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's 
office thinks that both played a central role in the "Koko" 
empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency 
acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multi-digit billion 
sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via 
Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in 
Germany. 
  The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all, 
he was able to welcome "Red Fini" at his private party on his 
50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. "Poor Fini," 
the official pitied her, must now "invest millions in lawyers." 
Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links 
Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out 
that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko 
trial files. 
  Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the 
Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of 
Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of 
this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief 
Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an 
"unofficial employee" of the HVA "for decades." "In particular 
in Austria" he was working "unofficially."

  [Text] Larnaca (CNA)--A phone call saying that a bomb had 
been planted on a plane going to Vienna delayed the flight of 
Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special representative on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  An unidentified man who spoke in Greek called the duty 
officer at Larnaca Airport and told him that "there is a bomb on 
the plane that will fly to Vienna." 
  The Austrian Airlines flight had just landed at the airport 
coming from Cairo. It was supposed to leave for Vienna at 1435 
[1235 GMT] today. 
  Police inspected the aircraft but found nothing suspicious. 
Following a careful inspection of the luggage and the 
passengers, which lasted for approximately one hour, the plane 
left at 1505 [1305 GMT] for its destination. 
  The U.S. coordinator handled the situation with humor. Lamb 
and the U.S. Embassy spokesman who was accompanying him remained 
in the VIP room during the inspection.

  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Two hijackers, Zhang 
Daxing and Chen Jiangfu, were recently tried by the Intermediate 
People's Court in Hangzhou city, capital of Zhejiang Province, 
and given different imprisonment terms, according to the Supreme 
People's Court here today. 
  The two were convicted of trying to hijack a plane from 
China 
Eastern Airlines. Chief criminal Zhang Daxing, a self-employed 
businessman, was sentenced to life imprisonment with his 
political rights deprived for life, and his accomplice Chen 
Jiangfu, a self- employed tailor, was sentenced to ten years 
behind bars with his political rights deprived for one year. 
  On January 28, 1994, Zhang Daxing, a native of Taicang 
county 
in Jiangsu Province, and Chen Jiangfu, a native of Wujin county 
in Jiangsu, bought air tickets from Shanghai to Hangzhou for the 
following day. 
  Zhang told Chen his intention and detailed plan to hijack 
the 
passenger plane to Taiwan and showed him a letter of blackmail 
to be used in the move. 
  On January 29, the two men got on the airplane, flight 5513, 
of China Eastern Airlines. Soon after the plane took off, Zhang 
got up and declared with the letter that the plane was hijacked, 
threatening to explode it if it refused to fly to Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, Chen kept an eye on people on board, following 
Zhang's orders. 
  The two hijackers were subdued and arrested after the 
airplane landed at the airport in Hangzhou. 
  They were convicted by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's 
Court in its first ruling according to law. They pleaded guilty 
and did not appeal to the higher people's court. 
  A spokesman of the Supreme People's Court pointed out today 
that hijacking civil airplanes is a grave crime as it endangers 
the safety of passengers and their property, adding that 
criminals should be sternly punished according to law.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Maurice Cler in Noumea: "New Caledonia: </F>
Two Gun Caches Found in Noumea"] 
  [Text] Several dozen handguns, assault rifles, heavy 
weapons, explosives, a large stockpile of various-caliber 
ammunition, radio equipment -- all adding up to a veritable 
arsenal fit for urban guerrilla warfare -- have been seized by 
Noumea police. The seizures were made possible by searches 
conducted as part of an investigation into the theft of a number 
of passports in the premises of the General Regulation and 
Administration Directorate (DIRAG) at the High Commission of the 
Republic in New Caledonia. 
  In a communique, the state prosecutor said that the 
operation 
stemmed from the arrest, in France, of "two Caledonians in 
possession of securities stolen in Noumea as well as forged 
identity papers." Investigations revealed "the existence of two 
caches supposedly containing merchandise of shady origin. 
Investigators discovered the booty of several burglaries 
committed in the territory." 
  Most administrative documents stolen from the DIRAG, as well 
as about 10 handguns, 50 rifles, and various explosive 
substances, have been recovered during a flagrante delicto 
procedure. Three people are being held for questioning and 
investigations are in progress in order to ascertain the exact 
origin of the seized items as well as the identity and motives 
of the persons behind all this. 
  According to various sources and witness accounts from 
residents of the area (the Ducos industrial area and Ouemo 
residential community) -- including a video filmed unknown to 
the investigators and broadcast by television station RFO -- 
there were also heavy weapons, two-way radios, and ammunition 
among the weapons seized. Parts of the arsenal reportedly came 
from the United States and were paid for through the sale of 
passports which were part of the "administrative documents taken 
in DIRAG's premises" (2,000 passports had been stolen there). 
Worth pointing out however is the fact that the number of 
handguns and rifles indicated in the state prosecutor's 
communique match the number of arms stolen on 2 December 1986 in 
a local department store. 
  The exact circumstances of the arrest of the "two 
Caledonians" have not been divulged. Sources close to the 
investigators say the two men were arrested in Metz on their way 
back from Luxembourg, where they had attempted to negotiate a 
400,000-French-franc treasury bill. 
  The bill came from a burglary committed in New Caledonia. 
One of the two men quickly made a confession and, probably to 
imbue his activities with a political dimension, reportedly 
confessed having been party to bombings in Noumea and told 
investigators about the two caches of weapons and war equipment.

  [Summary] A locomotive was damaged when it hit a mine 
planted on a bridge between the Hat Yai and Chana rail stations. 
The locomotive was on its way to pull a train with a load of 
rock from Chana back to Hat Yai. 
  The incident took place at 0506 today in Ban Thung Phra, 
Tambon Paching, Chana District, Songkhla Province, only three 
kilometers from the Chana station. The explosion damaged the 
front of the locomotive and the tracks. The driver and engineer 
were unhurt. 
  Authorities found two letters from the PULO [Pattani United 
Liberation Organization], one written in southern dialect and 
the other in Thai, claiming responsibility for the incident. 
They want the government to explain the motive behind the 
recent torching of schools in the south which, they said, was 
not the work of the PULO.

  [Text] Government agencies are reportedly split in their 
opinions as to who was responsible for Tuesday's railway bomb 
attack in Songkhla. 
  Well-informed Interior Ministry sources disclosed that 
Fourth 
Army Region Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya has told the 
Interior Ministry that "a third party" was responsible for the 
attack. 
  However, the police and the southern authority have 
submitted 
preliminary reports to the Interior Ministry blaming southern 
separatist bandits. 
  The sources said Lt-Gen Kitti, in his report to the Interior 
Ministry, said the bomb attack was not the work of members of 
Pattani United Liberation Organisation [PULO] but that of a 
"third hand" who wanted to create more problems for the 
government. 
  However, Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre 
Director Wisut Singkhachonworakun and the police said PULO 
separatists were behind the attack. 
  Mr Wisut said it has yet to be established which faction of 
the group was responsible for the attack on the railroad track 
in Chana District of Songkhla Province. 
  Local officials have been instructed to gather information 
to 
find out if this faction is a new or old group of the PULO, he 
said. 
  Mr Wisut said no promises had been made to the separatist 
bandits, as suggested by some news reports. It was reported 
that the group claimed in a letter left at the scene of the 
attack that the Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre 
had promised the bandits they would speed up the investigation 
into the torching of schools in the south last year. 
  He said the centre would try to prevent a similar recurrence 
but admitted that the task would be difficult. 
  Police Department deputy chief Phongamat Amattayakun said it 
was believed that the separatists might have received support 
from overseas. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Phongamat said local politicians 
should be able to help play a role in solving the problem of 
subversive activities in the south as they were familiar with 
local problems. 
  "The incident (the bomb attack) is a political problem. The 
local politicians should know it well and should help solve it," 
Pol Gen Phongamat said. 
  Meanwhile, Deputy Police Department Chief for Crime 
Suppression Phot Bunyachinda yesterday ordered security to be 
beefed up at public buildings and bus and train terminals after 
Tuesday's attack. 
  In his order to the regional police headquarters in the 
south, policemen are to set up highway checkpoints and conduct 
random searches of vehicles of suspicious-looking people around 
the clock to prevent another attack. 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled 
out speculation that the bomb attack at Songkhla was designed to 
discredit him. 
  Gen Chawalit said the police have submitted a preliminary 
report but he would have to wait for a detailed investigation 
and analysis to determine if the attack was really conducted by 
the PULO, as stated in the letter placed at the blast site. 
  Gen Chawalit said it was probably the work of certain 
movements that have been operating for 40-50 years already, 
which have begun using weapons. [passage omitted] 
  Gen Chawalit said it is noticeable that the groups are 
beginning to come out of the woodwork. "The people should 
carefully watch their movements without being shaken about it." 
  The Interior Minister said one should understand that the 
bomb blasts have occurred in many places and would continue to 
happen because there are many kinds of people in society, where 
there are different kinds of conflicts, both concerning personal 
issues and business. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to a public relations official of Nakhon 
Ratchasima Province, at about 0300 today an explosion was heard 
at the house of Sawai Phrammani, permanent secretary of the 
Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, which is situated at No. 287 
on Mitraphap- Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai Road, Tambon Munwai, 
Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province. There was an 
explosion outside the house fence near the gate. About 10 
minutes afterwards several rounds of gunfire were fired at the 
house. The explosion caused minor damage to the fence. A 
one-foot timed detonating wire was found at the site. The 
damage was estimated at about 1,000 baht. Five shots hit the 
house -- three at the windows and two on the wall. Two bullets 
were found and an investigation showed they were .38 caliber and 
fired from about 20 meters outside the fence. There were no 
casualties. Motives for the incident are under investigation. 
  Sawai told correspondents that the incident occurred at 0300 
this morning. He said the damage was slight, estimated at 1,000 
baht. Police are investigating the incident. He said he was in 
Bangkok when the incident occurred and, therefore, knows very 
little. Correspondents will have to ask his son who was at the 
residence when the incident occurred. Sawai said he has no 
comment on whether the motive was political or personal.

  [Text] Santiago, 3 Mar (EFE) -- The Latin America and 
Caribbean countries are making progress toward the establishment 
of national authorities that will prevent the production, 
transportation, and trade of chemical weapons in the area. 
  The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the 
documents produced by the last regional seminar on this subject, 
which was held in Santiago last September. 
  The report stresses that each country must establish a 
national authority that will prohibit in their respective 
territories or in any place under their control the existence of 
chemical weapons, trade in elements for their manufacturing, or 
research to develop this kind of war materiel. 
  The documents point out that countries like Argentina, Cuba, 
Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela are concerned with preventing 
impediments to economic and technological development in the 
area, and with establishing solid bases for trade in chemical 
substances not suitable for war use.

  [Excerpts] Investigative Police on 9 March at noon finally 
arrested Rosa Ester Vargas, the original mujer metralleta 
[submachine gun woman], who is regarded as the most dangerous 
subversive in the Lautaro group. She was arrested in the 
country's southern section with two other people. She was 
transferred today to a Civilian Police post under strict 
security measures. [passage omitted] 
  Vargas participated mainly in attacks on banks. Police 
reported her arrest to Special Judge (Arnoldo Ereise), who

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Mar (EFE) -- Authorities 
reported that at least five people were injured today, Sunday, 
when two unidentified people on a motorcycle threw a bomb into 
the "Rancho Tropical" pavilion in Barranquilla, northern 
Colombia. Senator Fuad Char Abdala had just left the scene when 
the bomb exploded. According to the polls, Fuad Char Abdala is 
the Liberal Party candidate who will receive the most votes in 
the 13 March legislative elections. Char Abdala had presided 
over the closing ceremony for his political campaign at the 
aforementioned location. 
  The "Rancho Tropical" in southern Barranquilla was destroyed 
by the fire sparked by the bomb. Owner Guillermo Min told the 
police that he had no enemies, thus he believes that the attack 
was aimed at Char Abdala. The senator was the development 
minister between 1988 and 1990 and now hopes to be reelected to 
the Senate. 
  Fortunately the bomb was thrown 30 minutes after the 
political event had ended, and the liberal leader's followers 
had already left the scene. The five people who were injured 
sustained minor cuts when several windows were broken. The 
individuals were taken to a medical center, where it was 
determined that none had suffered serious injuries.

  [Text] Agents from the Prosecutor General's Office and the 
Bogota Metropolitan Police yesterday uncovered an ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] plan to form a popular militia group in 
southern Bogota to meddle in the business sector and spread 
their ideological work. 
  Authorities raided a home in Las Delicias neighborhood where 
they reportedly found several pamphlets urging cooperation with 
the rebels and planning intimidation and extortion projects for 
various area businessmen. Seemingly, the ELN militia in Bogota 
would try to force people to contribute money, which would 
guarantee their security. [no beginning quotation mark as 
published] Three people were arrested in the operation, in 
addition to the seizure of Venezuelan arms and ammunition, as 
well as the pamphlets. 
  Authorities increased operations to try to break up the ELN 
plan and at the same time guarantee the fulfillment of a 
proposal by Ciudad Bolivar militias, who offered to demobilize 
and get their members to rejoin civilian life the way militias 
have been negotiating in Medellin.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Mar (DPA) -- Colombian police 
have prevented a group of communist guerrillas from detonating a 
bomb at the Justice Palace in the southern city of Florencia. 
Had the bomb exploded, it would have caused significant damage. 
Police spokesmen indicated that the attack was aborted as a 
result of capturing six subversives who were preparing a 20-kg 
bomb a short distance from the building where the Florencia 
justice courts operate. Florencia is the capital of Caqueta 
Department. 
  The guerrillas, apparently Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia members, were captured after the police defused a car 
bomb at the airport in the southwestern city of Cali last night. 
According to General Jose Reyes, commander of Cali's 
metropolitan police, the car bomb, manufactured with 14 kg of 
dynamite, was parked near the "Alfonso Bonilla Aragaon" airport 
by urban guerrilla cells. 
  Beginning a month ago, subversive groups increased their 
terrorist actions to impede next Sunday's parliamentary 
elections, specifically by kidnapping mayors and congressional 
candidates, ambushing soldiers and police, and attacking towns.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional guerrilla activities and clashes with 
government military units monitored through 9 March. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  FARC, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, 42d Front 
guerrillas kidnapped French citizens Stephan Delerce, 24, a 
teacher, and Sylvie Demouline, 25, a nurse, in a rural area in 
La Macarena Municipality, Meta Department. In an unrelated 
case, Linares Municipality, Narino Department, Mayor Gerardo 
Idelfonso Jurado Calpa was kidnapped on 1 March by ELN, Army of 
National Liberation, guerrillas on the road between Linares and 
Samaniego. Municipal contractor Hermes Diaz was also kidnapped 
along with the mayor. The guerrillas' message read: "The 
mayor's kidnapping is politically motivated. Do not fear for 
his life, which we shall respect." In yet another case, about 
30 heavily armed FARC guerrillas interrupted a meeting between 
Venadillo Mayor Alfonso Zarate Vargas and Piloto peasants. The 
guerrillas addressed the villagers and asked them not to vote 
for "enemies of the people." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 9a) 
  A three-year-old girl died on 2 March in crossfire between 
FARC guerrillas and the Army in Paloquemao on the road between 
Isnos and Paletara, Huila Department. The Army's Magdalena 
Battalion surprised the guerrillas when they were about to set 
up a road block. In a separate incident, Guerrilla Coordinating 
Board members set a bus on fire on 2 March in reprisal for the 
owner's alleged collaboration with the Armed Forces. The bus 
operated on the Bucaramanga-Barrancabermeja route. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 p 8a) 
  Urban guerrillas on motorcycles took advantage of the 
political campaign in Cali to attack several political 
headquarters and a police station. Three policemen on duty were 
seriously wounded. There were two other attacks on political 
centers, but no one was injured. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 7 Mar 94) 
  At 1740 on 7 March about 100 ELN guerrillas attacked and 
destroyed the police headquarters in Tasco. The policemen on 
duty bravely defended citizens for four hours. One policeman 
was killed during the clash, and two cadets were wounded. In 
addition to the police station, the local library, the 
registrar's office, the municipal offices, and the court and all 
its files were destroyed. The guerrillas seemingly suffered no 
casualties. (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in 
Spanish 1200 GMT 8 Mar 94) 
  At 0540 on 8 March two high-power bombs exploded in Pereira 
and Dos Quebradas. It seems the target was Senator Juan 
Guillermo Angel's political center in downtown Pereira, but the 
presence of guards forced the terrorists to place the bomb 
across the street outside Citibank. In Dos Quebradas the target 
was the offices of congressional candidate Rafael Amador. No 
personal injuries were reported, only property damage. 
Meanwhile, in Cali, security was increased after a car bomb 
with 14 kg of dynamite and plans for various political centers 
was found near the Alfonso Bonilla Aragon Airport. Authorities 
blame the Guerrilla Coordinating Board. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 8 Mar 94)

  [Text] The Army Information Office has reported that 
terrorists of the self-styled Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity (URNG) attacked the Aczumbal patrol base in Quiche while 
several UN Human Rights delegates were boarding a light airplane. 
  The source added that the airplane, registration TG-CAC and 
piloted by Gerardo Poitevan, carried 18 delegates, including Dr. 
Sergio Viva Scheel, a UN human rights consultant. This fact was 
later corroborated by Hugo Leon Mejia del Aguila, the human 
rights office assistant in Nebaj, Quiche. 
  The visitors witnessed the attack and saw how the rebels 
fired indiscriminately without regard for the fact that 
civilians were present in a flagrant violation of human rights, 
the Army report states. 
  The Guatemalan Army reported that this attack shows once 
again the guerrillas' lack of respect for the sacred right to 
life. After the rebel attack, the visiting delegations traveled 
without further incidents. The delegates did say they would 
report the event at the international level because the URNG's 
criminal action exposed its lack of political willingness to 
promote peace, the report concludes.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 6 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Official sources 
confirmed today at least two propaganda bombs from the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), whose leadership 
is negotiating peace with the government, exploded in the past 
few hours in this city leaving no victims. 
  The National Police Press Office told ACAN-EFE the explosive 
devices, filled with leaflets from the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), 
one of four organizations that make up the URNG, detonated in 
two Guatemala City zones. 
  The source said the leaflets from the FAR, an armed group 
operating in the northern region under the leadership of 
Commander Pablo Monsanto, marked its "32 years of revolutionary 
struggle." 
  Several unidentified people dynamited the foundations of the 
San Juan bridge, which is located at km 20 of the Atlantic-bound 
highway, early this morning. The incident, besides causing 
property damage, created serious traffic jams. 
  The Army dispatched a delegation to the site to investigate 
if the guerrillas perpetrated the attack, which destroyed the 
bridge, and to estimate property damage. 
  The terrorist attack and the bomb explosions are occurring 
as 
the government and guerrillas are meeting in Mexico to end the 
oldest internal armed conflict in the region.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] Official spokespersons for the Army Information 
and Press Department [DIDE] have blamed the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity) for a terrorist attack early 
Sunday morning on the route to the Atlantic area. 
  [Begin recording] Reporter: What information do 
you have on the explosion at the bridge over the San Juan River? 
  Unidentified DIDE spokesperson: Once more the URNG 
has attacked Guatemalan society. This time they have blown up 
the San Juan Bridge located at the 20-kilometer marker on the 
highway to the Atlantic area. 
  For the time being, the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers 
is 
working in the area to put a Bailey bridge in place. This 
Bailey bridge costs 2,530,562 quetzales, and repairs to the 
bridge that was blown up will cost approximately 5 million 
quetzales. This ungrateful action by the URNG will cost 
Guatemalans 7,530,652 quetzales. 
  In addition, the action involves costs in the economic, 
business, and transportation sectors, as well as the threat and 
danger posed to the Guatemalan people at the time of the 
explosion. The Guatemalan people are still running a risk while 
the bridge is being repaired. 
  Reporter: What type of explosives were used this 
time? 
  DIDE spokesperson: The information we have is that 
strong dynamite charges were used. 
  Reporter: How long will it take the Army engineers 
to repair the damage? 
  DIDE spokesperson: In this case, the URNG destroys 
while the Army builds. The Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers 
is setting up the Bailey bridge at this time. Traffic will be 
restored at approximately 1700 today, but it will take another 
48 hours for the bridge to be fully operational. 
  Reporter: Why did the URNG blow up this bridge? 
  DIDE spokesperson: Right now we don't know. I 
don't think that is really important. What is important is 
that with this action, the URNG is showing how much respect it 
has for Guatemalans' human rights. 
  Reporter: What do you think of the URNG blowing up 
this bridge in Guatemala while holding peace talks in Mexico? 
  DIDE spokesperson: This is very contradictory. 
While it is attending negotiations and holding talks for the 
benefit of all Guatemalans, at the same time it is acting 
against our society. The truth is that it is very regrettable. 
Guatemala is no longer willing to tolerate such actions. 
Actually, the damage to our country goes beyond all estimates.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has condemned 
yesterday's terrorist act that destroyed the bridge over the San 
Juan River. De Leon Carpio said he did not want to think that 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] staged the 
attack because if they did, no one can rely on their political 
willingness to achieve peace in Guatemala. 
  The president confirmed that the damage has been estimated 
at 
1 million quetzals, including the demolition of the structure, 
installation of a Bailey bridge today, and construction of a new 
bridge.

<F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LIBRE special correspondent Henry </F>
Hernandez Marroquin] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Pablo Monsanto, commander of the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), said that 
retired Generals Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, Francisco Ortega 
Menaldo, and Roberto Perussina might be responsible for Sunday's 
dynamite attack on the San Juan River bridge, located at 
kilometer 20 on the Atlantic coast highway. 
  Monsanto denied that the URNG was responsible for the 
explosion, adding that the URNG has no men in the area and 
therefore could not participate in that terrorist attack. The 
rebel commander said that in an attack of this type, one cannot 
rule out the participation of criminal groups who seek to stop 
the peace dialogue, and they might be linked to the retired 
military men, who do not want to see an end to the 33 years of 
warlike conflict in Guatemala. 
  For a long time now, Monsanto added, the previously 
mentioned 
military men have caused divisions in the Army, and therefore, 
one cannot ignore their interest in the suspension of peace 
talks between the URNG and the government. Monsanto referred to 
the case of Quilo Ayuso, who during his farewell ceremony at the 
Polytechnic Institute, pointed out there was division among the 
military forces.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Defense Minister Matio Enriquez said 
in response to the rebels' claims that the military might have 
perpetrated the attack on the San Juan Bridge, located on the 
Atlantic coast highway: "The only thing I can say is that I 
cannot conceive of anything as absurd as the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity] communique" on the San Juan Bridge 
attack. 
  He reiterated that the military had exerted itself to 
restore 
traffic along that important highway; adding he does not believe 
law-abiding people are capable of perpetrating terrorist attacks 
like the most recent one. He also pointed out that the URNG 
admitted on several occasions it considers bridges, electric 
towers, or GUATEL [Guatemalan Telecommunications Enterprise] 
pylons as military targets. "I do not believe the military or 
any other Guatemalan group could created another terrorist 
faction because we are genuinely striving to achieve peace 
rather than to increase poverty and polarization," he added.

<F P=106> [DESCO Special Report No 32: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] During the month of December, political violence 
generated 58 subversive attacks causing the deaths of 34 
persons. The attacks increased by 22 in comparison with the 
November figure but, fortunately, the death toll declined by 
eight. Of the total victims, 16 belonged to the civilian sector, 
12 were presumed subversives, four were members of the Police 
Forces [FFPP], and two were from the Armed Forces [FFAA]. 
  December was marked by two commemorative dates, which were 
the occasions of heightened Shining Path [SL] activity. The 
first was another birthday of Abimael Guzman, followed by the 
SL's promised celebration of the centennial of Mao Tse-tung's 
birth. They occurred at the beginning and end of the month, 
respectively. 
  Lima again ranked first insofar as attacks were concerned. A 
total of 37 acts of political violence (64 percent) were 
committed in the capital: that is, 17 more acts than in the 
previous month. 
  A day before Abimael Guzman's birthday, the SL's caused a 
minor blackout in the capital and in other zones of the country, 
sabotaging part of the Mantaro interconnected system for this 
purpose. In conjunction with the blackout, the subversives 
detonated some explosives in at least three Lima districts. 
  Ranking second for attacks was the Northern regional 
committee, with 10 subversive acts (17 percent). The number of 
attacks rose by seven compared with the previous month's figure. 
Three of these acts involved confrontations between the forces 
of order and the subversive columns. Two of these clashes 
occurred in the Chavin region, and the third in Sanchez Carrion 
Province, in the La Libertad sierra region. 
  The Central regional committee ranked third, with five 
attacks (9 percent): the same number of acts of political 
violence as during November. Two of these incidents involved 
assaults upon vehicles on highways, another was a confrontation, 
the fourth was sabotage against high voltage towers, and the 
last, a selective assassination. 
  Fourth place for attacks was tied between the Jungle and 
Southern regions, each of which had two acts (3 percent). In the 
Jungle the attacks declined by six, and in the South they 
increased by two. 
  Last place for attacks was taken by the Principal region, 
with one subversive act involving sabotage against electric 
power facilities. 
  As for victims, the Lima regional committee also ranked 
first, with 17 persons killed (50 percent). Two of these deaths 
were selective assassinations of popular leaders: one, a member 
of the Huayacan patrols, and the other, a general secretary of a 
human settlement in Chorrillos. 
  However, the incident with the most bloodshed occurred 
during 
the attack on the Bank of the Nation branch in El Agustino, in 
which three policemen, five civilians, and one subversive were 
killed. 
  Ranking second for victims was the Northern regional 
committee, with eight (24 percent). Five of these deaths were 
Shining Path casualties in a confrontation with a police patrol 
in Mariscal Luzuriaga Province. In an invasion, the subversives 
assassinated a lieutenant governor as well. 
  The Central regional committee ranked third, with seven 
victims (20 percent). Six of these deaths occurred during a 
confrontation between an Army patrol and an MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] group in La Merced. Five subversives and 
one soldier were killed in the clash. 
  The Jungle region ranked last, with two deaths (6 percent). 
One of the incidents was the subversives' assassination of the 
wife of a municipal councilman from Amarilis, and the other was 
the death of a member of the police at the hands of an MRTA 
group.

Grande, Corazon de Jesus, Chaglia, Las Palmas, Cayumba, 
Chinchavito and other villages of the Mariano Damaso District, 
which is regarded as the second Shining Path's stronghold in the 
Upper Huallaga zone. They gave the authorities many weapons, 
grenades, communication equipments, and a large quantity of 
subversive propaganda. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 22 Feb 94 p

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
papers monitored through 22 February. 
  On 4 February, 84 repentant Shining Path "terrorists," 
including 16 women, surrendered to the Cayumba police post near 
Tingo Maria. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 5 Feb 94 p A3) 
  An Army patrol on 5 February killed two Shining Path 
"terrorists" during their group's ambush of a bus in a place 
known as Gargahuain, Chavin District, in Huari Province. The 
patrol also seized many weapons and ammunition that had been in 
the "terrorists'" possession. The plainclothes soldiers were 
travelling on a passenger bus with the objective of preventing 
any attack by the criminals. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 6 
Feb 94 p 14) 
  On 1 February Shining Path "terrorists" ambushed a peasant 
defense patrol made up of Ashaninka Indians, killing two of 
them, in the township of Saniveni, Satipo Province. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p A12) 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate, Dincote, on 10 
February presented to the press nine "terrorists" who were 
members of the Shining Path People's Aid of Peru organization. 
Their arrest prevented a series of bomb attacks in Lima. (Lima 
EL PERUANO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p A3) 
  The Armed Forces Joint Command on 16 February reported that 
Army personnel in Puno Department had over the past few days 
arrested seven alleged Shining Path "terrorists" and seized 
weapons of various calibers, ammunition, explosive devices, 
military uniforms, and subversive propaganda. (Lima EXPRESO in 
Spanish 17 Feb 94 p A14) 
  On 21 February Dincote presented to the press 17 Shining 
Path 
"terrorists" in Lima and Tingo Maria. Weapons, grenades, 
communications equipment, and subversive propaganda in their 
possession were seized. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 22 Feb 94 p 
A5) 
  Dincote personnel arrested four "terrorists," members of a 
Shining Path "special detachment" that operated in Lima's 
western zone. They had been involved in the burning of many 
buses and in truck robberies, among other activities. The 
leader of the group is Victor Eliseo Jorge Giuffra, aka Ricardo, 
who was trying to reorganize a "special detachment." (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 22 Feb 94 p A9)

  [Text] Lima, 9 Mar (EFE) -- A Peruvian Journalist 
Association (CPP) spokesman said on 9 March that some 30 
Peruvian journalists are prisoners in various Peruvian jails on 
charges of maintaining relations with terrorist groups. 
  A group of imprisoned reporters have decided to begin a 
protest hunger strike at the Campo Grande Lima prison, demanding 
that courts speed up the trials in which they are involved, a 
spokesman said. 
  The CPP official also denounced the case of journalist Juan 
Tuanama, a reporter for the weekly magazine JUNGLE of Tingo 
Maria, who remains in jail despite a judge's order to release 
him after being acquitted. Tuanama is accused of participating 
in various terrorist acts during the time he was in prison, the 
source said. 
  Other arrested journalists are charged with the crime of 
"advocating terrorism" because they worked at the newspapers EL 
DIARIO and CAMBIO, the newspapers of the Shining Path Maoist 
gang and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), 
respectively. 
  "They worked on those publications when the newspapers were 
legal leftist outlets and had nothing to do with the subversive 
groups who took over the newspapers afterward," the CPP 
spokesman said. 
  The official also reported that the Supreme Court annulled a 
lower court decision releasing journalists Alicia Figueroa and 
Gisela Gutarra and ordered that they be arrested again. 
  Imprisoned journalist Monica Palomo, who is five months 
pregnant, has been urgently sent to a Lima hospital due to a 
placenta detachment that is threatening to cause the abortion of 
her baby.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Israeli Chief of Staff Ehuda 
Barak received the plan for attacking the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
the first week of February. In light of that plan, he gave 
orders to change the security guards in the city of Hebron one 
week before the massacre. The change involved 20 security 
chiefs, who were informed of the details of the settlers' scheme 
to commit the massacre. 
  Our information is that the Israeli security chiefs ordered 
the Israeli soldiers to intervene should the plan fail or in 
case the Palestinians resisted the settlers who had been 
selected to carry out the plan. The name "Operation Theresa" 
was given to the operation to storm the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and 
slaughter worshipers inside it. "Theresa" is the name of a 
leading settler who took part in arranging the massacre together 
with the chief of staff and three Israeli leaders. Operation 
Theresa was the literal outcome of the seven agreements Rabin 
signed with settlers leaders, the agreements which AL-SHA'B 
publicized a few months back. 
  Information reveals that sophisticated Israeli weapons were 
handed to the settlers 48 hours before the massacre. The 
weapons were transported from the United States by the terrorist 
Zionist groups, who are still in possession of these weapons.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Mar (MENA)--Yemeni Interior Minister 
Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil denied accusations that 
his country is one of the countries exporting terrorism and 
terrorists to Egypt. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, he 
said that Yemen is targeted by terrorism and terrorists, 
especially the al-Jihad Organization and the Arab Afghans who 
have been discovered by the investigations to be behind a number 
of recent assassinations in Yemen. 
  He added that the brain and financier of terrorism in Yemen 
is Saudi businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin, who is wanted for trial 
in Yemen. 
  The Yemeni interior minister stressed his country's 
readiness 
to deport any Egyptian in Yemeni territory who is suspected by 
Egyptian authorities of being involved in terrorist incidents. 
He said that he will be the first to defend Egypt's security 
and stability. 
  Brig. Gen al-Mutawakkil revealed that Yemen prevented those 
who came from Afghanistan from using its territories as a 
crossing point, stressing that Yemen will never be a source of 
concern for Egypt. 
  Regarding the internal situation in Yemen, he said that he 
expects the military skirmishes in Abyan and Mudiyah to stop 
next week and the forces involved in the fighting to withdraw to 
their original positions.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional guerrilla activities and clashes with 
government military units monitored through 7 March; source 
follows in parentheses after each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Seven Caqueta and Cauca government officials kidnapped by 
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) guerrillas were 
released unharmed on 1 March after being held captive for nearly 
a week. Simultaneously, military forces arrested 10 alleged 
guerrillas in Bolivar. In another incident that has occurred in 
Bolivar, a UP (Patriotic Union) guerrilla was killed during a 
clash with a military patrol. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 2 Mar 94 p 8a) 
  At least seven guerrillas have been killed and four arrested 
by Army units in several clashes that have occurred in Sucre, 
Santander, Boyaca, Norte de Boyaca, Cauca and Casanare; in 
another incident, the ELN (Army of National Liberation) has 
kidnapped Argelia Mayor Carlos Ivan Agrada. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 1 Mar 94) 
  As the election draws nearer, extremist forces are 
continuing 
their attacks against candidates for public office. 
Unidentified individuals have killed Evaristo Amaya Morales, La 
Uribe mayoral candidate, while he was campaigning in Meta 
Department. In addition, a terrorist group detonated an 
explosive device while congressional candidate Telesforo Pedraza 
was campaigning in Huila Department. The government has 
announced it will not reschedule elections due to political 
violence. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 26 Feb 94 
pp. 1a, 6a) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Official sources have reported a Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) column has attacked a military base 
in the northern Department of Quiche. A UN delegation was 
visiting the base at the moment of the attack. The Army Press 
and Information Department (Dide) has said a UN Human Rights 
delegation was at the base at the time and was able to witness 
the attack. Dide has also said the attack, which occurred on 2 
March, is clear evidence of the URNG's lack of willingness to 
negotiate peace. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1701 GMT 5 Mar 94) 
  Members of the National Police Department deactivated two 
explosive devices on 27 February. Both bombs carried subversive 
propaganda and were found in Guatemala City, one behind the 
municipal building, the other hidden inside a bench at the 
central park. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 2 Mar 94

  [Text] Tehran, March, 8, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry 
Tuesday strongly denied a claim by Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak that Iran was involved in an attempt on the life of 
Egyptian Premier, 'Atif Sidqi. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Morteza Sarmadi told IRNA that 
such baseless and false allegations indicated not only the 
"Cairo regime's helplessness and confusion but also the critical 
situation in that country." 
  Sarmadi expressed "deep regret" that a person at the head of 
state level raised "such false claims based on fabrications" 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  In an interview published in the latest issue of Kuwaiti 
daily, AL-QABAS, Mubarak accused Iran of paying US$13,000 to an 
Egyptian terrorist to assassinate the Egyptain prime minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Saudi Businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin by 'Ali </F>
'Abd-al-Karim and al-Nur Ahmad al-Nur in Khartoum; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI] The attempted attack on 
you took place after the horrific incident in the Ansar 
al-Sunnah Mosque. What is your relationship with the Ansar 
al-Sunnah group? 
  Bin-Ladin: Our relationship with the Ansar 
al-Sunnah group is like our relationship with the other Islamic 
groups -- a close, cordial, and good relationship based on 
brotherhood in God. It is Muslims' duty toward their Muslim 
brothers. 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: Did you have any dealings with 
the Afghan groups? 
  Bin-Ladin: We harbor no hostility toward anyone 
or any Afghan groups. Our relationship with the Afghan 
mojahedin began in 1399 Hijra (1979), namely when we went to 
Lahore, Pakistan, and worked with the Islamic group in Pakistan 
to support the mojahedin against the communist invasion. 
  We have focused on helping the brothers in Afghanistan since 
1985. We opened camps to train young men to fight the Soviet 
invasion. We cooperated with everyone to help Muslims to defend 
themselves and their religion, especially as the enemies of 
Islam want Muslims to remain weak and subservient. 
  Our work in Afghanistan, which caused some people to insult 
us, was devoted to fighting the communist invasion and raising 
the banner that reads "There is no other god but God." 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: In your view, who is 
responsible for that attack? 
  Bin-Ladin: There are external quarters at which a 
finger of accusation could be pointed. They are the quarters 
spitefully hostile to Islam. They do not accept the natural 
right of Muslims to defend themselves. 
  Our position in Afghanistan caused some of Islam's enemies 
to 
try to obstruct our cooperation with Muslims. The world tends 
to prefer to overlook the oppression and persecution in Bosnia 
and occupied Palestine and then hasten to accuse Muslims of 
terrorism if they defend themselves. It wants to keep Muslims 
weak and incapable of defending themselves. 
  We also know that there are contacts among diplomats, all 
designed to curb our movement and stop our contacts with our 
brothers. But we say that cooperation in piety is continuing 
among Muslims. 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: What is the nature of your 
relationship with Saudi Arabia? 
  Bin-Ladin: There is a disagreement because of 
their rejection of our cooperation with the Islamic awakening, 
support of Muslim issues, and opposition to their restrictions 
on the call [al-da'wah] and the preachers. 
  I am accused of supporting fundamentalism, even though 
everyone knows that this stems from our eagerness to raise the 
banner that reads "There is no other god but God" and support 
the Afghan mojahedin camps to fight oppression and communist 
aggression. I believe that all Muslims adopted this position; 
or that is what we believe was the case. 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: And with Egypt? 
  Bin-Ladin: The Egyptian press says that Usamah 
Bin-Ladin supports fundamentalism. We know that there are 
domestic problems in Egypt because of the state's violence 
against Islamists. Obviously there are bound to be reactions to 
this government policy. 
  Like many other Muslim young men, some Islamists in Egypt 
gained military experience in the Afghan mojahedin camps. These 
conditions forced some to take such positions in their countries 
to defend their religion and themselves. 
  The Egyptians are trying to indicate that I have something 
to 
do with the reactions taking place in their country. And they 
accuse me of posing a threat to them. 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: And with Yemen? 
  Bin-Ladin: What I said about Egypt I say about 
Yemen, which I believe is one of the best Arab and Muslim 
countries in terms of adherence to traditions and the faith. 
Nevertheless, its citizens have been subjected to murder and 
religious persecution. So it is natural for reactions to take 
place, even if some of Yemen's sons do train in Afghan camps. 
  The accusation that we support terrorism is a hostile, 
imperialist method designed to suppress Muslims' determination 
and paralyze their movement toward one another and toward their 
religion and faith. [passage omitted] 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: What is the nature of your 
presence in Sudan? 
  Bin-Ladin: I visited Sudan for the first time in 
1983, where I acquainted myself with its agricultural 
capabilities and investment opportunities. Four years ago we 
came here to cooperate and work in the areas of road 
construction and agriculture. I inherited this type of work 
from my father, may God have mercy on him. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Muhammad 'Allam and Ibqal 'Abdallah report: "Aden Handed </F>
Over Group of 'Afghans' to Cairo"] 
  [Excerpts] Cairo, Aden -- [Passage omitted] In Aden 
authoritative political sources said yesterday that the security 
services belonging to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] had 
handed over "terrorist" elements among the "Afghan Egyptians" 
[Egyptians who fought alongside Afghan mojahedin against the 
Soviets] arrested at the end of last month in Mudiyah, Abyan 
Governorate, with other groups of Arabs returning from 
Afghanistan to Yemen. 
  The sources said that "these Egyptians were handed over to 
the authorities in their country after proving their affiliation 
to the terrorist Jihad organization." 
  The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, pointed out that 
Brigadier General Muhammad Haydarah Masdus, deputy prime 
minister and member of the YSP Political Bureau, "handed over 
the Egyptians to security authorities in Cairo last week at 
Egypt's request after Cairo had heard of their arrest in Yemen." 
[passage omitted] 
  Security sources said yesterday that the "authorities in 
southern governorates intend to complete the investigations into 
the Afghan Arabs and then hand them over to the authorities in 
their countries under the Arab security agreement stipulating 
that terrorists be handed over to the states concerned with 
their trial." 
  As is known, the Arab Afghans held by the security 
authorities in Aden include Iraqis, Algerians, Sudanese, in 
addition to the Egyptians who were handed over to Egyptian 
authorities last week. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, identified here by his nom </F>
de guerre Abu-al-'Abbas, secretary general of the Palestine 
Liberation Front, PLF, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid, in Baghdad; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Majid] You said 
consequent action. What is the nature of this action? Will you 
resort to another option other than the option of a political 
solution? 
  'Abbas: Struggle is an integral and indivisible 
whole. However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially 
when you see your people being slaughtered. You must then look 
for an appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed 
struggle. As an organization, we still believe that armed 
struggle is a major tool to attain our people's rights in 
Palestine. Developments are escalating, and they are all 
related to what has taken place. We have great hope that God 
will grant us success and help us wipe away the tears of the 
widows and console the children who have lost their fathers and 
brothers. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Majid: The way you deal with the national 
Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas. 
Do you have contacts with this movement? 
  'Abbas: As an organization, we have carried out 
armed struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a 
continuous manner that has left its imprint in the national, 
Arab, and international arenas. We have never been negligent in 
this field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain 
so. Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one 
way or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces 
that work within the national framework, regardless of their 
political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the 
closer we become to these Palestinian organizations. 
  We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have 
contacts 
with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts 
might be developed. This depends on how close our political 
stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland. 
  'Abd-al-Majid: But do not you see that there is a 
contradiction between armed struggle and political action within 
the PLO framework? 
  'Abbas: This is an integration, not a 
contradiction. We are represented in the PLO and the PLO 
Executive Committee. We have developed relations with factions 
and forces that are outside the PLO framework. We also have 
relations with factions that left the PLO or that have adopted a 
certain stand toward the PLO leadership such as the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine. Our concept of integration is 
based on our reading of the PLO's current situation. In our 
opinion, the PLO still constitutes the moral entity of the 
people. In other words, it is the state of the Palestinians. 
[passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Majid: Do you have any advice for the PLO 
leadership? 
  'Abbas: Everyday carries new evidence of the blind 
and erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of 
the harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the 
losses which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed 
its course, especially since there are no signs or indications 
regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge 
national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are 
pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In 
addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still 
continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The 
only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave, 
unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into, 
before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Islamic Hamas Movement </F>
spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah by correspondent Muhammad Tishkar in 
Beirut; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] In the name of God, the merciful and the 
compassionate. The Palestinian Islamic Hamas Movement has 
announced that it rejects the dispatch of UN forces to the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to protect the Palestinians. 
Hamas Movement spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said in a telephone 
interview that this plan is designed to circumvent the basic 
problem, which is the presence of the Zionist occupation and the 
Zionist settlers on Palestinian territory. He affirmed that the 
PLO's purpose in making this suggestion is to attempt to tone 
down the escalating opposition among the Palestinian people 
inside and outside Palestine to enable the organization to 
resume its negotiations with the Zionist occupation. Ghawshah 
noted that the dispatch of UN observers will not ensure 
protection for the Palestinian people. Even if the UN Security 
Council decides to send armed forces to protect the 
Palestinians, he said, these forces will not be able to provide 
such protection. Proof of this is that thousands of UN armed 
forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina could not prevent massacres there.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have said the Tunis- 
headquartered PLO leadership has issued stringent orders to its 
armed cadres in the occupied territories to collect their 
weapons and store them with reliable persons, and not to use 
them in any fashion whatsoever. 
  The instructions were issued after the PLO leadership 
received reports that some armed Fatah cadres were planning 
massive reprisals in retaliation against the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. 
  Sources close to the Hamas Movement have said the 
Palestinian 
leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any military 
operations at present, and that it will persist with the civil 
disobedience campaign, contending that military operations at 
present could undermine political gains. 
  The sources said Hamas halfheartedly responded to this 
request, but said it cannot restrain its cadres inside the 
occupied territories due to the monstrosity of the [Hebron] 
massacre.

  [Text] Dubayy, 6 Mar (MENA)--Press reports published here 
today said that the PLO leadership has asked the Fatah Movement 
leaders inside the occupied territories not to take any military 
action against Israeli targets at this time. 
  AL-BAYAN cited Palestinian sources as saying that this 
request came in the wake of reports that reached the Palestinian 
command that some of the armed Fatah members in the occupied 
territories are planning with elements from Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] to stage widespread acts of revenge in 
retaliation for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  On the other hand, the same paper cited Hamas sources in 
Amman, Jordan, as saying that the group has agreed not to take 
military action at present and limit itself to civil 
disobedience and popular rebellion. 
  The sources added that Hamas agreed to this on the 
conditions 
that it be for a limited period of time and that this agreement 
would come after the PLO command informed it that there is an 
imminent agreement with the United States to provide 
international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories.

<F P=106> [Letter to AKHIR KHABAR from "the Hamas Movement;" place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Text] Editor-in-chief of AKHIR KHABAR, 
  Peace be upon you. Your newspaper published a frontpage 
report on Saturday 5 March 1994 headlined "Abu-'Ammar [PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat] Orders Not To Retaliate" which says that 
sources close to the Hamas Movement told you that the 
Palestinian leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any 
military operations at present, and that Hamas has halfheartedly 
responded to this request. 
  We emphasize that this report is baseless and that all 
information contained in this report is a total fabrication. 
  No contacts have taken place between our movement and the 
Palestinian leadership on retaliation for the Hebron massacre. 
Our movement's policy is clear and open. it calls for strong 
and decisive retaliation against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and revenge for the martyrs' blood. 
  Our position has always rejected the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements, and this fully conflicts with the published report. 
  While we wish that you would check such information through 
contacting the known Hamas representatives in the future, we 
hope that you will publish this clarification in the same place 
in which that report was published. [no signature as published]

<F P=106> [Report by Eli Bohadna] </F>
  [Text] "Special squads roam the area, and each squad acts 
independently," 21-year-old Ahmad 'Abdallah (an alias), 
commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Jewish squad, disclosed 
this week. "Since we look Jewish, our squad has one single 
objective -- to kidnap soldiers and civilians, and we have been 
training for that." 
  The interview with squad members was held after numerous 
coordination attempts and under prearranged conditions. The 
place: a safe house in Gaza. The squad members: Muhammad 
Hasan, 22; 'Ali Salim, 24; and Ahmad 'Abdallah, 21. All the 
names are aliases. Ahmad 'Abdallah is the spokesman, and the 
other two squad members listen attentively without saying a 
word. Ahmad looks Israeli in every way. The three squad 
members are not fugitives, and are therefore free to operate 
inside Israel. 
  Ahmad 'Abdallah is a product of the intifadah. Like many of 
his fellow Palestinians, he joined Fatah in the course of the 
intifadah. He says: "Even then, as a boy, I was very conscious 
of the need to liberate Palestine from occupation at any price." 
Like most of his friends, he was arrested in 1992, tried, and 
incarcerated for six months in Qezi'ot under administrative 
orders. 
  The reversal in his life occurred in prison. One day his 
Fatah commander, who was also in prison, asked him to tell his 
Israeli interrogators that it was he who had recruited 'Abdallah 
to Fatah. 'Abdallah, an intelligent young man, understood right 
away what lay behind the odd request. During the intifadah, 
"recruiters" received funds from PLO headquarters for every new 
recruit to the organization. The money was intended for 
operational uses only, but 'Abdallah's commander sought to 
increase his list of recruited activists in a bid to make 
personal gains. 
  "Did I throw stones and Molotov cocktails for money?" 
'Abdallah asked him. "You are a traitor and you are greedy. I 
was a fool to trust you and to believe you were a good man. I 
made a mistake." There was a confidence crisis between them, and 
Ahmad 'Abdallah quit Fatah and approached the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] commanders in prison with a request to join 
their organization. "They told me: 'Finish your prison term, 
and then we will decide.'" 
  In December 1992, 'Abdallah was released from prison. "About 
a month later, three people approached me. They told me they 
were from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, that they had been following me 
during that month, and that they liked me. They said I met 
their demands and asked me to become religious and to undergo 
some arduous training. At first, I was given simple tasks. At 
their request, I painted slogans on walls, but my aim was to be 
admitted into the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's operational 
activities. I did all they asked me. I wanted to realize my 
dream of becoming a fallen soldier." 
  "In April 1993, they decided to recruit me into the 
organization's military system. Three people came to me and got 
me into a car. I was very glad. Afterward we would go out to 
practice in orchards. The training was hard. We did physical 
fitness training, learned how to use weapons, and they taught me 
hand-to-hand combat. I was happy. I felt I was doing something 
for my people. I wanted to excel. I would drive near Army 
outposts, following Israeli Army vehicle movements. We would 
see a soldier waiting for a lift and plan how to kidnap him." 
  Question: Why did you want to join the Hamas? 
  'Abdallah: The Hamas Islamic movement and the 
'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squad are the right party. I heard about 
their activities, and I strove to be admitted into their ranks. 
Their work has quality. They are people of principle. In 
1989, three organization members -- Muhammad Nasir, Mahmud 
Mamduh, and their commander Muhammad Shurayha -- kidnapped 
soldier Ilan Sa'adon. After that operation, the Israeli Army 
managed to capture the squad commander, Muhammad Shurayha. The 
other two squad members managed to flee Israel. The kidnapping 
of Ilan Sa'adon and Avi Sasportas totally confused the Shin Bet. 
They were unable to discover the whereabouts of Ilan Sa'adon's 
body. They were likewise unable to dig up any details from the 
squad commander, although four years had elapsed since the 
soldier's kidnapping. 
  Question: Do you know where Ilan Sa'adon's 
remains are? 
  'Abdallah: There are rumors among 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam members that the two squad members who managed to 
escape, took the body with them, and it is in either Lebanon or 
Syria. 
  Question: What do you mean, rumors? 
  'Abdallah: That is what people in 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam are saying. 
  Question: Does it sound plausible to you that 
they should tote Sa'adon's body along outside Israel? 
  'Abdallah: I told you, that is what organization 
members have been saying. I can say nothing beyond that. 
  Question: How are contacts between the squads and 
the commander established? 
  'Abdallah: There are three to four members in 
every squad. There are dozens of such squads. Contacts between 
them are established by squad commanders only. Squad members do 
not know about the existence of other squads or about the people 
who control any particular squad. Thus, if any one of the squad 
members is arrested, he will be unable to disclose any names 
except those of his fellow squad members. 
  Question: And how is the contact with the 
commander of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad, 'Abd-al-Fattah 
Sattari, established? 
  (Reporter's note: 'Abd-al-Fattah Sattari, alias the 
Engineer, was unofficially appointed commander of the 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad after organization commander 'Imad 
'Aqil was liquidated by the security forces in the course on an 
operation in the al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood on 25 December 1993.) 
  'Abdallah: Fattah al-Sattari is not the 
commander. He is an important figure in the organization, but 
we have another commander. 
  Question: Who? 
  'Abdallah, evasively: I don't think I know that. 
  Question: What is the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
squad's ultimate goal? 
  'Abdallah: The squad members have a deep sense of 
the need to liberate the occupied lands of Palestine. The enemy 
security forces tried every way to prevent us from carrying out 
attacks and to stop our activities. But they failed. We aim to 
liberate the land of Palestine from the Israeli occupation, to 
cleanse the holy land from Jewish filth. We are doing it for 
the sake of the Palestinian people and so that we may all go to 
heaven in the next world. 
  After Nasir Namrutti, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad 
commander, was killed while being pursued by enemy soldiers near 
Rafah, a unit named after him was established. Members of the 
squad decided to avenge his death by carrying out a shakedown 
attack: kidnapping a soldier, hiding him, and demanding the 
release of Palestinian prisoners, most notably the release of 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. 
  Members of the squad dressed up to look Jewish. They had 
all the resources for that. They spoke Hebrew as well as any 
Israeli, and they found a Peugeot 305 with yellow license 
plates. The squad had an excellent driver. He was bearded, and 
with a yarmulke on his head, he looked like a typical settler. 
No one would suspect him of being Muslim. Another squad member 
had fair hair. He was tall. A third member had a moustache and 
short hair. They set out early in the morning of 18 September 
1992. They drove around, looking for a Jewish soldier. 
  They reached the Morag settlement, but could not find a 
single soldier. Neither did they find a victim in the moshavim 
of Gan Or, Neve Deqalim, or Ganey Tal. In Moshav Netzer Hazani, 
they saw two soldiers at the gate, but they did not stop. They 
were looking for another victim. Near one of the moshavim, 
their car almost crashed into a local car. One of one fighters 
put his head out of the window and started cursing the Arab 
driver in Hebrew, because soldiers and settlers were standing at 
the gate of the moshav, and he wanted them to think our fighters 
were Jewish. Then they proceeded toward Gaza. 
  Near al-Nusayrat they saw soldier Alon Qarawani standing all 
alone. They stopped, and Qarawani asked whether they were going 
to Ashqelon. They said they were only driving as far as the 
Erez checkpoint. The soldier agreed and got in the car. As 
they were driving, one of our fighters took out a gun and asked 
the soldier: "Do you know us?" He said he did not. The squad 
members told him they belonged to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the 
sons of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. 
  The soldier started crying. They tried to calm him, they 
said he should not worry. "We only want your weapon," they told 
him. The soldier told them: "Take it, I don't need it. I have 
parents and a family, don't kill me." The fighters told him: 
"We too have mothers and fathers and friends, and you are 
killing them." The soldier answered he was not on combat duty, 
that he only repaired Army cars. 
  Further down the road, our fighters drove into an orchard 
and 
ordered him to take off his clothes and keep on only his shorts. 
Then they stabbed him with knives. They thought he was dead, 
and they tied him to a tree. They took his identity card and 
all his equipment and left the place. Palestinians who saw the 
soldier summoned the troops, and later we learned that he had 
not died, but was only badly wounded. 
  Question: Did you participate in that operation? 
  'Abdallah: No. 
  Question: Then how come you know so many details 
of the event? 
  'Abdallah: I did not participate in that 
operation. 
  Question: How do you enter Israel? 
  'Abdallah: We dress up like Jews. No one stops 
us. We enter with a car with yellow license plates and drive 
through roadblocks without being stopped. Sometimes we even 
enter as Arabs. We are not fugitives. 
  Question: What do you think of the Fatah Hawks 
organization? 
  'Abdallah: Fatah is divided into two parts -- 
those who support the peace process and those who oppose it. We 
respect them and we hope they will continue their military 
operations against the Zionist enemy. At this stage, we all 
have to take up arms and act together to release our lands. The 
Palestinian people does not have to obey 'Arafat's orders. The 
only way for us is to win the war, and God will decide who will 
live in this land. 
  Question: Are you associated with the Fatah Hawks 
in any way? 
  'Abdallah: There is cooperation between us, but 
only with activists who oppose the peace process and would like 
to take up arms against Israelis. We help and encourage them. 
But the link is not strong. We show them respect. 
  Question: Will you try to assassinate 'Arafat if 
there is peace? 
  'Abdallah: I do not think 'Arafat will ever get 
to come here. There will be no peace and no autonomy. And if 
there is autonomy, God forbid, I think the Palestinian people 
will judge 'Arafat by his deeds and start a revolution. If we 
kill 'Arafat, we will lose our people's love. 
  Question: How many activists are there in the 
'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam squads? 
  'Abdallah: The number is unknown. Some of our 
members are also active in Fatah. Everybody knows they to 
belong to Fatah, but in fact they operate under cover, and they 
belong to 'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam. Also, there are some who do 
not pray and look secular, to prevent people from knowing what 
organization they belong to.

  [Text] Let us begin [Secretary General of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine] Nayif Hawatimah's story 
where that of the secretary general of another front ends. 
  During his visit [to Jordan] where he met with the prime 
minister, Nayif Hawatimah expressed displeasure with the 
meticulous search of his car. 
  Prime Minister al-Majali explained to Nayif Hawatimah that 
he 
was not personally targeted by this search but that the 
Jordanian security authorities at the border posts have started 
to carefully search all incoming vehicles to Jordan, whether 
private or official. 
  Al-Majali explained to Hawatimah that Jordan was forced to 
do 
this out of its fear that these vehicles might be used to 
transport weapons into Jordan as had taken place with the car of 
George Habash [the secretary general of the Popular Front the 
Liberation of Palestine, PFLP]. 
  The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent visit 
to Jordan, his car was searched and various types of weapons and 
silencers were found in it. 
  On the other hand, the security forces have stepped up their 
surveillance of all the Jordanian border posts to foil any arms 
smuggling operation, particularly after the two cinema 
explosions.

  [Text] 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PLO Executive Committee 
member and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] 
Political Bureau member, has denied the rumor that tried to link 
the movie theater bombings to the search of PFLP Secretary 
General George Habash's car, in which, the rumor alleges, 
weapons and silences were found. 
  In a statement to SHIHAN, Malluh said such rumors seek to 
harm Palestinian-Jordanian relations and to revive the past. 
Malluh said that tendentious parties are trying to link the 
bombings to the Palestinian factions in general to cast doubts 
on Palestinian-Jordanian relations, which are now being 
established on strong foundations. 
  He said Dr. Habash came to Jordan on 23 February on a 
private 
visit and was not searched. He was treated with all the respect 
befitting a pan-Arab struggler, Malluh added.

<F P=106> [All Algerian names as received] </F>
  [Text] Algiers, March 7 (AFP)--A Muslim fundamentalist 
group, the Armed Islamic Jihad Front (FIDA), on Monday said its 
members killed the director of the fine arts college, Ahmed 
Asselah, and his son, Rabah. 
  The FIDA claimed responsibility for Saturday's killings in a 
statement faxed to AFP. 
  Asselah, 55, was shot several times in the face by two or 
three men early Saturday shortly after he left his car and was 
walking to his office in the school building, a university 
spokesman said. 
  His son Rabah, a student at the university, was shot in the 
abdomen and died later. 
  The assailants fled. 
  Asselah was prominent in the so-called "democratic" movement 
which opposes Islamic fundamentalism. He was the brother of 
Algerian independence hero Hocine Asselah, for whom one of 
Algiers' main avenues is named. 
  "The Armed Islamic Jihad Front F.I.D.A claims the attack 
perpetrated against Ahmed Asselah and his son," the statement in 
Arabic and French said, before quoting a Koranic verse to the 
effect that "offenders will know what fate awaits them." 
  The group first emerged when it claimed responsibility in an 
anonymous telephone call to AFP for the February 21 murder of 
French librarian Vincent Grau in an attack here. 
  Muslim extremists started a war against the authorities and 
began targetting intellectuals after the January 1992 
cancellation of the second round of a general election the 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Egyptian Islamic fundamentalist </F>
Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim by Charlotte Aagaard; date, place not given' 
see 12 January and 1 March Terrorism Reports for other Qasim 
interviews] 
  [Text] In the past week a hitherto unknown man, Tal'at 
Fu'ad Qasim, has come under the media spotlight because, as a 
supporter of the militant Islamic group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, 
he has been accused of turning Denmark into a base for "terror" 
against the Egyptian government and of having encouraged 
violence against foreigners in Egypt. 
  All of this has happened since Qasim obtained political 
asylum in Denmark. 
  In an exclusive interview with INFORMATION, however, he 
rejects the accusations, and asserts his right -- on an equal 
footing with thousands of other refugees in Denmark -- to 
maintain his involvement in political developments in his own 
country. 
<H5>  A Committed Man </H5>
  And committed he is. You sense it at once as he walks into 
the living room on the fifth floor of an apartment block in 
Valby. 
  Committed, reserved, shy, and worried. These are the words 
that come to mind as he sits down on the couch, keeping on his 
light brown, Afghan camel-hair hat, supplementing the Islamist's 
traditional uniform: long white robe, baggy trousers, long 
black beard and short hair. 
  It is Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, so it is only 
INFORMATION's reporter, the photographer and the six-year old 
son of the house who are offered juice, biscuits, and fresh 
dates in welcome. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim recounts the beginnings of his political 
activity in al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah during his student days at 
the university of Assuit, situated on the banks of the Nile in 
central Egypt. At that time al-Jama'ah was a student movement, 
but today the group, which is thought to number 10,000 militant 
activists and a far larger group of sympathizers, is engaged in 
an armed struggle against the Egyptian Government. In Asut, 
Qasim was studying engineering, but was imprisoned for his part 
in student riots just after he had completed his exams. 
  He spent eight years in an Egyptian jail until December 
1989, 
when he succeeded in escaping, first to Peshawar in Pakistan, 
the Islamic Mujahidin's headquarters. Here he was the chief 
editor of the paper AL-MURABITUN, and head of the Arab press 
federation. There was no question of active resistance to the 
Communist enemy in Kabul, however. 
  In May 1992 he came to Denmark as a result of an invitation 
to hold a series of lectures, sought political asylum, and was 
granted it, partly on account of a death sentence passed on him 
in absentia by an Egyptian military court in January, 1993. 
  His view is that the accusations -- which range from the 
attempted overthrow of the government, complicity in the murder 
of politicians, to unlawful possession of weapons -- are the 
fabrications of the Egyptian Government. Amnesty International 
pronounced the trial unfair due to the absence of a defence and 
lack of the right to appeal. 
  Today, Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim describes his role in al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah as that of a source of ideological inspiration. 
  "I have not had any physical contact with al-Jama'ah in 
Egypt 
since I left the country. The link is on a spiritual level. 
Perhaps people read my publications or hear my speeches." Qasim 
stresses, however, that his knowledge of the organization makes 
him fully capable of speaking on its behalf. 
<H5>  Political Commitment </H5>
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim flatly denies the claim that he is a part 
of an international network of al-Jama'ah people who, from their 
position in exile, lead the struggle and organize violent action 
against Mubarak's government: 
  "It is an outright lie. It is an attempt on the part of the 
Egyptian Government to justify its actions towards al-Jama'ah 
activists and to take attention away from the government's 
failed economic and social policy." 
  However, he is not prepared to give up the right to 
political 
involvement. 
  "I came to Denmark to live in peace. I have no intention of 
creating problems here, but I cannot ignore what is happening in 
Egypt. I do the same as tens of thousands of Lebanese, 
Palestinian, or Iranian refugees. I do, after all, have the 
right to hold an opinion on what is happening in my home country 
-- and the right to express it." 
  Qasim told us he was disappointed that his right to asylum 
in 
Denmark has been publicly questioned. 
  "If I am unwelcome in Denmark, then I am ready to take the 
first plane back to Egypt and face my death sentence. But if I 
am handed over, no Dane will be able to look in the mirror 
without seeing hypocrisy staring him in the face." 
  For the moment, extradition to Egypt is impossible according 
to INFORMATION's sources, simply because Denmark is a 
co-signatory of a number of conventions which prohibit the 
handing over of people condemned to death. 
<H5>  Violence Against Foreigners </H5>
  Another claim which has been put forward by the media is 
that 
in the Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI [see 1 March 1994 Terrorism 
Report], Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim allegedly incited violence against 
foreigners, including Danes, who travel to Egypt as tourists, 
work, or invest there. 
  This includes, among others, F.L. Smith, A.P. Moller, and 
Aarhus Flydedok. Denmark also finances a number of aid projects 
in Egypt. 
  "I have never given an interview to the newspaper in 
question. It is a fabrication. al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah printed 
a communique warning foreigners against going to Egypt out of 
concern for their safety, because they are in confrontation with 
the government. It is every Muslim's duty to ensure the safety 
of visitors, and that safety cannot be guaranteed at the moment. 
Therefore it would be unwise to travel to Egypt." 
  "Would a tourist be likely to go on holiday to Sarajevo, 
Mogadishu, or Baghdad? It is the same in Egypt today. Egypt is 
involved in a violent confrontation and it would not be safe for 
tourists to go there." 
  He also finds it "difficult to imagine good Muslims being 
involved in attacks on innocent tourists." Instead, he accuses 
forces within the Egyptian Government of being behind the 
attacks on tourists which until now have cost seven foreigners 
their lives and wounded dozens of others. The purpose of this, 
according to Qasim, is to justify the brutality used against the 
Islamic opposition and to discredit it. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim thinks that there is one good explanation 
for the furor caused by a series of articles on him. 
  "Since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of 
communism, 
Islamophobia, the fear of Islam, has spread like wildfire. I 
cannot understand why people here in the West are so keen to 
create a boogieman. It only serves as a provocation." Qasim 
wants to see more objectivity in the descriptions of what is 
happening in the Islamic world. 
  Asked whether he is unable to understand Danes' fear of 
Islam, when they have the deaths of foreign tourists in Algeria 
and Egypt as well as the bloody Iranian revolution at the back 
of their minds, he answered: 
  "Yes, I can well understand that. But then the Danes must 
also appreciate how ordinary Egyptians feel. The Egyptians can 
be compared to a dove in a cage. Normally doves are very 
peaceful animals, but if they are put into a cage it is only 
natural that they peck your finger. When the Muslims in Egypt 
shake off the dictatorship and introduce an Islamic system, 
people will see that there is nothing to be afraid of." 
  When the Islamic forces take over power in Egypt, which, 
according to Qasim will happen "before most people expect it," 
foreigners will again be welcome and assured of their safety in 
Egypt, he promised.

Fawzi Mahran in Asyut and Muhammad al-Sayyid Abu-Zayd in Suhaj, 
the security forces found papers and lists bearing the names, 
whereabouts, and movements of a number of extremist organization 
members, including al-Jihad and the Islamic Group, since the 
beginning of last year. 
  The security agencies have also found the cipher 
organization

  [Text] Some private security firms have helped to smuggle 
certain terrorist leaders into the country. These included 
Jamal-al-Din Farghali, commander of the Islamic Group's military 
wing in Upper Egypt; Muhammad al-'Abbasi; Husayn Mahmud; and 10 
other group leaders. 
  AL-AHALI has obtained information proving that among the 
12,000 employees of these private security firms, 400 are police 
officers who receive monthly salaries ranging from 3,000 to 
7,000 pounds and 1,500 are Islamic groups' members who were 
formerly in Afghanistan. The Egyptian Afghans were employed on 
the recommendation of Gulf princes who are major shareholders in 
these security firms. According to our information, 87 of these 
Egyptian Afghans have participated in terrorist operations since 
1989. 
  The reports also say that many Arab figures suspected of 
links to Egypt's terrorist groups own shares in these firms 
valued at more than $5 million. The list of shareholders 
includes 'Abd-al-Rahman Ladin's three sons. These are Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, who founded a "base" as a way station for al-Jihad 
leaders who formerly traveled to Afghanistan from Saudi Arabia, 
and his brothers Badr and Tariq. Usamah Bin-Ladin visited Egypt 
prior to the execution of several major terrorist operations. 
  The three brothers' shares in one private security firm are 
worth $1.2 million. 
  Other shareholders include Zayd al-Mutawakkil from Yemen who 
owns shares worth $250,000. Reports link him to training camps 
for Arab Afghans in Yemen's Sa'dah District. 
  Two United Arab Emirates nationals, Fahd al-Qasim who owns 
shares worth $350,000 and Sultan Bin-al-Muhyi who has $300,000 
worth of shares, have connections with government circles in 
Tehran. 
  The list of shareholders goes on: Hasan Fanjanri ($500,000), 
Muhammad Ahmad Hasan ($400,000), Al-Mahdi Bin-Ibrahim Sultan 
($350,000), Nimr-al-Ward Zaki ($300,000), al-'Aris 
Bin-al-Majdawi ($250,000), Fathi al-Fadl ($250,000), Zakariya 
al-'Urabi ($200,000), Ahmad Bin-'Abd-al-Muta'ali al-Husayni 
($200,000), 'Abd-al-Rahim al- Mu'izz ($150,000), Bandar 
al-Shihabi ($150,000), and Shaykh 'Abd-al- 'Aziz al-Fadl 
(250,000 Egyptian pounds). 
  These security firms prepared 2,400 dossiers containing 
important data about Egyptian public figures, including the 
official's position, address, telephone numbers at home and 
work, and the names and abilities of his bodyguards. Also 
included were the routes followed by the motorcades of senior 
officials and the places they frequently visited, in addition to 
data on their wives and children. 
  Some private security firms were thus a major link in the 
chain and supplied information and detailed maps of the 
movements of senior officials who were the target of terrorist 
operations in recent years. 
  According to information obtained by a major government 
department, the terrorist groups sought to penetrate the 
country's security agencies by offering private security jobs to 
senior security officials. They aimed to establish a "parallel" 
Interior Ministry but with objectives different from those of 
the real ministry. 
  Based on this information, Major General Hasan al-Alfi 
decided soon after he became interior minister and prior to the 
unsuccessful attempt on his life, to rescind the private 
security firms' licenses. He asked security officials employed 
by them to leave those private jobs.

  [Text] The Islamic Group has announced that it detonated 
two bombs in front of the Nile Tower in al-Jizah, which houses 
the Egyptian-American Business Council, the International Bank 
of Commerce, and the Transmed Travel Agency. The group said the 
detonations were in retaliation for the criminal act committed 
in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  A statement by the Islamic Group said the two operations 
were 
the beginning of what it termed revenge for the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque martyrs and noted that revenge will continue in the end 
of the month of Ramadan [sentence as published].

  [Text] Under the supervision of the public prosecutor, 
Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf-al-Din, the Higher State Security 
Prosecution is conducting extensive investigations into the 
seizure of explosives bound for terrorists in Asyut. The 
explosives consisted of approximately 100 kg of gunpowder used 
in making bombs and explosive devises. The prosecution is also 
conducting investigations to identify the source of these 
explosives. 
  In releasing this information, Counselor Sharaf-al-Din said 
the haul was found in the possession of two truck drivers. The 
two suspects admitted that a man, whose first name and 
description were disclosed, gave them two sacks of explosives, 
each containing about 50 kg of gunpowder, claiming that they 
contained organic fertilizer. The suspects said that he asked 
them to deliver the sacks to another man in Asyut after giving 
his description and fixing a rendezvous point and gave them a 
large sum of money. 
  The Higher State Security Prosecution ordered the arrest of 
the man described by the drivers and efforts are now under way 
to detain him. The two gunpowder sacks were delivered to the 
criminology laboratory for a technical report.

  [Text] In statements to AL-MUSAWWAR, Director of Damietta 
Security Major General Taj-al-Din Abu-al-Nasr said the arrest of 
the Damietta City Council chairman and four other Council 
members revealed an attempt to revive the Muslim Brotherhood 
Movement in the governorate. 
  Dr. 'Ali Day, chairman of the City Council and an 
ophthalmologist, has been arrested after investigations revealed 
that he had recruited young men from Ramadan sports courses in 
order to give them training in acts of violence at unpopulated 
areas in Ra's al-Barr and (al-Dibah) this winter. [see previous 
Terrorism Report] 
  A security source told AL-MUSAWWAR that the chairman of the 
City Council, an ophthalmologist who had returned from Peshawar 
and who was refused a job in the health department in Damietta, 
took advantage of disputes among the National Democratic Party 
members in recent elections and got elected. He was chosen from 
among the Labor Party members to be chairman of the Damietta 
City Council. 
  The source said that by observing these courses, it was 
evident that the ages of the young men who underwent these 
courses ranged from 16 to 20. He added: By following up on 
this matter last week we found 12 minibuses carrying over 140 
young men roaming Ra's al- Barr at 0730 in search of a place for 
an obstacle course. 
  The source assured that the youths were not practicing 
soccer 
but conducting training on karate, violent games, and target 
practice.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, March 8 (AFP) -- A militant Islamic 
group, al- Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [IG], late Monday claimed 
responsibility for renewed train attacks in southern Egypt and 
warned they would continue until the end of the week to avenge 
the Hebron massacre. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, which seeks to replace the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak with an Islamic state, 
urged the population to avoid "tourist sites, public 
transportation and everything connected with banks, which 
practice usury." 
  A communique delivered to international press agencies here 
said the group had carried out three attacks in southern Egypt 
early Monday that according to the latest interior ministry toll 
wounded 12 Egyptians. 
  It said the operation, the third it has claimed against 
trains travelling in southern Egypt in the past two weeks, had 
targeted "tourist trains" and had been conducted "to avenge the 
martyrs" of Hebron. 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said the train attacks would 
"continue until the end of the month of Ramadan," the holy month 
of dawn-to- dusk fasting scheduled to end this weekend. 
  While the movement has directed previous operations against 
tourist facilities as part of its campaign to cripple the 
government, two of the trains attacked with automatic weapons 
early Monday carried only second and third class carriages and 
were being used by Egyptians of modest means. 
  Eleven people, six of them tourists, were hurt in a bomb 
attack on February 23 on a train between Cairo and Luxor. Four 
days earlier, two tourists and two Egyptians were wounded when 
gunmen fired on a train south of Asyut. Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
claimed responsibility for both operations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Mar (MENA)--The State Security 
Investigation Service [SSIS] has arrested 25 terrorists 
responsible for the recent wave of bomb attacks on banks in 
Cairo and al-Jizah. Revealing the information, an Interior 
Ministry source said that SSIS officers obtained search warrants 
from the Public Prosecution Office and stormed terrorist 
hideouts in Cairo, al-Jizah, Suez, al-Qalyubiyah, and 
al-Sharqiyah. 
  The source said that among those arrested is a man who was 
in 
charge of liaison between the group's [not further specified] 
members at home and abroad. 
  The source added that at the time of his arrest this 
terrorist was in possession of an explosive charge matching 
those used in the recent bombings, dynamite sticks, and foreign 
currency. 
  Among those arrested are 'Irfan Muhammad Hasan al-Khuli, 
sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor in connection 
with the 19/93 military case involving a shooting in Zinhum area 
in Cairo; Yasir Fathi Muhammad Ahmad Fawwaz, who is wanted by 
the police for involvement in terrorist attacks including one 
against a tourist bus in Asyut; Muhammad Fawzi Muhammad Ibrahim 
al-Sayyid, a leading member of the organization [not further 
specified] in Suez, who is wanted by the police for involvement 
in acts of violence in Suez; and Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah Sayyid 
'Uthman, a member of the organization [not further specified] in 
east Cairo. 
  The Higher State Security Prosecution Office is 
interrogating 
the defendants. According to the source, the suspects have 
admitted involvement in the recent wave of bomb attacks against 
several banks in Cairo and al-Jizah. They also admitted 
plotting to assassinate public figures and policemen. 
  The source said suspects' confessions confirmed information 
available to the SSIS that some fugitive terrorist leaders--some 
still in Afghanistan and others who have returned from 
there--are involved in planning, giving assignments, and 
financing the said terrorist moves. These fugitive leaders are: 
  --Tal'at Yasin Muhammad Hammam [aka Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim], a 
fugitive sentenced to death in the case of the Returnees From 
Afghanistan Organization. 
  --Islam Ahmad Muhammad al-Gharmi, a fugitive leader trained 
in Afghanistan to carry out bombings. 
  Husam Muhammad Khamis Nuwayr, a fugitive terrorist leader 
wanted in the case of Dr. Rif'at al-Mahjub's assassination. 
  One of the detainees, the security source added, is a 
fugitive leader sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor in 
Military Crimes Case 19/93, concerning the shooting in Zinhum 
region. 
  Another detainee is a fugitive in Yemen tasked to receive 
sophisticated training in Afghanistan on remotely-controlled 
bombings. He was sent to Egypt about four months ago to take 
part in planned suicidal operations targeting the motorcade of 
an important figure. 
  The Interior Ministry praised the public's positive 
involvement in confronting and foiling the criminal schemes of 
the terrorists and extremists.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Mar (MENA)--The Higher State Security 
Prosecution Office, led by Public Prosecutor 'Abd-al-Sami' 
Sharaf- al-Din, is currently questioning the 25 defendants in 
the case of the terrorist organization involved in banks 
bombings. They have been in custody for 15 days pending the 
interrogations. 
  The defendants in this case face several charges, including 
membership in a group established in violation of the law and 
the Constitution that seeks to change the regime by force; 
criminal agreement to carry out several bombing operations to 
disturb security and damage the national economy; and possession 
of explosives, bombs, and weapons without a license. 
  The defendants gave a detailed confession about the role of 
each one of them in the recent bombings in front of a number of 
banks in Cairo and al-Jizah. They also admitted that they 
planned to assassinate some figures and police officers and blow 
up a number of other banks. 
  The Prosecution Office has decided to seize the money found 
with the defendants and to bring experts from the criminal 
laboratory to examine the explosives and ammunition impounded. 
Officials from the Prosecution Office examined six places where 
the defendants used to hide and keep their weapons and 
explosives. Eyewitnesses will later testify before the 
prosecutors about the crimes of the defendants. Meanwhile, the 
questioning of the defendants by prosecutors will continue.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Mar (MENA)-- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has revealed a serious, sizable terrorist scheme that 
was ready for implementation during 'Id al-Adha [holiday]. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, 
Friday, the interior minister disclosed that the security 
agencies managed to frustrate the scheme beforehand, after 
seizing faxed instructions from abroad found in the possession 
of the 25 terrorists arrested last Sunday. 
  Al-Alfi added that the dreadful scheme sought to terrify the 
public by carrying out a number of terrorist operations such as 
blowing up a considerable number of recreation grounds, cinemas, 
and theaters and assassinating a number of public figures. 
  In the interview, al-Alfi reveals that large amounts of 
money, estimated at thousands of dollars, were found in the 
possession of the members of this new terrorist organization, 
which belongs to the "Islamic Group," who were involved in 
recent attempts to blow up banks. The money was being used to 
finance their operations. 
  Al-Alfi added that large amounts of material used in making 
high- explosive charges were discovered in hideouts in Asyut and 
Cairo. Sent from abroad, the material contained new substances 
that were to be used for the first time and were to be set off 
by remote control to cause the largest possible explosions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Hasan </F>
al-Alfi by 'Amr 'Abd-al-Sami' in Cairo "the day before 
yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Reports of the arrest of 25 
terrorists involved in recent bombings in Cairo have aroused 
general satisfaction in Egypt. Meanwhile the terrorists were 
shocked by the reports, which caused them to issue a statement 
on Tuesday announcing a halt to their operations for a week. 
However, the escape of three terrorists, among them Tal'at 
Yasin Hammam (Islamic Group), arouses questions about whether 
these fugitive are capable of carrying out new operations. What 
is your opinion? 
  Al-Alfi: Anything is possible in the situation we 
are going to talk about. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Sami': It is said that terrorism poses a 
threat to all Arab and Islamic states. To what extent are 
Pakistani authorities cooperating in this connection, and are 
there any positive signs in this cooperation under the new 
government there? 
  Al-Alfi: Contacts with Pakistan are still 
continuing. 
  'Abd-al-Sami': Has there been any positive 
development under the new government headed by Benazir Bhutto, 
which has no fundamentalist link, in contrast to the former 
government of Nawaz Sharif? 
  Al-Alfi: To some extent. 
  'Abd-al-Sami': What do you mean by "to some 
extent?" 
  Al-Alfi: I mean there is a positive development. 
  'Abd-al-Sami': Has that development produced 
tangible results? 
  Al-Alfi: Yes, it has produced tangible results, 
but these matters cannot be discussed in the press. [passage 
omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Sami': How do you view Libyan allegations 
that U.S. and Israeli intelligence services kidnapped al-Kikhya 
to give these states the right to escalate their campaign 
against Libya and hit it? 
  Al-Alfi: So far none of what has been said has 
proved to be true. On that issue, I would like to say that 
al-Kikhya came to Egypt with an Algerian passport to attend a 
conference. He did not inform us of that. Besides, he is not a 
political refugee in Egypt. Any political refugee in Egypt is 
provided with protection, surveillance, and security. [passage 
omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Sami': How do you view the effect of the 
future situation in Gaza on security in Egypt, especially as 
regards the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating via the 
Rafah crossing point if the Palestinian-Israeli disagreement 
over who should control this crossing point leads to a formula 
resulting in loopholes in control measures? 
  Al-Alfi: There are security preparations 
everywhere, especially the outlets and borders in Egypt: east, 
west, north, and south; on land, at sea, and in the air. I have 
set up a special department called the outlets department headed 
by an assistant minister in order to supply the outlets with the 
latest equipment to detect falsification and forgery, uncover 
wanted people and smuggled and banned items, and arrest those 
who infiltrate the borders. This is to be coordinated with the 
border guard in the Armed Forces. 
  We have no fears over the possibility of some terrorists' 
infiltrating, for two reasons: First, we are in control of our 
side of the Rafah crossing point. This side will obviously not 
be subjected to any change, regardless of the formula reached 
between the Palestinians and the Israelis vis-a-vis control over 
the other side in the negotiations concerning the implementation 
of the declaration of principles agreement. 
  Second, both the PLO and Israel are eager to control 
security 
in Gaza, and it cannot be said that one of them is more 
interested in the matter than the other. 
  There is complete agreement that the peace agreement's 
success requires complete vigilance, because any terrorist 
schemes through the Rafah crossing point would have a bigger 
negative impact on the future of peace between the Palestinians 
and Israel than on the situation in Egypt. 
  'Abd-al-Sami': I am asking that question in 
particular because there are fears that a relationship might be 
established between extremist elements from Hamas, for example, 
and terrorists in Egypt. 
  Al-Alfi: We are taking account of all that. 
[passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Sami': Quantities of arms and explosives 
are seized whenever terrorist dens are attacked. Where do the 
extremists get these quantities of arms and explosives, when 
there are tight restrictions imposed on the arms trade and 
quarries? 
  Al-Alfi: A major part of them comes from the 
remnants of the past wars in Sinai. To this day we are still 
seizing dens in Sinai containing huge quantities of all types of 
arms, explosives, and ammunition. This is why a comprehensive 
survey of these areas has been launched to destroy this 
dangerous source, which is used by terrorists and other 
criminals. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, March 8 (AFP)--Sunni Muslim militants 
planted two bombs which exploded in the town hall and Shiite 
Muslim mosque of the Iranian town of Zahedan, the daily KAYHAN 
said Tuesday. 
  The paper did not say if the March 2 attack in the 
Sunni-majority town of southeast Iran close to the border with 
Pakistan caused any casualties or damage. 
  But it said security forces had arrested several members of 
the group "Sahab army" who had admitted responsibility for the 
attacks. 
  It was the first time that the fundamentalist Wahhabi group, 
which has close links to Saudi Arabia and is based in Pakistan, 
has been publicly blamed by Iranian authorities for an attack in 
Iran. 
  Numerous attacks on the Shiite community in Pakistan have 
been attributed to the group. 
  Zahedan, with 350,000 inhabitants, is one of the main Sunni 
towns in Iran, a country where 80 percent of the population is 
Shiite. 
  At least six people were killed in violent clashes between 
Sunni demonstrators and security forces in Zahedan last month 
during a protest against the destruction of a Sunni mosque in 
northeast Iran, reliable sources said. 
  The Iranian media has since January warned of the risk of 
attacks in the region by Wahhabi fundamentalists, charging that 
they were backed by Iran's main armed opposition movement, the 
Mojahedin-e Khalq.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, March 5 (AFP)--An Iraqi daily called for 
an alliance with Libya and Sudan on Saturday [5 March] to oppose 
"imperialism and Zionism" following the Hebron massacre. 
  The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest 
son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya 
and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common 
stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the 
February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens 
of Moslem worshippers. 
  Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete 
inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of 
traitors among the Arab leaders." 
  Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and 
called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to 
declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron."

  [Text] The triangle of death -- that is what the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] calls the area whose base is formed by a 
line between Gaza and Hebron and whose apex is the Ramalla 
district. This is the arena in which the five death squads of 
'Az a-din Elqasem, the military arm of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], operate. Since the signing of the Declaration of 
Principles by the PLO and Israel, the organization has murdered 
12 Israelis inside the triangle. 
  The five squads are composed of just 15 wanted men. Six of 
them, who operate on the West Bank, are residents of the Gaza 
Strip. Five others live in Hebron, two escaped four months ago 
from Dahariya Prison, and Ramalla is home to three of them, 
including 'Abd Almon'am abu-Hamir, who killed General Security 
Services [GSS] Coordinator No'am Cohen. The most wanted of the 
15 is 'Ali 'A'etzi, a resident of Kafr Bani Hasan, not far from 
Ari'el. Security officials announced this week that they believe 
that 'A'etzi and two other wanted men were the ones who murdered 
Tzipi Sason last weekend. 
  'Ali 'A'etzi, 30, has been active in the ranks of 'Az a-din 
Elqasem since the summer of 1992. With two of his accomplices, 
he staged an attack on an IDF unit at the Dir-Balut junction 
last August. His comrades were killed but he managed to get 
away. During the incident, Tomar David, of Kibbutz Manera, and 
Lev Pisahov, of Beit-She'an, were also killed. The GSS has been 
on his tail ever since. 
  'A'etzi has managed to evade a number of attempts to capture 
him, each in the nick of time. He joined up with a cell of Gaza 
residents with whom he has taken refuge most often in the 
Ramalla area -- in the homes of sympathizers, in mosques and in 
apartments rented by Hamas for that purpose. From time to time, 
on the basis of orders from Hamas' military command, he arms 
himself and goes out to kill, as he did last Friday on the 
Cross-Samaria highway. 
  The security agencies stated this week that they believe 
that 
Hamas will step up its terror attacks in the coming weeks. 
Preliminary signs have been seen recently in Hebron: wanted men 
of 'Az a-din Elqasem issued flyers, used loudspeakers and posted 
notices on walls declaring its intention to carry out a major 
attack and calling on the people of the city to collect food in 
anticipation of an extended curfew to follow. 
  Security officials believe that the latest attacks, 
especially the murder of a GSS agent, have raised the standing 
of the wanted men and Hamas in the territories. That fact 
heightens fears that they will attempt to translate the momentum 
of success into further terrorist actions. 
  The mass phenomenon of wanted men that characterized the 
intifadah for the previous two to three years no longer exists 
in the territories. At the peak of the intifadah, there were 
some 500 wanted men on the West Bank, most of them unarmed. They 
won widespread public sympathy and fearlessly went about in the 
villages and the streets of the refugee camps. The residents 
gave them shelter and refuge; most of them were street leaders. 
  Today, the IDF is engaged in a war against a well-defined 
and 
compact group. For the most part, it is the men of 'Az a-din 
Elqasem. Generally speaking, Fatah's wanted men on the West Bank 
receive a lower degree of attention. 
  Lt. Col. Nimrod, commander of the Ramalla region, says, "Our 
primary task right now throughout Judea and Samaria is catching 
the wanted men. Liquidating them is the only thing that will 
bring real security to the area." 
  The men wanted in the territories up until two years ago 
were 
small fry compared to the small group on which the security 
forces are now concentrating. They are all cut from the same 
cloth. The group's members are imbued with an extreme form of 
Islamic religious faith. They kill to fulfill religious 
commandments and are ready to sacrifice themselves. Islam 
promises them that such actions--including suicide 
missions--will grant them the key to eternal life in Paradise. 
  The makeup of the cells--both in Gaza and on the West 
Bank--makes them extremely dangerous. The Gazans are more 
radical and more daring. In general, they also are more skilled 
in executing operations. The six wanted Gazans are disciples of 
'Imad 'A'aqel, the commander of 'Az a-din Elqasem's cadres who 
was killed in Gaza about three months ago, and see themselves as 
carrying on for him. Their trigger fingers are lighter. 
  As members of Hamas' military arm, the wanted men of 'Az 
a-din Elqasem coordinate their actions with the movement's 
military commands and other armed bands. The commands see that 
they have money, weapons, guidance and other logistical 
support--such as automobiles and safe houses or contact men and 
helpers. 
  The 15 wanted men operate in small squads of three to four 
terrorists each. As a general matter, they do not stay long in 
any one hide-out. They shift from area to area, usually from one 
part to another of the Gaza-Hebron-Ramalla triangle. They 
generally travel in stolen Israeli automobiles bearing yellow 
Israeli license plates. 
  It is known from a number of sources that the terrorists 
often have stuck on their stolen cars stickers proclaiming 
slogans associated with the settlers, such as: "The people are 
with the Golan." On many occasions, they have walked the streets 
wearing skull caps or wigs on their heads. 
  Each of the wanted men apparently has a forged identity 
card. 
Usually, the card belongs to a Hamas supporter, the original 
holder's photo has been removed and the wanted man's picture 
affixed in its place. Some of the wanted men have more than one 
false identity card, some have Israeli identity cards provided 
by residents of east Jerusalem. 
  Thanks to the stolen cars and the identity cards, they roam 
the roads. Their guns are always close at hand in case of a 
problem at one of the checkpoints. To prevent surprises, they 
are careful to travel with assistance from helpers and contact 
men, who usually travel the route that the wanted men plan to 
take and make sure it is free of patrols, checkpoints and other 
IDF activities. Only then do the terrorists set out. 
  They usually travel with protection. Helpers drive ahead of 
the wanted men to warn of any possible danger or provide 
assistance as needed. The wanted men sometimes travel by taxi or 
bus. Such trips are usually considered safe in areas far from 
their homes where they are not known and unlikely to be 
identified. 
  The wanted men generally shuttle between the Gaza Strip and 
the West Bank. The trip is made through various ruses. The main 
problem is getting past the Gaza checkpoint. Entry into the Gaza 
Strip is usually easier because the Israelis are more careful 
with exit inspections. Reports reveal that in a number of 
instances, wanted Gazans operating in the West Bank have managed 
to get past the Erez checkpoint with their weapons hidden among 
crates of vegetables. 
  They find hiding places--leased apartments, a room with an 
activist in the organization, a room in a mosque or even a cave 
for a night's sleep--through contact men. These helpers are 
usually Hamas members among the students or the religious 
establishment. In January, a squad of four wanted men headed by 
Amjad Abu Halaf, one of Hamas' commanders in Hebron, was wiped 
out in a student room in the city. The house where they hid out 
was located near the student dormitories and leased from its 
owners by students from the university in Hebron. 
  One wanted man hid out in one of the villages in the Ramalla 
area in the house of an old woman. She got money from Hamas for 
helping a "student" without knowing his true identity. 
  Arms are not their biggest problem. It became clear this 
week 
that a single Kalashnikov is enough to slaughter six Israelis. 
Each Hamas wanted man has a personal weapon--usually a pistol, 
hand grenades or a "Karl Gustav" or Uzi sub-machine gun. 
Operational weapons--the Kalashnikov and the M-16, which are 
used for murder missions--are distributed among the squads 
according to plans drawn up by the command and in coordination 
with the planning of the murder. 
  Ballistics tests have also revealed that an M-16 rifle held 
by Hamas cells has periodically gone back and forth between the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank and been used in a plethora of 
terrorist attacks. The Galilon rifle that was the personal 
weapon of 'Imad 'A'aqel was seized three weeks ago after a 
shoot-out in Palestine Square in which one of the Hamas wanted 
men was killed. 
  Ballistics testing of the Galilon established that it was 
used in a large number of attacks in the Hebron area and the 
Gaza Strip. Bullets from it killed, to name just some, Lt. Col. 
Me'ir Mintz and three Druze Border Patrol officers, Wafa Asad, 
Ibrahim Shibel, and Mofa Abu-Shaykh. 
  Kalashnikovs, M-16's or Galils in working order are very 
difficult to obtain even in Gaza. The price of a rifle generally 
runs from 6,000 to 8,000 dinars (about 20,000 shekels). As a 
result, these rifles are not used as personal weapons by the 
squad members but left in caches between attacks. 
  IDF operations against the wanted men are based mainly on 
information and intelligence supplied by GSS coordinators. Such 
information can be obtained only through agents, in other words, 
collaborators. 'Abd Almona'im Alhamid Naji, the murderer of 
No'am Cohen, was such an agent. Over the years, he carried on a 
long affair with Hamas; now he is the GSS's number-one target. 
The newspaper ELIZATONA published at Bir Zeit University printed 
a photograph of 'Abd Almona'im on the front page as a "hero." 
  Every soldier beginning service in the territories these 
days 
receives a page with 15 pictures of faces under the heading: 
"Wanted Hamas Men in Judea and Samaria." The photo of 'Abd 
Almona'im appears in the first row. The troops are requested to 
memorize the names, descriptions, and other identifying marks of 
the fugitives for future identification. 
  Lt. Col. Nimrod: "We're putting a lot of time into 
operations 
designed to create contact with the wanted men. We close off 
areas without warning and stop suspicious cars at random." 
  "As part of this activity, we've formed closer ties to the 
police. The specifications of every car suspected of being 
stolen are immediately turned over to the police, who can get 
them from the computer within minutes." 
  The IDF's relentless pursuit is breathing down hard on the 
band of wanted men. Their homes are searched at night by the 
GSS. Pressure is put on their families to turn them in. 
Residents known as Hamas sympathizers are subjected to constant 
visits. Periodic searches are also made in mosques. On top of 
all that, undercover units have increased their activity. 
  The small number of wanted men, their ability to get by 
under 
difficult circumstances and their superb knowledge of the 
terrain hinder the vast manhunt for them. But they too, not just 
the IDF and the GSS, know that their days are numbered.

  [Text] The closure on the West Bank and Gaza is 
continuing, with Palestinians still banned from leaving for jobs 
inside Israel. Security sources told Qol Yisra'el it remains 
extremely difficult to protect the Jewish settlers living in 
Hebron. 
  Brigadier David Agmon, who investigated the Hebron massacre 
for the chief of staff, has confirmed that Barukh Goldstein was 
the only person to fire inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. His 
report, presented to the chief of staff at the weekend, also 
criticized security procedures at the site.

<F P=106> [Report from Washington by Hayim Shibi] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Clinton administration is close to deciding 
to place the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements on the list of terror 
organizations. [passage omitted] 
  If indeed the U.S. Justice Department decides to Place Kakh 
and Kahana Hay on the list of terror organizations -- the very 
membership in which constitutes a criminal act -- this would be 
the first time in U.S. history that Jewish organizations will be 
on that list, along with Arab terror organizations. 
  This might create a situation in which IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] reserve officers who, according to Kahana Hay leaders, 
conduct training camps for the organization members in the 
United States, might be listed as members of a terror 
organization and become a target of a criminal investigation by 
the FBI. 
  Mike Gozovsky, the Kahana Hay Movement spokesman, told our 
correspondent that the organization includes 8,000 members who 
pay annual membership fees of $36 each. A fund-raising dinner 
the movement organized in New York recently, was attended by 
some 500 people who paid $125 each. 
  Another serious problem that might arise if the 
organizations 
are listed with other terror organizations, would be that 
raising funds for them would be banned. Israeli sources in 
Washington view with concern the administration acceptance of 
the Palestinian request to hold up "fund-raising campaigns for 
extremists" in Israel. It is feared that a broad legal 
definition would create a dangerous precedent which will create 
difficulties for a wide range of fund- raising campaigns in the 
future. 
  It should be noted that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
Settlements Council, the City of Ari'el, and a series of Israeli 
public institutions have a regular fund-raising organ based in 
the United States. Americans also make donations to the belt 
neighborhoods around Jerusalem.

in the area and that they set up roadblocks and began campaigns 
in search of the other group members.

<F P=106> [Report by Bill Hutman] </F>
  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] yesterday 
threatened suicide attacks on several settlements if they aren't 
evacuated by March 15. 
  "The settlers of Qiryat Arba', Gush Qatif, Qedumim, Teqoa', 
and Ari'el must leave their settlements by March 15," Hamas's 
'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam military wing said in a leaflet. 
  "If they don't, we will not let them rest in their 
settlements or feel safe on the roads to their settlements." 
  It also warned that "the leaders of Israel will pay for 
their 
crimes sooner or later," and scoffed at the army's ability to 
prevent the attacks. 
  The leaflet, titled "The Settlers Will Pay with Their Blood 
for the Massacre," described a five-stage plan of attack. 
  "With each step we will make the Israeli people and settlers 
cry in blood for their dead, and let them know that our blood is 
not cheaper than theirs," the leaflet stated. "We have chosen 
our targets and our living martyrs have been instructed to carry 
out the suicide operations."

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman 
for the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has urged the other 
Palestinian forces and factions to develop a jihad and militant 
program to deal with settlers and Zionist occupation. 
  He said: The Zionist challenge forces all to confront this 
challenge. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions [Hamas military 
wing] have worked out a plan to deal with the phenomenon of 
settlement, the most dangerous phenomenon of occupation, which 
stands as the beginning of extending the Zionist entity to any 
land on which settlements are built. 
  In an interview with AL-DUSTUR, he said the jihad and 
struggle operations are not coordinated for pure security 
reasons. Each mujahid and struggling group plans and carries 
out its independent operations, but these operations should have 
specific objective and timing. 
  He added: We believe that Palestinian forces, whether they 
are 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, Fatah Hawks, the Red 
Eagle, or any another mujahid faction are asked to meet the 
demands of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic 
nations by taking revenge on criminal Zionists and give a clear 
signal to the world that the Jewish blood is not dearer than the 
Arab or Muslim blood. 
  Ghawshah was answering a question on coordination between 
the 
members of Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF], or between 
Fatah and Hamas, to retaliate against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. He said: There are some technical obstacles such as 
curfew, siege, and restrictions imposed by occupation. These 
measures may delay the retaliation, but certainly a good chance 
will come and should be used with full force, sacrifice, and 
determination. [passage omitted] 
  He concluded his interview by saying the APF will hold a 
meeting in Damascus on 20 March to discuss organizational and 
political issues. He said an APF delegation will be formed to 
visit the Libyan Jamahiriyah this month. The visit will be the 
beginning of other visits that will include a large number of 
Arab and Islamic countries, including Iran.

  [Excerpts] Amman-- [passage omitted] 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah 
Central Committee member, said: The massacre will not go 
unpunished. Instructions have been issued to the Fatah Hawks. 
However, these instructions have not been implemented yet 
because of the Israeli maximum state of alert in anticipation of 
a painful Palestinian response. 
  Complaining about the weak coordination among the joint 
commands in the occupied territories, Zaki said Fatah has made 
no decision to end the armed struggle against the occupation. 
He complained that the Palestinian factions are vying among 
themselves for positions in unions or professional federations 
in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but fail to vie to confront the 
Israeli occupation. 
  He said competition for positions has exposed many 
militants. 
He said Fatah means martyrdom, pride in martyrs, and the 
inevitability of the masses' victory. [passage omitted]

ostracized when Rabbi Kahana was banned from being a Knesset 
member and when our list was prohibited from running in the 
Knesset elections. We are under serious pressure. I have the

  These remarks were made yesterday by a member of the Kahana

such an action were to take place within the walls of the 
Knesset, whose members blackball and persecute us. Look what 
one Jew did, and how effective it is." 
  At around 2100 last night, an anonymous caller phoned 
MA'ARIV 
and said that "500 Arabs would be slaughtered if Binyamin Kahana 
was not released from his prison cell in Hadera by midnight." 
  A check by MA'ARIV revealed that a similar anonymous phone 
call was received by the duty officer at the Hadera police 
station. The Hadera police have launched an investigation.

  [Text] The State Security Court's public prosecutor has 
begun to interrogate 30 defendants in connection with the recent 
bombings in Amman and al-Zarqa' [see 9 February Terrorism 
Report] as a prelude to trying them before the State Security 
Court soon. 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that preliminary investigations 
have shown that these defendants received aid from a foreign 
country and were trained in the use of weapons in Afghanistan. 
They planned to carry out acts of sabotage in the Kingdom in 
order to destabilize the country and obstruct Jordan's 
democratic march. 
  The public prosecutor accused all defendants of possessing 
and using explosives and automatic weapons and joining an 
illegal organization. It is noteworthy that the competent 
security organs recently confiscated some weapons and explosives 
in the possession of these defendants.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jordan Accuses `Foreign Parties' of </F>
Financing `Afghans' and Planning Explosions"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior Jordanian 
security source has accused foreign parties of perpetrating the 
explosions that have recently occurred and continue to occur in 
Jordan, but he emphasized that these parties are neither states 
nor governments. 
  The source's statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT came after the 
discovery of five bombs in an area west of the capital Amman. 
The source said that foreign parties, now known to the security 
authorities, are behind the explosions and are linked to 
incidents which have occurred in more than one Arab country, and 
are currently providing aid for the so-called "Afghan Arabs." 
He added that the "Afghan" leader now detained and under 
interrogation with his group in Jordan is 45 years old and a 
resident of al-Baq'ah refugee camp north of Amman, and that most 
members of that organization come from that camp. 
  On the five hand grenades found by the security authorities, 
he said that they were of the U.S. M-26 type and were hidden in 
a plastic bag when they were discovered near the industrial area 
adjacent to the Civil Defense Department in the area of Bayadir 
Wadi al-Sayr west of Amman. 
  The source did not rule out the possibility that they were 
planted by "Jordanian Afghans" particularly as they were similar 
to the devices used in previous explosions. He said that a 
security commission has been formed to investigate and find out 
the source of these bombs and why they were planted in that area 
close to the Civil Defense Department building. 
  A citizen had told the security authorities that as he was 
walking around in his workshop close to the Civil Defense 
Department, he discovered the bombs in a plastic bag, and called 
in the explosives experts to defuse them.

<F P=106> [Nidal Mansur report: "Security Official Reveals the Story </F>
of Explosion in Jordan; Usamah Bin-Ladin of Saudi Arabia 
Finances Bombing Operations"] 
  [Excerpts] [introductory passage omitted] A security 
official told SHIHAN that the explosions at the Rivoli and Salva 
theaters were not the first of their kind. The bombings began 
at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee camp] in 1988. The 
security official, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained 
his viewpoint on the details of the bombings. He said: The 
plan, which was drawn up by the 30 defendants, most of whom 
received training and lived in Afghanistan, goes back to 1988. 
That is the year in which the explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema 
in al-Baq'ah took place. However, the repeated travel by their 
leaders to Afghanistan and the Philippines, and the discovery of 
'Muhammad's Army', which carried out similar acts, prompted 
those individuals to suspend their activities in Jordan. 
  The security official continues: Some of those who returned 
from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the 
Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to 
do with their acts. He indicated that this "organization," if 
one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first, 
which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk 
Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as 
well as the first group. [as published]. 
  The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul 
al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader 
of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the 
second man in the organization. The security official revealed 
that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad 
and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks 
to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption. 
He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the 
defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was 
opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also 
targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that 
they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious 
duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force 
by bombing operations. 
  The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was 
not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters. 
An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush 
stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee 
camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at 
the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations 
revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target. 
Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate 
political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace 
delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not 
among them because they could not monitor his movements, but 
they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian 
and Palestinian delegations. 
  The security official revealed that the defendants 
intensified their activities during the month of January this 
year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a 
Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to 
visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers 
of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a 
wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for 
supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was 
a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of 
the Jordanian Afghans. 
  On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and 
what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants 
had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are 
responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the 
defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening 
in Egypt and Algeria. 
  He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against 
them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for 
making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly 
explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine 
guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the 
fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest 
of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues 
were arrested. 
  The security official suggested a link between this 
organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's 
Army. However, he said that there is an organizational 
interconnection, but not organizational relations between the 
two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were 
members of Muhammad's Army. 
  On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered, 
the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant 
'Id al- Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At 
first, he was moved with the other injured people who were 
inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions 
about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger. 
Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he 
was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the 
explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while 
before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching 
the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official 
said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out 
the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali 
Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised 
all the bombing operations. 
  The security official concluded by affirming that the 
judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and 
that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He 
refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He 
merely said that "they are being held in an officially 
recognized prison."

<F P=106> [By Yasir Abu-Hilalah] </F>
  [Excerpt] An arrest in al-Qasr in al-Karak governorate has 
raised many questions about what is wanted from Jordan, in 
general, and from the Islamic institutions, in particular. The 
following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of 
witnesses: 
  Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid 
in 
al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small 
carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to 
guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando 
operation against Jews from southern Jordan. 
  'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed. 
The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to 
keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton 
elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a 
mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society. 
Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did 
not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the 
carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al- Majid hid the carton 
inside a storage room that is separate from the house. 
  After that day's fast-breaking meal, a group from the 
security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the 
place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the 
place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they 
arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security 
procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed 
the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of 
many witnesses. 
  When the security forces made inquiries, the school's 
administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed 
that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people. 
  The incident did not answer the following questions: How did 
the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security 
forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that 
same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic 
institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why 
weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants' 
houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this 
incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on 
security issues? [passage omitted on the Islamic Center 
Society's social works]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Over 470 children at al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten 
in al-Qasr town, al-Karak Governorate, did not know that they 
were at the mercy of huge amounts of explosives, bombs, and 
ammunition hidden in their kindergarten. Children were 
terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday 
before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the 
kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn 
that their innocent children could have been killed at any 
moment. 
  Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [5 March; as 
published], the security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M. 
and 'Imad S. [not further identified] less than an hour after 
the two hid large quantities of machine guns, weapons, and 
ammunition in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten 
is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society, which, as is well 
known, is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood group. 
  Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the 
story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh 
of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for 
involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released. 
  The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the 
mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within 
the mosque building. He was also working at an Education 
Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who 
teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were 
hidden. 
  According to information made available to AL-BILAD, 
'Abd-al- 
Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He then 
asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the latter 
suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The explosives 
were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the imam. The 
kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten. 
  Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman 
was under close watch by security agencies. After the 
explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were 
closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest 
'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes 
before the call to the evening prayer in al- Yarut village, near 
al-Qasr. 
  From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked 
to 
find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme 
the "Jordanian Afghans" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim 
militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute 
outside Amman. 
  Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves 
moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and 
districts since the security agencies have gained full control 
over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves 
concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are 
controlled by the Islamists. 
  According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of 
the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence 
officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the 
various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a 
large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic 
security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens. 
  Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security 
agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine 
guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom, 
including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite 
sticks were found. 
  Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is 
involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these 
operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between 
the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by 
the same state. 
  The final number of the "Afghans" arrested thus far in the 
bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed 
sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few 
days. 
  AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache 
was 
discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained 
detailed information from the residents of the area and informed 
sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as 
we have said, one of the major operations planned by the 
Jordanian Afghans. 
  The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is 
that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center 
Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden 
less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of 
children. This means that these children could have been killed 
at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of 
these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the 
townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the 
kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the 
scheme was thoroughly planned. 
  AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked 
was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which 
is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the 
Muslim Brotherhood. 
  Residents of the area have not observed any strong 
connection 
between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions 
of an organizational link between them. 
  In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other 
people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were 
arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures 
are available yet on those arrested. 
  In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a 
plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on 
the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those 
arrested in these cases. 
  It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not 
yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a 
kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they 
think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, controller </F>
general of the Muslim Brotherhood in Amman; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-SABIL] We have learned that some arrests 
were made within the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. 
How true is this and what is the reason for the arrests? 
  [Khalifah] [passage omitted] What we know so far is that one 
of the brothers in the Suwaylih branch of the Islamic 
Brotherhood was arrested. His name is 'Abd- al-Majid Dayah and 
he is an engineer. Everything I know about him is good. 
  Another person, named 'Abd-al-Majid Ibrahim al-Majali, is 
one 
of the brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood of al-Qasr in 
al-Karak. He was questioned a few months ago when he wanted to 
leave Jordan in order to join the ranks of the mujahidin against 
the communists in Afghanistan. He was held for some time on 
charges of carrying an amount of money to help the mujahidin in 
Afghanistan. At the time, he was not a regular member of the 
Muslim Brotherhood. He was released a few months later. I do 
not remember how long he was detained. [passage omitted] 
  The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and in the other Arab 
countries have not changed their clear policy toward the 
Palestinian cause since the establishment of their call, 
although in Islam one greets another by saying: peace be upon 
you. We can never believe that the Jews want peace with the 
inhabitants of Palestine or with the other Arabs. The Muslim 
brothers clearly know this fact, and are also aware of the Jews 
wickedness, machinations, and enmity toward Islam and its 
followers. 
  From this premise, if Palestine is not purged of the filth 
of 
the Jews, it will remain a Trojan horse the colonialist 
countries in Europe and America will use to return colonialism 
to the Arab countries in general, and the Islamic countries in 
particular. The United States has succeeded in arming the state 
of the usurper Jews in Palestine and has transformed it into an 
aircraft carrier to subdue the Arab and Islamic countries. 
Conceding any part of Palestine to the Jews is banned by Islam. 
The jurisprudence based on the Koran and the Sunna stipulates 
the following: If the enemy steps on a single inch of Muslim 
land, every male and female Muslim is duty bound to carry out 
jihad. The woman can even leave her husband's house without his 
permission and the slave without his master's permission. The 
Muslim Brotherhood and others who preach Islam will be 
renouncing their religion if they agree to give any part of 
Palestine to the Jews or the other enemies of God. Palestine and 
Jerusalem can be liberated only if the Arab countries unite and 
adopt a cohesive stand with the other Islamic countries. The 
Jews know this. 
  Therefore, any rumor or machination against the Muslim 
Brotherhood cannot but originate from the Jewish enemy, its 
agents, and its partners in Europe and America. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers, which met from 1100 to 
1500 today under the chairmanship of President Ilyas al-Hirawi 
and attended by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and the 
ministers, has decided to reinstate the law providing for the 
death penalty for those convicted of premeditated murder, and to 
extend this punishment to those who kill for political motives. 
  The Council referred to the Chamber of Deputies a host of 
draft laws designed to facilitate judicial work. These include 
an amendment of legal procedures with a view to shortening trial 
periods and speeding up interrogations in murder cases.

  [Text] According to our correspondent in Tyre, clashes 
involving the use of machine guns and hand grenades occurred in 
al- Rashidiyah refugee camp at dawn today between personnel 
belonging to the pro-'Arafat Fatah and others from the 
pro-Abu-Nidal Fatah-the Revolutionary Council. Four pro-'Arafat 
personnel were injured in the clashes, including Major Abu-'Ali, 
deputy to the official in charge of military affairs in the 
camp, and his wife. The casualties were taken to a hospital in 
the camp. 
  Meanwhile, an explosion was heard in the Khirbat Silm 
village 
last night when unidentified men hurled a bundle of dynamite 
sticks in front of a small mosque. Tension prevailed in the 
village in the past two days in the wake of clashes between Amal 
Movement members and Hizballah militants after two cars and a 
home belonging to Amal members were bombed.

<F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, March 9 (AFP)--New tactics and weapons are 
the secret to the Iranian-backed Hizballah's success in 
inflicting heavier losses on Israeli and allied militiamen in 
south Lebanon while suffering fewer casualties. 
  A month after killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding 
five, Hizballah guerrillas on Monday [7 March] launched a series 
of bomb attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA), 
killing 10 militiamen and wounding 12. 
  A senior intelligence officer was among those killed, but 
Hizballah reported no casualties on its side. 
  "Monday's operations were specifically aimed at eliminating 
Israel's main intelligence agents," Shaykh Nabil Qawuq who is 
among those in charge of Hizballah operations in south Lebanon, 
told AFP on Tuesday. 
  "They are part of a series of operations to sow chaos among 
SLA ranks," he said, adding that more than 100 SLA militiamen 
had deserted over the past year. 
  Military experts and sources close to the Shiite Moslem 
fundamentalists said Hizballah's operations in recent months 
were more professional and homed in on specific Israeli or SLA 
targets to avoid retaliation against civilians. 
  The guerrillas were also using more sophisticated weapons. 
  Their arsenal now includes Russian-made Sagger anti-tank 
rockets known for their precision, which are increasingly being 
used against moving targets, a Western military source said. 
  Hizballah has had "very good results" with the rockets, said 
the source, who declined to be named. 
  An SLA official said that Hizballah guerrillas were also 
using a new type of roadside bomb that "is shaped like rocks and 
painted in earthy colours." 
  He said the bombs were Iranian-made or upgraded by Iran and 
that they were capable of jamming Israeli radars. Hizballah 
also uses Katyusha rockets and mortars. 
  Sources close to the fundamentalists have said the new 
tactics evolved two months ago with the arrival in Lebanon of a 
new team of Iranian Revolutionary Guards to oversee and 
coordinate the anti- Israeli operations. 
  They include a new head for the Revolutionary Guards and an 
Iranian official known by his first name only, 'Abbas, who is 
said to be in charge of Hizballah's military operations, the 
sources said. 
  Around 200 Revolutionary Guards, clerics and social workers 
are based in Lebanon's eastern al-Biqa' Valley, where they were 
first deployed following Israel's 1982 invasion. 
  Hizballah has meanwhile transferred its military positions 
out of the al-Biqa' city of Ba'labakk to areas closer to the 
border with Syria and switched its activities in the region to 
social work and construction. 
  Fundamentalist sources said these steps were part of a 
campaign by Hizballah to improve its domestic image after 
winning eight parliamentary seats in the 1992 elections. 
  "They are also focusing more and more on helping their 
supporters to set up private businesses as part of an effort to 
forge a new image for the movement," a reliable source said. 
  "Hizballah has become more diplomatic since the 1992 
elections. They no longer terrorize people," the source added. 
  Hizballah leader Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah said last month his 
organisation was "not only a military movement. We have popular 
roots everywhere."

  [Text] A military source has stated that at about 0900 
today, according to a tip by a citizen, Lebanese Army units 
found an explosive charge containing six kg of explosives packed 
like a present and placed near the French Cultural Center in the 
township of Ghadir in Kasrawan. The units cordoned off the area 
and a military expert defused the charge in coordination with 
the Internal Security Forces. It should be recalled that 
certain people earlier protested the decision to close down the 
French Cultural Center and move it to another area.

  [Excerpts] Juniyah, Lebanon, March 9 (AFP)--The Lebanese 
army defused a gift-wrapped bomb outside the French cultural 
center in the heart of Lebanon's Christian community on 
Wednesday, fuelling fears of further attacks ahead of the pope's 
visit. [passage omitted] 
  The bomb was found by Chantal Mansur, a teacher at the 
center, who alerted the army, the French embassy charge 
d'affaires Bernard Letourneau told AFP. [passage omitted] 
  But Letourneau denied any plans to close down the center, 
which served as a consulate during the early days of Lebanon's 
15-year civil war. 
  He said the building was owned by the Maronite Catholic 
Sisters of the Holy Family, and they were renegotiating the 
lease which expires in 1995. 
  "I don't know who the target was, the sisters or us. But it 
seems that this is the latest in a series of unfortunate 
attacks," he said referring to the February 27 church bombing. 
  Letourneau added he had instructed the directors of all 
French cultural centers and schools in Lebanon "to be vigilant." 
  An AFP photographer said army troops were stationed outside 
the center after the incident. 
  Secretary General of the right-wing Phalange Party Karim 
Paqraduni -- which was devastated by a car-bomb in December 
which killed three and wounded 100 -- said he expected more 
attacks. 
  "Thank God, today's attack was aborted. But I expect more 
bombings. They are part of a cycle which is aimed at the 
destabilisation of peace in Lebanon," Paqraduni told AFP. 
  "Christians feel they are the victims of such terrorist acts 
and these attacks will continue as long as the assailants go 
unpunished." he added. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Warrant Officer Muhammad al-Dada, a military 
expert in the Lebanese Army, dismantled an explosive device that 
was placed at the entrance of the French Cultural Center in the 
town of Ghadir in Kasrawan at 0900 today. 
  According to available information, the device was placed by 
two unidentified persons in their twenties who were driving a 
black BMW around the center. The central security forces 
arrested the two persons for interrogation. It turned out that 
they had maps of Juniyah and neighboring areas. A third person 
was taken in for interrogation by the security agencies. 
  The gift-wrapped device was six kg of a highly-explosive 
material, equal to 25 kg of TNT, and was placed at the main 
entrance to the center. [passage omitted] 
  The French Foreign Ministry announced a short while ago that 
Paris and the Lebanese authorities are considering the 
possibility of adopting security measures to protect French 
interests in Lebanon. The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed 
out that the targeted cultural center will resume its activity 
as usual. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Qutbi al-Mahdi, Sudanese </F>
ambassador in Iran with unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI 
correspondent in Tehran--date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted on civil war] [JOMHURI-YE 
ESLAMI] Do you really foresee military intervention by 
foreigners? 
  Al-Mahdi: We do not consider it unlikely that the 
forces of arrogance may embark on such folly. If they find the 
conditions favorable, they will certainly intervene, since they 
are already poised against Sudan. The propaganda by the Western 
mass media, the United Nations, the UN Human Rights Commission, 
as well as their economic embargo, are all indications of an 
intervention by the forces of world arrogance. I stress: If 
they find suitable conditions, they will certainly intervene. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Two weeks ago, a mosque was 
attacked in Omdurman, Khartoum by armed assailants and some 
worshipers were killed and wounded. What group was responsible 
and what were its objectives? 
  Al-Mahdi: Those who were arrested were mostly 
foreigners; this shows the nature of this act. What motive can 
there be for attacking worshipers? The attack on the residence 
of Shaykh 'Usamah bin-Ladin and against the Islamic al-Da'wah 
party's headquarters is a clear indication of the identity of 
the attackers. Such incidents usually have some political 
motivation. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Why was the mosque attacked? 
  Al-Mahdi: The objective of the attackers was to 
foment agitation, unrest, and instability. [passage omitted] 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Do you see any foreign hands 
behind this attack? 
  Al-Mahdi: The remarks by Government officials 
indicate that foreign hands were involved, but the complete 
report on the investigation has not been released. The issue is 
being followed up. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Sudan is currently facing the 
hostile stance of the United States and the West. How do you 
assess the attitude of the West and the United States toward 
Sudan? 
  Al-Mahdi: The West and the United States cannot 
bear to hear calls for liberation. They are seeking to plunder 
and pillage the wealth of the people of the world. They wish to 
strangle every cry for freedom; and this is the policy they 
follow. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: What is Sudan's stance toward 
the world's Islamic movements? 
  Al-Mahdi: Our message to the Muslim nations 
is--and we hope that they get this message--we approve of all 
acts in the service of Islam. The powers of world arrogance 
have besieged the nations. Thus it is the duty of Islamic 
movements that they all should join hands; and our relations 
with these movements are strong. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: The Egyptian and Algerian 
regimes have accused Sudan of giving refuge to the Arab Muslims 
who fought in Afghanistan. They say that Sudan is giving them 
military training. What are the objectives of these regimes in 
making such accusations? 
  Al-Mahdi: Sudan has no problems with Egypt and 
Algeria and our relations with their people are cordial. 
However we believe in differentiating between the people and 
the governments. The lackeys are the ones leveling such 
baseless charges against Sudan. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Who are these lackeys? 
  Al-Mahdi: The Western lackeys who rule over these 
governments and are at loggerheads with their own people. They 
wish to label Sudan in order to cover up their own weakness. 
They are pitted against their own people, not against 
terrorism. They cannot face reality and therefore are using 
Sudan as a pretext. 
  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: How are relations between 
Sudan and the Egyptian Government? 
  Al-Mahdi: The Egyptian Government has occupied 
the area of Hala'ib and is seeking to avoid talks on this 
subject. It continues to plot against us. The Egyptian mass 
media have started a propaganda war against Sudan. However we 
believe that the Egyptian people are closer to us and that Egypt 
and Sudan have a common destiny and interests. We belong to the 
same ummah and we will strive to maintain cordial ties with the 
Egyptian people and to counteract the maneuvers of the enemy.

  [Text] The St.Petersburg interior board predicts a sharp 
increase in the number of hostage seizures and terrorist acts, 
the head of the regional board for combat against organized 
crime Sergey Sidorenko told INTERFAX. 
  Last year the interior board servicemen liberated 47 
hostages, including 6 children. During the past two months 12 
hostages have been liberated. In the meantime, Sidorenko 
believes that criminals actually seize at least twice as many 
people. 
  In his opinion, an increase in hostages in the near future 
will be caused by the aggravating competition among criminal 
gangs for the spheres of influence in St. Petersburg. In this 
connection, Sidorenko noted a considerable rise in illegal arms 
supplies. According to him, since the beginning of this year, 
the regional board for combat against organized crime has 
confiscated about 70 firearms, supplied mainly from Estonia. 
Sidorenko pointed out that it is difficult to trace arms 
supplies due to the lack of cooperation with the police of the 
Baltic states. "Sometimes it is easier for us to cooperate with 
FBI and Scotland Yard than with the Baltic states' police," he 
noted.

administration of the Dyurtyulinsky district a week ago, was 
killed on Wednesday morning in an explosion of the bomb planted 
at the door of his house.

  [Text] As a result of a terrorist act, Razil Musin, deputy 
chairman of the Republic of Bashkortostan's Supreme Soviet, 
perished this morning. An explosive device went off when he 
left his home for work. 
  Our correspondent Abrek Baykov reports from Ufa that Deputy 
Internal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Shabrin believes that this 
was a contract killing. 
  A week ago Razil Musin was appointed to the post of head of 
administration of Dyurtyuli rayon by a personal decision of the

leaders. 
  An investigation of the murder is under way.

  [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS - The Russian Foreign Ministry 
received a bomb threat on Thursday and employees are being 
evacuated from the building in downtown Moscow, according to a 
spokesman of the Moscow Counterintelligence Department. 
  "Yes, there is such information. Measures are being taken. 
Evacuation is under way. Details will be reported later," the 
spokesman told CRIME-PRESS news agency. 
  The first alarm was sounded at 15.30 hours (1230 GMT) when

had heard rumours that a bomb had been planted in the building 
and accused top officials of concealing the danger.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Mar -- A CRIME-PRESS correspondent was 
just informed at the press-service of the Moscow Directorate of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service that special units have 
thoroughly checked the premises of the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs with the help of special equipment to find the 
explosive device. Fortunately, the alarm was false: there is no 
bomb. 
  Nevertheless, the quick and efficient evacuation of 
personnel 
has proved that Russian diplomats keep their cool under any 
circumstances.

  [Text] Tbilisi, March 10 (AFP) -- Explosions rocked central 
Tbilisi Thursday [10 March], killing at least two people and 
wrecking a military headquarters and a tax office, the Interior 
Ministry said. 
  Two other people were hurt and more could be buried under 
the 
ruins of the headquarters of the Mkhedrioni (knights), a former 
militia now part of the regular armed forces, where the 
strongest blast occurred, the ministry said. 
  Three smaller explosions occurred at the main tax department 
in the city. 
  Georgia, which in two years has seen a coup and two civil 
wars, is currently the theatre of a power struggle between the 
Security and Defence Ministries as well as uncontrolled banditry. 
  The Mkhedrioni, loyal to the president of the Georgian 
emergency committee, Djaba Iosseliani, had one of their regional 
officers killed at the end of January. 
  On February 3, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in 
Tbilisi, Deputy Defence Minister Nikolai Kekelidze was killed by 
a bomb at his home, and Defence Minister Georgi Karkarashvili 
was wounded by a second blast while visiting the scene.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 11 Mar -- Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy 
chairman of the republican Supreme Soviet, described the murder 
of Moyonsho Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the Tajikistan 
Council of Ministers, as "a planned terrorist act." 
  Let me remind you that the 64-year-old Nazarshoyev, a native 
of Gornyy Badakhshan, was shot with an automatic weapon last 
night by unknown persons, in the courtyard of his own home. 
Twenty bullets were fired at him. The criminals escaped. 
  The deputy parliamentary speaker said today in an exclusive 
interview to an ITAR-TASS correpondent that it was an attempt to 
destabilize the social and political situation in the region, to 
wreck the process of peaceful political dialogue between the 
republic's official authorities and representatives of the 
opposition. 
  A senior source in the Tajik Government, who wishes to 
remain 
anonymous, said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that he does not rule out that there will be a series of 
terrorist and subversive acts in the republic against well-known 
political figures and against the general public in the 
immediate future. He said "a kind of `fifth column' opposition 
exists in the Tajik capital and its suburbs numbering many 
hundreds." Recently, "Tajikistan's special services got hold of 
a coded message from representatives of the so-called 
irreconcilable opposition in Afghanistan recommending that 
terrorist acts against the Tajik leadership be stepped up."

  [Text] Dushanbe March 11 TASS -- The procurator's office of 
Tajikistan on Friday circulated a statement about the atrocious 
assassination of the republic's vice-premier Moyonsho 
Nazarshoyev. 
  The statement points out that the assassination was 
"committed in the Tajik capital by two members of an anti-state 
criminal gang headed by Mullo Kasym." 
  The assassins fled from the scene of the crime. On their way 
they stopped an oncoming VAZ-469 car being driven by a 
policeman. The criminals seized the policeman's gun and 
inflicted gunshot wounds on him. Later on the criminals 
attacked a food-laden truck, brutally beat its driver and rode 
the vehicle in the direction of Semiganch village of Kofarnikhon 
District. 
  The law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan brought it to the 
notice of the general public that Said Abdullah Nuri, leader of 
a self-proclaimed "government-in-exile," who is now in 
Afghanistan, had urged individual groups, who avoid prosecution 
for particularly grave crimes against their state to put 
vigorous pressure on the Tajik Government in order to 
destabilise the socio-political situation in the republic and 
fan up ethnic strife by using measures of intimidation, terror 
and physical removal of persons unwelcome to the opposition, 
particulary democratic-minded people and to work out plans for 
armed actions and other acts of sabotage. 
  The Tajikistan prosecutor-general's office has instituted 
criminal proceedings against the assassins of the vice-premier. 
A manhunt for the assassins was launched.

<F P=106> [Report by Kemal Yurteri: "Drug Trafficking Shifts to </F>
Ports"] 
  [Excerpts] Ankara--Developments in the Balkan countries and 
the Caucasus have forced the drug traffickers to make 
significant changes in the routes they use to transport their 
narcotics from Turkey to Western Europe and from Western Europe 
to North America. While narcotics were smuggled into Turkey from 
Iran and Syria in the past, the drug traffickers are also 
bringing in supplies from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan at the present time. It is common knowledge that 
they used the "Balkan route" to transport their narcotics to 
Europe in the past. However, the recent use of ports in drug 
trafficking has drawn attention. It has been reported that even 
the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has complied with the changes in 
transportation routes and moved to intensify its activities in 
Italy and Greece. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the PKK, the report said: "It has been ascertained 
that the PKK will maintain its underground activities, intensify 
its drug trafficking operations, take harsh steps to continue to 
extort funds, and shift its activities from wherever it is 
banned to neighboring countries (particularly to those that have 
a coastline). The obstruction of PKK's activities in the 
countries in which that organization is banned will be 
impossible if its members are not expelled."

  [Text] Dusseldorf (DDP/ADN) -- In the marathon trial of 
members of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the 
Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court today sentenced two of the four 
accused to life imprisonment. They were charged with attempted 
joint murder, several counts of joint murder, and in one case of 
being the ringleader of a terrorist organization. Another 
defendant was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for three 
counts of joint unlawful detention and membership of a terrorist 
organization. The fourth defendant received a six-year prison 
sentence for membership of a terrorist organization. The 
charges of joint murder against these two defendants were 
dropped by the court. The trial began in October 1989.

  [Text] A Limassol car bomb yesterday blasted two vehicles 
and blew in the windows of a house. 
  But the early morning bomb injured no-one. 
  It exploded under the car of Andreas Kharalambous who had 
parked outside his home. 
  The homemade dynamite bomb extensively damaged Kharalambous' 
Metro and his daughter's car which was parked nearby. 
  The windows of his house were also smashed in the explosion 
which could be heard all over Limassol. 
  Kharalambous is chief health inspector for the Limassol 
municipality. 
  He had no idea who was responsible for the attack, adding 
that he had no differences with anyone and had never been 
threatened. 
  But police spokesman Andreas Kariolaimos said officers were 
investigating whether the attack could have been due to 
professional differences. 
  Other police sources said suspicions are aimed at one 
specific person working with Kharalambous. 
  Attempts to secure an arrest warrant against the suspect 
have 
failed, said the source, due to insufficient evidence.

  [Excerpt] Wiesbaden/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- The Office of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor has rejected the view of members of 
the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] 
that the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF) has ceased to exist in 
its former form and as a single entity. The RAF has not given 
up its armed struggle, Rolf Hannich, deputy spokesman for the 
Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor said on Monday in an 
interview with DPA. At the same time, he warned against assuming 
that the RAF no longer constitutes a terrorist threat. 
  It is true that in late October 1993, the majority of RAF 
prisoners, the so-called hard-liners around Brigitte Mohnhaupt, 
left the RAF. Nevertheless, one cannot assume that the RAF has 
given up its fight against the state. On the contrary, in its 
last command declaration of 2 November 1993, the RAF made it 
clear that it continues to be active as a terrorist group. One 
must assume that, despite the arrest in Bad Kleinen, the RAF 
remains capable of taking action, Hannich said. Hence, attacks 
have to be expected from the RAF command level in the future, 
too. 
  Hannich thus rejected an assessment by the Bavarian Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution that the RAF had ceased 
to exist as a single entity. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mili's Explosive Dance on the Ice"] </F>
  [Text] According to findings by the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigations (BKA) in Wiesbaden, the feminist 
extremist group "Red Zora," which was responsible for several 
bomb and arson attacks in 1987, is planning new acts of violence. 
  An internal BKA report quotes a strategy paper by "Red 
Zora." 
It announces "illegal militant organizing" to "destroy 
patriarchal power." 
  In a 38-page underground brochure entitled "Mili's Dance on 
the Ice," "Red Zora," which went underground in August 1988, is 
now again calling for attacks and punishment actions against 
persons and institutions that it holds responsible for the 
oppression of women, as the BKA analysis says. 
  In 1978, "Red Zora" attracted attention for the first time 
with attacks on sex shops. In 1984, there followed attacks on 
genetic laboratories and the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  In 1987, "Red Zora," which, according to the chief federal 
prosecutor's office, is an underground organization of the "Red 
Cells," set fire to the mother company of the Adler clothing 
company in Haibach near Aschaffenburg and another seven 
subsidiaries of the company. 
  At that time, the textile corporation was accused by "Red 
Zora" of exploiting women in South Korea.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Office for the Protection of the </F>
Constitution Fears Political Murders"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin security authorities are 
preparing for a "hot and bloody" spring. According to a 
confidential analysis of the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, an escalation of violence is imminent in the 
German capital. Above all an increase in the number of 
political murders has to be expected, the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution warned the Berlin Senat and the 
police. 
  The background of the alarming assessment of the situation 
is 
the formation of a new "trend" in the autonomous scene in 
Berlin. According to information of DIE WELT, it "is offensively 
advocating that the killing of fascists be deliberately accepted 
now when they are attacked." 
  The authorities fear massive riots, particularly in 
connection with the international soccer match between Germany 
and England. It is supposed to take place in Berlin on 20 
April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. In the scene paper INTERIM (no. 
274) it is stated that the match planned "on the Fuehrer's 
birthday in the stadium built by the Fuehrer in the capital of 
the Fuehrer's Reich" is a provocation. 
  INTERIM takes the view that the politically responsible 
persons want to use the opportunity to provoke riots "for the 
benefit of the 'law-and-order' policy in the election year." As 
the homes of refugees had to burn after the abolition of the 
asylum-law, Berlin has to burn now. It continues literally: 
"There must not be such an unspeakable alliance with a 
concentration of fascist groups of thugs, hooligans from the FRG 
and England who are prepared for violence, thousands of heavily 
armed cops, and riots in the surroundings of the stadium and far 
beyond it: Let us prevent the match!" 
  Independently of these calls, extreme-left "groups of 
migrants" are currently also canvassing for an FRG-wide 
demonstration in Berlin on 20 April. They want to "strike back" 
against the "Nazis." 
  And this is the definition of their terrorist position: "We 
are living in hostile surroundings. It is not surprising that a 
fascist might also be killed in a climate that it politically 
heated by racist pogroms and oppression." 
  The authorities estimate the number of autonomous persons 
who 
are prepared for violence at more than 5,000 in the FRG. They 
continue to be concentrated in the conurbations of Berlin, 
Hamburg, Frankfurt/Main, and the Ruhr area.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has 
concluded its investigation of the contentious antiterrorism 
operation in Bad Kleinen and, as a result, primarily wants to 
restructure the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA]. 
[passage omitted] 
  BKA President Zachert stressed his agreement with the 
minister on plans for an organizational reform of the BKA. Many 
measures, which are now to be implemented, had been discussed 
long before the operation. Kanther cited the reduction to nine 
departments, the merging of the departments for left-wing and 
right-wing terrorism in the BKA branch in Meckenheim (near 
Bonn), and a more intensive delegation of the president's 
international obligations to subordinate officials. [passage 
omitted] 
  Nehm rejected reports that liaison man Klaus Steinmetz, who 
was uncovered during the operation, was a member of the RAF 
command structure [see previous Terrorism Report]. His 
authority had a corresponding note from the BKA, but the 
suspicion had proved to be incorrect during subsequent 
investigations, the chief federal prosecutor said. The 
questions that had been raised have been "answered in such a way 
that no criminal accusations against Steinmetz were made."

  [Excerpts] With every passing month, Spaniards are becoming 
more pessimistic about the future of Spain in general, but they 
are moderately optimistic about their personal situation. So 
says a study by the Bilbao Vizcaya Bank [BBV] Foundation titled 
"Tendencias sociales en Espana (1960-1990)" that was released 
yesterday in Madrid. [passage omitted] 
  Terrorism, which in the early 1980's was described by half 
of 
all Spaniards as one of the country's three biggest problems, is 
now of urgent concern to only one out of four Spaniards 
surveyed. The fading concern about terrorism is counterbalanced 
by increasing alarm about crime. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by </F>
Jose Maria Brunet; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] [Brunet] What 
circumstances define the antiterrorist struggle at the beginning 
of 1994? 
  Asuncion: We are undoubtedly faring better. A 
great deal of progress has been made in the public response to 
violence in the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for 
society to reject this, and for the parties, despite the 
wrenches which may be thrown in the works, to maintain their 
consensus on terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be 
adjusted to the responses which have to be made at each moment. 
In the political sphere, we must continue as before. The fact 
that platforms for peace are proliferating and organizations 
whose origin lies in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] 
political area are softening their message and daring to say 
that violence leads nowhere, seems to me important. There is a 
substantial change. This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna 
toward a new strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face which 
those who have been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to 
present. So it is a good thing that they wish to present that 
image, but I have the impression that it is purely electoral 
strategy; that they are going to see whom they deceive. 
  Brunet: That is happening while attacks are 
taking place in Madrid and Barcelona. 
  Asuncion: Yes, but that is the inconsistency of 
what is a purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri 
Batasuna, with that image which they wish to present, which 
concerns them. But they have not stopped. We have had attempts 
and one casualty in Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry. 
There have been attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks, 
bombs attached to vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal 
[explosive] in Madrid, and the attack on a colonel in Barcelona. 
Hence, the activity is continuing and we must be alert. 
  Brunet: You have a certain reputation as a 
hard-liner. Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the 
idea? 
  Asuncion: It seems to me that it is completely 
inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where 
citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their 
political plans, and to conduct politically the representation 
of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals. 
So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government 
to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only 
themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance. 
  Brunet: Against the raising of principles, it can 
be said that this was attempted in Algiers. 
  Asuncion: Nobody can be accused of a lack of will 
to try everything, but it was found that that did not work out, 
and from that point there has been nothing, nor can there be 
anything. Algiers is unrepeatable. 
  Brunet: Does the reputation of being a hard-liner 
bother you or not? 
  Asuncion: Few things bother me, but I believe 
that it does not reflect reality. I am a completely normal 
individual. I do not know the reason for that hard-liner label. 
The fact is that it seems to me that there are stances on which 
you cannot compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise 
with these men of violence, and that you must make appropriate 
responses. If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe 
that that is a normal reaction. 
  Brunet: The impression has been formed that there 
were other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who 
were considering the possibility of dialogue. 
  Asuncion: Dialogue is impossible as long as they 
continue to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who 
does not wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's 
personal opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the 
government does not establish channels of dialogue with 
terrorists, and so I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these 
matters, which are government orders which are accepted. Vera 
left because he was tired -- he said so on the first day -- and 
I understand that fact. 
  Brunet: In the event of ETA [Basque Homeland and 
Liberty] relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go 
in order to promote rehabilitation? 
  Asuncion: It is laid down in the legal 
procedures. The framework created by parliament is the scope 
which we have. Those who break the code are punished. The 
grounds on which you justify your crime are the least of it. 
Every criminal justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a 
rule of conduct. 
  Brunet: There are people in the prisons who would 
perhaps like to see new prospects... 
  Asuncion: The people who are in the prisons are 
well acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They 
know very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The 
oversight judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of 
sentences, and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring 
to pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is 
possible as a reference point is the political parties' 
agreements, and the framework in which that takes place is the 
Ajuria Enea pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The 
frame of reference is what is now accepted a priori by the 
political parties. 
  Brunet: How is the dialogue with the People's 
Party viewed at the Interior Ministry? 
  Asuncion: Whenever there is a pre-election 
atmosphere, the People's Party uses these issues. I would ask 
that we keep cool heads and that the elections do not entail a 
deterioration in the political consensus on terrorism. That is 
undoubtedly what would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there 
to be discord in the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our 
duty is to prevent that from happening, with cool heads and 
setting aside matters which could disturb that consensus. After 
June, everything will return to normal, but we must prevent this 
from breaking down now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna 
area will attempt this. The steps which they are taking are to 
try to deceive the first person to approach them. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brunet: You say that there is nothing to discuss 
with ETA. What about Herri Batasuna? 
  Asuncion: Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill 
before parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say. 
This is a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what 
they want is to change the general organic prison law and the 
penal code. It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the 
lack of attention which these people in the Herri Batasuna area 
have for the ETA prisoners. [passage omitted] 
  Brunet: Recently, three Herri Batasuna members 
who were going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed 
in. Does that have anything to do with these opinions which you 
are expressing? 
  Asuncion: It seems to me stupid that those who 
are killing, as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day 
to see the sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to 
me totally inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any 
more charades of that kind. 
  Brunet: Was there an explicit request to the 
Dominican Republic? 
  Asuncion: We would say that the meeting was not 
authorized. 
  Brunet: Through diplomatic channels... 
  Asuncion: Of course. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Today Minister of Interior Antoni 
Asuncion met democratic political groups to inform them about 
anti-terrorism policy. For state security reasons, this meeting 
was held behind closed doors and what was said is secret. 
However, after the meeting, some of the data the minister put 
forward, data about ETA's infrastructure, became known. 
  The terrorist group now has 10 active commandos: five of 
them 
are of the so-called illegal type, that is people already known 
to the police; four of the legal kind, that is people without 
police records; and one support commando who is active in 
Guipuzcoa. This information was leaked by one of the deputies 
present at the meeting. 
  The Ministry of the Interior has refused to confirm or 
comment on the leak because the issue was dealt with at a secret 
meeting linked to state security. Over to our reporter (Blanca 
Zabala). 
  Zabala: Right now the terrorist organization ETA 
has a total of nine commandos of which five carry out the 
attacks. According to the police, they are located in Madrid, 
Barcelona, Guipuzcoa, Vizcaya and along the southeast coast. 
Three commandos collect information in Guipuzcoa and Navarre. 
And finally one commando providing logistical support. This one 
is located in Guipuzcoa. Furthermore, the commando in Alava is 
in the process of being reorganized. 
  This data about ETA's current strength was provided by 
Minister of the Interior Antoni Asuncion to the meeting of the 
representatives of the political parties which signed the pact 
against terrorism. Normally what is said at such meetings is 
considered secret but today the press was given this information 
by one of the parliamentarians who attended. 
  At the end of the meeting, the minister said that revulsion 
towards terrorism grows day by day. 
  [Begin Asuncion recording] There is a very marked difference 
in the civil society environment around Herri Batasuna [ETA's 
political wing], KAS [Patriotic Socialist Coordinating 
Committee], and platforms that have organized themselves as 
associations which oppose violence. [end recording] 
  Zabala: Both the minister and party 
representatives said the anti-terrorist pact has been 
strenghtened by this meeting and there is still a consensus on 
this issue. 
  Referring to the rehabilitation of ETA prisoners, Asuncion 
added there will not be a blanket solution for all the 
prisoners, each case will be treated on its merits as it has 
been done until now.

  [Text] With the approaching local elections, the 
colonialist Turkish regime has infinitely escalated its violent 
genocidal and oppressive actions. Our people cannot have the 
opportunity to express their free will in the elections in such 
an atmosphere of violence. We will not permit elections to be 
held in an atmosphere of genocide, intimidation, and special 
warfare measures put into effect by the colonialist regime. 
  Yes, dear listeners, in a statement issued on 1 March, our 
party PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] announced its policy on 
elections [words indistinct]. In a statement on behalf of our 
party, ERNK's [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] 
representative in Europe Kani Yilmaz said that we do not regard 
the elections to be held in Kurdistan as legal, and for this 
reason we are boycotting the elections. Therefore, in our view, 
DEP's [Democracy Party] decision is the one preferred by the 
Kurdish people and is also a correct decision that must be 
supported. Had there been democratic conditions, then the will 
of the people in Kurdistan would have been revealed. Our leader 
stated this fact many times over. To prevent the expression of 
the people's will, the Turkish state is using its army and its 
crime syndicate, the counterguerrilla, [words indistinct]. As 
long as the war continues in Kurdistan, we will take a clear 
stand against an election to be held outside the will of the 
Kurdish people. We will not accept these elections. Our people 
will definitely not go to these elections. I am particularly 
stressing: The candidates from the other parties must 
immediately withdraw from the elections. I am repeating: They 
must immediately withdraw from the elections. If they do not 
withdraw, as of today they are the targets of ARGK [People's 
Liberation Army of Kurdistan] and will be shot dead. The 
fascist Turkish state is detaining and (?torturing) those 
persons and candidates who do not share its ideology, and those 
engaged in election propaganda are being shot dead, the mayors 
are being removed from their posts, and party headquarters are 
being bombed. The voting boxes will be opened at military 
garrisons. These boxes are being handed over to the special 
teams and village guards. There cannot be any talk of elections 
under these conditions. This is a complete farce. 
  [Words indistinct] Our ERNK spokesman in Europe added: The 
political parties must immediately withdraw their candidates; 
otherwise, the candidates will be punished by our ARGK [words 
indistinct].

  [Text] Diyarbakir, Mar 5 (A.A) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese said on Saturday that coalition government was resolved 
to eradicate the outlawed separatist terrorist organization. 
  Mentese visited Anadolu Ajansi office in southeastern 
Diyarbakir Province. 
  During the visit he said lifting the immunity of the 
Democracy Party [DEP] deputies was a judicial thing. 
  Mentese said the government did its utmost for the region 
however that separatist terrorist organization tried to hamper 
the development activities. 
  Recalling the DEP Deputy Leyla Zana's words that lifting the 
immunities would cause more bloodshed in the region, Mentese 
said DEP and the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization were one inside the other.

  [Text] Diyarbakir/Ankara--Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of 
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) [Kurdish Workers' 
Party], has vowed to upgrade violence in Turkey's Southeast in 
mid-March and said the region "will turn into hell." 
  According to a reliable source with well-placed connections 
to the PKK Central Committee, Ocalan said this in a recent 
meeting with his commanders in charge of terrorist activities 
against Turkey. 
  Ocalan's instructions to the commanders were to upgrade 
violence in the region until the celebrations for the March 21 
Kurdish new year of Nevroz and beginning as of that day, "start 
a people's uprising." 
  His instructions, said the source, were similar to those in 
1992 and implied that the consequences of the Nevroz this year 
could be similar as well. In March 1992, Ocalan ordered a 
Kurdish uprising in Turkey and called for the establishment of 
"liberated zones." A total of 103 demonstrators were killed in 
clashes with security forces. 
  Local sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that the PKK's 
instructions related to Nevroz celebrations had not yet been 
relayed to anyone but heightened activity and public 
demonstrations were possible. 
  They note that the recent troop buildup in the region is not 
only a measure to maintain electoral security but also to insure 
peace on March 21. 
  According to one security source who asked not to be 
identified, "if the PKK decides to do anything this year, there 
will be much bloodshed. But it will be the loser." 
  The general concern among political party executives in 
Diyarbakir is that Turkey may be preparing for an all-out 
showdown with the PKK and that any terrorist activity in late 
March could trigger this "operation."

  [Text] Nine members of the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorist organization, among them a Democracy Party 
[DEP] candidate for the Adana mayorship, were captured in 
Ankara. Among the captured is also the organization's 
responsible for the provinces of Ankara, Yozgat, Kirsehir, 
Konya, Kirikkale, and Kayseri. 
  It was determined that the persons, who were captured in 
operations conducted by teams belonging to the Ankara and 
Kirsehir Security Directorates, were preparing to perpetrate 
actions in Ankara, Kirikkale, and Kirsehir. Ensuing the 
suspects' interrogation, it was determined that they 
participated in the following acts: burning the forest opposite 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly lodges in Ankara and 
throwing bombs at the Nationalist Action Party provincial 
headquarters in Ankara and True Path Party District headquarters 
in Cankaya. It was also reported that the suspects perpetrated 
actions such as throwing bombs, attacking, and extorting money 
on behalf of the organization in Kirsehir, Diyarbakir, and 
Bingol. 
  In searches conducted of the safe houses and work places 
indicated by the suspects, two long-range automatic rifles, six 
magazines for these automatic weapons, 156 flares, three 
revolvers of various calibers and four magazines belonging to 
them, material used in the manufacture of bombs, and 
organizational documents were seized. 
  According to a statement issued by the Ankara Security 
Directorate, the head DEP official for Ankara Province is being 
sought. 
  Meanwhile the captured answered reporters' questions and 
stated that they were penitent, calling on everybody to resist 
violence. The suspects further explained that the terrorist 
organization is planning on transferring its violent 
perpetrations to metropolitan areas and for that reason they 
were also transferring their cadres to big cities.

<F P=106> [Article by Rupert Steiner] </F>
  [Text] Four airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, failed to 
detect Semtex bombs being smuggled by government security 
investigators on board their aircraft at Heathrow. 
  Staff checking baggage and monitoring x-ray machines missed 
the devices, some of which were hidden inside Mr Blobby dolls 
and built out of Semtex, detonators and electric wires. The 
tests last month were part of a campaign to improve security at 
the busiest international airport. 
  American, United and KLM Royal Dutch also failed the test, 
conducted by Transec (transport security) officials working for 
the Department of Transport, after a complaint about security 
loopholes from a former security employee at the airport. 
  The devices were recovered by Transec inspectors minutes 
before they were due to be loaded into holds. 
  A block of Semtex the size of a bag of sugar blew up a Pan 
Am 
Boeing 747 over Lockerbie in Scotland five years ago, killing 
270 people, many of whom had boarded at Heathrow. Security 
experts said yesterday that the dummy devices posed no threat to 
passengers because the Semtex was chemically inert. 
  Harry Ditmas, the Transec director, recently reported to 
ministers that travellers using Britain's airports were still 
facing an "unacceptable" risk from terrorism. He said he 
regarded security standards as getting better but still 
depressingly poor. 
  Last year, Transec inspectors identified at least one 
significant security lapse a month, any one of which could have 
allowed terrorists to slip through the "ring of steel" promised 
by successive transport ministers. 
  Standards vary, from Glasgow, where all baggage is screened, 
to Norwich, where Transec has issued a warning to managers to 
strengthen security. Last year even El Al, the Israeli airline 
widely regarded as the most security-conscious airline in the 
world, was criticised by Transec. "Overall, the implementation 
of security measures is still patchy," said Ditmas, a defence 
ministry official seconded to Transec after the Lockerbie 
tragedy. 
  United Airlines, one of the world's biggest, has dismissed 
an 
employee after the Heathrow tests. "We have tightened up 
procedures," the airline said. "But we do not feel the test was 
fair. Transec does not allow for `profiling' -- identifying 
terrorists by passport-checks and other methods -- and anyway 
the device would have been picked out before being loaded on to 
a plane because we reconcile all bags with passengers. British 
airlines do not have to do that until 1996." Virgin Atlantic 
said it was investigating "an incident" and would review safety 
procedures. KLM confirmed it had failed the test on January 20, 
but said it would have stopped a bomb getting on to an aircraft 
by baggage reconciliation. 
  Other airlines tested during the week-long Transec campaign 
are believed to have detected the bombs, but officials declined 
to identify them.

Gasworks Bombers Jailed for Total of 60 Years"] 
  [Text] Two IRA terrorists who bombed Warrington gasworks 
were jailed for 35 and 25 years at the Old Bailey yesterday. 
  Pairic MacFhloinn, 40, who came from Dublin for the 
operation, and Nottingham-based IRA "sleeper" Denis Kinsella, 
25, were convicted of causing an explosion with intent to 
endanger life. 
  They were also found guilty of attempting to murder a 
policeman who stopped them, of kidnapping a motorist at gunpoint 
and of possessing a firearm. 
  MacFhloinn's sentence is amongst the longest handed out to 
IRA terrorists by a British court. 
  The pair were convicted after a six-week trial arising from 
the night of February 25 last year. With another terrorist, who 
was never caught, they planted bombs and incendiary devices at 
the gasworks, which ignited gas from one tank and set off a 
spectacular fireball, causing &pound;1 million worth of damage, 
but 
failed to explode the total of 11 million cubic feet. 
  Kinsella's uncle, John Kinsella, 49, who was born in Dublin 
but had lived in Nottingham for 34 years, was convicted of 
hiding Semtex in an allotment, though he did not go to 
Warrington. He was jailed for 20 years for possessing Semtex. 
  Mr Justice McCullouch told MacFhloinn: "I have no doubt, as 
far as you are concerned, the bigger the explosion, the better." 
  The judge told Denis Kinsella he accepted he would not have 
participated "unless you had been persuaded to do so by another 
member of your family, perhaps two members, whose requests you 
would have found it difficult to refuse." 
  The jury heard that Kinsella's father, also called Denis, 
introduced him to MacFhloinn. But the judge said: "You were not 
as helpless and dim as the picture you sought to give to the 
jury. You had sufficient strength of character to say no." 
  MacFhloinn and the escaped terrorist, known only as Michael 
Timmins from Ireland, made up the Semtex bombs in a room in 
Denis Kinsella's home in Manvers Street, Nottingham. Kinsella 
drove them in a battered old Mazda van on the 87-mile journey to 
the works on the A49, one mile from Warrington town centre. 
  After planting the devices, they drove off through 
Warrington 
but were stopped by a diligent patrol officer, Pc Mark Toker, 
25, who thought they might be drunk. 
  Kinsella tried for 25 minutes to talk his way out of the 
questioning by Pc Toker. The officer ran a police computer check 
on the van and a breath test on Kinsella, both proved negative. 
  But he want he wanted to search Kinsella and his two 
colleagues. They could not risk his discovering their gun and so 
MacFhloinn fired five bullets at him, at close range from the 
back of the van. 
  Pc Toker was hit in the stomach, thigh and buttock and was 
left bleeding in the road as the trio escaped. But he had the 
presence of mind to relay descriptions of the trio and van on 
his radio. 
  The bombers abandoned their van in the Cheshire village of 
Lymm and forced 19-year-old Lee Wright to stop his Ford Escort, 
Kinsella putting him in the boot. 
  The motorist then endured a 25-minute journey as the trio 
drove to the Trafford Park area of Manchester. 
  There, a policeman thought they might be "ramraiders" and 
gave chase. They out-manoeuvred him and the pursuit was taken up 
by Pc Andrew Mackay in his Ford Cosworth. 
  He saw the front passenger, Timmins, lean out to throw a 
brick or video recorder at his car, a common tactic of 
ramraiders. 
  But as he swerved, Timmins fired the handgun at him, hitting 
the engine and stopping his car. The chase was then continued by 
an officer in a dog van. 
  Mr Wright, who was still in the boot, was alert enough to 
try 
to stop the Escort once he heard the sirens and shots. He 
disconnected a wire in the boot, wrongly believing it might 
control the petrol tank. 
  But it did control the petrol gauge and the terrorists 
abandoned their car because they thought it had run out of fuel. 
  All three made off across fields. MacFhloinn was brought 
down 
by a dog, Kinsella was found cowering in a ditch but Timmins 
escaped.

Drogheda: "Revenge Gang Kills `Mad Dog' Terrorist"] 
  [Text] Dominic McGlinchey, the former republican terrorist 
leader who carried out some of Ulster's most brutal killings, 
has been murdered. Irish police believe his killers were former 
associates settling a long-standing feud. 
  McGlinchey, who as head of the Irish National Liberation 
Army 
was nicknamed Mad Dog, was shot ten times at point-blank range 
by three men as he used a telephone box next to a hospital. The 
killing happened on Thursday night at Drogheda, Co Louth. 
McGlinchey had been driving home with his 18-year-old son, also 
called Dominic, who watched from the car as the gunmen shot his 
father in the knees, stomach, chest, neck and head. 
  Detectives said yesterday that McGlinchey, who was believed 
to be setting up a new republican paramilitary organisation, was 
shot by former members of the INLA who had been stalking his 
movements in Drogheda. Intelligence sources said McGlinchey's 
killers were believed to have been tortured by him when he tried 
to root out INLA informers ten years ago. 
  McGlinchey knew he was living under the threat of an attack 
and escaped a murder attempt last June. The new attack came 
three months after his release from the republic's Portlaoise 
prison after a ten-year sentence. 
  A police source said yesterday: "This time they were making 
no mistake. It was a real professional killing. The men who 
killed him were settling an old score." The same group is 
believed to have been responsible for the murder of McGlinchey's 
wife, Mary, who was shot at pointblank range in front of her two 
sons in 1987. 
  McGlinchey, who was devastated by her murder, vowed to root 
out the killers. But it appears that they reached him first. A 
detective said yesterday: "He lived by the gun and died by the 
gun. He was not a man who was going to die in his bed of old 
age." 
  Local people described the scene behind the Our Lady of 
Lourdes Hospital. Kevin O'Rourke said: "I heard a couple of 
bangs and someone screaming. I went out and could see this man 
lying on the ground with a hole in his chest and head. Blood was 
everywhere." 
  Margaret Black, 47, who lives near by, said: "I knelt down 
beside him and felt a weak pulse in his neck. I knew he was on 
the way out. He then said to me, 'Jesus, help me, Mary.'" This 
was apparently a reference to his wife. 
  After forensic scientists from dublin examined the area, 
McGlinchey's body was moved to the hospital mortuary early 
yesterday for a post-mortem examination. McGlinchey will be 
buried next week next to his wife in Bellaghy, Co Londonderry.

<F P=106> [By Teilo Colley and Keith Manning, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] Terrorists tonight launched five mortars in an 
attack on Heathrow Airport -- but they all apparently failed to 
go off. The devices were in a Datsun car in a hotel car park 
close to the airport in West Drayton, West London, and there 
were no reports of any injuries, Scotland Yard said. 
  News of the attack was announced by Home Secretary Michael 
Howard in the Commons as MPs were discussing renewing the 
contentious Prevention of Terrorism Act. He later said the IRA 
had to be the prime suspect for the attack. 
  Eyewitnesses spoke of bangs and blazing cars in the car park 
of the Excelsior Hotel which is on the perimeter of the airport. 
  Anti-terrorist officers were on the scene and an intensive 
search of the airport was under way. Heathrow confirmed that 
the northern runway, which is the closest to the the hotel, was 
operating at the time of the attack. It was only closed 
afterwards. 
  "It is used by landing aircraft, but there can be quite a 
gap 
between landings at this time of night. It's very unlikely that 
aircraft would have been landing at the time," said an airport 
spokeswoman. 
  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "Police are investigating 
what appears to be a mortar attack at Heathrow airport. It is 
believed that the mortar attack was fired at approximately 1757 
from a Datsun motor vehicle in a car park at the Excelsior Hotel 
on the perimeter of the airport near the junction with Sipson 
Road and Bath Road. It appears five mortars were fired. There 
are no reports of detonations. It's believed the mortars were 
targeted towards the airport. There are no reports of injuries. 
Anti-terrorist branch officers are in attendance and an 
extensive search of the airport is currently being conducted for 
the unexploded mortars." 
  In an apparent misleading warning, Sky News received a 
telephone call from a man with an Irish accent saying that there 
would be explosions inside the airport about 50 minutes before 
the mortar attack was fired from outside the perimeter fence. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr Howard told Channel 4 News: "If it was meant to send a 
signal to the House of Commons, I think it is a pity that the 
House of Commons was unable to give a united response because 
the Labour Party did not come into the lobby with us to support 
the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. But the 
majority in favour of the renewal of those powers was a big 
majority. So if this was a signal from the terrorists, they got 
their answer from the House of Commons." 
  Mr Howard did not accuse the IRA of the mortar attack, but 
indicated it had to be the prime suspect given the timing 
coinciding with the terrorism debate in Parliament. [passage 
omitted] 
  Tonight's attack is the first major terrorist incident on 
the 
British mainland since the Anglo-Irish declaration on peace in 
Northern Ireland was signed in December.

<F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondents John Deane and Keith </F>
Manning] 
  [Text] A number of incendiaries were fired at London's 
Heathrow airport tonight -- the second major security incident 
there in less than 36 hours. An airport spokeswoman confirmed 
incendiaries were fired in the vicinity of terminal four, but it 
appeared none had detonated. Damage appeared to be minimal. 
Heathrow press officer Anita Newcourt said: "It looks like the 
same as last night. Some incendiaries have been fired. There 
has been very little damage." 
  London Ambulance Service said there were no reports of any 
injuries. A spokesman said the service was alerted at 12.11am 
when it was told of "an act of aggression" at Heathrow. 
  Five ambulances, two paramedic units and a command unit have 
been sent to the airport. Four fire engines are also standing 
by. The ambulance spokesman said they had also received reports 
of two suspicious packages. 
  The incident was centred on terminal four, which was 
evacuated as a full-scale alert went into operation. The 
southern runway has been closed down, but the northern runway 
remains open. 
  Security services were alerted shortly after midnight when 
there were reports of a "bang or thud" close to the terminal, 
although not on any runway, said a spokesman. 
  Anti-terrorist squad officers were combing the airport after 
a "metal object" landed close to terminal four. There were no 
casualties or any damage to any buildings, he added. 
  A spokeswoman for the Hilton Hotel at Heathrow said police 
telephoned the hotel shortly after midnight asking staff to 
check the roof for anything suspicious. Nothing was found, she 
added. 
  The Yard spokesman said at this stage there was no 
indication 
there were any warnings. The latest alert comes after the IRA 
fired four mortars packed with high explosives at the airport on 
Wednesday evening from the back of a stolen car left in a nearby 
hotel. They did not detonate. 
  Scotland Yard said three mortars were recovered at the 
south-east end of the airport, close to terminal four. 
  A number of non-specific warnings were telephoned to various 
news organisations from 5.25pm yesterday, Scotland Yard said.

  [Text] The southern runway reopened at 7.30 am, the 
airport said. Terminal Four and roads around the airport were 
reopened during the night. 
  Some early morning flights were cancelled and others 
diverted 
before the terminal was opened. People inquiring about British 
Airways arrivals were advised to ring 081 759 2525. 
  A statement from the airport said: "Due to the closure of 
one 
runway, delays are likely on other inbound and outbound flights." 
  "Passengers can be assured that this morning's incident is 
being contained within Terminal Four and that their safety 
remains a top priority." 
  It said the airport usually used only one runway during the 
night. The southern runway was being used from 10.30pm last 
night. 
  The last plane to take off was at 11.25pm -- 35 minutes 
before the incident. 
  The last plane to land was a mail flight which touched down 
on the northern runway at 00.34am. 
  The latest incident follows a warning by Sinn Fein president 
Gerry Adams yesterday that there could be another attack like 
Wednesday's IRA strike on the airport, when four mortar bombs 
were fired from a vehicles in a car park at the Excelsior Hotel, 
on the Heathrow's northern border.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Writing in the 17 February Athens weekly 
OIKONOMIKOS TAKHIDROMOS, Yiannis Marinos quotes his own 11 
November 93 article, in which he had drawn the attention of the 
then newly installed Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) 
government on what he termed the "erroneous" abolition of the 
law forbidding press publication of terrorist statements 
claiming responsibility for political assassinations. While no 
true democrat should support laws limiting a free press and the 
free movement of ideas, the law instituted under the previous 
New Democracy (ND) government essentially aimed at preventing 
terrorists from using assassination to propagate ideas that 
would otherwise not see the light of day, Marinos contended at 
the time. An indication--if not proof--that terrorists used 
newspapers to promote their views was the fact that for more 
than a year, when the law was in existence, no attacks had taken 
place, Marinos had written then. 
  Returning to the present, Marinos notes that "unfortunately, 
his minority opinion" was ignored, the law was abolished, and 
terrorist 17 November resumed the course of assassinations "with 
renewed enthusiasm," murdering Mikhalis Vranopoulos, former 
director of the National Bank of Greece. 17 November can now 
rely on the "hospitable" columns of various newspapers to 
convince people that the entire Greek political class, which 
they elect through democratic processes, is made up of "bums, 
thieves, and fraudulent and corrupt officials" whom only 
terrorists can punish in the name of the people's interest, 
Marinos writes. Referring to the 17 November proclamation on the 
Vranopoulos assassination, he notes that in an attempt to "fill 
the gap" created by the non-publication of previous claims while 
the anti-terrorist law was in effect, the terrorists have now 
warned hundreds of income tax agents and Ministry of National 
Economy officials that they will henceforth be attacked without 
warning. While Minister of Justice Kouvelakis can now rest 
assured that no individual rights of terrorist suspects will be 
violated, Marinos wryly notes, he should also be aware that he 
is facilitating "involuntarily" the violation of potential 
victims' human rights. While the government spokesman asserted 
that terrorism cannot be prosecuted through harsh legislation, 
he must know that the most fearsome European terrorist 
organizations were quickly and essentially dismantled when 
special anti-terrorist legislation was adopted in Italy, France 
and Germany, Marinos states. He then proceeds to quote the 
"incredible" statement made by Court of Appeals prosecutor 
Khristoforos Tzannakakis, according to whom "there must be a 
reason for the 17 November assassinations...A man is not 
executed unless there is a crime." "If Tzannakakis speaks the 
same language as other Greeks and is aware of what he is 
saying," Marinos comments, then: 
  1. 17 November victims are criminals, for otherwise they 
would not be executed. 
  2. Tzannakakis uses the term "execute" in the same sense as 
the terrorists, who imply that the death penalty is meted out to 
criminals, thus arrogating to themselves the role of the justice 
system. 
  3. Logically, Vranopoulos and other victims of l7 November 
were criminals who provoked the "punitive intervention" of the 
terrorist organization. 
  Finally, Marinos cites Tzannakakis as answering a reporter's 
question by saying he does not feel threatened by terrorism 
because "he has never aroused personal hatreds," and "has done 
nothing in his professional life to cause anyone's anger, 
especially that of 17 November." This naturally leads the 
terrorist organization to conclude that according to the 
prosecutor himself, he should not be "executed," but others who 
have committed "crimes" should, Marinos bitterly concludes.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait City, March 5 (AFP)--A key defendant in 
the trial of 11 Iraqis and three Kuwaitis accused of trying to 
assassinate former US President George Bush retracted his 
confession on Saturday [5 March], pleading not guilty as the 
trial resumed at Kuwait's state security court. 
  Wali 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Ghazali, a 36-year-old Iraqi, denied 
working for the Iraqi intelligence service, reversing his stand 
when the trial opened on June 5. 
  At the request of lawyers for the two main 
defendants--al-Ghazali and another Iraqi, Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir 
al-'Assadi--the court adjourned the trial until April 2. 
  "I did myself wrong by my confessions," said al-Ghazali, 
denying that the Iraqi intelligence service employed him to 
assassinate Bush in a suicide mission in Kuwait in April 1993, 
using a car bomb or explosives strapped to his body. 
  Earlier al-Ghazali and al-'Assadi, 33, regarded as the 
ringleader of the group, said the Iraqi authorities had "forced" 
them to carry out the mission. 
  Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives 
into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot 
to assassinate Bush. 
  Iraqi Ahmad Jabbar Habib, 21, repeated his denial Saturday. 
  The other defendants also denied any involvement in the plot 
or links with Iraq. [passage omitted on Gulf War]

<F P=106> [By "JORDAN TIMES staff reporter" P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] The devastated father of a Jordanian convicted in 
the New York World Trade Centre bombing is agonising over why 
his son's lawyer did a volte-face in his summation, which he 
believes led to the conviction of not only his son but also 
another three defendants. 
  Amin Salamah, father of Mohammad Salamah (26), who, along 
with three others, was found guilty by a jury in a New York 
court Friday, is also bitter that no Jordanian organisation or 
individual stepped forward to help him or advise him. 
  He said he had obtained a three-month-valid U.S. visa in 
September, but did not have enough money to buy a ticket to New 
York to visit his son and see whether there was anything he 
could do to help establish his innocence. 
  Mr. Salamah, a retired army lieutenant who hails from Bedia 
village in the West Bank, works for Amman Customs Clearning 
Agency to provide for his family of 11 children younger to 
Mohammad and their mother with his Army pension and a JD 120 
monthly salary. 
  "I did not leave a single known door unknocked," he told the 
JORDAN TIMES. "But there was nobody who was willing to help, 
including those who call themselves human rights activists and 
experts in law." 
  "They had no interest in the case, and many appeared anxious 
not to have anything to do with it," he said. 
  My question to them is: "Isn't every accused entitled to a 
fair trial? And if so, was my son given a fair trial? Did any 
Jordanian lawyer take the slightest interest to find out whether 
the trial followed the due process of the law?" 
  Mr. Salamah, 51, who fled his village along with his family 
in the 1967 war, believes that neither his son nor any of the 
other three is guilty, and that Israeli agents seeking to 
distort the image of Arabs and Muslims had a hand in the affair 
and entrapped the accused in the case. 
  "My instinct and conscience tells me there is much more to 
the entire affair than we have been told," he said, adding that 
the summation of his son's lawyer, Richard Precht, was the most 
damaging element that led to the guilty verdict. 
  "Throughout the trial, the lawyer was very good and made a 
very good case of Mohammad's defence. But, for some unknown 
reasons, he took a complete turn in the last minute," said Mr. 
Salameh, who lives in Zarqa. 
  "Perhaps he was coerced, pressured or forced into doing 
that," he said. "But it does not change the fact that my son 
and three others now face life in prison." 
  He was referring to Mr. Precht's closing argument that 
Mohammad Salamah was an unwitting victim of another defendant 
who trapped him into taking part in the Feb. 26 explosion at the 
twin-towers. The blast killed six people and injured more than 
1,000. 
  Describing Ramzi Yusuf, an accused who remains at large, as 
an "evil genuis," Mr. Precht asserted that Mohammad Salamah was 
duped by Mr. Yusuf. "Mohammad Salamah was terribly misled, 
terribly manipulated... by a person who came into this country 
with a single mission, to destroy American targets," Mr. Precht 
told the court on Feb. 17. 
  Mr. Precht was the only defence lawer who presented such an 
argument which implied that there was a bomb plot and Mr. 
Salamah was part of it. All others maintained the total 
innocence of their clinets and at least one of them accused Mr. 
Precht of undermining his client's defence. 
  Mr. Salamah said his son contacted him over the phone on 
Thursday, less than 24 hours before the verdict was announced. 
  "He sounded very confident that all would be acquitted," Mr. 
Salamah said. "He told me he would be with us here in a few 
days." 
  "Even the lawyer, who had called me a few days earlier, told 
me the same thing. He said the charges were unfounded and 
unsubstantiated," said Mr. Salamah. 
  The ex-serviceman noted that Mohammad had filed a petition 
to 
the judge that Mr. Precht's incriminatory summation did not 
represent his views and that the lawyer was no longer his legal 
counsel. 
  "But the court decided to accept the lawyer's argument that 
there was no change in his status as Mohammad's counsel," Mr. 
Salamah said. 
  "I don't know why (Precht) did such an injustice to my son, 
who always maintained his innocence and never told the lawyer 
anything of the nature that was presented to the court," said 
Amin Salamah. 
  "My limited knowledge of things tells me a lawyer is not 
supposed to invent things and present them in court on behalf of 
his client," he said. "Where did he get the notion that 
Mohammad had any part, witting or otherwise, in the attack?" 
  Mr. Salamah said his son, who has been in touch with the 
family over the phone from his prison, "always swore by God and 
assured me that he had nothing to do with the bombing and that 
he was never involved in any subversive plots." 
  "I brought up and educated my son, and I believe him."

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The alleged German top terrorist 
Johannes Weinrich obviously was planning to assassinate former 
U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This has been reported by the 
Hamburg STERN magazine [to be published on 10 March]. The 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] found a document 
among Stasi files in which Weinrich noted that the "President of 
the United States of America" was a targeted person and where he 
described the weapons he needed: "Two Beretta submachine guns 
and handguns with silencers." 
  Weinrich is regarded as the brain behind the attack on the 
"Maison de France," the French cultural center in Berlin. In 
the 25 August 1983 attack, one man was killed and 23 persons 
injured. It has been learned from legal circles in Berlin that 
the state prosecutor also has information that might point to a 
possible assassination plan. However, in this connection no 
preliminary investigations have been initiated yet against 
Weinrich, who is regarded as close confidant of top terrorist 
"Carlos." 
  The investigating state prosecutor in the "Maison de France" 
case has meanwhile confirmed that an international arrest 
warrant has been issued against Weinrich for aiding and abetting 
murder. In addition, another arrest warrant was issued in 
connection with Weinrich's role in the attack against the Saudi 
Arabian ambassador in Athens in 1983. The ambassador survived 
the attack only by coincidence. 
  The state prosecutor has further announced that he would 
soon 
request a third arrest warrant against Weinrich, namely in 
connection with the attack against "Radio Free Europe" in Munich 
in 1981, when many people were severely injured. According to 
the information of German security authorities, Weinrich is in 
Syria at the moment. The FRG has requested that the Arab 
country extradite Weinrich.

<F P=106> [News conference by Diego Valades Rios, Mexican attorney </F>
general of the Federal District, with unidentified reporters at 
the Attorney General's Offices in Tijuana on 24 March; from 
"ACIR Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Valades: The Federal District Attorney 
General's Office announces that according to the investigation 
conducted so far, the multiple testimonies provided by 
eyewitnesses, and the evidence obtained, it has been confirmed 
that Mario Aburto Martinez was the person who killed Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta yesterday. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez fired two shots, one directly at the 
head and the other at the abdomen. The first shot was fatal. 
Both bullets exited the body. The shots were fired with a 
special Brazilian-made, .38-caliber Taurus revolver. According 
to the expert's report, the weapon contained two unspent bullets 
and two spent caps. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez was arrested at the scene of the 
incident and brought to Attorney General's Office [PGR] 
installations in Tijuana to make his first statements. He 
admitted being the perpetrator of this crime, which has shaken 
the Mexican republic. His statements were made before the 
Federal District Attorney General's Office in the presence of 
Lawyer Xavier Carbajal, president of the Emilio Orra Baja Bar 
Association of Tijuana, and before Jose Luis Perez Canchola, 
human rights ombudsman of Baja California State, in compliance 
with the provisions of the republic's Federal Constitution, 
thereby preserving the rights of the person responsible for this 
heinous crime. 
  Aburto Martinez' health condition was also certified upon 
entering the judicial installations because he had already been 
beaten by people near him after he carried out the attack. This 
may be confirmed by the various media that witnessed the 
incident. The attack was carried out following a political 
event at the Lomas Taurinas Neighborhood in this border city. 
  Also turned over to the Attorney General's Office were 
Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega, who 
may be released with legal conditions unless new elements arise 
that change their legal status. 
  The assassin will be remanded in the next few hours and 
taken 
to a maximum-security location. I came to this city on the 
express orders of President Carlos Salinas and I have directly 
coordinated the investigation. I was accompanied by Rene 
Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera Morales, assistant 
prosecutors for preliminary investigations, and by other 
officials and experts dedicated to the investigation and the 
complete clarification of this regrettable crime. 
  Also working on the investigations was (Mario Fabio 
Beltrones), governor of Sonora State, where Colosio was born. 
  The incidents occurred as follows: At the conclusion of the 
public rally that was part of his election campaign, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], at 1710 stepped off the stage that 
had been constructed for the event in Lomas Taurinas and mingled 
with the people in attendance. He subsequently headed for his 
vehicle. After Colosio walked approximately 10 meters, Mario 
Aburto Martinez emerged from the crowd on Colosio's right-hand 
side. Martinez drew a revolver, placed it a few centimeters 
from Colosio's right temple, and pulled the trigger, causing the 
injury that took his life. After the bullet entered the right 
temple and exited through the left side, the victim spun around 
counterclockwise. As he was falling, the attacker fired his 
weapon again to produce a second wound in the abdominal region. 
The bullet entered [words indistinct] and left a wound on its 
way out near the right hypochondrium. 
  This account of the events was duly and completely confirmed 
by eyewitness testimonies, by the results of the autopsy and a 
forensic histology, and by a ballistic study that established 
the position of the victim and the attacker and the trajectory 
of the projectiles. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez was subdued by people who were around 
the victim, immediately arrested, and placed at the disposal of 
the Federal District Attorney General's Office. Based on this, 
it can undoubtedly be concluded that the two shots were fired by 
one person from one weapon whose cylinder contained two spent 
and two unspent cartridges. The former were next to each other. 
  Aburto Martinez underwent the sodium [word indistinct] test 
to determine whether he had fired a firearm. This test proved 
positive. In his initial statement, Aburto Martinez confessed 
to firing the two shots at Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. He 
did so, as we said, in the circumstances already described in 
the presence of two people who represented him, local lawyers, 
and the president of the Human Rights Commission. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23- year-old perpetrator, is from 
Zamora, Michoacan. He has a primary school education and is an 
industrial mechanic. He said he has lived in Tijuana since he 
was 15 and has dedicated himself to working since that time. He 
confirmed that he was employed by Cameros Magneticos in Mesa de 
Otai and was domiciled in this city of Baja California. As for 
the weapon he used, he admitted acquiring it several weeks ago 
with the intention of using it for the incidents under 
investigation. He was arrested in the act and confessed to the 
crime with all the evidence against him. He will be remanded to 
the competent judicial authorities within the legally 
established time. 
  The case is not fully closed. There are still questions 
which, according to the law, must be taken to their final 
answers. [passage omitted on coordination in justice process]

Amaru People's Army; Constantino Quispe Caceres, 56, aka 
Espartaco or Felix; Adan Torres Vasquez, 32, aka Angel, Federico 
Manuel Vargas Yupanqui, aka Jorge; Mariela Gabriela Guarino, 35, 
aka Gaby, an Italian journalist in charge of disseminating MRTA 
propaganda abroad through video films; and Miriam Torres. The 
police discovered two clandestine bases from where the terrorist 
actions were planned. They dismantled a sophisticated short and 
long range communications base. (Lima Global de Television
