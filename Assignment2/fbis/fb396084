<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Aleksandr Yegorov, </F>
under the rubric: "A View on the Problem": "Science Requires 
Money: An Axiom That Still Has To Be Argued in Russia"] 
  [Text] In the middle of November 1993, Russian 
Federation President B. Yeltsin conducted a conference on 
conversion issues in Tula where he announced his intention to 
increase the share of expenditures on NIOKR [scientific research 
and experimental design work] of defense NIIs [scientific 
research institutes] and KBs [design bureaus] by 10 percent in 
the 1994 military budget. At a 19 January 1994 Security Council 
session, he reaffirmed what he had said in Tula, emphasizing, in 
the process, the aspiration to bring NIOKR's share up to 15 
percent in the future. What caused these figures and what do 
they mean for science, the country's economy and its defense 
capability? 
  To explain this, let's recall that NIOKR -- scientific 
research and experimental design work -- is nothing other than 
the evolution of a scientist's or engineer-designer's idea that 
is designated by this abbreviation. Its diagram is well known: 
Fundamental science theoretically announces discoveries, 
research and inventions, the materialization of which in 
principle can be utilized directly in the development of 
weapons. This discovery needs confirmation. NIR --scientific 
research work -- or NIER -- scientific research and experimental 
work -- is designed for confirmation. With its favorable result, 
the process shifts to the next stage -- experimental design work 
(OKR), during the course of which a concrete model with assigned 
parameters is developed. Later, testing and, finally, series 
production follow. 
  Although this is also a simplified understanding of NIOKR, 
its essence is contained precisely in this. And also in the fact 
that its own category of work that needs financing corresponds 
to each stage of NIOKR. Basic and exploratory research, and also 
the development and improvement of experimental, technological 
and test range facilities occupy a special place among them 
because they are the foundation of foundations. Because 
exploration, progress, the development of an elementary base, 
and the prediction of development of some or other direction of 
research depends on their state. That is, the future depends on 
them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It is not unlike an axiom. It is known and followed 
throughout the world. By way of illustration, during the last 35 
years, the United States has been steadily allocating from 
35-45% of the resources allocated for all military 
R&amp;D for 
"basic research" and facilities. And even right now, when 
military expenditures are being substantially reduced and the 
American organs of state rule are accomplishing the task of 
changing the strategy of development of the national defense 
technological and industrial base, the overall principle of 
allocating resources remains unchanged. A preference is being 
assigned to the future -- to the development of defense 
technologies and next generation equipment. 
  In Russia, reduction of defense appropriations began in 
1988. 
Is it not paradoxical, with a reduction of budget expenditures 
for science? And first of all, for basic and exploratory 
research and for development of facilities. These expenditures 
were reduced by a factor of 2.5 in 1992 alone. The degradation 
of the research process that supports the development of the 
scientific-technical reserve makes an even bigger impression in 
a percentage ratio, from 10% in 1989 to 0.5% in 
1993. 
  This situation will result in entirely predictable 
consequences: In the near future, we will not be able to develop 
future weapons systems. We will not be able to, unless the state 
-- and today Russian science has no other customer or other 
source of financing, besides the state budget -- sends the 
required amount of resources for the conduct of basic and 
exploratory scientific research work, the development of high 
technologies and dual-use technologies, and the development of 
the scientific-technical reserve. 
  The question arises: What figure is being designated as the 
"required amount of resources"? We have already explained that 
the Americans spend up to 45% of R&amp;D money. Experts, 
specifically, Goskomoboronprom [State Committee for the Defense 
Industry] Main Administration for Scientific-Technical and 
Conversion Programs Deputy Chief Vladislav Fadeyev, assert that 
our expenditures should not be lower than 30%. All the 
more so 
right now when the budget has not been executed for three years 
(1991-1993) and we have significantly lagged behind. We have 
begun to lag behind ourselves. 
  It remains to determine the starting point: How much does 
all 
NIOKR cost? One thing is required to do this -- to observe the 
proper rules. The main rule consists of the fact that the 
development cycle for one model of military equipment or weapon 
totals 10-15 years, from the idea to series production. This 
standard has been acceptable for everyone, not only for Russia. 
So, in order to fit into the time periods, it is necessary to 
invest no less than 14-15% of the project's cost annually 
into 
the development. World experience confirms this. Only in this 
manner is it possible to approach 80% readiness of the 
model in 
5-6 years and to become convinced that it will be developed. 
  The Americans finance their R&amp;D while proceeding 
precisely 
from these proportions. In their country, science accounts on 
average for 15% of the ratio of military expenditures. It 
was 
approximately the same in our country, until 1988. Later the 
reduction occurred. And in 1993, this figure fell below the 
3% 
mark. (Now, imagine what kind of small change basic science and 
facilities raked in if their share totaled less than 1% 
of that 
3%). 
  As Vladislav Fadeyev says, "In general we can also work in 
that 3%. Only then developments will be prolonged to 25-30 
years. But that is absurd." In other words, it is a utopian task 
to develop future weapons and also dual purpose future 
technologies. The requirements of the military doctrine and the 
weapons program that have been calculated until the year 2000, 
the realization of which has been approved, will not withstand 
any criticism in this case. 
  Based upon the assessments of Western specialists and 
experts, specifically, from the Pentagon, the former USSR, being 
a mighty power in a military sense, lagged behind the United 
States in 17 of 31 primary types of weapons based upon their 
technical level. In the future, the technical lag in this sphere 
can reach a critical point, after which Russia will be compelled 
to purchase high-tech weapons abroad in order to have a 
well-equipped army. 
  Based upon the assessments of our own scientists, we are at 
the level of the United States in only 6-7 of 21 key 
technologies. Unfortunately, this gap has also been increasing 
in recent years. 
  Today, expenditures on R&amp;D are increasing in all 
countries 
and especially intensively for the Germans, Japanese, and 
Chinese. All of them are taking advantage of the opportunity and 
are attempting to leave Russia behind. In the United States, 
expenditures have increased from $13.1 billion in 1980 to $37.8 
billion in 1992. Today, the United States government annually 
spends $76 billion on all science, of that 60% is for 
purely 
military programs. In the process, President Clinton says that 
from now on he will view support of multi-profile industrial 
technologies as a priority task. "Financing must be reviewed so 
that more resources are allocated for critically important 
technologies such as future materials, information technology, 
and new production processes that will permit us to improve 
industrial parameters". 
  That is why it was necessary to resolve the problem of 
financing science to ensure we eliminate our lagging behind 
which is already a fact. And although a 10% infusion is 
only 
capable of temporarily easing the situation (and this is still 
unknown because the 1994 budget has not yet been approved and 
they only recently began to repay the state's debts for defense 
order-93, meaning that we have already picked the pocket of our 
own pants which have still not been sewn), that very fact is 
important. All the more so that it gives us hope that all is not 
yet lost.

<F P=106> [Article by Yefim Lyuboshits under rubric "Opinions": </F>
"Government Bureaucrats Hinder Improvement in Efficiency of 
Defense Expenditures"] 
  [Text] My article entitled "How To Remove the Fat from the 
Defense Budget" was published in SEGODNYA of 16 October 1993. 
  The impetus to write it was a statement by Ye. T. Gaydar 
published earlier here that it was possible to save our economy 
from disintegration only by reducing budget expenditures, in 
which fat makes up a fourth of them as a minimum. And I wrote 
that there is much fat in the defense budget, with the principal 
reasons for its formation being the imperfect practice of 
developing the defense budget, the absence of open 
substantiation of expenditures by budget items, and the absence 
of independent expert examination of the defense budget. 
  All this is the result of a tradition of many years of 
striving for USSR military superiority at any cost without 
regard for expenditures. 
  Those shortcomings can be eliminated by developing and 
implementing a rational system for forming the defense budget. 
  My statement was supported by Professor V. I. Tsymbal, who 
published the article "Just What Is Happening With the Defense 
Budget?" on 18 November 1993. 
  The need for developing a system for forming the defense 
budget also is supported by the content of an article by Yu. A. 
Ivanov published in SEGODNYA on 19 January 1994. No practical 
actions to improve development of the defense budget followed 
after the above articles were published. 
  Realizing that Gaydar and his immediate assistants might not 
have noticed my article in the fever of the election campaign, I 
sent a personal letter to Yegor Timurovich through the reception 
administration of the Russian Federation president and 
government (Incoming 201967/A13-1 of 4 Nov 93), in which I 
proposed a number of specific measures for developing and 
implementing a system for forming the defense budget. 
  Unfortunately, this letter did not reach the addressee, 
inasmuch as Ye. P. Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian 
Federation government apparat, limited himself to sending off 
copies of the letter and article to the ministries of Finance, 
Economy, and Defense with the request to examine them and give 
the author an answer. (A. S. Mishin was the executor). There was 
no request in Arefyev's letter to inform Gaydar of results of 
the examination. 
  The ministries of Economy and of Defense did not react in 
any 
way to this letter, but the Ministry of Finance sent an 
invitation for an interview on this matter to Tsymbal, B. M. 
Bashuk, a representative of the International Conversion Fund, 
and myself. S. S. Kondrashov, who received us, explained that 
there was no fat of any kind in the defense budget. To the 
contrary, the Ministry of Defense has a catastrophic shortage of 
funds. The existing practice of forming the defense budget 
according to established norms fully suits the Ministry of 
Finance, and so it categorically objects to the monitoring of 
draft defense budgets by independent experts and to removing the 
security classification from materials substantiating the 
defense budget. 
  All our proposals for developing a rational defense budget 
were declined. 
  An official Ministry of Finance response has not been 
received to the aforementioned letter from the Russian 
Federation government apparat up to the present time. But after 
repeated reminders and almost two months after the meeting with 
him, Kondrashov announced that a response had been prepared 
which stated that the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
will not be able to perform the functions of client of the topic 
of developing a system for forming the defense budget. That 
response can attest only to the fact that the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense is not interested in efficient expenditure 
of funds being allocated for defense, which make up over 18 
percent of Russia's budget. 
  Major General (Reserve) S. S. Kondrashov was in charge of 
financial matters in the Ministry of Defense for many long 
years, and in our discussion essentially defended the interests 
not of the Ministry of Finance, but of conservative circles of 
the military department. 
  The reaction to my letter by associates of the Russian 
Federation government apparat and of the Ministry of Finance 
indicates that some of them did not hold the same views as 
Gaydar and B. G. Fedorov or were not interested in lowering 
budget expenditures. 
  This example shows what an important role Russian Federation 
government bureaucrats continue to play in making and 
implementing important decisions. The CPSU was stripped of power 
in 1991 and the Soviets basically were dismissed from power in 
1993, but the power of the bureaucrats has not weakened--it has 
strengthened. In the given instance they do not wish to allow 
monitoring of formation of the defense budget by independent 
experts and consequently the taxpayers. 
  Under the existing conditions I deem it necessary to publish 
my version of the plan of action for removing fat from the 
defense budget. 
  I deem the following steps advisable for a substantial 
improvement in efficiency of expending funds from the defense 
budget: 
  1. State Duma committees for Defense and also for Budget and 
Taxes should make an offer to the Russian Federation government 
to develop a package of documents on regulating the process of 
developing the defense budget. Democratic factions of the Duma 
could act as initiators of this proposal. 
  Based on the proposal of State Duma committees, the Russian 
Federation government should charge the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy with carrying out 
the functions of client for the scientific topic of developing a 
system for forming the defense budget, and also finance the 
topic. 
  2. The topic client is to choose a head executor, which must 
be a nongovernment organization. 
  3. Within a month's time, the head executor of the topic is 
to develop, submit to the client and coordinate with him the 
following: 

  -  draft list of documents necessary for normal functioning 
of the system of forming the defense budget; 
  -  plan and estimate 
of development of documents for the system of forming the 
defense budget and other work on the topic; 
  -  list of 
organizations and establishments which are advisable to involve 
in developing the system of forming the defense budget. 

    4. Draft documents of the system of forming the defense 
budget, developed within time periods prescribed by the plan, 
should be sent through the head executor to all departments and 
organizations participating in developing the defense budget and 
developing documents on the system of forming the defense budget. 
  5. Within the time established by the plan, hold a 
scientific 
conference with involvement of all interested organizations, at 
which discuss draft documents on the system of forming the 
defense budget. 
  6. Based on results of discussion at the scientific 
conference, appropriate developers are to modify documents on 
the system of forming the defense budget and submit them through 
the head developer for approval to the client and to the State 
Duma. 
  7. To evaluate the efficiency of the system of forming the 
defense budget in the course of fulfilling the topic, perform 
calculations for a number of items to substantiate expenditures 
for them for fiscal year 1994 and compare them with expenditures 
envisaged for the defense budget for this year. 
  8. In the State Duma consider the question of establishing a 
defense budget subcommittee made up of the Committee for Defense 
or Committee for Budget and Taxes. 
  9. The Ministry of Defense [and] Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, with involvement of the head 
executor of the aforementioned topic, are to prepare proposals 
to correct the Russian Federation Law on State Secrets of 17 
June 1993 (No 5485-1), providing an opportunity for publishing 
defense budget documents in the mass media, for familiarization 
of independent experts with them, and for submission of 
information on Russia's annual military expenditures to the 
United Nations. 
  The United States of America is rich and well armed also 
because it learned to spend funds for defense very efficiently. 
Russia will not become rich until we learn to do this.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Lashch and Fedor Maksimov: "Abandoned </F>
Missile System Discovered. Armored Missile Train Lost in Perm 
Forests"] 
  [Text] An abandoned rail-based strategic missile 
system has been discovered on the railroad tracks near Perm. The 
discovery by the group of Perm journalists headed by the 
department chief of the oblast newspaper MOLODAYA GVARDIYA, Oleg 
Andriyashkin, was the result of an investigation they conducted: 
The reporters' attention was drawn to the fact that electronic 
equipment intended for "defense purposes" had begun to appear on 
the local market, and then they found the RS-22. After the 
journalists contacted the leaders of the missile forces, the 
six-car train was placed under guard. Yesterday the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY editorial staff learned the details of the 
incident. 
  The Perm journalists reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
editorial offices that at the Kurya Station of the Perm Railroad 
they had discovered a six-car train which, they thought, 
contained an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system. 
  The rail-based RS-22 strategic system is better known 
as the SS-24. It is usually "disguised" as passenger cars or 
refrigerated cars. One system contains up to 10 strategic 
missiles with a target radius of up to 10,000 km. These systems 
were produced in Ukraine in Dnepropetrovsk. They have now been 
removed from production. At the present time they are still on 
combat alert. 
  As the Perm journalist Oleg Andriyashkin told a 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the reporters managed to freely 
enter two cars whose doors had been opened (nobody was guarding 
the equipment). The first of the cars was an electric power 
plant and the second was the main command post. The doors of the 
other four cars, which presumably contained missiles and missile 
fuel, were blocked. The journalists noted that there had been 
some looting of the equipment in the cars. Most likely it was 
not foreign spies who had found their way here but thrifty 
citizens of the country who were interested in the instruments, 
which contain gold and silver and other valuable metals. In 
Andriyashkin's opinion, saboteurs would not be able to use the 
missile system for its intended purpose. The danger came from 
the marauders, who could carelessly set one of the cars on fire. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-13A>           Similar freight cars are found at any </FIG>




<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-13B>          Little remains today of the train's "electronics" </FIG>




  As the deputy chief of the Perm Oblast administration, 
Yevgeniy Sapiro, told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the 
missile system that was discovered is now being used as a 
training facility of the Perm Higher Military School of Missile 
Forces. Representatives of the training institution refrained 
from commentary, alluding to a leadership conference that was 
taking place at that moment. In the press group of the Main 
Commissariat of Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN) they said that 
they had no information on this question: "These missile systems 
are on combat alert and are guarded reliably enough." 
  A worker of the press service of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Vladimir Murashkin, said that the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service knows about the military 
school's written-off training train located at the Kurya station 
of the Perm Railroad, which contains training missiles with the 
warheads removed. From the standpoint of state security the 
system is of no special interest to foreign intelligence 
services--the American military were familiarized with similar 
missile systems not very long ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Krivomazov of the RVSN [Strategic </F>
Missile Troops] Press-group and Aleksandr Dolinin of `Krasnaya 
Zvezda', entitled: "Armored Missile Trains are Not Getting Lost: 
Concerning one `Sensation'".] 
  [Text] Recently our press brought to readers the 
following piece of stunning news: Supposedly, at the Kurya 
station near Perm local journalists discovered an unattended 
element of six train cars, in which, in their opinion, was 
located an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system 
[kompleks]. 
  It is best of all to verify the facts of that kind of 
`sensation'. We in fact did this. But, probably, it makes 
sense to take the opportunity to tell the readers about BZhRK 
[Combat Rail-based (Ballistic) Missile Systems] such as that. 
It is a combat railroad missile system, currently in the 
inventory of the Strategic Missile Troops. It is equipped with 
an RS-22 (SS-24) missile. Its throw-weight is more than 4 
tonnes. 
  The BZhRKs are attached to railroad stations in large oblast 
centers of Russia. In peacetime they stand in well-protected 
zones in readiness to launch a missile or to move out on the 
railroad main line. When there is a threat of attack they may 
be switched to mobile status. 
  The idea of positioning a missile system on a railroad 
platform has a long history. The Americans came closest to it 
at the beginning of the 1970's. However, they did not go all 
the way to the actual repositioning in rail cars of their 
`Minuteman' intercontinental ballistic missiles. Too many 
problems were encountered along the way. 
  The government entrusted the creation of our BZhRK to the 
cooperation of industrial enterprises headed by the `Yuzhnoye' 
scientific-production association. The general designer of this 
system was B.F. Utkin. The railroad system was placed in 
operational service in 1984. Among the missile troops the 
modest name `poyezd' [train] was attached to it. And in fact, 
when viewing the components with refrigerator or passenger cars, 
it was difficult to distinguish it from the common ones. True, 
you do not see people around the `missile train'. They are 
inside, on combat alert duty. The duty combat team serves under 
continuous technical control of the launch systems and the 
missile's on-board systems. The train is provided with modern 
communications, and automated security and defensive equipment. 
  What occurs, if the `Launch' command is received on board 
the 
`missile' train? The BZhRK is fixed in place [?], fastened fast 
to the rails. Having started the launch covers fold to the side 
and a twenty meter cylindrical tower containing the missile 
rises above the car... 
  ...And there, according to the assertion of people in Perm, 
of Moscow journalists, that train appears to have been dropped. 
In actuality that is not the case. 
  As we have already explained, the missile system [Kompleks] 
-- this is the total of functionally connected equipment and 
systems [Sistem] , intended for the launch of a missile, flight 
control and the fulfillment of other tasks. It includes the 
missile and ground equipment. According to their designations 
there are combat, research and training systems [kompleksy]. 
Thus, in the case of the one named in the news reports, only 
portions [elementy] were actually there, and those were only of 
a research rail system [kompleks]. In this object there was 
neither a missile, nor missile fuel, nor will there be. Planned 
firing range tests were conducted on it up till 1990. 
  The Perm journalists' `find' was not lost, but rather was 
transfered in this very year to the Perm VVKUY RV [Higher 
Military Command Engineer School of the Missile Troops], where 
it was used as part of the instructional equipment. The object 
was written off on 22 October 1993, and all secret and valuable 
equipment was removed from it. In essence, the discussion is 
about scrap metal. In a word, the rail-cars, intended for 
dismantling, were preserved. 
  That is the whole truth about the pseudo-sensation. It is 
understood that competent readers, without much effort, can note 
the `ears' [i.e. cover-up] in the publications about the `lost 
armored train'. The rest need not be concerned: The question 
concerns only the next `falsehood'. Certainly no `armored 
train' of the Strategic Missile Troops has been lost. One may 
complain only about another thing -- the fact that readers, 
including journalists, know little about the various missile 
systems and the hard work of those who serve them.

<F P=106> [Article by Major General (retired) Vladimir Semenovich </F>
Belous, head of the Department of Military-Political Studies of 
the Committee of Scientists for Global Security: "Principles of 
Russia's Nuclear Strategy"] 
  [Text] "Political statements of the presidents of the 
two countries about the onset of a new era in relations between 
Russia and the United States cannot in an instant transfer 
relations between the two countries to a fundamentally new 
level." 
  The "Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the 
Russian 
Federation" maintain: "The purpose of the policy of the Russian 
Federation in the sphere of nuclear weapons is the elimination 
of the danger of nuclear war by way of deterring the unleashing 
of aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies." An 
even more complex and multilevel mission is propelled to the 
forefront now--infusing military doctrine with real content. 
  Russia does not consider as its enemy a single country, 
including its recent potential enemy--the United States. But the 
two countries' possession of vast nuclear arsenals determines 
the great time lag of the process of disarmament and transition 
to genuine partnership. The political statements of the 
presidents of the two countries about the onset of a new era in 
relations between Russia and the United States cannot in an 
instant transfer relations between the two countries to a 
fundamentally new level. This will take time. 
  The effective model of the composition, structure, and 
functioning of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, therefore, 
will be constructed on the basis of a policy of deterrence of 
the United States. We would note that, as this condition is 
fulfilled, any other potential enemy is deterred also. Nuclear 
weapons are not regarded as weapons of war here, and their sole 
rational function is deterrence. 
  The future composition and structure of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces will be determined by several basic factors: the 
present composition of the nuclear forces; the status of the 
nuclear arsenals of other states; the limitations imposed on the 
strategic nuclear forces by the Russian-American agreements; 
states' economic possibilities; strategic concepts in respect to 
the use of strategic nuclear forces. 
  As we all know, the operational use of strategic nuclear 
forces is possible by of the delivery of: 

  -  a first or preemptive strike; 
  -  a launch on warning 
[otvetno-vstrechnyy udar]; 
  -  a launch under attack [otvetnyy 
udar]. 

    During the Cold War period the main form of operational use 
of strategic nuclear forces in the event of a conflict was 
considered the delivery against the aggressor of a 
launch-on-warning strike, that is, a firing of missiles prior to 
the moment of impact of enemy warheads on the territory of the 
USSR. A particular role was performed here by the high 
operational readiness of the strategic nuclear forces and their 
flexibility [operativnost] and the dependability of the system 
of operational command and control and communications and also 
the efficiency and dependability of the missile-attack warning 
system. The particular relevance of this form of combat 
operations for the Soviet strategic nuclear forces was 
determined by the great relative significance of ground-based 
ICBM's and their relatively low survivability in the event of a 
nuclear attack against them. At the same time, on the other 
hand, this concept increased the risk of an accidental nuclear 
conflict arising, primarily as a consequence of the 
less-than-absolute dependability of the warning systems. The 
strict time limit at the disposal of our country's leadership in 
the event of a signal having been received from a missile-attack 
warning system (10-12 minutes in the case of an attack by 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles--SLBM's) creates a 
difficult stress situation. A study of various crisis situations 
shows how great is the uncertainty and the probability of an 
inappropriate assessment of the intentions and actions of the 
other side and, as a result, the adoption of the wrong 
decisions. But the operational efficiency of a launch on warning 
is extraordinarily high, which makes it a very powerful means of 
deterrence. 
  The Russian-American agreement on not targeting ballistic 
missiles against one another (it is uncertain as yet whether 
this applies to SLBM's or not, it is true) reduces the risk of 
an accidental nuclear conflict. From the operational-strategic 
viewpoint the agreement also reduces the efficiency of a launch 
on warning. This is particularly sensitive for Russia, for which 
ICBM's account for more than half the nuclear warheads 
(approximately one-fourth for the United States), and the 
off-site restoration of targeting is possible only for new 
classes of missiles. 
  Under the conditions of the lowering of the military 
opposition, the reduction in strategic arms, and the improvement 
in the overall political climate, the probability of the 
delivery of a first nuclear strike is very slight. It would seem 
expedient both for Russia and the United States in the present 
situation, therefore, to renounce the launch-on-warning concept 
and to switch to the launch-under-attack concept. True, this 
form of combat operations is very complicated for the defending 
party and entails great losses of strategic offensive arms and 
the breakdown of facilities of the system of state 
administration and military command and control. As a 
consequence, the efficiency of the retaliatory actions could 
prove very low. A potential aggressor's modeling of such a 
situation could prompt him to take preventive action. An 
orientation in the organizational development of strategic 
nuclear forces solely toward a launch under attack, as some 
analysts are proposing, would make increased demands of their 
quantitative makeup and could create serious impediments in the 
way of a further reduction in strategic nuclear forces. 
  In addition, who could guarantee that complications in 
relations between Russia and the United States will not arise 
and that their interests will not clash in some region of 
geostrategic importance? Consequently, the launch-on-warning 
concept has a right to exist also, and to renounce it 
conclusively would be imprudent. 
  Let us consider one further possible scenario of a military 
conflict. Let us imagine that as a result of territorial claims 
against Russia a country in an alliance with a nuclear power has 
mounted combat operations. Enemy aviation is striking with 
precision weapons at most important targets, including the 
position of the strategic nuclear forces, endeavoring to put 
them out of action. The Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff is 
reporting losses: 15 percent of ICBM launchers have been put out 
of commission. In three days losses have amounted to 25 percent. 
The legitimate question arises: What should Russia's Supreme 
Command do in this situation? What is the permissible limit of 
losses of strategic nuclear forces? The simplest analysis of 
such a situation shows that in the course of combat operations, 
conditions could take shape wherein Russia's strategic nuclear 
forces are forced on pain of destruction to be the first to use 
nuclear weapons. This, inter alia, determines Russia's 
abandonment of the USSR's former undertaking concerning no first 
use of nuclear weapons. 
  At the present time, when the probability of a nuclear 
conflict is very slight, priority significance belongs to the 
launch-under-attack concept, which, most likely, will be 
pertinent in the immediate future also. In the event of a crisis 
situation arising, the launch-on-warning concept could become 
paramount. And, finally, in the event of combat operations being 
unleashed against Russia with the use of conventional weapons, 
conditions objectively determining the need for first use of 
nuclear weapons could take shape. 
  It should be noted that the American strategic nuclear 
forces, both at the present time and following the planned 
reductions, will be oriented toward the accomplishment of the 
entire set of operational assignments. The retention of 500 
highly accurate Minuteman III ICBM's, which are ready within 30 
seconds, assures the delivery of a launch-on-warning strike. In 
addition, according to J. Lynch, captain of the U.S. Navy, the 
system of command and control of America's missile-firing 
submarines permits them to take part in a launch on warning even 
at the present time. The Minuteman III ICBM's in conjunction 
with the Trident II SLBM's, which are fitted with W-88 warheads 
of increased accuracy (400), are also capable of delivering an 
effective first, counterforce strike. For purely retaliatory 
operations the United States would have approximately 1,750 
warheads on SLBM's and some of the weapons on heavy bombers that 
had managed to get airborne on a tactical warning. 
  The main conclusion, therefore, is that the concept of the 
operations of the Russian strategic nuclear forces should be 
multivariant and adaptive and proceed not from scholastic 
deductions but correspond in each period of time to the 
unfolding geostrategic situation and the degree of the military 
threat to Russia. Consequently, the composition and structure of 
the strategic nuclear forces should in any situation assure the 
efficient performance of all forms of combat operations in 
accordance with the said strategic concepts. What does the 
future composition of the strategic nuclear forces of Russia 
look like from these positions? 
  The priority in the organizational development of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces has thus far been assigned ground-based 
ICBM's, on which up to 65 percent of the nuclear weapons have 
been deployed. Approximately 25 percent of the nuclear weapons 
have been installed on SLBM's, and 10 percent, on heavy bombers. 
The United States has traditionally put the emphasis on the 
sea-based component (55 percent of the nuclear weapons), and the 
remainder of the warheads have been shared approximately equally 
between the ICBM's and SLBM's [as published]. This asymmetry in 
the structure of the two countries' strategic nuclear forces has 
come about by no means accidentally, it has reflected the 
particular features of their geostrategic position, basic views 
on the nature of a possible nuclear conflict, and the scientific 
and technological level of the armaments. 
  The START II Treaty determined only two control figures--the 
overall number of warheads on strategic delivery systems (up to 
3,500) and no more than half of them on SLBM's, which affords 
each side the possibility of a display of wide-ranging 
initiative in determination of the composition of its strategic 
offensive arms. Particular significance is attached here for the 
grouping of strategic offensive arms targeted at the delivery of 
a first, counterforce strike to the high accuracy of guidance of 
the warheads to target, which cannot be compensated either by 
their quantity or, even less, by the yield of the weapon. For 
the strategic offensive arms systems intended for retaliatory 
operations, assurance of survivability is the priority. As the 
strategic nuclear forces are reduced, not the quantitative 
parameters of the components of the nuclear triad but their 
operational possibilities and indicators according to the 
"cost-efficiency" criterion will increasingly become paramount. 
  As a result of the structural reorganization of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces there could be a significant increase 
in the proportion of weapons on SLBM's, which would be 
approximately the same as for the United States. But the 
numerical equality of SLBM weapons of Russia and the United 
States obviously assures for the latter, by virtue of the 
qualitative superiority of the American sea-based component, an 
appreciable military advantage. As experience shows, there are 
no more than 20-25 percent of Russia's missile-firing ships on 
operational patrol in the seas at any one time, whereas for the 
United States, up to 40-50 percent. The submarines in base 
become a highly tempting target inasmuch as hundreds of warheads 
deployed on the tied-up missile carriers could be destroyed with 
one or two warheads. 
  Recently the United States and its allies have noticeably 
upgraded the means of observation and the tactics of combating 
submarines. Acoustic antennas, many kilometers long, laid on the 
ocean floor make it possible to keep under constant supervision 
three-fourths of strategically important areas of the Atlantic 
and the Pacific, in which Russian submarines might be operating. 
American multipurpose attack submarines are engaged in constant 
tracking and are perfecting the tactics of combating Russian 
missile carriers in direct proximity to their bases. American 
submarines' repeated encounters with Russian submarines in 
proximity to Russia's shores are convincing testimony to this. 
  The results of the modeling of operational situations in 
ocean expanses performed by Western experts have shown that up 
to 30-40 percent of Russian submarines could be destroyed in the 
course of ASW operations of the initial period of a war. If it 
is considered here that, in the event of a surprise attack, the 
probability of the destruction of the boats in base is very 
high, overall losses in the initial period could amount to 70-80 
percent. Russia's possibilities in the destruction of U.S. 
submarines are far fewer. 
  The fate of the aviation component of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces, which has traditionally been assigned a 
secondary role in all previous nuclear conflict scenarios, will 
remain highly problematical in the coming decade. This is 
explained by the particular features of Russia's geostrategic 
position; the lack of military bases on territory contiguous to 
the United States; the vulnerability to air defense systems; the 
relatively low indicator according to the "cost-efficiency" 
criterion. 
  The situation is further complicated by the fact that a 
substantial portion of the HB (heavy bombers) came to be on the 
territory of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which hastened to declare 
them their property. This has led to Russia being left with only 
27 heavy bombers capable of carrying cruise missiles and 52 
bombers fitted with nuclear bombs. The extraordinarily high cost 
of a heavy bomber, which is particularly sensitive under the 
conditions of economic crisis, does not permit the expectation 
of a serious increase in its aviation component. But its 
preservation as part of the strategic nuclear forces would seem 
necessary inasmuch as heavy bombers with strategic weapons 
possess a number of properties increasing the flexibility of the 
use of the strategic nuclear forces: the presence on them of a 
system of varied nuclear arms, the possibility of hitting 
unplanned targets, and their return to base in the event of a 
change in the situation or a false alarm. 
  The relatively low efficiency of the sea- and air-based 
components of Russia's strategic nuclear forces objectively 
determines the need for the continuation of the lead role of 
ground-based ICBM's. The Strategic Missiles Forces, which are 
armed with ICBM's, stand out to best advantage among the other 
components of the strategic nuclear forces in terms of their 
hardware provision, operational readiness, dependability of the 
system of operational command and control and communications, 
and developed infrastructure. For almost four decades Russia's 
ICBM's have in terms of their technical level and operational 
efficiency not only not been inferior to the U.S. missiles but 
have frequently been superior to them. The upkeep and 
maintenance of the ICBM's cost far less than the other 
components of the triad. In terms of the "cost-efficiency" 
criterion, the Strategic Missile Forces are unparalleled: 
Possessing 65 percent of the warheads, they consume no more than 
10-12 percent of the military budget. 
  There is a serious debate among specialists about the 
structure of the future ICBM grouping. The supporters of mobile 
ICBM's, referring to their alleged high survivability, propose 
that the proportion of these weapons in the Strategic Missile 
Forces' grouping be raised to two-thirds. 
  At the present time even the United States knows the 
coordinates of all the shelters in which the mobile SS-25's 
(Topol) are deployed, and highly sensitive reconnaissance 
apparatus, which covers several frequency bands, has been 
installed on reconnaissance satellites. This permits the 
detection on Earth of objects the size of a football. The 
detection, therefore, of multiple-axle truck tractors moving out 
to the combat patrol area and their further tracking represent a 
perfectly feasible task. It is known also that the United States 
is working on the creation of maneuverable warheads with the 
correction of their flight trajectory at a command from 
reconnaissance satellites, which is particularly relevant for 
destroying moving targets. It was confidence of success in 
combating Russia's mobile ICBM's that prompted the United States 
to lift its objections to their continuation as part of the 
Strategic Missile Forces' grouping. 
  A significant increase in the survivability of mobile ICBM's 
may be achieved only in the event of their being dispersed and 
moved in vast patrolling areas according to the law of chance, 
which would be very hard to accomplish. 
  An increased risk of accidents during movement in the 
patrolling areas, the limited nature of motor capacity, and 
inadequate protection against sabotage and terrorist actions 
should also be attributed to the shortcomings of mobile ICBM's. 
Five or six times more personnel are needed for their 
maintenance than for stationary systems per launcher. Therefore, 
several tens of thousands of additional personnel would be 
required for the creation of a grouping of 600 mobile ICBM's (as 
some specialists are proposing), which under the conditions of 
the difficulty of fully manning the armed forces is of 
considerable importance also. 
  The upkeep and maintenance of mobile ICBM's costs far more 
than silo systems. It needs to be considered also that mobile 
ICBM's are weapons of retaliatory operations and that their 
possibilities in the delivery of first and launch-on-warning 
strikes are highly limited. 
  The attitude toward mobile ICBM's in the United States is 
highly indicative. Previously the Pentagon had planned the 
deployment of MX missile railroad mounts and ground-based 
Midgetman ICBM's. But after a careful analysis of 
operational-strategic, economic, and environmental factors, it 
abandoned its original intentions. The continuous cruising 
around the country's territory of mounts carrying nuclear 
warheads was considered there to be absolutely unacceptable. 
  In accordance with the arguments cited, it is proposed to 
keep the lead position of stationary ICBM's and have a Strategic 
Missile Forces' grouping composed two-thirds of nuclear weapons 
on stationary systems and one-third on mobile systems. This is 
explained by the following considerations. 
  According to the START II Treaty, Russia is entitled to keep 
105 SS-19 ICBM's, leaving on them one warhead each, and also to 
deploy 90 single-warhead missiles in SS-18 ICBM silos converted 
to accommodate them. In addition, it is necessary to convert for 
this same purpose approximately 400 silos on the territory of 
Russia that are currently housing the obsolete SS-11, SS-13, and 
SS-17 missiles. Thus, with the minimum possible economic outlays 
necessary for modernization of the silos and the gradual 
replacement of the missiles, the stationary ICBM grouping would 
number approximately 600 units. 
  This part of the Strategic Missile Forces' grouping would 
have relatively low survivability, but the high operational 
readiness and accuracy of guidance of the warheads would assure 
for these ICBM's, the only ones of Russia's strategic offensive 
arms, the possibility of the delivery of first, counterforce, 
and launch-on-warning strikes, reducing thereby the asymmetry in 
the operational possibilities of strategic offensive arms with 
the United States. This in itself would be a powerful factor of 
deterrence. It would be expedient here to preserve the existing 
grouping of SS-25 mobile ICBM's (approximately 300), with no 
increase. 
  The impending ratification of the START II Treaty by the new 
parliament of Russia will hardly be cloudless, and an acute 
political struggle over it is to be expected. For the successful 
passage through parliament of this most important 
military-political document it is essential that the Government 
of Russia present convincing operational-strategic, 
military-technical, economic, and environmental justification. 
  Unfortunately, it has to be stated that this was not done 
during the hearings on the START II Treaty in the old 
parliament, and the arguments of its opponents frequently 
appeared quite convincing. Therefore, its fate seemed highly 
problematical. Time will tell whether account will be taken of 
the mistakes of the past.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lt-Gen Ilya Grigoryevich Panin, chief of the </F>
RVSN Cadres Directorate, by Aleksandr Dolinin, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent: "There Is Always a Place for Young People in the 
RVSN"] 
  [Text] The Strategic Missile Troops [RVSN] are the 
youngest branch of the Armed Forces. It is noteworthy that about 
half here are young officers. And no matter how the fate of 
these troops unfolds, they are always waiting for young people 
here and counting on them. Our correspondent talks with 
Lieutenant-General Ilya Grigoryevich Panin about how to become 
an officer in the glorious Strategic Missile Troops. 
  [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, have the conditions for 
acceptance into missile schools changed in 1994? 
  [Panin] There are no big differences from past years. The 
schools are open to all Russians. Civilian young people are 
accepted between the ages of 17 and 21 (as of the year of 
admission), and for compulsory-service servicemen and those 
discharged into the reserve the age limit is 23 years. Documents 
are submitted through military commissariats, military units, or 
directly to the chief of the military educational institution 
[VUZ]. Entrance examinations for general education disciplines 
and psychological screening are conducted from the end of June. 
  There are correspondence and classroom preparatory courses 
at 
each of the schools; it is not too late to apply for them now. 
Olympiads and "open houses" are held for applicants. At the 
Rostov Higher Military Command and Engineering School of the 
Missile Troops, for example, a state military-technical lyceum 
is run, most graduates of which are enrolled in this school. 
  Every applicant is tested for physical training (7-11 
pull-ups on a horizontal bar, a 100-meter run, a 3000-meter 
cross-country run, 100-meter swim). As experience shows, this 
poses no special difficulty for most applicants. 
  Tests are taken on general education disciplines: 
Mathematics 
(written), physics, Russian language, and literature (dictation 
or exposition). 
  [Dolinin] What is new in the system of training officer 
personnel? 
  [Panin] New? A lot! First of all, the higher military school 
reform has begun to produce its first fruits. The list of 
officer training specialties and specializations has been 
updated. It has resulted in similar civilian lists adopted in 
the Russian Federation. In accordance with the Law on Military 
Obligation and Military Service, VUZ officer candidates have 
concluded contracts. This gave them a considerable monetary 
raise. Compare: Before signing a contract, 1st and 2nd year 
officer candidates receive up to 24,000 rubles [R] monthly, and 
upon reaching 18 years of age and concluding a contract, they 
receive more than R100,000! The appointment pay for 
lower-echelon commanders and those rated excellent in studies 
has been increased. 
  But this is a concern about officer candidates from the 
material standpoint. It is also manifested in another way--the 
quality of their engineering and military training is 
increasing. Naturally, requirements are also increasing. Today 
we regard officer candidates as future professionals, on whom 
the defensive capability of Russia and its allies will largely 
depend. 
  [Dolinin] Could you go into more detail about updating the 
list of specialties for which future officers are being trained? 
  [Panin] Officer are trained for 73 specialties and 
specializations at RVSN higher military educational 
institutions. Many of them are one of a kind and are unique to 
Russia. For example, beginning this year, graduates will receive 
diplomas for the following specialties: State and regional 
administration; engineer protection of the environment; 
geophysical methods of search and surveying; laser systems; 
automated information processing and control systems; robots and 
robotics... What is especially important is that out of all the 
diversity of the specialties, there is not a single one which 
would not find application in various sectors of the economy, 
science, and production. All officer candidates are on familiar 
terms with computers. 
  At our VUZes, officer candidates are given the opportunity 
to 
receive two or more specialties and defend two diplomas right 
away. One can master the program of instruction in 4 years 
instead of 5. The best graduates have an opportunity to go on to 
graduate work, which our educational institution has. It would 
be an aspiration. 
  [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, future applicants are 
interested 
in finding out if there is a chance graduates might end up 
without a job given the objective reduction of the Missile 
Troops? 
  [Panin] In accordance with the SOA-1 and SOA-2 [Strategic 
Offensive Arms] treaties, the strength of the grouping is indeed 
being reduced. But officers will always be needed in the troops, 
especially in primary positions. Last year's graduates have been 
fully placed and are conscientiously performing their military 
duty. The Missile Troops are the youngest branch of the armed 
forces, and all paths are open to young people here.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel G. Rudyuk of the SibVO </F>
[Siberian Military District]: "The [Signal] Communications of an 
Artillery Battalion"] 
  [Text] The specific nature of the combat tasks performed by 
a battalion of towed artillery has a significant impact on 
questions of organizing signal communications. I will consider 
how they should be organized today in optimal fashion, in my 
opinion, in order to provide for the reliable exchange of all 
types of information for the command and control of fire 
subunits in any situation. 
  The command and control of batteries and platoons in a 
battalion, as a rule, is performed from tactical command posts 
[KNPs] (forward, lateral and fire-control point) by means of the 
issuance of oral combat orders, directives and commands. The 
latter are transmitted by radio and wireline communications 
channels, as well as with the aid of mobile and signals gear. 
  Combat command and control vehicles (MBU) are deployed at 
all 
PUs [command posts] of a subunit to perform the tasks of 
communications: A 1V19 (battalion commander) at the adn 
[artillery battalion] KNP, a 1V111 (chief of staff) at the PUOD 
[battalion fire-control center], a 1V13 (battery commander) at 
the abatr [artillery battery] KNP, and a 1V110 (senior battery 
officer) at the abatr PUO [fire-control post]. An MBU has a 
radio set, cable, telephone gear, switchboards, 
data-transmission gear, devices for the automatic entry of data 
into a communications channel, a computer and other gear. The 
command and control squad of an adn also has a portable R-159 
and several kilometers of P-274M, as well as more than ten 
TA-57s. 
  Experience shows that reliable communications can be 
organized with the higher commander and staff, as well as with 
all elements of the order of battle of the battalion, using this 
hardware. 
<H5>  Wireline Communications </H5>
  Wireline communications are widely employed in an artillery 
battalion in defense, at a staging area, and at firing positions 
occupied for the support of combined-arms subunits in an attack 
by them on the enemy's forward line. 
  It should be kept in mind that wireline communications 
cannot 
be fully planned in the battalion and battery in the course of 
an offensive battle. In certain cases when the pace of the 
offensive is slowed and the firing positions (OP) are moved less 
often (when penetrating deeply echeloned enemy defenses, at 
lines of resistance, when repelling enemy counterstrikes and 
counterattacks, when forcing water obstacles etc.). However, 
this type of communications must also be established in the 
course of battle. It is important to recall here that wireline 
communications should be operating under any conditions between 
the fire-control post of an adn and the firing positions of an 
abatr. 
  We will investigate one variation for the organization of 
such communications, proceeding from the assumption that the 
battalion has been attached to a motorized-rifle battalion that 
is operating in defense (see Fig. 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-21A> Fig. 1. Diagram of wireline </FIG>







    Communications employing wireline methods are established 
from the battalion KNP with the regimental KP [command post] 
(PAG [regimental artillery group]), the PUOD (adn staff), the 
KNPs of the batteries, the PNP [forward observation posts] (or 
BNP [lateral observation posts]) of the adn, and with the 
combined-arms subunit to which the battalion is attached or 
which it is supporting with fire. 
  The communications with the commander and staff of the 
motorized-rifle regiment [msp], in accordance with the 
communications instructions of the msp staff, are planned and 
executed by the manpower and equipment of the regiment on a 
P-274M cable link. It runs from the US [communications center] 
of the msp KP to the US of the adn KNP. 
  In certain cases, when the staff (PUOD) of the battalion is 
at the firing positions and when time and means are available, a 
separate link can be run from the US of the higher commander to 
the US of the fire-control post of the adn. A cable line laid 
from the US of the msp KP to the msb KNP is used as an 
alternative link of wireline communications with the higher 
commander or staff. 
  Wireline communications are organized with elements of the 
battalion order of battle, with the heaquarters (PUOD) and PNP 
(BNP) of the adn and the KNP of the abatr by directive of the 
battalion staff, using the manpower and equipment of the command 
and control platoon on links run from the adn KNP US to the 
subunits by P-274M cable. 
  If the line running to one of the batteries is damaged, the 
communications of the battalion commander with the subunit 
commander may be supported on the link between the msb KNP and 
the msr KNP that is maintained by the given abatr. 
  The fire-control point of the adn also maintains 
communications with the firing positions of the batteries on 
links deployed using P-274M cable. This provides an opportunity 
for the battalion chief of staff [NSh] to have communications 
with the senior commanders of the abatr that are at the firing 
positions. The NSh can also maintain contact with the battery 
commanders through the adn KNP US or the firing batteries. The 
latter is accomplished using P-193M telephone switchboards in 
the MBU of the abatr senior commanders. 
  The telephone gear of the adn commander must be linked 
through the P-193M switchboard with the communications lines 
running to the KNP of the batteries, which are in turn hooked up 
to the cable running to the firing positions, for centralized 
fire control. 
  The transmission of commands directly to the abatr OP 
[firing 
positions] is possible here as well, by P-274M running between 
the KNP and the PUO of the battalion, and on lines going from 
the fire-control post to the POP [forward defensive positions] 
of the batteries. The circular connection of all operators 
(senior commanders of the abatr) with the battalion commander at 
the switchboard is executed for this purpose in the MBU of the 
chief of staff. 
  The cable line from the KNP of a nearby battery with its 
firing position can also be used as a supplementary 
communications channel between the commander and the NSh of the 
adn. 
  Wireline communications are established in a battery from 
its 
KNP with the firing positions, the fire-control post and the 
forward (or lateral) observation posts along P-274M cable links 
using the manpower and resources of the headquarters platoon of 
the battery. The communications line with the main OP is best 
laid with a back-up. P-274M must also be run to the parking 
location of the abatr prime movers from the POP. 
  Wireline communications are provided by separate link using 
the manpower and resources of the artillerymen with the 
commanders of combined-arms subunits when their KNPs are placed 
apart. 
<H5>  Radio Communications </H5>
  Recall that radio in the battalion remains the principal, 
and 
in some cases, the sole means of command and control of subunits 
of the adn and their fire and maneuver. The radio net is the 
most acceptable form of communications therein. 
  Radio communications are employed in all types of battle. 
The 
stations, however, usually operate for receiving, and are turned 
on to transmit only when the wirelines are damaged. The 
operation of the radio without restrictions is permitted only 
with the start of preparation fire. 
  When a battalion moves from a staging area to an OP, as well 
as when on the move in anticipation of battle, radio 
communications may be used to transmit brief signals on the 
passing of traffic-control lines or entry into a meeting 
engagement. 
  One variation for the organization of a radio net in an adn 
composed in a manner that would permit stable fire control in 
the course of a battle without substantial changes in 
configuration is presented in Fig. 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-23A>           Fig. 2. Diagram of radio </FIG>





    The commander and staff of the battalion maintain 
communications with the commander and staff of the msp by 
shortwave radio net by periodically turning on their own sets in 
the net. Since the PUs of combined-arms and artillery commanders 
most often coincide, the radio net of the former may be used as 
alternative links. 
  The communications of the adn commander with the regimental 
artillery chief is organized by USW radio net. The sets of the 
PUOD, commanders and senior commanders of the batteries, as well 
as the commanders of the mortar batteries of the regimental 
motorized-rifle battalions, can be included in it when there is 
centralized fire control. 
  The adn commander, in a case where the battalion is part of 
a 
regimental artillery group, establishes communications with the 
PAG commander by including the R-123M in the radio net of the 
PAG commander. The adn NSh may also be tuned into it. 
  The adn commander controls the battery commanders on his own 
USW radio net. It also includes the stations of the chief of 
staff (PUOD), battalion PNP (BNP) and abatr POP. The adn 
commander organizes communications with the chief of staff on a 
SW radio link. 
  The chief of staff of an adn with an MBU provides for the 
direct fire control of the batteries. A special radio net for 
automatic data transmission using R-111 and R-123M sets is 
created for the transmission of data being processed with the 
aid of computer gear. Automatic receivers are established at the 
battery positions, and which receive commands from the MBU of 
the NSh, where there is a device for the automatic entry of 
information into the communications line. 
  Communications with the artillery reconnaissance elements of 
the motorized-rifle division are accomplished by including the 
USW-band sets of the commander, NSh and PNP (BNP) of the 
battalion and the battery commanders in the corresponding radio 
net. 
  Data from division artillery reconnaissance may be received 
right from a mobile command reconnaissance post or from a 
helicopter. A portable R-159 must be mounted in an Mi-2kr in the 
latter case. 
  The command and control of adn reconnaissance elements is 
accomplished from the PRP-3 on the radio net of the battalion, 
using USW sets that are placed at the adn PNP or the abatr PNP 
(BNP). 
  The communications of the commander of the motorized-rifle 
battalion and the artillery battalion are maintained by means of 
personal interchange when they have a joint KNP, or by the entry 
of the adn commander's R-123 into the radio net of the 
motorized-rifle battalion commander, as well as through an 
artillery officer who is at the motorized-rifle battalion KNP 
with his own set. 
  The adn and tank subunits commanders interact using the 
radio 
net of the attached tanks. It may be composed of the sets of the 
commanders of the motorized-rifle battalion, the combat tanks 
and the battalion commander. 
  Data on the weather situation is received on the radio nets 
of the senior commanders, by means of the inclusion in them of 
an R-326 and R-123M receiver at the PUOD and an R-123M at the 
battalion KNP. 
  A USW radio net of the abatr commander is organized to 
control the fire of the battery and receive data from the PNP 
(BNP) on the results of the firing and fire correction by order 
of the adn staff. It is composed of the sets of the battery 
commander and the senior battery officer and the PNP (BNP). The 
radio net may in certain cases also include the gun commanders. 
  The senior battery officer maintains contact with the 
commanders of the firing platoons on his USW radio net using 
R-147 radios. The R-147P receivers of the gun commanders are 
part of that as well. 
  The discussions of the abatr commander and the 
motorized-rifle battalion are conducted, as a rule, through 
personal interchange. When they are not located together, radio 
communications between them are established through the 
commander of the headquarters platoon, who is located with a 
radio with the commander of the motorized-rifle company. 
  The interaction of the commanders of the batteries and the 
tank subunit are best planned to be on the radio net of the 
abatr commander, through the PNP that is with the tank battle 
formations. 
  Radio communications for interaction between the adn battery 
commanders are best accomplished on the radio net of the 
battalion commander, with the permission of the net control 
station or by mutual entry into the corresponding nets. 
  Warning signals of enemy use of weapons of mass destruction 
are received on the radio net of the senior officer. 
Notification of subordinate subunits is provided on all 
operating radio nets and wireline communications lines, and is 
above all precedence. 
  The command and control of the adn is performed by radio in 
the course of battle. The battalion commander moves in the MBU, 
the gear of which allows him to have solid communications with 
the senior commander and the battery commanders. He maintains 
communications with the higher headquarters, the commanders of 
the adn and abatr, the PNP (BNP) of the adn and the commander of 
the tank subunit attached to the motorized-rifle battalion. 
  The battery commander's MBU moves at some distance from the 
motorized-rifle battalion commander's KNP in the dynamic of 
battle, and is in constant contact with him. If a company 
commander is moving in the foot formation, the abatr commander 
or headquarters platoon commander follows close behind him with 
the radio. 
  I would note in conclusion that this article shows 
variations 
for radio and wireline communications, the utilization of which 
gives good results in practice in the command and control of an 
artillery battalion and the maintenance of continuous 
interaction with motorized-rifle and other subunits.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Igor Andreyev: "Aircraft </F>
Competition: MiG or YaK?"; first paragraph is IZVESTIYA 
introduction] 
  [Text] In the waning days of February, two leading aviation 
development bureaus will present the Russian Federation Air 
Forces with competing proposals for a new generation of fighter 
aircraft. The one chosen as the winner by military aviators will 
be granted the honor of providing this kind of aircraft not only 
to Russia and the CIS member countries, but to numerous 
customers located in distant foreign countries as well. 
  IZVESTIYA has already discussed one of the competitors 
(issue 
No 25 of 1994). This is the MiG firm, which is widely known 
domestically and in foreign countries. Equally famous is its 
rival in creative commercial endeavors, the YaK corporation, 
which was the traditional supplier of "flying classrooms" to 
Soviet aviation and our former allies. The need for this kind of 
aircraft is great, since Russia alone will require 800 aircraft 
for employment in the so-called advanced pilot training. Taking 
into account the needs of the CIS member countries and "Third 
World" states, the total amount needed is about 1,200 new 
aircraft. The production program is enormous, with the potential 
of effecting a substantial change in the nature of Russian 
exports, an area in which no boasts of a preponderance of 
science-intensive products can be made. 
  YaK, hoping to emerge as the winner of the competition, has 
its eyes set not only on financing a military aviation program, 
but more on mass use of this aircraft, thus attracting the 
undivided attention of potential foreign purchasers and serving 
as a reliable indication of quality of the fighter. In any 
event, this is the view held by the corporation's foreign 
partner, Aeromacchi, Italy's oldest aircraft manufacturer. The 
Italians became familiar with the YaK-130 project in last year's 
air show at Le Bourget, where they expressed a desire to become 
part of a deal -- to participate in creating the machine and 
selling series-produced craft in their traditional markets 
located in Southeastern Asia, the Near East, South America, and 
even New Zealand. The Russian side will handle sales at home and 
in the CIS. Also contributing to a great need for a new trainer 
in our country is the fact that mutual payments between the 
Comecon partners were made in currency, at full world prices, 
for components and spare parts supplied to Russia by Hungary, 
the Czech Republic, or the Slovak Republic. One has only to 
realize that the obsolete Czechoslovak L-39s, which were used to 
teach at least two generations of our pilots to fly, are sitting 
on the ground -- hundreds of them -- due to a shortage of spare 
parts. To prevent this kind of trouble, the Air Forces have 
served the designers with a strict requirement: All components 
must necessarily be manufactured domestically. Strange as it may 
seem, the Yak-130's most important assembly, the engine, will be 
supplied by Slovakia, of all places. That is, Russian engine 
designers have been hard at work coming up with a modification 
of the small power plant, long produced in that country under 
Soviet licence, for installation in this aircraft. The "prodigal 
son," which has been ransomed from the Slovaks to obtain rights 
to series production in its homeland, will be returning home. 
  This year, the Yak-130 will be fabricated "in the flesh" and 
flight testing initiated. Nowhere in the world is there yet an 
aircraft possessing such superior flight and technical 
characteristics. It is the only craft capable of flying at 
extreme angles of attack fatal for other aircraft and of 
executing the famous Pugachev Cobra. Built into the design of 
the controls is the capability of changing their "habits" to 
endow the aircraft with the characteristics of the basic fighter 
models in the inventory of our Air Forces and those of foreign 
countries. The design computations of the YaK people are being 
closely followed by the Aeromacchi specialists, who wish to end 
up with a flying craft offering the same characteristics the 
project calls for. Of importance in addition to the purely 
tactical characteristics are economic considerations, an example 
of which is the requirement for lowering the cost of one hour of 
flight of the Yak-130 by one order of magnitude, that is, by a 
factor of 10, as compared to that of the Su-27. 
  If the YaK corporation wins the competition, its trainers 
will be made available in 1997 to customers located in Russia 
and in foreign countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation First Deputy Minister </F>
of Defense Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin by Captain 2nd Rank Ye. 
Vodopyanov: "Russia Needs a Proper Navy"] 
  [Text] During the course of preparations for the Russian 
Navy's 300th Anniversary celebration, besides pride for its 
glorious many-century history, military seamen are also 
experiencing well-grounded concern for the navy's future. It is 
already a fact that last year, for the first time in many 
decades, not a single ship was laid down at Russia's shipyards 
and the completion of ships that they had begun building was 
terminated or is being conducted at extremely low rates in the 
background of the massive withdrawal of both obsolete combatants 
and ships and also those that we could quite well preserve with 
proper repair and modernization from the navy's combat strength 
-- this causes nothing other than bitterness for people who are 
devoted to the sea. How do we explain the situation that has 
developed -- is it due only to economic difficulties or, maybe, 
it is due to the sum total of other causes as well? Our 
correspondent's conversation with Russian Federation First 
Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin began 
with that question. 
  [Kokoshin] The Russian Navy's difficult situation is 
explained not only by the complexities of the current situation 
in Russia and by the political and economic consequences of the 
collapse of the USSR, but also by past mistakes in the 
construction of the navy when combatants, basing and 
ground-based support and maintenance systems were built; that 
is, everything that is called infrastructure was not developed 
to the proper extent. We can say the same thing about naval 
weapons and also about reconnaissance and target designation 
systems. Another aspect: Even after their acceptance into the 
inventory, as they say, "we spent a lot of time figuring out how 
to use" the ships and naturally they could not completely 
accomplish their combat missions. What is more, at the present 
time the missile cruiser "Petr Velikiy" is being completed at 
the Baltiysk Plant. Only presently will all of the weapons 
appear on the fourth ship of that design that should have been 
installed on the first. The enormous delays with time periods 
for the development of the combatants' assemblies and individual 
elements and weapons systems are also having an impact. So the 
navy is also a victim of the extremely difficult crisis 
situation of our economy and, at the same time, of those 
problems of ship construction that have accumulated over the 
last several decades. 
  [Vodopyanov] Obviously, the serious situation with housing 
and other social support issues which have developed in the 
fleets could also be included here? 
  [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. The trouble is that the ships, 
including even the outstanding ones -- were developed and 
essentially they forgot about people. This concerns not only the 
officers but also the rank and file. And we think that a large 
number of accidents in the navy, including cases of suicides, 
are associated with the fact that the crews are in the enclosed 
area of ship spaces for too long a time and the conditions for 
full-fledged rest have not been created for them on shore. 
  [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, since we were speaking 
about the development of the navy's infrastructure, this is a 
logical question: What is currently being done to resolve the 
problems which you mentioned? 
  [Kokoshin] The development of a basing and life-support 
system -- that is a long-term program which must be designed for 
15-20 years. In the process, we need to proceed from the fact 
that the idea for the dispersal of infrastructure basing 
facilities for ship task forces that are tasked for operations 
in one or several nearby operating areas has become obsolete. A 
massive strike, even not by nuclear but by conventional 
precision-guided weapons, will destroy practically all of the 
facilities, no matter how much we try to separate one from the 
other. Therefore, I think the point of view of those experts who 
propose locating the fleets at several bases that are united 
through life-support technology of ships and weapons and the 
utilization of the men and equipment for armed combat at sea is 
justified. That concentration of forces provides a colossal 
advantage both for the development of the navy's infrastructure 
and for the development of normal living conditions for 
servicemen and their families. 
  [Vodopyanov] In the process, obviously we need to proceed 
from our state's actual conditions and capabilities? 
  [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. Unfortunately, only today are we 
beginning to really consider money, which you can't say, for 
example, about the Americans, Germans or British. They will not 
invest their resources until they become convinced that each 
dollar, mark, or pound will provide the maximum return. In 
Russian history, during the reform period Grand Prince 
Konstantin Nikolayevich -- General-Admiral of the Russian Navy 
-- and his comrades-in-arms-reformers devoted quite a bit of 
attention to the analysis of that which we now call 
"cost-effectiveness". Today, each of our commanders, I am 
already not talking about the commanders-in-chief, must become 
an economist. The navy -- and it is the general customer for its 
arms in the person of the commanders of the highest level, 
headquarters and other command and control organs, is obliged to 
know how to analyze what is more advantageous for it. By way of 
illustration -- will it purchase five new destroyers or 
modernize ten that are already in the line; lay down a new 
nuclear submarine or modernize one that has already recommended 
itself well; order a new cruiser or invest money in the 
development of the infrastructure and life-support of existing 
ships?... 
  Of course, to do that, we in the Armed Forces need to have 
strong economic services and one of our most important missions 
is to instill in commanders of all levels a taste for 
painstaking analysis of the monetary resources that we have and 
in the combat effectiveness of those weapons that we are 
purchasing with this money. 
  [Vodopyanov] However, to do that commanders need to 
precisely 
know what the Russian Ministry of Defense and you, as first 
deputy Minister of Defense, see as the navy's role in the 
contemporary conditions; what is the current concept of its 
construction? It's no secret that even before the impression has 
been formed that current Russian military doctrine has devoted 
and devotes inadequate attention to the navy. 
  [Kokoshin] There has always been a dual attitude toward the 
navy in Russia. On the one hand, they loved it with some sort of 
special love and Russians I would say have a definite 
subconscious craving for the sea. No wonder the periods of its 
isolation ended with access to the seas that wash today's 
Russia, initially -- in the West and South (the Baltic, Black 
and Caspian seas), then -- in the East (the Pacific Ocean). On 
the other hand -- due to our geostrategic position, we 
traditionally are more a land than a sea power and Russia's 
military fate has been decided, as a rule, on land. Of course, 
there were critical moments and sea battles, like Tsushima, that 
determined the further foreign policy and internal situation of 
the Russian state. And yet the outcome of wars: the Patriotic 
War of 1812, and the First and Second World Wars -- were 
predetermined in the depth of Russian territory. But this 
occurred not only due to Russia's natural geographic position 
but, it seems to me, due to the ambivalent attitude toward the 
navy. It experienced both periods of great enthusiasm and 
profound crises. And that alternation was repeated more than 
once in Russia's history -- we must not forget that. Recall 
that, after Peter the Great, the navy was very rapidly brought 
into a deep decline by his successors. Then matters were put 
right to a certain extent under Elizabeth Petrovna but we also 
cannot say that the navy was in a brilliant situation. It 
experienced a golden age during the reign of Catherine the 
Great. It is in this period that the names of Senyavin, Greyg, 
and Ushakov, whose fame equaled the fame of Rumyantsev and 
Suvorov, were heard throughout the entire world. Under Pavel I, 
the navy was still maintained but, under Aleksandr I, the navy 
once again found itself in a difficult position, they were 
involved very little with it and, how paradoxical, but the fact 
is that the name of the Naval Minister, the Marquis de Traverse, 
was the most hated name for seamen of that time. However, 
everything was decided not by him, he was acting only as the 
instrument of the upper levels. Although the role of personality 
in the navy was always great and its rebirth, at least, of the 
Black Sea Fleet, in the first half of the 19th century was 
associated first of all with the name of Admiral Lazarev. Later 
there was the Crimean War when the navy found itself defenseless 
against the enemy's armored steam ships and Russian admirals, 
officers and sailors became heroes of the land defense of 
Sevastopol. We recall the already mentioned Tsushima and 1918 
when a large portion of the Black Sea Fleet was actually sunk... 
In general, the Russian Navy had a great, at times tragic, 
history and it is more complex than the history of the Armed 
Forces as a whole. Yes and in the recent past, during the 
1960's, the navy was subjected to a fierce blow when nearly new 
ships that had far from exhausted their combat capabilities were 
sent to the scrap heap. 
  [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, you have quite 
legitimately 
pointed out that we should not forget history, including the 
history of the navy. But is that being taken into account in the 
new shipbuilding program? 
  [Kokoshin] I would not say that we have a new shipbuilding 
program in its traditional sense. I think that there should be 
an arms development program on the whole where the navy would be 
a component. This is not only a question of ships but also of 
coastal missile systems, naval aviation and naval infantry... 
But the main thing, I repeat -- is the improvement of the basing 
system and the repair system. It is this development program 
--without a one-sided slant toward shipbuilding -- that we need. 
All the more so that this is being dictated by the situation 
that has developed as a result of the dismemberment of the 
Soviet Union, in the Black and Baltic Seas and in the Caspian 
Sea. As for the ships, I, in particular, think that the idea of 
creating a relatively small aircraft-carrying ship deserves the 
most rapt attention. In general, we need new inspiring ideas 
like we need air and the realization of these ideas will allow 
us to live for years while saving what we have. Let the navy's 
youth have their say here... 
  [Vodopyanov] But you need to know what criteria will 
determine the navy's quantitative and qualitative composition in 
order to advance, as you say, the "ideas" of that same navy 
youth. 
  [Kokoshin] Russia certainly needs a powerful modern navy, 
without quantitative excesses, but with high parameters of 
combat and operational effectiveness; a navy that would be 
blended into the integrated military doctrine. Under current 
conditions, it is especially important that all Armed Forces 
branches and types of troops precisely interact with each other. 
Of course, right now there is no optimum in this sphere. As for 
the missions being accomplished by the navy, I think that they 
are first of all associated with ensuring Russia's security in 
certain areas and zones that are adjacent to its territory and 
providing reliable nuclear deterrence, along with the Strategic 
Missile Forces and strategic long-range aviation. Preservation 
of its ocean function based upon certain parameters will be one 
of the navy's most important missions, primarily, in the context 
of reconnaissance, information gathering, and studying the 
hydrologic situation. Among the combat missions -- maintenance 
of the stability of strategic nuclear submarines and the 
creation of those regimes of the combat service of ships that 
would permit us to predominate in the most vulnerable nearby 
ocean zones for Russia and also in certain key areas of the 
World Ocean in the event of political crises and military 
operations. 
  [Vodopyanov] But what is the basis for accomplishing what 
has 
been planned? Today much is being said and, it seems to us, in a 
substantiated manner about the inadequately thought through 
defense industry conversion policy which has brought our 
military-industry complex to the point of collapse and to the 
loss of its leading positions. 
  [Kokoshin] I must admit that our conversion policy was not 
in 
earnest, although efforts were carried out to shift the 
military-industrial complex to the output of peaceful 
production. But we needed to conduct such a program over the 
course of 10-15 years and mandatorily under the condition of the 
stability of state rule. We can consider the conversion program 
that was proposed within the framework of the old system as only 
a conversion palliative. Under conditions when weakened 
"civilian" plants "have been attached" to military-industrial 
complex enterprises, it could have operated only in the presence 
of directive force. And, of course, the conversion policy must 
have powerful market stimuli and be built-in to the overall 
strategy of economic reform and independent of orders from above. 
  [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, right now how can you 
characterize the state of the industrial complex that supports 
the navy's needs? 
  [Kokoshin] It is very serious. Essentially, right now we are 
struggling for the survival of the Armed Forces, including the 
navy, and for the preservation of industry, although in those 
amounts which would ensure the maintenance of the army and navy 
at the required combat readiness. This is an extremely difficult 
task. When you say that you need to reduce military orders and 
the number of plants, the director's corps of defense 
enterprises agrees with that. But as soon as matters directly 
affect the directors, they begin "to wiggle out of the 
situation": They say, let's reduce the orders for others, but 
you don't need to reduce my order. But then again, we have also 
been compelled to reduce many developments to the limit, any 
further, figuratively speaking, and we'll have to cut to the 
bone. 
  For example, we defined Severodvinsk and Sevmash enterprise 
as the center of nuclear submarine building. Now all orders will 
go only there. But we need to bring the submarines that are in 
the Far East up to readiness. We are finishing some at Nizhniy 
Novgorod and large surface ships -- at Kaliningrad and St. 
Petersburg... 
  [Vodopyanov] Does it once again turn out that it is the navy 
that is enduring the greatest damage of all of the Armed Forces 
branches? 
  [Kokoshin] That is occurring due to its specific nature, due 
to the duration of the shipbuilding cycle and to the fact that 
they are entire floating cities in which much of what there is 
in the Air Force, the missileers and PVO [Air Defense] is 
combined... Therefore, right now those super-powerful weapons 
systems are suffering most of all. The specific nature of 
current industrial production and the fact that there are no 
strict rules that regulate the conduct of first and second level 
subcontractors-assemblers -- who are very rapidly shifting to 
the output of civilian products for which there is demand -- is 
also having an impact. Military orders have become unprofitable 
due to the lack of financial resources... 
  [Vodopyanov] ...As a result, if previously seamen frequently 
complained about a number of low tactical-technical parameters 
of newly built ships and inadequate standardization of weapons 
and combat equipment with which they were equipped. Today, the 
navy is more concerned about the reduction of deliveries of not 
only new and modern weapons but of even series-produced weapons. 
Will it not turn out that the Russian Navy will greet its 300th 
Anniversary not only without new ships but also with weapons of 
the "era of Ochakov and the conquest of Crimea"? 
  [Kokoshin] You very legitimately pose that question. I think 
that we need to maintain a course toward preserving in the line 
even few combat ships but the most modern and actually combat 
ready, as you say in the navy -- of the first line. Of course, 
these requirements also relate to aviation and to the other 
branches of the Armed Forces and especially to the navy. We must 
be certain: If ships carry the navy flag and are in the line, 
then we can count on them. Furthermore, there must be reserve 
ships with reduced levels of combat readiness and with lower 
manning than those belonging to the first line. Of course, we 
need to equip both these and the others with modern weapons. But 
here too there are a large number of obstacles. 
  [Vodopyanov] Could we dwell on this important aspect in more 
detail? 
  [Kokoshin] In the former USSR, the expenditure mechanism of 
the entire weapons life cycle -- from development to scrapping 
-- dominated. Frequently the main thing was to report on the 
development of a project, say, of a new ship, for which awards 
and prizes were given. As it turned out later, the ships, 
weapons systems and life-support, rescue systems and 
survivability were far from perfect in a number of cases due to 
this "reporting". Moreover, the overwhelming majority of weapons 
models were developed without designing for modernization. We 
are suffering to this day because of that because it is 
impossible to install new electronics and acoustics systems and 
modern types of antennas on ships of the majority of designs. 
  But I think that the greatest deficiency in domestic 
shipbuilding is the absence of a macro systems approach to the 
construction and development of the navy, including basing 
infrastructure, when the adjustment of the quantitative and 
qualitative composition of the navy of the graphically 
heightened requirements of the naval strategy (let's recall 
Admiral Gorshkov's "ocean strategy") was implemented in a 
strong-willed manner and was frequently dictated not by the navy 
but by the decisions of the military-industrial complex. There 
was nothing that defined the military shipbuilding strategy -- a 
state program that coordinated goals, time periods and 
engineering tasks and was the same for all NII's and KB's 
[design bureaus], shipbuilding plants, shipyards, and docks. But 
those same Americans and Germans, who are somewhat wealthier 
than we are, built ships with a long-range sight. A classic 
example of the management attitude toward ships are the Iowa 
Class Battleships. And right now where are our design 68-bis gun 
cruisers which were distinguished by their beautiful ship 
architecture and good sea-going qualities?! 
  [Vodopyanov] Today the navy has lost (primarily due to the 
weakly-developed infrastructure of coastal basing) newer ships, 
for example, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers "Kiev", 
"Minsk" and "Novorossiysk", each of which did not serve for 20 
years... 
  [Kokoshin] That is because, as I already said above, that we 
were always rushing after quantity while ignoring the 
qualitative characteristics of the navy and not paying attention 
to the expenditures that especially increase during the 
operation of ships and their basing facilities that have not 
been perfected. Today we are compelled to consider every ruble 
--there is a catastrophic shortage of resources. Under these 
conditions, how do we conduct the optimization of expenditures 
for the purchase of equipment and weapons, for shipbuilding and 
repair, and for NIOKR [scientific research and experimental 
design work]? Therefore, in the near future we will not be able 
to count on new grandiose projects but we need to resolve more 
prosaic issues in order to preserve the maximum of what we have 
in the navy today. And the navy's primary mission in the next 
2-3 years is -- survival. I will point out, not vegetation, but 
survival with the evolutionary accumulation of combat might, 
through structural and operational reorganization, being 
inspired by a high idea: By the historical greatness of the 
Fatherland, and by a consciousness of the need for its Armed 
Forces and the navy, in particular. We must not forget that the 
navy is also a special instrument of the state through which not 
only purely military but also political missions are carried 
out. I have in mind showing the Russian flag. I am convinced 
that we must continuously carry out the latter and here there is 
no place for a bookkeeping approach. A combat ship, especially 
-- a pretty one (and Soviet, currently Russian, ships are 
praised for their architecture) always causes admiration and 
respect. And we need to develop a unique type of philosophy for 
the utilization of the navy when the navy, without directly 
entering into combat operations but simply cruising off the 
coasts or even being beyond the horizon, acts as a powerful 
factor of restraint of an aggressor and influences political 
"solitaire" along with other measures and techniques. 
  [Vodopyanov] All the more so that the Russian and Soviet 
Navy 
has that experience... 
  [Kokoshin] I have talked a lot with navy veterans who 
repeatedly sailed in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Indian and 
Pacific oceans. Undoubtedly, in an entire series of cases, our 
navy played a very important role when a situation was 
stabilized at a comparatively low level of escalation of some 
conflict or other by sending a detachment of our ships. No one 
is guaranteeing that military threats to Russia's security in 
the world will be totally reduced to naught. So we need to be 
realists -- we can't get by without a navy that is proper for 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Major-General of Aviation (Retired) K. Shpilev </F>
and Candidate of Technical Sciences Professor Lieutenant-Colonel 
Ye. Matveyev: "Specific Features of Aviation Engineer Support 
for the Combat Operations of Ground Forces Aviation"] 
  [Text] The improvements in the structure of the Ground 
Troops, accompanied by changes in their force composition and 
their saturation with air units (helicopter units in 
particular), require corresponding changes in aviation engineer 
support (IAO) for combat operations. This is commonly taken to 
mean the whole set of measures performed by engineering and 
technical personnel, aimed at maintaining aircraft hardware and 
the means of operating and repairing it in constant readiness 
for battle. The structural changes have unfortunately not yet 
had much of an impact on the organization of IAO in Ground 
Troops Aviation. 
  The simultaneous use of a base airfield and sites for the 
dispersal of groups of helicopters, with the prolonged conduct 
of combat operations by small groups, pairs and individual 
helicopters separated from their permanent base locations, as is 
well known, is typical of Ground Troops' Aviation. This latter 
circumstance, as a rule, is the focus in the organization of IAO 
today, as is indeed reflected in the guiding documents. The 
principal and sole feature of the operation of Ground Troops' 
Aviation in accordance with them is "the organization of flights 
of solitary or small groups of helicopters away from their 
permanent basing."[.sup]1[/] 
  The ways of resolving the problems of aviation engineering 
support that arise are thus sought within the standard 
organizational structure of Ground Troops Aviation. Here is an 
example: "The preparation of helicopters in group basing away 
from the main airfield is accomplished by the technical crews 
with the involvement of members of the flight crew," the 
corresponding manual states. "The regular maintenance and repair 
operations on helicopters that are away from their primary base 
airfield may be performed by a mobile (air-mobile) TECh 
[Technical-Maintenance Unit] or PARM [Mobile Aircraft Repair 
Shop], with the involvement of the crew.[.sup]2[/] 
  Significant changes have occurred in recent years in both 
the 
helicopter hardware and the conditions for its application, 
while the structure of the system of IAO, combat preparation and 
combat operations in Ground Troops' Aviation has effectively not 
changed. The discrepancies between the ever-increasing 
requirements made toward Ground Troops' Aviation, the 
considerable changes in the conditions for its employment and 
the capabilities of the "old" IAO system were demonstrated 
especially visibly by the armed conflict in Afghanistan. Quite a 
few examples could be cited, at the same time, of the mutual 
integration of the technical and rear support for Ground Troops' 
Aviation and combined-arms formations, where entire helicopter 
squadrons operated for a long time together with units and 
formations of the ground forces as a unified, integral organism. 
A group of helicopters (6 Mi-8, 8 Mi-24, 2 Mi-6 and one Mi-10 
and Mi-9), for example, supported units and subunits of a 
motorized-rifle division and an assault brigade in the 
Feyzabad--Taloqan--Qonduz--Sar-e Pol--Mazar-e Sharif--Meymaneh 
area for two months in June--August of 1980. The group, carrying 
out raiding operations, was constantly in motion--basing in one 
place did not exceed two, or more rarely three, days. The IAS 
[aviation engineer service] group was at just 70 percent 
personnel strength. 
  The subunits for technical and rear support were operating 
together under these conditions. The "ground" people prepared 
the basing sites, provided security, defense and food, brought 
up ammunition and mat&eacute;riel, repaired the ordnance loads 
(BK) 
and reloaded the helicopter weaponry (ASP). Mixed crews were 
formed in practice, with an aviation mechanic for aviation 
weaponry and five or six people from the Ground Troops subunits 
engaged in reloading the ASP, for example. All of the manpower 
was thus thrown into the fastest possible preparation of the 
aviation hardware (AT). The ground servicing equipment moved in 
a unified column. 
  It is instructive that armored personnel carriers were the 
principal means of transport in a number of cases. They were 
used in particular for the delivery of ASP right to the 
helicopters. When a helicopter made a forced landing in a swamp 
in the area of the city of Feyzabad, it was an armored personnel 
carrier that pulled it out and towed it to the repair site. 
  Ground troops in general were the first to come to the aid 
of 
helicopters in forced landings in areas where ground forces were 
stationed, assisting them in every way they could, starting with 
defense and ending with direct participation in restoring the 
craft. There are lots of examples where both the crews and the 
aviation hardware were saved thanks to the timely assistance of 
the ground forces. 
  The improvement of IAO for ground forces aviation, in our 
opinion, entails a comprehensive review of all factors 
(conditions) that affect its organization, including of course 
specific features arising out of the operations of helicopters 
that are away from their main base locations. It should be taken 
into account therein that it exists within a system of overall 
technical support (TO) for the ground forces. 
  Analysis of the nature of combat operations by ground 
forces, 
and the role and place of helicopter units or subunits in them, 
makes it possible to ascertain several specific features of the 
employment of army aviation. First of all, ground forces 
aviation performs a unified combat mission in close interaction 
with combined-arms formations and units. Second, the great 
intensity of battle is a cause of the mass damaging or disabling 
of armaments and combat hardware (VVT), and the necessity of 
performing recovery and repair operations that are close in 
nature for most types of VVT (including aviation hardware) in a 
very short time. Third, the reliance of the enemy on firepower 
against troops in their full depth and the substantial 
disruptions of lines of communication lead to increased demands 
on the lower levels of the systems of technical support for the 
troops, and an increase in the role and significance of their 
interaction in isolated areas. Finally, the increased 
maneuvering capabilities of ground forces groupings makes it 
necessary to ensure the equal mobility of all of their elements. 
  Moreover, the results of research testify that the design 
and 
systems (type of operating body, parameters) are close for many 
models of aviation and armored hardware: Up to 24 percent of the 
entire body of aircraft weaponry and up to 70 percent of the GSM 
[oils and lubricants] employed on helicopters are also used in 
combined-arms units. The fasteners, technological methods, 
tooling and consumable materials are 60-80 percent similar for 
technical maintenance and repairs. The mobile 
technical-maintenance gear in service with the rear-support 
services of the ground forces may be used as much as 70 percent 
(for the types of work performed by the general-purpose 
ground-servicing for ground forces aviation), and the overhaul 
gear as much as 35 percent (for the types of work being 
performed by mobile ground forces aviation checkout and repair 
stations), for refueling and reloading operations and the 
overhaul of aircraft hardware. This value is close to 100 
percent for its recovery by ground transport. 
  Analysis of the conditions for the employment of ground 
forces aviation in contemporary battle thus testifies to the 
expediency of developing the system of technical maintenance for 
the ground forces in the direction of integrating the TO 
subsystems of the various branches, formulating uniform 
regulations (standards), and making joint use of some of the 
elements or facilities of the system of maintenance and repair. 
This system should include the elements (manpower and equipment) 
that performs general measures for the IAO of ground forces 
aviation and the TO of armored, engineer and motor vehicles, 
missiles, artillery and other types of VVT. The system of 
maintenance and repair of ground forces aviation hardware will 
thus include both the IAO elements of the combat entity itself 
(unit, subunit), and the common elements of the aforementioned 
system intended for the servicing and repair of AT. 
  The variation we are proposing for the system of maintenance 
and repair of ground forces aviation hardware is presented in 
the diagram. Its realization, in our opinion, would make it 
possible to increase the firepower of field forces by 8-10 
percent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-30A>           [Left:] Existing system of TO </FIG>





    We would note, in speaking of the integrated elements, that 
they include separate modules (repair and overhaul and recovery 
companies or battalions, the TEChs of brigades, VARMs [field 
aircraft repair shops] etc.). Some of them could be 
standardized, for example, for the performance of fitting, 
welding and soldering, dismantling and assembly, refueling and 
reloading, recovery, preparation and other operations, and 
another unit could specialize in individual types of VVT. The 
quantity of modules depends on the variation for the realization 
of the assigned combat task, and the requirements for work in 
recovery, salvage, overhaul and servicing of ground forces VVT. 
  Improvements in the structure of TO for ground forces 
aviation hardware, in our opinion, should proceed in three 
directions from a practical standpoint: Refueling and reloading, 
recovery and salvage, and field repair of AT. The creation of 
forward points for the replenishment of ammunition and fuel for 
helicopters would be expedient, in order to organize refueling 
and reloading operations and reduce the time to prepare for 
repeat sorties and the deployment of teams or crews for 
technical maintenance in forward areas from the main repair 
elements of the ground forces. The refueling of helicopters, 
tanks and other types of VVT could be performed by refueling 
helicopters, as well as the ground forces rear-support gear. 
  The dedicated purpose of the recovery companies and 
battalions must be expanded in order to organize the recovery 
and salvage of damaged AT, so that those units are able to 
recover all types of ground forces VVT, including aviation. 
Their composition would best include helicopters, and it makes 
sense to use the assault-transport helicopters in their 
interests. They could recover damaged hardware and bring it to 
the corresponding repair points when returning from forward 
areas. 
  The overall supervision of the organization of TO (sequence 
and procedure for maintenance, recovery and overhaul of 
hardware) is exercised by the apparatus of the deputy commander 
for weaponry. Technical supervision (determination of technical 
status and the overhaul of the aircraft and helicopters, among 
other things) is accomplished by the aviation specialists, using 
the manpower and equipment of the ground forces. 
  Domestic research has devoted a great deal of attention to 
experience in the organization of aviation engineer support in 
U.S. army aviation. IAO is performed there according to rules 
that take into account the specific conditions and requirements 
of the ground forces. The work on the technical servicing and 
repair (TER) is performed at three levels. The first includes 
the corresponding platoons of the battalion Ground Troops' 
Aviation. They perform field TER--all of preparation of aviation 
hardware for flights, as well as minor and routine repairs of 
assemblies. 
  The second level is the AT TER companies and battalions of 
the corps and divisions. They perform medium repairs, complex 
inspections and regular servicing operations. The third level is 
plant repair. It is performed in the continental United States 
by aircraft-repair facilities of the ground forces, other 
branches of the armed forces and civilian firms. 
  The IAS subunits that are performing intermediate TER are 
not 
part of the regular composition of the flight units, but are 
rather subordinate to the elements for technical and rear 
support of the divisions, corps and commands of the ground 
forces in a theater. They are the bulwark of the IAO of 
army-aviation units (the center of field repairs and technical 
servicing of aviation hardware in the areas where Ground Troops' 
Aviation units are stationed), and perform the principal repair 
and complex servicing operations, as well as allocating mobile 
teams to assist the field TER subunits. The subunits for 
intermediate TER are moreover the principal source of spare 
parts support for the flight units, from an exchange fund that 
is created from units and assemblies they have repaired. 
Analysis shows that the center of IAO operations is not in the 
flight units, but is rather in the subunits subordinate to the 
technical and rear-support elements of the ground forces. 
  The comprehensive utilization of the manpower and equipment 
of technical servicing could facilitate an increase in the 
efficiency of IAO for combat operations for ground forces 
aviation under our conditions. A standardization of both the 
models of VVT themselves and the means of servicing and 
repairing them, assurance of the preparedness of the ground 
forces personnel to perform operations on various types of VVT 
and the creation of a unified system for the administration, 
supply and training of personnel and VVT orders are all 
necessary for this to happen.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel V. Veselov, member, </F>
Scientific-Technical Committee, Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense Central Missile Fuels Directorate, under rubric 
"Official Section: Documents and Commentary": "Tank and 
Container Storage Periods for POL"] 
  [Text] It is difficult to overestimate the role of fuel 
quality control in ensuring reliable, long-lived, accident-free 
operation of Army and Navy arms and military equipment. Tank and 
container storage periods for POL are important starting points 
for such quality control. 
  The new "Instruktsiya po obespecheniyu kachestva goryuchego 
v 
VS RF" [Instruction for Quality Assurance of Fuel in the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces] attached even greater significance to 
these periods (shown in the table). Previous guidance documents 
envisaged three kinds of laboratory analysis: Check analysis, 
complete analysis and arbitrary analysis. Fuel stored within 
standard period limits will be subjected to depot analysis, 
which in terms of storage status plays the role of a complete 
analysis. A complete analysis will be performed for an in-depth 
study of quality at the expiration of periods and, of course, 
before putting a product up for lengthy storage as well as in a 
number of other cases.

1. Climatic areas of former USSR territory are specified by requirements of GOST 16350 "USSR Climate. Zoning 
and Statistical Parameters of Climatic Factors for Technical Purposes." 

2. POL storage conditions should conform to requirements of GOST 1510. 

3. Storage periods for POL not indicated in this table are determined according to its standard technical 
documentation. 


  Fuel storage periods also are reference points for drawing 
up 
a turnover plan. At the same time, except for aircraft fuel, it 
is not the expiration of periods, but a deterioration of quality 
indicators and their approach to admissible limiting values 
under GOST (TU) [State Standard (Technical Specifications)] that 
is the basis for turnover. 
  With the exception of aviation fuel, fuel storage periods 
may 
be extended one year if by the end of a period the fuel conforms 
to GOST (TU) requirements for all quality indicators to the 
extent of a complete analysis and has a quality margin for the 
indicators most inclined to change. At the expiration of the 
extended period, the storage period again may be extended for 
one year if the fuel has a quality margin based on data of a 
complete analysis. 
  Oils, lubricants and special fluids which have arrived in 
sealed and other airtight packaging (tubes, cans, bottles) may 
be stored and issued for use for arms and military equipment 
without analyses during the prescribed storage period based on a 
supplier plant's certificates. 
  Quality alone, not storage periods, is taken into account in 
deciding questions of using fuel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major-General Petr Karpyuk, chief, Central </F>
Directorate of Military Construction Units, by NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Kuznetsov: "Military Construction 
Troops Reorganizing; Contract Service, Separate Quarters on 
Way"; date and place not given; first paragraph is NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA introduction] 
  [Text] In December of 1993, President Yeltsin signed 
the Decree on reorganization of Military Units," which pertains 
to military constructions units of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Atomic Energy. Following is the text of an interview 
granted a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent on the subject of 
military construction troops by Major-General Petr Karpyuk, 
chief, Central Directorate of Military Construction Units, 
Ministry of Atomic Energy of Russia. 
  [Kuznetsov] What is the purpose behind the reorganization of 
the military construction troops? 
  [Karpyuk] In effect, the reorganization signifies a change 
to 
contract service. Our units will be among the first to be 
affected. The Army has acquired little experience in contract 
service so far, and it is always difficult to be the first. 
  Contract service presupposes an interest in service not only 
in the financial aspect, but in living conditions as well. The 
contract should specify how long the serviceman will be billeted 
on the barracks basis and when he will be assigned his own 
housing. Our plans make provision for moving soldiers out of 
barracks and placing them into separate quarters, with enhanced 
personal comfort and recreation conditions. 
  The reorganization should effect a change in the very nature 
in which military construction subunits are organized. Inductees 
will be able to acquire basic specialties by attending 
vocational and technical schools in military construction units. 
The decree calls for our completing the reorganization by the 
end of 1999, but we believe that we can accomplish it earlier. 
  [Kuznetsov] Military construction subunits participated in 
rebuilding the White House. Has that work been completed? 
  [Karpyuk] We were assigned the mission of cleaning up the 
11th and 18th floors. The 11th floor was in a relatively normal 
condition, but everything on the 18th floor was in a state of 
ruin -- the floor, walls, window openings. We had to set up 
three shifts. One thing the soldiers had to do was form a line 
on the stairs and manually pass down polyethylene bags 
containing the debris. The assigned mission was accomplished on 
time, for which all enlisted men, officers, and warrant officers 
taking part in the work were commended. We came out with the 
initiative of performing the repairs proper on the floors, using 
our own personnel, but we unfortunately were not given that 
opportunity; foreign firms were engaged to make the repairs. 
  We have something of which we can be proud. The military 
construction units in all cases performed their work in an 
exemplary manner, regardless of where they were assigned. That 
was true for Chernobyl, Armenia, Arzamas, Sverdlovsk, etc. There 
may have been danger in Chernobyl, but in Armenia it was simply 
terrible. They worked under most difficult conditions, living in 
tents. Our units were the only ones to complete their mission 
there on time by preparing all the trouble sites. I consider 
that we did our duty with honor. 
  [Kuznetsov] What is the greatest difficulty you are 
presently 
facing? 
  [Karpyuk] One of our principal problems, the same as that 
plaguing many ministry enterprises, is the financial. The 
government at one time handed down an instruction requiring that 
additional compensation be paid, with funds taken out of 
construction profits. It must be realized that the legislation 
was a mistake. The financial situation is such that customers 
became indebted to us in the amount of about one billion rubles. 
However, soldiers have no interest, nor should they have, in our 
financial problems. The leadership of military construction 
units did all it could so that the soldiers would be paid 
individually for they money they earned. As an example, the 
average pay of soldiers in the Urals area as of the end of the 
year was approximately 120,000 rubles, while the average amount 
for Russia was 80,000 to 90,000 rubles. 
  [Kuznetsov] I know that the manpower of the military 
construction units has undergone a reduction. Have you been able 
to retain the cadre? 
  [Karpyuk] We have taken all measures to retain our 
specialists - our backbone, and I believe that in this we have 
been successful. It is necessary to avoid making hasty 
decisions, of course. V. Mikhaylov, the Russian Minister of 
Atomic Energy, signed an agreement with the head of the Voronezh 
Oblast administration dealing with construction of the second 
section of the Novovoronezh AES [Atomic Energy Station], but, 
several days prior to that event, our unit stationed in 
Novovoronezh was disbanded. 
  [Kuznetsov] How is the call-up coming along? People are 
presently unwilling to enter the service. 
  [Karpyuk] As far as the conscription process is concerned, 
we 
are suffering a shortfall, the same as the rest of the Army. 
However, in this area we are receiving support from the 
Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Moscow and of other regions. 
They have spent some time visiting several of our units - in 
Elektrostal, Protvino, and other locations, and while there saw 
for themselves the high level of our officer cadre and the 
latter's understanding of the problems facing young soldiers and 
their proper approach to the organization of service and 
leisure. The Committee is supporting us in nurturing work and is 
helping obtain access to theaters and museums. Set up in each of 
our units is a dispensary for treating youths in poor health by 
dispensing to the latter healthful diets. 
  The number of criminal offenses committed in military 
construction subunits of the MINATOM [Ministry of Atomic Energy] 
of Russia dropped by more than half in the past year, and this 
includes the area of nonregulation interpersonal conduct, and, 
in the case of hooliganism, incidents are down by a factor 
greater than 5. I believe that the Committee of Solders' Mothers 
plays a definite role in crime abatement. 
  And so, if any draftee wishes to acquire a civilian job 
skill 
while in the service, he should request assignment to a military 
construction unit of the MINATOM of Russia. We will be happy to 
take him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lietenant-General Ivan Mikhaylovich Chizh, </F>
Chief of Medical Services of the Armed Forces of the Russian 
Federation, by Petr Altunin; place and date not given: "Good 
Health to the Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] Visitor's Card: Ivan Mikhaylovich Chizh 
  He was born in the village of Shilinok in the Berezovsk 
rayon of the Brest oblast. He graduated from the military 
medicine department of the Kuybyshev Medical Institute in 1972, 
and in 1981 from the department of supervisor personnel of the 
Military Medical Academy. In 1987 he became the Chief of Medical 
Service of the Turkestan Military District. In 1991 he was 
appointed the First Deputy Chief, and in October 1993 the Chief 
of the Main Military Medical Directorate of the Ministry of 
Defense, the Chief of Medical Service of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation. He is a Lieutenant-General of Medical 
Service. 
  He is married, with a son who is a student at the 
Military Medical Academy, and a daughter in college. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, you were the number two man in 
the medical service of the Armed Forces for more than two years, 
and now you are number one. You undoubtedly have a good idea of 
what our health care is like today, and in particular are well 
acquainted with the status of medical support in the Army and 
Navy. The newspaper assertions which have become commonplace 
recently, that our health is worsening -- are they justified? 
  [Chizh] As far as the country goes, the reduction in the 
living standards of the populace, and in particular the 
worsening in the quality of food, and the lack of social 
protection of large groups of people, especially retirees and 
disabled persons, result in the many negative consequences which 
the papers write about. 
  I must say that in the Army and Navy, the medical indices in 
all basic parameters are comparatively good. Thanks to 
discipline, good organization of personnel, and the high 
qualifications and devotion to duty of military medics in the 
units and on the ships, epidemiological measures are active and 
persistent, and there is strict monitoring of working conditions 
in the Army. 
  [Altunin] Tell me, is the manpower adequate for this? 
Haven't 
you been affected by the reduction in the Armed Forces? 
  [Chizh] The general situation is not a simple one, of 
course, 
and it also affects the status of military medicine. But the Law 
"On the Status of Service Members" and subsequent orders of the 
minister of defense, which raised it to a qualitatively new 
level in the Armed Forces, have entailed not a reduction in 
personnel, but on the contrary, reinforcement of our 
institutions. 
  After all, what were things like before this? We had 
"active" 
service members, as well as generals and senior reserve and 
retired officers who had served 25 years in the Army, receiving 
medical services. But now the contract troops and their families 
are added to that, and also reserve and retired officers, 
including junior ones, discharged with 20 years or more of 
service, and their families. If you count the women and children 
in the garrisons, and the blue and white-collar workers whom we 
also serve, this amounts to around 5 million people. Imagine how 
many medical personnel are needed today! 
  [Altunin] As you see it, what are the reasons for this? 
  [Chizh] There are several. Some are common to all officers, 
particularly the poor living conditions, and for military 
doctors, especially the scarce specialists, there is the 
temptation of finding work in commercial structures. In recent 
years the number of those wanting to continue their training in 
military medical departments has also dropped significantly. 
  [Altunin] So what are you doing? 
  [Chizh] I must say that the package of military laws adopted 
recently, which have somewhat raised the prestige of military 
service, have played their part. But we are doing some things. A 
system of post-graduate physician training has been created, 
including primary specialization, along with systematic 
improvement of medical personnel. Besides this, a significant 
number of physicians have the chance to study in the department 
of supervisor personnel and in clinical residencies. 
  Further, we have begun to successfully recruit women to the 
departments. Incidentally, at present they make up about 5 
percent of medical service officers, and according to 
predictions by the year 2000 they will be 10 to 15 percent of 
the total number. Since last year we have also begun recruiting 
reserve medical service officers on a contract basis. 
  [Altunin] So things have worked out with respect to cadres. 
But where will they serve the doubled contingent of patients, 
these 5 million? After all, you can't spread apart the walls of 
the hospitals and polyclinics, and they aren't building new ones. 
  [Chizh] No, but why must we? They are putting up new 
buildings at the hospitals, even if it is slow, and bed space is 
growing overall. Besides that, we are working actively to expand 
and reconstruct old and so-called adapted premises. In addition, 
a territorial system of medical service is being created. Small 
institutions of different services and combat arms close to one 
another are being combined into base hospitals and polyclinics. 
  The hospitals include specialized departments and offices, 
including vascular surgery, oncology, endoscopy, "artificial 
kidney," ultrasound and others. We are converting polyclinics 
into consulting and diagnostic centers with the corresponding 
reinforcement with qualified specialists and equipment. 
  The 45 Central Polyclinics of the Defense Ministry can serve 
as an example. [A polyclinic] includes 18 treatment and 
diagnostic departments, 12 offices, and an infection/immunology 
laboratory. Last year around 30 thousand patients received 
consultations there. Many of them were provided the necessary 
assistance on the spot, during admittance, using various modern 
methods of examination. Day inpatient facilities are a new and 
undoubtedly progressive type of operation of military 
polyclinics. What are they? After initial reception at the 
office of the physician/therapist or surgeon, the officer is 
sent to the inpatient facility of the polyclinic, where he 
undergoes a complete examination from all the specialists 
involved with his ailment without changing his "life-style." A 
300-bed hospital could not have accommodated the patients who 
have gone through "day inpatient" facilities in the last three 
years. This means convenience for the service members and the 
families, and in itself brings a savings of resources. 
  [Altunin] But we often get letters to the editors from 
military retirees and even cadre officers that there is a long 
waiting list for hospitalization. 
  [Chizh] Yes, this is true, especially in Moscow there are 
still not enough places. Of course it is not a matter of urgent 
assistance. There are no problems with that. This has to do with 
planned treatments. But I already mentioned above that this 
problem is being resolved. Of course, as before we give priority 
to war veterans and disabled veterans and their equivalent 
categories. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, letters of another type also 
come to the editors, from service members and members of their 
families suffering from grave illnesses. They persistently 
request that they be sent abroad for treatment. What do you say 
to this? 
  [Chizh] We get such letters at the GVMU [Main Military 
Medical Directorate] too. As a human being I can understand 
these people. Something terrible happens and you start rushing 
about. Only, I must say that recently the capabilities of our 
military treating facilities have grown significantly. For 
example, at the Main Hospital imeni N.N. Burdenko, they have 
done more than a hundred kidney transplants, are performing 
unique cardiac operations and laparoscopic surgery (without 
cutting into the abdominal cavity), and at the Central Hospital 
imeni A.A. Vishnevskiy, they are successfully doing aortal 
coronary bypasses for ischemic disease, and implanting 
pacemakers for cardiac arrhythmias. At the Military Medical 
Academy they are transplanting bone marrow to patients with 
oncological blood diseases. In treatment practice, the latest 
attainments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, microsurgery and 
others are being used more and more. 
  As for trips abroad for treatment, that is a very individual 
matter. But the corresponding expense item was not provided for 
in the estimate of expenditures in the Defense Ministry. I know 
there are very limited capabilities in the Ministry of Health of 
the Russian Federation. 
  [Altunin] Afghanistan, where you saw both blood and death, 
and directly organized medical support, and also the Chernobyl 
accident, the earthquake in Armenia, and "hot spots" in 
different regions of the country, has all of this "shaken up" 
our military medicine? Has it forced some changes? 
  [Chizh] Our medicine has enormous experience from the Great 
Patriotic War, and we continue to study and utilize it. 
Nonetheless, the recent events which you mentioned have forced 
us to revise much, and to put the accent on military field 
surgery. The basic conclusion was to create an emergency medical 
service. Besides the center, it calls for special-purpose 
medical detachments in the Armed Services and districts and also 
for a number of non-organic formations in military hospitals. 
There is precedence: In the Hospital imeni Burdenko they have 
already created "flying laboratories." When the situation 
requires it, a group of doctors and nurses will head for "hot 
spots" in a small special aircraft to provide rapid and 
effective assistance to the injured. This year five medical 
"special-purpose elements" will be organized. All of this within 
the general doctrine of assuring a high level of combat 
readiness for actions in extreme situations. 
  [Altunin] About emergency situations, Ivan Mikhaylovich. Did 
you notice that there were two military medics among the ten 
people named by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA in its "Exploit-93"? 
  [Chizh] How could I not? Thank you. Extracting a mine fuze 
from the body of a Georgian lad, which in the course of the 
surgery might cost the life of the surgeon himself, Colonel 
Shurenkov, that is of course an exploit. But I must say that 
nowadays such selflessness in military medics is more the rule 
than the exception. For example, the medical chief of the 201st 
Division, Lietenant-Colonel Valeriy Sergeyevich Arutyunov, 
during an attack on the 12th Element of the Moscow Border 
Detachment himself personally rushed in on an APC and while 
under fire from the Mujaheddin provided assistance to the 
wounded, and carried them from the battlefield. And a 
just-recent incident: The chief surgeon of the Armed Forces, 
Major-General of Medical Service Pavel Georgiyevich Bryusov was 
at the operating table for nine hours, removing the trachea and 
simultaneously the esophagus of an oncological patient, and then 
restoring them with prostheses. 
  [Altunin] A few words about medical supplies. 
  [Chizh] You know what the general supply background is in 
the 
country. The basic problems come from a shortage of financing. 
Nonetheless, with the support of the Defense Ministry and with 
the assistance of the Ministry of Health and our own 
initiatives, I can state firmly that we have managed to maintain 
the treatment-and-prevention institutions at a level which 
allows them to fully provide all types of medical assistance. We 
have signed more than 600 contracts in the amount of 20.8 
billion rubles for delivery of 7 thousand items of medical 
technical equipment and gear from 700 enterprises and 
joint-stock companies. 
  We are also given hard currency to buy imported equipment, 
but very little. But I want to say that we have now organized 
the production of many nationally-produced medications and 
instruments which are equal to the foreign analogues, or even 
surpass them. This includes, for example, ultrasound units, 
lithotripsy devices, gammascopic units and much else. 
  [Altunin] We know that for the time being article 16 of the 
Law "On the Status of Service Members" is "not working." 
  [Chizh] Some provisions, having to do with medical support 
of 
all service members and their families are already working, as I 
mentioned earlier. As for the payment of monetary compensation 
in the amount of the average cost of travel, that we don't have. 
A draft statute "On Procedures for Compensation of Expenses 
Associated With Provision of Medical Assistance, Sanatorium and 
Spa Treatment, and Organized Rest of Service Members, Civilians 
Discharged From Military Service, and Members of Their Families, 
as Well as Payment of Monetary Compensation for Treatment" has 
been sent to the government. Unfortunately, the adoption of this 
statute is being delayed due to the lack of financial resources. 
  I should add that since many military health resorts "went" 
to the CIS countries, and particularly to Ukraine, we are 
expanding the spa system in Russia. New buildings are springing 
up in the Moscow region and in the Stavropol and Krasnodar 
krays, and last year's plan was met. In addition we have 
acquired ("ransomed") from other ministries a number of 
sanatoria which were becoming run-down. This "deal" was made by 
the Airborne Troops, the Transbaykal Military District, and the 
Space Troops. Talks are under way with Ukraine regarding joint 
use of the Black Sea military health resorts. 
  [Altunin] Ivan Mikhaylovich, the last word: How do you 
yourself, a doctor, set an example in improving health? 
  [Chizh] For now I get along without medicine. I love 
volleyball and skiing. I have to say that recently because I 
have neglected these "procedures" because I have been so busy, 
and have limited myself to intensive morning exercise. I think 
that when I get into the new routine, I will make up for it.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Panfilov under the rubric "Tajikistan": </F>
"The Opposition Demands Talks: The Government of Tajikistan and 
the Russian Military Are Discussing an Armistice"] 
  [Text] Several meetings were held in Moscow during the past 
week between officials of Tajikistan and the command element of 
the CIS peacekeeping forces in that republic and members of the 
directorate of the Coordinating Center for Democratic Forces in 
the CIS countries. The so-called political opposition was 
represented by the democratically oriented intelligentsia forced 
out of Tajikistan and also by the leadership of political 
parties and movements officially banned by the Dushanbe regime. 
  Naturally, the main thrust of armed opposition forces 
penetrating across the Afghan-Tajik border is received by 
Russian troops, and the concern of their command element is 
apparent. The latest interviews given by Colonel-General Boris 
Pyankov, the commander, remind one more of a show of force than 
concern that peace and agreement are hardly possible without a 
political settlement of the situation. Nonetheless, in two 
meetings with members of the Coordinating Center in Moscow on 14 
and 16 February Boris Pyankov attempted to get the moderate 
opposition to reject the "formation of bands" in Afghanistan, 
probably with a view to splitting up the entire opposition and 
shifting all of the blame for the conflict onto armed refugees 
in the neighboring country. The conclusions drawn by the 
Coordinating Center are that they consider the beginning of 
talks to be the main problem. These conclusions were ultimately 
accepted, but how seriously they will be regarded will become 
clear only after Pyankov has told the same thing to Imamali 
Rakhmanov, Tajikistan's leader. Neither Rakhmonov nor anyone 
else from among the Tajik officials has yet voiced support for 
holding talks with the opposition, however. The first documents 
have been joint proposals submitted to the Russian government, 
the presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and the foreign 
ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as 
well as Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon, representative of the UN 
secretary general, by the Coordinating Center, the Council for 
the Resistance in Afghanistan and the Democratic Party. The 
ambassador has already given his agreement to facilitate the 
talks. There has still been no official response from 
Tajikistan, however, with the exception of an interview given 
the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA by Imamali Rakhmanov in which he 
continues to divide citizens of the country he heads into good 
and bad. 
  On the other hand, delegations from Dushanbe began arriving 
in Moscow to meet with the refugees and convince them to return. 
The first trip, by Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet, at the end of last year ended in failure. In his 
interview on Tajik television, however, he depicted it as an 
achievement. His second trip to Moscow, made on 15 February, was 
also unsuccessful. Neither the Coordinating Center nor the 
Foundation for Aiding Refugees agreed to discuss anything with 
Koimdodov, but this time a MAYAK correspondent sent out a report 
on the delegation's successes from Dushanbe. "This can be called 
nothing other than a provocation," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent was told by Otakhon Latifi, head of the center, 
and Khabib Sanginov, chairman of the foundation. Furthermore, 
they do not believe that the delegation was empowered by the 
republic's Supreme Soviet to conduct any kind of talks. 
  Be that as it may, it appears that Dushanbe is attempting to 
gain time, and Russian troops are paying for that. Most likely, 
after the Ramadan fast, the conflicts in Tajikistan will flare 
up with new force. According to the Russian military, however, 
they will occur not on the border but inside the republic. It is 
not clear at this time how the military themselves will react to 
these proposals. It is known, however, that coalition forces are 
planning to conduct exercises, and an additional contingent will 
be sent to Tajikistan. 
  The actions of the Tajik authorities and the Russian 
military 
can be explained by their fear of a dangerous escalation. This 
was probably not a coincidence, but General Boris Pyankov, Prime 
Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov, Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Mecheslav Senkevich, the 
Russian Federation's ambassador to Tajikistan, (known for having 
provided diplomatic support for armed detachments of the former 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Safarali Kendzhayev, in the 
capture of Dushanbe), all found themselves in Moscow at the same 
time.

Colonel Yevgeniy Sigutkin, under the rubric: "A Scholar's 
Opinion": "Highly Mobile, Well Equipped -- On the Question of 
the Development of the Ukrainian Ground Troops' (Ground Defense 
Troops (GDT)) Organizational Development Concept"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Ground Troops Organizational 
Development Concept is a definite system of views on the conduct 
of Ground Troops military (combat) operations and their 
organization at the current or at a definite stage of Ukrainian 
Armed Forces organizational development. That is, the concept 
must be developed in a definite period because various points of 
view on Armed Forces organizational development exist in 
military theory, military plans change and searches are being 
conducted for new solutions to military organizational 
development issues. 
  The concept must define the goals, missions, primary 
direction and stages of the organizational development and 
formation of the Ground Troops (GDT) under new, radically 
changing conditions in accordance with the state's new missions 
and capabilities. To do this, we need to characterize the new 
conditions, missions and the capabilities of the state that have 
developed for the creation of the Ground Troops (GDT). 
  The experience of the transformations in the Soviet Army of 
the 1950's --beginning of the 1960's was not entirely 
successful, especially in the methods of conducting large-scale 
troop reductions and changes to the structure of the command and 
control elements. While resolving the issues of Ground Troops 
(GDT) organizational development at the current stage, we need 
to take into account the fundamental changes in the world 
community's interstate relations and also an examination of the 
assessments of threats to stability in the world and Ukraine's 
national interests, views on possible causes of military 
conflicts and the nature of the conduct of armed combat, and the 
content of armed forces operations in wars and military 
conflicts of varying intensity. 
  We need to conduct an assessment of the content and nature 
of 
modern operations to determine the primary missions of the 
Ground Troops. Research and experience permit us to say that 
modern Ground Troops operations must be carried out in the form 
of air-ground combat operations and must be mobile in nature. 
The "relative importance" of a breakthrough of a rigid defense 
that has been prepared beforehand will be reduced in modern 
operations, line and position types of combat operations, 
employment of unwieldy tank and mechanized formations, and the 
stability of fronts will lose their meaning because the 
destruction of troop formations that have selected position 
types of combat operations on prepared defensive lines will be 
achieved through long-range electronic and fire pressure. 
  The primary missions of the Ground Troops (GDT) will consist 
of the following: 
  In peacetime -- 

  -  maintenance of high combat and mobilization readiness of 
the command and control elements, formations, units and 
institutions; 
  -  ensuring the guaranteed transition of troops from 
a peacetime to a wartime footing with the goal of accomplishing 
missions to repel enemy aggression in coordination with the 
formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' support 
services; 
  -  steady, purposeful training of command and control 
elements and troops to accomplish missions in accordance with 
their tasking designation; 
  -  conduct of the call-up of citizens 
for training assemblies and the build up of a trained military 
reserve; 
  -  equipping the troops with modern systems, military 
equipment and materiel; 
  -  participation in the fulfillment of 
Ukraine's obligations to maintain peace and stability in various 
regions; 
  -  and, rendering assistance to the population while 
eliminating the aftereffects of technological and economic 
catastrophes and natural disasters. 

    In wartime: 

  -  accomplishment of missions based upon the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces strategic deployment plan, implementation of measures and 
the conduct of combat operations to localize (end) armed 
conflicts, repelling aggression using permanent readiness troops 
(covering formations) that are deployed in strategic areas in 
peacetime and, when necessary -- using mobilized troop 
formations; 
  -  the conduct of joint, with formations of the various 
branches of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, defensive and 
counteroffensaive operations to defeat an 
aggressor; 
  -  participation in repelling an aerospace attack, the 
conduct of airborne assault and other joint operations of the 
various branches of the Armed Forces; 
  -  participation in 
preventing attempts to commit terrorist acts against 
strategically important targets; 
  -  the formation, training and 
transport of strategic reserves based upon tasking designation, 
and the replacement of personnel, arms and military equipment 
losses. 

    The primary goal, direction and missions of Ukrainian Armed 
Forces organizational development is determined based upon an 
analysis of the nature, conditions of conduct and the content of 
modern operations and missions which the Armed Forces must be 
prepared to accomplish. 
  The following must be the primary missions of Ground Troops' 
organizational development: 

  -  the maintenance and restoration of the combat potential of 
Ground Troops formations, their infrastructure, command and 
control and communications system on the territory of 
Ukraine; 
  -  bringing the strength and combat composition of the 
Armed Forces into accord with the established quotas, level and 
nature of the missions assigned to them; 
  -  ensuring an increase of 
the professional level of the military cadre and of all 
personnel; 
  -  a transition to a mixed troop manning system; and, 
improvement of the support and command and control system. 

    We need to realize Ground Troops organizational development 
and reform missions consistently, in accordance with the classic 
principle, in three stages. 
  The first stage -- Ground Troops organizational 
development has primarily been completed at the present time. 
  The second stage must provide for the creation of 
the preconditions for profound transformations in the Ground 
Troops and the conduct of research on the substantiation of 
their strength, combat composition and structure. 
  The third stage -- This is the transformation of 
the structure of the branches of the armed forces and special 
troops, the system of command and control elements, manning and 
training of military cadres and troops, and the initiation of 
reequipping with new weapons systems and military equipment. 
  While resolving the Ground Troops' organizational 
development 
and reform missions, naturally, the need will arise to resolve a 
number of problems. This is also the problem of the composition 
of formations and troop deployments, improvement of the Ground 
Troops organizational structure, development of modern 
facilities and the troop mobilized deployment structure and 
training of reserves, and a fundamental review of troop manning 
principles and the troop manning system. 
  Ground Troops' organizational development and reform is 
large-scale work. Realization of the Ground Troops' 
organizational development and reform missions will permit us to 
impart to them a qualitatively new appearance that meets modern 
requirements.

Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya: "Officers Have to Set an 
Example"] 
  [Text] Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
and First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine 
Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Lopata visited units of the 14th Air 
Army during the end-of-training-period performance 
evaluation. 
  A commission headed by Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, as 
has already been reported, conducted a performance evaluation in 
military units of the 14th Air Army. The head of the committee 
visited several aviation garrisons, became familiarized with the 
state of affairs, met with servicemen there and answered a host 
of their questions. 
  The officers of army command were interested first and 
foremost in what the structures of the Air Forces will be in the 
future. It was indicated in reply that the amount of aviation on 
the territory of Ukraine (and this conforms to international 
treaties) is considerably less than is needed for three air 
armies. There will thus certainly be no need to maintain three 
army staffs in the future. 
  A new branch of the armed forces--the Air Defense Troops--is 
also being created. The Air Forces and the Air-Defense Troops 
will be part of them. This will cause changes in administrative 
structures as well. But all of the reforms will take place after 
diligent study, analysis and substantiation, and without any 
haste whatsoever. 
  The problem of providing flight personnel for the 
units--especially helicopter units--is a quite acute one in the 
air army, since they are trained in Russia. How will this 
problem be resolved? 
  We are not refusing any officers today, including pilots, 
who 
express the desire to move from Russia and serve in Ukraine, 
stated Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata in reply. And they are 
coming to serve. But not as many as are needed. At the same 
time, we are not keeping anyone here by force. All of those who 
wish to do so can move to Russia. The fact that they do not want 
very much to accept them there is another matter. We will solve 
the problem of training pilots using our own resources. We have 
already accepted into the Military Aviation Academy, this year, 
enough cadets to train for all branches of aviation. 
Difficulties are inevitable until they are trained. All pilots 
who intend to continue their service must thus be given the 
opportunity to do so. 
  The shortage of housing is probably problem number one for 
all garrisons, including the air garrisons. 
  We had to build twenty-eight thousand apartments this year, 
indicated the chief of the Main Staff. The corresponding funding 
was allocated for it. The state was counting on the fact that 
some military property would be sold abroad, and that most of 
the funds received would be directed toward housing 
construction. We were not able to build that quantity of 
apartments in just a year, however, because all of those funds 
were subject to inflation and were devalued considerably. We can 
count on only half that amount. A program to provide servicemen 
with housing in the future has already been worked out. It 
envisages the receipt of funds from other sources. It is also 
permissible to find and encourage investors on the following 
terms: Anyone can build housing on the land of the military 
department, including foreign structures, but only provided that 
thirty percent of the apartments will belong to them, and the 
rest to us. 
  There is another way out of the housing problem as 
well--individual construction by servicemen. But there are still 
no funds for that. The state has not even allocated funds to 
grant the loans stipulated by the corresponding legislation. The 
solution of the housing problem is thus made more difficult by 
the lack of funds. Housing will appear in the future, when the 
financing is arranged. The "first in line" people--those who are 
being discharged--will be provided with apartments in the first 
two years, and all the rest in five years. Those calculations 
are based on the actual capabilities of our state. 
  The absence of funds is also complicating the payment for 
municipal services by military units. How can this situation be 
rectified? 
  Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata replied that if there is 
nothing with which to pay, then do not pay. There is good 
precedent for this in Poltava Oblast. There the local 
administration decided to cancel all of the indebtedness of the 
military units for heat and electric power. A billion 
karbovantsi were also allocated for interest-free loans to do 
preparatory work to erect housing next year for servicemen. They 
also allocated half a billion karbovantsi so as to pay the 
officers and warrant officers in a timely manner, since the 
financing was delayed at the center. All of this testifies to 
the fact that the officials in Poltava understand very well that 
without the support of the local authorities, it is too 
difficult for our state to maintain the armed forces today. This 
should also be understood in other oblasts as well, and they 
should meet the servicemen halfway. 
  A question was also posed regarding to whom the helicopter 
units will be subordinate. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata 
answered that all of us in the "infantry" have a great deal of 
respect for the fliers. We thus feel that army aviation should 
be part of the ground forces and be part of the structures of 
the districts, corps and divisions. 
  The helicopter units are subordinate to the air armies 
today. 
Why was that decision made? Only because that could provide for 
at least a minimal level of training during these difficult 
times for us. 
  The fliers also posed the question of improving the supply 
of 
military clothing, and especially special types. 
  It was indicated in reply that the President has already 
approved new models for military dress. It is, to put it thus, 
pretty good, no worse than in Russia. Its production is based 
entirely on the industry of Ukraine. We will do everything to 
see that the necessary quantity of dress, footwear and 
everything else is manufactured, and we will supply it to the 
troops in the necessary quantities. 
  We are issuing coveralls like those for tank crews to the 
aircraft ground-support specialists today, so as to get out of 
the current situation. We have ordered flight suits from Russia 
for the pilots. There will be no problems with the supply of 
mat&eacute;riel in the future. 
  Many pilots were uneasy about how they will preserve their 
proficiency ratings, since in the absence of fuel they are not 
meeting the norms for flying time. 
  We obtain all the fuel for aviation, it was stated in reply, 
from Azerbaijan on a barter basis. 
  There is fuel in Ukraine as well, but funds are needed to 
pay 
for it. The financing for the Ministry of Defense, however, is 
unsteady; funds are even lacking for timely pay, whence many 
misfortunes. We hope things will be better in the coming year. 
This year we have resorted to reducing the requirements for the 
number of hours of flying time for all categories of flight 
personnel, so as not to deprive them of their existing 
proficiency ratings. We are approaching this problem in 
considered fashion, and no pilot will be deprived of his rights 
or privileges. 
  Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, in concluding the meeting, 
transmitted the request of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
that all officers make an example of themselves, and approach 
the resolution of problems connected with the building of our 
armed forces in considered fashion. All problems can be 
resolved, he indicated, for which purpose we must forget about 
discord; only unity can hold sway in officers' circles. We must 
preserve our respect for each other, and at the same time raise 
our mutual exactingness in the performance of official duties.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA commentator Senior Lieutenant </F>
Serhiy Zhurets: "`They've STARTed'--But It's Still a Long Way to 
the Non-Nuclear Finish Line"] 
  [Text] There is certainly no other topic to which 
politicians, diplomats and especially the mass media, both at 
home and outside the borders of our country, have devoted as 
much attention. It is a worthwhile topic: A closed session of 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine voted 254 in favor and nine 
against to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known 
among specialists as SNO-1 and christened by journalists as 
START. Ukraine, in accordance with this START, will cut back 36 
percent of the overall number of missiles and 42 percent of the 
nuclear warheads. So the Ukrainian parliament has taken the 
first step toward common sense, contrary to which these terrible 
weapons were built, placed and serviced on our Ukrainian soil 
for many long decades. 
  A press conference was also devoted to the ratification of 
START-1 by the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, with the participation 
of Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Vasyl Durdynets, 
Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Defense and State 
Security Chairman Valentyn Lemish, Vice Prime-Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov, Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko. 
  Deputy Vasyl Durdynets indicated that the decision made to 
ratify START was preceded by an almost year-long review and 
diligent collective analysis of possible military-political, 
economic, ecological and social consequences of the fulfillment 
of this treaty by our state, a treaty that took shape at one 
time without the participation of Ukraine. And they approached 
this important decision both with the noble intention of our 
country to be a non-nuclear state in the future, and with the 
idea of the inviolability of our borders and a regard for other 
national interests. The deputies addressed their principal 
attention in the course of discussion toward such serious 
factors as the role of nuclear weapons as a factor of restraint, 
the economic capabilities of our state to meet to the full the 
obligations that arise from the treaty, and the capabilities for 
ensuring ecological and nuclear security during the cutback and 
elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  I would especially like to emphasize, said Vasyl Vasylovych, 
that in the context of the decision made the attitude of the 
Supreme Soviet and the leadership of Ukraine toward the future 
non-nuclear status of our state has not changed. We have hoped 
and tried in our activity to convince the international 
community, and first of all the nuclear and other influential 
states of the world, of the necessity of reciprocal steps on 
their part with regard to granting Ukraine solid guarantees of 
security, the receipt of adequate financial assistance for the 
reduction of these weapons and compensation for the nuclear 
warheads, including tactical ones. 
  Times are such today, however, that it does not pay to be an 
optimist. Kiev cherishes the hope that it is now the turn of 
Moscow and Washington to display trust. But as they say, trust 
in God, but... You know the rest. 
  So it is understandable why the decree of the Supreme Soviet 
of Ukraine ratifying START has thirteen stipulations, only after 
the fulfillment of which the treaty, or more precisely the whole 
great series of political, economic and military-technical 
components of this document, will begin to be realized. Here are 
just a few of them. 
  "Ukraine as a state possessing nuclear weapons is moving 
toward non-nuclear status, and will gradually get rid of the 
nuclear weapons deployed on its territory, provided it retains 
sound guarantees of its national security, in which the nuclear 
states assume the obligation never to employ conventional armed 
forces against it and will not resort to the threat of force, 
will respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the 
borders of Ukraine, and will refrain from economic pressure with 
the aim of resolving any disputed issues." 
  The current crisis state of the economy of Ukraine is taken 
into account among the other stipulations--the granting of 
sufficient international financial and technical assistance. 
  The leadership of Ukraine, by the way, has emphasized all of 
this repeatedly. But words remain words, and promises promises. 
And it is becoming more and more understandable that we will 
have to guarantee our own security and inviolability, first and 
foremost with our own resources. Even the signing of the 
framework agreement between Kiev and Washington, in accordance 
with which Ukraine could receive 175 million dollars (moreover 
not monetary, but rather in the form of specific programs and 
hardware purchased not at our prices, but at significantly 
higher world prices) does not fundamentally resolve the problem 
of finances. The 2.8 billion we need sometimes elicits only 
pessimistic smiles in the West. The attempts to conduct 
negotiations with Russia on receiving compensation for the 
tactical arms removed from Ukraine, about 5-6 billion dollars, 
are already reaching a dead end. 
  So who can we count on? The West? Russia? 
  Certainly, on ourselves first of all. The more so as 
Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov, answering a question on who should 
give us financial assistance, answered quite concretely, "No one 
should. None of us has the idea that someone will be coming to 
us with money, and we will start spending it. Although we do 
need assistance. And I hope that after the ratification of the 
treaty there will be a suitable attitude toward Ukraine as well." 
  Frankly speaking, by the way, may we be mistaken in counting 
on a suitable attitude toward Ukraine, as Valeriy Shmarov says, 
or in the words of Vasyl Durdynets, on reciprocal steps on the 
part of the nuclear powers? On the very same day that the 
Supreme Soviet ratified START, after all, the WASHINGTON POST 
wrote that the Ukrainian parliamentarians had put forth so many 
stipulations that the voting was more a political gambit than a 
final decision. That reaction is understandable; the conclusions 
and the results of the discussion by the Ukrainian 
parliamentarians affirmed in the document on the further fate of 
nuclear arms is not quite what they were counting on outside the 
borders of Ukraine. Thirty-six percent of the warheads, after 
all, is not 100 percent, as they wanted very much in Washington. 
And the seven years over which the cutbacks will take place are 
not the 24 months that the Russian delegation was seeking at the 
negotiations at Masandra. 
  It clearly suits neither Russia nor the West that our 
parliamentarians made the stipulation that Ukraine does not 
consider Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, ratified along with 
START and signed in the name of Ukraine on 31 June 1991, binding 
on it. That article states that "Ukraine is obligated to become 
a non-nuclear state as soon as possible, and to join the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty in that quality." 
  You will ask, is it really and truly just a matter of 
Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, as Kiev has already been hearing 
for a whole year, and not only from the Russian minister of 
foreign affairs? 
  No, it is not a case of ambitions. 
  First of all, Ukraine could not make a claim to the 
components of the nuclear arms as their property in the case of 
joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. All scientific and 
industrial activity in Ukraine that is associated with the atom 
would moreover become illegal today. And what then would happen 
to our power engineering, which today relies almost a third on 
AESs [nuclear electric-power plants]? 
  Second, the recent partners in the negotiations on nuclear 
arms are forgetting something that is already known and has been 
repeated more than once: "We can," feels Supreme Soviet Deputy 
Chairman Vasyl Durdynets, "provide for cutbacks and reductions 
only of that quantity of nuclear weapons that corresponds to our 
financial and economic capabilities." 
  So it is still too early to put the period to the history of 
nuclear arms in Ukraine. And time will tell how it will be in 
the future. But one thing is clear now--after the ratification 
of START, there are no fewer problems in Ukraine. A difficult 
path to non-nuclear status and heavy and crucial work lie ahead. 
Both for the politicians and for the military. Neither domestic 
nor foreign journalists at the press conference, by the way, 
were interested in the fate of the servicemen of the 43rd Army. 
Until the diplomats agree, responsibility for security connected 
with the strategic arms--from ecological to military--rests with 
the people in uniform.

<F P=106> [Article by Lt Col Vladimir But, correspondent: "The Army </F>
Needs Discipline and Organization and Not the Passions of 
Political Rallies"] 
  [Text] Frequent business trips by General of the Ukrainian 
Army Vitaliy Radetskiy, the Ukrainian defense minister, to 
military garrisons and military units have become a noteworthy 
feature of his leadership style. The defense minister's routine 
business trip to Vinnitsa and his visit to major aviation and 
missile formations located there could be singled out here with 
special grounds. The fact is that an edict signed by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk, supreme commander-in-chief of the 
armed forces, appointing Lieutenant General Vladimir Antonets as 
commander of the air forces, was one of the reasons for the 
defense minister's meeting with the aviators. The new commander 
was presented to the personnel at this time. 
  It must be said that this appointment evoked far from a 
uniform reaction among generals and officers of the Ukrainian 
Air Force. The mass media reacted to this immediately. In 
particular, citing some mysterious "reliable source," the 
newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI hastened to communicate to its 
readers that seven air force generals submitted their 
resignation papers in response to General Antonets's appointment. 
  However, this assertion does not correspond to reality, to 
put it mildly. During his visit to a major aviation formation 
the minister of defense and his working group, which consisted 
of deputy defense minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, chief of 
the Main Directorate of Educational, Social and Psychological 
Work of the Ministry of Defense Lieutenant General Anatoliy 
Kobzar, and chief of the Main Personnel Directorate of the 
Ministry of Defense Lieutenant General Grigoriy Dyachuk, 
established that none of the generals were intending to retire. 
  Though as was mentioned above, far from all air force 
generals and officers approved of Lieutenant General Vladimir 
Antonets's appointment as commander; earlier, he was an active 
proponent of merging the air forces and air defense troops into 
a single armed service. As we know, this unification was 
legalized by an edict of the Ukrainian president, and was 
implemented over the course of several months. However, noted 
defense minister General of the Ukrainian Army Vitaliy Radetskiy 
in his speech to the aviators, reality demonstrated the 
premature nature of such a decision. Unification of the air 
forces and air defense troops required a strong economic base, 
considerable financial outlays, and creation of a single system 
of control. None of this exists as yet. 
  This is why a recent presidential edict recognized the 
existence of two armed services--the air forces and air defense 
troops. The earlier presidential edict was voided. 
  Shedding light on this issue, the defense minister dwelled 
in 
detail on the key problems of service by the aviators. They are 
well known to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. The 
main ones include the shortage of POL and spare parts (as a 
result of which combat readiness is suffering), a low level of 
discipline, a high rate of injuries and deaths among the 
personnel, and of course, the poor social protections afforded 
to servicemen. 
  The leadership of the Ministry of Defense is seeking and 
finding the ways of solving the currently existing problems. It 
is precisely owing to such efforts that officers and warrant 
officers have started receiving a food ration, and 
appropriations for housing construction and to cover other 
social needs of the servicemen are being "wrested out." In this 
case the resources for this are being obtained not only from the 
state budget but also through increasingly more active 
attraction of foreign credit, on the basis of which entire 
residential districts have been and are being built. 
  In order that servicemen could begin receiving their pay and 
allowances on time in the future, and the military units could 
make their various payments, a decision was made to revive field 
institutions of the State Bank. 
  During a meeting held this day with officers of a certain 
major missile formation, the defense minister emphasized that 
Ukraine must become a missile and space power. This will require 
retaining the specialists, equipment and the command and control 
systems now present in the missile forces. This process must be 
carried out consistently, in a civilized way, without pressure 
and without causing harm to people. And this is in fact the way 
it is proceeding. No one is being forced to take the Military 
Oath of Allegiance to the people of Ukraine, which is what an 
article carried by a certain major newspaper of the 
near abroad asserts. Much in it was distorted. The officers are 
making their choice consciously, and they are serving the state 
of which they are citizens. 
  General of the Ukrainian Army Vitaliy Radetskiy replied 
exhaustively and effectively to the numerous questions from 
aviators and missilemen. A business-like discussion was 
conducted on raising the prestige of the office corps, manning 
the units and subunits, supplying equipment and POL, raising the 
level of combat readiness and discipline, and providing social 
protections to servicemen. No independent sovereign state has, 
or can have, its own armed forces without all of this. Their 
development--and not their reform, which is something the 
defense minister emphasized--must proceed under the conditions 
of real and not imaginary democracy. The army is strong in its 
discipline; it does not have, and cannot have, room for 
all-permissiveness, for a political rally mentality, or for 
disregard of orders.

<F P=106> [First installment of article by Colonel Georgiy Kostenko, </F>
academician, under the heading "Organizational Development of 
the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience, Problems, Prospects"; 
"Fundamentals of National Military Doctrine: Structure, Content, 
Strategy"] 
  [Text] In connection with the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine's adoption of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine, readers 
are asking NARODNA ARMIYA to describe in more detail the stages 
of the creation and conceptual provisions of this important 
official document and the structure and content of the Military 
Doctrine. We accommodate their wishes. 
  An analysis of the material connected with the confirmation 
of the first military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian 
state shows that in the discussion of the draft the people's 
deputies of Ukraine constantly raised two attendant 
questions--on the content of foreign policy and on the attitude 
toward weapons of mass destruction, since without a 
determination of the position on these two principal issues, 
adopting the Military Doctrine was practically impossible. This 
is why the members of parliament approved in a relatively short 
period of time three important documents: "Guidelines of the 
Foreign Policy of Ukraine" (2 July 1993), the Military Doctrine 
of Ukraine (19 October 1993), and the decree of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine "Ratification of the Treaty Between the USSR 
and the United States on the Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Offensive Arms Signed in Moscow on 31 July 1991 and 
the Protocol Thereto Signed in Lisbon on Behalf of Ukraine on 23 
May 1992" (18 November 1993). That is, while still in draft 
form, the Military Doctrine accelerated confirmation of base 
documents determining the content of the holy of holies of 
national security of our fatherland--the strategy of Ukraine's 
military security. It would be perfectly correct to call the 
"Guidelines of the Foreign Policy of Ukraine," therefore, the 
doctrine of the foreign policy of our state, which is of 
importance in an understanding of the theory and practice of our 
organizational development for defense. 
  The qualitative state of contemporary military theory is 
reason to believe that the military scientists of the former 
Soviet Army have to their credit in the sphere of the theory of 
military doctrine output of a world standard. This permits the 
expectation in the future of the adoption of national military 
doctrines by many states of the former Union. The adoption of 
military doctrines by the Republic of Belarus and the Russian 
Federation are confirmation of this. I would like to emphasize 
particularly here that, as distinct from the said doctrines of 
the contiguous states, only the Military Doctrine of Ukraine has 
an open content. This is practical realization not only of the 
principle of a strengthening of trust in the military sphere but 
also the mentality of our people, which have throughout their 
history fought only defensive wars. This fundamental fact 
predetermined the defensive nature of the Military Doctrine of 
Ukraine. 
  But the defensive focus of military organizational 
development does not simplify the creation of the military 
organization of a state which has embarked on the path of 
independent development. The sum total of objective and 
subjective factors that have determined the complexity of the 
organizational development of the army and navy of Ukraine is 
without counterpart in world practice. The assertion that there 
is a simple version of the transformation of the groupings of 
the troops and forces of the former Soviet Army located on our 
territory into the armed forces of Ukraine is from the 
scientific viewpoint absurd, and from the professional 
viewpoint, not serious. The organizational development of the 
armed forces of Ukraine is a problem of many levels requiring a 
comprehensive solution. If there is at all an unambiguous 
resolution of it, one word may be used to describe this 
path--intellectual. After all, only professionals with in-depth 
theoretical knowledge and firm practical skills can create a 
mechanism of effective military organizational development. It 
is essential for this to know not only the content of our 
national military doctrine but also the general approaches to 
its formation. 
  Considering the phenomenon of the disintegration of 
superpowers and the complexity of military organizational 
development, military science toward the end of the 20th century 
has formulated its recommendations for states that have embarked 
on the path of independent development. In sum, these 
recommendations amount to the fact that it is expedient to build 
the military organization of a sovereign state in stages, on the 
principles of scientific content and legality. There is reason 
to believe that, despite perfectly permissible digressions, such 
recommendations of military science have been taken into 
consideration in Ukraine. 
  At the first stage (from 16 July 1990 through 24 
August 1991) Ukraine was determining its position with regard to 
its statehood. At the second stage (from 24 August 
1991 through 3 January 1992) the Supreme Council of Ukraine had 
in anticipation prepared the prescriptive-legal base for the 
organizational development of its own armed forces. At the 
third stage (from 3 January 1992 through 19 October 
1993) the organizational development of the army and navy began 
and the Military Doctrine was prepared and confirmed. 
Confirmation of the individual concepts of the organizational 
development of branches of the service, arms of the troops 
(forces), and headquarters components ensuing from the Military 
Doctrine is to be expected at the fourth stage, and 
at the fifth stage, confirmation of the official 
program of the organizational development of the armed forces 
and the official program of the development of arms and military 
equipment drawn up on the basis of these concepts. 
  Today, being at the start of the fourth stage, it is not 
hard 
to anticipate that, first, the elaboration of the concepts and 
official programs will require tremendous input and that, 
second, the organizational development of the armed forces is a 
process of higher-than-usual research-intensiveness, which will 
require fundamentally new knowledge and abilities of military 
scientists and military specialists. 
  The progressive nature of the future laws on military 
matters 
is expressed not only in the fact that the armed forces of 
Ukraine are authorized forces and resources for operations in 
all four environments--in space, in the air, on land, and at 
sea--but also in the fact that it is prescribed that the state 
have its own military doctrine. 
  Military doctrine is a scientific category. Realized in the 
form of an official constitutional-level document, it negotiates 
two stages of opposition. The first--on the part of 
military scientists and military specialists in the period of 
elaboration of the draft, and the second, on the part 
of members of parliament at the time of confirmation. This fact 
makes permits the belief that ultimately military doctrine 
represents the sum total of victorious ideas in the sphere of 
assurance of military security and the organizational 
development of the armed forces and their use. The military 
doctrine of the state is commissioned by legislative mechanisms, 
but its draft is prepared mainly by scientific methods. In 
accordance with this principle, substantiation of the structure 
and content of the military doctrine is the main mission of 
military science. But, negotiating the procedure of 
confirmation, the military doctrine undergoes certain revisions, 
and, after its approval, military science begins to experience 
the influence of the doctrine. That is, there is quite a strict 
direct connection and feedback between military science and 
military doctrine. This is the first fundamental point. 
  The second is as follows. There is every reason to believe 
that the latest knowledge has been taught in the military 
educational institutions in respect to the theory of military 
doctrine. But a comparison of the material of the debate in the 
journals VOYENNAYA MYSL and VOYENNYY VESTNIK of the Association 
of Independent Publications permits the conclusion that at the 
present time the theory of military doctrine is incomplete and 
cannot count on universality. The studies that have been 
conducted permit two conclusions. The first is that 
military doctrine should contain the sum total of precepts which 
permit its conjugation with the economic doctrine of the state. 
Otherwise there is a danger of the conversion of military 
doctrine into a military declaration divorced from the material 
basis of its state. The second is that it is 
essential that military doctrine have two groups of doctrinal 
precepts--classical (general) and specific 
(particular)--characteristic of the specific state. With this 
approach the theory of military doctrine may lay claim to 
universality. 
  The classical doctrinal precepts in the Military Doctrine of 
Ukraine, therefore, are the causes of a possible war; the 
sources of military danger; the attitude of the state toward 
war; the basic tasks of the state in peacetime and wartime; ways 
of ensuring military security; the missions of the armed forces; 
the principles of the organizational development of the army and 
navy; qualitative indicators of the organizational development 
of the armed forces; focus of the training of the army and navy; 
the role and place of other structures of the military 
organization of the state; preparation of the state and society 
for defense; opportune preparation of the economy for support of 
the armed forces; and ways of realizing the military doctrine. 
Given such precepts, the military doctrine may be conjugal with 
the military doctrines of contiguous and other states and thus 
be the basis of the assurance of military security. 
  The doctrinal precepts of the specific content ensue from 
the 
particular features of the geostrategic location of the state, 
the state of its economy, and the quantitative-qualitative 
indicators of the armed forces. 
  For Ukraine such particular features might be as follows: 
  The first--the state and its armed forces are 
built in organizational unity. Dividing these two processes into 
independent processes is practically impossible. By virtue of 
this fact, the crisis state of the economy is reflected with 
particular gravity in the combat capability of the army and navy. 
  The second particular feature ensues from the 
specific character of the disposition of the groupings of troops 
and forces stationed on the territory of Ukraine. It has come 
about historically such that they were created in a different 
military-political situation, were built according to different 
strategic plans, and provided for different versions of military 
operations. In the course of the organizational development of 
the armed forces of Ukraine it will be necessary to transform 
the troops and forces of the former two strategic axes of the 
Union into groupings of troops and forces capable of warding off 
aggression on any axis. 
  The third particular feature is expressed in the 
fact that there are no chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear 
weapons on the territory of Ukraine. The process of the 
elimination of the strategic nuclear forces has begun. This 
factor predetermines the need for the creation in the process of 
organizational development of the army and navy of an equivalent 
capable of ensuring the military security of Ukraine as a 
nuclear-free and neutral state. 
  The fourth particular feature consists of the 
existence of an intrinsic contradiction in the process of the 
organizational development of the armed forces. On the one hand 
it is essential to form full-fledged organs of command and 
control and large formations and units and, on the other, to 
reduce the quantity of the combat equipment to the quotas 
established by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe, to which Ukraine is a subscriber. 
  The fifth particular feature is connected with the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which may be resolved only 
politically. Applying the methods of military science is very 
difficult here. 
  The sixth particular feature is determined by the 
priority need for the formalization in a treaty and legal 
respect of the land border of Ukraine as a sovereign state. 
  The seventh particular feature has sociopolitical 
roots. Even quite recently, from the start of the 1940's through 
the start of the 1950's, there were on the territory of Ukraine 
the elements of four wars: world, patriotic, civil, and national 
liberation. This phenomenon signified the enhanced role of the 
subjective factor, which is expressed in the fact that 
individual social strata continue to settle historical scores 
between themselves instead of seeking ways of consolidating 
society and building the state and armed forces of the future. 
  Considering these particular features, the Military Doctrine 
of Ukraine realizes the following specific precepts: the 
strategic mission of the state; the role and place of Ukraine in 
Europe and the world; the content of military security; the role 
and place of military doctrine; the main military-political 
goal; the content of the foreign policy and military-political 
course; participation in the building of the structures of 
regional and international security; the attitude of the state 
toward weapons of mass destruction; the purpose of 
military-economic policy; scientific and technological 
priorities; ways of providing the army and navy with equipment; 
the procedure of the funding of programs of material and social 
support for the servicemen.

<F P=106> [Final installment of two-part article by Colonel Georgiy </F>
Kostenko, academician, under the heading "Organizational 
Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience, 
Problems, Prospects"; "Fundamentals of National Military 
Doctrine: Structure, Content, Strategy"] 
  [Text] A general influence on the sum total of both 
classical and specific doctrinal precepts is exerted by the form 
of military doctrine. Five basic forms, in accordance with which 
states' military doctrines are devised, are known at the present 
time. 
  The first contains military-political aspects, in the main. 
Thus a coalition military doctrine of the Warsaw Pact countries 
was devised in 1987. With this content the document lays claim 
to being more a doctrine of the allies' foreign policy than a 
military doctrine in its classical understanding. The second 
encompasses only military-technical aspects of the doctrine. For 
this reason the document is called a "strategy" or "concept." 
The national military strategy of the United States has been 
devised in accordance with this form, for example. The third 
form incorporates two groups of aspects: military-political and 
military-technical. The requirements of such a doctrine are set 
forth in textbooks on the art of war, but its practical 
realization has proven impossible. As we have learned, this 
structure of military doctrine has been abandoned in the Russian 
Federation also. The fourth form consists of three sections: 
Military-political, military-technical, and military-economic. 
This form was adopted for the Military Doctrine of Ukraine 
because of the high sensitivity of the military organization of 
the state to the condition of its economy. The fifth form 
contains doctrinal precepts in the form of a military 
declaration. On account of incomplete information, this is the 
path that has been taken in certain European states. 
  What has been said enables us to maintain that the first 
military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian state 
corresponds to its purpose in form and content. Its progressive 
nature is to be found in the fact that it is already connected 
with the doctrine of foreign policy and could in the future be 
linked with the economic doctrine of Ukraine and coordinated 
with the military doctrines of contiguous and other states. 
  The basis of the first section of the Military Doctrine of 
Ukraine is composed of precepts of military-political content 
aimed at the prevention of war by nonmilitary means, and the 
basis of the second section, of precepts for ensuring military 
security by military means proper. The sum total of doctrinal 
precepts provides for the organizational development of armed 
forces capable of fighting the wars of the future, termed by 
modern military theory sixth-generation wars. The creation of 
the material basis of qualitatively new armed forces is the main 
content of the third section of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine. 
  It has become obvious that the full-nomenklatura production 
of modern and prospective arms systems is not only economically 
inexpedient but also practically impossible. For this reason the 
doctrine contains the precept of supply of the troops (forces) 
in three ways: through national production; thanks to production 
in cooperation with other states; thanks to purchases overseas. 
Priority is given to dual technology here making it possible to 
manufacture output for military and civilian purposes, and in 
the competitive reviews of arms systems combat hardware making 
it possible to enhance the qualitative component of the troops 
(forces) and their fire and maneuver possibilities is considered 
the priority hardware. 
  The strategy of ensuring military security and the use of 
the 
armed forces has always been, is now, and will continue to be a 
sphere of special attention on the part of the country's 
military-political leadership, since there continues to be the 
theoretical possibility of the invasion of troops and forces on 
the part of a state laying claim to some territory and not 
considering its borders final. In this connection the military 
doctrine reveals the purpose of military policy, which consists 
of guaranteeing the national security of Ukraine against an 
external military threat, preventing war, maintaining peace at 
the national, regional, and global levels, and endeavoring to be 
in the future a neutral and nuclear-free state. Proceeding from 
the main purpose, the strategic mission consists of the defense 
of state sovereignty and political independence and the 
preservation of territorial integrity and the inviolability of 
the borders. For the accomplishment of this mission it is 
essential that Ukraine have its own armed forces. The precepts 
of the military doctrine proceed here from the fact that the 
border with contiguous states is established conclusively and 
that Ukraine itself is not an enemy for any state. 
  It is not hard to see that the strategy of the state is 
based 
on the principles of defensive actions. For this reason the 
military doctrine contains precepts of the use of the armed 
forces exclusively in cases of armed aggression and 
encroachments on our territorial integrity and the inviolability 
of the border and also in fulfillment of its international 
obligations. Ukraine's rejection of first use of its armed 
forces is sometimes erroneously confused with passive strategic 
defense. This is not the case. The military doctrine provides 
for active defense, which is expressed in the doctrinal precepts 
of preparation of the armed forces for a possible war. This 
preparation of the troops and forces consists of their 
assimilation of all the types, forms, and modes of military 
operations with regard to the laws of war and the principles of 
the art of war. 
  Considering the strategic purpose of the state in peacetime 
and in war and also taking account of its strategic mission, it 
can be seen that the main type of strategic use of the armed 
forces of Ukraine under the conditions of peacetime is 
premeditated active defense on all salients. Under the 
conditions of a possible war this initial state of the army and 
navy predetermines the possibility of the use of all known forms 
of strategic operations of the armed forces. The modern art of 
war attributes to such forms: strategic deployment, the repulse 
of a strike from the air and space, a strategic defensive 
operation, a strategic offensive operation. The precise 
concordance of the combat operations of heterogeneous forces and 
assets of different branches of the armed forces and combat arms 
is possible only within the framework of a unified purpose and 
strategic plan with the strict centralization of command and 
control on the part of the supreme commander. This is why the 
Military Doctrine of Ukraine contains the precept of joint 
operations with the armed forces in wartime of the Border 
Troops, the National Guard, the Security Service, the Internal 
Troops, and the Civil Defense Forces. 
  Summing up, I would like to emphasize that for the 
organizational development of armed forces capable of fighting a 
war of the future, military science of the future is essential. 
It is very important, therefore, that the first particular 
concept approved by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine following 
the adoption of the military doctrine was the Concept of the 
Organization of Research in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

on Observance of the Principles of Scientific Character and Legality

Ministry of Defense: "Ukrainian Military Delegation in 
Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Contacts of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense with 
military departments of the CIS countries are widening. A 
working meeting of delegations from the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Defense and the Kazakh Republic Ministry of Defense was held in 
Almaty on 16 February. The delegation to the negotiations was 
headed by: On the Ukrainian side--deputy defense minister and 
armed forces armament chief Colonel General Ivan Oleynik, and 
from the Kazakh side--chief of Air Force Main Staff Major 
General Alibek Kasymov. The problems of widening military 
cooperation and implementing agreements signed at the level of 
government delegations of the countries in early 1994 were 
discussed during the negotiations. 
  A joint communique was signed on the basis of the results of 
the meeting in Almaty. In it, the sides note their great 
interest in widening contacts between the military departments 
of the two countries on a broad range of issues. The principles 
of mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual advantage were laid 
at the basis of development of such relations. 
  The Ukrainian side expressed its readiness for military, 
technical and scientific cooperation in developing new forms of 
equipment and modernizing armament already in existence. Mutual 
understanding of Ukraine and Kazakhstan in this area will make 
it possible to carry out this work less expensively and more 
effectively. Interaction in development of the missile and space 
possibilities of the two countries is promising. 
  The Kazakh delegation displayed interest in more intensive 
use of Ukraine's repair base on behalf of the armed forces of 
Kazakhstan. The nature of mutual settlements will be refined and 
determined more specifically in the immediate future, and the 
possibility for quickly paying off existing debts is being 
studied. 
  Both sides made note of the extensive possibilities for 
mutually advantageous cooperation between the military 
departments of Kazakhstan and Ukraine in the areas of troop rear 
support, military education and other areas of military 
development. 
  Such bilateral contacts are in keeping with international 
obligations adopted through treaties, and they meet the 
aspirations of Ukraine and the Kazakh Republic without 
infringing upon the interests of any third countries. Hastening 
the efforts by the Kazakh Republic and Ukraine to draft a treaty 
on military cooperation was deemed suitable in the course of the 
negotiations. 
  On the same day the Ukrainian military delegation left 
Almaty 
for Tashkent, where it is to meet with Uzbek colleagues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Lobashchuk of </F>
the National Guard, member of the National Executive Committee 
and deputy chairman of the Lviv Oblast Organization of the Union 
of Officers of Ukraine, by Ivan Besyada, under the rubric 
"Elections--94"; place and date not given: "`Our Own Law in Our 
Own House...'"--first two paragraphs are ZA VILNU UKRAYINU 
introduction] 
  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr 
Lobashchuk of the National Guard, a member of the National 
Executive Committee and deputy chairman of the Lviv Oblast 
Organization of the Union of Officers of Ukraine [UOU], is an 
energetic and patriotic man. He was responsible for organizing 
the first loyalty oath to the Ukrainian people. He is the 
codesigner of the first Ukrainian battle flag, and the military 
unit in which he serves is the only unit in Ukraine that uses 
this national (rather than the old Soviet) flag. He is the 
author of the songs: "Return Me To My Homeland" and "The March 
of the National Guard of Ukraine." 
  Oleksandr Lobashchuk is a registered candidate in the 
election for the office of people's deputy in the Hvardiyskyy 
Electoral District No. 260. His candidacy is supported by the 
Union of Officers of Ukraine. 
  [Besyada] Lieutenant Colonel Lobaschuk, in your opinion, how 
is the building up of the Ukrainian Army progressing? 
  [Lobashchuk] The building up of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
is 
the most important and most difficult problem that our state 
faces. Ukraine inherited her present military force from the 
former Soviet Union, and, unfortunately, even today, its 
sympathies are in large part pro-Russian, especially in the 
highest command ranks. This is demonstrated in various ways. It 
is revealed most strikingly in the military's attitude towards 
the Ukrainian language, in the stubborn disregard of this 
language, as, for example, by the generals. Even in Lviv, the 
military procurator's office and military courts conduct all 
their proceedings in Russian. As a result, the principal task in 
building up an army that would be fully in line with the 
people's interests requires providing it with genuinely national 
cadres. 
  [Besyada] I fully agree with you. After all, is it 
imaginable 
for a true Ukrainian to declare that the rapid introduction of 
the Ukrainian language in the army may provoke opposition among 
the military, as Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has stated? 
And can we trust a man who has sworn loyalty to the Ukrainian 
people, yet refuses to speak the language of this people? 
  [Lobashchuk] I believe that Mr. Radetskyy's statement 
reflects his maneuvers aimed at simultaneously accomodating 
Russia and benefiting Ukraine. This cannot be. The claim that it 
is not possible to introduce the Ukrainian language in the army 
quickly on the grounds that this supposedly requires special 
programs and funds is completely unfounded. In any army (that is 
the nature of an army) everything is determined by orders. I am 
convinced that if a clear-cut order is issued, our army will be 
able to switch completely to Ukrainian in the span of half a 
year. 
  [Besyada] It seems that the situation in the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, just as in Ukraine as a whole, is not identical 
throughout the country. We would therefore like to hear your 
opinion regarding our Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military 
District, in particular. 
  [Lobashchuk] The population of Western Ukraine takes a more 
responsible approach to the building up of a national Armed 
Forces than do those living in the east or in the south. Here, 
the idea of statehood is clearly defined in people's minds, and 
this has a positive effect on the military. Consequently, the 
Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military District is in an 
advantageous political and moral situation. 
  [Besyada] The Union of Officers of Ukraine played an 
important positive role at the initial stages of the formation 
of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What are this organization's 
objectives today? 
  [Lobashchuk] Yes. The Union did a great deal when the 
building of the Ukrainian military began. It is also doing a lot 
at present. 
  But with the coming of Mr. Radetskyy to office, 
incomprehensible pressure began to be put on the Officers' 
Union. At its fifth congress, held in December of last year, the 
Union was forced to raise the issue point-blank: The UOU has to 
send its members to parliament so that they can defend the 
interests of what is indeed a national army within that 
institution. 
  [Besyada] This brings us to a very important question -- 
elections to the Supreme Council. What is your election platform 
based on? 
  [Lobashchuk] The substance of this platform is reflected in 
its very name, for which I chose the famous lines from our Bard 
[Taras Shevchenko]: "Our own law in our own house, our own 
strength and will." I support a parliamentary-presidential 
republic, a strong executive branch, and the elimination of the 
local councils of people's deputies, which should be replaced by 
a more traditional Ukrainian administrative organ, headed by a 
supervisor [uporyadnyk] and a popular assembly [viche] elected 
by the people at all levels -- ranging from the village to the 
oblast. I am in favor of uniting all national-democratic parties 
and movements as well as trade unions into a single political 
force, which would implement the idea of a strong Ukrainian 
state. The official language for everyone without exception in 
government and military service is to be Ukrainian. I support 
recognizing the Ukrainian Insurgent Army [UPA] as the fighting 
arm in the struggle for Ukraine's independence. 
  I reject Leonid Kravchuk's statement: "We have what we 
have." 
I believe that we should have what we want, what the Ukrainian 
people want. This requires a firm and resolute state policy that 
would guarantee the people adequate food, housing, work, and 
relaxation. 
  [Besyada] Naturally, your program devotes an important role 
to the building up of the Armed Forces. 
  [Lobashchuk] This is an especially painful subject for me. 
Because much that is being done in this sphere is not what the 
people want. Even the date of Ukrainian Armed Forces Day was set 
against the will of the people--not on the feast of St. Mary the 
Protectress [Pokrova], but in traditional Soviet style, on the 
date of the signing of the decree. 
  Ukrainian officers and ensigns [praporshchyky] and their 
families need to be shown greater solicitude by the state. I 
believe that in the very near future we must have a professional 
army. This can only be done by applying the territorial 
principle of military conscription. In other words, if a youth 
lives in Galicia, he serves in Galicia. Incidentally, this is 
the principle in effect in Germany. 
  In this, too, our Mr. Kravchuk has applied the old Soviet 
exterritorial principle, which had only one goal -- to 
intermingle various nations. The current justification given for 
this system is couched in seemingly noble terms: Young men from 
Western Ukraine will serve in Eastern Ukraine and thus spread 
the use of Ukrainian in this region. This is pure bluff. Orders 
are the only instrument by which the situation in the army is 
determined. 
  I believe that our soldiers should serve only one year and 
two months and be drafted only once a year in September and be 
released from service in November. This would mean significant 
savings for the state, and there are great social and economic 
advantages to this. This would completely eliminate the shameful 
phenomenon of "didivshchyna" [hazing of conscripts]. You should 
have seen the faces of the soldiers when the Supreme Council 
extended military service from one and a half years to two years 
on 19 November of last year. The soldiers and their parents were 
astonished by this swing in our state policy. 
  More attention needs to be devoted to the training of youth 
for state service. Programs in schools and higher educational 
institutions should include boot-camp type military training 
[tabirnu viyskovu pidhotovku]. Young men should be given the 
opportunity to become physically fit and become familiar with 
military equipment and a military regimen. Then the army will be 
receiving nearly fully trained professionals. 
  A great deal of pressure is being put on the National Guard 
of Ukraine today, and there is an effort under way to eliminate 
it. I, on the other hand, am for strengthening the National 
Guard, because it is currently the best psychologically prepared 
institution to defend Ukraine. Events in the Trans-Dniester 
region and on the border with Belarus attest this.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA press service: "The People With </F>
the Weapons Should Not Go Hungry"] 
  [Text] Where are we to get money? This may be the most 
acute issue at this time. Unfortunately, nobody has the 
answer--neither the people's deputies, nor the Ministry of 
Finance, nor the director of an enterprise that has been forced 
to give one employee in three leave without pay. 
  Where are we to get money? They come with this question to 
the commanders of military units--not just officers, but by now 
also women with children. However, the commanders have nothing 
to say in response, to say nothing of accommodating them. 
  Where are we to get money? Our readers bring up this 
question 
in almost all their letters to the editor. If NARODNA ARMIYA 
knew the answer or could show the way out of this difficult 
situation, it would have done so long ago. However, what are we 
to say, esteemed reader, if the supreme officials of the country 
are not in a position to say something specific in response to 
the "question of questions...." Therefore, we will only paint 
the picture that has now emerged with regard to the provision of 
funding for the Ministry of Defense. We hope that you will 
understand the situation. 
  Toward the end of December of last year, the minister of 
defense of Ukraine, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, wrote 
yet another letter to Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, the acting prime 
minister of Ukraine. The letter said that "the 472.0 billion 
karbovantsy allocated as of 27 December made it possible only to 
issue pay and allowances to servicemen for November and, in 
part, December. An emergency situation is developing in 
sustaining the routine activities of the troops. The absence of 
financing makes it impossible to settle with energy suppliers 
for electricity, heat, and gas used. As a result, the supply of 
electricity, heat, and gas to military settlements has been 
turned off (Kotovsk, Desna, Sevastopol, Kharkov, Pervomaysk...)." 
  An endorsement by Yukhym Leonidovych appeared on this 
letter, 
owing to which 200 billion karbovantsy were allocated for 
foodstuffs and 140 billion karbovantsy for wages. (Incidentally, 
the Ministry of Defense was supposed to get them in early 
December.) However, the minister of defense had sought 700 
billion karbovantsy to overcome the crisis situation. This was 
the minimum, he said. This was by no means satisfactory, and as 
early as 5 January, Major General Ivan Shtopenko, chief of the 
financial directorate of the Ministry of Defense, wrote a 
memorandum for the minister of defense recalling that "a 
critical situation has developed with regard to funding priority 
payments. Repeated appeals by enterprise directors, army 
collectives, people's deputies, and trade union organizations 
addressed to government organs with regard to the emergent 
situation have been forwarded to the Ministry of Defense, 
instead of being considered and instead of practical measures 
being taken. The requirements to meet the priority needs of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine for January of this year come to 1.313 
trillion karbovantsy, of which 743 billion karbovantsy is for 
pay and allowances for servicemen.... Besides, it is necessary 
to pay back the arrears of 720 billion karbovantsy for 1993." 
[The above quote is rendered in Russian in the original] 
  How is the military department provided for following the 
many appeals to the supreme officials of the country? We find 
the answer in a letter from Major General Ivan Shtopenko and 
Major General V. Krokhin, chief of the directorate of foodstuffs 
supply of the logistical headquarters of the Armed Forces, to 
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Valeriy Shmakov: "As of 21 
January 1994 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received funding 
in the amount of 25.0 billion karbovantsy, which comes to 1.0 
percent of the needs for January of this year.... Military 
collectives and the families of servicemen are finding 
themselves on the brink of ruin." 
  What can we add to this.... 
  Major General Ivan Shtopenko said in a conversation with a 
NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent: "Letters are just what they are, 
but you cannot help matters just with letters. The minister of 
defense begins virtually every day by visiting either the 
Cabinet of Ministers or the Ministry of Finance. We use every 
opportunity to get yet another portion of funds." 
  Incidentally, Ivan Ivanovych himself sets out for the same 
addresses every morning. When a NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent was 
talking to him in his own office, the Ministry of Finance 
called. At the other end of the line they joked: "We have 
already allocated a room for you here...." 
  You may have grown tired of reading excerpts from official 
documents. However, we deliberately cite them so that you will 
first better understand the state of affairs and second, so that 
nobody will get the impression that the military department 
headed by General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy is 
sitting on its hands. This is why we offer yet another letter, 
this time to President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, which was 
signed by the minister of defense. "I report that the Ministry 
of Defense of Ukraine submitted, at the appointed time, 
substantiated calculations of the minimum need for monetary 
funds in 1994 in the amount of 63.7 trillion karbovantsy to the 
Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the Commission for Issues of 
Defense and State Security of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
The above notwithstanding, the Ministry of Finance, without 
coordinating this with the Ministry of Defense and without 
grounds, included the limit of outlays of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine in the amount of 14.7 trillion karbovantsy in the draft 
1994 State Budget, which comes to only 23 percent of real 
needs." The letter goes on to say that the proposed amount "will 
make it possible to ensure only the issuance of pay and 
allowances to servicemen, wages to the personnel, payments for 
foodstuffs, clothing, and related gear (10.9 trillion 
karbovantsy), which comes to 74 percent of the envisioned quota, 
and what remains (3.8 trillion karbovantsy) does not even cover 
outlays to meet the vital needs of the Armed Forces (fuel and 
lubricants, municipal utilities, and so on). With this budget 
the Ministry of Defense will not be able to sustain the program 
to maintain the combat readiness of weapons and military 
materiel and lay the foundation for the programs of development 
of promising weapons and military materiel models." 
  The minister of defense sent this letter to the president on 
the eve of consideration of the 1994 budget. (Similar letters 
were also sent to the chairman of the Supreme Council, the 
acting prime minister, the chairman of the Supreme Council 
Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security, the 
minister of finance, and others). Certain things were factored 
in, but.... 
  The chief of the financial directorate of the Ministry of 
Defense reported to General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Radetskyy: "In keeping with the 1994 budget approved by the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine and the calculations of the Ministry 
of Finance, in January 1.6 trillion karbovantsy should be 
transferred to the Ministry of Defense in January, and 1.2 
trillion karbovantsy in February. Actually, 169.3 billion 
karbovantsy were received in January and 99.0 billion 
karbovantsy in February, or just 9.6 percent of the amounts due 
which were approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine to fund 
the troops...." [Above quote is rendered in Russian in the 
original] 
  This is the way it is.... 
  What is the way out? The chief of the financial directorate 
of the Ministry of Defense believes that the issue of financing 
for the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be raised promptly at an 
extraordinary meeting of the Defense Council of Ukraine. Do they 
really fail to understand there that the people with the weapons 
should not go hungry?... 
  Let us believe that this will be beneficial. However, it is 
impossible to overlook the main point: Life will not improve 
until the economy begins to work and a strict financial and 
credit system is established. Therefore, nobody will give us an 
answer to the question about "where we are to get money" 
tomorrow morning. Let us look the truth in the eye: Things are 
not going to get better in the immediate future, including pay 
and allowances for servicemen. We have to be prepared for that 
and not expect new "presents" from life. 
  Unfortunately, we are not finishing these notes on an 
optimistic note. One cannot spread butter on bread with lines 
from quoted documents or buy apples for children with them. We 
will repeat that there is just one thing we want: We should 
demonstrate understanding for all this and not resort to extreme 
measures, as some are proposing.

<F P=106> ["NARODNA ARMIYA Information" report under the rubric "You </F>
Have Asked--We Answer": "How Long Are We To Serve?"] 
  [Text] "Esteemed editor. The servicemen from a 
military unit in the city of Kremenchuk are turning to you. How 
much longer are we to serve if we were drafted into active 
service in the fall of 1992 for 18 months? Rumors are now 
circulating that we will serve for two years." 
  [Signed] Respectfully, servicemen from military unit 
39226. 
  We approached Major General Ostap Sapsa, first deputy chief 
of the Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with a request to 
comment on this and many other letters to the editor on this 
account. We quote his answer. 
  "In keeping with the Law of Ukraine dated 19 November 1993, 
`On Amendments and Additions to the Law of Ukraine "On Universal 
Military Obligation and Military Service,"' amendments 
concerning the duration of military service for soldiers, 
sailors, sergeants and petty officers who will be in compulsory 
military service for 24 rather than 18 months have been made to 
Point `a,' Article 23. These changes occurred during the time of 
service of the category of servicemen in question, rather than 
upon completion of the previously established duration of 18 
months, i.e. in December 1993. In the case in question, the 
effect of the law concerning the extension of the duration of 
compulsory military service by another six months covers this 
category of servicemen who were drafted into the army in June 
1992."

<F P=106> [Article by Servicemen's Social Protection Issues Committee </F>
Chairman Under the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, Major-General 
Vilen Martirosyan: "Servicemen Social Protection Issues 
Committee Chairman Under the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, 
Major-General Vilen Martirosyan: `The Primary Mission -- Is the 
Reduction of Social Tension in Military Units'"] 
  [Text] Right now it is difficult to name a strata of 
society for whom it would be easy in today's difficult economic 
situation. However, people in uniform are in a special position 
-- as if under the dual burden that is associated with the 
rigors and deprivations of army service. 
  At the same time, each of us knows very well that, during 
the 
last year and a half, the state has adopted an entire series of 
measures to ensure the protection of servicemen and individuals 
who have been released from military service from the most 
severe social consequences of the initial stage of economic and 
military reform. Believe me, it was simply impossible for the 
government to do more under these conditions. And therefore we 
must seek real paths for a solution from the dead end and cease 
acting from a dependent position. 
  Within the framework of the president's legislation, edicts 
and statutes that are in force, we need to seek opportunities to 
attract outside budget resources for the construction of housing 
and retraining of officer cadres for work in the national 
economy under conditions of the market relations that are coming 
into being, and the solution of other problems for which the 
state simply does not have any money at the present time. 
  Any delay in this matter lessens the state's prestige and 
creates the opinion among the majority of servicemen that the 
state is incapable of providing a fitting existence for its 
defenders. And the least steadfast -- as a rule, junior 
officers, not seeing a solution from the unsettled nature of 
everyday life, are beginning to be released from the army. By 
way of illustration, approximately 10,000 Armed Forces junior 
officers submitted requests for release last year. Forty percent 
of the Ukrainian Security Services agents who have been released 
this year did not serve until they earned the right to receive a 
pension. 
  Our Committee has data that today 93% of officers 
are not 
satisfied with their material position and 71% are not 
satisfied with their living conditions. On the whole, 88% 
of 
the servicemen polled feel that they are socially unprotected 
and consider the impending release into the reserve to be a real 
catastrophe for themselves and for their families. 
  While proceeding from the actual state of affairs at the 
local level, we must admit that the level of socio-legal work at 
the present time is not satisfying either the country's 
leadership or those who have a right to expect aid and 
assistance from the state. 
  What problems associated with this are the most urgent? 
  Despite the measures taken by the state, we have not managed 
to achieve substantial progress in the solution of the housing 
problem which has already passed into the category of 
socio-political problems. Based upon the situation on 1 November 
1993, there were 72,000 homeless military personnel in the 
Ministry of Defense, 8,000 in the Border Troops, 34,000 in the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 3,000 in the National 
Guard, 2,000 in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] internal 
troops, and approximately 1,000 in Civil Defense. 
  The situation is exacerbated by the presence of 29,000 
homeless servicemen who have been released into the reserve. As 
a result, according to our predictions the number of those 
persons needing housing among this category of the population 
will total over 160,000 people in 1994. 
  What solution do we see to the situation that has developed? 
  First of all, the attraction of outside budget sources of 
financing along with the allocation of budget appropriations 
toward the resolution of the housing problem. Already today 
quite a few commercial banks and enterprises are sending the 
Committee proposals to finance construction of housing for the 
military departments under terms of the transfer to the investor 
of 35% of the housing built in accordance with Ukrainian 
Presidential Edict No. 240/93 dated 1 July 1993. The power 
structures are only required to provide lots for the 
construction and to participate in the design of the buildings 
as a customer. 
  Last month, the "Transimpeks" Ukrainian-Russian Joint 
Production-Commercial Venture, "Dobrobut" Stock Company, 
"Logika" Small Enterprise, "Likvis" Joint Venture and "Ukraine" 
Bank proposed that to us. Proceeding from that, right now the 
Committee is developing the terms for the construction of two 
100-apartment buildings for the SBU [Ukrainian Security Service] 
and MVD in Kiev. We are studying the possibility of building 
housing for the border guards and cottages for reserve officers 
in Kiev Oblast and other oblasts of Ukraine. 
  The Ukrainian Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund, which was 
founded at the Committee's initiative at the end of last year, 
is rendering serious assistance in the search for additional 
sources of financing. In a short time, regional branches of the 
fund were created in all oblasts through the efforts of 
Committee representatives. Having established contact with 
business circles and the state administration, the Odessa, 
Kharkov, Kirovograd and Donetsk branches of the fund have 
created small and joint ventures in which servicemen work who 
have been released into the reserve. A significant portion of 
the profits from their activities is being directed to financing 
the centers that have been created for retraining officers and 
warrant officers who have been released into the reserve and 
courses to teach the Ukrainian language. 
  Of course, for now we are talking about only the first steps 
in this direction. But even right now the first results have 
already been noted. By way of illustration, the Fund's Odessa 
Branch has already attained sufficient strength to finance 
construction of an apartment building. Another two of these 
buildings are in the plans for the near future. The 
Ivano-Frankovo Branch has financed joiner's work in a building 
for servicemen's families. The Kirovograd Branch is investing in 
cottage construction. The Kherson Branch is allocating 
significant resources to assist large and needy families of 
officers and warrant officers and is partially paying for 
training of servicemen's children at paid educational 
institutions. 
  The social adaptation of servicemen who have been released 
into the reserve is a no less important problem. More than 
60,000 officers, warrant officers and members of their families 
will enter the job market already this year. By 1995, impending 
Armed Forces reductions will add another 100,000 people to this 
number. 
  It is impossible to say that this problem has only just now 
emerged. It has always existed. However, until the present time 
no one has been concerned about the fate of those officers and 
warrant officers who were released into the reserve. There are a 
number of definite aspects here. On the one hand, many 
enterprises and organizations and educational institutions would 
like to hire military pensioners to work for them, taking into 
account their high professional level, work efficiency and 
organization. On the other hand, each of the former military 
members is independently seeking work for himself since there 
still aren't any state guarantees for their retraining and 
subsequent job placement. 
  For example, only four percent of the servicemen released in 
the current year turned to the population employment service in 
1993, in the process, harboring slim hopes for independently 
finding appropriate jobs based upon their abilities and desires. 
  For the time being, retraining of servicemen is only 
sporadic 
in nature and does not match up either labor market requirements 
or housing infrastructure plans for those military personnel who 
have been released into the reserve. 
  Therefore, while beginning the State Servicemen's Social 
Adaptation Program, the development of which was assigned to our 
Committee by a 21 August 1993 Presidential Edict, we first of 
all took into account these circumstances and also the fact that 
there are outstanding possibilities for its successful 
resolution. These are: good training facilities that exist in 
practically every oblast, outstanding specialists and teachers, 
and the interest in this issue of business circles, not only of 
Ukraine, but also of the near and far abroad. 
  Among those who are ready already today to invest their 
resources in retraining military personnel is the European 
Community Organization which plans to allocate three million ecu 
[European currency units]; the Soros Fund that is known in the 
business world, England's Coventry University, the International 
Institute of Management (Dean Fedor Ivanovich Poddubnyy), 
"Dobrobut" Stock Company and many others. 
  While investing their resources in the resolution of 
servicemen's social problems, business circles know that this 
will not provide an immediate advantage. At the same time, the 
money invested will serve to a certain extent as a guarantor of 
the stabilization of the situation in the country by resolving 
servicemen's social problems which, in turn, will promote peace 
and tranquility in Ukraine. And, therefore, this will also 
ensure success in the work of the business circles. This is the 
first fact. 
  Second, well-retrained officer cadres will be able to 
rapidly 
adapt to the new situation and, through their labor, pay back 
the resources that have been spent for their retraining. 
  And third. You will see, whom will dubious organizations and 
criminal formations joyfully grab and receive? Military 
personnel, including former agents of law enforcement organs 
whom we have simply overlooked. And in the future, we do not 
have the right to permit this under any circumstances whatsoever. 
  Therefore, already today the Committee is setting forth a 
proposal to immediately create, (jointly with interested 
ministries and departments), servicemen's retraining centers in 
each oblast of Ukraine. It is advisable to create, based upon 
our Committee, a single coordination center to predict the 
number of officers released into the reserve, their professional 
consultation and mandatory job placement. 
  The center must facilitate matters so that each serviceman, 
a 
year or two prior to release, clearly sees what awaits him in 
the civilian sector -- where he can work with maximum output. We 
will give him the right to select his future profession and 
confidence in the future. 
  Of course, all of the problems of military pensioners are 
not 
reduced to the issue of social adaptation. There are many more 
of them because the rights and privileges that they had in the 
period of service do not extend to this category. The Committee 
is receiving literally an avalanche of complaints about late 
payment of pensions, which actually makes pensioners destitute, 
about the lack of required medicines, and about the callousness 
and indifference of the bureaucrats of the military and state 
departments. The Committee has received legitimate rebukes from 
the oblasts that attest to the fact that all of the targeted 
resources from the state budget for construction of housing for 
servicemen who have been released into the reserve have not been 
utilized for their primary purpose. Specifically, Vinnitsa State 
Administration, which has received 622 million karbovonets for 
this purpose, has not built a single apartment for military 
pensioners during the last two years... 
  We must direct attention to the fact that a socially 
oppressed person is inclined toward inadequate deeds. We can 
cite the example of that same Lieutenant Vladimir Zhukov from 
Kovel who chained himself to the Supreme Soviet building as a 
sign of protest against the lack of housing and an extremely low 
monetary salary. An unprecedented rally of homeless servicemen 
was conducted in Kiev in June. We can also recall the 
self-seizure of homes in "tsarskoye selo" that was organized by 
Kiev "Afghantsy" [Afghan veterans] and the picketing of the 
Poltava Ispolkom [executive committee] building by military 
pensioners. 
  The cause of these phenomena is the lack of social 
protection 
of servicemen and the consequences are a spilt of the army and 
the dangerous involvement of the force structures in the 
political confrontation. 
  Today much depends on which position the state's force 
ministers and business circles take. Will they permit officers 
who have despaired to stand under the banner of the dubious 
"fighters for a better fate" and to use the army for the actual 
destabilization of society and to disrupt the process of 
economic reform; or will they help to create a harmonious system 
of social protection, utilizing to the maximum extent possible 
the material capabilities of the state and departments and also 
outside budget resources. The success of the construction of an 
independent democratic state of Ukraine largely depends on the 
answer to that question. 
  Considering that the problems of this category of servicemen 
will significantly deteriorate as a result of planned Armed 
Forces reductions, the Committee considered it necessary to 
introduce additional guarantees and rights on job placement and 
social protection of those servicemen released into the reserve 
to the draft proposals and changes to the Law of Ukraine "On the 
Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and Their Family 
Members". Specifically, it provides for offering them work while 
considering the specialty no later than after a one month 
period, free professional training, rendering assistance in 
providing places in children's preschool institutions and in 
summer health camps to children of servicemen who have been 
released into the reserve, and other proposals. 
  In the future, we will strive for the award of deserved 
privileges to military pensioners. However, Ukrainian business 
circles can make their contribution to the social protection of 
this category of servicemen. This is a question not only of 
one-time charitable acts but also of the creation of jobs for 
veterans of the Armed Forces and assistance in the construction 
of housing. We have formed the Officers Bank, which will assume 
responsibility for the entire block of social and financial 
problems associated with the execution of the articles of 
Ukraine's State Budget for the military departments, and it will 
also do its part in the resolution of this problem. We assume 
that the central administration of this bank will be in Kiev, 
branches will be in Odessa and Lvov and a peripheral 
representative network will be in other oblast centers of 
Ukraine and at large military garrisons. 
  Seeing reputable partners in the Fund and Officers Bank and 
a 
reliable guarantor of state support in the Committee, Ukrainian 
business circles will mandatorily make contact and will invest 
money in the resolution of these issues, knowing that they will 
not "go broke". 
  We can count on success in this work only under the 
condition 
of the availability of good contacts and a mutual understanding 
with the leadership of the force ministries and departments. It 
is these interrelationships that the Committee has formed with 
the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the 
Ukrainian Security Service, the Committee on Issues for the 
Protection of the State Border, and the National Guard, whose 
representatives, who have been temporarily assigned to us, 
continue to defend in practice the legal interests of the 
servicemen of their departments. 
  The very practice of work has shown that the Committee is an 
important coordinating structure in the system of servicemen's 
social guarantees. This is reflected in the 21 August 1993 
Ukrainian Presidential Edict "On Urgent Measures to Reinforce 
the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their Family Members" 
that assigned to the Committee a number of very responsible 
tasks for the development of two state programs and two draft 
laws. And we handled these tasks thanks to close cooperation 
with the interested ministries and departments. 
  The resolution of the social problems of servicemen, 
pensioners and their family members with the attraction of 
outside budget resources -- this is one aspect of the matter 
that we can only begin today. 
  The other aspect is the support of our Committee and of the 
sponsors of social programs from the Ukrainian government. In 
our view, today the time has come for the Cabinet of Ministers 
to examine the issue of the reduction of taxes on the profits of 
enterprises, organizations, commercial and management structures 
and on the sum of the resources invested in the Ukrainian 
National Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund or its regional 
funds for the accomplishment of targeted programs for the 
construction of housing and the retraining of servicemen who 
have been released into the reserve. 
  It is also legitimate to pose the question on the 
possibility 
of the issuance of low-interest credits by the state to 
enterprises and organizations that will be involved in the 
realization of state programs for the social protection of 
servicemen and their family members. 
  I have highlighted only the primary problems of the social 
protection of servicemen. There are no more important tasks 
right now than the reduction of social tension in military 
collectives. And we need to concentrate all efforts toward that.

<F P=106> [Interview of Colonel Dainis Turlais, Defense Forces </F>
Commander, by Guntis Stamers: "A Running Officer Provokes 
Laughter in Peacetime"] 
  [Text] 
  [Stamers] Speaking at the Foreign Policy Institute of Latvia 
you said that potential threats to our country are currently 
greater than the capablity to meet them. The Cabinet of 
Ministers at the last moment changed the draft budget, proposing 
an increase in resources for the defense forces. Please specify 
what steps are anticipated to improve the condition of the 
defense forces. 
  [Turlais] Unfortunately I cannot say anything, because 
Latvia 
is ruled by a unique situation: the Commander of the Army does 
not participate either in assesssing the needs of the defense 
forces, nor in dviding up the budget, that is, deciding who 
needs the most. In truth the government disinforms the 
taxpayers: The sum alloted for defense also includes financing 
for various state institutions unrelated to defense. People 
conclude that the Army is alloted large sums of money, but I 
cannot tell exactly how much. No one has provided an overview of 
how much has gone to the army in the previous two years, nor do 
I know how much there will be. 
  It seems to me that the main problem is that the Finance 
Ministry has a rather murky idea of what the defense budget 
should look like, what it should include, and what its 
organizational structure is. The Finance Ministry ought to have 
a department, or at least a section, which works with the 
military budget. There is no way that a "Soviet" accountant can 
develop a state defense budget! 
  The second problem is that the defense budget, by virtue of 
its very size, becomes political; ideology, rather than 
practical needs, becomes the determining factor. 
  [Stamers] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Saeima 
Foreign Affairs Commission, has expressed the opinion that as 
Latvia's first priority it is essential to secure real control 
over our territory, and he has suggested that defense be offered 
the means to obtain an anti-aircraft defense system: 
Ground-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons. Do you believe 
that that is a priority? 
  [Turlais] Yes. We have discussed these questions with Mr. 
Kirsteins. You must understand that a country's borders include 
not only the dry land and the sea, but also air space is 
included in a coutry's territory. That does not mean that we 
must shoot everything down to the ground, but we must know, must 
control who finds their way into this airspace--with or without 
our permission--and we must implement also security operations. 
In turn, about land forces armaments, if there are no anti-tank 
devices, we cannot talk seriously about our defense forces, the 
Home Guard. We will not challenge tanks with clubs, sticks and 
Molotov cocktails alone. 
  [Stamers] Estonia has decided to buy weapons, this same 
kind, 
from Israel. When Latvia decides, will it also be Israel? 
  [Turlais] That's not of primary importance. The question is 
a 
different one: "Why is Latvia doing nothing?" We both started at 
the same time, but now the Estonians have both anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft systems and armored transport. The Estonian Army 
has the technology; they have mobilized battalions that are able 
to function. The Lithuanians are also armed; they have ships, 
airplanes with missiles. They are capable of doing something. 
Why are we implementing almost nothing? Why have there been no 
final decisions on my initiatives to manufacture cartridges, to 
purchase weapons? 
  [Stamers] Do you know the answer to this question? 
  [Turlais] I think that everyone knows how many shrill 
politicians we have who are able to philosophize and talk about 
anything, but really do nothing, only create a situation in 
which the government does not take practical steps. That is to 
an extent the weakness of the government, that everything is 
done looking backwards: What will be the reaction? Who will 
criticize us? But the country's security interests cannot be 
based only on popularity. The election campaign must be 
forgotten. We must remember that now there is a government and 
it must take responsibilty. It can only be taken by doing. To do 
nothing would be irresponsible. 
  [Stamers] In your opinion are the chief culprits the 
indecisive ministers who prepare the budget? 
  [Turlais] Without a doubt! No one else has state authority 
to 
supply the army, to purchase weapons. We could go down a 
different path, trying to reach an agreement with "Pardaugava," 
to find out if that concern needs an army. If the government 
decides to attach the army to some firm, then this firm could be 
given the authority to buy weapons, to supply the army. Only one 
must ask whether the army would defend the state's interests in 
such a case? 
  [Stamers] Let's discuss the defense forces themselves. 
Everybody remembers that there was a review carried out to 
clarify their readiness for battle. What has been done since 
that time to decrease the length of time necessary for the army 
to be ready for battle after a declaration of emergency or war? 
  [Turlais] I do not know who decided that the length of time 
was too long and who wants to set the criteria. To review combat 
readiness one must know at least the basics of what that means. 
If combat readiness is evaluated based on how quickly and and in 
what direction a soldier runs when someone whistles, then the 
saying comes to mind: "A running officer in peacetime provokes 
laughter, but in wartime he provokes panic." 
  [Stamers] So then, what are the criteria for combat 
readiness? 
  [Turlais] First of all, the extent to which the army's 
material-technical needs are ensured, to execute its 
assignments. Secondly, the human factor, or how high is the 
level of training for any soldier, from army commander to 
infantryman; how well do they understand their assignments, how 
prepared are they to carry them out. Thirdly, the effectiveness 
of the leadership system. There three factors also establish 
battle readiness. If one of them is zero or at only a low level, 
then the level of battle readiness, regardless of how high the 
other indicators are, will not exceed the level of the lowest 
factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, then the rest of 
the conditions for battle readiness will not save them. And 
similarly, if there is no leadership, then an armed army also 
cannot do anything. 
  To perceive battle readiness in such an illiterate way as 
was 
done is shameful and unseemly. It does not reflect on the level 
of the army, but rather on the level of the Saeima commission, 
to examine in such a way and not to draw any conclusions 
regarding what the legislators must do to change the situation. 
  [Stamers] Do you assert that neither the Saeima, nor the 
government is taking into account that battle readiness must be 
resolved with a complex approach? 
  [Turlais] I think that they are practically not working in 
that way. 
  [Stamers] A question related to the 10 Jaunuary [1994] 
incident. The proposed national security policy, which was 
developed by the Defense Ministry, stated that one possible 
security threat to Latvia is the conflicting lines of authority 
of the Latvian armed services. As was exemplified by the 
aforementioned incident, the fact that the municipal police were 
given an order by a municipal leader could have led to a 
military conflict. What would you suggest and what is being done 
to change the situation? 
  [Turlais] Currently, according to U.N. data, it seems that 
there are 186 countries in the world and Latvia, I think, is the 
only country in which the Armed Forces are not led by the 
Defense Ministry, the government. There are no alternative 
solutions: All armed forces must be under the control of the 
Defense Ministry. Then at least there will be a specific 
responsible official. If a conflict arises, then the Defense 
Minister alone will be able to resolve the problem, that would 
be his responsibility. But right now, for example, to 
disentangle a conflict, first, one must find the Home Guard, 
persuade their chief that they have not acted properly and then 
the chief tries to recall or influence the Home Guards. Or also 
one must seek out the municipal police chief and try to persuade 
him that the municipality alone does not make policy, but that 
the government, too, has a word. After that there appears a 
third power: The municipality chairman, who has established his 
own guards and armed them himself. 
  [Stamers] But in accordance with the Constitution the 
President is formally the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. 
  [Turlais] It is up to him, no doubt, to achieve that in 
reality, as well as formally. 
  [Stamers] Your Ministry is developing the state defense 
policy. When will deputies and the press be able to see it? 
  [Turlais] The mass media also does everything possible to 
disinform people and to preclude that to which we aspire. We 
have rejected the former Soviet armed forces and security model. 
We have turned toward Western Europe, to the democratic states 
model, but our consciousness is still hobbling along on both 
legs; we think like Communists. You, speaking to me as the 
Commander of the Army, are always asking me, "What is the 
Defense Ministry doing?" I do not know! The Defense Ministry is 
a government institution, which is above the defense forces as 
civilian political control. It is concerned with planning 
defense policy, with planning and implementing budgets, with 
control of the Army. The Army is not a component part of the 
ministry. It is time to forget the Soviet model! We have only 
the Home Guard under the "Marshall principle," in which there is 
nothing above the "Marshall." That is not right. Above all 
military forces must be under civilian political control. The 
Armed Forces themselves may not establish policy, influence 
goverment decrees and dictate conditions. 
  [Stamers] Good. I will give the previous question to 
Minister 
Pavlovskis. 
  [Turlais] Of course, defense policy interests me, too. And 
as 
a professional I want to say that it should not be exaggerated 
with an ominous analysis. I say, if we do not have that, then we 
can do almost nothing. In the world everything changes; both our 
domestic and our foreign policies are dynamic. What would happen 
to ominous analyses? In the time it takes to draft them, print 
them, while it goes through the bureaucratic apparatus and comes 
to examination to adopt it a month has gone by and the situation 
is completely different. In place of that we must try to look at 
the future strategically. 
  There must be people responsible for the country's security: 
The Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Saeima, which must pass 
laws so that the government, the Prime Minister and the armed 
forces can operate. But it cannot be that each deputy dictates 
to me to do what he views as the best. Deputies have the right 
to use their votes to develop laws, but not to dictate a stance 
or their fancies. I would like to find another among the 186 
countries in which a deputy arrived at headquarters and sounded 
an alarm.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Juknevicius: "The Project for the </F>
Reorganization of the National Defense Ministry Provides for 
Wide Epaulets for Almost Every Official"] 
  [Text] Following the reorganization of the National Defense 
Ministry, 123 people should be employed in it: 27 individuals in 
the Personnel and Social Welfare Department, 22 in Economics and 
Finance, 23 in International Communications. In the economic 
section, eight officers will be in charge of nine temporaries, 
electricians and chairwomen. It is planned to have a major serve 
as the minister's aide; his deputy, a state secretary, will be a 
general; and colonels will serve as department directors. The 
Ministry of National Defense between the wars had a total of 42 
officials. 
  In the opinion of K. Gaska, member of the parliamentary 
committee on national defense, this reorganization is just a 
"soap bubble," a waste of funds, and a militarization of the 
ministry, because most of the ministry personnel will be given 
official military ranks. 
  "I would understand it if the 27 people doing personnel and 
social welfare work would be taking care of the Lithuanian army 
structures, but this institution will have a department charged 
with the same functions," K. Gaska said. K. Gaska cannot 
understand why the project provides for a military "ministry of 
foreign affairs" -- that is how large the International 
Communications Department is. 
  Chief of general staff, Colonel S. Knezys, confirmed that, 
as 
a preliminary measure, personnel and social questions in the 
Lithuanian military command apparatus will be handled by five, 
economics and finance by nine, and military communications with 
abroad by six officials (including the three interpreters). 
  S. Knezys said that the separation of the functions of the 
army leadership from the National Defense Ministry was a 
complicated step, because a similar experience did not exist. On 
the other hand not only the army's institutions but also those 
of the state border control and civil defense are subordinate to 
the ministry. It is not yet known who will perform what 
functions. 
  "Each department could buy its own furniture, but the 
ministry would probably be able to buy the canisters for 
everybody at the cheapest price," S. Knezys said. According to 
him, the processes of the creation of the army apparatus and of 
the reorganization of the ministry are being coordinated; the 
number of people in each ministry department might change after 
two or three months. 
  The press representative of the National Defense Ministry, 
L. 
Zegeriene, said that his process of the reorganization of the 
ministry was not a final one. The reorganization may still take 
several months longer. The analogous experience of the West 
European states will be studied. L. Zegeriene thinks that the 
future ministry may not require a large department of protocol. 
The international relations department could also be smaller.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major-General Iskender Allahverdiyev, Deputy </F>
Minister of National Security of the Azerbaijan Republic and 
commander of the border troops, by Sohbet Seferli: "There Is No 
Foundation To Rumors That Border Troops From Another State Will 
Be Stationed On Our Borders"] 
  [Text] Recently a meeting of border troops' commanders of 
CIS states was held in Ashgabat. At this meeting, attended also 
by a delegation from the Azerbaijan Republic, documents prepared 
on the smuggling of narcotic substances across borders, 
additional changes to the staff structure of liaison services of 
the Council of Border Troops Commanders, mutual principles of 
the material-technical equipment of border troops, the 
submission of an accounting of the 1993 costs of liaison 
services and a draft of costs for the first quarter of 1994, 
plans of the Commanders' Council and and their liaison services 
for the first half of this year, the time and places of regular 
meetings of the Commanders' Council, and other important 
questions were discussed. In connection with this, our 
correspondent met with Major General Iskender Allahverdiyev, 
Deputy Minister of National Security and commander of the border 
troops, and interviewed him. He said: 
  "The Council of Border Troops Commanders will meet once a 
quarter and discuss questions pertaining to borders. Since the 
Azerbaijan Republic has also joined the CIS, it is natural that 
we participate in the planning of this organization. At present, 
Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Azerbaijan have established 
their own border troops, and other states of the former USSR are 
in the process of doing so. The need for our participation at 
this meeting also stems from the fact that borders between the 
CIS states are porous, and the organization of the defense of 
borders with non-foreign states cannot but disturb each of us. 
Certainly this disturbance also pertains to us, and one of the 
issues discussed at the Council's Ashgabat meeting was on the 
protection of state borders under conditions of mutual 
cooperation." 
  The establishment of material-technical equipment on the 
borders was also widely discussed. As is known, the basic 
equipment used in protecting the borders is produced in Russia 
and other states. From this point of view, for the best 
organization of our borders, we have to cooperate on reaching 
compatibility with the CIS states. 
  Finally, the passage of narcotic substances, weapons and 
other contraband products across borders was an important 
question of interest to all the states. Discussion of this 
question, which is not within the power of any one state to 
solve on its own, also aroused great interest among meeting 
participants. It remains to say that there is no foundation for 
the rumors being spread on the stationing of troops from another 
state on the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic. As for the 
recent quick visit to Baku of Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander in chief of Russian border troops, this had nothing to 
do with the issue. His journey was in connection with our 
borders with Russia. In general, Russia believes that we can 
protect our own border. 
  [Seferli] General. Quite some time has passed since the 
border troops in our republic were established. What is the 
situation today? 
  [Allahverdiyev] Certainly, in spite of all the difficulties, 
we are making progress and the border troops have been created. 
It goes without question that had there been no war, we would 
have been able to do this job much faster. Our zealous and brave 
specialist officers in the national army are fighting the enemy. 
Hopefully, after the war is ended the majority of them will 
return to the border troops. Our young officers are also 
maturing. There is a special faculty at the Bak All Forces 
Commanders' School which is training border officers. We are 
participating closely in its operations. From next year, more 
young officers will be sent to border detachments and take part 
in the creation of border troops. 
  [Seferli] Our borders in the occupied territories have been 
destroyed by the enemy. As the result of brave attacks by our 
soldiers, a significant portion of our borders with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran have been liberated. How will the repair work 
in these territories be conducted? What kind of help will the 
CIS states offer? 
  [Allahverdiyev] In fact, some of our borders are in very bad 
shape, but this is not to say that our borders cannot be 
protected. There has to be the technical means, meaning 
technical equipment, channels of communication, etc., for border 
protection. In the opinion of most of the participants at the 
meeting, barbed wire should not be strung across the borders 
again. Borders have to be protected in a civilized manner, as in 
the European countries. There is no doubt that there has to be 
political and economic stability in our countries for this; the 
appropriate laws have to be prepared and normal conditions for 
the protection of borders have to be created. 
  In the border zone liberated from the enemy, engineering and 
technical equipment and buildings have been considerably 
damaged, and in some places buildings have been burned to the 
ground. Our border troops, in conjunction with our national 
army, have been restoring our borders as soon as they have been 
liberated. I would like to make use of this opportunity to say 
to your readers that the protection of borders is a matter for 
the state and all its people. If we do not believe in each 
other, on the contrary, if we hurl inappropriate accusations at 
each other, if we make our work more difficult, we will be 
unable to achieve the desired result. All of us, whether at the 
state level or at the level of the normal citizen, must help in 
the protection of our borders and help our border troops. All of 
us are obligated to give this help.

<F P=106> [Article by Nayiri Badalyan: "The Army Needs Reserves and </F>
Supplies"] 
  [Excerpts] Martakert [Nagorno-Karabakh]--The war continues 
in Artsakh. It continues with unrelenting intensity. The 
leadership of Azerbaijan does not wish to come to terms with the 
idea that, even after mobilizing all the resources (human and 
material) of that state for the battlefront, this offensive of 
unprecedented strength has failed like all the others before it. 
Even so, Azerbaijan continues to throw thousands of fresh 
conscripts into the meat grinder. Hoping initially to achieve 
quick success and to break through the defense forces of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] in any direction, [Azeri 
president Haydar] Aliyev tried to enhance his authority and to 
consolidate his rule in Azerbaijan. Because of that reason, it 
is not surprising that he is willing to lose large numbers of 
men and equipment for the sake of the most insignificant gain. 
Although the failure of Azerbaijan's latest offensive of 1 and 
1/2 months is evident, that country's propaganda machine has not 
stopped its boasts, drumming up the fictitious victories of the 
Azeri army. [passage omitted] This has been happening at a time 
when virtually all the major battlefields are filled with 
unburied Azeri corpses who have been left there by their 
countrymen for political reasons (so that the large number of 
casualties does not raise political complications for the Aliyev 
administration). In order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics 
special services of the NKR forces have been rounding up these 
corpses and burying them in mass graves. However, the Azeri 
authorities do not care: The killed soldier is replaced by a 
fresh one, the destroyed brigade is replaced by one from the 
reserves. A situation has been created whereby the fighters of 
the Artsakh self-defense forces, no matter how strong morally 
and convinced about the justice of their cause and their 
eventual victory, are faced with severe hardships because of a 
shortage of manpower. The boys, some of whom have been fighting 
without rest for 5 years, are tired--some even weakened as a 
result of continual sleeplessness and poor nutrition. The 
endurance of their organisms can only be explained with the 
astonishing Armenian will and ability to survive. The heroic 
defenders of the NKR have and virtually receive nothing. Their 
ammunition and weapons are primarily strategic, obtained from 
the enemy. Obviously that cannot and does not meet the 
requirements of a steadily intensifying war. Instances when NKR 
army units cannot pursue fleeing enemy formations simply because 
they are out of ammunition are not uncommon. The soldiers' lack 
of clothing and food is even more distressing. The principal 
elements of the Artsakh force are fighting in a state of 
semi-starvation. I saw with my own eyes how, in one of the 
supposedly most combat-ready (if it is possible to compare) 
units, the Stepanakert brigade, which was at one time led by the 
legendary Bekor Ashot, soldiers passed from hand to hand a few 
loafs of bread before going to battle. Breaking small pieces 
from the loaves each fighter proceeded to the post he is 
assigned. Those pieces of bread were supposed to be the food 
which would sustain them in a battle that could last all day. 
[passage omitted] 
  In these circumstances of manpower shortages the defenders 
of 
Artsakh have performed miracles. They have won victories which 
defy any military logic. Even so, the Artsakh army is in dire 
need of volunteers from Armenia and the diaspora. Today there is 
no man of arms-bearing age in Artsakh who has not been 
conscripted; all of them are on the battlefronts. The Artsakh 
army has only a small number of units, and that number is 
getting smaller each day. Artsakh no longer has any reserves. As 
Artsakh defends the cause of the Armenian nation today, the 
Armenian nation is obligated to enlist in Artsakh's cause. 
Artsakh's army is strong and combat-ready; it only needs 
enlisted men. On many occasions, the fleeing enemy is not 
pursued and the success of the Artsakh army is not fully 
developed because there are no complementary forces to take 
positions in the captured hills. Advancing soldiers often have 
to stop half way and take positions in order not to leave their 
rear unguarded. The same men attack during the day and keep 
watch at night without taking any rest. Meanwhile the routed 
enemy, having escaped hot pursuit, is able not only to rest and 
recuperate but also to receive large quantities of 
reinforcements and equipment and thus can reorganize its forces 
and resume its offensive. As long as the entire Armenian nation 
does not realize that the nation's destiny is being determined 
on the battlefronts of Artsakh and as long as throngs of 
volunteers do not head there with the call of blood, the war can 
take a dangerous turn at any moment. The people and government 
of Armenia must not allow the 150,000 Armenians of Artsakh to 
stand alone against 7 million Azeris, and must be aware that 
turning this war into a war of reserves cannot be allowed. Time 
is working in Azerbaijan's favor. The war must be concluded 
quickly. 
  It is time to wake up and begin building an army seriously. 
Also, we must not be deceived by the Azeri offers of ceasefires, 
which they remember and agree to only when they are in trouble. 
Those ceasefires are used by Azerbaijan to prepare for new 
offensives.

and Petr Karapetyan: "Georgia's Minister of Defense has Retired 
and Plans To Go to Russia to Study"] 
  [Text] On 9 February Eduard Shevardnadze accepted the 
retirement of Major-General Georgiy Karakashvili, Georgia's 
minister of defense, and on 11 February combined his duties as 
head of the Georgian state with those of acting minister of 
defense. Shevardnadze intends to appoint a new head of the 
military department in the immediate future. Observers name as 
possible candidates Colonel-General Anatoliy Kamkamidze (his 
career in the Soviet Army took him from cadet to deputy 
commander for combat training of the Carpathian Military 
District); Lieutenant-General Levan Sharashekidze (he has served 
as deputy chief of the political directorate of the Trancaucasus 
Military District and as military commissar of the Georgian 
SSR); Major-General Paatu Datuashvili (commanded the Transbaikal 
Military District in 1988-1990, and a rocket-assisted artillery 
battalion in the rank of lieutenant colonel, moved up in the 
Georgian army to first deputy defense minister of the republic); 
and Avtaidil Tskitishvili (commanded a regiment in the Far East 
Military District in 1986-1989; at one time occupied position of 
chief of General Staff in the Georgian army). There are other 
possible candidates for the post of minister of defense of 
Georgia. 
  Following his retirement, Maj-Gen Karakashvili held a press 
conference and announced that he plans to study in one of the 
Russian military academies (he has only completed a higher 
military artillery school; his last position in the Soviet Army 
was as a division chief of staff). He acknowledged that he had 
made a mistake in preventing the introduction of Russian 
divisions into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhasian conflict last 
fall and he has a positive attitude regarding the future 
location of Russian bases in Georgia, considering this to be 
"for the good of the republic."

  [Editorial Report] Several defense-related organizations, 
led by the League of Defense Enterprises of Russia, have started 
a high-profile, glossy publication providing information on 
recent Russian weapon systems. It is titled "MILITARY PARADE: 
MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX JOURNAL." The January/February 1994 
issue published in Moscow is a slick publication similar to 
several Western defense journals oriented on the arms industry. 
  A `Military-Industrial Council' is listed opposite to the 
table of contents and includes the following names: First Deputy 
Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin, MiG Designer A. Belosvet, Yuriy Glybin of the Defense 
Industries Committee, First Deputy Minister of Defense A. 
Kokoshin, Sergey Kortunov of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Ivan Materov of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, as 
well as representatives from the Yakovlev Design Bureau, Vympel 
Joint Stock company, Kamov, the Defense Armaments Directorate 
and the Security Council among others. The Editor-in-Chief is 
Yuriy Shashkov. 
  The Advertising, Sales/Subscription Office's address is: 
Military Parade Ltd., 69 Prospekt Mira, Moscow, 129110, Russia. 
Telephone: 971-3400, 971-6369, 281-3237; facsimile 288-5880. 
The subscription rate is US$360 for an anual subscription of 
six issues. 
  MILITARY PARADE appears to be a marketing device. It shows a 
variety of late model weapon systems and technology. It is 
printed in both English and Russian. The January/February issue 
contains detailed articles and glossy photographs, cut-away 
drawings and specifications of the KA-50 helicopter gunship, the 
MSTA-S 152mm self-propelled howitzer, the BMP-3, STRELA 10MZ 
SAM, SA-15 `TOR' SAM, Dragunov sniper rifle (SVD), the MiG-31 
long-range interceptor, Su-25 ground attack aircraft, the 
Tu-22M3 bomber, Mil helicopters, the SLAVA class guided missile 
cruiser, the START AND START-1 missiles, the MIR space station, 
the development of wing-in-ground effect aircraft, the YAK-141 
and YAK-141M VTOL fighters, LAZURIT designed small-submarines, 
TVK-AGRO 1.4 wheeled utility tractors and several small arms

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel A. Piskunov, candidate of economic </F>
sciences, senior instructor, Frunze Military Academy, under 
rubric "Military Economics"] 
  [Text] The cessation of global confrontation of the two 
superpowers is noteworthy in the fact that assurance of national 
security today is linked to a large extent with resolution not 
so much of military as of economic problems. The concept of 
economic security has appeared in this connection; 
its content encompasses a wide spectrum of purely economic 
phenomena affecting survivability, strengthening of society's 
social and political stability, and strengthening of the state's 
international positions. 
  Military, technological, raw material, ecologic and 
sociopolitical components of Russia's security largely form 
under the influence of government economic policy and of 
processes occurring in the national economy (see the functional 
diagram of conversion). Therefore it is quite an obvious fact 
that conversion also may substantially affect both 
national security as a whole as well as its components. The 
problem is to ensure that transformations in the 
defense sector contribute most effectively to realization of 
Russian Federation national-state interests. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-62A>           Functional Diagram of Conversion </FIG>





    It may appear that a reduction in military production that 
is 
forced (not so much politically as economically) will entail an 
inevitable weakening of national military might, but let us 
recall that it was this might that for decades undermined the 
foundations of the civilian economy, which was not only 
administrative-bureaucratic, but also simply poorly developed 
and technologically backward. Under these conditions a 
very important requirement of economic security is 
that reduced military production volumes be compensated through 
modernization and growth of the civilian sector of the economy 
by concentrating the "conversion potential" in those sectors of 
the national economy which set the tone for S&amp;T progress and 
determine prospects for society's industrial and social 
development. 
  Let us recall that we began conversion with neither a 
serious 
theoretical foundation nor substantiated plans and programs. 
This determined the complexity of its practical implementation. 
In essence, our conversion strides ahead of theory with but one 
purpose--to close gaping breaches in the economy as quickly as 
possible and at any cost. 
  But we already are seeing a transition from general euphoria 
concerning the socioeconomic capacities of conversion to more 
weighed assessments of the costs of its implementation, its 
speed and its depth. Calculations show that it is 
implausible to expect a serious return in the next 2-3 
years. Costs of renovating and changing the specialties of 
enterprises will be rather considerable in many cases. The 
depth of conversion is no simple matter. What is its 
optimum value that ensures a socioeconomic effect and preserves 
sufficient mobilization readiness of the military sector of the 
economy? 
  The question of the speed of conversion also is no 
less important. The opinion of specialists is that if we act in 
a vigorous, considered manner, then conversion of the defense 
industry will take at least 5-6 years. 
  A number of stages is envisaged. The first (1.5-2 years) is 
passage of legislative measures, scientific substantiation of 
programs and plans, and creation of conversion management 
structures. The second (3-4 years) is development of the 
economic machinery of conversion with consideration for ensuring 
the necessary level of mobilization readiness. And the third (in 
6 years) is real economic return. 
  The present conversion is for now very far from its 
principal objective of strengthening national 
economic security based on increased competitiveness of domestic 
products on the world market. The obvious interrelationship of 
conversion and economic aspects of national security makes 
transformations in the defense complex a task of strategic 
importance. In carrying out conversion one must not lose 
sight of ensuring the necessary level of Army and Navy combat 
readiness. 
  From a military-economic standpoint, conversion 
effectiveness can be achieved only if 
military-economic principles are implemented along 
with socioeconomic ones in conducting it: Assurance of a 
sufficient level of mobilization readiness in conversion 
enterprises; flexibility of conversion programs and plans for 
accomplishing a possible maneuver; optimum combination of the 
interests of national socioeconomic development and an increase 
in qualitative parameters of the Armed Forces; priority 
orientation of conversion enterprises in the military sector of 
the economy toward satisfying socioeconomic needs of servicemen 
and their families. 
  Consideration of these principles will permit minimizing 
conversion's negative influence on material foundations of Army 
and Navy combat effectiveness and combat readiness. 
  The role of conversion in Russia's economic revival and 
national security grows even more as a result of the delay in 
the West giving financial aid to our reform. In the opinion of 
many domestic and foreign experts, granting of a credit of three 
billion by the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and creation of 
a ruble stabilization fund are being postponed for an indefinite 
period. Under these conditions Russia simply has no one to count 
on except internal reserves. The production and S&amp;T 
potential of 
conversion enterprises thus can become the key to solving 
economic security problems. Here are just a few figures: Up 
until recently the defense complex produced 92 percent of 
equipment for light industry, 76 percent of equipment for 
agricultural machine building enterprises and 83 percent of 
medical equipment. As of the beginning of 1993 the defense 
complex provided 100 percent of television sets, sewing machines 
and cameras; 98 percent of tape recorders and refrigerators; 95 
percent of computers; and 81 percent of motor units [motoblok]. 
  Considering the enormous importance of the defense complex 
for the Russian economy as a whole, it is legitimate to view 
conversion essentially as a synonym for a structural policy 
followed within the scope of economic reform. In essence we are 
speaking of a dual understanding of conversion. Viewed in 
the broad sense, it coincides in content with 
transformation of the entire economic system and represents a 
transition from a deeply militarized state economy to a market 
economy. But in the narrow sense conversion usually 
is interpreted as a structural perestroyka affecting only 
military production. 
  But economic reform in Russia is slipping. In excluding 
serious state intervention and effective structural policy for 
now, it essentially caused spontaneous, poorly 
regulated conversion which has given rise to a threat not only 
to national defense capability, but also to the entire 
industrial and technological potential. 
  In our view, in the situation at hand it is necessary to 
localize military production at a limited number of enterprises 
forming the nucleus of the defense complex. That is 
first. Second, no more than ten percent of existing specialized 
enterprises should be included in this nucleus. A second layer 
(approximately 30 percent) should be made up of enterprises with 
"mixed" production, and the order for their manufacture of 
products should be formed primarily on a contract 
[kontraktnyy] basis. The other defense complex enterprises 
receive full independence, with fulfillment of military orders 
on an agreement [dogovornyy] basis. 
  Third, the nucleus of defense complex enterprises, which is 
concentrated in Russia, should have a territorially closed 
technological cycle for selected models of weapons and military 
equipment. Participation of enterprises of other CIS countries 
in cooperation in arms production is advisable based on ordinary 
contractual [dogovornyy] relations, but it is also necessary to 
take into account here the risk of destroying inter-republic 
economic ties and deliveries because of a complication of 
political relations. That is fourth. 
  Fifth, it is reasonable to reject today's existing demands 
for keeping reserve capacities in readiness and localize this 
problem in the defense complex nucleus. And sixth is the 
activation of arms and military equipment exports as an 
important factor of supporting the Russian defense complex. 
  All this dictates the need for changing general approaches 
to 
conversion. What can be done in today's far from simple 
situation? 
  Appropriate conditions must be created for 
reliable functioning of defense enterprises in a transition to 
the market, and their support, including direct and indirect 
measures, must be ensured. Direct measures are state 
budget appropriations for creating arms and for conversion, 
state orders, and requirements established by directive on 
certain kinds of activity connected with strengthening defense 
capability. Indirect measures take in many spheres: 
Economic (determining benefits and so on); organizational 
(creating public and commercial organizations to assist 
conversion enterprises); legislative (adopting laws, edicts and 
other legal documents regulating the sale of stocks and 
privatization and conversion of enterprises); information 
(creating data banks, advertising) and so on. 
  It stands to reason that implementation of these measures 
requires formation of a conversion market 
infrastructure, including such elements as, for example, 
commodities and raw materials exchanges which resolve 
problems of material and technical supply and sale of products 
of conversion enterprises. Financial support 
organizations (investment funds, specialized banks which 
guarantee investments, provide insurance, and conduct securities 
operations) also are called upon to play an important role. One 
cannot get by without functional cost-accounting 
organizations, which will assume responsibility for certain 
kinds of activity--foreign economic (including the weapons 
trade), reference information, marketing, advertising and 
publishing, security measures and so on. 
  Independent organizations and councils (a unique 
"conversion lobby") should develop priorities and an agreed-upon 
policy on conversion directions and assist in passage of 
appropriate bills, and consulting bureaus should 
assist in developing and implementing conversion programs 
through various services: Information analysis, consulting, 
auditing and so on. The State Committee on Conversion Affairs, 
the IMF, the VPIK [Military-Industrial Investment Company] and 
the RIAO [Russian Investment Stock Company] already are 
functioning in Russia. According to estimates made by these 
organizations, the volume of capital investments for conversion 
during 1991-1995 is projected to be R50 billion (in 1990 prices). 
  Analyzing results of the first stage of reform, it can be 
said that "shock therapy" hardly is applicable for such a 
rigidly centralized formation as the defense complex. In our 
view, a well thought out, echeloned conversion program would 
allow not only preserving and transforming the defense 
industry's scientific research and technological nucleus, but 
also would help strengthen the economic foundations of national 
security. 
  Specialists call breaking out of the crisis by using 
capacities of the defense complex the "conversion 
leap" of the economy. Such "leaps" were observed in the 
United States, Germany and Japan following World War II. The 
present Russian economy also retains potential capabilities, but 
it should be borne in mind that, as we already noted, conversion 
requires enormous outlays. In this connection I would like to 
cite one more opinion of experts: Under present conditions a 
reduction of 1 ruble in the military order involves 1.5 rubles 
needed to finance conversion measures. Hence the growing 
importance of commercialization and self-financing of defense 
sector enterprises which are changing specialization. 
  The following conclusions can be drawn from what has been 
said: Conversion of military production must be given the status 
of state economic policy. Attempts to orient the 
production and economic might of the military-industrial complex 
toward consumer goods production must be precluded, for this 
would signify destruction of our national wealth. 
  A portion of the military-industrial complex (the "defense 
nucleus") should be preserved in its initial purpose of 
strengthening Russia's new defense policy. And the main 
thing at which conversion enterprises should be aimed is 
the use of technological and professional potential for 
designing, manufacturing and introducing supermodern 
technological systems for manufacturing civilian products. In my 
view, taking these suggestions into account will permit ensuring 
Russia's dependable military-economic security.

Rudenko: "Has the Last MiG Been Produced? Won't We Be Left 
Without Both Combat MiG's and Il Passenger Aircraft?"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  The Situation </H6>
  The drastic and frequently wholesale reduction of the 
defense 
order has placed the majority of enterprises, KBs [design 
bureaus] and NIIs [scientific research institutes] in an 
extremely difficult situation. In order to survive and not lose 
unique cadres, one of them, on an emergency basis, has begun to 
develop and produce consumer goods, others -- more serious 
equipment: Medical equipment, lathes, and production lines for 
various sectors of industry, and still others -- among whom are 
Moscow Aviation Production Association (MAPO) -- have taken a 
course toward retooling the enterprise for scientific-intensive 
high-tech civilian production related to those products that 
they previously produced. 
  Today you can see the new Il-114 short-range aircraft, the 
"Grach" T-101 multi-mission 9-passenger aircraft, and 
"Aviatika-890" ultralites alongside the MiGs in MAPO's assembly 
shop. 
  It would seem that this is an ideal example of conversion. 
But, alas, for the time being, there is no ideal variant. No 
matter what good intentions guided the aircraft builders when 
they decided to produce passenger aircraft that are so needed 
today instead of combat aircraft, enormous resources and the 
presence of firm orders are once again required for the 
realization of these programs. 
  "We cannot independently begin series production of civilian 
aircraft, especially large aircraft, without the state program," 
says Association General Director Vladimir Kuzmin. "But, 
unfortunately, events are unfolding in such a way that we cannot 
count on that support, at least in the short term." 
  In the association's enormous assembly shop where up to two 
dozen combat fighter aircraft were assembled every month in 
previous times, today they also build two dozen, but ultralites. 
These small, multi-mission aircraft are also needed but, as they 
say, they don't make the difference. 
  The Il-114's could make the difference for MAPO but their 
series production, as we learned from a conversation with 
Association Deputy Chief Engineer Aleksandr Dmitriyev, is 
impossible without budget financing of MAPO and its 
subcontractors. 
  "We began work on this aircraft in 1991 in parallel with the 
Tashkent Aircraft Plant," says Aleksandr Fedorovich. "We hoped 
that, jointly with our Uzbek colleagues, the process of series 
production of the aircraft would be much faster and cheaper but 
our hopes were dashed with the disintegration of the USSR. 
Without the state program, there is no real price policy with 
the suppliers. There is no financing for the development of 
parts. As of today, the airframe is practically already ready 
but we cannot purchase the engines, avionics, and onboard 
equipment from the parts suppliers -- there aren't any 
resources. We need to pay 1.5 billion rubles for engines alone. 
And there aren't any guarantees that we will be able to pay back 
this money in the future. Based upon the most modest estimates, 
the cost of the new aircraft will be approximately R12-15 
billion. Today, what Russian airline company can afford this 
aircraft?" 
  And what is the result? We won't be flying in new Il-114's, 
but in ancient Yak-40's or An-24's. And when they completely 
exhaust their service life, and that will occur in 1996, we will 
transfer to trains or we will purchase aircraft abroad as, 
incidentally, we already do with long-range airliners. 
  Matters with "Grach", the developer and customer of which is 
"Roks-Aero" Stock Company, aren't much better. More than R1 
billion is required just to begin tests of the first aircraft 
which recently left the association's assembly shop. 
  But if "Grach" at least has some chance of taking off, then 
for the foreseeable future the MiG's that you can see at the 
plant actually don't have any chance at all. For the third year, 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense is not ordering a 
single fighter aircraft from the association, for reasons that 
we all know. 
  But even with the complete absence of the defense order, the 
aircraft builders don't intend to give up on combat aircraft. No 
matter how difficult it is for the association today, work on 
the production line where the assembly of MiG-29's is occurring 
is not being curtailed for even a day. 
  Our photo-correspondent caught Master Petr Vasilyuk and 
Fitter-Assembler Vladimir Bychkov at that moment when they were 
completing work on one of the fighter's assemblies. 
  The aircraft builders link the association's future not only 
with the MiG-29 but with its new modification -- the MiG-29M 
multi-mission fighter aircraft. This is a very promising 
aircraft which not only Russian but also foreign aviators have 
been eying for a long time. And with the proper financing, MAPO 
would have certainly already begun series production of the 
aircraft. 
  It is distressing that military programs have been 
terminated, but it is doubly distressing that the green light 
has not really been given to civilian projects. Due to the 
absence of financing, many defense complex enterprises have been 
compelled to resort to job reductions and to the termination of 
not only military but also civilian production which, in turn, 
results in the extinction of entire directions of domestic 
industry and, primarily scientific-intensive directions. Already 
right now we can cite quite a few examples when some defense 
plants have completely lost their previous profile and now 
produce products on unique lathes that could have been produced 
in small primitive shops. 
  The Moscow aircraft builders could also find themselves in 
some other field. A few of them know that in Moscow it is 
difficult to name such a large facility in the construction of 
which they would not participate. Here are only a few of them -- 
the Kremlin State Palace, "Rossiya" Movie Theater, the Olympic 
Stadium, the Circus at Vorobyevyye Mountains, Paveletskiy Train 
Station... And in MAPO's shops they also made Kremlin stars, 
sarcophagi for the mausoleums of V.I. Lenin, Georgiy Dimitrov, 
Ho Chi Minh, and Augustino Neto, the clocks that were installed 
on the White House and many other things. So, MAPO specialists 
will not be left without a crust of bread. But, with this 
attitude toward the financing of conversion programs, Russia 
could remain not only without combat aircraft but also without 
civilian aircraft.

  Many commanders of subunits and units remember these 
and other textbooks and reference works published in prior 
years. Intended for officers of the Ground Troops, they have 
made an inestimable contribution to their professional training 
and to the process of improving methodological mastery. 
  But time does not stand still. Military doctrine and, 
naturally, views on the organizational development of the Armed 
Forces of the Russian Federation, the preparation of the Army 
and Navy to repel aggression and methods of warfare have 
changed. Our doctrine has now gained a clearly pronounced 
defensive thrust. Reform of the Armed Forces is underway, and as 
a consequence the standard structures and regulation provisions 
on the organization and waging of battle are being clarified and 
the capabilities of the troops are changing. 
  This has made it necessary to review the programs of 
training, and make adjustments in the educational process and, 
first and foremost, the training of the officer corps. 
Meanwhile, as can be seen from your letters, dear readers, a 
scarcity of the corresponding literature is being felt in the 
units and subunits. 
  The Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Troops, foreseeing 
the development of events, has in a timely manner pointed the 
scientific-research institutions, the main and central 
directorates of the Armed Forces Main Command and the leading 
military higher-educational institutions toward eliminating this 
information vacuum. 
  Taking the urgency of the problem into account, 
VOYENNYY VESTNIK has taken an active part in this important 
work. We are planning to publish this year in the pages of the 
journal the most important and fundamental provisions of 
contemporary combined-arms battle.[.sup]1[/] The discussion 
will concern defense by subunits in the next few issues. The 
operations of the battalion, company, platoon and squad (tank), 
defense in the woods, in the city, in northern regions, at water 
crossings... You will find out about all of this from our 
features. Follow the journal. Try to make use of the advice of 
experienced military specialists in practice. 
<H5>  I. Defense </H5>
<H3>  1.1. The Aim and Conditions for Going Over to the Defensive 
and the Requirements for It </H3>
  The aim of defense is to repel an attack by superior enemy 
forces, inflict maximum losses on him, hold important areas or 
objectives and create favorable conditions for going over to the 
offensive. It is achieved by firepower against the enemy by all 
weapons on the approaches to the forward area; the repelling of 
the attack of his tanks and infantry and the stubborn retention 
of the positions, strongpoints and defensive areas occupied; and 
the timely shifting of fire and the utilization of terrain 
features, local objects, water obstacles and populated areas. 
  The defending side possesses a series of advantages over an 
attacking enemy: The occupation of advantageous positions and 
lines, in most cases ahead of time, the careful engineer 
preparation of the positions and their camouflaging. All of this 
makes it possible to make the fullest possible use of the 
capabilities of firepower and the protective features of the 
terrain, and to prepare for maneuver carefully. The 
effectiveness of nuclear strikes and the efficacy of enemy use 
of high-precision weaponry (VTO) are reduced by roughly two 
thirds, according to calculation, simply by digging in. 
Moreover, defenders make widespread use of mines, explosives and 
other impediments and set up obstacles. 
  Defense can be static or mobile, depending on the combat 
mission, composition of forces and weaponry, and the nature of 
the terrain. Static defense is considered to be the principal 
type. It is conducted by means of inflicting the greatest losses 
on the enemy in the course of holding prepared areas, and is 
employed in places where the loss of territory is impermissible. 
  Mobile defense is organized to inflict losses on the enemy, 
win time and preserve one's own forces. It is waged via 
successive defensive battles at layered lines that are planned 
in advance, in combination with brief counterattacks, and 
permits the abandonment of some portion of terrain. 
  A battalion takes part in the mobile defense of a brigade or 
regiment in certain cases, or conducts it independently when 
assigned to operations in the forward defensive area. In mobile 
defense the battalion, interacting with other subunits, forces 
the other side to advance in a direction in which a solid static 
defense has been organized, or facilitates drawing the enemy 
into areas where favorable conditions may be created for 
counterattacks, the delivery of fire and his defeat. 
  Defense is conducted intentionally when more active and 
decisive operations are not expedient, as well as when forced as 
a consequence of a resultant unfavorable situation. It may be 
prepared in advance before the start of combat operations--which 
is particularly typical of the initial period of a war--or 
organized during the course of battle. The conditions for going 
over to the defensive, include the presence or absence of 
contact with the enemy, the nature of his pressure, the 
condition and logistical status of subunits, time reserves, the 
time of year and day and the state of the weather. 
  In the absence of contact with the enemy, subunits may go 
over to the defensive during a period of threat as part of 
troops covering a border line (to support bringing up and 
deploying defensive forces), as well as be part of the main 
forces to engage in defense at the principal defensive lines in 
depth.[.sup]2[/] 
  Subunits furthermore go over to the defensive in sectors 
where the main forces will be coming up, deploying and going 
over to the offensive, as well as where an offensive is not 
envisaged for some reason, but offensive actions by the enemy 
are possible, or along maritime coastlines and on islands in 
operations as part of second echelons or reserves. 
  Subunits go over to the defensive in immediate contact with 
the enemy as part of covering forces or forces repelling his 
incursion at main or other advantageous defensive lines, in the 
repelling of counterattacks during an offensive, to consolidate 
lines taken, cover flanks or in an unfavorable outcome to a 
meeting engagement. 
  The defense is organized in such cases during the course of 
battle, and the subunits are subject to active enemy firepower. 
They will frequently have to repel his attacks as well. The 
preparation of emplacements and trenches at the forward edge 
using special engineer equipment is thus exceedingly 
problematical. Time to prepare the defense will moreover by very 
limited, and all issues will have to be resolved in a short 
time. Difficulties also arise in the creation of fire patterns, 
the organization of coordination, the placement of obstacles and 
the assurance of concealment, since the positions being prepared 
are under surveillance by the opposing side. 
  What are the decisive factors in the successful arrangement 
of defense? They are, first and foremost, the speed with which 
the commanders make the decision to go over to defense, and the 
selection of the methods of organizing it with a regard for the 
specific features of the concrete situation taking shape. The 
taking of immediate steps to counter enemy reconnaissance, and 
his attempts to subject them to fire and go over to the attack. 
The maintenance of continuous command and control, and timely 
reaction to changes in the situation. 
  It is particularly important to organize surveillance 
quickly, allocate alert-status firepower, camouflage vehicles 
and engineer structures, dig emplacements and put in minefields 
in concealed fashion. Advantageous sectors of terrain, its 
contours and natural obstacles--rows of hills, rivers, streams, 
canals, ravines, populated areas and embankments, among 
others--should also be utilized a widely as possible. 
  The contemporary defensive battle is typified by exceptional 
intensity, brought about by the determined nature of the aims of 
the opposing sides. An attacking enemy will constantly strive to 
augment his efforts to win success by bringing additional forces 
into battle and outflanking the defenders in order to attack 
them from the flanks and the rear. 
  Defense has become a highly dynamic type of battle as a 
consequence of the equipping of troops with vehicles and 
powerful weaponry. Rapid changes in the positions of the sides 
and the overall situation are entirely likely even when waging a 
static defense, not to mention a mobile one. The changes could 
moreover sometimes arise unexpectedly, especially at night, in 
rain or fog, in heavy snowfall and the like. 
  The involvement of various types of armored vehicles and 
helicopters on both sides is typical of modern combined-arms 
battle. The attackers will have primarily tanks interacting with 
motorized infantry, ground-attack aviation and helicopters as 
the basis of the strike forces. The helicopters, aside from 
supporting tanks, are able to drop airborne assaults and 
air-mobile forces in the rear of the defenders. This 
circumstance makes it essential to devote attention not only to 
repelling attacks from the front, but from the flanks and rear 
as well. The likelihood of the appearance of commando groups and 
the placement of reconnaissance and signaling gear in the depth 
of the defense should also not be ruled out. Camouflage and 
security, that is to say, cannot be neglected. 
  Contemporary defense combines the stubborn holding of 
important, key strongpoints by one portion of the forces and 
flexible maneuver by the other portion in order to create a 
reliable, all-round defense, especially when the threat of 
encirclement exists. The long range and recently increased 
accuracy of firepower have required the dispersion of battle 
formations. The problem of reliable coverage, by fire by and 
maneuver, of the increased intervals between neighboring 
positions, as well as the performance of maneuvers in the event 
of the threat of a breakthrough by the enemy between them, has 
consequently become more acute. 
  The widespread application of high-precision weaponry has 
become typical in an offensive, and the subunits could 
consequently suffer considerable losses. VTO is able to strike 
reliably not only visually observable targets (that is, those 
located on the line of combat contact of the sides), but also to 
destroy targets located in depth in the defense with no less 
effectiveness. Whence the increased requirements for the 
protection of troops and the stability of command and control. 
The task of maintaining communications has become more 
difficult, since wire lines could be disabled in the first 
minutes of battle, with radio communications suppressed by 
jamming. The creation of redundant channels, the provision for 
switching to other frequencies and the use of signals and mobile 
means have all gained particular urgency at the 
battalion--company--platoon levels. 
  Defense should be stable and active due to the equipping of 
foreign armies with highly effective vehicles and armaments, and 
be able to counter strikes by all types of weaponry, attacks by 
tanks and infantry and combat enemy airborne assaults and 
air-mobile and commando groups. It should be antitank, anti-air 
and anti-assault, echeloned in depth and ready for prolonged 
battle under conditions of the use of all types of weaponry, VTO 
and means of electronic warfare. The subunits are obligated to 
defend stubbornly the positions they occupy, even outside of 
tactical communications with their neighbors, as well as when 
encircled. They do not have the right to leave them and retreat 
without an order from the senior commander. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-67A>           Disposition of Battalion </FIG>





    Stability and vigor in defense are achieved through the 
endurance, steadfastness and stubbornness of the troops and 
their high moral spirit; continuous reconnaissance, the timely 
uncovering of enemy preparations for an offensive and the 
possible sectors for attacks; the careful camouflaging of the 
battle formation of the subunits and the confusing of the enemy 
pertaining to the arrangement of the defense, and operational 
intentions through their artful and varied arrangement. 
  These requirements are also met by the skilled use of 
advantageous conditions of the terrain and its engineer 
preparation, the careful organization of firing patterns 
(especially antitank in combination with systems of engineer 
obstacles, strongpoints and firing positions) and the creation 
of solid air defense. 
  The successful resolution of these tasks depends as well on 
the timely maneuvering of the subunits, firepower and fire to 
threatened sectors, and on the immediate destruction of an enemy 
that has penetrated along with his airborne assaults. Especially 
great significance is assigned to the use of unexpected tactics 
able to stun the enemy, put him in a difficult position and 
force one's own will and initiative onto him. 
  As for counterattacks, the experience of warfare shows that 
they are quite effective if they are carried out unexpectedly. 
They are expedient at the battalion level, meanwhile, only in 
conjunction with counterattacks carried out according to the 
plan of the senior commander. An independent decision to carry 
out a counterattack by a battalion commander is justified only 
if inconsiderable enemy forces have penetrated into the defense, 
and it is made with the permission of the brigade or regimental 
commander. 
<H5>  1.2. The Place and Role of Subunits in Defense </H5>
  The place of motorized-rifle and tank subunits in the 
defense 
is understood to mean their position in the order of battle of 
the troops. They engage in defense in the first or second 
echelon of the units (subunits), in the sector of concentration 
of their principal efforts or in another sector, comprising 
combined-arms and anti-assault reserves. 
  The battalion may defend in the forward defensive area by 
operating as a forward detachment, and in the creation of a 
forward position could receive the mission of defending it. 
Motorized-rifle and tank subunits are also involved in 
operations as armored groups and fire ambushes. The battalion 
may be designated as the rear guard in a disengagement and 
retreat from the battlefield, and the company as a rear or flank 
march security force to cover the main forces. 
  The first-echelon battalion of a brigade or regiment 
prepares 
and takes up the defensive in the first position in readiness to 
repel an attack in front of the forward edge or if it 
penetrates, as well as to hold an important area and create 
conditions for the defeat of the enemy. 
  The second-echelon battalion defends in the second position, 
as a rule in an important sector in readiness for the solid 
holding of the area occupied, for the reinforcement or 
replacement of subunits in the first echelon in the event they 
lose their fighting ability, and for the execution of 
counterattacks and the destruction of airborne assaults and 
air-mobile groups. 
  A tank battalion and motorized-rifle battalion in the second 
echelon in infantry fighting vehicles prepare one or two firing 
lines to repel enemy tanks and motorized-infantry by firing in 
place. The tank battalion of a motorized-rifle brigade or 
regiment is usually used to reinforce the motorized-rifle 
battalions, or is in the second echelon. The motorized-rifle 
battalion of a tank brigade or regiment is intended chiefly for 
the reinforcement of the tank battalions. It can also operate 
independently, taking up defense in the first position or in the 
forward defensive area (in a forward position). 
  A motorized-rifle or tank battalion allotted to the forward 
defensive area is given the task of restraining an attack by 
superior enemy forces, forcing him to deploy prematurely and 
attack in an unfavorable direction, inflict losses on him and 
gain time for the preparation of the defense. Subunits defending 
a forward position are given the task of confusing the enemy 
relative to the outlines of the forward edge of the defense, not 
permitting him to make a surprise attack on the subunits in the 
first echelon, repelling reconnaissance in force and forcing the 
premature deployment of the main forces. 
  The combined-arms reserve takes up the position indicated, 
conducts reconnaissance of airborne enemy forces, sets up 
anti-assault obstacles, and prepares fire ambushes in readiness 
to destroy airborne assaults in areas of possible landings and 
in likely sectors of their operations. 
  The first-echelon company of the battalion defends a 
strongpoint at the first and second trenches, fires on the enemy 
using all means and does not permit the breach of the forward 
line. The second-echelon company defends a strongpoint at the 
third (or fourth) trench, does not permit a breach of the first 
position and, when conditions are favorable, destroys attacking 
subunits that have penetrated the first and second trenches by 
counterattacks. The tank company (or motorized-rifle company in 
IFVs) moreover prepares one or two firing lines that could 
coincide with the lines of deployment for counterattack. 
  A motorized-rifle or tank platoon, as a rule, defends as 
part 
of a company. It may be positioned in the first or second 
echelon, at the center or on one of the flanks of its battle 
formation; in the concentration sector of the main forces or in 
another sector; it may be in battalion reserve, be assigned to 
combat security, an armored group, a combat reconnaissance 
patrol or a fire ambush. In retreat it may operate as rear or 
flank march security forces, and in disengagements as part of 
covering subunits and in screening forces. 
  The squad or tank defends as part of the platoon, as a rule. 
A tank, IFV or APC (the latter two without assault forces) may 
be assigned to operations as part of an armored group. With 
assault forces they can be part of fire ambushes. The tank or 
IFV may also be assigned as alert-status weapons, an 
alert-status vehicle or roving firepower. The squad or tank 
occupies a position (firing position) at the center or on one of 
the flanks of the platoon strongpoint. One squad takes up a 
position in depth 100-200 meters behind the trenches for the 
purpose of steadying the defense at the strongpoint of the 
motorized-rifle platoon defending in the most likely sector of 
enemy attack. 
  Subunits from other branches of the troops are attached to 
the motorized-rifle and tank subunits. A tank (motorized-rifle) 
company, artillery battalion or battery, subunit of antitank 
weapons, air-defense or engineer (up to a combat-engineer 
platoon) subunits, and sometimes a flamethrower platoon or 
company, may thus be attached to a motorized-rifle or tank 
battalion carrying out defense in the first echelon in the 
sector of concentration of the main efforts of the brigade or 
regiment. 
  A motorized-rifle company is reinforced with a mortar 
(artillery) battery, tank, antitank and grenade-launcher 
platoons, and combat-engineer and flamethrower squads. The tank 
company may receive an artillery battery, a motorized-rile 
platoon and a combat-engineer squad. A battalion or company in 
defense may also be supported by the fire of an artillery 
battalion or battery. 
  A motorized-rifle platoon may be reinforced with a 
grenade-launcher, antitank, flamethrower, air-defense and, 
sometimes, combat-engineer squads, chemical-warfare and 
reconnaissance troops and a tank. A tank platoon may receive a 
motorized-rifle squad. 
  The attached manpower and equipment usually take up a 
position in the battle formation where they are able to realize 
their combat capabilities with the greatest effectiveness, 
without disrupting the disposition of the principal subunit. 
  If the composition of a motorized-rifle battalion includes 
grenade-launcher and antitank subunits, they usually remain 
subordinate to the commander, operating in their full complement 
in support of the first echelon. An antitank platoon is used in 
a tank-hazardous section therein, to repel attacks by tanks and 
other armored vehicles, as well as to cover an open flank during 
counterattacks. It may be attached to companies in the first 
echelon on closed or rugged terrain. 
  The role of motorized-rifle and tank subunits in defense is 
determined by the combat mission and the place they occupy in 
the battle formation of the defending troops. Motorized-rifle or 
tank subunits, interacting with each other, with subunits of 
artillery and other branches of the troops and special troops, 
perform their principal mission for the immediate destruction of 
the enemy in close-range battle. The leading role in achieving 
victory belongs to them. 
  Motorized-rifle subunits, possessing a great deal of combat 
independence and universality, are able to perform the task of 
holding the areas, lines and positions they occupy, repel 
attacks by advancing troops and defeat them on various types of 
terrain and in any weather. Tank subunits, possessing great 
resistance to the destructive effects of nuclear and other types 
of weapons, create a reliable defense in the shortest possible 
time. They strengthen its vigor, and are able to counterattack 
effectively and destroy forces that have penetrated. 
  The role of motorized-rifle and tank subunits, at the same 
time, can be an equivocal one depending on their place in the 
battle formation. The subunits in the first echelon, defending 
in the sector of concentration of the main forces, are 
performing the most difficult tasks, since the stability of the 
defense as a whole depends on them. They fight the main enemy 
forces, repel their attacks and hold the sectors of terrain on 
which the outcome of the battle frequently depends. Subunits 
defending in another sector actually perform an auxiliary role. 
They keep the enemy in a constant state of tension, and 
undermine his maneuvers by means of their own vigorous actions. 
  The role of subunits can change in the course of various 
stages of the battle. The brunt of repelling an enemy attack, as 
has already been mentioned, falls to the lot of the first 
echelon. But if he penetrates into the defense and reaches 
positions in depth (to the second or third trenches in the first 
position or to the second position, for example), the outcome of 
the battle defends on the actions of the second echelon. The 
forces and weapons brought in to make counterattacks play the 
decisive role in carrying them out. The significance of the 
stubborn holding of the positions occupied by the subunits of 
the first echelon in the counterattack sector, however, is not 
reduced therein. 
  (To be continued) 
Footnote 
  1. Going over to defense by subunits at these lines during a 
period of threat is preceded by their advance preparation. The 
engineer preparation of the positions, and not only the 
organization of defense, are carried out in peacetime wherever 
possible (on proving grounds, areas where land is taken etc.).

Western Sector: How the Sector Main Commands Were Created and 
How They Functioned[.sup]1[/]"] 
  [Text] The 
article's author: Colonel General M. N. 
Tereshchenko--participant of the Great Patriotic War (from 
November 1941 to May 1945). During the war, company commander, 
battalion deputy commander, reconnaissance regiment chief, 
division staff operational department chief. Wounded twice in 
fighting with the fascists. Important positions in military 
district staffs and with the General Staff after the war. 
Regiment and division commander since 1954, chief of staff of 
the Baltic Military District since 1971, and chief military 
advisor and advisor to the minister of defense of the Syrian 
Arab Republic in 1974-1977. Chief of staff of the Belorussian 
Military District in 1977-1979, and then the first deputy chief 
of staff of the Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states. From 
September 1984 to October 1988, chief of staff and first deputy 
commander-in-chief of troops of the Western Sector. Presently 
retired. 
  "Dear Editor, 
  "Could you provide any information on the history of 
the establishment of the sector main commands, their missions 
and their fate? In the 1980's, the whole country knew about such 
sector main commands, but unfortunately the crazy secrecy in 
which our society was living deprived us of the most elementary 
official information. 
  "[signed] A. Palitsyn (Saratov)" 
  Major transformations consisting of a complex of measures 
were undertaken in the Soviet Armed Forces in the second half of 
the 1970's and in the early 1980's. The plan was to transform 
the main command of the ground forces into the directorate of 
the commander-in-chief's reserves, and to subordinate civil 
defense and the military commissariats to him; to establish 
sector main commands; to form separate army corps of brigade 
composition (as a resource for actions in the enemy's 
operational depth); to create air forces in the military 
districts while simultaneously eliminating air armies; to 
organize air defense on the territorial principle, where each 
military district would be responsible for air defense within 
its administrative boundaries. An attempt was made to draw a 
clearer dividing line between the functions of the General 
Staff, the main commands of the armed services, and sector 
troops and military districts. 
  This process was a long time in coming. The increasing scale 
and rate of military preparations by the opposing blocs--NATO 
and the Warsaw Pact, their creation of the latest resources of 
armed conflict, and chiefly for a first nuclear strike, as well 
as the desire of Western countries to break the 
military-strategic parity that had evolved by this time, 
motivated the Soviet leadership to take effective steps both to 
improve organizational structures and to fundamentally change 
the forms and methods of command and control. In the postwar 
years the activity of commanders and staffs in troop command and 
control continued to grow more complex. Command and control 
became the most important component of the combat readiness of 
troops and naval forces, and one of its decisive factors. This 
necessitated a constant search for effective ways to improve the 
entire system of command and control, especially of large troop 
(force) groupings in theaters of military operations (TMOs). 
  With regard for this, in September 1984 a new link of 
operational-strategic command and control of troops and naval 
forces--sector main commands--was brought into the command and 
control system. 
  The Soviet leadership undertook this action in retaliation 
to 
similar actions by the leadership of the NATO bloc. Back in the 
early 1950's the member nations of this bloc created coalitional 
elements of operational-strategic leadership of troops in 
Europe. In this case the Supreme Main Command in Europe assumed 
a central place in the overall system of the Joint Armed Forces 
of the NATO bloc. Its zone of responsibility included the 
territories of all of the bloc's European member nations (except 
Great Britain and Portugal) and Turkey, as well as the 
Mediterranean Sea. Three main commands of the Joint Armed Forces 
were established simultaneously: In the Northern European (a 
staff of up to 700 persons), Central European (up to 2,000 
persons) and Southern European (over 1,500 persons) 
TMOs.[.sup]2[/] 
  The block's leadership made a particular effort to train and 
set up command and control posts and to organize communications. 
The main commands were in a high state of readiness, and they 
could assume control over forces allocated to them in short 
time. Modern communication resources and automated command and 
control systems were present at control posts for this purpose. 
  Thus, the leadership of the NATO bloc managed to acquire 
certain advantages in troop command and control by this time, 
and it possessed a workable system of command and control for 
both peacetime and wartime. The Soviet Armed Forces were 
significantly behind NATO in this area (by more than 30 years in 
time, and hopelessly behind in organization and equipment). 
  The idea of transforming the system for controlling Soviet 
forces was based on the experience of the Great Patriotic 
War[.sup]3[/] and operational-strategic exercises. The 
process of creating the main sector commands in a sense went 
through two phases. 
  The first phase embraced the period from November 
1978 to September 1984. During this period the main commands 
were foreseen as coalitional elements of operational-strategic 
leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint Armed Forces 
of Warsaw Pact states in the Western and Southwestern TMOs, and 
only in wartime.[.sup]4[/] 
  The main commands owed their creation both to the essence 
itself and the complexity of the problem of providing for the 
collective security of Warsaw Pact states, and to the volume and 
rate of military preparations of the NATO bloc, as well as the 
nature of possible warfare. It was felt that without unified, 
centralized leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint 
Armed Forces at the scale of TMOs, it would be impossible to 
hope for success in war, were it to be initiated by the 
aggressor. 
  One of the forms of conducting military operations in a 
possible war--the TMO strategic operation, in which large troop 
(force) groupings of all armed services could participate--was 
theoretically recognized, and perfected in operational 
exercises. The organization and conduct of such an operation was 
an exceptionally complex and difficult task, requiring strict 
centralization of command and control of troops and naval 
forces. It was assumed that success in such an operation would 
be possible only on the condition that command and control of 
the troops (forces) was highly competent, efficient and unified, 
for which reason the elements of leadership had to be 
established ahead of time, while still at peace. 
  Considering this, the Staff of the Joint Armed Forces of 
Warsaw Pact states was adopted as the basis for establishment of 
main sector commands in the Western and Southwestern TMOs. It 
was transformed from a wartime military-political element into 
two operational-strategic elements of leadership of troops and 
naval forces in theaters of military operations. Establishment 
of a unified Supreme Main Command was foreseen for centralized 
leadership of these forces,[.sup]5[/] and the General Staff 
of the USSR Armed Forces became the command and control element. 
  The administration of the commander-in-chief of sector 
troops 
in a TMO consisted of deputy commanders representing each allied 
army, a staff, a political directorate and the following 
directorates: Missile forces and artillery, air forces, air 
defense troops, engineering and chemical troops, and armament 
and rear services. 
  The main element of command and control was the staff of the 
main command, headed by a chief of staff, who was also the first 
deputy commander-in-chief. Deputies representing each of the 
allied armies were foreseen under the chief of staff, as well as 
under the chief of the political directorate. The troop staff 
and all directorates were manned by generals, admirals and 
officers from all of the allied armies on a proportional basis, 
including generals and officers who served in the Staff of the 
Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states in peacetime. 
  Command and control of troops and air defense forces in the 
TMO was to be provided by a joint air force and air defense 
command post under the leadership of the air defense commander, 
who was also the deputy troop commander for the TMO. 
  The system for command and control of joint naval forces was 
organized on an entirely different basis. The commander of such 
naval forces became the deputy troop commander-in-chief for the 
TMO, and he essentially had to manage all of the naval forces. 
After all of the necessary documents were drawn up (regulations, 
basic missions and functional responsibilities, organizational 
structure), and the corresponding decisions were made, the main 
command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and 
the national commands and staffs embarked upon the practical 
work of forming the Western and Southwestern sector main 
commands. Much work was done in this aspect by the main command 
of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and 
primarily by Commander-in-Chief Marshal of the Soviet Union B. 
G. Kulikov and Joint Armed Forces Chief of Staff Army General A. 
I. Gribkov, by defense ministers, and by general and main staffs 
of the allied armies. It should be noted that 
operational-strategic exercises such as Soyuz, Granit and Shchit 
played a special role in this. They were conducted according to 
plans of the joint and national commands of the allied armies. 
  Exercise Soyuz-83 under the leadership of Marshal of the 
Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov was the most typical exercise of this 
scale. In it, the administration of the main command for the 
Western TMO was fully manned by generals and officers from four 
allied armies (the East German Army, the Polish Forces, the 
Czechoslovak Army and the Soviet Army) as well as from the Staff 
of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and the 
staffs of the fronts, armies, troops and naval forces were 
included. 
  These actions were approved by the leadership of all Warsaw 
Pact states, and they were made necessary, as was noted earlier, 
by the complexity of the military-political situation in Europe 
at this moment in time, and by the importance of the European 
theater of military operations in the plans of the North 
Atlantic bloc. It was difficult not to agree with such a step 
then. 
  However, for the sake of justice it should be emphasized 
that 
not all of this was taken to its logical conclusion. First of 
all, problems associated with the composition of the unified 
Supreme Main Command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw 
Pact states were not resolved, which had a negative effect on 
the solution of other problems. Nor can we ignore the special 
position taken by the Romanian leadership, which proposed an 
entirely different system of command and control of troops and 
naval forces in the theaters of military operations. 
  Back when the documents on the main commands were being 
drafted (chiefly the draft of the Regulations), the Romanian 
Ministry of National Defense, while not entirely rejecting the 
need for creating sector main commands for the Joint Armed 
Forces (in the TMOs), stated a special opinion, the essence of 
which reduced to the following: 

  -  The Political Consultative Committee should be the supreme 
main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact 
states, because only it is an authoritative body capable of 
carrying out major military-political tasks; 
  -  the main command of 
the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and not one of 
the general staffs of the allied armies should become the 
working element of the Supreme Main Command in wartime; 
  -  generals 
from each allied army serving in the rank of TMO first deputy 
commanders-in-chief had to be present under the 
commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO). Being a 
collective and coalitional element of leadership, the military 
council had to make the decisions on all of the basic questions 
of organizing and carrying out operations and controlling the 
troops; 
  -  the commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO) 
needed to control the troops through his first deputies from the 
allied armies, and through the military council, and not through 
the staff of the sectors troops. Only the first deputy 
commanders-in-chief had the right to issue directives, orders 
and instructions, and thus provide for troop command and 
control; 
  -  generals, admirals and officers from all allied armies 
needed to be appointed to positions of leadership in all of the 
directorates and departments, proportionately and on a rotating 
basis; 
  -  there was no need for creating a political directorate. 
Each country's party could carry out political work in the 
troops through its own political apparatus, in close cooperation 
with their armies. 

    Obviously, little more needs to be said about these 
conclusions, except that they clearly manifested the desire of 
the Romanians to dilute the main sector (TMO) command of the 
Joint Armed Forces, make it amorphous and incompetent, and in 
short, to remove national troops from its control. This was 
unacceptable. This is why the fundamental documents on the 
sector (TMO) main commands of the Joint Armed Forces were 
adopted by the Committee of Ministers of Defense and the 
Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact states 
without regard for the conclusions of the Romanian side. 
However, as a rule, during exercises and other operational 
measures these and other wishes of the Romanians were accounted 
for to the extent possible. 
  Such are the main landmarks in the first phase of 
establishment of the TMO main commands of the Joint Armed 
Forces. In my opinion this system of troop leadership satisfied 
the requirements of development of the Joint Armed Forces of the 
Warsaw Pact states in that situation. 
  The second phase embraces the period since 1984, 
when the Soviet leadership unilaterally, and contrary to 
decisions of the heads of Warsaw Pact states, raised to a 
practical plane the issue of creating sector main commands in 
peacetime, and only for Soviet troops. This decision was 
dictated -- besides by the arguments presented above -- by the 
Soviet Union's geopolitical position, the great dimensions of 
its territory, and the fact that the situation necessitated 
immediate improvement of troop leadership in the most important 
strategic sectors. It was felt in this case that creation of 
sector main commands would be a new important step forward on 
the road of development of the entire system of command and 
control of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, and would bring 
the leadership directly in touch with the troops, which would 
facilitate the command activities of the highest military bodies 
-- the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the USSR 
Armed Forces. 
  Thus, in September 1984 the main command of troops of the 
Western Sector was created and the composition of troops and 
naval forces subordinated to it was determined.[.sup]6[/] On 
24 September Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov assumed 
the position of the commander-in-chief of sector troops. A 
military council consisting of Chairman N. V. Ogarkov and the 
following council members was formed simultaneously: B. P. 
Utkin, the political directorate chief, the chief of staff -- 
the author of this article, and the first deputy 
commander-in-chief -- Army General M. I. Sorokin. The following 
deputy commanders-in-chief were designated as members of the 
military council later on: for air forces--Colonel General of 
Aviation S. V. Golubev, for armament--Lieutenant General A. A. 
Ivanov (as of 1985, deputy commander for combat training), and 
deputy commander for rear services--Lieutenant General G. P. 
Pastukhovskiy. 
  The following were subordinated directly to the troop 
commander-in-chief of the Western Sector: Two military districts 
(Belorussian and Carpathian), three groups of forces (the Group 
of Soviet Forces in Germany and the Central and Northern groups 
of forces); the following were operationally subordinated: The 
Baltic Fleet, one air army of the Supreme High Command and one 
air defense army (the 2d Separate Air Defense Army). The 
composition of the troop groupings and naval forces was 
approximately adequate to the NATO troop (force) groupings 
stationed in this sector. 
  By the nature of his position (but more in formal terms) the 
commander-in-chief of sector troops was endowed with full power 
of leadership over subordinated troops. He was given the 
responsibility of solving practically all problems associated 
with the life and activity of the troops: Ensuring the constant 
combat readiness of troops, naval forces and staffs; operational 
planning; organization of operational, combat and political 
training of troops and staffs; conduct of operational exercises, 
including with the participation of troops, fleets and staffs of 
the allied armies; implementation of measures to tighten 
military discipline, to provide material and technical support 
to the troops, and to establish operational materiel reserves; 
solution of problems concerning operational preparation of the 
TMO; creation of a system of communication, command and control. 
  The commander-in-chief of sector troops resolved the issues 
of operational planning and joint exercises that concerned the 
allied troops through the General Staff of the USSR Armed 
Forces, and coordinated directly with the military leadership of 
the allied countries (in the West--with the general staffs of 
the Polish Forces, the Czechoslovak Army and the main staff of 
the East German Army). 
  Such a broad declaration of the rights of the 
commander-in-chief of sector troops did not enjoy any practical 
support. The difficulty was that the center (represented by the 
main commands of the armed services) did not want to concede its 
unshared leadership of troops and forces subordinated to it 
(this was manifested especially strongly by the main commands of 
the air forces and air defense forces). The intermediate 
link--the military districts (groups of forces)--felt that the 
sector main command would usurp their authority in many issues, 
and therefore they did not wish to have this intermediate 
element of command and control above them. As far as the 
leadership of the armies and divisions is concerned, it 
expressed gratitude for the work of officers of the main command. 
  Note that for practical purposes nothing changed at that 
time 
in the work of the main commands of the armed services and the 
staffs of the military districts and groups of forces; the 
entire system that had been honed over the years remained in 
place. The leadership of the military districts (groups of 
forces) not only retained the right of direct communication with 
the minister of defense, the General Staff and the main commands 
of the armed services, but it was even encouraged. Still, the 
range of issues that had to be resolved through the sector main 
commands was clearly defined. This was also reinforced by the 
fact that all problems of material support and personnel issues 
were resolved centrally, chiefly in the administrations of the 
main commands of the armed services. 
  All of this led to parallelism in work, and to reduction of 
the role of sector main commands and the main commands of the 
armed services. This practice automatically created conditions 
for various conflicts. 
  Strange as it may seem, with the appearance of the sector 
main commands the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the 
Warsaw Pact states, which was one of the initiators in creation 
of sector main commands, began doing everything it could to 
block their contact with the leadership of allied armies. This 
position had a negative effect on the work in general. And the 
General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces had not developed clear 
directives regarding this matter by this time, occupying a kind 
of dualistic position in relation to the new elements of command 
and control. Nor did creation of these sector main commands have 
the needed impact as a retaliatory measure to the military 
preparations of the NATO bloc, as the leadership of the USSR 
Ministry of Defense simply hushed up their existence. 
  None of this provided for normal work. 
  At that time the administration of the sector main command 
included: A staff consisting of operational, naval, intelligence 
and organizational-mobilizational directorates, a communications 
directorate, and the following departments -- ECM, topographic, 
political, troop services, special services, supply, financial 
and others; directorates: missile forces and artillery, air 
forces, air defense forces, combat training, political, 
engineering and chemical troops, armament and rear services; a 
construction inspectorate, a messing inspectorate; a financial 
service; communications, security and support units. 
  In this variant the staff of the main command of sector 
troops was the main element of command and control. It carried 
the responsibility for the entire volume of tasks determined for 
a main command, and in addition: Evaluating the 
military-political situation, organizing reconnaissance, 
developing proposals on the mobilizational readiness of troops 
and on improving their organizational and staffing structure, 
organizing troop services, creating and improving the 
communications and command and control systems in the TMO, 
supporting the conduct of operational training and exercises, 
performing monitoring functions, and studying, generalizing and 
bringing progressive experience and new training methods and 
techniques to the awareness of the troops. 
  The chief of staff provided leadership to the work of the 
staff of the main command of sector troops. (He was also the 
first deputy commander-in-chief and a member of the military 
council). He had the right to issue orders on behalf of the 
commander-in-chief to subordinated troops, and he coordinated 
the activity of all elements of command and control. The chief 
of staff personally participated in solving the most important 
problems pertaining to troop combat readiness, operational 
planning, exercises and training. Establishing and maintaining 
close business contacts with the leadership of the general 
staffs of allied armies was a special concern of the chief of 
staff. And there were many difficulties in this area. 
  A political directorate headed by Lieutenant General V. P. 
Utkin, deputy chief of the Main Political Directorate of the 
Soviet Army and Navy, was formed to organize and coordinate 
political work in the troops and Navy. The political directorate 
was granted the rights of an element of leadership, which was 
not received well by the political directorates of the armed 
services and military districts (groups of forces). 
  This structure of the administration of the main command 
(numbering 500 persons) was believed to be fully acceptable for 
carrying out its tasks. But it must be recognized that the 
administration of the main command of the Western Sector was 
created in haste, for all intents and purposes between September 
and October 1984, while its overall establishment proceeded in 
two phases: September-December 1984, during which time it was 40 
percent manned, and from 1 March 1985, when it was manned to its 
full complement. 
  The staff directorates were headed by experienced generals 
such as Lieutenant General V. G. Maganov (operational), Vice 
Admiral P. F. Sharov (naval), Lieutenant General V. A. Kartashov 
(intelligence), Lieutenant General P. F. Ponomarev 
(organizational-mobilizational), Lieutenant General G. F. Mishin 
(communications directorate). Lieutenant General D. G. 
Shkrudnev, a participant of combat operations in Afghanistan, 
became the first deputy chief of staff. 
  The missile forces and artillery directorate was headed by 
Lieutenant General N. A. Mikhaylov, the air defense forces 
directorate was headed by Lieutenant General V. V. Litvinov, and 
the air force staff was headed by Lieutenant General of Aviation 
M. M. Kuznetsov. 
  On the whole, the directorates and departments of the main 
commands were staffed by experienced, well-trained generals, 
admirals and officers. These were specialists in their areas, 
who possessed considerable practical work experience in their 
corresponding positions. 
  Nonetheless, mistakes were made in personnel. Many officers 
came up from positions at division and army scale, did not have 
work experience in higher staffs, and knew little about the 
peculiarities of the Western TMO. These and other mistakes 
necessarily impacted upon the style and results of the work, 
especially during initial establishment of the main command's 
administration. The desire of the leadership to immediately 
begin practical work in the forces, without any kind of 
preparatory period, also had a negative effect. After all, every 
officer needed time to assimilate his functional 
responsibilities and the peculiarities of the life of the 
troops, and to study the peculiarities of the theater of 
military operations. 
  Direct work in the troops, in the Navy and in the staffs was 
the principal method of leadership of the main command and of 
the administration as a whole. The work was organized on a 
principled but benevolent basis, and it was oriented on 
fulfilling the requirements of directives (orders) of the 
minister of defense and the General Staff of the armed forces. 
The principle of teaching the troops what they needed in war was 
introduced into troop and staff training practice for real. 
  I feel it my duty to give credit in this regard to the 
ability and tactfulness of the troop commander-in-chief of the 
Western Sector, Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov. Being 
one of the initiators of creating the sector main commands, he 
invested a great deal of work into forming and initially 
developing the administration of the main command of troops of 
the Western Sector. Possessing a broad outlook, a knack for 
creative operational thinking, considerable experience in the 
troops and work experience in higher positions, he was able to 
teach commanders and staffs patiently and objectively. And not 
only teach them but also to demand the same kind of relationship 
to subordinates on the part of generals and officers of the 
administration of the main command, requiring them to provide 
specific assistance to subordinates locally. 
  This practice and style of work made it possible to reach 
one 
of the objectives--bringing the leadership directly in touch 
with the troops. In this aspect the sector's main command became 
for practical purposes the executive element of the central 
leadership in the forces. The leadership of the Ministry of 
Defense only needed to rely a little more actively on it, which 
is something it did not do in practice. Advances were also made 
in reaching the objective of improving the system of command, 
control and communications in the TMO, which was practically 
nonexistent at that time. It had to be created anew. 
  Under these conditions it was extremely important to 
maintain 
firm control, guaranteed to be reliable, over the men and 
equipment of air defense and air forces in the TMO. 
  In this connection it was believed that air defense should 
be 
organized within the TMO (within the sector) on the territorial 
principle, assigning responsibility for its organization within 
the boundaries of the TMO to the commander-in-chief of sector 
troops (by this act, a new level of authority was introduced to 
assume responsibility over air defense); and within the 
boundaries of the military district, to the corresponding 
district troop commander. This was recognized to be a more 
flexible, dependable and easily controllable system, capable of 
successfully carrying out its missions. 
  However, it was impossible to carry out all of the plans in 
their full volume, because soon after, the entire air defense 
system was once again rigidly centralized under the sole 
leadership of the commander-in-chief of air defense forces. 
  And so, radical reforms of a major scale were not carried 
out 
in the Army and Navy in those years--the conservatism of the 
center prevailed. Almost all organizational measures carried out 
in the armed forces, mentioned at the beginning of this article, 
were rescinded, and everything was pushed back to square one. 
This was a huge mistake. Before dismantling the organisms that 
had evolved and been perfected by the second half of the 1970's, 
a fully adequate replacement for them should have first been 
prepared. Paradoxical though this may be, this is precisely what 
was absent. The dismantling of many structures that took decades 
to evolve, often hastily, with major mistakes and without 
adequate foresight, did harm to the Army and Navy. Their 
development was set back many years. 
  The almost simultaneous replacement of the leadership of the 
sector main commands and numerous reductions of their numerical 
strength, as well as recision of direct subordination of 
military districts (groups of forces) to them transformed the 
administrations of the main commands into formal elements of 
leadership in subsequent years. And with the disintegration of 
the strategic grouping of Soviet and allied forces in Eastern 
Europe, the administration of the main command of forces of the 
Western Sector was abolished. 
  I feel that it would be pertinent to cite here one of the 
statements made in this regard by Marshal of the Soviet Union S. 
F. Akhromeyev. In 1991, assessing the suitability of creating 
sector main commands, he said: "Main commands of sector troops 
were not created before the start of the Great Patriotic War, 
but all attempts to create them during the war ended in failure. 
It is too difficult, and practically impossible, to create such 
a large element of operational-strategic command and control and 
the corresponding contingent of administrative forces for it 
when already at war. Our opponents demanded immediate 
dismantling of both the structure and the system of command and 
control of the armed forces, including the main commands of 
sector troops (emphasis mine.--M. T.). ...The system for 
the country's postwar security, upon which so much energy and 
resources had been expended by our people, 
collapsed."[.sup]7[/] Such is the bitter conclusion. 
  In may be said in conclusion that being a new form of 
leadership of troops and naval forces in peacetime, the sector 
main commands were felt to be fully capable of carrying out 
their missions, and they doubtlessly played a certain positive 
role. 
  What was negative in this was, obviously, the fact that the 
sector main commands were created in the absence of a deep 
assessment of the military-political situation, in haste, and of 
course, without adequate foresight. Their operation over the 
course of approximately eight years turned out to be an 
expensive measure, even for those times. 
  The imposition of a wide range of tasks upon the sector main 
command, with emphasis on the functions of controlling the 
military district, and the unjustified demands for fulfilling 
these tasks dispersed the efforts of the leadership and 
distracted it from more-objective execution of the main tasks. 
The low manning of the organizational structure, which was more 
than anything a copy of the administrative staff of the military 
district, and not even of the Group of Forces in Germany of that 
period, was no help either. 
  Presence of such intermediate elements of troop leadership 
in 
peacetime (in the 1970's-1980's) may have been more effective 
had the rights and responsibilities in relation to subordinated 
troops been truly complete and harmoniously interrelated. In 
order to carry out all of the assigned tasks of leadership of 
troops and naval forces, the administration of the main command 
had to be larger in structure and operational composition, 
especially in the Western Sector (an example would be the main 
command of NATO Joint Armed Forces). 
  The growing rate and scale of the present military reform 
and 
development of a new Russian Army as the heir to the best 
traditions of the Russian Army and Navy require new qualities on 
the part of command and control elements, ones which would 
encourage them to continually improve the style, forms and 
methods of command activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Major Vadim Kinshin: "Advanced Maneuverability </F>
Fighter"] 
  [Text] Interest in raising the maneuvering 
characteristics of warplanes persists abroad. The military 
departments of the USA and Germany are conducting joint research 
on a number of aviation programs for the future. A program to 
design a tactical fighter with advanced maneuverability (EFM) 
occupies a special place. Series X airplanes are the first 
experimental models. 
  A joint international simulation exercise was carried out in 
1985 to evaluate the influence of maneuvering qualities on a 
fighter's combat effectiveness, especially in close combat. 
  Research was conducted within the program with regard for 
present trends in combat use of fighter aviation and air defense 
resources. This is associated with the fact that significant 
changes occurred in the last 10 years in the homing heads of all 
types of missiles. The sensitivity of homing heads and their 
scanning angles were subjected to modernization primarily. 
Requirements on the tactics of aerial combat, especially close 
combat, have risen: The modern fighter must have "tactical 
freedom"--that is, it must maintain its advantages until the 
absolute end of combat. However, for the time being we can 
observe a different picture--more than half of the "one on one" 
contests end in mutually observed missile launchings, or in 
other words, the potential destruction of one another. 
  In the opinion of foreign military specialists high-speed 
flight remains the best means of defense, because the commonly 
accepted trends in development and use of fighters have 
"wallowed at low speeds." Experts feel that it is only 
theoretically that a decrease in speed makes it possible to 
change a fighter's trajectory or maneuvering mode. In fact, an 
airplane's inertia does not change when it carries out maneuvers 
at high angles of attack, while its aerodynamic control becomes 
weak. As a result the possibilities for completing a maneuver 
quickly are limited. 
  Foreign specialists see passive inertial flight at a speed 
of 
around Mach 0.9 in particular sections of the trajectory to be 
one of the solutions to this problem. This approach makes it 
possible for a fighter to reduce flying distance while 
maneuvering, and to complete maneuvers faster. Forestalling the 
opponent in this fashion, the airplane can assume a more 
advantageous position for effective use of onboard weapons. Its 
kill capability will increase due to reduction of firing range.

  Two X-31A fighters were the first models of aircraft of this 
type. The airplane's configuration recalls that of the F-18 
fighter. The X-31A has a swept-back fuselage with flat side 
walls, low wings and a vertical tail fin welded to the fuselage. 
The engine's air intake has a movable lower edge, and it is 
located beneath the fuselage. According to design calculations 
this is the variant that permits the fighter to operate in 
optimum fashion at large angles of attack. Forward horizontal 
control surfaces--for pitch control and balancing of the craft's 
airframe--may be said to be yet another unique feature of the 
airplane's design. 
  The flight control devices of the X-31A are of the 
conventional variety. Presence of a group of three large vanes 
mounted near the jet engine nozzle is an identifying structural 
feature. They are intended for fast and precise deflection of 
the main direction of the jet stream by changing part of its 
flow in the needed direction. In this case the vanes keep the 
engine's thrust factor at its maximum. They are capable of 
increasing the total deflection of the main exhaust flow by more 
than 10 degrees, which makes it possible to obtain up to 17 
percent additional thrust energy in any selected direction. 
Consequently the pilot may quickly change flight direction, and 
maneuver without resorting to the assistance of conventional 
control devices. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-76A>           Variant of a Maneuver by the X-31A to </FIG>




  The wing structure is of certain interest. The wings are 
flexed in the vertical plane, and they narrow at the tips. Good 
aerodynamic qualities of the wings, especially at large angles 
of attack both at sub- and supersonic speeds, have been noted on 
several occasions in tests. The flat side walls of the fuselage 
made it possible to achieve reasonable characteristics during 
slip. 
  On the basis of maneuverability requirements the X-31A has a 
"load ratio" (the ratio of a loaded engine to thrust) of not 
less than 1:1. In addition the aircraft may be flown on the 
basis of flight control system data, while the layout of the 
fighter makes it possible to utilize full engine power even at 
angles of attack of 70 degrees. The high maneuvering qualities 
of the airplane are associated with presence of forward control 
surfaces. Tests showed that at large angles of attack in 
subsonic flight, a critical moment arises at which the center of 
gravity shifts toward the tail or nose of the fighter--it 
becomes unstable, and can spontaneously stall. It is to preclude 
this that the forward control surfaces are used. 
  Research conducted under the program revealed that owing to 
its advanced maneuverability, the X-31A can quickly assume a 
stable position while performing any dangerous maneuver, upon 
entering into a protracted stall, when the engine fails, or when 
the thrust control system breaks down. This is how higher flight 
safety of the X-31A in comparison with other fighters is 
accomplished. 
  There is one unique feature of the fighter's control: Flight 
control is linked to engine thrust control. Consequently the 
principal means of flight control is automatic, using the flight 
control system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-77A>           Variant of a Maneuver </FIG>




  Certain changes were made in the controls and displays in 
connection with the fighter's new possibilities. There is an 
additional switch on the joystick allowing the pilot to cause 
the aircraft to stall or return to ordinary flight. An 
additional piloting mark is projected onto the heads-up display. 
Its purpose is to indicate and warn the pilot of the real 
angular position of the airplane in space and its subsequent 
oblique displacements in the course of stall maneuvers. Tests 
showed that the peculiarities of control of the X-31A favorably 
affect the results of aerial combat, because it is hard for the 
opponent to predict the airplane's trajectory. In addition, 
stalling during combat makes it possible to more than double the 
number of missiles launched, and thus quadruple the fighter's 
firepower. In turn, the combat exchange factor rises by 160 
percent to a ratio of 1:3 in favor of the X-31A. A 15 percent 
increase in the airplane's mobility reduces losses to air 
defense fire by 75 percent. 
  New structural concepts and results of tests on the advanced 
maneuverability fighter encouraged further development of this 
concept. Thus America's Grumman developed a similar fighter, the 
X-29A, with forward-swept wings. Flight tests demonstrated the 
airplane's high maneuvering qualities: At angles of attack of 
25-40 degrees its speed of descent was minimal, and it made a 
complete turn in a radius of 350-400 meters. Control of the 
direction of engine thrust has also been reflected in a fighter 
of a totally different type--the STOVL short take-off and 
landing aircraft. According to reports in the foreign press it 
will have an improved aerodynamic shape and built-in thrust 
control. 
  The concept of advanced maneuverability of tactical fighters 
is now being used abroad as the basis of active efforts to 
design an airplane capable of changing its length while in 
flight.

<F P=106> [Article by Rodion Morozov: "General Grachev's First </F>
Ring of Defense"] 
  [Text] Of all our defense 
ministers, the current one-- General of the Army Pavel 
Grachev--is doubtlessly the most criticized. He is criticized 
for anything and everything. For example, for allegedly 
surrounding himself in two years as head of the military 
department with people knowing less than little about the army 
and its problems. And distancing himself from the army, 
stretching relations with real military professionals to the 
breaking point. The accusation is extremely serious; if of 
course it isn't unsubstantiated. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA received brief 
dossiers from sources in the Ministry of Defense on 
"confidential advisors" within Pavel Grachev's inner circle. 
  VALERIY LAPSHOV. The number one man in Pavel Grachev's 
circle 
is what Lieutenant-General Valeriy Lapshov, director of his 
administration, is called. Prior to 1991 45-year-old Valeriy 
Mikhaylovich Lapshov was an unpromising senior operations 
officer in the Second Directorate of the General Staff's GOU 
(Main Operational Directorate), without any ambitions for the 
future. This is what he was, and most probably this is what he 
would have remained, had he not had the luck to study earlier in 
the Academy of the General Staff [AGSh] together with Pavel 
Grachev. Soon after the August coup, Grachev, who was then still 
the first deputy to Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov in the Union Defense 
Ministry, assumed his first command. For practical purposes 
Colonel Lapshov became a Major-General right away, in November 
of the same year, and two years later he was promoted to 
Lieutenant-General. (According to available information the 
question of promoting Lapshov to Colonel-General was also 
raised. However, Colonel-General Valeriy Mironov, Pavel 
Grachev's deputy, who handled personnel issues at that time, 
stated his categorical opposition. Such a high rank did not 
correspond to the position occupied by Lapshov.) 
  According to friends an unusually gregarious, communicative 
person and a fabulous organizer of parties, Lapshov could not 
but be a soul mate to Pavel Grachev, no less gregarious than the 
former. 
  As director of the Minister's Administration, Lapshov 
possesses extremely significant power. Practically all documents 
requiring the minister's attention go through his hands. It's 
his decision whether they end up on Grachev's desk or get tossed 
into the waste basket. Access to the Minister is also through 
Lapshov. 
  DMITRIY KHARCHENKO. After graduating from the Academy of the 
General Staff, Major-General Kharchenko was appointed commander 
of a division. But the division commander's career was not a 
long one. He was unexpectedly appointed to the position of Chief 
of the General Staff's International Treaty Directorate. He had 
never been a lawyer or a diplomat, but like Lapshov he studied 
together with Grachev. To add to this, he was lucky enough to 
establish family ties with the General of the Army: This summer 
his daughter married one of the Minister's sons. 
  Recently, the quickly advancing Lieutenant-General 
Kharchenko 
was appointed deputy chief of the General Staff. Even though he 
had no right to such an appointment on the basis of his 
position--chief of an ordinary directorate. (The directors of 
key main directorates, such as the Main Operational Directorate, 
the Main Organizational and Mobilizational Directorate, the Main 
Intelligence Directorate could have been deputy chiefs of the 
General Staff). But of course it's easy to correct this 
shortcoming: There are plans for raising the directorate headed 
by Kharchenko to the status of a main directorate, and to 
promote him to Colonel-General. 
  GENADIY IVANOV. Not long ago the chief of the Directorate of 
Military Development and Reforms, Lieutenant-General Genadiy 
Ivanov was a group leader in the Center for Operational and 
Strategic Research--a body that has now been eliminated in view 
of its absolute uselessness. From there, he was sent for 
training to the AGSh, where he became acquainted with Pavel 
Grachev and Valeriy Lapshov. After graduating from the academy 
he remained there as an instructor. But not for long: Genadiy 
Ivanov rode the crest of the wave of the "August Victory" into 
the Russian president's administration and concurrently into the 
Defense Ministry's administration. After that, Ivanov 
transferred permanently to the Ministry of Defense, where he 
hammered together an army reform group in the fastest possible 
time. Then just as quickly he "grew" the group into the 
Directorate of Military Development and Reform. All matters 
associated with the army's reform are under his exclusive 
control. It is through him, and not through the "brains" from 
the General Staff, as was done before, that all necessary 
decisions of the minister pass. 
  SERGEY ZDORIKOV. Major General Zdorikov studied together 
with 
Grachev, and he was recently appointed to the position of chief 
of the Directorate for Work With Personnel. He is a regular 
political worker who graduated from the Political Academy. While 
studying in the AGSh he proved himself to be an extremely 
undisciplined student. He rarely attended classes, as a result 
of which he was in perpetual friction with the group leader, 
Grachev. Now the relations between the "leader" and Zdorikov 
have normalized. 
  VLADIMIR NIKITIN. Major General Nikitin, chief of the 
Affairs 
Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, is within the leadership 
of the military department, and a very mysterious figure. 
Ill-wishers have this to say about him: "Nikitin? Oh, before he 
was promoted to general he never commanded a troop grouping any 
larger than two typists!" A lawyer by education, Vladimir 
Nikolayevich Nikitin came to the Main Personnel Directorate as a 
civilian employee. And it was there that he became a lieutenant, 
upon joining military service voluntarily. After this he was 
transferred from the Main Personnel Directorate to, of all 
things, the Main Intelligence Directorate. He served there to 
the rank of captain, and once again returned to the Main 
Personnel Directorate, where he was promoted to major. Then the 
August coup occurred. Nikitin spent the "three black days" in 
the White House, from which he moved to a position in the State 
Legal Administration under the RF president. From there, 
traveling the road from major to major general in a single year 
(!)--Nikitin received his general's rank by an edict from USSR 
President Gorbachev. He returned once again to the Ministry of 
Defense, where he assumed his former position--chief of the 
Affairs Directorate; a position which, in view of its unique 
features, could be occupied only by a person known to be 
"especially trustworthy." 
  YELENA AGAPOVA and VLADIMIR KOSAREV. Ministry press 
secretary 
Yelena Agapova and chief of the Directorate of Information and 
the Press Major General Vladimir Kosarev finish off the list of 
closest advisors. 
  Before joining the Ministry of Defense Yelena Aleksandrovna 
Agapova worked around 30 years with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, where she 
climbed the career ladder from editorial messenger to assistant 
editor-in-chief. An accident decided her fate in the Ministry of 
Defense. It was March 1993, deputies of the RF Supreme Soviet 
invited Grachev to attend a hearing, where the defense minister 
was to give a report on the status of the Russian Armed Forces. 
As the appointed day came closer, Grachev became increasingly 
gloomier: The report, which had been drafted by military 
specialists and which contained a mass of "sticky issues," could 
create an undesirable impression. It was then that Yelena 
Aleksandrovna came to the rescue. Literally in one night she 
managed to tailor the "explosive" text in such a way that by 
morning the General of the Army not only survived but even 
earned the applause of the deputies. Having become confident in 
the abilities of his press secretary, Grachev elevated her to 
the rank of an advisor to the ministry and instructed her to 
form her own staff, for which 12 officers slots were foreseen. 
After completing this task as well, Agapova petitioned to 
establish a new subdivision under the Ministry--the Directorate 
of Information and the Press. Vladimir Kosarev, also an 
assistant editor-in-chief of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, became its chief. 
What we know about Vladimir Grigoryevich is that he had no 
military education at all, and that prior to August 1991 he 
worked with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as deputy director of the propaganda 
division. After the coup he wound up in the president's 
administration, from which he returned to a higher position with 
the same newspaper. 
  In the ministry, Vladimir Kosarev is "Agapova's man": He 
does 
not resolve a single issue of even the slightest importance 
without her knowledge and consent -- even selecting information 
coming together in his directorate and the means of its 
transmission to the minister. 
  Such is the appearance of General of the Army Pavel 
Grachev's 
"first ring of defense." The editor's office feels evaluation of 
its reliability to be a matter for military specialists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, Russian </F>
Federation first deputy minister of defense, by Pavel 
Felgengauer, date, place and occasion not specified, under 
rubric "Opinions": "Andrey Kokoshin: Russian Army Is Preparing 
for Local Wars and Antiterrorist Activity"] 
  [Text] Andrey Kokoshin is first deputy minister of 
defense of the Russian Federation. He was born in 1945 and 
completed Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman in 1969. 
He has an electronics engineering diploma and is a doctor of 
historical sciences, professor, and USSR (Russian) Academy of 
Sciences corresponding member. He is the author (or coauthor) of 
12 books on problems of international relations, military 
strategy, and questions of arms limitation and disarmament. For 
a number of years he held the post of deputy director of the 
USSR Academy of Sciences USA and Canada Institute and deputy 
chairman of the Committee of Soviet Scientists. At the same time 
(as is true of many other associates of the USSR Academy of 
Sciences), he took part in a number of projects financed by the 
Ministry of Defense, particularly in developing the "asymmetric" 
Soviet response (familiar from Gorbachev's words) to the U.S. 
SDI Program. 
  In April 1992 Kokoshin was appointed first deputy 
minister of defense of Russia simultaneously with General 
Grachev (duties of Russian Federation minister of defense were 
being performed at that time by President Yeltsin personally). 
The "Democratic Russia" movement, influential at that time, 
tried hard for (and achieved) the appointment of a civilian 
specialist to a leadership position in the Ministry of Defense. 
By the way, Andrey Afanasyevich himself has not taken part in 
quarrels of recent years and is not directly linked with a 
single political movement. 
  In the Ministry of Defense Kokoshin above all handles 
questions of military-technical development and relations with 
the military-industrial complex. 
  [SEGODNYA] As a Ministry of Defense representative, you 
took part in organizing the successful operation in the North 
Caucasus in December of last year which ended with the freeing 
of captured hostages, the helicopter and its crew, arrest of the 
terrorists and return of the bulk of the ransom paid to them. 
Tell me, was the Army's participation in antiterrorist 
operations an improvisation? To what extent was everything 
planned in advance? 
  [Kokoshin] In principle, hostage-taking is a 
regular situation for the MVD and other security services, not 
for the Armed Forces. And they played the leading role in this 
operation, but the Ministry of Defense was immediately drawn 
into it inasmuch as the bandits demanded a military helicopter 
with crew. As first deputy minister of defense, I was included 
in the state commission, which as you know was headed by First 
Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Minister of Defense General of the 
Army Pavel Grachev gave directions for using any necessary Armed 
Forces assets to assist MVD entities in conducting this 
operation. A three-level crisis management system was 
established: 1) an interdepartmental commission at the level of 
the first and second persons of the Ministry of Defense, MVD, 
FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service], FAPSI [Federal Agency 
for Government Communications and Information], Ministry of 
Health and others, which worked for three days in Soskovets' 
office; 2) operations staffs in each of the departments 
participating in the operation, including a special operations 
team on the General Staff and in the Main Commissariat of the 
Air Force; 3) and an operations staff in Mineralnyye vody headed 
by General Chebotarev from the MVD. Lieutenant General Vladimir 
Mikhaylov, 4th Air Army commander, was appointed Chebotarev's 
deputy. He was almost constantly in contact with the abductors. 
The fliers--pilot Valentin Padalka (squadron commander, Military 
Unit 32982) and navigator Vladimir Stepanov (flight 
pilot-navigator, Military Unit 32982) were from his army and he 
of course felt responsible for them both from a human standpoint 
and out of duty. Commander-in-Chief Air Force Colonel General of 
Aviation Petr Deynekin was at his post around the clock. The 
fliers, from the CinC to the ordinary pilot, demonstrated their 
traditional cohesiveness. 
  [SEGODNYA] How do you assess the level of coordination 
of actions of different departments in this operation? 
  [Kokoshin] The Armed Forces conducted a kind of 
forced exercise within the scope of the overall operation. It 
must be said that in the final account good coordination of all 
branches and combat arms of the Armed Forces, Internal Security 
Forces, militia, and security entities managed to be achieved. 
General Mikhaylov and the North Caucasus Military District 
command functioned excellently. But the main burden of the 
operation fell on the shoulders of internal affairs entities. 
  There were of course also rough spots in coordination and in 
work in outlying areas, but our comrades in arms, including 
First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs General Yegorov, a 
most experienced person in these matters, assessed the level of 
mutual understanding very highly. To a considerable extent this 
was a result of the very effective work style of Oleg Soskovets, 
head of the interdepartmental commission, and of constant 
support on the part of the president and prime minister. 
  The criminals' very first steps permitted us to determine 
with a high degree of probability that they were not planning to 
fly to Iran, but still the government contacted Iranian 
authorities through Ministry of Foreign Affairs channels, and 
they were ready to receive the terrorists in accordance with 
requirements of international law. 
  Several possible landing areas in the North Caucasus were 
computed based on the helicopter's capabilities and an analysis 
of operational data received in various ways. Up to 49 different 
radars were operating in the region to track the helicopter with 
the abductors in the concluding phase of the operation. Ground 
Troops mobile SAM system radars capable of detecting low-flying 
targets were activated as well, but ground radars sometimes lost 
the helicopter in folds of mountainous relief difficult for 
radar operation. Then the decision was made, probably for the 
first time in world practice of such operations, to bring in two 
A-50 radar early-warning aircraft (similar to the U.S. E-3A of 
the AWACS system). By the way, only two countries in the world, 
the United States and Russia, presently possess such means with 
high characteristics of their own development and production. By 
this time the ground radars, tied into a unified system, also 
began to work more effectively. 
  This system operated intermittently in the initial moment of 
radar tracking of the helicopter. The A-50 aircraft were moved 
from another region with an entirely different terrain relief, 
and the operators initially had a difficult time. Coordination 
among all radar monitoring crews was not adjusted right away, 
but in the final account a reliable system for monitoring air 
space in the region managed to be created through joint efforts 
of the Air Force, Air Defense Troops, and the North Caucasus 
Military District command, and not once during the last flight 
from Mineralnyye vody to Makhachkala did the A-50's, ground 
radars and specially scrambled interceptors lose "sight" of the 
helicopter with the criminals aboard. And this was done in very 
short time periods under standards of the armed forces of any 
country. The helicopter repeatedly descended to a height of 50 m 
and lower at the criminals' demand. They took extreme risks, and 
only the supreme expertise and courage of "Afghan" Lieutenant 
Colonel Valentin Padalka and his partner saved everyone from 
perishing. 
  Air defense fighters and the attack aircraft brought in for 
the operation had high-intensity illumination flares aboard 
which could facilitate a search for the criminals at night. 
Necessary aircraft weapons also were ready. By the way, 
everything was prepared to the maximum extent to seal off all 
possible landing areas by personnel of Internal Security Forces 
and the militia, and several Airborne Troops "Spetsnaz" teams 
were in full readiness (with helicopters). On the whole, forces 
had been assembled which would have established a double cordon. 
  As a result, not only were the children freed and criminals 
arrested, but a large part of the ransom also was returned. 
  [SEGODNYA] How new is a helicopter hijacking situation 
in world practice? 
  [Kokoshin] According to information received, 
including from foreign agencies through the Foreign Intelligence 
Service, helicopter hijackings are a relative "innovation" of 
terrorists, and so responding actions by law-protection agencies 
have not been worked out hardly at all in world practice 
compared with experience in the case of aircraft hijackings. 
  [SEGODNYA] Were any kind of military-technical 
innovations used in this operation? 
  [Kokoshin] We brought in many such innovations. 
The A-50's gave a good account of themselves in particular. The 
A-50 in itself of course is not a new aircraft, but its 
electronic "filling" is constantly being upgraded. Certain 
special electronic assets also were used. Many were delivered to 
Mineralnyye vody quickly, both from various security services as 
well as from the Armed Forces. The General Staff Main 
Intelligence Directorate also made its contribution. But much 
remained in reserve. 
  [SEGODNYA] To what extent can the North Caucasus 
operations serve as a model for future antiterrorist 
operations? 
  [Kokoshin] The results of this operation are being 
generalized now. The government assigned [us] the task jointly 
with the MVD and Federal Counterintelligence Service to create 
type instructions or a type plan of action in situations of a 
similar nature for different regions of the country so it is not 
necessary to improvise each time. Unfortunately, the overall 
situation in the country is such that interdepartmental 
antiterrorist plans backed up by appropriate tactics of combat 
operations are extremely necessary today. 
  [SEGODNYA] There really is a great likelihood of 
stepped-up terrorism and of the appearance of new centers of 
inter-ethnic conflicts and local wars on the territory of Russia 
and near its borders in nearby foreign countries. What weapons 
will the Russian Federation Armed Forces need in the new 
situation? 
  [Kokoshin] On 19 January of this year basic 
directions and priorities of a long-range program for arming the 
Russian Army were approved at a Security Council session. 
Low-intensity conflicts and local wars in which far from mass 
armies will take part are among the most likely kinds of armed 
conflicts. This also was reflected in provisions of Russian 
Federation military doctrine. Obviously such an assessment also 
goes for the new kind of operations--fighting terrorism. We have 
a three-stage program designed up to the year 2005 for the 
fighting man's personal gear and equipment and combat 
outfitting, which envisages different levels of outfitting from 
the motorized rifleman to officers of special reconnaissance 
subunits. Units of mobile forces earmarked for immediate or 
rapid reaction will be reoutfitted on a priority basis. 
  Individual operational data display systems are being 
developed: Liquid crystal displays built into a helmet, where a 
fighting man will precisely see his position and that of the 
neighbor and the enemy, i.e., he will receive his own "portion 
of the information" on the situation around him. New types of 
assault weapons have been developed for "Spetsnaz" troops and 
also new kinds of combat clothing. It is very important that the 
armament program provide for upgrading the communications and 
tactical command and control systems. This means above all 
near-real-time transmission of data, communications among 
subunits according to the principle of a cellular telephone 
network (but with necessary and automatic scrambling of verbal 
information being transmitted), and the classic "commander's 
communications." We already have systems for precise topographic 
tie-in of subunits to the terrain using satellite navigation 
systems. True, the individual fighting man cannot be outfitted 
with that system for now inasmuch as satellite communications 
ground elements have considerable weight-size characteristics 
and are very costly. The first individual systems of this nature 
evidently may appear only after the year 2000. 
  In the overall scope of military-technical tasks, the 
Ministry of Defense envisages priority development of various 
precision weapon systems, from close combat systems to 
operational-tactical and strategic systems. There is a program 
for tieing reconnaissance, data transmission and communications 
systems of various levels and purposes into a unified 
information system. The predominant content of the effect 
exerted on the enemy in modern warfare has become not 
pulverizing his personnel, but throwing command and control and 
SIGINT systems into disarray and generally demoralizing troops, 
the command element, and state command and control entities. By 
virtue of this, EW equipment development programs become even 
more important, both for suppressing enemy electronics and 
weapons and for protecting our own weapon systems and data 
collection and transmission systems. Today supremacy of the air 
waves is at the very least equivalent to the factor of air 
supremacy in wars of the middle of the century, and in many 
cases today EW is no longer a secondary means. A new concept, 
the electronic-fire strike, has appeared. Modern EW assets are 
capable not only of "blinding" the enemy for a certain time 
interval, but also putting some of the most important elements 
of his systems completely out of commission. 
  [SEGODNYA] What are the main directions in development 
of strategic nuclear forces? 
  [Kokoshin] This is the topic of a special 
conversation requiring its own place in print and time to cover 
all problems caused by the present geopolitical situation. But I 
will answer briefly that in deployment of strategic nuclear 
deterrence forces we are placing more and more emphasis on 
upgrading the battle management system with respect to improving 
its reliability, and the same thing goes for the missile attack 
warning system. 
  [SEGODNYA] To what extent are the "Basic Directions" 
approved on 19 January supported by budget financing? 
  [Kokoshin] This is a tough question. Prices on raw 
materials, equipment and basic supplies are continuously rising 
in the country, transportation costs are increasing, and 
expenditures for communications services, for paying the labor 
force, and so on are growing. As a result, the cost of 
fulfilling any kind of program is almost impossible to plan 
precisely. Many economists assumed the situation would stabilize 
on reaching the level of world prices, but in many instances now 
our copper, aluminum and silicon, for example, are being sold at 
a price considerably above the world price. For the second year 
the Ministry of Defense has not been financed as befitting a 
major state client of "goods and services" making up the basis 
of effectiveness and efficiency of any country's foreign and 
defense policy. And it is not just a matter of volumes, but also 
of the financing mechanism. In 1993 the Ministry of Finance 
allocated funds to us 56 times, while in previous years they 
would be allocated once every two months and in fully specific 
amounts. Therefore, we are forced to plan different scenarios 
for fulfilling defense programs in a rather wide range of 
pessimistic and optimistic assessments of the development of 
Russia's economy. 
  On the whole, the majority of weapon development and 
production programs now are delayed in connection with the 
shortage of financing. At the same time, through internal 
maneuvering of modest resources we are attempting to move 
priority work forward, especially in development of battle 
management [and] communications systems, above all at the 
tactical level. We also are trying to finance the development of 
EW assets on a priority basis. The fact is, one has to pay in 
blood for shortcomings in communications and command and control 
systems. 
  It is very difficult to concentrate and maneuver funds today 
as never before. It is obvious that science-intensive industries 
must be saved first of all, but more often than not this enters 
into contradiction with the need to maintain sociopolitical 
stability in society, inasmuch as the more sophisticated 
production is, the fewer workers there are in it. Ordinary 
plants of the former military-industrial complex in which tens 
of thousands of engineering-technical personnel and workers are 
employed, where the production capacities have not been utilized 
for several years in a row now, and where latent unemployment is 
growing may remain essentially without budget financing. It 
often happens that wages of a considerably larger number of 
workers than strictly needed for manufacturing defense products 
are paid through a defense order. Accordingly, earnings turn out 
to be low. 
  [SEGODNYA] At a 29 December press conference last year, 
Minister of Defense General Grachev stated that "new 
mobilization plans must be made up by the end of 1994 (in 
connection with changes in the situation) in the Ministry of 
Defense system and in other departments." What are the basic 
principles of the new mobilization program? 
  [Kokoshin] Back at the end of 1992 the government 
significantly reduced mobilization assignments for many 
enterprises at our suggestion. Now a further correction of plans 
for mobilization deployment of industry is under way, naturally 
in the direction of their reduction. 
  [SEGODNYA] But perhaps mobilization plans in industry 
are not needed at all? In the majority of western countries such 
plans either are entirely absent or they are of an extremely 
limited nature. 
  [Kokoshin] What do you mean?! I still can agree 
concerning the second part, but with respect to absence, I have 
not yet seen a different scheme in any militarily developed 
power which could replace the system of planning and 
consequently management of mobilization readiness. At this 
stage, planning mobilization capacities not only fulfills tasks 
of preserving and modernizing Russia's defense potential, but it 
also is a component part of national industrial policy. There is 
a special line in the defense budget for which the Ministry of 
the Economy is responsible, but nowhere have military 
departments ever been unconcerned about this line of budget 
appropriations. By the way, very modest funds go for this. 
  Today we are running up against the need for a radical 
revision of principles of forming mobilization plans for 
industry. A multipolar power structure of a world magnitude has 
been forming since the Cold War. For now this process contains a 
mass of military-political and geostrategic uncertainties for 
Russia and neighboring countries. The adopted military doctrine 
reflects realities of today and of the transition period. New 
mobilization plans are being formed for this doctrine. 
  The likelihood of a major war is minimal in this stage, but 
this does not mean it must be completely excluded from possible 
threats to the security of Russia and its allies. 
  [SEGODNYA] Then just who specifically decides the 
question of the complete and final closing of a particular 
defense plant or production? 
  [Kokoshin] The government makes the decision on 
closing a particular military production. The Ministry of 
Defense cannot decide such a question independently, but of 
course it is an interested party, as is any consumer of products 
and services. In fact, everything is decided in the process of 
forming and distributing the defense order within the framework 
of the allocated budget and in selecting the manufacturer of 
products needed by the Ministry of Defense. 
  Generally this is a complicated, painful problem. For 
example, a government decision was made previously that the 
defense state order for 1994 and for the subsequent two years 
will remain at the 1993 level. But now we have received 
instructions to make an additional correction, inasmuch as 
keeping the state order at the 1993 level under conditions of a 
further drop in the level of the GNP and of industrial 
production will signify an increase in the proportion of the 
defense order, which the government cannot undertake. You can 
imagine what a wave of problems again faces us. 
  [SEGODNYA] Tell me, has the problem of the debt for the 
1993 defense order been resolved? 
  [Kokoshin] The state debt to the Ministry of 
Defense was almost 15 times greater by the end of 1993 compared 
with 1992 (in prices comparable with 1992). As a result, a very 
serious situation was created in the defense complex, (as in 
many other sectors of the economy). It is clear that it is 
necessary to change the system of financing defense needs. The 
Ministry of Defense made a set of specific proposals to the 
government. The main task is to preclude such an abnormal 
phenomenon in the future. 
  Today, I view this problem with somewhat greater optimism 
than before. The government is engaged in seeking specific 
solutions in earnest, and a special working group has been 
formed. 
  [SEGODNYA] Is your optimism connected with the 
resignation of Boris Fedorov? 
  [Kokoshin] In no way. Why translate everything 
into personalities? It is not a matter of the personality of a 
particular appointed person (although this also is of 
significance), but of following a sensible financial policy. We 
must not issue subsidies and credits according to the principle 
of "something for everyone" [literally, "a set of earrings for 
all sisters"], with more going to the one who is more impudent 
or is closer, which, by the way, often was done even with the 
tightest monetary practice. We must extricate the productions 
vital to the country element by element and not pay off debts to 
all in succession, but above all to competitive sectors which 
subsequently will be able both to earn a living themselves and 
to allow others to earn one. In particular, I am a proponent of 
helping the aviation and space industries, although 
unquestionably there are many excess capacities there which must 
be reoriented. Here we are competitive: Labor productivity in a 
number of our rocket industry productions is 30 percent higher 
than in the United States, in experts' estimates. 
  It makes no sense to finance all sorts of sectorial 
scientific research through the Ministry of Defense such as 
superpowerful lasers, neutral particle accelerators and other 
exotic projects about which it is unknown when they will be able 
to become weapons. And if we do continue them, then we must do 
so from funds being allocated for basic science and exploratory 
research or from internal sectorial sources of financing. Today 
the Ministry of Defense has money only for a limited number of 
real weapons, and that means the entire defense order and all 
budget defense financing should be concentrated in the Ministry 
of Defense, not scattered to other departments as was the custom 
in Soviet times. We now coordinate joint programs with the 
Ministry of Science, with the State Committee for the Defense 
Industry (I would like it to be done more vigorously), with the 
MVD, with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, and with the 
Border Guard Troops. 
  [SEGODNYA] It turns out that the Ministry of Defense is 
objectively interested in reducing the overall number of 
military enterprises in order to have a concentration of ready 
money instead of its present dissipation? 
  [Kokoshin] We are interested in a radical 
structural reorganization of industry and in a sharp increase in 
labor productivity. The cost system of military production keeps 
dragging us to the bottom. An improvement in economic conditions 
of defense enterprises clearly is needed in a large number of 
cases. The question of a reduction in social infrastructure of 
defense enterprises is an acute one. 
  [SEGODNYA] What is the destiny of the Russian (Soviet) 
stealth aircraft (F-117 analogue)? Insofar as I know, the first 
tests of flying prototypes of such aircraft were held back in 
the 1980's? 
  [Kokoshin] Well, within limits of what is 
permitted, I will attempt to set forth my own viewpoint as a 
scientist with a basic technical engineering education, adjusted 
to a certain extent by my present official position. Let us 
begin by saying that two basic ways for developing stealth 
technology can be traced today: Either make an invisible 
aircraft or an invisible winged missile, which is both cheaper 
and preferable, although the development of radar acquisition 
equipment shows that absolute invisibility is unattainable in 
principle. By the way, our newest radars and other electronic 
equipment have no problems detecting "invisible" U.S. aircraft, 
and at rather long ranges. 
  It is also unquestionable that certain other countries are 
fully capable of adjusting the production of similar detection 
equipment or modernizing old equipment within a certain time, 
and others can purchase it, let's say, for petrodollars. Mass 
creation of "invisible" aircraft will be expensive. At the same 
time, it is possible to reduce "visibility" of conventional 
aircraft by less costly methods and thereby considerably improve 
their combat effectiveness. 
  [SEGODNYA] In developing the new main F-22 fighter the 
Americans undertook to make it more "invisible" through a 
degradation of performance characteristics... 
  [Kokoshin] In the newest military technologies of 
a practical nature it is always necessary to sacrifice 
something; the question is just what to sacrifice. For us, 
performance characteristics traditionally have been the holy of 
holies, although maneuverability is not always the dominating 
value in modern aircraft construction. The capability of an 
aircraft to counter enemy precision weapons and itself employ 
such weapons is more important. This is achieved by EW assets. 
Such is the possible "asymmetric" answer to the challenge of the 
rather promising stealth technology. 
  There are no "cheap" weapon programs in principle, but we 
will have to seek more refined and at the same time more 
economical solutions based on the country's capabilities. The 
world has countries that are highly developed, medium developed 
and poorly developed in the military-technical sense. One's own 
set of weapons is needed in case of a conflict, depending on the 
enemy's level.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Oleg Vladykin </F>
under the "Topical Matter" rubric: "Plotting with Criminals: 
Weapons Loss Tied to Servicemen's Involvement"] 
  [Text] As soon as spring breezes start blowing and girls' 
skirts become terribly short, every troop service agency should, 
without any instructions "from above," initiate steps to prevent 
rape and other violations (typical for the warm season) 
committed by servicemen. When I for the first time heard this 
kind of statement made at a serious conference called by the 
Ministry of Defense, it was then that I dropped my doubts about 
the Ministry of Defense possessing the capability of effecting 
major and immediate changes in its approach to old intra-Army 
problems and contradictions on the one hand, and those acquired 
relatively recently on the other. 
  It appeared that the above was an indication of an actual 
overcoming of the past tendency to explain various difficulties 
related to the organization of troop activities on the primary 
basis of placing the blame on the harmful influence of some kind 
of external factors. Nonetheless, those factors still exist and 
are not to be dropped from consideration, of course. Now, 
however, the major focus of attention is to be on purely 
Army-related causes associated with the existence of many 
negative phenomena occurring in military units, with stress 
placed on in-service, troop-generated capabilities of combatting 
these negative phenomena. 
  The above at least was the impression I gained by attending 
assemblies held at the end of last year for chiefs of 
departments (sections, groups) of troop services of RF [Russian 
Federation] Armed Forces branches, military districts, groups of 
forces, combat arms, fleets, and main and central directorates 
of the MO RF [Ministry of Defense, Russian Federation]. 
  A definite example of the information presented at the 
representative conference was the number of weapons stolen in 
1992 and 1993, a figure in excess of 22,000 pieces. In this 
connection, no one raised his hands toward heaven asking the 
Almighty about the inevitability of this kind of trouble, what 
with 1,183 incidents of attacks on military facilities that 
occurred in that time period. After all, it was possible to 
reduce by a factor greater than 16 the number of weapons stolen 
in 1993 compared with 1992. The reduction in the case of weapons 
stolen in attacks was as much as a factor of 25. Although it was 
pointed out that the socio-political instability prevalent in 
society and the raging activity of the country's criminal 
element are contributing to a rapid increase in number of 
villains rushing to get their hands on weapons, the talk was 
mostly of other causes of weapons theft. At the top of the list 
are gross violations and poor organization of weapons storage in 
units proper and a lack of skill in closing the gaps to stop the 
weapons outflow. All one need do is realize that last year not a 
single case of weapons loss in any district or group of forces 
was not attributable to servicemen's culpability. 
  As pointed out in the assemblies by Lieutenant General 
Valentin Bogdanchikov, chief of the Troop Activities and Service 
Directorate, General Staff, Russian Federation Armed Forces, 
checks made on the state of security of weapons and ammunition 
indicate that units and subunits fail to maintain strict record 
keeping by piece number of small arms and do not conduct timely 
coordination with the missile and artillery equipment (RAV) 
service. Especially surprising was the revelation that this kind 
of violation was uncovered even in the staff of the VDV 
[Airborne Troops]. 
  I can present an example of this kind of "carelessness" by 
citing an incident occurring in the Caspian Flotilla. The chief 
of a military equipment depot became overcome with anticipating 
idle pleasures and thus "forgot," before going on liberty, to 
turn over his watch to another serviceman. Returning to duty 
rested and refreshed, he was to learn that a commission working 
in the unit determined that in the weapons storage facility in 
his charge there had been a loss of 15 AK-74 assault rifles, 22 
PM pistols, and two Margolin target pistols. Investigation 
revealed that two conscripted servicemen from a guard platoon 
who had been detailed many times to stack weapons onto shelves 
had taken advantage of the depot chief's lack of attention to 
duty. 
  Incidentally, the unsound practice of employing servicemen 
from guard subunits to perform various tasks in storage 
facilities of and by itself constitutes a groundwork for theft 
of weapons. Indeed, this alone gives rise to considerable 
expansion of the circle of persons familiar with the layout of 
depot security means and restrictions and the kind of property 
located therein. 
  General Bogdanchikov was openly distressed as he informed 
the 
audience that one out of five incidents of weapons theft is 
carried out on the basis of a plot between civilian criminals 
and servicemen. Of those persons convicted of this, about 10 
percent are officers, of which one out of two commits the gross 
violation of his service duty for personal gain. 
  Alas! A flawed passion destroys the conscience and clouds 
the 
mind even in the case of officials of fairly high rank, those 
whose duty it is to personally organize the storage and security 
of weapons. Major I. Shchegolev, chief of the RAV service of a 
Far Eastern Military District regiment, was charged with his 
personally committing the theft and sale of 256 PM pistols. To 
date, 86 pieces are still missing. And, who knows, it may be 
that some of the weapons passed to the outside world by the 
major may already have taken their bloody toll. 
  One can spend much time being disturbed over the moral 
deficiency of some servicemen and make an appeal for more 
thorough cadre and educational work in units, but I nonetheless 
was pleased that at the assemblies this was not chosen as the 
plan of attack, with the recommendations instead favoring the 
much more reasonable approach of casting doubts on the 
usefulness of exhorting adults of not doing naughty things. 
Persons afflicted with moral flaws, as we all know, are always 
considerably fewer in number compared to normal people. And so, 
the majority are able to simply adhere to principles which serve 
as substantial blocks to the manifestation of the worst of human 
characteristics. In the Army, this kind of principle is 
considered to be that which is required by the regulations. 
  It is precisely in this area that we have prospects for 
resolving many problems presently plaguing us. For in the last 
few years, unfortunately, in many military units the 
requirements as set down in the regulations and in other 
normative documents have been relegated to the category of some 
kind of relative or highly conditional rules. They are 
desireable of execution, but far from mandatory, so to speak. 
How and why this phenomenon has become widespread is a topic of 
another and more detailed discussion. I would now like to cite 
the words spoken by General Bogdanchikov relative to the 
situation existing among troops in the aspect of its generating 
contempt for regulations. 
  "I find it necessary to state," said Valentin Alekseyevich, 
"that, in principle, it has become pointless in the case of a 
number of military units to speak of any kind of small forward 
movements in improving the level of internal order and military 
discipline. In those units, it is necessary to start at the 
beginning, in effect from zero, to organize the entire service, 
since the greater part of the incidents and violations is 
committed with the connivance, indeed with the personal 
participation, of duty detail officials." 
  Even in a first approximation, one can hardly consider as 
military, in the true sense of the term, the collective where 
Officer of the Day Captain V. Anoshin, acting jointly with staff 
and motor pool duty personnel, were drinking heavily without 
stopping at night in July. While this was going on, the unit 
commander's vehicle was making regular runs between the military 
installation and shopping centers so that the personnel of all 
the subunits could also have some fun in alcoholic revelry. The 
next morning, as could be expected, the entire lot of them 
suffered severe headaches. It is true, however, that the heavy 
hangover was not the only cause. Two pistols disappeared from 
the unit. 
  Last year, continued disregard of the regulations led to an 
unprecedented growth in violations in the Pacific Ocean Fleet 
(19 percent), the Baltic Fleet (26 percent), the North Caucasus 
Military District (32 percent), and the 14th Guards Army (50 
percent). Also occurring there was an abrupt rise in absence 
without official leave. As discovered by numerous checks, 
reporting of such cases does not fully reflect the magnitude of 
the situation existing there. 
  As of the time the assemblies were taking place in the Armed 
Forces, the number of conscript soldiers and sailors absent 
without official leave amounted to more than 5,000. In addition, 
commissions that were taking this count in units uncovered a 
large number of cases where this kind of violation was covered 
up. The Moscow Military Headquarters apprehends on a daily basis 
15 to 20 servicemen who are absent from their duty stations 
without authorization. Of that number, only about half are 
usually included on General Staff lists of servicemen at large. 
The names of the remaining servicemen are not reported by the 
districts. 
  All of the above compelled leaders of troop service agencies 
to do some serious thinking about their own unused capabilities 
for strengthening compliance with regulations in units and 
garrisons and for preventing violations committed by servicemen. 
Speakers discussed the need for improved organization of 
unscheduled checks in units, apprehension of violators, and 
expansion of cooperation in this activity with law enforcement 
agencies. A great deal of stress was placed on major improvement 
of the entire system of routine military duties, garrison 
service, and guard duty. 
  Discussed in the assemblies was the especially alarming 
topic 
of the poor training possessed by personnel involved with guard 
duty. Many soldiers lack the skill required to react, at the 
necessary instant, to employ their weapons decisively to counter 
attacks on guarded facilities by criminals. Last year, this led 
to 26 deaths and wounding of 60 sentries and other guard detail 
personnel. These tragic figures constitute a driving force for 
allotting a high priority to training of personnel in methods of 
offering effective self-protection and defense at their duty 
post, while demanding that guards acquire a high order of skill 
and exercise strict compliance with regulations. 
  There is more. It would appear that the personnel shortage 
in 
units should serve as an impetus to introducing technical 
security means (TSOs) on a wide basis and to initiating a 
continual shift from the mounting of guard details to the 
employment of security monitoring teams. In this connection, 
this was the purpose of deliveries of a large number of 
perimeter security systems and facility security systems in 
1993. However, the number of TSOs set up and operated showed 
virtually no increase over the previous year. The explanation of 
that is simple: In almost all military districts, the equipment 
was unwisely taken apart and the components distributed among 
units. This resulted in the mere appearance of all the districts 
possessing the equipment, whereas in reality none of the 
districts could put together an integral security system which 
could be used with maximum effectiveness. 
  Nevertheless, good experience was enjoyed in the case of 
radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops and in a 
number of large units of the RVSN [Strategic Rocket Forces], 
where an altogether different route was taken. They accumulated 
the TSOs delivered to them and set them up, according priority 
to the most important facilities. They strove to effect a 
complete shift to the use of security monitoring teams, at first 
for one large unit, then for a second, etc. This approach is 
feasible for any district or large unit. 
  However, regardless of how advanced equipment may be, still 
of decisive importance as far as normal organization of troop 
service is concerned is personnel involvement to this end. This 
item, personnel involvement, was clearly missing, judging by the 
numerous times when incidents and gross violation of military 
discipline were covered up in units. Officials of virtually all 
levels in field units were unwilling to deal with the 
unfortunate state of affairs in the units and subunits they 
commanded, desperately attempting to keep from reporting 
"upstairs" on the actual situation for fear of incurring 
punishment. 
  In essence, this unethical behavior was supported in the 
Armed Forces for decades by an incident and violation record 
keeping system and requirement for mandatory inculpation of 
commanders and chiefs for any infraction committed by 
subordinates. The fallaciousness of the above was written about 
a number of times by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  Thus, in acquainting the officers with the new guidance 
documents, Major General Yuriy Kudinov, deputy chief of Troop 
Activities and Service Directorate, RF Armed Forces General 
Staff, stated that there finally is available a new and 
completely reasonable legal norm. Now commanders and chiefs will 
be held accountable for incidents and violations in units only 
in the event investigation reveals that it is their actions, or, 
alternately, the absence thereof, that lead to criminal 
activity. In a word, the situation has undergone a radical 
change. 
  Officials in line units can now feel free, without 
hesitation, to look into any "abscess" and decisively report any 
violation of regulations without fear of subsequently being 
rudely held to task. This means that it is possible to bring 
military life into full compliance with the requirements of 
Russian laws, general military regulations, orders, and other 
documents governing the activities of troops. The time has come 
to deal with the matter seriously.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of </F>
the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, by Colonel 
Anatoliy Belousov and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Dolinin; date 
and place not given: "Russia's Armed Forces -- Today and 
Tomorrow. Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Chief of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, Answers KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA Correspondents' Questions"] 
  [Text] [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Mikhail Petrovich, we will soon 
be celebrating the second anniversary of the creation of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces. What, in your view, is 
remarkable about these two years? 
  [Kolesnikov] The most remarkable point has been that we have 
indeed set up Russian Armed Forces. And those are not just 
words. Despite the fact that the bulk of former USSR Armed 
Forces groupings were part of the Russian Army, they did not 
represent an integrated military organization. That was the 
first problem which we had to deal with. 
  The results of our work were assessed by the Russian 
Federation president in his address to the Federal Assembly. He 
noted that the Armed Forces are combat-ready and capable of 
carrying out the tasks facing them. This assessment from the 
supreme commander in chief places a great responsibility on us 
and, at the same time, attests to the correctness of the 
approaches chosen by the Defense Ministry toward the 
safeguarding of security. 
  As for specific measures, I believe that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
readers know about them. These include the cutbacks in Armed 
Forces manpower, the troop withdrawal from other states, and 
structural changes in administrative organs. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Just how substantive have been the changes 
to the initial reform concept? After all, two years ago we were 
all hoping that the country's economic position now would not be 
so difficult. But the situation regarding Army funding has not 
improved and there are still big problems, so it seems to some 
of our readers that under these conditions any break with the 
existing specific structure of the Armed Forces will inevitably 
lead to breakdowns in command and control.... 
  [Kolesnikov] I would like to note that the main measures 
regarding the organizational development of the Russian Armed 
Forces were drawn up and reflected in the concept and plan for 
the organizational development of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces. And although, owing to funding difficulties, we are 
indeed changing the timetable for the introduction of certain 
military infrastructure projects and the pace of the technical 
equipping of the troops has been slowed, the questions of their 
military and technical provision are being very actively 
resolved and, on the whole, the main thrust of the creation and 
reform of the Army and Navy is being maintained. This includes 
improving the structure and composition of the Armed Forces, 
reforming the Defense Ministry's military-technical policy and 
the principle for manpower acquisition, enhancing combat and 
mobilization readiness.... 
  As regards the second half of your question, I would like to 
reassure readers -- we are being very cautious about changing 
the structure and combat makeup of the Armed Forces. And 
decisions are made only after painstaking theoretical analysis 
and practical checks, and, of course, not to the detriment of 
the troops' combat readiness. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is well known that the first strategic 
echelon of the former USSR's defense ceased to exist with the 
troop withdrawal from East Europe. The second echelon troops 
remain behind in our nearest neighbors, and our former internal 
districts -- like Moscow and the North Caucasus -- have become 
border districts. What are the prospects for their development? 
  [Kolesnikov] The demise of the USSR resulted in a 
fundamental break in the disposition of forces. We lost 
territories and, correspondingly, a strategic echelon, and 
reserve troops formed the basis of the first operational 
echelon. It was necessary to create force groupings in all the 
western and southwestern sectors virtually from scratch. The 
problem was that large strategic formations and combined units 
were being organized from scratch, and this required the 
preparation of the relevant infrastructure. This has happened 
during a period of Armed Forces organizational development and 
reform, with an acute shortage of material resources and 
funding. As a result, the tasks and role of the Leningrad, 
Moscow, and North Caucasus Military Districts have changed 
substantially.... 
  The Russian Federation border in the west now runs through 
the western borders of Leningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, Bryansk, 
Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Rostov Oblasts and, in the 
southwest, through Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, 
Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Ingushetia, and 
Dagestan -- as a result of which the Moscow and North Caucasus 
Military Districts have acquired the status of border districts. 
Their staffing has been increased somewhat. But I consider it 
necessary to draw attention to the fact that the increase is 
taking place in connection with the Russian troop withdrawal 
from other states. We are proceeding primarily on the basis of 
the convenience of stationing and providing for those troops on 
national territory. Several additional combined and other units 
have been set up in the southwest -- in the North Caucasus 
Military District -- primarily with light weapons. 
  As far as prospects are concerned, these are to conclude the 
reception of the troops withdrawn from the FRG and the Baltic in 
these districts, to billet them, make provision for them, and 
organize planned combat training in them. On the whole, border 
military districts as newly constituted will have to resolve the 
tasks of safeguarding Russia's military security in accordance 
with the changed conditions of the current situation. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] The transition which began last year to 
the mixed method of Army and Navy staffing has shown that 
contract service is not all plain sailing. In particular, it 
has not proved possible to substantially use contract servicemen 
to fill positions which primarily determine the combat 
capability of units and ships, or positions in troops carrying 
out peacekeeping missions. This year another 150,000 contract 
servicemen should join the forces. Will they again find 
themselves at bases, dumps, and other "hot" spots? What needs 
to be done to prevent this happening? 
  [Kolesnikov] The Russian Federation president in his edict 
No. 166 of 18 January 1994 instructed the Defense Ministry to 
recruit 150,000 volunteers to fill primarily combat positions. 
In execution of these instructions the defense minister, 
defining the tasks for 1994, called for candidates to be taken 
on for military service under contract as soldiers and sailors 
with the kind of skills in particularly short supply which 
determine the combat capability of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces. He ratified a list of these positions, and for each of 
them the qualification requirements which the candidates taken 
on under contract would have to meet were drawn up. Moreover, 
in order to create a material incentive, pay scales for the main 
posts -- including gunnery commanders, pontoon bridge 
commanders, self-propelled artillery commanders, mine 
specialists, reconnaissance troops, divers, crane operators, and 
so forth -- have been increased. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Let's talk about alternative service.... 
  [Kolesnikov] There is currently no law on alternative 
(nonmilitary) service in the Russian Federation, although this 
kind of service is laid down by the Russian Federation 
Constitution. 
  Obviously, in drafting such a law -- whose speedy adoption 
is 
increasingly being advocated by the public and by spiritual or 
religious organizations -- the provisions of the relevant 
international acts, and world practice in the organization and 
implementation of alternative service will be taken into 
account. At the same time, it must also take account of national 
interests and, above all, of the need to reliably safeguard the 
state's defense capability. We have made progress in this area. 
  I think that it will be necessary to refrain at least until 
1997 from adopting or even introducing a Russian Federation law 
on alternative service. There is a whole host of reasons for 
this, chief among which is the exceptionally difficult situation 
with regard to the manpower acquisition of soldiers, sailors, 
warrant officers, and petty officers in the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces and other troops owing to the severe shortage of 
draft resources and the still very undeveloped system of 
contract service, whose formation should have been completed 
only by 1997-1999. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is understandable that the problem of 
military-technical policy should have a special place in the 
organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Under 
today's conditions of tight financial appropriations for 
defense, what priorities can be highlighted in the development 
and purchase of arms and military hardware? 
  [Kolesnikov] On the basis of the main provisions of military 
doctrine, military-technical policy is aimed at concentrating 
limited financial resources in order to develop weapons with 
flexible [mezhvidovoy] applications ensuring the resolution of 
tasks primarily in local wars and conflicts. The main 
priorities in developing and purchasing armaments and military 
hardware are integrated reconnaissance, communications, and 
battle management systems and weapons. 
  When buying armaments at the minimum level necessary to 
preserve a core military-industrial potential, stress is laid on 
developing the scientific and technical contribution and to 
working on key elements which will make it possible, when the 
economic situation improves, to move to full-scale work and to 
provide timely supplies of the requisite numbers of modern 
weapons for the Army and Navy. 
  Currently, as a result of meager Defense Ministry funding, 
the number of weapons types that are under development or have 
been modernized has been severely cut back, along with the total 
volume of purchases. Any further funding cuts could lead to the 
collapse of the defense industry, the loss of core scientific 
and defense potential, and an inability to independently develop 
[sozdavat] and produce basic competitive high-tech prototypes of 
weapons and military hardware. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] At the start of the reforms there were a 
lot of complaints about the inadequacy of the relevant 
legislative base. How do you now assess the legal backup for 
Armed Forces organizational development and the provision of 
social guarantees for servicemen? What new progress has been 
made in this direction? 
  [Kolesnikov] The legal foundations for the organizational 
development and activity of the Russian Federation Armed Forces 
have basically already been created. Eleven laws and more than 
100 other normative legal acts have been adopted and are in 
force in the defense sphere. The main provisions of Russian 
Federation military doctrine have been ratified for the first 
time at the level of a normative legal act. 
  We will now have to bring the legal basis for the 
organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces into 
line with the Constitution and the main provisions of the 
Russian Federation's military doctrine, and to create a 
clear-cut system of military legislation. We have prepared 
proposals on clarifying current laws and elaborating new ones in 
the defense sphere. Above all, these would be laws making 
amendments and additions to the Russian Federation laws "On 
Defense," "On the Draft and Military Service," "On the Status of 
Servicemen," "On Pension Provision for Servicemen".... We will 
have to draw up and adopt new laws: "On Martial Law," "On the 
Military Militia (Police)," "On Military Courts," and others -- 
more than 20 draft laws in all. 
  Moreover, we need a package of normative legal acts to 
define 
the procedure for implementing military organizational 
development as a whole. 
  As for social guarantees for servicemen, these have been 
laid 
down by Russian Federation laws and other normative acts issued 
by the Russian Federation president and Government. 
Unfortunately, a number of provisions of the Russian Federation 
law "On the Status of Servicemen" are not in operation owing to 
the fact that a mechanism for implementing them has not been 
defined and there is no funding available. We will have to 
fully develop a mechanism for implementing the privileges, 
guarantees, and compensation laid down by law for servicemen, 
persons discharged from military service, and their family 
members. 
  Moreover, on the basis of constitutional principles, we are 
planning to step up legal protection for servicemen and Armed 
Forces' civilian personnel in military administrative organs and 
military units, to charge the military-legal service with the 
defense of their legitimate interests, and to set up a military 
advocate's service. These and other changes in the 
military-legal sphere will be implemented within the framework 
of military-legal reform in the Russian Federation Armed Forces. 
This is something that the Russian Federation president in his 
address to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly made one of 
the main avenues of Armed Forces organizational development. 
  The Defense Ministry is currently drawing up a concept for 
military-legal reform whose measures will be implemented in 
coordination with other military reform measures in 1994-1995 
and in the subsequent period. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] One last question, Mikhail Petrovich, 
regarding the press. Or, rather, relations between the General 
Staff and the press. After all, a lot of people in the writing 
fraternity have recently been making loud statements on the 
subject of negative aspects of the Army. And everything in this 
area is, as the saying goes, grist to the mill -- from the 
publication of unverified facts to out-and-out lying. How do 
you personally react when you encounter these sorts of articles? 
On the other hand, to what extent has a link been established 
between the General Staff and the press? 
  [Kolesnikov] I would call the relationship between the 
General Staff and most of the Russian media entirely normal. 
With the help of the Defense Ministry's Information and Press 
Directorate, we have organized regular business contacts. We 
are striving to ensure that all the most important events in the 
life of the Armed Forces with a direct impact on the General 
Staff's sphere of activity are covered by media representatives. 
We systematically invite them to briefings and press 
conferences, answer their questions, give interviews, consult 
with them on the most difficult problems, and prepare articles 
at editorial collectives' request. Field trips by journalists 
to military units, visits to various Army and Navy 
installations, military-training establishments, training 
centers, and so forth are organized with the direct 
participation of General Staff personnel. This kind of 
relationship between the press and the General Staff has already 
become an established system and allows us to make our military 
policy more open to society. Our fellow countrymen get an 
entirely objective idea about everything taking place in the 
Army. 
  At the same time, certain journalists have clearly failed to 
cement a relationship with the General Staff. And we are by no 
means to blame. Certain journalists are trying to make a name 
for themselves with pseudosensationalistic stories, unconfirmed 
facts, rumors, conjecture, and sometimes even barefaced lies. 
Take, for instance, the "report from entirely reliable sources" 
that there is allegedly already some kind of plan in place for 
dividing up the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. Totally 
false! And I could quote dozens of examples like that. How do 
I personally react to all this? In different ways. Sometimes I 
just swear, but most often I give instructions for a 
corresponding explanation or refutation to be prepared if the 
lies are, as they say, totally off the wall and could have major 
negative consequences not only for Russian public opinion but 
also for international relations. 
  Of course, you cannot muzzle everyone. Freedom of speech has 
brought to journalism not only greater glasnost, but also 
irresponsibility when it comes to dealing with information. We 
at the General Staff are increasingly arriving at the conclusion 
that the relevant articles of the law on the mass media are not 
working. If liars and spreaders of disinformation and calumny 
were taken to court more often, then many of them would probably 
lose their "appetite" for making a name for themselves through 
lying. We probably need to stop being always on the defensive. 
We will combat those who besmirch us in the appropriate manner 
-- following the letter and spirit of the law. But it is better 
to build civilized relations in the way that is generally 
accepted worldwide -- using the language of truth and mutual 
respect.

  [Text] Kaliningrad, 17 Mar -- "Additional possibilities to 
build up Russia's military budget will be found," Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has announced. Addressing 
journalists, he said his "prolonged meetings with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets," which took place on Wednesday, gave him hope that 
the military budget would be increased. 
  Let us remind you, on the eve of his visit to Kaliningrad, 
Pavel Grachev sharply criticized the military budget proposed by 
the Finance Ministry and regards the allocated funds as 
insufficient. The defense minister also laid great hopes on the 
State Duma which, in his opinion, "is not indifferent to the 
fate of the defense capacity of our state."

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, branch director of the </F>
Department for Information and the Press of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under "Smolenskaya 
Square" rubric: "Legal Status of Russian Military Presence: 
Moscow Is Filling the Vacuum of Power and Is Protecting 
Russians"] 
  [Text] Under the conditions of the collective security 
system that is being established in the framework of the CIS, of 
particular urgency is the question of the presence of Russian 
forces in the states that arose after the collapse of the former 
USSR. As a result of the disintegration of the common military 
area, a considerable share of the forces along with their 
military equipment and gear ended up beyond the borders of 
Russia. Today they exist in the form of groupings of forces or 
individual military installations throughout practically the 
entire territory of the former USSR. It is not difficult to 
imagine the consequences, for example, of the withdrawal of 
Russian forces from Tajikistan and of the failure of Russia to 
fulfill its peacemaking functions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, 
Karabakh, and Moldova. In such an event, the fate of millions of 
our compatriots and the local population living in the "hot 
spots" of the CIS will be threatened. Nor should one fail to 
take into account the essential lack of a dependable defense and 
protection of the former external border of the USSR. This 
concern, by the way, is also shared by many national leaders. 
  In addition, the vacuum would inevitably complicate Russia's 
strategic military position and unavoidably would be filled by 
forces unfriendly to Russia. Without doubt this would also 
change the military-political landscape for other states. The 
military presence of Russia in those and other regions is 
essential for the purpose of protecting the economic interests 
of Russia. 
  It is quite natural, considering the entire complex of 
problems, that Russia cannot so easily leave the zone of its 
traditional and direct influence at once. The risk would be too 
great. But it cannot remain as an uninvited guest. The minister 
of defense of the Russian Federation declared that by the end of 
this year Russian military contingents will be withdrawn from 
the territory of other states whatever the cost may be. But this 
certainly does not mean that Russia is renouncing a military 
presence in regions of its primary attention. From now on this 
problem will be resolved through civilized methods with the 
consent of those countries that request this; that is, it is a 
matter of generally recognized forms of deploying forces in 
foreign territory on a legal basis. 
  One of the forms of such a presence is the establishment of 
Russian military bases in the territory of the countries of the 
CIS on the basis of mutually acceptable agreements. Overall, 
they may constitute elements of the general defensive area of 
the Commonwealth and help to preserve unified systems in the 
military infrastructure. An example is the protocal signed in 
the course of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi that provides for 
the establishment of military bases of the Russian Federation in 
Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. In the near future, a working 
group of both sides will define questions in the support of the 
military bases, the number of personnel, and the amount of 
military equipment there. Their task is to guarantee the 
security of Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region 
included in the Collective Security Treaty. The Georgian 
leadership is making no secret of its interest in the presence 
of Russian forces in Transcaucasia. It seems that they are also 
inclined in this direction in Yerevan and Baku. It appears that 
Armenia will sign an analogous document on the establishment of 
a military base. There has already been preliminary consultation 
on this question. 
  There has been some movement on military questions with 
Kazakhstan. Experts have been assigned the task of working out a 
treaty on military cooperation in the very near future, which 
will reflect problems having to do with the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons to Russia. Negotitations are under way on the 
future of Baykonur and other facilities and test ranges located 
in the territory of Kazakhstan. 
  It appears that in the deployment of Russian forces in the 
near abroad it is necessary above all to define their status. 
They must guarantee the security interests of Russia without 
intervening in the internal life of other states. At the same 
time, with the agreement of the sides, it is possible to utilize 
Russian forces as peacemaking forces in the settlement of 
conflicts. There is nothing unnatural in this either, because 
today only they are capable of ensuring a reduction of armed 
actions and putting an end to bloodshed in the "hot spots." 
Examples of this are the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and 
Tajikistan. Because of the specific nature of our relations in 
the scope of the former Union and our knowledge of local 
problems, it is much easier for Russia to carry out peacemaking 
actions in these regions than for other states to do so. In 
addition, it is not in the interests of Russia to allow the 
presence of military contingents of third countries in the 
territory of the states of the former USSR. It is a pity that 
until now no UN mandate has been received, which, in addition to 
everything else, would reduce the burden of our material outlays 
for the performance of peacemaking operations. 
  The military presence of Russia in the near abroad will 
require substantial subsidies from the state treasury for the 
support of military and civilian personnel, the payment of rent 
for the territories and premises, the housing and support of the 
troops, the establishment of the infrastructure, the repair of 
bases, etc. The total expenditures will depend to a considerable 
extent upon the conditions of the deployment of the forces. In 
the event that some state or other of the CIS is interested in 
basing Russian forces in its territory, it is necessary to 
strive for an equivalent distribution of expenditures for their 
support on a parity basis. 
  A standard draft agreement worked out by the group could 
serve as the basis for subsequent agreements on the basing of 
Russian forces in the states of the Commonwealth. But it must 
not be perceived as dogma. It is absolutely essential to take 
into account the peculiarities of each country. In any 
agreement, however, it is expedient to provide for articles 
involving the financing of the troops and the interaction and 
interrelationships of the Russian units with local authorities 
and their army structures, including in the carrying out of 
joint exercises and maneuvers, and about the Russian military 
respecting the laws of the country where they are stationed and 
the uninterrupted supplying of Russian military units and 
installations. 
  It is also important to set forth positions on social and 
material guarantees for the service personnel and the members of 
their families taking into account the specific nature of the 
places where they are deployed. For it is no secret that with 
the introduction of national currencies the living standard of 
our military people in service in the armed forces of former 
Soviet republics declined dramatically, although there are 
corresponding bilateral agreements in this respect. It is 
therefore expedient to work out a mechanism for their 
realization and to provide for sanctions in the event that the 
agreements are not fulfilled. 
  In the preparation of documents of this kind, it is 
desirable 
to appeal to the experience of foreign armies. Nor should one 
ignore the experience in the negotiations on the conditions for 
the stay and withdrawal of Soviet forces from the countries of 
Eastern Europe, putting into effect formulas that have already 
been developed. 
  In foreign circles, the motives for the preservation of our 
military presence in the states of the CIS are perceived in 
different ways. Apparently, the politicians and analysts there 
do not have a clear notion of the special role of the Russian 
Army, whereas some are simply suspicious of Moscow's noble 
intentions to establish conditions of stability along the entire 
perimeter of the Russian borders. It is important to realize 
that these bases do not threaten anyone. They are called upon to 
protect the interests of the contracting states and peacemaking 
actions. There is therefore scarcely any need to attribute 
nonexisting "imperial ambitions" to Russia in the geopolitical 
territory of the former USSR. 
  The establishment of Russian military bases fits very well 
into the framework of the Collective Security Treaty of the CIS 
as well as other bilateral agreements. Today it is merely a 
matter of the implementation of the corresponding positions. The 
legal basis for the deployment of Russian forces abroad is the 
Law of the Russian Federation "On Defense," which permits the 
stationing of troops and naval forces beyond its borders with 
the consent of parliament. In addition, a fundamental principle 
of their basing is the mutual interest of the sides, which does 
not contradict Article 51 of the UN Charter providing for the 
right of a state to individual or collective self-defense. The 
experience of postwar Europe shows that this can have a 
stabilizing influence on the situation in some country or other 
and in the region.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Aleksandr Yegorov, </F>
under the rubric: "Arsenal": "Spetnaz Weapons"] 
  [Text] Everyone knows the story of the capture of 
Powers, the American U-2 pilot who was shot down by a 
surface-to-air missile over Soviet territory. That story 
preceded the appearance in Russia of weapons that were developed 
and are being produced under the classification of 
"spetsizdeliye" [special item]. Powers was armed with a silent 
discharge weapon -- a pistol with a barrel silencer -- that was 
unknown in the USSR at that time. 
  Because lagging behind in any sphere of weapons was 
very severely assessed in those years, the model was urgently 
sent to the Central Institute of Precision Machine Building 
(TsNIITOChMASh), already at that time a leading scientific 
center, where they researched, developed and tested practically 
all models of firearms comprehensively, together with the round. 
The experience and reserves that had been accumulated at the 
institute, and also the talent of Engineer and Designer Anatoliy 
Arsenyevich Deryagin, permitted them to quite rapidly accomplish 
the task. Soviet "competent organs" obtained a 
domestically-developed silent discharge pistol system. And at 
TsNIITOChMASh a new direction of research was opened by this 
topic -- individual protection weapons and equipping special 
subunits. 
  One of the results of this research was the acceptance 
into the inventory of a silent weapons system and a team of 
designers (I. Kasyanov, A. Deryagin, P. Serdyukov, V. Petrov) 
was awarded the Russian Federation State Prize for that. 
  Three models are part of the system: "Vintorez" 9-mm 
Sniper Rifle, "Val" 9-mm Assault Rifle, and "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm 
Pistol.

<H6>  "Vintorez" </H6>
  Designer Petr Ivanovich Serdyukov utilized the so-called 
classic silencer design -- a barrel silencer -- in the 
development of the "Vintorez" Gas-Vented 9-mm Sniper Rifle. In 
the process, he dealt extraordinarily successfully with the two 
main enemies of silent discharge -- pressure and temperature. 
The gases that propel the bullet toward the barrel's end 
initially end up under the impact of fan-shaped drilled gas 
ports, through which an intensive pressure drop takes place. 
Then -- in the first chamber of the silencer, an expansion 
chamber, where the pressure drops even more simultaneously with 
the lowering of the temperature. And, finally, the so-called 
separator completely "chops up" the jet that follows the bullet, 
dismembering it into numerous streams with different directions. 
A screen completes the cooling. That is the principle. 
  We need to point out that the round also does its part to 
lower the temperature and pressure. This is also specifically 
explained by the large caliber, 9-mm, for a rifle. 
  "Vintorez" is distinguished from other sniper rifles by its 
capability to conduct not only single round fire but also 
bursts. To do this, it can be equipped with 20-round instead of 
standard 10-round magazines. 
  The rifle is equipped with a mechanical -- front sight and 
notched rear sight -- and also with three optical sights, 
including a night vision sight. One of the optical sights is the 
PSO-1 four-power sight with a range finder scale. A special 
screen has been introduced into its design that permits 
detection of infrared radiation sources. The sight is equipped 
with a range and direction adjustment mechanism. 
  "Vintorez's" stock has a special recess which alleviates the 
design and forms a pistol grip. This type of stock was "broken 
in" and proved itself on the famous Dragunov sniper rifle. 
  And, finally, the rifle can be completely disassembled and 
carried in a briefcase. 
<H6>  "Val" </H6>
  The silent assault rifle received the name "Val". The 
silencer type and design is the same. It has been equipped with 
the identical equipment as "Vintorez", including the optical 
sights. The differences are primarily external and they are few. 
Among the most visible are the metal folding stock which 
slightly increased the assault rifle's weight (by 100 grams) and 
compelled the designer to return to the traditional pistol grip. 
The capacity of the magazine has been increased to 20 rounds. We 
discussed it in the portion that concerns "Vintorez's" automatic 
fire. "Val" has been deprived of the briefcase which would 
hardly be appropriate in raids against enemy rear areas. 
  However, there is a fundamental difference. It is in the 
round. "Vintorez" has the SP-5 round that was developed by 
Designer Nikolay Zabelin and "Val" has the SP-6 that was 
developed by Designer Yuriy Frolov. 
  How do they differ? The former is a special sniper round. It 
is designed to destroy personnel. 
  The assault rifle's round has heightened penetrability. It 
easily penetrates a 6-mm sheet of high-strength steel at a range 
of 100 meters. 
<H6>  "Vul" </H6>
  And, finally, the last member of the TsNIITOChMASh family of 
silent weapons -- the "Vul" PSS 7.62-mm pistol that was 
developed by Yuriy Krylov and Viktor Levchenko. 
  This model is a kind of surprise for lovers of 
nontraditional 
solutions, because suppressing the sound of the discharge occurs 
in it based upon an entirely different principle: By employing a 
special round with a powder gas cut-off in it. 
  We need to say that the idea for the development of this 
type 
of ammunition is not new. What is more, such rounds exist and 
are utilized in the world. But in a very limited manner. In 
single-shot and double-barreled systems that are hard to call 
truly combat systems. The reason for that is the imperfection of 
the design and its low effectiveness that is caused by the 
inability of the round to support semi-automatic fire. 
  Viktor Petrov, the developer of the SP-2 (the designation of 
the new round with the powder gas cut-off) took a fundamental 
step forward in this sphere when he developed a round that 
brought the automatic back to life. In the process, the SP-2's 
combat effectiveness is close to the effectiveness of the 
Makarov PM [Makarov Pistol] pistol's round and lags behind it 
only in penetrability: The bullet of the silent round does not 
stick into the fourth 25-mm pine board like the PM but in the 
third board which it enters sideways. That is caused by the 
ammunition's blunt tip that disrupts stability when it 
encounters an obstacle. If you consider that a shortcoming of 
the round, then it is the only one. In the remainder, the PSS is 
no worse than the PM. Moreover, it is equipped with a series of 
innovations, one of which is an adaptation for the installation 
of a modern collimating sight that is indispensable when firing 
under nighttime conditions. The shining dot on the sight, which 
is fed by a small battery, is compatible with night vision 
glasses and creates conditions for firing that are close to 
ideal. Based upon the big picture, sights of this type are 
instruments of the future. 
  The pistol itself provides a decent advantage over its 
competitors. If we turn to the specifications, it exceeds even 
"Vintorez" in the primary one -- the level of noise suppression. 
  Russian silent weapons are one more source of pride for 
the domestic small arms school that is recognized in the 
world.

Valentin Rudenko, under the rubric: "Arsenal": "The Su-33 
Attacks From the Sea"] 
  [Text] There is no more difficult 
mission today in aviation than for a fighter aircraft to land 
and take-off from the deck of a ship. Here special demands are 
made not only on the training of pilots but also on the design 
of aircraft and combat aircraft-carrying ships. 
  The Americans, who know carrier aviation, did not anticipate 
that Russian aircraft builders would be able to develop a 
fighter aircraft with high tactical-technical specifications, 
the take-off of which is carried out using a ski jump. In their 
country, all carrier-based aircraft take-off using steam 
catapults. But they clearly underestimated our capabilities. 
That fighter aircraft has already been developed. What is more, 
it is being series-produced and is being successfully mastered 
not only by test pilots but also by line pilots. As you have 
figured out, this discussion is about the Su-27K carrier-based 
fighter aircraft. (It received the designation Su-33 at the 
Sukhoy Design Bureau). 
  Work on the Su-33 program began in 1984. It was conducted 
under the leadership of "Sukhoy OKB" [Experimental Design 
Bureau] ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Industrial Complex] General 
Designer Mikhail Simonov. A team of developers headed by 
Aircraft Chief Designer Konstantin Marbashev was directly 
involved with the carrier-based fighter aircraft's design. The 
Su-33 completed its first flight in August 1987. Two years 
later, for the first time in our country, Honored Test Pilot 
Viktor Pugachev carried out a successful landing on a heavy 
aircraft-carrying ship and a take-off from the ship's deck using 
a ski jump on 1 November 1989.

  The Su-33 was developed based on the Su-27 fighter aircraft 
that is well known in our country and abroad and therefore 
preserved its best qualities. However, if you compare them from 
the point of view of combat capabilities and design 
peculiarities, they are essentially different aircraft. The 
Su-33 has an integral aerodynamic layout and has been 
manufactured according to the triplane design. Movable 
foreplanes, which substantially improve the aircraft's 
maneuvering capabilities, especially controllability and 
stability during separation from the ski jump, have been 
employed on it for the first time. This is the first fighter 
aircraft of the Su-27 family that is equipped with an aerial 
refueling system. The wing, tail plane panels, and tail and nose 
fairings are folded upward to decrease the aircraft's dimensions 
in the parking area. 
  The fighter aircraft has a very high thrust-to-weight ratio 
-- greater than one. Two AL-31F bypass turbojet engines that 
were developed under the leadership of A.M. Lyulka have been 
installed on it. 
  Aircraft take-off from the ship's deck is carried out using 
a 
ski jump from one of three positions equipped with 
gas-deflecting shields and special restraining devices which are 
retracted after the engine reaches the ChR mode (emergency power 
mode). Even from the shortest distance, a length of 105 meters, 
the fighter aircraft easily takes-off with a full fuel load and 
a full weapons load. 
  There are glidepath beacons, a radar landing system, and 
also 
an optical landing system installed on the ship to support 
landing on a ship which can be accomplished both in the 
automatic, directed, or manual modes. The fighter aircraft 
descends along a very steep glidepath and carries out a landing 
without the traditional leveling off. After touching the ship's 
deck, the arresting hook engages one of the arresting gears, 
which ensures rapid braking and stops the aircraft. A special 
emergency barrier can be utilized in non-standard situations. 
  The aircraft's landing gear has been reinforced as a result 
of the fact that take-off and landing are carried out at 
adequately high G-loads. In the event the arresting hook does 
not engage the arresting gear, the aircraft has the capability 
to safely circle around a second time. 
  The Su-33 is designed to defend Naval ships from air attack 
weapons --aircraft and helicopters, cruise missiles, remotely 
piloted vehicles, and also to destroy ground-based and surface 
targets and to support amphibious assault landings. The weapons 
control system consists of a powerful pulse-Doppler radar that 
is capable of carrying out search while tracking targets in the 
background of the earth and water surface and an 
optical-electronic radar with a helmet-mounted target 
designation system. 
  At the present time, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA recently reported, 
the mastery of the Su-33 is being conducted at an accelerated 
rate by Northern Fleet Aviation personnel. Not only test pilots 
but also line pilots are already successfully carrying out 
landings on the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union 
Kuznetsov Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser. Soon, long ocean 
cruises await the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser and, 
therefore, the Su-33 carrier-based fighter aircraft.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Vladimir Maryukha, </F>
under the rubric: "Timely Topic": "The People Guarding the Sea 
and Coast"] 
  [Text] Today the naval knitted shirt that has faded to the 
color of the sky is worn in the VDV [Airborne Troops] and in the 
internal troops, in any subunit whose name contains the prefix 
"spets" [special] and even in private guard-investigation 
agencies. And at times the attention to this possessor of the 
"naval spirit" is somewhat greater than to those whose knitted 
shirts were later saturated with salt but did not lose their 
natural color. The "winged" infantry, by way of illustration, is 
always being heard from: Airborne troops "are mandatorily 
dropped" for honored guests and journalists at demonstration 
field training exercises and UN blue helmets are issued only in 
"exchange" for blue berets, yes and simply at a difficult 
moment, the first appeal is -- to the Airborne Troops. 
  While not detracting from the Airborne Troops' 
accomplishments and only for the sake of fairness, I must point 
out that the naval infantry surpasses the "winged" infantry, 
both in age of service to the Fatherland and based upon the 
intransigence of traditions and, finally, based upon the number 
and variety of missions being carried out. The 289th year of 
service with small breaks, from the time of Peter the Great's 
Edict on the formation of the first naval infantry brigade -- 
that is a great deal of time! All the more so that in its 
official history alone, the Russian naval infantry is seven 
decades older than the famous American Marines. And we don't 
intend to award only the age laurels. 
  A similar "imperceptibility" of the "black devils", as they 
still quite recently called naval infantrymen, probably lies in 
a different structure of subordination than the American 
structure and in the variability of the names. After a number of 
organic changes, the Naval Infantry became a part of the Navy's 
Coastal Troops which are led by Lieutenant-General Ivan 
Sidorovich Skuratov, incidentally, as far as I know the only 
doctor of military sciences among servicemen of his rank. 
  "We don't need to make the country poor with the ideal 
variant of Armed Forces organizational development," Ivan 
Sidorovich thinks out loud on the problems of reforming the army 
and navy and the troops entrusted to him. -- "We need the 
optimal variant." 
  The Coastal Troops can also serve precisely as a model for 
that optimal variant. The three components of the Coastal Troops 
-- the coastal missile -artillery troops, the coastal defense 
troops and the naval infantry -- naturally do not cover all of 
Russia's sea coasts like a fence. However, due to 
maneuverability and the capability to concentrate on a 
threatened axis in a very short period of time, including 
through reinforcements from another naval theater, the Coastal 
Troops accomplish the missions of combating surface combatants 
and assault landing detachments in the nearby maritime zone, 
defending naval bases and other important facilities on the 
coast, and landing amphibious and air assault forces. In the 
latter case, the Russian Naval Infantry has a great deal of 
experience from the period of the last war (3 amphibious assault 
operations and more than 100 amphibious assault landings) and 
the experience of prolonged performance of combat duty in remote 
areas -- the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and off the 
Western coast of Africa. And a Black Sea Fleet reinforced naval 
infantry battalion has acquired the experience of peacekeeping 
forces operations -- in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area. In 
general, in the context of combat accomplishments, coastal 
defense divisions and naval infantry brigades on the scale of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces are hardly unique. As, for 
example, the Northern Fleet Red Banner Moskovsko-Chernigov 
Guards Division, in which at one time were a battalion of 
cavaliers of Soldiers' Glory and a company of Heroes. 
  Today, reforms are occurring in the Coastal Troops, just 
like 
in the other services and types of troops. Troops are being 
reduced numerically, some portions of them are completing their 
infrastructure in new locations after their withdrawal from the 
near abroad -- Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia, and Turkmenistan. We 
need to create a training facility all over again and, first of 
all, for training the Coastal Troops officer corps. 
  The fact is that, with the current outward commonality of 
specialties in the Coastal Troops, there is a multitude of 
distinctions and nuances that, if they are not taken into 
account, a BRAV [Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops] or MP [Naval 
Infantry] officer can be a good missileer, tank officer, and 
even an airborne troop but... he cannot in the process be a 
representative of the Coastal Troops. They have taught this 
specific feature or spark, if we can say it that way, at the 
special departments of schools that have now turned out to be 
outside Russia's borders (in Odessa, Sumy, and Sevastopol). 
  "Experience has shown," Lieutenant-General I. Skuratov told 
me, "that even the best graduates of `ground forces' military 
schools were lost for a minimum of two years as commanders and 
specialists in our units due to the lack of knowledge of our 
specific features, the navy and, finally, the terms that are 
customary for us." 
  The American experience, to which we have become accustomed 
to citing on any grounds in recent years, also convinces us of 
that. There, across the ocean, they have long understood that 
each person who has arrived to serve in the marines must have 
first of all the spirit of a marine. This spirit is nurtured and 
is sometimes "driven into" a young warrior with something 
resembling our course. You were not broken, you did not succumb 
to weakness at the first obstacle -- therefore you will be a 
marine, is the advertisement of the advantages of service which 
in the United States is no less aggressive than the advertising 
for chewing gum or Camel cigarettes. And only later do they 
train the "prepared" marine as a specialist, be he a 
reconnaissance platoon commander or a regimental cook. The 
Russian Naval Infantry and other Coastal Troops units were 
always strong in a similar kind of elitism. This specific 
feature is being lost when vacant positions are filled with 
random people from disbanded units and that's too bad. It is due 
to that loss of "elite" qualities in a Pacific Ocean Fleet Naval 
Infantry division subunit that recently practically all of the 
officers had to be replaced. 
  Last year, the problem of cadres for the Coastal Troops, 
which extended to the statewide level, finally found its 
solution. St. Petersburg Combined Arms and Kolomna Artillery 
schools were added to the two schools that remained in Russia 
that trained officers for the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops 
and Naval Infantry -- Blagoveshchensk Tank and Far East Combined 
Arms Schools. This year, a coastal department will open at 
Pacific Ocean Higher Naval School imeni S.O. Makarov, although 
the first enrollment, only two classes for the time being, had 
already been conducted in 1993. And what an enrollment! The 
competition -- 7-8 people for each place! The batteries at 
Kolomna Artillery School, where the first but unofficial 
enrollment was carried out already in 1992, were recruited with 
no less competition. Aren't these the prospects for the creation 
of really elite units? 
  It's no accident that when, in the context of military 
reform, the conversation turns to the creation of mobile forces 
in Russia, the naval infantry and Coastal Missile-Artillery 
Troops units were first among the candidates for their 
foundation. The Coastal Troops will live up to the confidence 
that has been placed in it if the question on mobile forces is 
brought to its logical conclusion. But what we in the Coastal 
Troops disagree with is the resubordination -- the "closing" of 
individual units only to the command authorities of the mobile 
forces. And here once again everything depends on the specific 
nature of the Coastal Troops: The training system will change 
with a change of the structure of subordination. Therefore, a 
naval infantryman will become an ordinary motorized rifleman or 
airborne troop after 2-3 years of service in the mobile forces, 
maybe a high-class one but, not a naval infantryman. And they 
essentially conceived the mobile troops to be made up of units 
that are capable of accomplishing those specific missions which 
the Coastal Troops, and only them, are capable of handling. To 
drive a tank or a BMP [armored infantry vehicle], by way of 
illustration, along rugged terrain is one thing. But it is 
altogether something else to negotiate a strip of surf and to 
seize a beachhead on a sea coast in that same vehicle. 
  They do not in the least oversimplify such missions in the 
Coastal Troops. On the contrary, for example, they can be 
deployed only in Kaliningard Oblast on the Baltic but a 
threatened axis can emerge there where no Russian units are left 
on the Baltic seashore. In this matter, "Bereg", the latest 
self-propelled artillery system which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has 
already discussed under the "Arsenal" rubric, could become the 
support for coastal missile-artillery units. But with the 
economy's current disastrous situation, years could pass until 
its acceptance into the inventory. That is why the Coastal 
Troops commander-in-chief frequently reminds his subordinates of 
late: There's no point in hoping and the center will give 
everything in a saucer with a blue border. Old equipment will 
also serve in the hands of masters of their profession. Hence 
Ivan Sidorovich's ideas on the optimal, but not ideal, variant 
of troop reform. 
  Yes, it is difficult for unit commanders to accomplish the 
entire complex of missions facing them under conditions of the 
shortage of personnel and the infrastructure at the new location 
along with maintaining the prescribed combat readiness. But no 
one else will do that for them. Therefore, people are not taught 
to complain about everyday difficulties in the Coastal Troops 
(maybe, that is why they write so little about them?). If they 
say anything about them, it is in jest but they seriously talk 
about the absence of a holiday. There is a tank crewmen's day. 
There is also a border troops day -- but there is no naval 
infantry day in Russia. Unofficially, the Coastal Troops 
celebrate their professional holiday on 16 November. Peter the 
Great issued his edict on the formation of the naval infantry on 
that day in 1705. 
  According to the big picture, the Coastal Troops need not a 
only holiday and the national recognition and respect which they 
quite deservedly enjoyed. Publicity in the good sense of the 
word is needed to attract people for active duty service on 
contract. We need centers like those in the Airborne Troops to 
train those same contract personnel, sergeants and warrant 
officers. During the course of reform, we need to renew the 
arsenal, especially of the Coastal Missile-Artillery Troops. 
  And we also need incentives in the service. In the Coastal 
Troops, these words are understood to be not so much money and 
certificates of award as... real work. This especially concerns 
the naval infantry which previously regularly performed combat 
service on ships at sea and currently can get dirty in 
housekeeping duties. It is one thing to train for the sake of 
training, it is quite another thing to breathe in a chest full 
of salty sea air on an actual cruise, even if it is a 
peacekeeping or humanitarian cruise. That's how it was at the 
very beginning of the revival of the Navy's naval infantry 
during the postwar period. For example, at that time, in 1976, 
it was our naval infantry that was the first to come to the aid 
of the starving population of the Island of Sokotra. And the 
naval amphibious landing troops had quite a few similar 
operations, right up to last year's landing under a smokescreen 
at Poti. 
  And if there is a need -- the Coastal Troops will be the 
first to meet a threat to the Fatherland. Incidentally, not only 
with the current incomplete contingent but also with that 
reserve that underwent training here, in the navy. And that 
won't be a problem for the heroic large units -- if the 
Fatherland just doesn't forget its defenders in peacetime.

  [Text] 
<H5>  To Reduce Like We've Never Reduced Before?! </H5>
  Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank A. Shchurenko, 
a 
generally unworried and smiling man, looked tired and tense 
during these last days before putting to sea. Among the 
multitude of commander's concerns, one especially did not give 
him any peace: An important piece of equipment had recently 
malfunctioned during operations. Under conditions of the large 
amount of work required to repair this mechanism, it would be 
best of all to replace it or, in the worst case, to call in the 
repairmen. But it turns out that the base does not have the 
required spare parts and the specialists are far away. Well 
commander, rely just on yourself and also on your subordinates 
who have been exhausted by evening watches. 
  "By the way, the submarine is under warranty but it is 
currently practically impossible to eliminate the defect through 
the efforts of specialists," you couldn't even sense the 
irritation in Aleksey Grigoryevich's voice and, obviously, how 
much he hated everything. "And this while the guarantee 
enterprises have special maintenance teams. However, try to 
summon these specialists, especially from other republics!" 
  "We receive the following telegrams in response to our 
requests: They say, so, the warranty is still in effect but, 
since we can't send specialists, do the repairs yourselves," 
Submarine Task Force Deputy Commander Captain 1st Rank V. 
Kotomkin entered the conversation. "Excuse me, what kind of 
strange warranty is that?", Vladimir Ivanovich shrugs his 
shoulders in bewilderment. "And the fact is that, having found 
themselves in a difficult economic situation, the enterprises 
have stopped paying temporary duty assignment expenses to their 
specialists. These people even receive their salaries on an 
irregular basis. The navy is simply incapable of assuming 
responsibility for all of the expenses, including the mandatory 
prepayment although that is what the guarantee enterprises 
insist on. In a word, a dead end..." 
  Unfortunately, right now no one can say: Ultimately, how 
long 
will this "self-service" maintenance continue? Today it is 
senseless to count on appeals for order that aren't backed up or 
for the accomplishment of obligations. The current 
military-industrial complex's main argument is the economic 
slip-knot that is being increasingly tightened by the 
government. Moreover, many of its enterprises have turned out to 
be isolated from each other by the impenetrable fences of the 
sovereign states. And if we can still somehow solve the problems 
that arise using Russian producers and repairmen, matters are 
significantly more complicated with the "near-abroad". Indeed, 
the unregulated market relations in Russia also engender 
paradoxes. A simple example. A plant that specializes in the 
manufacture of fluorescent bulbs unilaterally reduced deliveries 
to the navy. It seems like a minor detail but try to find a 
replacement for them! A similar situation exists with spare 
parts kits and with many other things. 
  The traditional question: "How can that be?" -- still 
requires a legitimate answer. It's quite obvious that neither 
the navy nor the Ministry of Defense can independently untie 
that knot. But we think that this problem is quite solvable at 
the intergovernmental level. Conclusion of the necessary 
agreements is the only rational solution to the situation today. 
Only, will we be able to find the resources to carry out those 
agreements? 
  We recall that, after the "Komsomolets" tragedy, there were 
many conversations and many decisions were made to improve 
warranty maintenance of submarines that remain unfulfilled. As a 
result, the state of affairs has deteriorated even further 
today. Yes, and how could it be otherwise if the resources that 
are currently being allocated do not cover even minimal 
requirements? In our country at each step we have examples of 
borrowing experience from the West but for some reason this 
approach is not being employed with regard to the navy. For 
example, in the U.S. Navy, the strength of support subunits 
exceeds the number of shipborne specialists by a factor of 5-6. 
In our country, where we traditionally follow our own path, 
previously we did the opposite and even more so right now. In 
one nuclear submarine task force, while following the regulation 
to reduce so-called noncombat subunits, they eliminated the 
coastal base and are disbanding two maintenance crews. Well it 
turns out that sentries, the guard, galley details, policing the 
area, alert duty at the entry control point, patrols, and so on 
and so forth -- all of this will lie on the shoulders of 
submarine combat crews and one more or less important plan 
--preparation for winter -- hangs in the task force commander's 
office in a visible place alongside the BP [operation order] 
plan. And yet hope flickers within me that maybe matters are 
somewhat better in other garrisons? Alas.... 
  "The situation is serious and there is an extreme shortage 
of 
material resources and financing," Rear-Admiral M. Motsak, 
commander of another task force, told me. "We are trying to 
allocate those crumbs that we do have in such a manner as to 
support at least the most combat capable ships. But that is 
difficult to do. We are increasingly delaying routine 
maintenance and the number of submarines with overdue periods 
between repairs is increasing. Today, only one of four warranty 
equipment repair and maintenance organizations is in 
full-fledged operation. But on the other hand, commercial 
structures and small enterprises are growing like mushrooms 
after the rain. These commercial structures and small 
enterprises are splitting off from the ship repair plants that 
are also experiencing hard times. They are enticing the best 
specialists to their organizations. The navy has been compelled 
to turn to their services in order not to remain without any 
repairs at all. And although they are asking high prices for 
work, the quality of repairs is not increasing because of this 
and the time periods for repairs are being continuously dragged 
out. Judge for yourself, under these conditions is it easy to 
maintain the required level of technical readiness of ships? 
  "The duration of submarine service is drastically declining 
as a result of the disruption of their operating cycle (the most 
important element of which is maintenance). We are `doing 
everything we can' to maintain submarines at the combat capable 
level for as long as possible..." 
  "Objectively, the navy's qualitative level has 
deteriorated," 
Nuclear Submarine Task Force Chief of Staff Captain 1st Rank V. 
Avlastimov said. "New models of weapons and equipment have 
nearly stopped entering the inventory. Those that were in the 
developmental stage at one time have remained drawings. Test 
ranges and NII [scientific research institutes] are being closed 
and high-tech production is being shutdown. Promising 
developments and experience and unique specialists are being 
lost. Before our eyes, we are retreating from formerly leading 
positions in this sphere. What will the navy be like tomorrow?" 
  That question is far from rhetorical. According to some 
data, 
in recent years the number of technical developments has been 
reduced by nearly a factor of ten. The most important priorities 
have been lost, for example, in the sphere of the utilization of 
titanium, where domestic shipbuilding had far outstripped 
foreign shipbuilding. We continue to finish building certain 
series of nuclear submarines probably because that is cheaper 
and easier than to completely shutdown production. 
  As for strategic submarines, here the situation is even 
worse. Existing future developments of submarines have 
practically been frozen when the time for medium repair is 
approaching for the submarines that we have in operation and for 
which we do not yet have resources nor do we have resources for 
their modernization. Meanwhile, in accordance with the START 
treaties, the strategic forces naval component is emerging in 
first place. Won't it turn out that Russia will be left without 
its nuclear shield? 
<H5>  ... But We Have Nowhere To Go </H5>
  "How do you like the wardroom?", Captain 2nd Rank S. 
Fedorychev, deputy task force commander for personnel, 
sympathetically asked me. Having noted my embarrassment, he 
cleverly added from the reply: "Of course, the food is terrible 
and, as they say, we are switching over from millet to pearl 
barley. Standards are not being maintained but it's difficult to 
blame the supply people for that -- there's nothing in the 
warehouses. Even if some submarine or other is being prepared to 
put to sea, it is a problem to supply its crew with the most 
basic necessities. There is also a certain "innovation": There 
are frequently shortages in the boxes of provisions that are 
packed at the plants." 
  We sat in a small cabin, we drank tea, and we talked "about 
life" at a leisurely pace. Sergey Anatolyevich has devoted 25 
years of his life to the navy. He has primarily served in the 
surface fleet -- on combatants, on diesel ships, and later -- on 
nuclear submarines. He has performed 12 combat tours. 
  "I have something with which to compare this," continued 
Fedorychev. White-haired, good-natured, and kind, he completely 
corresponded to the customary model of a man whom life has made 
wise. "In general, the people have not changed during this time 
but the attitude toward them has become worse. Many junior 
officers frankly say: You have no place to go, you have already 
served for so long, but we do not want to repeat your path. They 
see quite well in people like me the example of what prospects 
await them. If I am released into the reserve -- where will my 
family and I end up, without housing? Crowd ourselves in with my 
elderly parents? And the majority are finding themselves in that 
situation... That is why people are increasingly leaving the 
navy. 
  "We had Senior Lieutenant Nikolay Matrosov -- commander of 
the mine-torpedo department -- on our submarine. A hard to find 
kind of specialist. And he served well and he showed great 
promise but, having written his request for release, he 
departed. Acoustic Team Commander Captain-Lieutenant Sergey 
Vasilevich is also planning to leave for the civilian sector. 
You could say he is going nowhere, he doesn't have any rear 
services support but even that, in his opinion, is better than 
continuing to serve. Right now it is not prestigious to be a 
submariner and the material position obviously does not 
correspond to the labor spent and to those dangers and 
deprivations that seamen experience. It's not surprising that, 
at the slightest opportunity, officers and warrant officers are 
leaving the navy for business. Yes, that's what I'm saying! My 
son finished school but he doesn't want to hear about any 
advantage whatsoever about becoming a submariner and I myself do 
not wish his fate to repeat mine with the possibility of finding 
himself left with nothing..." 
  Having been silent for a while, Sergey Anatolyevich 
considered it necessary to add: "But then again, no matter how 
much we in the crew argue or are indignant, or how much we 
discuss, when the ship puts to sea -- everything else becomes 
secondary. For the time being, duty and the Fatherland is not an 
empty sound for people. The question is -- for how long? The 
social experience of the older generations is not passing 
without a trace and if today much is being maintained in the old 
mode, it's hard to say what will happen tomorrow..." 
  The cause of that concern is understandable; already right 
now the cadre shortage is tenaciously grasping the throat. The 
loss of the Baku and Sevastopol naval schools hit the Russian 
submarine fleet especially hard. The shortage of people 
naturally is reflected in the combat readiness of ships; before 
putting out to sea, they have to be brought up to full strength 
with the required specialists, having immediately activated 
several crews. The number of temporary duty personnel sometimes 
reaches one fourth of the assigned strength! And, in violation 
of the requirements of guiding documents, replacements and 
transfers are being conducted until the very last moment. 
  Commenting on the situation, Nuclear Submarine Task Force 
Commander Vice-Admiral A. Shevchenko stated in that same vein: 
  "No matter where you go now, we are being held to that old 
strength reserve. But if the state does not change its attitude 
toward defense in the near future, the decline will continue. 
And this will be reflected most of all in cadres -- a real 
collapse can occur in a couple of years. We, military personnel, 
have completely performed our duty but the politicians must also 
understand: If there will be a reliable defense -- there will 
also be strong statehood..." 
  I agreed with Anatoliy Ivanovich that it seems that this 
understanding is already beginning to force its way through. For 
the first time in many years, officers have sensed a real 
increase of their monetary salary. Although also relative -- 
with the current insane inflation! -- but still an improvement. 
The long-awaited law "On the Status of Servicemen" has been 
adopted. The law is good but (literally everyone has talked 
about that!) the overwhelming mass of its provisions still 
remain only on paper. 
  "Why is this occurring? Well, because the law does not have 
the proper legal and financial support," thinks Northern Fleet 
Deputy Commander for Personnel Rear-Admiral M. Sviridov. "Let's 
take a specific example like supplying garrisons. If you believe 
the law, servicemen and their families can obtain goods and 
foodstuffs at beneficial prices through the military sales store 
system. But to do that, it seems the appropriate state 
subsidies, credits, and the state order are needed, in a word -- 
financial support. In the absence of that, we have what is 
available: Commercial sales have inundated the navy with 
alcoholic beverages, chewing gum and expensive, low-quality, 
consumer goods. In order to survive, the military sales store is 
also increasing prices which are becoming even higher than in 
ordinary state stores. What are the benefits here? 
  "Or," continued Mikhail Ivanovich, "one more problem -- 
transportation. According to the law, servicemen are supposed to 
get free travel on all types of city and municipal public 
transportation. But in our area, people are paying full price on 
inter-garrison routes to get to their duty locations: We don't 
have our own buses and we have to lease them from oblast 
transportation organizations. Where do we get the money to pay? 
There is only one solution -- pass the hat." 
  I will be frank: Only the lack of housing and the illusory 
hope for improvement of their situation holds many of the 
officers whom I've managed to meet on this temporary duty 
assignment in the service. But increasingly after release into 
the reserve, officers have been compelled to leave the military 
garrisons where their service that was full of concerns and 
deprivations occurred... 
<H5>  A Little Bit Goes a Long Way </H5>
  I drove with apprehension into this military garrison where 
the submariners' families live: I had spent quite a bit of my 
childhood here. Much had changed in a little over 20 years. The 
garrison had deteriorated since that time and had become sort of 
lacking in comforts. Alongside the apartment buildings that had 
still not been subjected to the test of time are empty 
five-story buildings with gaping windows without panes, piles of 
garbage on untidy small streets, the dilapidated Officers' Club, 
and the boarded up swimming pool. There was the mark of 
desolation and neglect on everything. But there was a time when 
Party and state leaders were brought here on "tours", to a 
village that shined with cleanliness and tidiness. Since that 
time, as the village was transferred to the balance sheet of the 
local Soviet, it has not become a real caring owner. More 
precisely, there aren't resources for its full-fledged 
maintenance. Maybe the seamen could also help but they 
themselves, as they say, have deficiency after deficiency. What 
resources can reach the village right now, say, if we can't 
always manage to paint the submarines? 
  Degrading poverty, like rust, is eating away all of the 
pores 
of the navy organism. It would seem that the nuclear submarines 
that are at the piers would be provided with the complete 
standard of high pressure air, feed water, steam and 
electricity... That is in theory. In fact, the submariners 
frequently have to count on only their own resources, more 
precisely, on the ship's service life. Mechanisms are wearing 
out much earlier than they should and numerous breakdowns are 
becoming inevitable. 
  "There are submarines," says Nuclear Submarine Commander 
Captain 1st Rank M. Ivanisov, "that have fired `bubbles' for an 
entire year due to the shortage of practice torpedoes. Torpedo 
training schools and the struggles for survival of the ship are 
being lost..." 
  "Recently, the intensity of cruises, including combat 
service, has been reduced by a factor of 2-2.5," says another 
Nuclear Submarine Commander Captain 1st Rank O. Gorelov. "The 
cruise time per year for any crews does not exceed 2-3 weeks. 
And actual sea cruises are the primary type of training for us." 
  "Today we are striving to resolve on shore part of the 
problems associated with the limited number of times ships put 
to sea -- by training crews in simulators. But we need to 
improve the MTB [logistic and technical support facilities]; 
that is, to once again invest resources to do that," Northern 
Fleet Headquarters Department Chief Captain 1st Rank M. Kolbunov 
comments on the situation. "But where do we get the resources? 
There is primarily obsolete equipment at the task forces' 
training centers and we can't even talk about computers. And in 
order to acquire them -- you yourself can imagine what kind of 
resources we need to invest. We don't have money for ordinary 
light bulbs. Previously there was a powerful training center in 
Estonia's Paldiski where crews underwent between-cruise training 
twice a year. Now the center is not functioning. They plan to 
withdraw all of its equipment which is very complicated and 
terribly expensive." 
  Currently all the problems of basic support of the navy's 
vital activities have deteriorated to the maximum extent 
possible. Say, we need to reload torpedoes but, as frequently 
happens now, there isn't a crane. But the neighboring 
construction unit has one. Well, the nuclear submarine commander 
goes over to beg to use it. Of course, they simply won't give 
him the crane just for that but they can probably come to an 
agreement for a couple liters of alcoholic beverages or for two 
or three boxes of food. It can also be carried to absurdity. The 
one and only tugboat, and it is not always in working order, 
serves an entire task force of attack submarines. But according 
to the standard, three tugs are required to moor other 
submarines. But then again, if there were three, it still isn't 
known which KPD [efficiency] they would manage to utilize: Right 
now diesel fuel is worth its weight in gold. An important 
problem is to tow a nuclear submarine to the neighboring bay (to 
do that, in turn you need to refuel the tug). It's sometimes 
easier and faster to start the nuclear reactor which they 
occasionally do. A truly Russian scale! 
  It's not surprising that everyday life has also turned out 
to 
be in an extraordinarily neglected state. The temperature in 
some barracks did not rise above 10 degrees all last winter. All 
of the crew's officers have one cabin to work in and the warrant 
officers don't even have one. Essentially, the barracks has been 
turned into an ordinary flophouse. Poverty "has been able to 
touch" even here. They don't even have any cleaning supplies. 
When one of the submarines left on an endurance cruise, a 
surprise awaited its crew: The base had allocated a total of 1.5 
boxes of soap! They intended, as they say -- to make a little 
bit go a long way... 
  Before leaving the military garrison where the submariners' 
families live, I came to pay my respects at the monument erected 
on the summit of a small hill in honor of the seamen who died on 
the nuclear submarine "Komsomolets". Just like the crucifixion, 
it's as if it floated in the cold sky that was covered by storm 
clouds. I thought that the submariners, true sons of the 
Fatherland, had ascended to Calvary on behalf of it. Their 
comrades serve today for the sake of the Homeland's welfare. 
Will Mother Russia make it so that this service requires not 
titanic efforts from Northern Fleet seamen to overcome 
frequently unresolved problems but would make them happy and 
would nurture pride in the fact that they are defending a truly 
great state?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article, under the rubric: "Official </F>
Department": "Naval Press Center Statement"] 
  [Text] The Naval Press Center has been authorized to 
disseminate the following statement as a result of articles in 
the mass media on radioactive waste dumping problems: 
  The decision on radioactive waste dumping at sea from naval 
facilities was made at the end of the 1950's, based on the 
results of a series of scientific investigations and while 
considering the practices of the majority of "nuclear" countries 
that existed at that time. The organization of dumping wastes at 
sea stipulated the reduction to a minimum of the possible 
unfavorable impact of the wastes on the population as a whole 
and on the critical group of the population who reside in 
coastal areas. During the resolution of organized issues of 
waste dumping at sea, a policy was also conducted toward the 
reduction of the possible unfavorable impact of the wastes on 
the environment. Dumping standards had a significant hygienic 
reserve and took into account the accumulation of radionuclides 
by aquatic life and their entry into the human organism as food. 
Permissible concentrations of man-made radionuclides in seawater 
were adopted that were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than 
permissible concentrations for drinking water. Based upon the 
results of a number of expeditionary studies of the radioactive 
situation in waste dump areas, the actual concentrations of 
radionuclides in seawater turned out to be lower than the 
permissible levels by 2-3 orders of magnitude. They also did not 
detect any radioactive contamination of aquatic life. 
  The practice of dumping wastes at sea was the only possible 
step that supports the vital activities of ships with nuclear 
power plants in view of the absence of effective processes for 
reprocessing radioactive wastes. France and Great Britain adhere 
to a similar practice for dealing with radioactive wastes until 
the present time. 
  Since 1991, the Navy has ceased dumping solid radioactive 
wastes at sea. The dumping of liquid wastes has been reduced to 
the lowest possible level. 
  Based upon the results of radiation-hygienic and 
radioecological research of solid and liquid radioactive waste 
dumping areas that have been conducted by the Navy and also by a 
number of scientific research institutions (RAN GEOKhI [Russian 
Academy of Sciences Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical 
Chemistry imeni V.I. Vernadskiy] and "Tayfun" NPO [Scientific 
Production Association]) during the period from 1967 to 1992, no 
cases were detected of dangerous radioactive contamination of 
the sea environment both directly in the dumping areas and also 
in the water areas adjacent to them. The levels of radioactive 
contamination of the seas of the North and the Far East do not 
indicate any dangerous increase of the content of radionuclides 
in seawater. Specifically, the concentrations of Strontium-90 in 
the surface waters of the Barents Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the 
Pacific Ocean (the coastal waters of Eastern Kamchatka) total 
1.6x10[.sup]-11[/] Ki/l [Curies per liter], 
1.0x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies per liter, and 
0.9x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies per liter, respectively, which is 
four times lower than the concentration of Strontium-90 in the 
surface waters of the Baltic Sea (4.4x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies 
per liter). 
  At the international conference of experts on the assessment 
of the existing and potential consequences of dumping 
radioactive wastes in Arctic waters that took place in Oslo in 
February 1993 in which the representatives of 12 countries and 
also IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts 
participated, based on the materials examined, they arrived at 
the conclusion that there is inadequate evidence of a dangerous 
impact of sources of radioactive contamination on the maritime 
environment of the Arctic Seas at the present time, except for 
the entry of radioactive wastes from Western European spent 
nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and global fallout of the 
products of nuclear detonations. 
  An expeditionary study of waste dumping areas in the Karsk 
Sea was conducted on the "Kovrayskiy" OIS [Experimental Research 
Ship] to assess the impact of radioactive wastes on the naval 
environment during the period from 16 August through 10 
September 1993. The expedition's work was conducted by experts 
of Russian Federation profile scientific-research institutes 
("Radiyevyy Institute" NPO and "Kurchatovskiy Institute" RNTs) 
and of a number of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
institutions. At the present time, the initial processing of 
samples is being conducted and an express-report has been 
prepared based upon the expedition's results. The amount of 
research accomplished permits us to arrive at the conclusion 
that the radioecological situation in the areas studied is 
without anomalies and can be characterized as normal. There have 
been no cases detected of radionuclides leaking into the 
environment from dumped containers. The yield of gamma radiation 
doses on the surface of the water area, on land surrounding the 
bays and on the ground does not exceed background levels and is 
4-12 microroentgens per hour. Concentrations of Cesium-137 in 
seawater do not exceed the sensitivity of instrument measurement 
methods (2x10[.sup]-12[/] Curies per liter). An international 
expedition that operated on the "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh" NIS 
[Scientific Research Ship] obtained similar results. Final data 
on the content of radionuclides in seawater, algae, ground and 
sea organisms will be reported after radiochemical and 
spectrometric research has been conducted in the laboratories of 
the institutes that participated in the expeditionary research. 
  Two international expeditions (Russian-Norwegian -- on the 
"Viktor Buynitskiy" NIS and on the Jigofs [Transliterated] 
project -- on the "Dmitriy Mendeleyev" NIS) are continuing the 
study of the radioecological situation in the Northern Seas. 
Expedition work will be concluded at the end of October 1993. 
The final results of the radioecological research can be 
obtained after processing, under laboratory conditions, of the 
samples of the environment that were taken and also after the 
comparison, summarization and analysis of the data obtained 
during the course of the study of maritime areas which will 
require a certain amount of time. 
  It seems to be advisable to note that this problem, being 
universal, can be resolved only at the state level within the 
framework of the realization of a purposeful Russian Federation 
State Program for dealing with radioactive wastes and spent 
nuclear materials and for writing them off and dumping them.

Captain 1st Rank, Lecturer S. Smirnov, under the rubric: 
"Questions of Theory": "Electronic Support to Combat Command and 
Control"] 
  [Text] Electronic situation coverage occupies a special 
place in the series of measures for the support of command and 
control of combat and everyday activities of naval ships. The 
sphere of its operation extends in space from the surface of the 
sea to its bottom, on the one hand, and to near space, on the 
other hand. 
  At the present time, various guiding documents and official 
publications contain a certain inconsistency in the 
interpretation of the concept "electronic support", including 
the electronic situation coverage process as the initial 
component of this type of support. At the same time, there are 
certain theoretical and practical accumulations here. As a 
result, normalization of the existing views is becoming an 
urgent task. In our opinion, we can most graphically present the 
entire process of electronic situation coverage in the form of 
the structural diagrams that are depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-18A>           Figure 1. A Graphic Algorithm of the </FIG>




  It is customary to proceed from the fact that, as shown in 
Figure 1, this process objectively consists of the successive 
resolution of the following missions at any level of command and 
control (of a ship and its weapons, a task group, a task force, 
etc.): 
  1. Continuous surveillance of the surrounding situation, 
using electronic detection and identification systems, that 
consists of three stages -- target search, target detection and 
identification and also target tracking during a specific period 
of time. 
  2. Gathering information on the situation and the reciprocal 
exchange of information among task force (task group) ships and 
also with external sources via radio nets and radio lines of 
automated VZOI systems. There are two stages present here: 
Gathering information on the situation from internal ship 
sources and the reciprocal exchange of information with other 
sources. 
  3. Processing all initial information that has been obtained 
on the situation (What? Where? In what quantity detected?); 
contact plotting (electronic tracking) of target movement with 
detection of target motion and maneuvering and formation of the 
target history in MRO systems or in STsVS [specialized digital 
computer system] in BIUS [Combat Information Command and Control 
System] loops or in BITs of ships; identification of all 
information on the situation and depiction of models of tactical 
situations with their extrapolation for the immediate future. 
That is, operational data is divided into three stages -- 
initial, secondary and tertiary processing of information on the 
situation. 
  4. Analysis of the situation that has developed in the BITs 
of ships. (An assessment of mutual location, target motion and 
maneuvering, and detection of the composition of the enemy 
forces is the first stage; discovery of the operating tactics, 
the degree of threat and the enemy's intentions is the second 
stage). 
  5. A report from the BITs of ships and presentation of the 
initial and processed, analyzed information on the situation to 
the command authorities in graphic form on ARM [automated work 
station] screens; to the GKPs [Primary Control Station] of 
ships, the command posts of task forces, and to other command 
posts -- consumers of information on the situation. The initial 
abbreviated report with the information: What has been detected 
and is being observed, the numerical composition of the group 
targets and where they are located -- coordinate data; a more 
precise report with indication of certain target motion and 
maneuvering parameters; and, finally, a complete report with the 
addition of target tactical composition, the proposed nature of 
operations and the degree of threat, and revealed enemy 
intentions. 
  Based upon the theoretical bases that assume the gradual 
nature of the resolution of each electronic situation coverage 
mission that is depicted in Figure 1, the algorithm reveals 
existing communications and dependence between the stages 
examined above and displays a definite symmetry in the dynamics 
of its implementation. 
  Based upon the results of the electronic situation coverage, 
information processing support must be attained using the MRO 
systems, combat information command and control system loops, 
BITs equipment or PU-N recommendations. Taking these into 
account, the Primary Control Station and other command posts of 
ships or the task group or task force command post make 
decisions on the command and control of the electronic situation 
coverage systems themselves, electronic jamming systems, weapons 
systems, ships, task forces and coordinating forces. The process 
of carrying out each of the possible decisions also entails a 
number of consecutive conditional stages. The majority of these 
stages, in turn, require electronic support through the 
utilization of target identification and target designation 
systems and schemes, weapons fire control systems, electronic 
warfare systems, shipborne aircraft take off, flight, vectoring 
and landing control systems, diagrams and shipborne combat 
information command and control system loops, navigational 
radars, etc. The composition of the command and control 
missions, based upon which the recommendations indicated above 
can be developed according to the electronic situation coverage 
and also the primary stages of electronic support of the 
resolution of these missions is shown in Figure 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-19A>           Figure 2. Recommendations for Combat </FIG>




  Consequently, based upon electronic situation coverage, we 
can totally achieve the required level of electronic support of 
command and control during combat and everyday activities of 
ships and task forces (Fig. 3) ONLY as a result of ALL of the 
examined processes. What has been set forth above is called upon 
to ameliorate to a certain extent the existing inconsistencies 
in understanding and interpreting the issues of "electronic 
support" and "electronic situation coverage". 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-20A>           Figure 3. The Content of Electronic </FIG>




  In conclusion, it is appropriate to point out that the 
examined provisions can be accepted as a sort of methodological 
basis of the scientific and academic discipline being formed -- 
"Electronic Support of the Command and Control of Ships, Their 
Weapons, and Coordinating Forces". In our opinion, this 
discipline must follow the content and patterns of the 
resolution of various electronic situation coverage missions and 
electronic support of combat command and control on the whole 
and, through its stages, the patterns of interrelationships and 
the dependencies of these stages. The development of 
recommendations of a technical and organizational context for 
the effective electronic support of combat command and control 
of naval ships and task forces must be its practical solution.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kiselev: "You Will Learn of Their Fate </F>
from the Order"] 
  [Text] ITAR-TASS has sent a report: reorganization of 
the Armed Forces' mass media has begun. Which is not entirely 
correct. They have simply begun speaking about this at last. But 
the reformers had a different intent. To prepare a draft order 
by the minister of defense without unnecessary fanfare. He would 
sign it hastily without considering it carefully. And the deed 
was done, the reorganization took place. 
  Who needs this? One viewpoint. "We have three 
central organs for the Ministry of Defense--KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the 
weekly SYN OTECHESTVA, the semimonthly journal ARMIYA, and 13 
travel and other magazines. Altogether, 102 editions. At the 
same time, for example, the Pentagon publishes about 400 
magazines and 1,000 newspapers. In the FRG they publish about 
100 military newspapers and magazines, and Britain publishes 
more than 110. A subsidy of 1,241,462,000 rubles [R] is 
required. As a comparison, it costs the state budget roughly 
R1.5 billion to publish just the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA alone." 
(From an interview last year with Vladimir Kosarev, chief of the 
Information and Press Administration of the Ministry of Defense.) 
  The following episode took place last year in one of the MO 
[Ministry of Defense] collegium meetings. "Is a large amount of 
money required to support our press?" the minister asked. They 
answered him. "And how many houses can be built with this?" 
Pavel Grachev asked. "Three or four," the general in charge of 
finances reported. "Well, we should build them," the minister 
sighed. "The housing for officers is really a catastrophe." As 
we know, any sigh by the chief is interpreted as a directive in 
the Army. 
  An arithmetic lesson. Speaking of the need for 
reform, all the military officials say the primary cause is the 
shortage of money (at the same time, though, they prefer to call 
it "optimizing" the press or "putting it in order"), stating 
more specifically that most of the funds go toward the wages of 
editorial staff collectives. The conclusion is obvious--to be 
squeezed. Some of the large-edition publications will really 
disappear soon. This amounts to kopecks, however. You cannot 
shut down the district newspapers. They decided to fill up the 
Ministry of Defense's empty purse at the cost of the Moscow 
editions. Asking that his name not be given, an officer from the 
Information and Press Administration said the finance people 
simply ordered straight out at first: leave only one newspaper 
and one journal. But their ardor was restrained. It looks as if 
only the SYN OTECHESTVA and six magazines are being sent for the 
slaughter in the end. But two new ones are being established (we 
have to pay to order them, by the way). 
  No one could tell me if there is a substantial economic gain 
from such deviations. There are probably no such assessments at 
all. But according to my estimates, it is very questionable. The 
most profitable military publications which are issued regularly 
and are not losing subscribers are on the list of the ones 
curtailed. At the same time, CHEST IMEYU (formerly SOVETSKIY 
VOIN), a literary and artistic journal with excessively inflated 
staffs (55 officers and 63 employees, with 12 correspondents 
stationed in the districts), turned out only six issues last 
year and is up to its ears in debt. The supplement to CHEST 
IMEYU--BOYEVOY TOVARISHCH--has not been issued for a year. 
Aleksey Petrenko, who heads the supplement, implores: "Dismiss 
us in the staff reduction." "No, stay," they respond. 
  Altogether, about 100 officer-journalists are being released 
in the publications being abolished. A few more than the number 
left in the Information and Press Administration. But not many 
more. Even during the times of the unforgettable GlavPUR [Main 
Political Directorate], the octopus which squeezed the Armed 
Forces, the entire military press was headed by a department 
with under 10 soldiers. But now the official category of chief 
of the administration is a lieutenant general, his deputy is a 
major general, and the heads of departments are colonels, who 
are in charge of more colonels. According to my information, the 
administration is staffed by 62 persons. There are 40, according 
to its chief. Although this does not change the point. 
  The prime mover of the reform. When I expressed my 
doubts to one of the administration's employees, he just smiled: 
"Everything runs smoothly as long as our lady is with us." The 
boss of the military press today is Yelena Agapova. The new 
administration--information and press--was established in the 
Ministry of Defense precisely because she asked for it. 
According to Grachev's order, "The chief of the administration 
is subordinate to the Russian Federation minister of defense's 
assistant for public and press relations," that is, to Yelena 
Aleksandrovna. She was formerly the deputy editor in chief of 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Her subordinate, Vladimir Kosarev, who has 
headed the administration and received his general's shoulder 
boards with the speed of lightning, also comes from KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA. 
  And there are no mysteries for military readers with respect 
to CHEST IMEYU. When Nikolay Ivanov no longer wished to head the 
journal after the tragic October, and Aleksandr Tkachev, who 
headed the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA cultural department, took his place, 
Agapova was still a reporter for it. 
  So the encirclement is being reinforced, step by step, "with 
her own people." As General Kosarev explained it to me, his 
administration will decide which publications to shut down and 
whom to appoint as editors of the new ones. They do not even 
intend to consult with the Ministry of Defense collegium about 
the publications being abolished (they include two central 
organs of the Ministry of Defense: SYN OTECHESTVA and ARMIYA, 
the only military-political journal in the Armed Forces). "This 
matter is too minor to divert the collegium's attention." 
  But I know not all the minister's deputies and commanders in 
chief of the service branches are prepared to be content with 
the role of extras.

"Reform of Military Publications: Official Version and Hidden 
Agenda"] 
  [Text] In accordance with an order from Russia's minister 
of defense a reorganization--or rather, a reduction--of 
educational structures is being conducted in the army. A number 
of the functions of educational structures are being transferred 
to other agencies and services. For example, law enforcement and 
the strengthening of discipline will now be headed by... The 
Directorate of Routine and Service of the General Staff. 
  The military mass media are also being reformed. The fairly 
rare ranks of military journals (there are only 14 with a 
single, combined edition of around 200,000 copies) is being 
reduced by half. Even publications popular not only with the 
military but also the civilian readership, such as ARMIYA, the 
central organ of Russia's Ministry of Defense, AVIATSIYA I 
KOSMONAVTIKA, TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE and the weekly SYN 
OTECHESTVA are going "under the knife." Even at a time of 
massive loss of readership, these publications have kept their 
subscribers. ARMIYA has even increased its portion. 
  The magazines VOYENNYY VESTNIK and VOYENNO-EKONOMICHESKIY 
ZHURNAL with their great popularity and rich history are also 
undergoing reform. As is usually the case in the military 
structure, this is being done without taking into account the 
opinion of those assigned the functions of founders and without 
the agreement of the journalist teams. 
  The official version of the reform is that the Ministry of 
Defense wants to establish a more optimal structure of the 
military mass media. It is also prompted, as it were, by the 
informational processes occurring in the society and by the 
reform of the armed forces themselves. The main factor, however, 
is the fact that the funds for publishing the journals are 
lacking, and they have to economize. 
  At first glance it all seems convincing. Especially for one 
who has no concept of what is taking place in the military's top 
echelons today and believes sacredly that the taxpayers' money 
to support the armed forces is being spent prudently and 
thriftily. 
  The journalists themselves believe that there are other 
reasons for the reform of military publications, however. They 
are revealed in part by an article published in the 2 February 
issue of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. The author, military journalist 
A. Petrov, writes of the danger of eliminating the weekly SYN 
OTECHESTVA. The weekly (like a number of military 
magazines--N.G.) was not included in the catalog for the first 
half of this year, which actually means that it no longer exists. 
  SYN OTECHESTVA is well known in the nation. It has been 
published since 1812. The weekly provides an interesting and 
vital account of the armed forces. Like the military magazines, 
it performs an important role in the information flow. It firmly 
holds to a course of military patriotic indoctrination of the 
army and navy youth and contributes to the shaping of the best 
qualities of defenders of the homeland in the servicemen. 
  The weekly may now suffer the sad fate of its companion 
journals. The author of a KOMSOMOLKA article bitterly laments 
the fact that the number of military newspapers and magazines is 
being cut, but not the army of press officials. That army 
actually exists. Judge for yourself. During the communist era 
the mass media were run by a press section of the well-known 
GlavPUR [Main Political Directorate of the Revolutionary 
Military Council], fewer than a dozen members (four officers, 
two Soviet Army employees, headed by a major general). 
  The military press is run today by an entire directorate of 
information and the press of the Russian Federation's Ministry 
of Defense. Major-General Vladimir Kosarev, its chief, naturally 
has a higher position rating (lieutenant-general). Like any 
self-respecting directorate this one has several sections and 
groups headed by colonels. Each section has two or three 
officers, of course. 
  Nor could we fail to mention the press centers of the 
branches of forces, troop arms, districts, groups of forces and 
fleets, which also contain not just a single dozen press 
officials. 
  And so, the military press is being "optimized" through a 
reduction of its small staff. 
  But even this is not the whole truth, as they say. 
  Many reformers like to refer to Western models--when it is 
to 
their advantage, of course. Let me make reference to some 
foreign examples. The Pentagon publishes around 400 magazines 
and 1,000 newspapers with a total circulation of 12.5 million 
copies. In Germany there are around 100 military publications; 
in Great Britain, more than 110. We have only 102. To the same 
extent we accede to the leading countries of the world in the 
concentration of the mass media on the armed forces in the 
information arena. And is it not strange that we are presently 
artificially cutting these means, actually constricting the 
sphere of influence upon military personnel? 
  The army is rightly considered to be one of the guarantors 
of 
the state's stability. This accounts for the desire of 
far-sighted leaders to strengthen not only its structure but 
also its spirit, to see to the moral and spiritual state of the 
servicemen. The military press is also expected to perform this 
mission. Will it be capable of doing this effectively, however, 
after it is reformed? 
  In an interview with the magazine ARMIYA, Major-General V. 
Kosarev commented that the military press is living through far 
from the best of times. According to him, this is primarily due 
to lack of financing. But our directorate has been given hope, 
they say, in seeking a way out, a way to get the money, in close 
contact with the Main Directorate of the Budget and Financing.... 
  And they have found it. They are cutting the popular 
publications which do not require significant outlays, while 
retaining the unprofitable ones with small circulations. Where 
is the logic? If, as V. Kosarev asserts, the solution to the 
problem lies in funds, then how does one explain the fact that 
for almost a year now the magazine CHEST IMEYU (the present name 
of SOVETSKIY VOIN) has not been published while continuing to 
exist in good standing? And its staff has more than 100 members, 
55 of them officers. This is truly a "golden magazine." But 
inaccessible to the reader, and not just due to the high 
subscription price. The main cause of the "inaccessibility" is 
otherwise. Last year the subscribers received only 6 of 12 
issues. Incidentally, without any kind of explanation or 
compensation. Furthermore a subsidy of 40 million rubles was 
required to publish these six issues. 
  It would be difficult to say how much will be needed this 
year. Obviously, no less than required to publish the reduced 
list of military journals. Nonetheless, the matter of 
reorganizing and particularly of eliminating the former 
SOVETSKIY VOIN is not at issue. Furthermore, plans are in the 
air at the "upper levels" for publishing this journal jointly 
with a Finnish printing enterprise. Can this really cost the 
Ministry of Defense less in the present situation? 
  If "money determines all," do the reformers of the military 
press know how to count it? Their most potent argument is that 
two publications will replace the seven being eliminated. They 
will take on the functions of the former publications. 
  The number of slots in the military journalists' shop will 
indeed be reduced somewhat. Along with this, however, outlays 
for publishing the new journals will undoubtedly substantially 
increase various registration costs, subscription fees and so 
forth. Most important is the fact that these publications will 
turn out to be impotent and ineffective, therefore unprofitable. 
  In general the reform contains a number of paradoxes. Take 
just the journal ARMIYA. Its editorial board includes Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, chief of General Staff Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, advisers to the President of the Russian Federation, 
and the current chairman of the Defense Committee of the State 
Duma, Sergey Yushenkov. One has to ask whether the elimination 
of ARMIYA does not mean that the editorial board has "led the 
magazine astray"? If that is the case, however, then where is 
the guilt of the editorial board whose fate is presently in 
question? 
  All of this raises the question: What is the objective of 
the 
reform of the military press? Common sense suggests that no 
reform is justifiable if it is detrimental to the interests of 
the people and the cause. A reorganization of the military press 
is inevitable, of course. It is politically justified, 
scientifically substantiated and economically expedient. But do 
the higher military officials understand this? 
  And all the time someone continues with enviable persistence 
to destroy the military press and the informational arena in the 
armed forces. It would be difficult to predict the effects of 
this destruction. I shall risk one suggestion, however. If you 
agree that a good half of the military members were backers of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during the parliamentary elections of 
December 1993, how many of them might there be by the time of 
the presidential elections?

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Yevgeniy Olkov, chief, Firefighting </F>
and Rescue Service, Central Missile Fuel and Fuel Directorate, 
Ministry of Defense, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Petr 
Altunin: "Standing on a Rim of Fire: More Frequent Fires Causing 
Alarm"; date and place not given; first paragraph is KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA introduction] 
  [Text] Colonel Yevgeniy Olkov is chief of the 
Firefighting and Rescue Service, Central Missile Fuel and Fuel 
Directorate, MO [Ministry of Defense]. He is devoted to his work 
and a patriot to his service. Below are his thoughts on this 
service which he expressed in an interview granted in response 
to a request submitted by the editors. 
  [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, if you do not mind, I will 
start off with an old humorous saying: "Firemen do nothing but 
fall into and out of snoozing." 
  [Olkov] There is an element of truth in that saying. The 
truth is, it came about at one time in a rural area, where long 
intervals would pass before a fire would break out. People were 
lulled into a false sense of security, and firefighters 
themselves would become lax. However, someone eventually would 
take it into his head to "put the torch" to something, and a 
breeze would come along to help the fire burn down half a 
village. 
  Today, a time of technical revolution, the situation is 
different. At one time, the means of starting a fire were a 
match or flintstone. Now, no matter where you go, there are 
these means: electricity, gas, fuel, oils. Just look at the 
numbers: There are 5.5 million fires occurring every year in the 
world; that is more than 500 fires an hour. In this connection, 
incidences of fire in industrially advanced countries are 
increasing by 5 percent a year, with the damage caused growing 
by 10 percent. People lose their lives. In the month of January 
in Moscow alone there were 34 deaths and 37 persons suffering 
burn injuries. 
  [Altunin] It may be said that your service is highly 
involved 
with fires, what with fuel stored in depots and bases and highly 
flammable liquids present there. How do you cope with that? 
  [Olkov] It is not easy. What we have is described by the 
words in the song: "We are standing on a rim of fire." We - 
firefighters and fuel people - are subjected to conditions 
peculiar to us. While most people can get along with putting out 
fires with water, we have in our inventory special apparatus and 
means, equipment to lift and deliver foam, foam generators, and 
various powders. In addition, we are organized differently. For 
example, take the mutual cooperation with firefighting teams of 
the MVD, activities which are governed strictly and responsibly 
in compliance with the respective orders issued by Russia's 
ministers of defense and internal affairs. Plans for combined 
operations also exist. 
  It is quite a matter for firefighters to work in casemate 
tanks. They use special tools - ones that do not produce sparks. 
In the former ZakVO [Transcaucasus Military District], for 
example, why did a fire and then an explosion occur in a 
casemate? Safety rules were not observed. One enlisted man died, 
three suffered burns of various degrees of severity, and the 
fuel burned up. 
  We are involved with lightning protection. To do this work, 
one must possess knowledge and know how to perform special 
calculations. But what can happen? Commanders, in their desire 
to "take their chances" in the good old Russian way, weld some 
pieces of a pipe together and stick it into the ground without 
much ado. This was the case in the ZakVO when lightning entered 
a casemate space to set off saturated fuel vapors, thus wreaking 
havoc on a fuel tank. 
  We also provide static electricity protection for filling 
and 
draining devices, pipelines, and pumping and storage tank 
facilities. This also pertains to a fuel truck, which should 
drag a chain on the ground. 
  [Altunin] Is there something new with which to extinguish 
fires? 
  [Olkov] The traditional substances are the chemical and 
air-mechanical foam mixtures. At our recent training sessions 
held in St. Petersburg, we demonstrated the Shlem 
fire-extinguishing substance, a "light water" type, which is 
delivered by hose directed to the base of the tank, directly to 
the fuel layer. Combustion abatement of the kerosene in the 25 
cubic meter tank started five minutes after inflammation (the 
same time required for firetrucks to arrive), with the flames 
extinguished in one minute. 
  What is noteworthy here is that the new substance is simple, 
inexpensive, and, most important, the fluorine-containing foam 
is inert with respect to petroleum products, does not mix with 
the latter, is not contaminated by hydrocarbons, and does not 
harm the environment. 
  [Altunin] How do you organize your work? 
  [Olkov] We observe all the rules. We mount firefighting 
guards to provide a 24-hour watch; they maintain a log by 
entering into the latter all their observations and call out a 
firefighting team in the event a fire breaks out. If an 
occurrence is serious, they contact local teams and report to me. 
  [Altunin] Have there been any serious occurrences recently? 
  [Olkov] Knock on wood, no. Since I took over my post - in 
1989 -there have been no major fires. 
  [Altunin] How demanding are you of commanders in your 
inspections of fire safety in military units? 
  [Olkov] We demand, without exception, that fuel depots and 
bases be equipped with fire warning systems; aboveground tanks, 
with stationary fire extinguishing equipment; and that 
firefighting teams be kept up to strength. 
  Nonetheless, Minister of Defense Order No 450 presently in 
effect is often violated. Teams are made to do irrelevant jobs 
and trucks are used to deliver water for flushing drainage 
systems. There is poor supervision over manpower required for 
observing monitoring devices and checking on the condition of 
electric power systems. 
  I tell you frankly that everything depends upon the 
commander. For example, Colonels A. Makarov and A. Kustov and 
Lieutenant Colonel A. Remeshevskiy took over facilities where 
there were many violations, but they soon took matters in hand 
such that their bases are in excellent shape with respect to 
fire safety. This cannot be said in the case of the enterprises 
commanded by officers A. Pobegayev and V. Bogatov. 
  My subordinates and I accept no compromises in our 
inspections - that is the kind of service in which we are. All 
one need do is realize that a single spark is sufficient to 
start a flame, and a big one, at that! 
  [Altunin] Does the Central Directorate's leadership support 
you in your demands? 
  [Olkov] Absolutely. And in deed, not word. The directorate 
chief, among other things, remains constantly in strict 
compliance with the defense minister's order, which stipulates 
that fire safety constitutes a major criterion in performance 
evaluation. Any unit given the "unsatisfactory" rating is rated 
"unsatisfactory" in general, regardless of the ratings it earns 
in other areas of activity. 
  [Altunin] Are there any problems? 
  [Olkov] The principal one is that of understrength 
firefighting teams. The defense minister's order calls for at 
least 12 men per team, but some of them consist of only four. 
How much can be done with that kind of manpower? Putting out a 
"small" fire, perhaps. We are thinking about modern firefighting 
teams in garrisons and introducing alternative service 
(something which does not yet exist) - something must be done. 
  [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, now for the last question. 
Many 
servicemen have an automobile, dacha, or garage, and they 
constantly face a problem: Where and how to store fuel? 
  [Olkov] I am fully aware of their difficulties; it is a fact 
that motor fuel prices are rising every month and everyone 
wishes to stock up. The men often store fuel in amounts you 
could not imagine. They forget about safety measures, and the 
consequences are fires. Just look at Moscow, at its fire-damaged 
balconies and burned-down garages; they are places where fuel is 
traditionally stored. 
  The fire safety rules (PPB) strictly forbid the storing of 
fuel-filled containers on balconies, loggias, and in corridors. 
Storage in garages is permitted, but in amounts not exceeding 20 
kg of motor fuel and 5 kg of oil in metal (never polyethylene) 
containers that are tightly sealed. 
  It is forbidden to paint motor vehicles in parking areas or 
garages, refuel vehicles, wash parts in kerosene or gasoline, 
and dump used petroleum waste products into sewer systems or in 
the proximity of a garage. 
  In the case of dachas and small houses located at small 
garden plots, fuel may be stored only in facilities so 
designated, with the metal containers tightly sealed, in amounts 
up to 10 kg. In this connection, it must be kept in mind that 
the use of gasoline in kerosene, Primus, and 
pressurized-kerosene stoves is strictly forbidden. The approved 
product is lighting-grade kerosene, which is sold in special 
outlets located in villages and rural settlements.

under the "Arsenal" rubric: "An Essential Item"] 
  [Text] We recently (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA No 14, 1994) presented 
information on field service vehicle MTP-A4, which is designed 
for field servicing and evacuating disabled heavy vehicles. This 
present article deals with another "essential item" - one 
employed in the event of breakdown of lighter vehicles. The 
MTP-A2 is used when it is necessary to render assistance to 
drivers by eliminating malfunctions of vehicles belonging to the 
families UAZ, GAZ, ZIL, Ural, KamAZ, and MAZ; supply the 
vehicles with fuel, oil, and automotive fluids; and, if 
necessary, recover a mired vehicle or set one on its wheels. It 
can also tow immobilized vehicles weighing up to 10 tonnes by 
means of a tow bar or by employing the semi-loaded technique.

standard winch; lifting device (manipulator); devices to tow a 
vehicle by means of tow bar or semi-loaded technique; ground 
anchors; repair and grappling devices; an assortment of spare 
parts and materials; and containers carrying fuel, oil, and 
automotive fluids. All the above equipment is designed to rescue 
a vehicle which is in dire need of assistance.

under the rubric: "Arsenal": "This `Bumblebee' Stings With 
Fire"] 
  [Text] Flamethrowers have been known as effective and at 
times irreplaceable incendiary weapons for a long time. In the 
light, portable variant, they were one or several tanks with a 
flammable mixture that are connected to a nozzle shaped like a 
gun. The pressure required to discharge the flammable mixture 
was created either using compressed gas or a powder charge. The 
shortcomings of this type of flamethrower are obvious. Their 
combat employment has been associated with a series of 
difficulties and limitations. 
  Today, we are familiarizing our readers with a new 
generation 
of flamethrower -- the capsule flamethrower. 
  The "Shmel" [Bumblebee] Rocket Infantry Flamethrower is 
designed to destroy enemy protected firing positions, disable 
lightly-armored vehicles, create fires and blind the enemy using 
the smoke of fire points. 
  "Shmel" was accepted into the inventory in 1984; series 
production began a year earlier. The flamethrower is in the 
inventory of special flamethrower subunits and also in the 
inventory of the airborne assault troops, naval infantry, and 
combined arms subunits. "Shmel" underwent serious testing in 
Afghanistan where it was utilized as a close combat weapon. By 
way of illustration, if an artillery projectile made a hole in a 
wall, "Shmel's" thermobaric munition destroyed the wall to its 
foundation. The flamethrower demonstrated high effectiveness 
while suppressing firing points in bunkers-caves, etc. 
  Today, a flamethrower is a multipurpose weapon that is 
capable of not only destroying using high temperature and 
pressure but it can also lay a smoke screen which permits the 
crew to change position. Incidentally, under average weather 
conditions the length of the impenetrable smoke screen created 
by one round is from 55 to 90 meters. 
  It is interesting that the flamethrower can be utilized even 
for peaceful purposes. They plan to study the possibility of 
employing "Shmel" to combat snow avalanches, slush, or ice jams 
near bridges. Experts think that "Shmel's" thermobaric munition 
permits it to accomplish these missions.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nikolay Astashkin and </F>
Lieutenant-Colonel Yakov Firsov, chief of the North Caucasus 
Military District press center: "Housing Problem: Number of 
Servicemen Without Apartments Not Getting Any Smaller"] 
  [Text] There is no more serious problem in the North 
Caucasus Military District than that of providing housing for 
servicemen's families. Only recently, you could count on your 
fingers the number of officers without apartments in the few 
units stationed in the district, which was jokingly called the 
health-resort district. Today the situation is different. In a 
brief period of time, units and large units from the Western 
Group of Forces, the Transcaucasus, and the Baltics have been 
withdrawn to the territory of the North Caucasus Military 
District. Troop trains continue to arrive here from the 
ex-Soviet republics and foreign countries, adding to the already 
large army of officers and warrant officers without apartments. 
Their number now exceeds 22,000. 
  Many of the officers without apartments are asking a natural 
question: Do the people "at the top"--the Ministry of Defense 
and the government--know about the housing crisis in the North 
Caucasus Military District? They not only know about it, but 
they are doing everything in their power to solve the problem. 
The district was recently visited by a group of generals and 
officers from chief administrations of the Armed Forces branches 
who are in charge of construction and quartering, led by 
Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Solomatin, chief of construction and 
quartering of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. 
  An operational conference was held right at the military 
airfield where the plane bringing the high-ranking commission 
from Moscow landed. It was attended by Colonel-General Aleksei 
Mityukhin, the district troop commander, and Viktor Anpilogov, 
first deputy administration chief and chairman of the Rostov 
Oblast government. The first community that the commission 
visited to study servicemen's housing problems was the village 
of Yegorlykskaya. The helicopter regiment stationed there was 
withdrawn from the Transcaucasus last year. And the aviators 
went from the frying pan to the fire, as they say. 
  "We were unable to bring back from the Transcaucasus 
everything we had acquired," said regiment commander 
Lieutenant-Colonel Vitaliy Makarov in a conversation with us. 
"We essentially arrived at a place where no preparations had 
been made. People are tired of living out of suitcases and tired 
of being unsettled." 
  We would like to add that most of the unit's soldiers served 
in Afghanistan, many of them more than one tour, and helped deal 
with the aftermath of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station. Many of the officers have 20 and more calendar 
years of service. 
  Needless to say, the situation in which the aviators find 
themselves cannot be called easy. And so at a construction site 
here where three apartment buildings with 147 units are being 
built, adjustments were made in the official plan in view of the 
garrison's actual housing needs. It was decided to appropriate 
additional funds to a foreign firm that is building a housing 
compound in Rostov-na-Donu so that it can construct another 400 
apartments here. And rural construction workers, with a pro rata 
contribution from the military, will help eliminate problems 
arising in connection with the construction of a boiler house 
and treatment facilities. 
  The regiment commander said that this news, which spread 
through the aviators' compound instantaneously, will give the 
airmen and their families a more optimistic outlook. And it is 
also sure to have a positive effect on the unit's combat 
readiness. 
  In connection with the well-known events in the Caucasus, 
the 
soldiers of the North Caucasus Military District are having to 
solve the problems side by side with personnel from internal and 
border troops. This significantly complicates the already 
difficult situation with respect to providing housing and other 
accommodations for the troops. But it is characteristic that the 
soldiers, regardless of the color of their stripes, are working 
to solve the problems without red tape and on a mutually 
beneficial basis. We saw this for ourselves when we visited 
Vladikavkaz. 
  This city is the focal point of the economic, political, 
ethnic, and social (including housing) problems that undoubtedly 
require solutions. In our view, the people endowed with 
authority are not only approaching these problems in an 
effective fashion but also exhibiting a can-do attitude, 
foresight, and an ability to foresee possible developments five 
to six steps ahead. 
  Consider this concrete example. On the outskirts of 
Vladikavkaz, next to a construction site where housing is being 
put up for the garrison's soldiers, is a vacant tract of land 
belonging to the Russian Defense Ministry. The command of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs internal troops 
asked the Ministry of Defense if it could station an internal 
troops brigade on the site. The commission visited the site and 
did some reconnaissance, as it were. It decided to let the 
internal troops lease the land, but not indefinitely. Who knows 
what could happen three, four, or five years from now? If the 
situation stabilizes, and let's hope it does, the internal 
troops brigade will be transferred to a new location. And if it 
is, the land and its structures built there will remain under 
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense. 
  During their stay in Vladikavkaz, the inspectors from Moscow 
could not, of course, fail to see its "pearl"--a housing 
compound built by the German firm Philipp Holtsman. 
  A frank conversation that Lt-Gen A. Solomatin and district 
troop commander Col-Gen A. Mityukhin held with the commanders of 
the garrison's units touched on many issues relating to 
providing accommodations for the troops and apartments for the 
servicemen's families and building social, cultural, and 
consumer-service facilities. It would seem that the 
commissioning of the closed compound with 1,500 apartments built 
by the foreign firm should solve the garrison's housing problem. 
Nevertheless, a waiting list of people without apartments has 
formed once again there. Needless to say, this problem has to be 
solved. And so the district troop commander, after announcing 
the construction of 12 apartment buildings, told the officers of 
another decision he had taken: About 60 families of servicemen 
who have been discharged into the reserves or who will be 
discharged this year and who have apartments in the compound 
will be allowed to make equivalent trades for housing that 
foreign firms are building in Krasnodar or Rostov-na-Donu. 
  "The North Caucasus District ranks first in the Armed Forces 
in terms of the gravity of the problems associated with 
providing accommodations for troops and apartments for 
servicemen's families," Lt-Gen A. Solomatin said in a 
conversation with us. "It's no accident that the housing problem 
in the district is being monitored by the defense minister. 
Military construction workers have been assigned the task of 
building 15,000 apartments here in 1994. We are prepared to 
accomplish that task. But everything will depend on financing, 
and so the last words rests with the government."

"Through Bilateral Contacts -- Towards a Mutually Advantageous 
Cooperation. Ukrainian Military Delegation Visits Almaty and 
Tashkent] 
  [Text] A military delegation, headed by Colonel General 
Ivan Oliynyk, deputy minister of defense for armaments of 
Ukraine and chief of armaments of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 
returned to Kiev from Central Asia. The delegation visited 
Almaty and Tashkent, where it held talks on a wide range of 
subjects with representatives of the war offices [viyskovi 
vidomstva] of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Among the topics 
discussed were the modernization of already existing equipment 
and weapons and the development of new models, scientific 
research, cooperation in the rocket and space research field, 
and the effective use of the capabilities of the 
military-industrial complexes of these sovereign countries. The 
parties expressed interest in cooperating in all these areas. In 
today's situation, this is understandable -- the shortest route 
to attaining our objective is by combining our endeavors. 
  Summarizing the outcome of the talks after the conclusion of 
the Ukrainian military delegation's visit to Kazakhstan, 
Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk underscored: 
  "These talks not only enabled us to bring our positions 
closer together but also to lay a long-term foundation for a 
series of joint measures in the field of military cooperation. 
These meetings should have been held a year ago. We have lost 
time and certain opportunities, which we now have to make up 
for." 
  Obviously, this applies not only to the talks with the 
Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan, but also to Ukraine's 
relations with Uzbekistan. After all, the armed forces of all 
three independent young states find themselves in a similar 
situation. On the one hand, this means a huge inventory of 
equipment and weapons, which very often cannot be utilized to 
their full potential due to a shortage of component and spare 
parts, and, on the other hand, a complete lack of certain kinds 
of weapons that are essential for ensuring the military security 
of a sovereign state, difficulties in settling accounts between 
states for services of a military-technical nature (the national 
monetary units have not yet been made convertible and there is a 
catastrophic shortage of hard currency in the republics' 
budgets), and a decline in the output of the defense industry, 
whose task it is to supply the army of each state with 
everything it needs to maintain a high level of combat readiness 
[boyehotovnist]. 
  Today, however, the situation is such that precisely because 
of prevailing economic conditions, the primary task facing the 
defense industry ["oboronka"] is not developing and producing 
new kinds of weapons (although this, too, must not be ignored), 
but rather modernizing and uniformizing existing inventory with 
a view to improving its tactical features. This is the sphere in 
which there are wide-ranging opportunities for cooperation on 
the part of Ukraine's defense industry enterprises with both 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan -- above all, on a bilateral basis. 
The advantages of this are quite obvious, both in political and 
economic terms. Bilateral treaties and agreements are a real 
foundation for genuinely equal, mutually advantageous interstate 
relations that are free of the so-called older or younger 
brother syndrome. It was, after all, rather strange to learn 
during the talks that at one time Russia had offered to sell 
Ukraine weapons, which, as it turns out, are being produced not 
in Russia but by Kazakhstan's defense enterprises. And, as was 
to be expected, Russia offered its services in exchange for 
rubles. Would it not make more sense for Ukraine to deal 
directly with Kazakhstan, just as Kazakhstan should not need to 
look for products of Ukrainian manufacture in Russia, but should 
come directly to a reliable partner, who is guided by principles 
of trust and mutual economic benefits? 
  It seems that after the talks this point became quite clear 
in both Almaty and Tashkent. The position of the chief of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan is quite telling 
in this respect. Despite the fact that, unlike Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan is a member of the Agreement on Collective Security 
of the CIS, Major-General Alibek Kasymov noted: 
  "A state always has its interests. And if we build the 
relations between our states on the principles of mutual 
respect, mutual trust, and mutual economic advantage proposed by 
the Ukrainian side, there will never be any misunderstandings 
between us. The further strengthening of our relations and 
anything we do to broaden and deepen them -- and I regard the 
meeting of the representatives of the defense ministries of 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine as a step in precisely this direction -- 
will only benefit the defense capabilities of both countries." 
  We should regard as quite logical the desire by the 
respective war offices to speed up the work of preparing the 
Treaty on Military Cooperation between the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine that is reflected in the concluding 
protocol. There is indeed a great deal that we can work on 
together. 
  Apart from modernizing and uniformizing armaments, an 
important role in the relations between Ukraine and Kazakhstan 
consists in cooperation directed at developing the rocket and 
space research potential of the two countries, both of which 
possess a real foundation and the necessary capabilities for 
this endeavor. Evidence of such cooperation will be Ukraine's 
Zenit carrier-rocket with a Ukrainian satellite, which will be 
launched from the Kazakh space center in Baykonur. 
  Kiev's military is also interested in obtaining access to 
the 
proving grounds located in Kazakhstan to use for their own 
needs. The effective military training of anti-aircraft and 
rocket forces is next to impossible without such access, and it 
is much more difficult to modernize certain kinds of military 
equipment. What is interesting, however, is that although de 
jure these sites clearly belong to Kazakhstan, de facto they are 
quite actively controlled by Russia. In reference to this 
matter, Col-Gen Ivan Oliynyk stated: 
  "The issue of using the military proving grounds and the 
space center located on the territory of Kazakhstan has to be 
decided on the basis of a tripartite agreement between 
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. It is unlikely that we will be 
able to attain our objective without such an agreement. I think 
that at the outset Russia may oppose the signing of such 
trilateral agreements, but we have enough arguments at our 
disposal to ultimately succeed." 
  As regards Uzbekistan, the visit of the Ukrainian military 
delegation to Tashkent will also produce fruitful and mutually 
advantageous results. For example, Ukrainian industry is in a 
position to offer the Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan a broad 
range of products and services that are needed to refurbish and 
modernize the military equipment of the national armed forces of 
Uzbekistan. There exists a real basis for joint 
scientific-military projects and for establishing a mutually 
beneficial system of training military personnel. It is not 
unlikely that in the very near future Ukrainian enterprises will 
receive orders for the manufacture of cloth for Uzbek Army 
personnel, with Uzbekistan supplying our enterprises with 
cotton... 
  Most of the plans based on the bilateral agreements, which 
are now interstate and intergovernmental in nature, are expected 
to benefit the armed forces in particular and the defense 
potential in general of all three countries -- Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan -- in the very near future.

Nagornyy Karabakh--Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev Continues 
Working Visit to Yerevan and Baku"] 
  [Text] The working visit of the Russian deputy minister of 
defense, Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev, to Yerevan and Baku 
is a logical continuation of the Moscow meeting of the defense 
ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and representatives of 
Nagornyy Karabakh. At that meeting, which was mediated by Army 
General Pavel Grachev, a protocol was signed on a total 
cease-fire in the Republic of Nagornyy Karabakh, a withdrawal of 
troops, and the creation of mutual security zones manned by 
mixed forces and a joint staff consisting of representatives of 
Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of Nagornyy 
Karabakh. 
  If Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev can secure the parties' final 
consent to implement the protocol's provisions, a joint staff of 
about 250 men will be created. Sixty-nine Russian servicemen 
will serve on that staff. They will be dispatched to the 
conflict zone only after a cease-fire and the withdrawal of 
troops and heavy equipment. 
  It should be pointed out that Col-Gen Georgiy Kondratyev 
traveled to Tskhinvali with a similar package. The mechanism for 
a cease-fire in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone proved 
successful. Will it work in Nagornyy Karabakh?

"Specter of a `Second Afghan': CIS Peacekeeping Forces in 
Tajikistan"] 
  [Text] Dushanbe-Moscow--In Tajikistan I did not know 
whether the spring offensive about which the experts had spoken 
for such a long time had actually begun. The cause of it all is 
the contrast between imposed and personal concepts. The specter 
of a "second Afghan" now loomed up in the framework of alarmed 
reports from the border, now disappeared in the presence of 
calm, impoverished Dushanbe. 
  A flare-up of activity in the spring is as natural as the 
changing of the seasons, Colonel Ivan Malevich, chief of the 
information service at the headquarters of the Joint 
Peacekeeping Forces (KMS), told me. It has always been that way. 
They have come out of Afghanistan and continue to come not in 
order to sit around in trenches. One does not have to be 
clairvoyant to anticipate an invasion as soon as the passes are 
opened and the roads dry up. Only one's imagination can predict 
what will follow.... 
<H5>  "I Do Not Capture Transgressors; I Kill Them." </H5>
  Colonel Nikolay Malofeyev, chief of the Panj border 
detachment, was more to the point in answering this question. 
Expressing dismay at the unexpected arrival of the journalist, 
he said that he was not giving interviews, that this was 
forbidden and he did not want to give any. He was more concerned 
by the shortage of personnel and the refusal of new recruits to 
go from Russia to Tajikistan in a situation in which the Tajiks 
themselves are not burning up with a desire to serve. 
  Replenishments come through the requisitions of local 
military commissariats, who frequently place young citizens of 
independent Tajikistan onto busses by force and haul them from 
the hamlets and villages to the detachment of Russian border 
troops, turning them over, as they are, without equipment or 
medical examination. There the young recruits, who sometimes do 
not know Russian, take on the appearance of a soldier in a 
situation approaching frontline conditions and acquire the 
military science of defending their fatherland. 
  From the legal standpoint it is difficult to say who they 
are 
-- mercenaries, since they are serving in a foreign army but on 
their own territory, or trainees under Russian instructors. They 
say that there is a gentlemen's agreement on this matter but not 
formalized in a contract. At the outposts they receive the same 
pay and provisions as Russian border troops, which is equal to 
ten times the minimum wage of the Tajiks. The material 
incentives have little effect upon morale, however. 
  Deserters are apprehended and returned to the bank of the 
Panj in the same way. Not all of them, to be sure. Some of them 
are still being sought. According to KMS intelligence, the 
Tajiks have trouble mastering the skills and are not 
distinguished by special valor in the conduct of combat 
operations. They account for more than half of the personnel at 
some outposts, and the Russian officers can foresee the day when 
they will be commanding Tajiks exclusively. 
  The Panj sector is considered to be under the greatest 
pressure. It experiences mortar shellings and penetration 
attempts practically every day. Tajik militants and Mojahedin 
are concentrated at the juncture of the third and fourth 
outposts in the Afghan community of Bagrikul. They have tanks 
and artillery. If they wanted to, I was told at headquarters, 
they could wipe out any fortification within a half-hour. 
  They could not get along without the support of the 201st 
Division, even though the border troops have acquired Grad 
rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers in recent 
months. The main thing is communication and constant control, 
which did not exist last summer, when the tragedy occurred at 
the 12th outpost of the neighboring Moscow detachment. The 
artillerymen keep the Afghan bank constantly in their sights. 
  Groups of up to 40 men slip through, aware that the border 
is 
guarded only during the day in the area of the outposts. In the 
morning patrols frequently find underground passages for an 
electronic signalling facility, which has not been set up over 
the entire length of the system by far. If the system has been 
activated in the night, they go out at dawn, and then only if 
there is gasoline and the vehicles are running. In such cases it 
is already too late to demonstrate fire power. One would not 
find the violators even with dogs. 
  "Do they frequently come through during the day?" I asked 
Colonel Malofeyev. "They could be refugees." 
  "No less frequently than at night. Refugees do not come 
through here, though. I do not take prisoners. I kill them." 
<H5>  It Will Obviously Not Be Necessary to Dye the Helmets </H5>
  Vehicles with light-blue tags are one of the prominent 
indications of Dushanbe. They are given the right-of-way by 
peasants, and elders bow respectfully to them. Decorative work 
with a pretension of good intentions was performed in the 201st 
Motorized Rifle Division in October of last year, when the CIS 
heads announced the creation of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces in 
Tajikistan. The commonwealth thus overcame a system of mutual 
distrust in a move toward a military alliance. More than 100 
staff members from Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghizia and 
Kazakhstan were once again arm in elbow as in former times. 
  Friendship is one thing, but they all have different zones 
of 
responsibility. The demarcation is indicated with a heavy 
felt-tipped pen on a map on the desk of Boris Pyankov, commander 
of the KMS. The allies gather there and hold council. UN 
observers from the UNMOT-1 mission sometimes look in in the hope 
of hearing the answer to a burning question addressed to them by 
Western journalists: What is Russia after in Tajikistan, peace 
for peoples or an opportunity to revive the empire? 
  The generals reply that the KMS is there in accordance with 
the UN Charter at the request of the Tajiks to ensure stability 
and arrange a dialog. And it would not be a bad thing for the 
Security Council to be given such a mandate, since the conflict 
here threatens universal peace. In this case, not just the 
licence tags but the helmets too could be painted light blue. 
  The UN members reasonably object that Russia cannot claim a 
mandate since Andrey Kozyrev himself has recognized the area as 
one of political and military interests. Furthermore, never 
before in the history of the world community have the "blue 
helmets" guarded the border of a state where an operation is 
being conducted. This is the consensus in Tajikistan. 
  Troops of the country in which they were located have never 
yet been among the UN troops engaged in operations to maintain 
peace. The peacekeeping forces must separate the sides of the 
conflict, not take them on as allies. Whom to separate, though, 
and along what line? Dushanbe alone has 4,500 underground 
opposition supporters, Kulyab Oblast has around 2000, 
Kurgan-Tyube 3,500 and Gornyy Badakhshan 7,000. This totals an 
army equaling half of all the power structures. 
  The situation is truly out of the ordinary. Peres Ballon, 
personal representative of the UN Secretary General, said in a 
talk with Boris Pyankov that he could advocate through the 
Security Council the sending of 300 military observers to 
Tajikistan. Head of state Emomali Rakhmonov seemed to agree, but 
the commander of the KMS cut him off, saying: Your spies will 
not be sitting in my headquarters. Give some status to the UN 
and gain access to operational reports. Or, as Pyankov proposes, 
we could withdraw 100 kilometers from the border and your troops 
could assume control over this zone. Anything but that, Peres 
Ballon replied. 
  In general, it is clear that there is no love lost between 
the KMS and the UN. There should be no illusions about this. 
Russia and its partners interested in the solidarity of the 
Tajik borders will obviously have to count more on the status of 
the regional coalition and on the Tajik talks on collective CIS 
security. 
  The KMS presently has 25,000 soldiers. They have at their 
disposal modern combat equipment, including aircraft and space 
communication stations. An impressive force, equal to the cost 
of peacekeeping. Russia has assumed 57 billion of the 65-billion 
ruble cost of semiannual expenses. Tajikistan is the poorest 
relative in this family. 
<H5>  Lesha Gorbatyy Gives the "Green Light" </H5>
  An Uzbek battalion of 350 men has taken up the rear area of 
the Panj border detachment, covering the southwestern part of 
Khatlon Oblast. The population there is half Uzbek, and they 
greeted the KMS personnel as their own. The bands of Ali 
Bespalov, former director of the motor vehicle directorate at 
Shartuz, are located beyond the Amu-Darya. They say that when he 
left Afghanistan he took with him a large quantity of stolen 
gold, built a home in the area of Mazari-Sharif, deals in drugs 
and has more than 200 men under arms. In December of last year 
his militants blew up a train on Tajik territory. Uzbeks in the 
KMS repelled him, and he has not appeared again. 
  One would not envy the Kyrghyz. They have one of the most 
difficult sectors in the Pamirs. The battalion of 286 men 
delayed its departure slightly and was forced to make its way 
through snow-filled passes, dragging its weapons with it. The 
starving Badakhshan people greeted the defenders well but asked 
them not to interfere with the smuggling of drugs from 
Afghanistan to the CIS. Lesha Gorbatyy, head of the Mafia in 
Iskashim Rayon generously agreed to the presence of the 
peacekeeping forces. His caravans of opium and marijuana freely 
travel the Khorog-Osh road. 
  Another problem of the Kyrghyz is that they have no money 
and 
no food. Badakhshan is in the ruble zone, and you can buy 
nothing to go with the local fish there. And the situation with 
Russian currency is tight in Tajikistan. There is not enough 
even to pay the ministers. Kyrghyz officers in the KMS receive 
wages of 2,500 rubles per month, that is true. Nothing is 
provided for the soldiers. In the future, I was told by Colonel 
Aleksandr Usatenko, Bishhkek's representative, these are 
potential bandits. For now, though, they are eating out of the 
pot of the Russian border troops. 
  There are no problems with the Kazakh battalion of the KMS, 
because there actually is no such battalion. Saken Zhasuzakov, 
Almaty's emissary at the Joint Command headquarters, told me 
that it has been formed and is supposedly in waiting at some 
railway station. They need only the order. There is no one to 
give it, though. The parliament is dissolved and a new one has 
not been elected. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who signed the agreement 
in Moscow on 24 September, lacks the authority to send the guard 
to Khorog, where, incidentally, they are not anticipating it too 
greatly, since the GBAO [Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast] 
Ismailites spare neither the Muslims nor the Kazakhs. 
  And then, my partner in the conversation told me, Russia has 
its own interests here: uranium, gold, land.... Next year, you 
know the Badakhshan people are planning a luxurious celebration 
of the 100th anniversary of their joining the Russian empire. 
The Kazakhs, however, do not have any special plans for this.... 
<H5>  Airborne Hussars as a Morale Factor </H5>
  Coincidence or not, the day Tajikistan's National Army was 
formed falls on the same day as Defenders of the Fatherland Day 
in Russia, that is, 23 February. The first anniversary was 
celebrated in Dushanbe with a military parade in Ozodi Square. 
Tajik soldiers dressed in Russian overcoats marched past the 
reviewing stand, tanks rumbled and canonneers fired salutes of 
rockets brought from Orenburg. The pirouettes of four Su-25 
fighters evoked particular excitement. The air aces were brought 
in from Kubinka near Moscow. The "airborne hussars" flew 
brilliantly, for which they were thanked by Aleksandr 
Shishlyannikov, republic minister of defense. The Dushanbe 
people had a good time. 
  Clearly it is difficult to build an army in a devastated 
state within a year. The authorities are more concerned with 
strengthening the security committee and the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs]. In numerical strength these two departments 
surpass the young Tajik Army four-fold, which, judging from 
everything, Russia will have to outfit. 
  Right now the army constitutes a fairly strange formation. 
Around half of the 6,000 men are in the separate Brigade imeni 
Fayzali Saidov, established in July 1992 at the very height of 
the bloody events as part of the Popular Front. "Bachai Fayzali" 
was a companion-in-arms of Sangak Safarov and was killed by the 
latter as punishment for pillaging. Sangak himself was done away 
with by a guard, to be sure. 
  The ethics of those days still live. The Fayzali people feed 
themselves in Kurgan-Tyube by collecting quit-rent from local 
kolkhoz members, most of whom are Uzbeks. Another settling-up 
occurred among them a month ago, during which dozens of soldiers 
and peasants died. A usual thing, unfortunately. Few take the 
killing in Tajikistan over spheres of influence and access to 
material benefits as a sign of activeness on the part of the 
opposition. 
  With less basis for relying on Minister of Internal Affairs 
Yakug Salimov, who has 20,000 men at his disposal, I was told by 
informed people, Rakhmonov sees his support precisely in the 
army and the KNB [National Security Committee]. There is a lot 
of talk about the procurator's office and investigative agencies 
not being particularly zealous in exposing crimes. Nothing is 
known at this time, for example, about who killed Lt. Dmitriy 
Kuts, a Russian border troop, near a roadside post close to 
Kurgan-Tyube. 
  More than 60 workers with the procurator's office in the 
city 
of Dushanbe have been discharged in the past three months. The 
September law on the surrender of weapons is not being observed. 
Kalashnikov semiautomatic rifles are more and more being used as 
the final say in sorting out relations with a rival or a 
claimant for a lucrative job. 
  When you speak to the Tajiks about this, they point to 
Russia, where detective subjects are sometimes far more drastic. 
Nonetheless, they put their trust in its support.

"Nuclear Weapons for Ukraine Are Like a Suitcase for a Drowning 
Man--Both Too Heavy to Hold, and a Pity to Let Go"] 
  [Text] That which we have long been waiting for has come. 
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its 
attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have 
indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of 
nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for 
compensation and security guarantees for our nation. 
  All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral 
declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to 
Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible 
time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of deliveries 
of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian nuclear power 
engineering. 
  Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear 
weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its 
territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will 
be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their 
nuclear charges. 
  Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and 
safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will 
provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and 
safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons. 
  Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration 
and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of 
President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the 
requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification 
of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by 
the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and they 
talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees and 
the granting of financial and technical assistance directed 
toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal. 
  Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as 
many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about 
politicians, then they could have even more. 
  There were meetings the day before the recent session of the 
Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and 
national security, questions of legislation and legality, 
foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study 
the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare 
findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration 
signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at 
the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each 
commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would 
be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the 
results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty. 
  According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has 
confirmed his "commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not 
possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time." The 
Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine 
to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization 
of START-1 "would open up the way for the resolution by the 
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty." 
  Another detail is connected with the fact that the 
trilateral 
declaration indicates that "Ukraine will provide for the 
destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons, deployed on its territory," even though the 
Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent 
of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear 
warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine 
to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but 
also all strategic offensive weapons along with their 
infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a 
memorandum of the U.S. embassy, "any preservation of deployed 
SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the 
START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of 
Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or 
conventional warheads," and the United States "will not agree to 
any weakening of this obligation." This categorical American 
attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of 
high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the 
SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are 
quite uncertain. 
  The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, 
financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using 
launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade 
plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers 
and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be 
discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain 
uncertain in the trilateral declaration. 
  I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in 
order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in 
the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the 
trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty 
and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 
speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of 
Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko 
stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no 
guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them, 
and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is 
a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current 
economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning 
man--too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of. 
  The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory 
of 
Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two 
paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely: 
  1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President 
and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the 
provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November 
1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States 
and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5 
of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on 
23 May 1993. 
  2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange 
letters 
on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more 
active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete 
agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme 
Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty. 
  What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean? 
  First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead. 
At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached, 
which translate or at least should translate the declarative 
substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into 
the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual 
obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for 
the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an 
agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for 
monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of 
Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the 
nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on 
guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the 
warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to 
"S" facilities and plant yards. 
  Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the 
resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in 
Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear 
or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining 
to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's 
joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the 
deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the 
voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest 
right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear 
weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia, 
however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will 
provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine 
joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell 
what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Knysh: "`Not a Sensation...'"] </F>
  [Text] IZVESTIYA of February 22 of this year published an 
article by the newspaper's military correspondent, Viktor 
Lytovkin, under the title "RVSN [Strategic Missile Forces] 
Command Disavows Responsibility for the Security of 
Nuclear-Missile Armaments in Ukraine." Referring to confidential 
sources in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the author cites 
the content of an official letter of the commander-in-chief of 
the strategic missile forces, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev, to 
Minister of Defense of Russia General of the Army Pavel Grachev. 
  The article, with reference to this letter, discussed the 
fact that "under the prevailing circumstances Russia can in no 
way have any impact on the security of the nuclear-missile 
weaponry in Ukraine and its non-sanctioned employment." This is 
connected with the decision of the commander of the 43rd Missile 
Army, Colonel-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, the commander of the 
46th Missile Division, Major-General N. Filatov, and their 
subordinates to take the oath of loyalty to the people of 
Ukraine. It also talked about the "gross violation of the 
Agreement on the Status of Strategic Forces" signed by the heads 
of the CIS and the like. 
  The facts set forth in the article were commented on at a 
briefing at the MZS [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] by Deputy 
Minister of Defense Ivan Bizhan and Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. 
  It was pointed out in particular that the Minister of 
Defense 
of Ukraine does not need to coordinate his actions with the head 
of the Russian military agency. Assertions that the command of 
the RVSN of Russia have been deprived of the possibility of 
exercising operational command and control over the troops of 
the 43rd Missile Army were categorized as a fabrication. The 
operational control remains with Russia, and Ukraine has in no 
way disrupted it and does not intend to do so, emphasized 
Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan. 
  The presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States 
signed a Declaration in Moscow on January 14. The appearance of 
this article has thus elicited, at the very least, surprise. 
  The fact was stated in particular that no one forced the 
commander of the 43rd Missile Army, Colonel-General V. Mykhtyuk, 
and the commander of the 46th Missile Division, Major-General N. 
Filatov, to take the oath of loyalty to the people of Ukraine. 
The generals, as well as the other officers, did this entirely 
voluntarily. Assertions of some gross violation of the agreement 
on the status of the strategic forces were categorized as 
untrue, because CIS strategic forces do not exist. As 
Colonel-General I. Bizhan reported, Russia unilaterally 
subordinated all of the units of the Strategic Missile Forces to 
itself in the summer of 1992. It is thus impossible to violate 
an agreement on something that does not exist. 
  The manpower levels of the units of the 43rd Army are at 85 
percent for officers and almost 100 percent for conscript 
servicemen. The high-quality officer corps thus permits the 
complete fulfillment of the tasks of combat duty and the 
maintenance of nuclear security. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
made a statement with regard to this feature that emphasized, in 
particular, the steadfast upholding by our country of all 
international agreements signed by it.

"Ukraine Must Not Step on the `Pan-Slavic Rake'"] 
  [Text] One need not be a people's deputy to notice 
that the development of the military-political situation in 
Russia is calling into question the guarantees of President 
Yeltsin with regard to the security of Ukraine, which signed the 
trilateral declaration. The example of Georgia, which has agreed 
to station Russian troops on its territory as a consequence of 
its policy of hand-wringing, testifies to the fact that the 
Russian Federation has set about in practice the realization of 
its great-power intentions, and more precisely the realization 
of a plan of peacekeeping activity that has been approved by 
neither the UN nor the CSCE. 
  There would be no grounds for alarm if we were to be guided 
by the logic of official Kiev. The more so as Ukraine, with its 
quite powerful army, is not the Baltic republics, which are 
raising an international hubbub about recent statements by 
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev with regard 
to the defense of the Russian-speaking population of the former 
USSR. The Baltic republics have not yet recovered from the shock 
of this imperialist declaration. 
  An analysis of the changes in the military-political 
situation in Russia that was performed on the eve of the New 
Year by specialists at the National Institute of Strategic 
Studies [NISD], however, does not instill optimism and is 
confirmed by recent events. 
  Ukraine has come to be in an arc of strong pressure on more 
than the common border with Russia, which is 1,270 kilometers, 
alone; add to it the uncertain situation in Crimea, and the 
activation of the 14th Army of General Lebed in the Dniester 
region, who--while in the latest twist calling his former 
comrades-in-arms from the leadership of the unrecognized 
Dniester Republic criminals--has actually confirmed suspicions 
of the transformation of this part of Moldova into an area of 
ad hoc Russian military autonomy. 
  The southern region of Russia is taking on greater 
insecurity 
for Ukraine after the agreement of Yeltsin and Shevardnadze on 
the Russian military bases on Georgian territory. Russia has up 
to now had a common border here with Ukraine through the 
Krasnodar Kray region, with access to Black Sea ports. If, as 
has been announced, Georgia agrees to protect external borders 
along with Russia, then Russia will expand considerably its 
naval presence on the Black Sea, notwithstanding the joint--and 
de facto Russian--control of the Black Sea Fleet. The 
elections in the Crimea have energized the Don Cossacks, who 
recently openly declared their claims on a portion of the 
territory of Ukraine. Analysts at the NISD do not rule out 
possible military conflicts in the future with the participation 
of the Don Cossacks, who feel themselves to be the defenders of 
the national interests of Russia. 
  The statements by Minister Grachev regarding the conflict in 
Yugoslavia, and the army that Russia is creating today, also 
arouse no less alarm. 
  The accelerated creation of Russian operational-strategic 
formations (something along the lines of the rapid-deployment 
forces), which have already received the name of the Mobile 
Forces of Russia, is attracting the particular attention of 
analysts. 
  These formations, at first glance, are being formed up only 
for use within Russia. According to the latest reports, however, 
the Mobile Forces will be able to carry out assigned tasks "in 
any theater of military operations" as early as 1995. 
  Russian Minister of Defense Grachev has indicated, not 
without satisfaction, that Russia has long dreamed of a "mighty 
combat fist," which could effectively restrain an enemy until 
the deployment of the main forces, in case of an incursion onto 
its territory. 
  Doubts regarding the exclusively domestic employment of the 
Mobile Forces, however, are confirmed not only by the military, 
but also by Russian diplomats, who are trying to show the world 
at every opportunity that Russia is still ready to perform 
"specific" tasks in zones of ethnic conflicts under the aegis of 
the CIS or as a "peacekeeper" with the authority of the UN. 
  The structure of the mobile forces testifies to their nature 
and long-term aims. Several helicopter regiments of 
ground-forces aviation, three battalions of marine infantry, PVO 
[air-defense] and communications units and fighter and bomber 
squadrons, as well as military-transport aviation, are 
subordinate to their command, for a start. All of these 
constitute a formation at the highest degree of readiness--the 
immediate-response forces. Sixty percent of the composition of 
the Mobile Forces is airborne-assault units, and the other forty 
is motorized-rifle and special forces, surface-to-air missile 
and helicopter units, a mobile communications center and space 
communications gear, fighter, bomber and military-transport 
aviation units, battalions of marine infantry and 
airborne-assault battalions. 
  As we see, at a time when the Ukrainian people's deputies 
consider nuclear weapons, which cannot be physically used 
against any aggressor, to be a guarantee of the security of 
Ukraine, Russia is purposefully, as any normal nation should, 
and actively rebuilding its armed forces in parallel with the 
disarmament of Ukraine. Today, therefore, when a knot of 
contradictions and mutual offenses has accumulated between 
Russia and Ukraine, the activation of military organizational 
development in Russia is forcing Ukraine to define a 
qualitatively new conceptual framework in relations with its 
northern neighbor. A wager on the stability of Yeltsin could 
lead to the fact that Ukraine, as in the times of Khmelnytskyy, 
could once again step on the "pan-Slavic rake."

<F P=106> [Article by Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the </F>
Army Vitaliy Radetskyy: "Start of the Year: Building, Educating, 
Peacekeeping"] 
  [Text] The third year in the building of the armed forces 
of Ukraine has begun, encompassing questions of the composition 
and structure of the troops (forces), their training for 
military action, their technical equipping, manpower 
acquisition, mobilization and strategic deployment, the training 
of reserves, the performance of active duty and other issues. 
  There is every reason to assert today that we have chosen 
the 
directions of military development correctly. The basic laws on 
military issues have already been adopted, the Military Doctrine 
has been approved, and the conceptual development of two 
interconnected state programs is underway--the building and 
development of the armed forces, and the development of weaponry 
and military hardware. The efforts of the leadership personnel 
of the armed forces of Ukraine and the work of our military 
intellectuals facing the knot of problematical tasks pertaining 
to military organizational development are directed namely at 
that. 
  The scientific development of the force composition of the 
armed forces within the limits of the size stipulated for us, 
and the organizational structure of command and control 
elements, large formations and units with the aim of the most 
efficient utilization of the weapons systems and military 
hardware, firepower and striking power of the troops (forces) 
has gained particular urgency. 
  Questions of equipping the armed forces of Ukraine with 
advanced weapons systems and military hardware and reducing the 
variety of logistical mat&eacute;riel have also not escaped the 
attention of military scholars and specialists. Keeping in mind 
the systematic restructuring of the economy of Ukraine that is 
underway, they are not failing to pay attention to questions of 
the structural convergence of the military-industrial complex 
and the armed forces. 
  Paramount attention is being devoted therein to the use of 
our world-class achievements in the realm of missile and space 
technology, which will make it possible in the future not only 
to equip the armed forces of Ukraine with all types of modern 
missile hardware, but also for our state to take part in 
international space programs in the interests of the national 
economy and science. We can thus state with confidence that 
Ukraine can and will be a missile and space power. 
  The search for solutions continues with regard to the 
problems of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  We feel that the first and main task that must be resolved 
pertaining to this problem, and on which the success of all 
further work depends, is a complete verification of all of the 
property and military hardware of the Black Sea Fleet on hand, 
both on water and on land, as well as the assurance of 
regulation law and order in Sevastopol and the Crimea as a 
whole. The building of our own fleet for Ukraine is continuing 
at the same time. The small ASW ship Lutsk, whose crew is today 
continuing their teamwork, has completed sea trials and has been 
commissioned in the force composition of the Navy of Ukraine. 
  Tasks pertaining to raising the combat readiness of the 
elements for technical and rear support of the troops (forces), 
at the same time, have not lost their significance as well. A 
constant search is underway for ways to increase the 
maneuverability and survivability of support and servicing 
units. A search is underway for sources of extrabudgetary 
financing for the measures being carried out in the armed forces. 
  One problem in military organizational development was 
bringing the system of training and indoctrination of the 
military cadres into conformity with the considerations of the 
requirements of troop practices, the views of the nature and 
methods of waging modern possible wars, operations and battles. 
  The Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense met in 
order to solve this important problem, and reviewed problems and 
issues of military education and the rectification of errors. 
Concrete measures were instituted in accordance with their 
decisions with regard to improving the qualitative composition 
of the leadership elements of field education and the 
performance of paramount measures aimed at building an efficient 
system of military education and indoctrination, as well as the 
organized holding of graduating exams and the distribution of 
young officers among units and subunits. 
  Work was continued to refine future improvements in the Army 
and Navy, the draft and the performance of military service by 
those obligated to serve. 
  Attention has not diminished in this regard toward the 
activity of the military commissariats, through which all of the 
personnel of the armed forces pass twice--the first time during 
their conscription into active military service, and the second 
when they are discharged into the reserves. The principal 
interaction of the Army and the civilian population of Ukraine 
and the reservists takes place through the military 
commissariats. The reputation of the armed forces is thus formed 
in the citizenry based on how the military commissariats operate 
today. 
  A council was held at the Ministry of Defense with the 
command personnel of the military commissariats, with the aim of 
further strengthening the local elements of military 
administration as an important echelon in military 
organizational development; the council discussed concrete ways 
of raising the quality of the conscription of the youth and 
improving mobilization readiness and the official activities of 
the military commissariats at all levels. 
  The commanders and elements of educational and 
socio-psychological work and the chiefs at all levels have been 
conducting a search for ways of improving the 
socio-psychological climate among the troops, and for more 
effective forms for the indoctrination of the personnel with a 
regard for historical and national traditions in the interests 
of strengthening military discipline and order. 
  Our planned work among the troops and measures to monitor it 
have shown, at the same time, that such deficiencies as 
excessive formalism in the organization of combat raining, 
education and indoctrination of the personnel, an inability to 
organize service and order under the new conditions and to know 
the most important things in work continue to exist in the units 
and subunits. 
  The Military Council of the Air Forces has thus still not 
defined its place and role in preserving the battleworthiness of 
aviation and improving morale and the psychological conditions 
of the servicemen, and has gotten tied up in the resolution of 
secondary tasks, which has affected the activity and overall 
status of the military collectives. 
  A certain sluggishness and inconsistency in the performance 
of work to strengthen military discipline has been typical in 
general of a certain quantity of larger formations and units; 
that has kept them from achieving any noticeable improvement, 
reducing the number of instances of non-regulation relations or 
absences without leave and eradicating other negative phenomena. 
The quantity of servicemen who have deserted their units also 
remains too high. 
  We have taken concrete steps, aside from measures on a 
disciplinary plane, to improve the situation in the ranks by 
improving the food and everyday living conditions for all 
categories of servicemen and making a transition to a new style 
of dress, along with more active work with regard to improving 
standard legal documents and the organization of interaction 
with the bodies of internal affairs, as well as the entry into 
force of the Temporary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
The state of military discipline and provision of good living 
conditions in subordinate units and subunits is considered to be 
one of the principal indicators of the professional ability of 
commanders and superior officers at all levels. 
  The start of the new training year in the armed forces of 
Ukraine was devoted by and large to the practical rehearsal of 
questions of bringing the troops and forces to combat readiness, 
studying areas of combat application and routes of access to 
them, and improving engineer measures and the combat interaction 
of subunits. The Ministry of Defense also conducted several 
important measures over that brief period. 
  The problem of training individuals for higher 
military-political leadership to fulfill their constitutional 
obligations under conditions of crisis and conflict situations 
has existed for nations at all times. This problem has gained 
particular urgency during the period of building our young state. 
  Its resolution is complicated by the necessity of training 
higher personnel in the organizational unity and interaction of 
all power structures that constitute the military organization 
of the state. 
  Joint strategic staff exercises were conducted in the 
interests of solving this problem, new to us, from January 24 
through 28 of this year under the leadership of the President of 
Ukraine and Supreme Commander-in-Chief, with the involvement of 
the commanders of the Border Troops, National Guard, National 
Security Service, Minister of Internal Affairs and chief of 
staff of Civil Defense of Ukraine with the corresponding command 
and control elements. The fact that the improvement of knowledge 
and skills of the higher military-political leaders endowed with 
the functions of ensuring external and internal security was 
accomplished for the first time against a uniform strategic 
background and on a uniform plane and intent was a principal 
feature of the exercises. 
  The results of the training confirmed the necessity of 
utilizing forms of strategic training, in the process of which 
questions of the joint resolution or elimination of crisis and 
conflict situations that affect the vital activity of the state 
and the administration of its power structures and regions are 
practiced. The organization of such strategic exercises will 
require additional scientific refinement in this regard in the 
interests of further improvements in them, which will provide an 
opportunity of devising the corresponding nationwide official 
documents. 
  The great amount of training work that was performed by the 
Ministry of Defense, along with the other ministries and 
agencies, with regard to resolving problems connected with the 
deployment of the elements of the former strategic nuclear 
forces of the Union in Ukraine, as is well known, have already 
gained practical realization. The Supreme Soviet approved on 
February 3 the trilateral declaration of the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia on the removal from our 
territory of all nuclear weapons. The declaration contains 
provisions for Ukraine pertaining to guarantees of the military 
security of Ukraine on the part of the United States, Russia and 
Great Britain, which voluntarily joined the declaration as a 
nuclear power and additional guarantor of the security of our 
state. The declaration also guarantees compensation for Ukraine 
for the value of the highly enriched uranium that is contained 
in the nuclear warheads that will be removed from Ukraine to 
Russia for dismantling. 
  The political gain that was won therein has allowed us to 
make international activity, including in the military spheres, 
more active. 
  Relations are being expanded, on a bilateral basis, with 
regard to military-technical collaboration among the military 
agencies of the CIS nations. Working meetings have been held 
over this brief period by delegations of Ukraine with 
delegations from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
  A military delegation headed by the Minister of Defense of 
Ukraine, over the brief period of February 8-9, made a friendly 
official visit to the Hungarian Republic, where they were 
received by prominent state and military figures and held 
negotiations on the further development of fraternal relations 
and mutually advantageous military-technical collaboration on a 
broad circle of issues. 
  We will now have two battalions in Yugoslavia, each of which 
will have three special companies, one combat-engineer company 
and rear and medical support companies, owing to the fact that 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine adopted a resolution on 19 
November 1993 to increase the size of the Ukrainian contingent 
in the peacekeeping forces there to 1,220 people. This decision 
was made by request of the UN Security Council. 
  Work was performed over January-February of this year 
pertaining to manpower acquisition for the first battalion, 
training of the rotation personnel and its dispatch by aircraft 
and railroad. 
  We expect that our soldiers will fulfill their peacekeeping 
duties in a worthy manner. 
  The crisis situation in the economy, and the lack of a 
military-industrial complex in the country that could 
structurally meet the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine for 
weaponry and military hardware, continue to have a negative 
impact on the logistical status of the troops, and are reflected 
in the pace of their development. The personnel of the armed 
forces are utilizing all available opportunities to preserve the 
battleworthiness of units and formations of the command and 
control elements under the difficult economic conditions. 
  I would like to emphasize overall that the difficulty of the 
problems that have arisen cannot diminish our persistence in the 
organizational development of the armed forces of Ukraine. The 
fact that the army needs help in other areas in these difficult 
times, and first of all on questions that pertain to the youth 
and, in particular, instilling in them a feeling of national 
pride and readiness to serve in the ranks of the armed forces of 
their Fatherland, also cannot be concealed. 
  The new state has to have its own army. This is undoubtedly 
a 
state matter, a matter for all the people. I thus appeal not 
only to the leaders of state structures, but also to civil 
society, to the mothers and fathers of the pre-conscription 
youth. We must all together with the army, after all, prepare 
from among our youth the reliable defenders of the independence 
of Ukraine, prepare them with full responsibility. The results 
will then be substantial, and the benefits from them will be 
felt.

<F P=106> [Article by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Military Commentator </F>
Aleksandr Zhilin, under the rubric: "Army": "A Yellow Trident on 
Rusty Armor"] 
  [Text] The hope that the CIS States would be able to 
preserve the common armed forces died at that moment when 
Ukraine announced its intention to build its own army. "Having 
nationalized" the troops located on its territory, Kiev 
destroyed the once unified defense complex but it didn't manage 
to properly utilize what it obtained as an inheritance. Today, 
the Ukrainian National Army (UNA) is that same mirage that it 
was two years ago. 
  Ukraine always played a key role in the Union's defense 
system. The Soviet General Staff proceeded from the concept that 
the primary threat to the country's security emanates from the 
West and therefore Moscow did not begrudge the resources to 
strengthen the western borders. The newest military equipment 
and the most effective weapons were first and foremost supplied 
to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and also to the 
Carpathian and Odessa military districts. Ukrainian 
military-industrial complex enterprises, which composed 
30% of 
the USSR's defense potential, received enormous investments from 
the center. 
  Ukraine obtained a truly luxurious inheritance from the 
Soviet Armed Forces. Besides 176 RS-18 (SS-19) and RS-22 (SS-24) 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, 1,280 warheads and more 
than 40 Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers with 600 air-based 
cruise missiles, Ukraine "privatized" second strategic echelon 
regiments and divisions -- the most combat capable military 
units. This is 20 motorized-rifle and tank divisions, coastal 
defense forces, several airborne assault formations, three 
high-powered artillery divisions, and hundreds of special 
purpose units and subunits. Add to that four air armies armed 
with 230 fighter aviation aircraft and 620 ground attack 
aircraft. And, furthermore, Ukraine obtained 330 strike 
helicopters; units and formations of an independent PVO [air 
defense] army; missile attack warning system, intelligence, and 
communications facilities and so on. Taking into account the 
personnel of all military structures, the strength of the units 
and formations totaled approximately 700,000 men. 
  This enormous quantity of troops had a powerful technical 
base at that time. Its inventory consisted of new T-64 and T-72 
tanks; BMP-1, BMP-2, BTR-70, BTR-80, and BRM-1K armored 
vehicles; 2A65, 2S19, BM-21, and 9P140 -- artillery and missile 
systems; "Tochka" tactical missile systems; S-200 and S-300 air 
defense missile systems; Mi-6, Mi-8, Mi-9 and Mi-24 helicopters; 
and, MiG-25, MiG-29, Su-24, Su-25 and Su-27 aircraft. 
  However, in the final analysis this mighty military 
potential 
did a disservice to Ukraine, having hung heavy weights on its 
economy and budget. 
  According to the experts, when it began creating its own 
army, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense initially permitted 
several elementary errors. First of all, it did not assess the 
actual expenditures associated with the maintenance and storage 
of weapons. Second, it did not resolve a fundamental issue: What 
is reasonable sufficiency of military equipment and personnel, 
taking into account the capabilities of the economy and the 
state budget. Third, it did not become involved with the 
immediate sale of excess equipment to the national economy and 
excess weapons and military vehicles -- abroad. As a result, 
today all of the military equipment is in such a deplorable 
state that it can be sold only for scrap. 
<H6>  Reform According to Morozov </H6>
  In 1992, Ukrainian Minister of Defense General Morozov 
announced that he was beginning a four-stage military reform. 
The mechanisms for command and control of the troops would be 
established in the first stage (1992-1993), a strategic plan for 
the employment of the armed forces would be developed in the 
second stage (1993-1994) and, a mobilized deployment and reserve 
training system would be developed in the third (1995). By that 
time, they assumed the strength of the Ukrainian National Army 
would be reduced to 400,000-450,000 servicemen and to 
200,000-250,000 servicemen by the year 2000 (the fourth stage). 
  At that time, it was announced that the Ukrainian armed 
forces would consist of three types of troops -- ground troops, 
the air force and the navy. They proposed creating two 
operational commands -- Western and Southern -- based upon the 
military districts. 
  In Morozov's words, 1993 was to have become the key year, 
during the course of which they would have to "resolve the 
primary group of issues associated with the qualitative 
transformations of the army". Alas, this year turned out to be 
"key" only for the minister of defense who was forced into 
retirement. 
  General Vitaliy Radetskiy, who replaced Morozov, openly 
announced at an 18 January press conference that "the armed 
forces still do not have a unified command and control system 
and mastery of military terminology is an important problem". In 
other words, the new minister of defense admitted that he will 
have to begin military reform practically from the beginning. 
  According to observers, the fact that the former minister of 
defense was too dependent on the political situation was the 
primary reason for the failure of "reform according to Morozov". 
This may have been explained in part by the fact that the 
"Russian general" at the head of the military department was 
immediately perceived by certain circles as a potential "traitor 
of Ukrainian national interests". Therefore, from the first day 
in the minister's post, Morozov was compelled to be less 
involved with the organizational development of the army and 
more involved with maneuvering among the president, parliament, 
the government, nationalists, communists, and Democrats... 
  The aspiration to immediately please all political forces 
did 
not leave any chances to achieve any definite concept of 
military reform. And essentially all innovations were reduced to 
the fact that the commanders began to appoint those who had 
"Ukrainian" written on their military identity cards and 
knowledge of the Ukrainian language became the main criterion of 
professional training. 
  "A regimental commander told us frankly: Henceforth the main 
thing for us is not to fly well but to issue commands and to 
conduct radio exchanges in the Ukrainian language", says 
Military Pilot Aleksandr Serdyuk. "As they say, we got the 
message and began to master Ukrainian. And no one really knows 
military terms, other terms simply do not exist in the Ukrainian 
language, and therefore we communicate primarily in obscene 
international slang..." 
  "The most horrible thing is that from the beginning the 
Ukrainian Army began to be built on the most loathsome Soviet 
principles," says former Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Central 
Staff Associate Colonel Vasiliy Osipenko. "Total window 
dressing, eye wash, corruption and absolute indifference to the 
actual state of combat readiness of units and subunits. The 
chain reaction of deception began with Morozov's optimistic 
reports to the president in which it was argued that the 
difficulties in the army were temporary." 
  Characterizing the state of the army, one highly-placed 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense bureaucrat pointed out that the 
level of combat readiness had been reduced by more than 
70%. In 
his words, pilots who do not at all know how to fly as a pilot 
in command are being graduated from military flying schools. 
"Taking into account the extremely unfavorable situation with 
nuclear weapons storage and the critical social tension in the 
troops, the Ukrainian armed forces are dangerous first and 
foremost for their own country."

<H6>  An Army of Turncoats? </H6>
  Having an inadequate number of its own skilled command 
cadres, Ukraine at one time attempted to entice them from the 
CIS countries. Already in 1991, the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers adopted a decree on increasing staff salaries by a 
factor of 2.5 and rank salaries by a factor of 1.5. At that 
time, officer salaries in Ukraine significantly exceeded the 
salaries of their colleagues in the near abroad. The widely 
advertised law "On Pension Support of Servicemen and Command and 
Rank and File Individuals of the Internal Affairs Organs" played 
its role. Officers, army and naval warrant officers, and 
extended service military personnel who agreed to take the 
Ukrainian oath were promised: For 20 years service, a pension -- 
50 percent of the salary and, those released due to illness -- 
55 percent plus three percent of that sum for each year of 
service over 20 years. 
  Currently, all of these benefits have worked out so that the 
salary of the Ukrainian minister of defense in coupons is 
equivalent to the salary of a Russian major in rubles. But at 
that time many officers were bought by the generous promises and 
rushed to be transferred to serve in Ukraine. 
  Today, the situation has drastically changed; of ten 
military 
academy students, only one agrees to go serve in the Ukrainian 
National Army. But then again, the reverse process is gaining 
momentum before our very eyes. 
  "Recently, officers are running from Ukraine to Russia 
nearly 
in entire subunits," asserts Reserve Colonel of Justice Sergey 
Borisenko. "Previously, it was as if they sought a plausible 
pretext to change their duty location. Now they drive to Moscow 
without notice and knock on every door of the Russian Ministry 
of Defense." 
  This is the sad result of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense 
leaders' reliance on officer-turncoats. This is entirely 
legitimate since a serviceman who has once betrayed the oath for 
the sake of a higher salary is entirely capable of betraying it 
ten more times for that same reason. 
  Noting the decline of morale and the moral potential of the 
Ukrainian Army, psychologists think that the enormous gap 
between the promised material benefits and the beggarly (in real 
life) state is the reason for that. The situation is worsened by 
the fact that the officers and generals who took the Ukrainian 
oath in exchange for the promised material welfare (and they are 
63% of the Ukrainian National Army) are least of all 
concerned 
about Ukraine's national interests or the ideology of national 
revival. They were prepared to serve here for good money. But 
there is no money and there is no obligation. Those are the 
rules of the game that the Ukrainian authorities themselves set. 
<H6>  The Half-Life </H6>
  The fact that the military equipment that the Ukrainian 
National Army obtained is rusting and being destroyed is not so 
terrible. The moral "corrosion" of the personnel is far more 
terrible. 
  "If I lived on the salary that I earn in the army, I would 
have long ago lived by begging," says Military Pilot Senior 
Lieutenant Yaroslav Fedoseyev. "All the more so that they delay 
payment of the paltry sum of this salary to us for 2-3 months. 
Therefore, I run a business in my off-duty time (and we "serve" 
from 0900 to 1300 -- there's nothing to fly in). Previously, my 
wife and I rushed to Poland to buy things. Today, I am involved 
in smuggling gasoline from Russia." 
  And here is the revelation of Junior Aircraft Technician 
Senior Lieutenant A.R.: "The most widespread business among 
junior officers is narcotics trafficking. All officer 
dormitories are overflowing with "grass". Commanders prefer to 
sell materiel, fuel, and construction materials. Everything that 
enjoys the slightest demand is being sold. Our regimental 
commander contrived to purchase two automobiles and to build 
three garages during the three summer months." 
  The pilots of an air base in the city of Artsiz told us 
about 
a noteworthy incident. In the middle of the night, they reported 
to the unit duty officer that the entire guard detail was drunk. 
While the officer went up to the guard room on foot, the drunken 
soldiers grabbed assault rifles and cartridges and left in a 
motor vehicle to go see some girls. The duty officer and several 
other officers rushed off in pursuit in their Zhigulis (there 
were no other serviceable vehicles in the regiment). They caught 
up with the soldiers. And... the situation drastically changed. 
Now the already armed soldiers began to pursue the officers. 
Rushing back to the garrison, the duty officer and his 
assistants barricaded themselves in the duty office. The 
soldiers attempted to take the building by storm but they 
couldn't pull it off because of their drunken state. Then they 
shot up the Zhigulis. This emergency situation ended with the 
punishment of the duty officer for... having driven to work in 
his own vehicle. 
  Of course, there are enough similar stories in the Russian 
Army. The shortage of soldiers is worsening the situation both 
in Russia and in Ukraine. In a recent interview in SHCHIT I MECH 
newspaper, Military Procurator Major-General of Justice Vasiliy 
Melnichuk said: "No more than 12 out of every 100 young men are 
serving in Ukraine... The number of evasions of service in the 
army is 35% of all military crimes in the western region 
of the 
republic." 
  Military analysts think that only urgent military reform can 
stop the decline of the Ukrainian Army that has not yet been 
born. But it must take into account not only the aspiration for 
independence but also the state of the economy. Otherwise, the 
question will arise already tomorrow, who will die earlier: The 
army or the economy?

<F P=106> [Article by Major Vladimir Knysh, NARODNA ARMIYA </F>
correspondent: "`Unknown Troops'--This Is the Way Many Still See 
Formations of Civil Defense of Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Many recall that the civil defense existed in the 
former Union. They will probably tell you how they fled from 
lectures on protection from a "sudden nuclear, chemical, or 
bacteriological attack by the probably enemy." The attitude 
toward civil defense, formed on the basis of "brilliant" 
training films and busy practical classes was, and in some 
places still is, one-sided. Incidentally, there would be nothing 
surprising in this if they still practiced that extremely 
simplistic, even dilettantish approach to the perception of 
everything that was included in the concept of "civil defense." 
  Today, possibly, such a phrase might seem somewhat 
pretentious to some. Others might even doubt the very fact of 
the existence of civil defense in Ukraine. Both types should 
recall that 3 February 1993 marked the adoption of the Law "On 
Civil Defense of Ukraine," which says that "citizens of Ukraine 
have the right to protection of their life and health from the 
consequences of accidents, catastrophes, large fires, and 
natural disasters and to demand of the Government of Ukraine and 
other organs of state executive power and the administrations of 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations, regardless of 
their forms of ownership and management, a guarantee that it 
will be enforced. 
  "The state, as the guarantor of this right, creates a civil 
defense system whose objective is to protect the population from 
dangerous consequences of accidents and catastrophes of a 
technogenic, ecological, natural, and military nature." 
  During Cold War times some of the most zealous military 
analysts of the West tried to include USSR civil defense forces 
with the full-fledged infantry troops. They used this as an 
argument for letting the appetites of their military department 
grow. Still, it was impossible not to advertise the semantic 
difference between the words "defense" and "protection" 
(contributing to defense, which, undoubtedly, expresses more 
precisely the character of the tasks performed by civil defense). 
  According to the law in our country, "civil defense forces 
are troops and specialized and nonspecialized formations. Civil 
defense troops are under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Ukraine. Their direct leadership is provided by the 
chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine." This is Lieutenant 
General Viktor Grechaninov. 
  The civil defense of Ukraine and its troops are still very 
young--they are not even a year old. Nonetheless their "combat 
path" began considerably before the official date of the 
adoption of the law. The stages of this path were Chernobyl and 
work in the "off-limits zone," the rendering of aid to the 
population of western rayons of Ukraine which ended up in the 
flooded zone, participation in putting out the forest fires in 
the Crimea where, largely thanks to the efficient interaction 
between civil defense forces and local formations organized by 
the State Commission on Emergencies (it included the first 
deputy chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine, Major General 
Nikolay Kapustyan), areas where fire broke out were localized 
and considerable areas of forest were saved. There was work for 
radioactive decontamination of areas in the city of Korostena 
and constant excursions for mine clearing. Finally, the last 
example: Work in the flooded areas of Transcarpathia. All this 
was done by civil defense forces... 
  But nonetheless, its formations are still "unknown forces" 
to 
many of us. 
  A bright burst and the thunder of an explosion--an accident 
at a chemical enterprise. It is located on the edge of the city, 
which is living its ordinary life and not suspecting that the 
countdown to a possible tragedy had already begun. 
  Major Vladimir Mukhanov's first emergency-rescue battalion 
with its attached subdivisions (a fire-fighting company, an 
excavator company, and a chemical protection company) arrived in 
the region of the accident. The task was to reconnoiter the 
site, to rescue and evacuate the wounded, and to localize 
individual outbreaks of fire. 
  Since the source of the explosions was a container of 
prussic 
acid, the military servicemen of Captain Grigoriy Khablov's 
rescue company, the firemen of Captain Grigoriy Piven's 
fire-fighting company, and the military servicemen of other 
specialties work with individual means of protection. 
  Evacuation of the wounded was organized immediately. The 
firemen of Sergeant Nikolay Prisyazhnyuk's compression section, 
Privates A. Kramaranko and I. Pogrebnyak and Junior Sergeant E. 
Gavich, had to put out the fires and remove obstructions in 
order literally to beat their way through to the victims. 
  According to information from the enterprise's chief 
engineer, a work shift consisting of three people was in one of 
the shops. The entrance was blocked. Emergency evacuation was 
necessary. And the jack hammers of the compressor team were 
again put to work. Within 20 minutes they had drilled through a 
concrete structure about 40 centimeters wide and the workers 
were released from their captivity. 
  The troops operate smoothly and efficiently. Excavators and 
other specialized equipment are used. The rescue workers 
carefully inspect the premises of the shops and conduct searches 
for workers who may have fallen under the rubble. The victims 
are given first aid and quickly evacuated out of the danger 
zone... 
  This time it was a demonstration class in the organization 
and actions of emergency-rescue battalions at the facilities, 
which was conducted at the final training sessions for 
commanders of civil defense units. But if, God forbid, all this 
had really happened, it would be they--the men of the "unknown 
forces"--who would be first to enter into hand-to-hand combat 
with danger. 
  As for the officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men of 
the first emergency-rescue battalion, they have to their 
personal credit participation in the search and rescue work 
after last year's well-known disaster with the Ruslan aircraft. 
For three months this year the troops worked to decontaminate 
areas around the city of Korosten. When there was an accident 
with the Kiev purification installations they conducted the 
decontamination--they removed the coastal earth to a depth of 40 
centimeters, loaded it into containers, and transported it to 
the place designated for it. They worked quickly, knowing what 
an important task had been assigned to them. Is there any need 
to mention that they performed the hardest ecological work on 
the Lybed River, on an area of three or four kilometers? 
  Overall, in Kiev alone there are 47 potentially dangerous 
facilities that have been "assigned" to civil defense forces. 
They are prepared at any time of the day, under any weather 
conditions, to come to our aid and spare us from disaster. 
  And problems--civil defense forces have them too. They have 
inadequate means of small-scale mechanization and sometimes a 
very serious shortage. They do not even have enough rack jacks. 
Even though in Donetsk there is an enterprise which produces 
very good pneumatic equipment--convenient, practical, and small, 
which could lift concrete slabs weighing up to three tonnes. 
This is something that is needed. But, alas, they are expensive 
and there is no money. Just as is the acquisition of new 
instruments for chemical reconnaissance. So they use what they 
have, or what they have so far. Some are also manufacturing 
their own. And they do not complain about life. Even though 
theirs is not very sweet. Most of the officers of civil defense 
units do not have housing either; they take care of their 
families as well as their financial capabilities will allow. 
Here in the first emergency-rescue battalion, half of the 14 
officers and warrant officers do not have apartments. 
  It would seem that formations directly under the Cabinet of 
Ministers should not have to go begging. Alas, local authorities 
at all levels are rather stingy in dealing with their civil 
defense. 
  But if there is ever any natural disaster or large 
emergency--the State Committee on Emergency Situations convenes, 
possibly headed by a deputy prime minister (the main person in 
charge of civil defense) right in the situation room (the 
President of the United States in the White House is not the 
only one to have such a thing, there is also one in the 
headquarters of the civil defense of Ukraine), in order to make 
important and crucial decisions. And there they receive 
exhaustive clear information about emergency situations. 
Incidentally, this room is an object of legitimate pride. And 
especially for Grigoriy Dovbysh--the chief of the department for 
the automated control system of the staff of the civil defense 
of Ukraine. It is equipped with computers, and their memory 
contains, for example, a program of the five main 
prognosticatory-modeling systems for emergency situations. They 
include Proton (nuclear power plant accident), Zaryad (for 
chemical facilities), Vulkan (earthquakes and their 
consequences), Kaskad (catastrophic floods), and Buran (nuclear 
strikes). All these names were given not to frighten people but 
as a confirmation of how serious and crucial is the work 
entrusted to civil defense. They are the first to be sent to the 
most dangerous places--to clean up after accidents, 
catastrophes, and natural disasters. And they are frequently 
forgotten when the time comes to solve their problems--even the 
most immediate ones.

<F P=106> [Interview under the rubric "Crucial Interview" with </F>
Lieutenant General Viktor Grechaninov, chief of staff of civil 
defense of Ukraine, by Colonel Valentin Dmitriyev, NARODNA 
ARMIYA correspondent; place and date not given: "Our Specialists 
Are Always Ready!"] 
  [Text] [Dmitriyev] Viktor Fedorovich, a year ago, on 3 
February, the Law of Ukraine "On Civil Defense of Ukraine" was 
adopted. This day has now become a holiday for a large number of 
people who see the entire meaning of their work in the 
protection of the life and health of people, preventing 
emergencies and catastrophes, and cleaning up after them. What 
are their daily tasks like? 
  [Grechaninov] According to that law, for a year we have been 
living, working, and reforming the civil defense system, 
fulfilling the requirements and tasks contained in that document 
for creating a system for defending the life and health of 
people in Ukraine. During that time we have done a great deal of 
work for reorganizing the structure of the staff itself, we have 
published statutes on the civil defense staff of Ukraine and on 
regional civil defense staffs, and the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine is now considering a draft we submitted of the Statute 
on Civil Defense and a number of other documents that would make 
it possible to create the legal base necessary for successful 
performance of the tasks set for civil defense. And here they 
are. The main one is to prevent emergencies, and namely 
accidents and catastrophes of a technical nature. And if they 
occur anyway--to clean up after them skillfully and quickly, to 
render aid to the victims, to provide life support systems, etc. 
From this follows an entire complex of tasks, beginning with 
prompt notification and ending with aid to the suffering 
population after the cleanup. This is a long list of jobs which 
require special forces and means. Therefore, the civil defense 
forces consist of civil defense troops of specialized formations 
and nonmilitarized formations. 
  There does not seem to be any need to explain in detail just 
what civil defense troops are. But their specialized formations 
are worth discussing. They include highly qualified 
specialists--rescue workers who provide guaranteed service for 
various dangerous enterprises. We in Ukraine have 1,693 of these 
enterprises in the chemical area alone. The country has too many 
sources of danger: Among them are nuclear power plants and water 
reservoirs, which in the right circumstances could be the cause 
of great catastrophes. There are also possible earthquakes. Or, 
for example, the danger of secondary consequences -- a break in 
the dam of the sedimentation pond at a chemical enterprise, etc. 
  [Dmitriyev] Do you have a certain kind of specialists or is 
it possible to teach just any soldier to do the job? 
  [Grechaninov] It is difficult to train the same soldier 
psychologically for action in extreme situations when, for 
example, there has been an earthquake or a landslide and it is 
necessary to look through the heaps of rubble and rescue people, 
to drag the victims out, etc. And it cannot be ruled out that it 
will be necessary to deal with the dead, the wounded... This is 
far from easy. Therefore we have special training aimed at 
developing in the individual the necessary qualities and 
psychological stability in the most difficult of situations. 
  We have a very broad scope of training. The main thing is 
that we must have specialists who are capable of working while 
wearing the necessary protective clothing, depending on the 
nature of the production and the accident. They include people 
capable of working under water, of jumping from the air in a 
disaster zone; they include specialists capable of evaluating a 
situation on the spot, making a decision, and correctly carrying 
out what they have decided, which is very important. Because if 
a mistake is made in emergency rescue work, the consequences can 
sometimes be irreparable; for example, if you disturb a pile of 
rubble and do not manage to save the people. A high level of 
professionalism is achieved through constant training. And we 
are now placing our hopes in the idea of having our people work 
under contract, that is, for several years. Because it is very 
difficult to train a skilled specialist in a year and a half: 
His training is long and varied. 
  Further. We have specialized subdivisions--like the Spetsat 
[expansion not indicated], the Poltava detachment for cleanup 
after accidents at petroleum deposits, the Dneprodzerzhinsk and 
Zaporozhye chemical detachments, and others. These people under 
today's conditions (let me note that they are excellent 
specialists) must have good wages and proper social protection. 
Otherwise they will go to commercial structures. And there are 
truly dedicated people among them... This is one of today's 
problems. 
  [Dmitriyev] But your people need not only a high level of 
mastery but, frequently, also courage, heroism... 
  [Grechaninov] Our people never think about whether it is 
heroism or not. Suffice it to recall that at the accident at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant the first readings of the 
radiation around the destroyed reactor were taken by our 
officers, particularly Aleksandr Tomlenov. It was a civil 
defense specialist who took the first helicopter flight to take 
readings over the reactor. 
  We have a lot of problems, for example, with the little 
"presents" left on the land after a war. Most frequently they 
are large-capacity aerial bombs which are beyond our 
specialists' range of competency. And, as a rule, all of them 
have the kind of device and are in a condition that they can be 
neither lifted nor transported--they must be defused on the 
spot. Well, you can imagine the difficulties our specialists 
encounter when they discover explosives in densely populated 
residential areas of cities or on the site of an industrial 
enterprise. And in spite of the fact that in such situations it 
is very dangerous to work with the "rusty death" that has been 
discovered, our people defuse them, raise them to the surface, 
and take them to a safe place, where they are exploded. 
  Literally a couple of days ago an ammunition depot from the 
war was discovered in Kiev. And what is to be done with it? Next 
door is a residential building. Accompanied by the president's 
representative in the city and the rayon, we inspected the 
place. A decision has now been made to clear the mines from the 
depot without resettling the residents of the nearby buildings. 
  It is possible to give many examples of our people's 
heroism. 
Especially in gas rescue work. Let us face it, accidents occur 
at our chemically dangerous enterprises. And here our brave 
specialists, as soon as they hear the alarm, boldly go to clean 
up after the accident and fulfill their mission. 
  Or recall Chernobyl. Very many officers and enlisted men of 
civil defense units put their best foot forward there. In 
particular it was our specialists who removed the heavy water 
from the destroyed reactor. 
  Today our people are working indefatigably in spite of all 
the objective and subjective difficulties. First among them I 
would like to note the civil defense chiefs of staff of Lvov 
Oblast Colonel Damir Shafigulin, Kiev--Colonel Vladimir Zinkin, 
and Poltava--Colonel Leonid Martyninko, and the leader of the 
Zaporozhye specialized formation--Boris Udod. I can give the 
names of many self-sacrificing workers and highly qualified 
specialists. But even among them there are those who are the 
best. There are especially many of them among the subordinates 
of Boris Petrovich Udod. Several days ago this collective had 
occasion to participate in the cleanup after the collapse of the 
concrete ceiling of the building of the Zaporozhye Oblast trade 
union association. No mechanized equipment could be used there. 
Therefore the specialists did everything by hand. And in three 
hours the aftermath of the accident had been cleaned up, 
supports had been placed under the vault of the building, and 
everything necessary had been done to make sure that it did not 
collapse completely. 
  This formation has very wide-ranging tasks. It is meant to 
perform emergency rescue work at metallurgical and chemical 
facilities. Its specialists perform difficult jobs for 
prevention, including those that even the personnel of the 
facility refuse to do--they are so difficult and dangerous. 
  Brigade commander Colonel Aleksandr Yevdin, regiment 
commander Yevgeniy Konov, chief of the brigade's engineering 
service Major Vladimir Potapenko, and many other officers enjoy 
well-deserved respect. 
  [Dmitriyev] Few of our readers understand what the words 
"civil defense" really mean. What do your formations do, what is 
the principle of leadership of the country's civil defense? 
  [Grechaninov] The principle of civil defense is 
territorial-production. The chief of the country's civil defense 
is the prime minister, and the civil defense chiefs in the 
oblasts and rayons are representatives of the president of 
Ukraine. At enterprises they are the managers. Each of them has 
a commission for emergencies and nonmilitarized formations. 
Because the volume of work that must be done constitutes a whole 
complex of measures. If, for example, it is necessary to 
resettle people to evacuate them somewhere, someone has to 
provide them with shelter, clothing, food, and medical 
assistance. Finally, jobs must be found for them. And all this 
is the responsibility of the civil defense. Therefore it is the 
task of the civil defense staff and the regional staffs to 
coordinate the actions of the ministries, departments, various 
structures, enterprises, and all organs of power for organized 
work according to a single plan. 
  [Dmitriyev] Well, who is the first to receive the alarm in 
the localities? How is the mechanism for your reaction engaged? 
  [Grechaninov] The existing civil defense system, which is 
now 
being restructured, makes it possible to react rapidly to all 
cataclysms that arise. We have people on duty in our civil 
defense staff headquarters. Plus, in a number of regions (in 
Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, and other oblasts) special groups 
have been created which, if necessary, go to the site and report 
on everything to the civil defense staff and then immediately 
organize the work that is necessary in such situations. 
  Now, according to predictions, the strong winds in 
Transcarpathia are supposed to get up to 40 meters per second. 
We too are preparing for this. Instructions have been given to 
the local areas to reinforce the special repair groups of 
electricians, communications experts, etc. so that it will be 
possible to promptly correct any damage caused by the elements. 
In general, all the work is being done for prevention in 
Transcarpathia. 
  [Dmitriyev] Transcarpathia now has a difficult situation 
caused by the mountain rivers overflowing their banks. Large 
regions have been flooded and many villages have suffered. 
Assistance is needed in resettling people from the destroyed 
homes. Are your people participating in the rescue work there? 
  [Grechaninov] Most actively. It is possible to give many 
examples of self-sacrificing participation of our subdivisions 
in all the work. It is difficult even to single anybody out. The 
people let nothing stop them from rescuing the victims, 
organizing their evacuation, and giving them blood, food, and 
medical assistance. 
  [Dmitriyev] In other words, they are doing their duty 
honorably. Many people are in need of their help. In this 
connection a question arises: What about civil defense itself, 
does it need help from the state? What problems does your 
department have? 
  [Grechaninov] During all of 1993 the collective of the staff 
of the civil defense of Ukraine was working with dedication to 
improve the country's civil defense system. At the same time 
objective difficulties, primarily financial ones, are impacting 
the effectiveness of the measures we are taking. Thus the chief 
of civil defense is the prime minister. His frequent replacement 
has a negative impact on the state of affairs... 
  In order to carry out the difficult task in the region that 
is affected the specialists need special equipment, instruments, 
means of personal protection, etc. And all this requires the 
corresponding material expenditures. Unfortunately, financial 
matters become worse each year. Although one should understand 
that the more money that is invested in measures for prevention 
of accidents and emergencies, the lower the cost of cleaning up 
after them. 
  [Dmitriyev] Nonetheless, your department has a considerable 
potential of its own. Are any attempts being made to take 
advantage of internal reserves? 
  [Grechaninov] Understanding the difficulty of the economic 
situation in the country, of course, we are assessing its 
capabilities realistically and searching for additional 
reserves, including in international activity. In particular, 
civil defense of Russia has received tens of millions of dollars 
for delivering humanitarian aid cargo through the UN. And this 
year we too want to become involved in the implementation of the 
humanitarian aid programs of this international organization. 
  We are now very much in need of money. Because we have 
conceived and are working on one necessary system. 
  [Dmitriyev] One wonders what it is needed for, if, of 
course, 
it is not a secret. 
  [Grechaninov] Our specialists are working on a system of 
notification which would automatically inform the civil defense 
staff if an accident occurs at a dangerous enterprise. And then 
it would not make any difference whether the manager wanted to 
inform us of this promptly or not--we would have our own 
information about what happened. Remember how much time they 
remained silent about the accidents at the Beloyarsk and 
Chernobyl nuclear power plants?... 
  We have already achieved certain results in this area. We 
are 
now automatically receiving information from a number of 
facilities with chemical and radiation danger. But we must make 
sure that this is a system that will enable us to monitor 
completely everything that can present a threat to the life and 
health of the population. 
  Furthermore, in keeping with the concept of civil defense, 
each regiment has an emergency rescue battalion on 30-minute 
alert, and in the brigade there are two. In other words, the 
personnel of these subdivisions are prepared to move with their 
technical equipment to the site of the contamination within a 
half hour. But we are not satisfied with the questions of 
financing. We need money to buy means of minor mechanization, 
technical equipment, instruments, etc. The quality of the 
emergency rescue work depends directly on this. 
  [Dmitriyev] From all that has been said, one can draw the 
conclusion that your department has concerns 24 hours a day. 
Just take ecology. What "presents" the elements sometimes throws 
in your way... 
  [Grechaninov] You are right about that. Just yesterday we 
had 
to solve a problem that arose before us: Ice was floating on the 
rivers on the territory of Belarus. So we can expect it on our 
territory soon as well, on the Dnieper. The threat is that 
enormous amounts of water can accumulate, and they are capable 
of washing away dams in the region of the 30-kilometer zone of 
Chernobyl... So we are now working in close cooperation with the 
Ministry of Water Management of Ukraine, the hydrometeorological 
service, and our Belarusian colleagues. 
  [Dmitriyev] In other words, you have international ties and 
contacts as well... 
  [Grechaninov] Quite right. One of the tasks of our civil 
defense system is international activity for rendering 
humanitarian aid and peace-making efforts. We are working on 
bilateral agreements with our neighboring states--Poland, 
Slovakia, and Belarus--so that in the event of a situation on 
both sides of the border it would be possible to coordinate our 
actions in matters of civil defense and localize the 
consequences through joint efforts. 
  Incidentally, in a recent critique of a recent joint 
strategic staff training session President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk concretized the tasks for the establishment of 
international contacts of the country's civil defense. 
  This is what I wanted to note. We have a unique center for 
modeling and predicting catastrophes. There is nothing like it 
in Europe. Now our specialists can quickly and concretely model 
one or another situation and its possible consequences. It has 
already been tested repeatedly. This makes it possible to 
promptly take correct and timely actions, beginning with 
removing people, evacuating them, so that they do not end up in 
the affected zone, and ending with cleaning up the aftermath. 
  The center has been visited by representatives of the UN, 
and 
apparently this organization is going to ask us to model for 
other countries the possible variants of the development of 
events in the case of the appearance of one emergency situation 
or another. 
  [Dmitriyev] As I understand it, this order will not be free 
of charge... 
  [Grechaninov] Of course it will be possible to earn foreign 
currency for the state this way. 
  [Dmitriyev] But how does the interaction between our civil 
defense and that of neighboring states occur in practice? Are 
there examples? 
  [Grechaninov] As one example, I can discuss the following. 
In 
Izmail in Odessa Oblast we have a pulp and cardboard combine 
which has large amounts of chlorine. Last summer there was a 
fire there which threatened to cause a discharge of a 
considerable quantity of substances that are dangerous to the 
health, and not only of city dwellers but also of the population 
on the territory of the neighboring state--Romania. Within 20 
minutes after the signal was received in the civil defense staff 
headquarters, both the president and the prime minister had on 
their desks the conclusions and suggestions necessary for making 
a decision. Our border guards and other departments were 
promptly notified. The corresponding information was also sent 
to the Romanian Embassy, for which the government of this state 
expressed its gratitude to us. 
  [Dmitriyev] On this holiday I want to wish happiness and 
good 
health to you and all who work and serve with you in the civil 
defense of Ukraine. And that you have fewer occasions to go to 
disaster zones! 
  [Grechaninov] Unfortunately, the number of accidents and 
catastrophes is not decreasing. Contributions toward the cleanup 
are immense. And under the conditions of today's economy this is 
a difficult burden which it has to bear. Therefore, we will do 
everything we can to protect the country's economy by reducing 
the number of catastrophes and the difficulty of cleaning up 
their aftermath. Because there is a certain pattern here. The 
more powerful and richer the civil defense, the fewer the 
preconditions for accidents and other emergency situations, and 
the less it is necessary to spend on cleaning up after them.

<F P=106> [Article by Petr Pavlyuk, reviewer, Ukrainian Navy Press </F>
Center: "On the Matter of Financing the Black Sea Fleet: When 
Half-Truth is Offered as Truth"] 
  [Text] A number of 
articles on the financing of the Black Sea Fleet have recently 
appeared in the mass media. A number of serious complaints were 
expressed in them, as well as in Ostankino broadcasts, addressed 
to Ukraine and its Ministry of Defense. Accusations were made 
that joint Ukrainian-Russian agreements on the fleet's financing 
were being violated. A number of figures are cited in this 
regard. For example, of the total credit of 96,977,700 
karbovantsy allocated to the fleet as of 29 October 1993, 
Ukraine's share is only 22.6 percent, while in recent times it 
has grown even smaller. 
  These and other data are cited with the blessing of the 
chief 
of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet. Strange as it 
may seem, for some reason not one of the authors of the articles 
tried to discover the opinion of the other 
side--Ukraine--regarding these truly painful issues, and 
acquaint readers with it. 
  To correct this omission I turned to the chief of the 
financial service of the Ukrainian Navy, Colonel Viktor 
Kobernik, who had participated as an expert in drafting and 
adopting the joint Ukrainian-Russian agreement on financing the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  "All numerical computations and financial data need to be 
meticulously checked in order to confirm or refute them," he 
emphasized. "Yet there are complaints against Ukraine that its 
Ministry of Defense should be allowed the possibility to carry 
out a documentary financial audit of the Black Sea Fleet jointly 
with representatives of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense, in order to determine where money for the fleet is 
coming from, in what amounts, and where and for what needs it is 
being spent, who is overpaying, who is underpaying, and so on." 
  However, initiatives undertaken on this account by the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense in February, and then in July of 
last year, were rejected for some reason by the Russian side. 
This is despite the fact that according to statute the military 
districts (fleets) must undergo documentary financial audits not 
less than once every two years. And the last audit in the Black 
Sea Fleet was in July 1991. Had it occurred as required, in 
1993, there probably would not have been any need for law 
enforcement agencies to investigate criminal cases associated 
with major material and financial abuses in the mine and torpedo 
arsenal base, and in the Black Sea Fleet fuel service. 
  The joint agreement on financing the Black Sea Fleet in the 
transitional period (to 1995), drawn up and initialed in 
February of last year, foresees participation of Ukraine and 
Russia in equal shares of 50 percent. This agreement was 
subsequently confirmed in April 1993. 
  When the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea 
Fleet announces that Ukraine's share in fleet financing was only 
22.6 percent as of the end of October, and even lower after 
that, the personnel and the blue and white collar workers of the 
fleet develop a negative attitude toward the Ukrainian side. It 
is obviously this goal that the articles recently published on 
these issues pursue. 
  However, the sad thing is that lies are being offered as 
truth, and many things are deliberately not being said, with the 
blessing of Colonel A. Zhukov. In particular, the chief of the 
financial service of the Black Sea Fleet has to know that 
Ukraine provided for 100 percent of the Black Sea Fleet's 
financing throughout practically all of 1992 and from 1 January 
1993 to May 1993. Mutual settlements regarding these expenses 
have still not been carried out. 
  Now about how the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet 
is 
manipulating the figures. 
  Yes, according to agreements Ukraine's share should be 50 
percent. By Colonel A. Zhukov's calculations this share is 
presently something else. But once again he is holding back a 
great deal of information. For example, about the amounts upon 
which his computations are based. The agreement does not allow 
unilateral financial actions. Even so, Russia unilaterally 
decided to introduce payment for the difference between the 
karbovanets and the ruble into the Black Sea Fleet. The Russian 
Federation Ministry of Defense also unilaterally assumed the 
responsibility of paying the expenses for this item. Thus, these 
expenses should not be included in Ukraine's percent share. 
  Nor can the Ukrainian side assume responsibility for half of 
the expenses of maintaining those vessels and ships that raised 
the flag of St. Andrew. It would be wrong, after all, for any 
self-respecting power to pay those who insult its national worth! 
  Some other nuances of this complex problem could be brought 
up as well. 
  As they say, money likes to be counted. And it is precisely 
such an accounting that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense 
proposes. It is completely incomprehensible why the RF Ministry 
of Defense and the Black Sea Fleet are opposed to this. You 
would think that they should be the ones who are most interested 
in clarifying and resolving the arising misunderstandings. 
  I would like to pass along another extremely interesting 
fact. 
  In early December 1993 the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense 
appropriated 21 billion karbovantsy in payment of the Black Sea 
Fleet's debt to ship repair plants. It wanted to be sure that 
the enterprise collectives would receive their wages in time. 
The financing was carried out according to established procedure 
by the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy. However, on 8 
December the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea 
Fleet returned the money to us with the following explanation: 
"The indicated amount will be credited to the budget account of 
the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet by decision of the 
Black Sea Fleet commander only if the transfer is made directly 
by the financial directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Defense, and not through the Ukrainian Navy." 
  It is incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet took the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry's attempt to finance the ship repair 
plants through the financial and economic directorate of the 
Russian Navy as such an insult. And the latter grossly violated 
the February agreement, which prescribes transfer of money to 
the Black Sea Fleet through the Ukrainian National Bank, by 
using the services of commercial structures; for example, to the 
Omtek-Biznes firm through the Mosbiznesbank. This choice was 
made by the Russian side. As for why, who knows? 
  On the other hand, throughout all of 1993 Ukraine 
insistently 
offered to continue 100 percent financing of the Black Sea Fleet 
through centralized mutual settlements with the RF Ministry of 
Defense through the National Bank (50 by 50 percent), as is 
foreseen by the joint February agreement. In this case any 
interruptions in issuing pay and other payments to the personnel 
would have been excluded. 
  There is one other tactical maneuver of the Black Sea Fleet 
command I would like to discuss. It's no secret to us that many 
Black Sea Fleet admirals and officers capitalize on various 
loopholes to get their pay in rubles much more often than once a 
year (when departing on leave). Subsequently converting them 
into karbovantsy in various ways, they acquire a good "nest 
egg." This is hardly to the liking of the officers, shore-based 
and seagoing warrant officers, and employees of the Black Sea 
Fleet whose position does not allow them to do this. 
  In short, there are many financial nuances in the Black Sea 
Fleet, ones which the command has no intention of discussing 
fully. And as a distracting maneuver, various insinuations are 
being made and a purposeful effort is being conducted to 
influence public opinion and arouse negative emotions. It is 
obviously precisely for these reasons that the Black Sea Fleet 
will never agree to such inspections, and all the more so to a 
documentary financial audit. Even though this would be the best 
way to shed some light on the real state of affairs.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuliya Khaytina: "General, You'll Never Be a </F>
Schwartzkopf: Ukraine Continues to Play `War' With the Black Sea 
Fleet"] 
  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet clearly isn't bored. This week 
the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI published a report from a 
press conference held by Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General 
Vitaliy Radetskyy: In this own words, Mr. Radetskiy wouldn't 
want to have to liberate Crimea like the Americans did Kuwait. 
  This happened not long before the presidential elections in 
Crimea. On the backdrop of the command-and-staff exercise held 
by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 24 to 27 January, the 
general's uplifted spirits evoked a response from the Black Sea 
Fleet press center. "The absence of such a desire on the part of 
General V. Radetskyy (to transform Crimea into Kuwait.--Author) 
inspires great hopes for maintaining peace and stability in 
Crimea," read a statement by the Black Sea Fleet press center. 
In this case "the Black Sea Fleet command doubts that the 
general could become a Schwartzkopf, despite the fact that the 
army has nurtured many handsome, young and promising generals. 
Operation Desert Storm, which General Schwartzkopf led, occurred 
in a totally different situation, and it had nothing in common 
with the well publicized statement `Crimea will be Ukrainian or 
a desert'." Moreover "the Desert Storm peacekeeping action was 
carried out under a well-tuned command and control system using 
common terminology, and it was supported by the 
military-economic potential of 14 states. On the other 
hand...the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have a unified command 
and control system, and assimilation of military terminology is 
one of the problems. The fact that participation of the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces in the celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of the liberation of Kiev was treated by the troops 
as an exercise inspires confidence in their peaceful nature," 
the Black Sea Fleet press center subtly notes. 
  Another unique message came to Black Sea Fleet chief of 
staff 
Petr Svetashov in the form of a telegram from Ukrainian Navy 
chief of staff Aleksiy Ryzhenko: "We will consider the Black Sea 
Fleet marine brigade to be a FOREIGN FORMATION on Ukrainian 
territory." "This `gift' is dedicated to the brigade's 
exercises," explained acting chief of the Black Sea Fleet press 
center Andrey Grachev to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. "It's as if we 
don't have the right to conduct exercises without giving advance 
notice to the Ukrainian side. But there isn't a single document 
that foresees such a thing in relation to what is still the 
Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet." 
  The Yalta agreement, which declared the Black Sea Fleet to 
be 
Russian-Ukrainian, and approved subordination of the fleet's 
main command to two presidents, was and remains the sole legal 
basis for actions of the Black Sea Fleet. To its deep misfortune 
the staff of the Ukrainian Navy has no right to "consent to" 
exercises or display any other such attention to units of the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  It is altogether difficult to count the number of "petty" 
accusations that have been levied against the Black Sea Fleet by 
Ukraine. Ask Black Sea Fleet commanders why they buy uniforms in 
Russia, and watch their eyes pop out: "If Ukraine can't make 
uniforms, are you saying we should go naked?' is the reply. 
According to our unofficial data, by the way, General Radetskyy 
himself bought eight pairs of uniform trousers for 8,000 rubles, 
and is now going around in a Soviet officer's uniform. 
  By the way, the Black Sea Fleet itself gets little pleasure 
from this "war." The Massandrovskiy Russian-Ukrainian Protocol 
of 1993, which transfers the Black Sea Fleet to Russia in 
exchange for cancellation of part of Ukraine's debts, has still 
not been ratified. The Black Sea Fleet remains in limbo. Black 
Sea Fleet servicemen are not protected by a single law, inasmuch 
as "they don't belong" to either country, and Russian-Ukrainian 
dual citizenship still doesn't exist. Despite all of this, 95 
percent of the officers feel themselves to be Russian citizens. 
Wages have not been paid to servicemen since December. But it 
would be more than immodest to talk about the collapse of the 
navy: The Black Sea Fleet took second place among all fleets of 
the former Union on the basis of the year's results. Black Sea 
Fleet ships proved their combat capability when they evacuated 
60,000 refugees from Poti.

  At his first press conference Yuriy Meshkov, the newly 
elected president of Crimea, announced that a referendum on 
self-determination will be held in Crimea in March. 
  It became known to us from unofficial sources in Kiev that 
in 
response to such actions by the Crimean side, Ukraine will not 
ratify the agreement to remove nuclear warheads from Ukrainian 
territory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Ukrainian Navy press center: "Is </F>
the Mirror Guilty of the Eyesore?"] 
  [Text] A program on Russian radio of February 2 of this 
year quoted the expression of a representative of the ChF [Black 
Sea Fleet] command that the delays in paying servicemen in the 
fleet are occurring owing to the lack of cash at the banks of 
Ukraine. 
  The press center of the Navy of Ukraine reports that this is 
just the latest disinformation. Ukrsotsbank [Ukrainian Social 
Bank] acting director T.I. Shcherban has informed us that "there 
has been not a single delay in pay over the course of 1993 due 
to a lack of cash at the Sevastopol branch of the Ukrsotsbank." 
  The chief reason for the delays in issuing pay is the 
absence 
of funds in the accounts of the Black Sea Fleet, and its many 
billions in debt. 
  The city budget is also suffering for the same reasons, 
since 
the Black Sea Fleet is not making timely payments for electric 
power, water, ship repairs, capital construction and other items. 
  The disruptions in the financing of the fleet often occur 
because of the unwarranted ambitions of its command. It refused 
to settle up the amount of 21 million karbovantsi with MO 
[Ministry of Defense] of Ukraine last year for the financing of 
the shipyards of the ChF, for example, only because it had gone 
through the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy. 
  Certainly no requests whatsoever were received from the ChF 
by the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy, either in 
December or in January of this year, for the transfer of funds. 
  This stance can elicit only surprise. Objecting to the fact 
that the MO of Ukraine has financed the ChF through the 
financial service of the Navy, its command for some reason has 
no objections to the analogous actions by the MO of the Russian 
Federation, which also finances the ChF not directly, but rather 
through the economic and financial directorate of the Russian 
Navy. The ChF also does not object to the financing of its 
Russian side through commercial structures, and that goes 
against the requirements of the joint agreement between Russia 
and Ukraine on questions of financing. 
  The disinformation in the fleet community on these issues is 
none other than an attempt by certain parties in the ChF to 
evoke a negative attitude toward Ukraine and its Ministry of 
Defense and Navy. That serves only those who are striving not to 
strengthen friendship and mutual understanding, but rather to 
fan further the hubbub surrounding the problems of the Black Sea 
Fleet and further destabilize the situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain 3rd Rank Oleh Chubuk: "The Ukrainian </F>
Navy--Truly the People's Fleet"] 
  [Text] More than three hundred million karbovantsi in "net 
form" for building the Navy of Ukraine have come in since April 
of 1993 from citizens, institutions, enterprises and 
organizations around the country. Those sending the funds 
moreover often indicated their specific purpose. Zaporizhzhya 
Oblast, for instance, sent 100 million karbovantsi for the 
construction of housing for naval servicemen, the Ternopil 
Oblast Union of Officers of Ukraine sent seven million 
karbovantsi for the construction of the patrol craft Bayda 
Vyshnevetskyy, and the inhabitants of the city of Snyatyna in 
Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast sent more than five million karbovantsi 
for the construction of the small ASW ship Pokuttya. The mayor 
of the city of Lutsk sent the Ukrainian Navy written 
notification of the remittance of 30 million karbovantsi 
simultaneously with the commissioning of the small ASW craft 
Lutsk on February 12 of this year. 
  The naval forces of Ukraine are thus truly the people's 
fleet, as is proven time and again by the financial assistance 
that comes to account No. 200141400, MFO 324106 at the 
Sevastopol office of the Ukrsotsbank in the city of Sevastopol.

  [Text] A telegram addressed to head of the Ivano-Frankivsk 
Regional Administration of the Prominvestbank of Ukraine Ivanny 
Barny has arrived from Commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine 
Vice-Admiral V. Bezkorovaynyy. 
  He expresses thanks in it to the bankers for their patriotic 
attitude toward the problems of building the Ukrainian Fleet. 
The sailors also provide assurances that the funds sent by the 
bank will be utilized to build housing for Ukrainian sailors and 
provide social protections for them. The telegram from the 
vice-admiral is a reaction to the noble deed of the employees of 
the Prominvestbank administration, who at the end of last year 
allocated a hefty sum to one of the military units for the 
construction of housing and other needs of the sailors.

  [Text] The initial plans to refine the Varyah [Varyag] 
aircraft carrier are impossible, but it could still be made into 
a floating airfield, feels the new director of the Black Sea 
Shipyard Ihor Ovdiyenko. Ukraine itself cannot complete the 
building of this ship, says the head of the largest shipyard in 
Ukraine. The Varyah meanwhile occupies a quay, creating problems 
with its utilization and causing expenses for servicing it in a 
mothballed state. The plant cannot independently resolve the 
issue of cutting up or selling the ship. A great deal of money 
has moreover been invested in the Varyah, and courage is needed 
to dare to give up on it now.

Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shydrya: "The Admiral Has Questions, 
But the Sailors From Ukraine Can Only Remain Silent"] 
  [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet [ChF] Eduard 
Baltin, accompanying Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov during his 
visit to Sevastopol, himself began asking the journalists 
questions instead of giving answers. "Who drew the borders of 
Ukraine?" asked the admiral. And immediately in the same spirit: 
"Ukraine had five oblasts within the 1939 borders, and has 26 
now. Who has been pursuing an imperial policy--Russia or 
Ukraine?" (The admiral, by the way, made a "trifling" 
arithmetical error here, for some reason counting Ukraine with 
26 oblasts instead of the 24.) 
  Noting the embarrassment of the representatives of the mass 
media, who had in no way expected such attacks directed at 
Ukraine from the commander of the fleet of the two nations, 
Admiral Eduard Baltin promised that "our people" would soon be 
able to meet with him for a more detailed discussion on that 
topic. 
  So now here is Admiral Baltin, who has gained a reputation 
as 
a cautious commander, not concealing his antipathy toward 
Ukraine and starting to talk the language of the odious Russian 
leaders. This visibly reflects the situation in the ChF, whose 
commander fulfills only orders from the Russian Navy. The 
uniform of the armed forces of Russia with the corresponding 
insignia has been introduced in the fleet, in violation of the 
Yalta agreements. Draftees from Ukraine, making up 50 percent of 
the fleet, are being indoctrinated in the spirit of loyalty to 
the Russian leadership... Need we be surprised that the 
commander of the fleet is now proposing that we think where the 
state border of Ukraine should really be, starting the division 
into "ours" and "not ours"? 
  Just whose interests does the command of the Black Sea Fleet 
intend to protect on the territory of Ukraine?

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA commentator Serhiy Zhurets under </F>
the rubric "Details on the Fact": "It is Called the An-70"] 
  [Text] NARODNA ARMIYA has already reported that the family 
of airliners developed at the aviation scientific and technical 
complex imeni Oleg Antonov has been supplemented with a new 
aircraft. Its name is the An-70. Three countries--Ukraine, 
Russia and Kazakhstan--are planning to build this beauty. That 
is why the national colors of those countries adorn the fuselage 
of the first, and as yet sole, specimen of the An-70 transport 
aircraft. The chief customers are the ministries of defense of 
Ukraine and Russia, whose cooperation in the development and 
production of the new transport aircraft is based on an 
international agreement signed by representatives of the 
governments of Russia and Ukraine. It is thus understandable 
that those military agencies have a vested interest in having in 
the arsenal of their military-transport aviation an aircraft 
that conforms entirely to all contemporary requirements. So even 
though the first models of the new military-transport aircraft 
will appear in the air regiments at best in 1996-97, it is worth 
becoming acquainted with the An-70 more closely. 
  The An-70 was created to ship cargo and vehicles, and the 
need for such an aircraft in the armed forces of Ukraine is 
explained by the fact that the principal military-transport 
aircraft today, the An-12, has already become outmoded and is in 
essence awaiting replacement. The An-70 could indeed become that 
reliable replacement. 
  In order to understand better why it is this aircraft that 
specialists consider an achievement in the field of aircraft 
construction, we turn to the American [as published] weekly 
JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, which had publicized the characteristics 
of the aircraft and commented on them professionally long before 
the ceremony to roll out the first An-70 had taken place in 
Kiev. They equated the characteristics of the An-70 with the 
capabilities of the C-130 base military-transport aircraft of 
the NATO countries. 
  American experts feel that creation of the design for a 
transport aircraft for the VPS [Air Forces] is not a 
particularly difficult task. It is, however, considerably more 
difficult to embody in the plans tactical performance 
characteristics that would fully take into account the 
contemporary requirements of the troops in the area of 
transporting personnel and hardware from their permanent base 
locations to a conflict zone. Effectiveness in the performance 
of rapid troop movements or their redeployment is defined by the 
quantity of cargo shipped over a certain time. And it is better 
in that case to have, for example, two aircraft of smaller 
dimensions than one large aircraft, since that provides an 
opportunity to utilize twice as many loading and unloading areas. 
  Such characteristics as the length of the runway and the 
capability of the aircraft to perform maneuvers outside the 
boundaries of it, as well as the overall cost of the aircraft, 
are important requirements among those posed toward 
military-transport aircraft. Proceeding from that, foreign 
specialists indicate that all of those requirements have been 
well balanced in the design of the An-70. It does not exceed any 
of the now-existing similar aircraft in dimensions, speed or 
flight range, but the sum of the characteristics embodied in the 
An-70 is almost ideal compared to other military-transport 
aircraft. The An-70, created based on the use of not very 
complex technologies, will possibly be quite advantageous from 
the standpoint of acquisition and utilization. Any other 
aircraft would require additional funds for its production, but 
the An-70 is able to make the greatest contribution to the state 
of the world aviation market among other developments of 
military aircraft. 
  I would remind you that these conclusions are being drawn by 
foreign aviation specialists, who can scarcely be suspected of 
sympathy toward the achievements of Ukrainian aviation designers 
and aircraft builders. 
  Now, the characteristics of the An-70 in more concrete 
detail: 
  The aircraft can ship cargo weighing up to 30-35 tonnes 
distances of 4,000-5,000 kilometers at a speed of 750 km/hr. 
  The aircraft, depending on the missions, has a takeoff 
weight 
between 100 and 130 tonnes, and can be based either at permanent 
concrete airfields with runways as long as 1,800-2,200 meters, 
or on short unimproved landing zones as long as 600-800 meters. 
This means that the An-70 can be utilized on 80 percent of the 
airfields in the CIS, while foreign aircraft in this class can 
use only half of all existing airfields. The capability of the 
An-70 to take off and land on short unimproved landing areas 
provides an opportunity to deliver cargo directly to its 
intended destination, which is exceedingly important when one 
takes into account the requirements of wartime. 
  The dimensions of the cargo bay of the An-70 medium 
transport 
aircraft are of great significance. Its volume is a third larger 
than that of the Il-76 aircraft, and three times larger than the 
An-12, Hercules and Transall aircraft. 
  "The cargo bay of the An-70 makes it possible to transport 
all of the military hardware and weaponry of the CIS and NATO 
countries," the advertising prospectus states. In describing the 
An-70 in more detail, however. I will give the data that were 
cited by the American specialists evaluating it: "The aircraft 
can hold an M2/M3 Bradley in non-dismantled form, an M-109 
howitzer (the equivalent of our 2S3), a towed howitzer with 
prime mover, and the PVO-2S6 mobile system with the Sa-11 SAM 
launcher." 
  The cargo bay of the An-70, unlike the An-12, Il-76, 
Hercules 
and Transall domestic and foreign aircraft, can hold cargo in 
two rows. 
  A whole series of innovations were employed in the 
development and construction of the new medium transport 
aircraft. I will dwell only on those that have a direct bearing 
on the operation of the An-70. 
  A power plant with propfan engines has been installed on a 
transport aircraft for the first time. The engines were 
developed and built by the engine builders of Zaporizhzhya, and 
the propfans by the Russian design bureau in the city of 
Stupino. Taking into account the growing requirements for fuel 
expenditure, it should be pointed out that it is only 160 grams 
per tonne-kilometer for the An-70. By way of comparison, the 
An-12 required three times as much fuel, and the Il-76 twice as 
much, as the An-70 for the shipment of 20 tonnes of cargo 3,000 
km during their use as the standard medium cargo-transport 
aircraft. 
  A system of control of the aircraft equipment that automates 
the performance of piloting tasks was also used on the An-70 
aircraft for the first time in the CIS; this has made it 
possible to reduce the number of control panels and the demands 
on the crew. The information-display system was built on the 
basis of full-color screen indicators that bring up everything 
the pilots need -- piloting and navigational data, information 
on the functioning, failure and defectiveness of on-board 
systems and aircraft equipment, reference information and 
recommendations. Thus, I expect it will be an utter pleasure for 
the crew of three individuals to fly the An-70.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F>
Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya under the rubric "A 
Journalist Covering a Problem": "The Aircraft Are Out of Order, 
But the Aircraft Repair Enterprises Stand Idle"] 
  [Text] A report appeared in the press not very long ago 
that just half of the aviation hardware of the Air Forces of 
Ukraine is in a combat-capable state. I will not take it upon 
myself to refute that information, I would only point out that 
there are aircraft and helicopters that are not combat-ready or 
have limited readiness in the 14th Air Army. Moreover, most of 
them are the rotary-winged craft from army aviation that were 
until recently under the subordination of the PrykVO [Carpathian 
Military District]. One of my features already talked about the 
17 Mi-26 helicopters that are standing idle without main rotors 
(NA of 29 December 1993). 
  Whatever the quantity of faulty aviation hardware, however, 
it must evoke anxiety among all of the officials connected with 
it. The more so as it will increase with every day if the 
appropriate measures are not taken. The paradox consists of the 
fact that there are getting to be more and more faulty aircraft, 
while the operation of the aircraft repair enterprises is 
slowing down or even coming to a halt. It is also worth noting 
that there are more than fifteen aircraft-repair plants (ARZs) 
in Ukraine. They are not only capable of repairing all of the 
disabled aircraft and helicopters, but also of filling orders 
for the repair of aviation hardware from other states, which 
would provide quite a bit of currency receipts for the state 
coffers. But... 
  I will show how matters look using the example of the 
aircraft repair plant in Lviv. That collective has been headed 
for quite a long time now by Colonel Vyacheslav Kupch. He came 
to that enterprise as a lieutenant to the assembly shop, so he 
knows the business he is engaged in very well. And this allows 
him even during these difficult times to keep the "ship" afloat, 
so to speak, which is quite difficult. 
  The Lviv ARZ has specialized in the repair of MiG aircraft 
since its very creation. It has a good technical base, skilled 
specialists and solid ties with other enterprises for the 
performance of all repair operations. So they have everything 
for the performance of their appointed duties. They even 
recently mastered the repair of the most modern MiG-29 fighter. 
And that was at their own expense. (The state, through the 
Ministry of Defense, did not allocate a single karbovanets to 
them for it). 
  The enterprise, moreover, started to repair that type of 
aircraft last year, and has returned six MiG aircraft to their 
units. 
  But even greater difficulties have appeared. The first is 
finances, since the Ministry of Defense has not paid for any of 
the aircraft. It turned out that the plant workers themselves 
suffered from their own initiative in mastering repair of the 
MiG-29... 
  The difficult situation has also affected the aircraft 
repair 
plant in Lutsk, which specializes in the repair of jet engines 
for aircraft. Here, also at their own initiative and at their 
own expense, they mastered the repair of the RD-33 engines that 
are used on the MiG-29. They have repaired several of the units. 
But they have not been paid a single karbovanets for it. The 
work has thus been halted at the plant since December of last 
year. The workers have been sent on "vacation." Many of them 
have already found new jobs, and certainly will not return to 
the enterprise. The costly equipment is standing idle. The 
plant, in short, is collapsing. 
  The Ministry of Defense, of course, is not failing to settle 
up with the repair plants out of some whim or ambition. It 
simply has no money. There is not even enough money, as is well 
known, to pay the servicemen. 
  I remind you of the popular saying of penny wise, pound 
foolish. And when someone hits upon the idea of "economizing" 
through the payments to the repair enterprises, then we will 
have to pay not twice as much, but tens of times more. And as 
early as today. If the ARZ stops working, the aircraft have to 
be sent to Russia for repairs, and that requires hard currency. 
  Budgetary financing, of course, is the main source for the 
enterprises of the Ministry of Defense, but it is far from the 
only one. They could also find their own, quite significant 
sources, and that without considerable efforts. Here are a few. 
  The author of these lines has already had occasion to write 
about 164 aircraft that have been repaired and are being 
preserved at the ARZ in Lviv. These are aircraft that are not 
needed in practice to arm the Air Forces of Ukraine. But other 
countries could acquire them for their armies. So why not sell 
that surplus aviation hardware while it can still find buyers, 
and organize the repair of our own aircraft using the funds 
received? 
  This question sounds almost rhetorical, since it has already 
been asked at various levels more than once. But weeks, months 
and even years are passing, and no one will make the decision. 
The aircraft are thus standing idle, growing functionally and 
physically obsolete, to the benefit of no one. The plant, on the 
contrary, suffered losses of some 726 million karbovantsy for 
the upkeep of the aforementioned 164 aircraft last year; the 
total will be considerably higher this year. 
  Quite a few repaired engines have accumulated at the ARZ in 
Lutsk that are also not needed by the Air Forces of Ukraine, and 
in such quantity that they exceed a five-year supply. They could 
also be sold. A significant portion of the assemblies that are 
removed from aircraft destroyed in accordance with international 
agreements could also be offered for sale. Quite a bit that 
could be sold abroad, getting profits where there are losses 
today, could certainly be found at other ARZs as well. 
  But unfortunately no one is occupied with this. Rather, 
there 
is no one to be occupied with it, since the aircraft repair 
plants do not have the right or the capability, while the the 
corresponding structure has not been created in the directorate 
of the Air Forces. 
  There is yet another way to obtain funds--to perform repairs 
on the aviation hardware of other states. The Lviv ARZ repaired 
several aircraft for Poland last year, and was paid in hard 
currency for it. Those funds, by the way, were spent to master 
the repair of the MiG-29 and maintain the operability of the 
enterprise. 
  The plant will have the opportunity to repair aircraft that 
are in service with the armies of Western Europe, India and some 
others in the future as well. But concluding agreements 
independently at the international level is outside the scope of 
authority of Colonel Kupch and his subordinates. A coordinating 
body in the Air Forces directorate is required here once again. 
It is also required in order to plan and analyze the work of the 
ARZs and place state orders. Its absence led to the fact that 
some enterprises last year were engaged in the repair of 
aviation hardware that is not in service in Ukraine. 
  A situation has moreover taken shape today where there is 
not 
a single order for the targets of the ARZs that would stipulate 
the product range and volume of repairs of aviation hardware. 
This means that there is no legal basis for payment for the 
output for military purposes that would be produced by the 
enterprises. 
  There are many other problems as well, connected with the 
fact that no one wants or is able to coordinate the affairs of 
the ARZs. They are left, so to speak, to the whims of fate, 
under the slogan of "every man for himself." So it ends up that 
Lutsk and some other plants have shut down, while Lviv, in order 
to survive, is engaged in the production of kitchen furnishings, 
medical instruments and even the assembly of intercity buses. 
That is possibly necessary, but the main thing for them is the 
repair of aircraft for the Air Forces of Ukraine. And they are 
not letting the plant pursue that business. So it turns out that 
almost half of the aircraft are out of order, but the aircraft 
repair plants are standing idle.

"Someone Is Obviously Interfering With the Russian Radar"] 
  [Text] On 28 February at 01:24 am Moscow time, an 
electrical transmission line support was blown up in the 
direction of Brotseny five kilometers south of the Russian 
Army's Skrunda Radar Facility. 
  A commission consisting of representatives of Latvenergo 
[Latvian Energy], the criminal police and the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense Skrunda Radar Site drove out to the site of 
the explosion. The commission officially established that the 
explosion of the electrical transmission line support was 
sabotage. Two days are required to restore the support. Work 
began on the morning of 1 March.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F>
under the "Events and Comments" rubric: "Explosion Occurred 
After Midnight"; first paragraph is KRASNAYA ZVEZDA introduction] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Who Benefits from Skrunda Radar Station Sabotage? </H5>
  As reported in the 2 March edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, on 28 
February a concrete support of a 110-kilovolt power transmission 
line was destroyed by an explosion occurring in Ranskaya Volost 
of Latvia, 5 kilometers from the Skrunda Radar Station. This 
high-voltage line supplies the Skrunda Radar Station with power. 
  According to Edgar Birkans, director of high-voltage 
networks, power transmission from Brotseny was cut off at 00.25 
just after midnight on 28 February due to a damaged support. The 
RLS [radar station] was not affected, however, since it is 
provided with its own standby power system. The installation is 
supplied with power via two high-voltage networks emanating from 
Brotseny and Tukus. The damage was found during a morning 
troubleshooting foot tour. Birkans states that the damage, which 
affects only Latvia, is estimated to exceed 4,000 lats. 
  The scene of the occurrence was inspected by a commission 
consisting of representatives of Latvenergo, Latvian criminal 
police, and the Skrunda Radar Station. According to the Press 
Center of the SZGV [Northwestern Troop Grouping], SZGV Commander 
Colonel General Leonid Mayorov discussed the incident with 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. A letter requesting an 
investigation of the incident was sent to Yanis Skrastinsh, 
general prosecutor of Latvia. 
  Laymonis Liyepinsh, chief of Criminal Investigation of the 
Police Department, said the occurrence will be investigated by 
the Kuldigskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office. Bomb specialists have 
been dispatched from Riga. In addition, the Ministry of Defense 
and ZEMESSARGA is conducting a separate investigation. Their job 
of apprehending the offenders will not be an easy one. 
  Laymonis Liyepinsh considers that a political flavor 
attaches 
to the explosion. At a 1 March press conference, representatives 
of the Tevzemey uk Brivibay, the nationalistic faction of the 
Latvian Sejm, were unanimous in describing the incident as a 
"provocation with far-reaching consequences." At the same time, 
Mr. Yakobson, consultant to the faction, went a step further by 
saying that "the explosion was arranged by Russia, or at least 
by those who stand behind her or wish to help her." Well, this 
sounds like the same old tune: Laying the blame on someone else. 
As for the explosion, the SZGV Press Center actually made a 
statement in the Latvian newspapers to the effect that the 
commission inspecting the scene has arrived at the official 
conclusion that the damage caused the transmission line 
constitutes an act of sabotage. 
  Finally, Latvian specialists performed a very rapid, 
high-quality job restoring the damaged transmission line support.

<F P=106> [Articles by Nikolay Usov and Yuriy Shatalov: "`Wild Geese' </F>
Return: Russian Military Commissariats Helped Azerbaijan Recruit 
Mercenaries for War in Karabakh"] 
  [Text] Ivanovo--The widely publicized incident involving 
the organized dispatch of volunteers from Ivanovo Oblast to the 
front lines of that ethnic conflict has for the most part ended 
successfully for them. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA wrote about this in 
December of last year. Let us briefly recount what happened. 
  The police were the first to suspect that something was 
awry. 
Everywhere where you looked at the quiet provincial airport, 
which handles only a few outbound flights, dozens of young men 
-- residents of a number of oblasts in central Russia -- had 
suddenly started gathering. They behaved themselves so brazenly 
that the police officer on duty had to call the city for help. 
  The intoxicated youths made no secret of the fact that they 
were waiting for a plane that would take them to Baku, and from 
there to the combat zone in Karabakh. None of them really knew 
what force they would be fighting in -- the regular army or some 
band. 
  After that there was no word from the "soldiers of fortune" 
for almost two months. Learning the mercenaries' names posed no 
difficulty. It turned out that the 17 Ivanovo youths between the 
ages of 24 and 29 had army experience, and several more than one 
criminal offense. 
  And so the "buyers" from Azerbaijan got what they were 
looking for: A ragtag detachment of cannonfodder ready for 
action. For money these youths were truly prepared to do 
anything. And it is hard to believe that the deal was 
consummated without the tacit consent of military commissariat 
officials. 
  Now the Ivanovo mercenaries have returned home; without 
contracts signed by the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry. Immediately 
upon payment of the agreed-upon sums, the documents were 
circumspectly collected from them. 
  However, the Ivanovo youths were lucky: Only two of them 
remain in hospitals somewhere. But their "colleagues" from 
Tambov, Kaluga, and Vladimir suffered both fatalities and 
missing in action. 
  And that is essentially the whole story of their voyage of 
death. The Federal Counterintelligence Service was able to 
obtain documentary proof that officials of military 
commissariats in a number of Russian cities were involved in the 
illegal recruitment. -- Nikolay Usov, correspondent for the 
oblast newspaper RABOCHIY KRAY. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Vladimir--According to the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service's Vladimir Oblast Administration, 13 mercenaries 
returned home to Vladimir, three in zinc coffins. 
  Who are these young men? How and why did they wind up in 
warring Azerbaijan? Officers of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service Administration who conducted an investigation were able 
to interview many of the "wild geese" who came back and to speak 
with their relatives. They learned some things that are much 
food for thought. 
  For example, the Vladimir mercenaries' average age was 30 to 
35. They were all soldiers and sergeants in the reserve of the 
former Soviet Army. Almost all of them had families and 
children. It was also learned that many of them did not have 
jobs worthy of their ages and health, and so they were unable to 
properly provide for their families and elderly parents. 
Necessity forced them to look for good pay in the army. And 
until a certain point, none of them had entertained the idea of 
serving in the army of another state. Officials of the Vladimir 
Oblast military commissariat, to which they had applied, talked 
about contractual service in Russia's 201st Motorized Infantry 
Division, stationed in Tajikistan. 
  But once the final formalities were completed, some of the 
military commissariat's officers began suggesting that the 
fellows go to Azerbaijan for three months. They set up a meeting 
with representatives of that Caucasus republic's armed forces. 
Many promises were made, far more than a Russian Army recruiter 
could have made: 250,000 rubles and $250 for each month of 
service. In the event of the mercenary's death, his family would 
receive a guaranteed benefit of 5 million rubles. There was 
another, no less important detail that was all but decisive in 
the young men's quickly deciding to go to that "trouble spot." 
  The fact is that the group was made up largely of mechanics 
and drivers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, infantry 
fighting vehicles, and other combat vehicles, whom the 
recruiters needed. The "buyer" from the Transcaucasus assured 
the young men that they would not see combat but work primarily 
in the rear as instructors. 
  It is also curious that the future mercenaries in Vladimir 
signed no contracts. They took the "buyer" at his word and, at 
his request, promised to keep secret everything having to do 
with their departure for Azerbaijan and service in its army. But 
on arriving at the front, the "wild geese" found out very 
quickly that they would not be allowed to sit things out in the 
rear. One fine day the mercenaries were handed automatic rifles 
and ordered into battle. They also later learned that they would 
not be getting the promised $250. And that is when they began to 
sober up. 
  As for the officers of the Vladimir Oblast military 
commissariat who were directly or indirectly involved in the 
recruitment of young Russian men for the Azerbaijan Army, the 
counterintelligence officers know their identities too. To all 
indications, they will not be able to avoid some unpleasantries, 
as the Federal Counterintelligence Service's Vladimir Province 
Administration has forwarded the findings of its investigation 
into the mercenaries' recruitment to the military prosecutor. -- 
Yuriy Shatalov, correspondent. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  From the Editors: We intend to continue to inform 
readers of new instances and circumstances involving the 
recruitment of mercenaries on Russian Federation territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov under the rubric "Tajikistan": "The </F>
Opposition Protests MID Statement: Russia's Military Presence in 
Republic Beefed Up"] 
  [Text] Tajikistan's Islamic Resistance 
Council located in the city of Tulukan in the Afghan province of 
Takhar has disseminated a statement refuting one by the Tajik 
MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] that "militant groups of the 
Islamic resistance are shelling their (that is, government) 
formations from the territory of Afghanistan." 
  Sayyid Abdullo Nuri, council leader, warns that the 
intrigues 
involving the statement are a prelude to a new air raid on the 
camps of Tajik refugees in Afghanistan. 
  At the same time the Russian military are taking new steps 
to 
build up their contingent in Tajikistan. According to reports 
from a highly placed officer in the Russian Ministry of Defense, 
Colonel-General Boris Pyankov plans to conduct exercises by 
"peacekeeping forces" on the territory of the "Tiger Gully" 
reserve, the only place on the planet where rare kinds of plants 
and animals have been protected through the efforts of Soviet 
scientists. The exercises are presently being worked out in 
Moscow at the headquarters for the coordination of military 
operations of the CIS countries. According to another version, 
an echelon of armored equipment has already been sent to 
Tajikistan. 
  In the meantime a blockade of rail lines leading into 
Tajikistan from Uzbekistan continues. More than 1,000 cars of 
freight had built up at border stations by mid-February, the 
delay of which is costing Tajikistan around four billion rubles 
a day. The trains are being plundered, and freight is being 
pilfered from the broken cars. Uzbek authorities are 
simultaneously hampering the removal of freight from Tajikistan. 
According to that same highly-placed officer, Tajikistan's Uzbek 
population is increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with 
Tashkent's policy, which is leading to inter-ethnic reprisals. 
Central Asia's geopolitical structure is now increasingly 
subjected to the influence of Uzbekistan, which is laying claim 
to a leading role in the region by blockading Tajikistan. 
  The officer feels that Russia's role here is actually under 
threat. In 1993 alone it costs the taxpayers 59 billion rubles 
to maintain the Russian Army in Tajikistan. The number of 
casualties is constantly growing, which could lead to 
dissatisfaction on the part of the Russians, as occurred during 
the Soviet-Afghan war. While there is a crisis of authority in 
Afghanistan, neither Moscow nor Tashkent will strive for rapid 
talks between Dushanbe and the opposition. Furthermore, the 
officer states, the buildup of the Russian Army's military 
presence in Tajikistan is absolutely deliberate. As reported 
from the mountain regions of Karategin (Garm), military aircraft 
have carried out raids in the valley each day for the second 
week in a row. There is forced recruitment into the army in 
Dushanbe, and confrontations among government groups continue in 
Kurgan-Tyube.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Kudinov: "They Fly Above the Waves"] </F>
  [Text] A considerable amount of diverse information on 
surface skimmers has recently appeared in the periodical press. 
Many of the articles are associated in this case with the name 
of Rostislav Yevgenyevich Alekseyev and the design bureau he 
established. 
  However, some newly formed organizations also claim a role 
in 
building surface skimmers. There has been much criticism of the 
TsKB [Central Design Bureau] for Ground Effect Vehicles imeni 
Alekseyev. This is why I made a quick trip to Nizhniy Novgorod. 
V. Sokolov, the chief designer for this field and for surface 
skimmer planning, explained it to me: 
  "No matter what is said, the TsKB for Surface Effect 
Vehicles 
is a huge organization possessing a design, experimental and 
production base, and it permits travel along the entire path 
from an idea to a plan's realization." 
  Yes, the TsKB endured difficult times in recent years. The 
work volume of military orders, which were the main source of 
work, was dramatically reduced, while financing for civilian 
construction of surface skimmers has not yet been found. 
  The TsKB drew up a federal program for development of 
civilian surface skimmer building, with the necessary 
feasibility study. 
  The regional association LIKO-Prommarket (general director, 
V. Litvinenko) was one of the first among commercial structures 
to become a dependable partner in joint efforts to design 
passenger surface skimmers based on the Orlenok plan. 
Considering the complexity of the problem's solution and the 
relatively high cost of the work, the TsKB and LIKO are hoping 
to attract other investors both in Russia and abroad. 
  The hope in Nizhniy Novgorod is that assets will also be 
allocated from the state budget, especially so as to ensure the 
needed life, reliability and certification of surface skimmers 
as a new form of transportation. This is unfortunately 
necessary. Why is it that today's commercial structures are not 
living badly, and that you could earn more working for them? 
Because they enjoy tax concessions, and their overhead is 
lower--no laboratories, no test benches. But despite everything 
the basic core of qualified designers has survived. Besides the 
TsKB, the commercial enterprises Amfikon (amphibious vehicles) 
and Transal (the Alekseyev transporter) are involved in the 
development of surface skimmers in Nizhniy Novgorod. But as 
foreign experience shows, the possibilities of small enterprises 
of this kind are extremely limited. 
  Three types of surface skimmers are distinguished. The first 
has a low wing aspect ratio--up to 1. These are known as craft 
employing the dynamic principle of support. They have only a 
rudder, and they possess (conditionally) two degrees of freedom, 
like a car or a small boat. They are driven by boat captains. 
Craft employing the dynamic principle of support include, for 
example, the Volga-2 passenger boat and the Raketa-2 gas 
turbo-vessel. 
  The second type is represented by surface skimmers with a 
wing aspect ratio of up to 3. They have three degrees of 
freedom, and they fly within the limits of surface effect. They 
are equipped with an elevator. This type of surface skimmers 
includes the KM, Strizh, Orlenok and Lun. 
  The third type is surface effect aircraft. When necessary, 
they can fly at high altitude like airplanes. These are still 
just plans and models. 
  Everything that could happen during testing has, including 
accidents and disasters. In all cases the commissions concluded 
that crew error was the main cause of the incident. During 
testing of the Orlenok its tail section disintegrated and broke 
off together with the sustainer engine. But the surface skimmer 
did not sink, and it was able to return to base on its own power 
using its starting engines. 
  The surface skimmers KM, Volga-2 and Raketa-2 were described 
earlier in the No 11, 1991 issue of KRYLYA RODINY. Other designs 
are presented below. 
  The small Strizh surface skimmer is a two-seat craft. It is 
intended for pilot training. It is capable of taking off and 
landing on a water and a snow surface. It may be used for 
patrolling, communications and business flights. V. Bulanov is 
the chief designer. 
  Length--11.4 m. Wingspan--6.6 m. Height--3.6 m. Takeoff 
weight--1,630 kg. Maximum speed--200 km/hr, cruising 
speed--175/hr. Takeoff run (water/snow)--600/400 m, landing 
run--350/300 m. Flying range with a passenger--500 km. Ferrying 
range--800 km. Flying altitude above surface--0.3-1.0 m. 
Navigability: Takeoff and landing at a wave state of up to 0.5 
m, capable of floating at a wave state of up to 1.3 m. Time of a 
training flight with one person aboard--3 hr, with two--1-2 hr. 
Engines--two rotary piston water-cooled VAZ-4133, 160 horsepower 
each. Fuel consumption--0.35 liters/km. The airframe is made 
from an aluminum-magnesium alloy. Structures are riveted 
together. The propellers are driven by a cardan shaft through a 
step-down one-step reduction gear and an automatic clutch. The 
propellers are five-bladed, 1.1 m in diameter, with fixed pitch. 
The engine nacelles are equipped with fire warning systems and 
electrically controlled fire extinguishing systems. 
  The Strizh is based on shore under an awning (or in a 
hangar) 
on a special truck that simultaneously serves during flying as 
the means of launching and raising the surface skimmer when a 
ramp descending to a water depth of not less than 1 meter with a 
slope of up to 6 degrees is present at the base. The surface 
skimmer is serviced by one mechanic. 
  The Orlenok seagoing surface skimmer was designed as an 
assault landing transporter for the navy, and it has been in 
operation since 1979 (chief designer, V. Sokolov). Basic data: 
Length--58 m. Wingspan--31.5 m. Height--16 m. Normal takeoff 
weight--125 tonnes. Overloaded takeoff weight (there is a limit 
on wave height during takeoff)--140 tonnes. Payload weight--up 
to 20 tonnes. Maximum fuel weight--28 tonnes. Cruising 
speed--350 km/hr. Range--1,100 km. Navigability: Takeoff and 
landing--up to 4 points, floating and flying--4-5 points. 
Amphibious capability: Emergence onto a relatively even shore 
with a slope of up to 5 degrees. Basing: Parked on special 
pontoon platforms or engineered shore platforms. Crew--nine 
persons. 
  The Orlenok surface skimmer is a cantilever monoplane 
consisting of a streamlined fuselage with the hydrodynamic 
elements locating in its lower part, low wings with a low aspect 
ratio, and an elaborate tail. The fuselage has a relatively 
simple beam-and-stringer structure, and it is divided in its 
layout into three sections--nose, middle and tail. 
  The nose section contains the crew cabin, starting engines 
and compartments housing the electronic equipment, including a 
radar station located in the nose tip and covered with a 
radiotransparent faring. Depending on the purpose of the surface 
skimmer the middle section of the fuselage may be designed as a 
passenger cabin or cargo bay, or it can be filled with special 
equipment. The tail section contains a compartment housing 
auxiliary engines and onboard machinery for starting the main 
engines and maintaining the performance of the surface skimmer's 
hydraulic and electric systems. 
  Fuel tank compartments are in the left and right wing 
panels. 
As with the fuselage, the wing as a whole is a sealed watertight 
structure imparting buoyancy to the surface skimmer. The 
necessary stability and unsinkability are achieved in this case 
by dividing the lower part of the fuselage and wings into 
watertight compartments. 
  The main propulsion unit consists of one sustainer turboprop 
NK-12MK engine and two starting turbofan NK-8-4K engines 
designed by N. D. Kuznetsov. The NK-12MK provides for economical 
cruising, and it is positioned on the surface skimmer's tail, at 
the intersection of the fin and stabilizer. This relatively high 
position of the engine is the result of the need for keeping it 
away from sea spray when the surface skimmer starts, lands and 
takes its landing run. It also reduces the possibility of salt 
contamination of the engine in flight by aerosols in the sea 
atmosphere, the saturation of which is known to depend on height 
above the surface. 
  The starting engines work only when the surface skimmer 
takes 
off, and they are outfitted with swiveling gas exhaust nozzles 
for changing the direction of the engine exhaust stream: During 
the takeoff run--beneath the wing to create an air cushion (blow 
mode), and during transition to cruising mode--horizontal 
thrust, accelerating the surface skimmer to cruising speed. As 
with the engines themselves, the air intakes of the starting 
engines are designed flush with the outline of the surface 
skimmer's nose section to reduce drag. 
  Blowing of the gas streams beneath the wings during the 
takeoff run helps to reduce hydrodynamic resistance and external 
hydrodynamic loads, which is especially important when the craft 
takes off over a rough sea. Blowing is also employed for these 
purposes when landing the surface skimmer in landing run modes. 
  The main systems of the surface skimmer--control, hydraulic, 
electric power supply, life support, radio engineering and 
navigation support--are designed as aircraft systems. Redundancy 
and backup of systems and equipment are foreseen, which is 
necessary for safe operation of the aircraft. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-56A>           Layout of the 150 Passenger Orlenok </FIG>




  Initial plans for seagoing surface skimmers intended for 
different purposes have been drawn up on the basis of the 
Orlenok at the TsKB for Surface Effect Vehicles. The seagoing 
passenger surface skimmer is intended for high-speed passenger 
conveyance over inland and marginal seas at a speed of 400 km/hr 
at a distance of not more than 2,000 from a port. The Lyuks 
variant carries 65-75 passengers; the single-deck variant 
carries 100-150; the double-deck variant carries up to 300 
persons. There is a crew of five. 
  The seagoing cargo surface skimmer is intended to convey 
express cargo. The weight of the cargo is 30 tonnes, and the 
dimensions of the cargo bay are 21x3.2x3.0 m. 
  The seagoing arctic geological exploratory surface skimmer 
is 
used for geological and geophysical operations in shallow shelf 
waters of the Arctic Seas, and for their transportation support. 
  The search-and-rescue surface skimmer is intended for 
search-and-rescue support to the seagoing fleet, for delivery of 
emergency rescue teams to places of accidents and natural 
disasters in the vicinity of offshore drilling rigs, to 
platforms, and to population centers on the coast, on the shelf 
and in island zones, and to provide assistance to and evacuate 
casualties and the public from these places. 
  The air-sea search-and-rescue system consists of the Mriya 
airplane and the Orlenok surface skimmer. It is intended for 
effective search and rescue of people from sunken or distressed 
vessels through the combination of high speed and long range. 
System takeoff weight--600 tonnes. System speed--800 km/hr. 
Carrier range--6,000 km. Surface skimmer speed--400 km/hr. 
Surface skimmer range--2,500 km. Navigability--4-5 points. 
Number of victims taken aboard the surface skimmer--up to 150 
persons. 
  There are great possibilities for an experimental 
search-and-rescue surface skimmer currently under construction, 
code-named the Spasitel (chief designer, V. Kryllovykh). Its 
detail design was completed in 1991. Construction of the surface 
skimmer proceeded simultaneously with this at an experimental 
plant. It is 70 percent assembled. It should have a speed of 450 
km/hr. Takeoff weight--400 tonnes. Capacity--up to 500 rescued 
persons. A hospital fitted out with surgical and resuscitation 
rooms and a casualty ward is foreseen. Had we possessed this 
surface skimmer sooner, we may have avoided the tragedy that 
befell the submarine "Komsomolets," in which 42 persons died. 
Unfortunately, conclusion of the construction of this unique 
rescue resource is in jeopardy. The main reason is a lack of 
financing by the client, a role played by the navy's 
search-and-rescue service. It would be a pity if this enormous 
amount of labor is wasted, and the unfinished surface skimmer is 
scrapped. But this is fully possible in our unpredictable times.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Aleksandrov: "Flat Antenna Improves </F>
Appearance"] 
  [Text] Western Europe has a problem, one which is somewhat 
humorous to us: Large numbers of satellite television receiving 
antennas are spoiling the view of residential and administrative 
buildings. American, European, and Japanese firms have attempted 
to resolve this problem by rendering the antenna flat and 
unnoticeable. Alas! The laws of physics relentlessly dictate a 
definite shape, such that antennas continue to assume the 
configuration to which we have become accustomed. 
  The above brief introduction should make it clear why the 
European press ("The Times," in particular), not the Russian, 
was the first to report the successes attained by domestic 
electronics specialists. It was the latter, if one is to believe 
that press, who were able to "trick" the laws of physics to 
create flat antennas of any configuration which can be easily 
"camouflaged" to blend with the color of a building. The 
newspaper accounts were marred by inaccuracies, lacked any 
mention of the sources of the information, and failed to name 
the manufacturer. Perhaps that was due to fear on the part of 
each country that her competing neighboring countries would be 
the first to get to Russia. Another reason could be that what 
was reported was nothing more than a false rumor. 
  Nonetheless, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondents did manage to 
obtain a confirmation in the Russian Ministry of Communications: 
"Yes, something like that was done in the Urals." They were 
provided an explanation of why the sensational invention was not 
reported by the domestic press: The antenna was made for 
military purposes; it is simpler to both transport and 
camouflage in a combat situation. 
  Although the Urals are a large area, a single telephone call 
to the editorial office of VECHERNYY CHELYABINSK was sufficient 
to "ferret out" the hero of the day: "Yes, it was done here in 
our city. There has been no need to advertise, since as yet 
there is nothing to sell." 
  "We lack the means to tool up for production of the 
antenna," 
was an admission made to the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent by 
Sergey Ponomarev, who experimented with flat miracle antennas 
over a long period of time in a laboratory of the Chelyabinsk 
NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Measurement Technology. 
The Institute had been contacted by specialists from the USA, 
Great Britain, Germany, and South Korea who wished to purchase 
the antenna or acquire patent rights with the intent of 
undertaking its manufacture. 
  Ponomarev proceeded to speak at length in glowing terms of 
the unavailable antenna, finally asking surprisingly: "When will 
it show up here in Russia? Well, round antennas do not harmonize 
with detached buildings in our country, also."

Providing Antiballistic Missile Defense in a TMO"] 
  [Text] Modern U.S. military strategy is based on the 
assumption that use of armed forces in regional conflicts is to 
become, now and in the immediate future, the most probable 
variant of protecting vitally important American interests. The 
spread of missile weapons into developing countries, the advent 
of a real possibility for their creation of mass destruction 
weapons, political instability in the former USSR, and 
difficulties in suppressing mobile missile systems (from combat 
experience in the Persian Gulf) are making it necessary to 
develop and deploy effective antiballistic missile (ABM) systems 
in theaters of military operations (TMOs) to protect friendly 
forces and objectives from strikes by operational-tactical and 
tactical ballistic missiles. A report to Congress by U.S. Armed 
Services Chairman of the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Colin L. Powell (February 1993) states that "equipped with 
chemical or biological warheads, the enemy's ballistic missiles 
can present a significant threat to our mobile forces, which are 
the principal forces in the USA's new regional strategy." 
  In accordance with the state's military strategy, the 
command 
of the U.S. Navy is activating efforts to create sea-based ABM 
systems. Three fundamental studies were carried there in 1991: 
"Requirements on Tactical ABM Systems in 2010" (U.S. Navy 
Consultative Committee for Scientific Research and Experimental 
Design Work"); "Tactical Sea-Based ABM Systems" (staff of the 
naval secretary's advisor on armament development and 
purchases); "Research on Antiballistic Missile Defense" 
(Scientific Council of the U.S. Department of Defense). 
  The following conclusions were reached on the basis of this 
research: 
  1. The threat of the use of ballistic missiles in a TMO is 
real, and continues to grow. More than 30 countries have 
operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles, and a 
large number of countries are aspiring to acquire them. 
Ballistic missiles already adopted could be upgraded with the 
purpose of increasing their combat effectiveness. Creation of 
warheads fitted with mass destruction weapons may be one of the 
routes of upgrading in this case. 
  2. Naval forces and resources can make a significant 
contribution to creating ABM systems in a TMO. The strategy of 
creating sea-based antimissile systems is based on factors 
inherent to the navy, such as accessibility to most regions, 
mobility, flexibility, and the capability for lengthy operation 
not only to protect the navy's most important facilities but 
also to defend mobile and expeditionary forces (assault forces), 
their landing ports, maritime airfields and cities, and other 
important facilities within their range. In addition such 
systems are capable of significantly increasing the 
effectiveness of regional ABM systems by providing support to 
ground-based antimissile systems. 
  It was noted that the modern Aegis ship automated weapon 
combat control system outfitted with Standard-2 surface-to-air 
guided missiles is capable of carrying out limited ABM missions. 
On the whole, its specifications and performance characteristics 
are not optimized for antimissile defense, but there is a 
possibility for upgrading them for these purposes. 
  The foreign press writes that the command of the U.S. Navy 
has drawn up a plan to create ship ABM systems in two phases. 
The first entails efforts to upgrade existing ship 
surface-to-air missile systems for ABM missions in the TMO, 
while the second entails development of future sea-based 
antimissile systems. The main elements of the plan for their 
creation were coordinated with the leadership of the SDI program. 
  The work of the first phase includes upgrading the Aegis 
system and the Standard-2 SAM. Changes in the system itself will 
be insignificant. The MK 99 Mod.2 fire control system and the 
MK-41 vertical launcher remain as before. Some changes are being 
made in the program and work algorithm of the AN/SPY-18 radar 
station, the control and decision making instrumentation, and 
the displays. The upgrade is most visible in the Standard-2 
missile, which is being fitted with a new warhead, an improved 
homing head and an improved fuze. The upgraded missile will have 
the greater killing power and speed to destroy 
operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles. 
  The work of upgrading the SAMs is being carried out by 
America's Raytheon, which has experience in similar work on the 
Patriot system, which was used to defeat Iraqi ballistic 
missiles during combat operations in the Persian Gulf. 
  The upgrade program was drawn up in such a way that flight 
tests of the block 4 Standard-2 SAM would begin upon completion 
of the work of improving the fuze and homing head and creating a 
new warhead, and that it would be finished in 1995. Ships are to 
be armed with an antiballistic missile capable of close 
interception of operational-tactical and tactical ballistic 
missiles in 1996. It is anticipated that as with the Patriot 
surface-to-air guided missile, the modernized block 4 Standard-2 
missile will be able to effectively hit both aerodynamic and 
ballistic targets. 
  The official point of view on the justifications of work in 
the first phase is based on the following premises: 

  -  the navy already has radar stations and vertical 
launchers, so all it needs is to develop antiballistic missiles, 
while the ground forces have to develop new radar stations, 
launchers and antiballistic missiles for the future ground-based 
THAAD ABM system; 
  -  naval ships are a mobile force, and they are 
capable of reaching regions of crisis rather quickly, while 
deployment of a ground-based ABM system in a TMO would require 
from 1 to 3 weeks; 
  -  sea-based ABM systems make it possible for 
the local command to use them more efficiently in crisis 
situations, for example in the first days of a conflict, while 
the naval ABM component in the TMO could afford protection to 
troop airlifts by providing cover against missile strikes to 
coastal airfields. 

    American specialists assert that a zonal ABM system would 
play the most important role in regions of crisis, because of 
the 37 potential trajectories of ballistic missiles with a range 
of around 1,000 km, 26 pass over the water surface. Therefore, 
presence of a ship carrying an ABM system at the need spot would 
allow it to destroy a ballistic missile in flight (Figure 1). 
Moreover, according to estimates of the same specialists, from 
50 to 60 percent of the most important cities and industrial 
centers in the Western Pacific may be protected by sea-based ABM 
systems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-59A>           Figure 1. Interception of an </FIG>




  American ships armed with ABM systems and located in the 
Mediterranean Sea could defend their bases in Europe from a 
missile attack from the African coast, particularly in the case 
of an attack on Italy by Libya, while ships deployed in the 
Persian Gulf could defeat ballistic missiles launched from 
countries in the Near East. 
  Development of the next generation of the Aegis ship 
automated weapon combat control system, with greater ballistic 
missile detection and tracking range, is planned in the second 
phase. 
  Both individual components of the ABM system (computers, 
radar stations, radar signal processors etc.) and the software 
will be subjected to upgrade. There are plans for developing an 
antiballistic missile capable of fighting operational-tactical 
and tactical ballistic missiles of the future with a range from 
hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers and equipped with 
different kinds of warheads, including nuclear, chemical and 
biological. The upgraded Standard-2 SAM and the THAAD 
antiballistic missile presently being developed for the ground 
forces (with a planned range of ballistic target destruction of 
up to 200 km, and an altitude of 150 km) could serve this role. 
  Concurrently there are plans for improving the control and 
data transmission system, which will be brought together into a 
unified system utilizing ground, air and space ballistic missile 
detection and tracking resources in order to raise the 
effectiveness of ABM systems. Around 25 percent of the planned 
appropriations for work to create ABM systems for TMOs in the 
1993-1999 fiscal years are being allocated to the navy. 
  In future upgrading of the Standard-2 SAM, a third Thiokol 
accelerating stage and the LEAP small homing hyperfast 
projectile, developed on a competitive basis by America's 
Boeing, Hughes and Rockwell International, are to be installed 
in it. 
  LEAP ammunition, which weighs around 10 kg, will be able to 
destroy operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles due 
to kinetic energy released upon striking the target. It is to be 
outfitted with an optical homing head, which will be used at 
altitudes above 70 km in order to exclude the harmful influence 
of atmospheric optic effects (distortions of the optical viewing 
axis, considerable heating etc.)(Figure 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-60A>           Figure 2. LEAP Small Homing Hyperfast </FIG>




  Work on LEAP technology for the Standard-2 missile was 
started in 1992. In that same year the first flight test was 
conducted with the purpose of demonstrating the missile's 
ability to deliver the LEAP projectile to an altitude above 90 
km. The testing was done in the Eastern Atlantic. A target 
rocket was launched from the eastern missile range at Cape 
Canaveral, Florida to a distance of 800 km. The tests showed 
that the Standard-2 SAM can deliver a mockup of the LEAP 
projectile to an altitude of 110 km, while together with an 
AN/SPY-1B radar station the Aegis system is capable persistently 
tracking a ballistic missile and guiding a SAM to a prescribed 
point. 
  During the next tests, planned for mid-1993, a Standard-2 is 
to be launched carrying a mockup of the LEAP projectile of 
actual size in order to work out the mechanism of its separation 
from the rocket. 
  The next three tests of the first series are planned for 
1994 
with the additional Thiokol third accelerating stage. The shock, 
vibration and thermal loads will be determined and the operation 
of the autopilot will be evaluated during these tests. The 
faring of the missile is to be jettisoned at an altitude of 80 
km and the third stage is to be started to accelerate the LEAP 
ammunition during the testing. The mockup of the LEAP ammunition 
is to separate from the accelerating stage 145 seconds after the 
missile's lift-off (at an altitude of 150 km); all components of 
the missile, including the accelerating stage, the LEAP 
ammunition and the work of the homing head will be checked. 
There are also plans for carrying out a real interception of a 
ballistic missile launched from Cape Canaveral to a distance of 
1,000 km over the Atlantic Ocean; the intercept will occur at an 
altitude of 100 km, 800 km from the launch site of the 
operational-tactical ballistic missile. The target rocket will 
have a speed of 2-3 km/sec. 
  After the first series of flight tests are evaluated, the 
navy will begin the second, which will include five real 
interceptions of ballistic missiles in 1995-1997. Concurrently, 
naval specialists will study the experience of associates from 
the ground forces in creating the THAAD ABM systems, and work 
out the problems, as necessary, of installing this system or its 
antimissiles aboard ships. 
  In the year 2000 the U.S. Navy plans to install ABM systems 
aboard 22 "Ticonderoga" class guided missile cruisers and 26 
"Berk" class guided missile destroyers. According to U.S. Naval 
specialists, sea-based ABM systems equipped with the Standard-2 
SAM carrying LEAP ammunition (Figure 3), deployed by the western 
and eastern shores of America, could be used to repel a limited 
nuclear missile strike against the USA. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-60B>           Figure 3. Standard-2 Sea-Based </FIG>




  In order to afford protection to Marine Corps units against 
missile strikes, the Improved Hawk SAM system with which they 
are armed is to be upgraded. This system contains an AN/TPS-51 
radar station capable of identifying ballistic targets and 
calculating the trajectory, the launch point and the warhead's 
point of impact. In addition, the radar station can detect small 
targets like cruise missiles. Data are transmitted automatically 
by communication lines from the radar station to Improved Hawk 
SAM system batteries. The range of detection is 740 km for 
ballistic targets and 550 for small targets. The radar station 
has a device for automatic determination of its coordinates, the 
same as the kind in SAM batteries. 
  Tests carried out at the White Sands Proving Grounds (New 
Mexico) in May 1991 confirmed the capability of the radar 
station for detecting and tracking ballistic missiles. During 
the tests it persistently tracked and transmitted information to 
the SAM system, which was located 120 km from the missile's 
launch site and 85 km from the SAM battery. There are plans for 
acquiring nine AN/TPS-59 radar stations for Improved Hawk 
missile systems possessed by the Marine Corps. 
  The war in the Persian Gulf confirmed the operational and 
strategic necessity of creating ABM systems in a TMO, including 
sea-based ones, to neutralize the threat from ballistic missiles 
in regional conflicts. The American plans for creating ABM 
systems in TMOs are acquiring an increasingly more integrated 
and definite nature. The timetable and directions of development 
of technology have been determined rather specifically. However, 
the possibility of further adjustment of the technical makeup of 
TMO ABM systems, including sea-based systems, is not excluded. 
The USA generally possesses sufficient financial, economic and 
technical possibilities for deploying such systems by planned 
deadlines.

and Anatoliy Stasovskiy, Sevastopol, under the rubric: 
"Military-Political Survey": "The Crimean Peninsula: Armed, But 
Is it That Dangerous?"] 
  [Text] The presidential elections in the Crimea are 
an accomplished fact. What is more, Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov has already managed to visit both Kiev and Moscow and to 
make quite a few ambiguous statements. It's not an exaggeration 
to say that each of his words have been heeded, first of all, 
because he spoke about the Crimea --"the peninsula of discord". 
The nature of the contradictions there have long ago exceeded 
the bounds of the diplomatic. It's no secret for anyone that 
there are men and equipment on the peninsula that are capable of 
resolving the dispute, alas, not only in words. And the 
"sortings out" of late are a sufficiently convincing 
confirmation of that. 
  Analysts warned that arms could start "talking" already 
during the course of the election campaign. 
  That was the kind of picture that was drawn. And 
although fortunately the gloomiest predictions were not 
realized, a potentially explosive situation remains on the 
peninsula. 
  The Crimea is becoming increasingly saturated with Ukrainian 
troops, weapons, and armed formations. The following facts 
attest to that. 
  A more than 650-man Ukrainian naval infantry battalion has 
been deployed near Sevastopol (that, as we know, is the Black 
Sea Fleet's primary naval base) near the village of Tylovoye. It 
has up to 40 BTR-70's [armored transport vehicles], 120-mm 
mortars, mount-type antitank grenade launchers, and portable 
surface-to-air missile systems in its inventory. Even though it 
is called a naval infantry battalion, this formation has an 
imaginary tie to the sea. No one is undergoing naval training 
here. In fact, it is not even being tasked with that mission. 
And the servicemen are first and foremost being trained based 
upon the spetsnaz [special forces] program. It is also 
remarkable that the battalion has been manned primarily with 
conscripts from Western Ukraine. Incidentally, these "naval 
infantrymen" have already displayed a curt disposition with 
regard to the local population on more than one occasion and 
have completely lived up to their sleeve emblems in the form of 
a gray predator-wolf. 
  A mechanized brigade is located in the area of Perevalnyy, 
northeast of the main Black Sea Fleet base. It consists of two 
mechanized infantry battalions, two tank battalions, and 
artillery, antitank and air defense battalions. The authorized 
strength is 1,800 men. But today there are actually 2,100 men. 
For comparison: The Black Sea Fleet naval infantry brigade, 
which recently appointed Ukrainian Navy Chief of Staff 
Rear-Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko called a "foreign formation", is 
actually much smaller in strength. 
  A full-fledged spetsnaz [special forces] brigade that is 
training saboteurs has been deployed in Staryy Krym [Old Crimea] 
(the western portion of the peninsula). It numbers approximately 
900 men. The brigade is organizationally part of the 32nd Army 
Corps which is currently commanded by Major-General Aleksandr 
Kuzmuk who came here from the Carpathian Military District. 
  A 350-man traffic control service battalion has been 
deployed 
within the city limits of Sevastopol itself. There are 
approximately 15 BTR's in its inventory. This battalion, like 
the one located in Tylovoye, is continuously growing and being 
augmented by equipment which, according to some data, is 
arriving from a storage base near Dzhankoy. 
  A patrol-postal service regiment is also deployed here. Its 
commander is Aleksandr Kostyukov. The regiment, just like yeast, 
literally grew from a recent battalion. Incidentally, the famous 
"Berkut" [golden eagle] subunit has also become a part of it. 
Right now it is small -- 15 men, but we anticipate that it will 
be brought up to a company strength of 60 troops. 
  A Ukrainian Armed Forces PVO [Air Defense] regiment with the 
well-equipped Belbek airfield is located to the north of 
Sevastopol. It can receive any aircraft, including reserved 
[liternyy] aircraft. The regiment itself has Su-27 
fighter-interceptors in its inventory. Incidentally, 
fully-graded emplacements were recently dug at Belbek. 
  It's possible that someone has undertaken to prove the need 
for these and other units and large formations on the peninsula. 
As we know, you can find the advisability in everything. Let's 
note only that in the recent past they planned to reduce the 
Ukrainian armed forces on the peninsula. Meanwhile, the strength 
of the Ukrainian Armed Forces formation has increased from 
15,000-18,000 to 51,000 men during the last 1-2 years. 
  It is curious that Ukrainian Minister of Defense General of 
the Army Vitaliy Radetskiy responded with the following to Yuriy 
Meshkov's statement on the initiation of demilitarization of the 
Crimea precisely from the withdrawal of Ukrainian units: He said 
that this issue is not within Meshkov's competence. Therefore, 
it seems the opposite reaction has also not been excluded -- not 
demilitarization but a further, drastic reinforcement of the 
Ukrainian troop formation in the Crimea. 
  One spark is sufficient to start this "mechanism". And it's 
good that the verbal attempts of Rukh [Popular Movement of the 
Ukraine] leaders (we must recall at least Aleksandr 
Lavrinovich's recent statement that the results of the elections 
are a step toward the initiation of a confrontation in the 
Crimea and in Ukraine), and that also the threats of certain 
representatives of official Kiev and the leaders of the Crimean 
Tatars' mejlis to begin the countdown toward a new cycle of 
tension have not been carried out. Predictions with regard to a 
nearly automatic annulment of the results of the presidential 
elections in the Republic of the Crimea by Leonid Kravchuk and 
also the shipment of a "punishing expedition of the Ukrainian 
Army" to the "disobedient" peninsula have also not been 
confirmed. The events of recent weeks in the Crimea have 
occurred under the banner of the widely known but somewhat 
differently interpreted sentence in reality: "Everything flows 
but nothing changes". 
  The experience of recent years, when the replacements of 
some 
political leaders by others or some reformers by others have 
introduced practically nothing, indicates that we have become 
accustomed to the replacement of the decorations in the 
"political theater" and that we can already relate quite calmly 
to them. That calm in the Crimea can, at first glance, appear to 
be strange. But political tension did not erupt immediately here 
once again for several reasons. 
  We think that one of the main ones is that this is an 
attempt 
of certain prestigious experts to prevent the possible 
development of the situation. It is clear, even to a 
devil-may-care person, that warnings about careless steps that 
could simply transform the Crimea into a "hot spot" similar to 
Karabakh would have to take effect. 
  One more reason is Kiev's unexpected reaction, for some 
people, to the events in the Crimea. It becomes quite 
understandable if you look intently at the internal problems of 
Ukraine itself. The Republic of Crimea's independence attempt is 
already not that original. If you recall, Donetsk Oblast was the 
first to set out on that path. And the principle of "don't shake 
up" is not the most appropriate with regard to people who are 
striving for a better life. It seems that they understood that 
in Kiev. Furthermore, there are also concerns that are somewhat 
more important than the Crimean presidency -- elections to the 
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Today the distribution is as follows: 
Here for the time being no one can provide guarantees that 
events will not follow the "Belarus scenario". The population of 
Ukraine is now judging its leaders based upon specific matters. 
And there aren't many of them... It is no accident that 
Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch said that if Yuriy 
Meshkov manages to do anything at all for the residents of the 
Crimea, he will "be green with envy of him". 
  A very important reason for the relative calm in the Crimea 
is the fact that the political activity of the residents of the 
Crimea, who invested the last, so to speak, political forces in 
the elections of their president, has "petered out". It's as if 
the peninsula's population has become frozen in anticipation, 
having dwelled for the time being on one, let's state it 
frankly, "delicate" question: Where do we go from here? 
  But meanwhile Meshkov himself, -- and we need to admit this 
-- has become involved, in the opinion of many people, in a 
hopeful political game with quite a deceptive economic result. 
At least his first steps on the political scene did not give 
trump cards to the radicals from both camps. The meeting in Kiev 
and the constructively conducted negotiations in Moscow open 
quite real prospects to the Crimea. And, if nothing interferes, 
the "unsettled peninsula" could become a unique bridge for the 
establishment of closer economic cooperation of the two states. 
Partial support on the Russian ruble is a more than obvious 
advantage for the people of Crimea themselves. 
  And the main aspect. We all know: Weapons are quiet where 
money "works" and where a mutual economic interest is being 
realized. 
  In a word, there aren't grounds to incite passions for no 
reason but still it is impossible not to state the obvious. The 
Ukrainian nationalistic wing that finally lost in the Crimea and 
part of the Crimean Tatars will hardly reconcile themselves to 
defeat and will stand in fierce opposition to the president. At 
a low level of general and political culture, it is quite 
probable that this confrontation will be far from constructive. 
This will certainly add to Yuriy Meshkov's problems since it 
will be easy to find inadequacies in his first steps, especially 
while considering the inheritance he received. We can predict 
with a slight margin of error that the opposition will throw 
"its" mass media into the struggle with Meshkov and will attempt 
to utilize its ties with Ukraine's supreme authorities. In a 
word, today the residents of Crimea should in no way succumb to 
euphoria. They must understand that rapid changes are simply 
impossible. 
  The hottest heads are still attempting to accelerate the 
process. Neither the methods nor the consequences are important. 
A blockaded Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet with their "oxygen 
cut off" in all directions will appear on the maps. Red and blue 
lines will appear -- the axes of someone's proposed strikes... 
  But nothing better will become of this for anyone. 
Therefore, 
the highest responsibility, thoughtfulness and care in making 
decisions and the ability to resort to compromises are required 
from the politicians and from the leaders of various levels, 
including of the military departments. We need to finally 
understand that we should in no way cut the Crimean knot. We 
need to patiently and painstakingly untie it.

<F P=106> [Article by Major-General Yevgeniy Korotchenko, candidate of </F>
military sciences and professor, and Colonel Nikolay Plotnikov, 
officer graduate student at the Military Academy of the General 
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, under "A 
Look at the Problem" rubric: "Information Is Also a Weapon: 
About What Must Not Be Forgotten in Working with Personnel"] 
  [Text] It is not without reason that the mass media are 
called the "fourth power." The resolution of political, 
economic, and defense tasks depends to a considerable extent 
upon the fullness of information and its objectivity and 
dependability. 
  As everyone knows, however, information can be used not just 
for creative purposes. It is no accident that in the 
military-political confrontation of states and in other kinds of 
foreign and domestic conflicts we are now seeing a tendency 
toward a shift in the center of gravity away from traditional 
methods of force and means of combat toward nontraditional 
methods, including information. Their impact is imperceptible 
and appears gradually. It is less burdensome economically and is 
not dangerous ecologically. But the main thing is that it is 
difficult to get rid of. More and more often they will turn 
openly to military force when all other available possibilities 
for influence are already exhausted or military actions will 
likely be brief and, as they say, certain of victory. A graphic 
example of this is the war in 1990-91 in the zone of the Persian 
Gulf. 
  Thus, today information and information technologies are 
becoming a real weapon. A weapon not just in a metaphoric sense 
but in a direct sense as well. Natural questions are: What is 
the objective of the information action, under what principle 
does it work, and what kinds of dangerous effects of information 
are there? 
  One of the basic targets of the influence of information is 
the consciousness and mind of man. Depending on the objectives 
being pursued, the scope of the actions, the nature and content 
of the tasks being resolved, and the forces and means being 
applied, these people may be specific persons (state and 
political leaders, employees of special services, military 
personnel, workers in law enforcement agencies, scientists, and 
members of political parties and movements) or particular social 
groups (workers, entrepreneurs, young people, housewives, etc.). 
But under the conditions when the system for the management of 
the state has been disrupted and a situation of public-political 
and socioeconomic instability has been created in the country or 
in a specific region, the entire population may be the target of 
its influence. 
  The basis of the information action is a specially selected 
or developed information put into circulation with the help of 
well-defined and above all psychological methods and means at 
the proper time by some state or other or particular political 
forces against a selected target. Especially great here is the 
role of negative information or disinformation. Let us remember 
how the bloody events began in one of the former Central Asian 
republics of the USSR. A rumor ("They slaughtered our people at 
the bazaar because of a glass of strawberries") falling on the 
still-smoldering embers of interethnic disagreements about 
purely routine matters provoked mass killings of completely 
innocent women, children, and old men and led to many thousands 
of refugees. 
  The events of recent years abroad and in our country show 
that a special role in the influence of information on the 
public consciousness belongs to television, above all, 
apparently, because it gives the viewers the illusion of 
participating in what is taking place on the screen. Moreover, 
we live under conditions in which the receipt of information 
from other official sources is made more difficult. A very 
dangerous phenomenon in this respect was the crisis in the 
newspaper and magazine business, the dramatic decline in the 
circulation of printed publications, and the worsening of their 
distribution. 
  Here, for example, is how television was used in the 
development of public opinion at the very beginning of the 
bloody events in Bosnia. On one of the days, the television 
companies of many countries showed the mortaring of peaceful 
inhabitants of Sarayevo--Muslims standing in line for bread. And 
it all happened live, as they say, as though those who filmed 
the chilling scenes were informed of the coming events in 
advance. And is it possbile that this is how it was? They 
blamed the Serbs for the crime. And many television viewers 
hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the place of the 
tragedy, not to mention the Muslims of Bosnia, certainly 
believed this. Later, however, UN workers were able to determine 
that in reality the bloody provocation was the work of Muslim 
militants who had selected their coreligionists as targets. But 
the deed, as they say, had already been done. 
  It is possible to present a great many such examples of 
falsification and manipulation of facts, including in the public 
mass media. 
  Television and radio are becoming the predominant means of 
information in the army as well. And if one takes into account 
the growing psychological tension in the society, the loss of 
moral guidelines and values by most of our citizens, and the 
uncertainty about tomorrow, then television--if its standards 
are set by commercial interests as is done here--can also become 
an agent for social degradation. The scenes of violence on the 
screen, the propaganda of profit by any means, the 
permissiveness and disdain for the law, the pornography, and the 
forgetting of the many centuries of Russian history hardly 
strengthened the moral foundations of the army. 
  The techniques for the introduction of negative information 
and disinformation into the consciousness of people are quite 
varied. They may conditionally be divided into obvious 
techniques, unconvincing methods, delayed perception, 
repetition, argued methods, and techniques for resolute 
conclusions. 
  Obvious techniques are those that do not require additional 
information for the understanding of the basic content of the 
material being disseminated. Assertions are one example. They 
represent firm statements presented as obvious facts not 
requiring proof. Here any complex situation may be simplified to 
the point where, let us say, the cause of all troubles 
(economic, political, military, etc.) becomes quite obvious. 
Thus, for example, the culprit in the economic crisis in a 
number of republics of the former USSR may be declared to be 
either persons of another nationality, so-called "migrants," or 
people with a different political orientation. And this, as 
everyone knows, was one of the reasons for the national-civil 
wars in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and Tajikistan.... 
  Unconvincing methods operate under the principle: "You can 
believe it or not, I do not vouch for its authenticity." 
Particularly outstanding among these methods are insinuations 
employed to establish or evoke in the target of the action 
doubts about particular ideas, social groups, or individual 
personalities with the purpose of producing a schism in the 
midst of the target group. This is usually done through 
allusions, half-truths, and allegories so that the target of the 
action will draw his own conclusions but in such a way that is 
necessary for the one disseminating the information. The themes 
of the insinuations may be political views, socioeconomic, 
national, and religious differences, the personal lives of 
undesirable representatives of the state and military 
leadership, power structures, leaders of political parties, and 
entrepreneurs, the sources of their income, and the like. 
  In the use of methods of delayed perception, the target of 
the action perceives the basic content of the information only 
after becoming familiar with secondary materials. The 
premeditated concealment of certain information until it is no 
longer of current interest may serve as an example here. 
  Methods of repetition make it possible, figuratively 
speaking, to "pound" information into the subconciousness of the 
individual, the destructive action of which may subsequently be 
initiated at the proper time with the help of some slogan, 
appeal, combination of words, or symbols. 
  Arguments used in a negative information action are 
presented 
as a reason explaining the behavior or thinking of the target of 
the action. In so doing, it is sufficient to set different 
accents, remove some "inconvenient" details, and make some 
selective passes and the same argument can have a different 
sound to it and accordingly and different effect. 
  In speaking of the negative information effect on the 
personnel of the army and navy, it is necessary to pay special 
attention to rumors. Let us see what rumors represent, what are 
the reasons for their formation, how they influence the 
attitudes, behavior, and life aims of the individual, and what 
measures can be taken to counteract them. 
  People who encounter something that they cannot 
understand--real or invented but, as they see it, 
important--always strive to get rid of mental tension and to 
obtain the information necessary for their social orientation 
and the organization of their behavior in any situation. If for 
some reason the official information system does not provide 
satisfactory explanations and remains silent or says too little 
about something, then the people begin to offer their own 
version. This gives rise to rumors that spread unbelievably 
quickly without being subject to practical control. In crisis 
situations, by the way, it has always been that because of the 
disruption of the work of official sources of information rumors 
become the main means of satisfying the society's need for 
information. In the contemporary information space, they are 
capable of becoming a kind of "fifth power" when they take over 
the mass consciousness. 
  Rumors reproduce themselves and are believed not so much 
because they appear to be true but because the correspond to the 
information and psychological needs of people who have not been 
satisfied with the necessary information through official 
sources. 
  In terms of their origin or source, rumors may be 
spontaneous, conditioned by the objective conditions of the 
existence of man (a difficult social and economic situation and 
state of the social consciousness and mass psychology), or 
deliberately fabricated and purposefully spread for specific 
purposes. 
  In accordance with the characteristics of information, 
rumors 
may be subdivided into four basic types: Absolutely unreliable; 
unreliable with elements of plausibility; plausible; and 
reliable with elements of implausibility. 
  In terms of the nature of the general emotional reaction 
that 
they produce, they are also subdivided into frightening rumors, 
so-called "wishful" and "hopeful" rumors" (during the years of 
World War II, for example, the propaganda agencies of Germany 
spread the rumor of a "new secret retaliatory weapon"), and 
aggressive rumors. The first kind of rumors usually expresses 
the foresight of some unpleasant events. Such rumors have a 
favorable psychological basis in an environment with the 
predominant moods of alarm, uncertainty, and fear and usually 
substantially block the people's realization of their official 
duties and disorganize their actions. Rumors of the second kind 
most often represent the attempt to present what is desired as 
real. If the desired goes contrary to reality, then there is 
also a sharp decline in the morale and psychological stability 
of people. And aggressive rumors upset the interrelationships of 
people, disrupt the established ties between them, and promote 
interethnic and interreligious hostility and hatred. 
  How can one counteract the destructive effect of rumors, 
including in the army environment? 
  The most effective means of preventing the rise and 
circulation of rumors, of course, is the timely, systematic, 
and, the main thing, objective informing of personnel about 
events, facts, and problems. The more convincing information is 
and the more adequate it is from the point of view of quantity, 
the less reason there is for the rise of different conjectures 
that put a negative stamp on developing or existing public 
opinion. 
  An important role in the prevention of rumors, especially 
under the conditions of an unstable military-political or 
socioeconomic situation, is played by meetings of managers of 
different levels with the mass audience (television and radio 
appeals, direct contacts, press conferences, briefings, etc.). 
It is precisely from such people that they expect the 
appropriate information in a complex situation. Such meetings 
must be regular regardless of how events develop. 
  But what should be done if the rumor has already appeared? 
How should one react to it--remain silent, which amounts to 
promoting its further circulation, or deny it, which indirectly 
also serves to spread it? To counteract rumors in an active way, 
practice shows that the very best thing to do is to put specific 
undeniable facts up against it. That is, one must strive to fill 
the lack of information at once. 
  Probably one ought to include in the category of important 
educational tasks the development of a culture in service 
personnel for the perception of information, so to speak. We 
will not forget that for many years our people were not educated 
in the spirit of excessive trust in any printed word and any 
statement made on television or radio. It is necessary to 
develop in them the ability to analyze information critically 
and a certain mental outlook, a culture of perception. It is 
necessary to teach people to orient themselves independently in 
the flow of information and to assess the degree of authority of 
some source or other and to develop in them a kind of immunity 
against clearly unprincipled information actions. 
  Of course one should not overestimate the role of the mass 
media and rumors in influencing the consciousness and mind of 
the individual. Here other factors also play a role. But nor 
should one underestimate the fact that the behavior and life 
attitudes of practically all of us is largely determined by the 
content of the information that we obtain from newspapers, 
journals, radio and television broadcasts, and direct 
interpersonal contact. All of this must be considered in daily 
work with personnel.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Army Reforms Proceeding </F>
According to Plan"] 
  [Text] Do the Army's reforms reflect reality? Are they 
headed in the proper direction? What has been accomplished so 
far and what is planned for the near future? These questions 
have no simple answers. The questions were addressed at a press 
conference held by the Information and Press Directorate, RF MO 
[Russian Federation Ministry of Defense]. Participating in the 
conference were Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief 
of the General Staff, RF Armed Forces; Lieutenant General G. 
Ivanov, chief, Military Construction and Reform, RF MO; 
Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief, GOMU [Main 
Organization-Mobilization Directorate], GSh [General Staff]; and 
representatives of other directorates of the General Staff and 
RF Ministry of Defense. 
  The press conference was held in response to a message 
entitled "Strengthening the Russian State" sent to the Federal 
Assembly by Russia's President. As reported, a part of the 
message deals with the analysis and evaluation of reforms in 
progress in the Army as well as the nature Russia's Armed Forces 
will assume in the future. 
  "The Armed Forces are presently undergoing a most difficult 
phase of their development," pointed out Colonel General 
Zhurbenko. "At the same time, we must carry out measures for 
creating the Russian Army and for withdrawing the troops from 
Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and the Baltic countries as 
well." 
  All the above factors cannot fail to affect to some degree 
or 
other the processes taking place in the Army. I believe that no 
other army in the world has had to deal with such large-scale 
and difficult tasks. And this in the short time since inception 
of the reforms. Construction of Russia's Armed Forces started on 
7 May 1992, when the President issued a decree calling for the 
creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. In the ensuing 
period, we have seen the formation of the Ministry of Defense; 
conduct of an analysis of the actual state of the Armed Forces; 
development and presidential approval of a concept of their 
construction; writing of directives governing combat and 
mobilizational readiness and operational-strategic planning; and 
preparation of a number of legislative acts dealing with 
military issues. 
  Nonetheless, as pointed out in the president's message, the 
tasks levied have been accomplished in the Armed Forces. The 
reforms are proceeding according to plan in the Armed Forces. 
And if they were backed up by the necessary financing, I believe 
that many problems would be resolved much more readily. 
  In conclusion, one more fact: Since 7 May 1992, the manpower 
of the Armed Forces has been reduced by 457,000 men.

  [Text] THE MILITARY BUDGET FOR 1993 was approved in the 
amount of 8.2 trillion rubles; of this amount R7.5 trillion 
should have gone directly to the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense. 
  But actually, according to a Defense Ministry estimate 6.5 
trillion were transferred by the Ministry of Finance in 1993. If 
we consider that the minimum amount needed by the Ministry of 
Defense was over R10 trillion, the Defense Ministry's needs for 
1993 were only 65 percent satisfied. 
  IN 1993 THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ACCOUNTS were credited 
with monetary resources from the sale of freed military property 
(besides arms and ammunition): In the domestic market--R6.5 
billion; in the foreign market--$6.4 million U.S. 
  One thousand six hundred apartments were acquired in 1993 on 
these proceeds. 
  THE RF LAW "ON THE STATUS OF SERVICEMEN", which foresees a 
number of benefits, guarantees and advantages for servicemen and 
for citizens discharged from military services and for their 
families, was enacted as of January 1993. However, some of the 
benefits and advantages foreseen by the legislation have not 
been enacted because the mechanism of their implementation has 
not yet been found at the government level. 
  They include: 

  -  supplementary transportation benefits; 
  -  payment of monetary 
compensation when going on leave; 
  -  property insurance for 
servicemen; 
  -  preferential loans for housing construction; 
  -  sale of 
apartments and individual dwellings to servicemen on 
advantageous terms; 
  -  discounts in paying for installation and use 
of apartment telephones, and other benefits. 

    MONEY WAS NOT ALLOCATED PROMPTLY, or in full volume, to 
finance capital and housing construction. The Russian Finance 
Ministry's debt was carried over from one month to the next. In 
January 1993 it was R8.3 billion. By the end of the year the 
Ministry of Finance was R147 billion behind in transferring the 
amount foreseen in the federal budget for capital construction 
by the RF Ministry of Defense. And when real growth of prices of 
construction materials is accounted for, the figure reaches R290 
billion. 
  Of the 61,700 apartments to be placed into operation with 
funds from the federal budget in 1993, only 50,000 apartments, 
or 81 percent of the plan, were made available. 
  Allocation of R658 billion to housing construction and to 
the 
purchase of apartments was planned in 1993 (this is not counting 
outlays on construction of cultural and personal service 
facilities). That would have been 63 percent of the total 
allocations for housing construction by the Ministry of Defense 
in 1993. The actual amount transferred was R565 billion. 
  ACCORDING TO DEFENSE MINISTER P. GRACHEV the overall 
numerical strength of the RF Army as of 1 December 1993 was 
2,341,000 persons.

                        billion 

Note: The table gives expenditures only on position and rank pay of servicemen. 
Prepared by R. Bykov 


  THE MINIMUM PAY (1994) of contracting servicemen (privates, 
first rate classification) is over R110,000, the lowest 
classification (a ship petty officer aboard a submarine receives 
five times more). There are also a large number of significant 
benefits and extra payments, such that the total expenditures 
for contracting servicemen will exceed the figures presented in 
the tables by three or four times -- several trillion per year. 
  LAST YEAR THE PAY AND ALLOWANCES of servicemen were indexed 
three times -- as of January, April and September. This year 
they were indexed as of 1 January. Because of the complex 
economic situation in the country the RF Government decided on 
several occasions to index the pay and allowances of servicemen 
1-2 months late. This brought on complaints by many servicemen 
to different levels of authority regarding violation of Article 
12 of the RF Law "On the Status of Servicemen." 
  Thus, the minimum wage was increased by 1.81 times as of 1 
July 1993, while the pay and allowances of servicemen were not 
indexed until 1 September 1993 -- that is, 2 months later. 
  The present minimum wage -- R14,620 per month as opposed to 
R7,740 (a 1.9-time increase) -- was established as of 1 December 
by a presidential edict dated 5 December 1993, while pay and 
allowances of servicemen were indexed only as of 1 January of 
this year; that is, a month later.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "General Tragedy: Russia </F>
Threatened From the West Once Again"] 
  [Text] A new disaster threatens Russia in the very near 
future -- general unemployment. Withdrawal of forces from 
Eastern Europe will be concluded in August of this year, and a 
large number of highly placed military officials will have to 
find positions for themselves in Russia. 
  The huge Western grouping numbers 600,000 persons. The 
position of the commander-in-chief of the Western Group of 
Forces corresponded to the rank of a general of the army, and 
naturally Colonel-General Burlakov, who presently occupies it, 
and his deputies are not counting on a demotion when they 
transfer to Russia. There are many personal friends of Pavel 
Grachev among them. It would be sufficient to name that same 
General Burlakov, who gave the keys to a new Mercedes as a 
wedding present to Grachev's son and the daughter of General 
Kharchenko. Now Burlakov is on track for a job as chief of 
General Staff or, at the worst, commander of the Moscow Military 
District. 
  Grachev himself has long been endeavoring to clean up the 
generals' Olympus. In the fall of last year he announced to a 
small government circle that he intended to dismiss six of his 
close associates -- generals Mironov, Kuznetsov, Deynekin, 
Semenov, and even the Afghanistan veteran Gromov. Then, however, 
no one really understood what Grachev was intending. 
Nonetheless, he is gradually freeing the prestigious fifth floor 
of the Defense Ministry building; the telephones of his 
deputies, generals Mironov and Toporov, are no longer being 
answered. Grachev unleashed a main military "inspection" upon 
the command of the Moscow Military District -- to seek 
shortcomings. When on 4 February, during an official visit to 
the Taman Division the vehicle carrying the Russian and French 
defense ministers collided with a truck, Grachev rather bluntly 
promised to deal with the present commander of the Moscow 
Military District, Leontiy Kuznetsov. 
  A report that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov 
submitted his retirement papers fits into that same operatic 
scenario. The Information and Press Directorate of the RF 
Ministry of Defense denied this, and General Kolesnikov himself 
directly declared: "Our door is open, we are always ready for 
frank, constructive discussion. We made no secrets of our plans 
or of the status of the armed forces, and are making no secrets 
of our work." 
  The "Western" generals enjoy a great advantage. These are 
rich people by our yardsticks. The average wage of Russian 
generals in Germany is 1,200-1,500 marks, at the same time that 
a respectable automobile could be acquired there for a couple of 
hundred, or even for free, if the vehicle fails to meet 
ecological standards and is destined to be scrapped. 
  Service in the Western Group of Forces was considered to be 
a 
privilege in the army. In former times, officers were sent there 
after serving in a hot spot on the basis of a direct order from 
Grachev. However, this order was not followed completely. 
General Burlakov had never been in any hot spots. 
  The massive influx of generals from the West threatens to 
ruin the Russian Army's administration. New jobs are hastily 
being created. Pavel Grachev voiced the idea of resurrecting the 
operational sectors that used to stand over the districts and 
were abolished under Marshal Yazov. This idea would make sense 
if everything wasn't being done for the sake of creating jobs. 
Such a chair could also be fabricated out of mobile forces 
quickly slapped together to accommodate someone's rear end. As a 
result of restructuring the administration, the Moscow Military 
District risks being left without communications: The central 
signal brigade is being taken away from the district and placed 
into the composition of mobile forces. It will take time and 
money to set up a new brigade. 
  Russia has found itself with too many generals. Awarding 
general ranks before referendums has become a real tradition. In 
April, 187 persons received the big stars. Around another dozen 
did so before the December elections. As a result, the annual 
production volume of generals quintupled in comparison with the 
Soviet period. 
  The last reduction in general staff was carried out by 
Marshal Yazov in 1989. At that time, under public pressure, the 
central administration of the ministry shrank substantially 
(especially the Main Political Directorate), and in the words of 
deceased Marshal Akhromeyev, the Union was left with 1,700 
generals. Now the ministry has recovered -- never before had the 
defense minister had so many deputies. 
  Pavel Grachev is to set off for Germany on 13 March, after 
which he will probably turn in his suggestions to Yeltsin 
regarding appointments of generals of the Western Group of 
Forces. The generals are making ready to move. Many already have 
apartments here in Russia. The situation is complicated by the 
fact that withdrawal of the troops from the Baltics is also 
coming to its conclusion simultaneously. 
  General unemployment may become a fatal blow to the country. 
These aren't miners accustomed to living in barracks. Even 
before the first light of day, black Volgas surround the 
fashionable multistory buildings on Rublevskiy Highway. Generals 
of different ranks -- one, two, three stars -- come out of their 
homes and board their transportation together with their wives 
and children. 
  Personal use of official transportation has become the 
scourge of the Russian Army. Generals use it to drive to and 
from work and to vacation homes, and to drive their families 
here and there. Those who are not entitled to a Volga by their 
position (as an example, an automobile is provided in the Moscow 
Military District only to two persons -- the commander and the 
chief of staff) make use of transportation allocated to the 
needs of an entire directorate or department. 
  Officers working for such a department naturally never see 
the vehicle, and as they carry out their operational 
assignments, they curse the whole world for having to ride the 
crowded metro. A list of motor vehicles our correspondents 
discovered at the homes of generals on Rublevskiy Highway is 
published below. We ask the General Procurator to verify that 
the vehicles are being used in compliance with Defense Ministry 
Order No 22, Order No 60 (a secret order listing the persons 
using transportation) and Government Decree No 1159. 
  87-93 MMZ, 59-22 MMG, 24-29 MMZh, 42-80 MMZh (a pickup), 
04-44 MOK, 36-63 SP, 00-85 MMA, 04-64 MZ (a UAZ), 2257 MMZh,

<F P=106> [Article: "To Each His Own Invincible"] </F>
  [Text] On 23 February 1994 the Soviet Army would have 
celebrated its 76th anniversary, had it survived. But the 
Belovezhskiye agreements closed the book on its history. 
Sovereign units of the former Soviet Army are not simply living 
separate lives; they are also confronting one another. Quite 
likely, those who just a couple of years ago would have been 
called up into the same army might now be looking at each other 
across a front line -- in Azerbaijan, Ingushetia and the Dnestr 
region. The question of invincibility will be answered 
differently in the history textbooks of each nation. Still, the 
army will always remain legendary. It is an army that was feared 
by the entire world -- an army with Halhin-Gol and the Great 
Patriotic War, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Tbilisi 
and Baku in 1989, and Vilnius in 1991 behind its back. To some, 
this is the stuff of a heroic legend, while to others it is 
horrifying. But no matter what the official name of this day 
brings to the minds of what used to be the Soviet people, 23 
February will remain a holiday of the Soviet Army. It will 
remain so for all who served in it, and who waited for their 
soldiers to return from the front or from compulsory service.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Yadykin: "Afghan Veterans Union Marks Fifth </F>
Anniversary"] 
  [Text] Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of 
the founding of the Afghan Veterans Union (AVU). It was created 
on March 13, 1989, one month after the withdrawal of our forces 
from Afghanistan. 
  Today the AVU is a very large organization that brings 
together not only Afghan war veterans but also veterans of other 
local conflicts. The union operates in all the ex-Soviet 
republics (unofficially in Estonia). It has more than 1,200 
primary organizations and 287 regional and 15 republic divisions 
with a total of 350,000 members. 
  The AVU engages in extensive charity work to provide 
assistance to disabled Afghan veterans and to the families of 
fallen comrades. It has currently spent more than $500,000 to 
buy wheelchairs abroad. Two years ago the union began providing 
financial assistance to the families of fallen comrades in 
amounts of 100,000 to 300,000 rubles. Almost 3,000 production 
and commercial enterprises currently operate under the union's 
aegis. To mark its fifth anniversary the AVU has organized a new 
charity operation for which it has allocated more than two 
billion rubles.

<F P=106> [Northwest Border District Commander Vladimir Isayevich </F>
Vyunov and Northwest Cossack District Ataman Boris 
Aleksandrovich Almazov discuss Cossack border outposts: 
"Dialogues on the Border: `Lyubo' Cossack Outpost"] 
  [Text] 
At an outpost, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Isayevich 
Vyunov, commander of the Northwest Border District, and Boris 
Aleksandrovich Almazov, ataman of the Northwest District of the 
Russian Cossacks Union, held an in-depth discussion on the 
current state of the Russian Cossack movement, the outlook for 
Cossack service in general, and the creation of Cossack border 
units. 
  [Vyunov] I have been to many outposts during my military 
career, but this is my first visit to a Cossack outpost, and one 
called "Lyubo" at that (he laughs). But we are military men, so 
let's get right down to business. If you don't have any 
objections, Boris Aleksandrovich, I will begin with a question. 
The Russian defense minister and the commander in chief of the 
Border Troops, in accordance with a Russian presidential edict, 
have drawn up a list of units and subunits that, beginning this 
spring, will be manned primarily by Cossacks. In addition, we 
now know the results of the experiment in creating army 
formations in areas where Cossacks have traditionally lived, 
such as the Transbaykal region and the country's south. Our 
northwest region has certain special features. There are no 
Cossack settlements here, am I correct? Aren't we in danger of 
failing the attempt to create and man Cossack formations, Boris 
Aleksandrovich? 
  [Almazov] Vladimir Isayevich, such concerns are unnecessary. 
Let me begin by saying that there is no shortage of young and 
old ethnic Cossacks in our region. There are tens of thousands 
of them here on the territory of the five oblasts and Karelia. 
That the region has no areas in which Cossacks are densely 
concentrated, with the exception of St. Petersburg itself, is 
another matter. There is no question that it is harder for us to 
revive the Cossack traditions and way of life here than in areas 
where there are Cossack associations and where Cossacks populate 
entire villages to this day. But I don't think one should 
dramatize the situation. 
  The Russian President has issued an edict on state support 
for the Cossack movement, and we intend to implement it. For 
example, the Cossack Administrative Commission that I head (the 
Commission is a part of the St. Petersburg city administration), 
in conjunction with the City Military Commissariat, has devised 
a procedure for registering Cossacks who live in the city. Since 
serving in Cossack units is a purely voluntary affair, we 
decided that conscripts and reservists, on reporting to a 
Military Commissariat, have to declare that they are Cossacks 
and state that they would like to serve in the Cossack subunits 
now being set up. Accordingly, Military Commissariat officials 
are required to make a notation in the conscript's or 
reservist's documents. Then the Military Commissariats, working 
with the city administration's Cossack office, decide his fatec 
-- whether to send him to a Cossack unit or not. We hope that 
after this selection process the troop and border units will, in 
terms of their training and morale, soon make themselves known 
as the cream of the crop in the Russian Army and its Border 
Troops. 
  [Vyunov] Well, God willing, as they say. But we border 
troops 
also have another interest when it comes to the Cossack 
movement. I have had occasion to review the draft charter of the 
Russian Cossack movement. It says that only a Russian citizen 
who, on completing his compulsory or contractual service like 
everyone else, registers as a member of a Cossack village 
community, takes an oath, and begins Cossack irregular service 
will be considered a Cossack. As we know, that service differs 
from traditional army service in that a Cossack has his own 
parcel of land, private farm, or other equivalent farm. It would 
be good if a Cossack and his family, after completing his 
service at a border post, for example, could receive such a 
parcel near the state border. For us it would be very important 
to thus acquire a second line of border defense. This is because 
our current border zone is at best made up of neglected villages 
or unpopulated altogether. It is very difficult to serve under 
these conditions. 
  [Almazov] I wholeheartedly support your proposal. That is 
precisely how we see the continuation of Cossack service upon 
the completion of compulsory or contractual service in army or 
border units. The draft charter stipulates that Cossacks who 
live near the border are responsible for defending it. They must 
have the right, if required by the situation, to detain 
intruders and to turn them over to the Border Troops. For 
Cossacks performing irregular border service are militarily 
subordinate to the border district and under the civil 
jurisdiction of the ataman board of his Cossack community. But 
to make this possible, the state and the Border Troops command 
must provide Cossacks with weapons, equipment, and ammunition 
and grant them certain rights in addition to their 
responsibilities. 
  [Vyunov] I agree. And this is why it is essential to lay a 
legislative foundation for all this as soon as possible. I don't 
think the technical and organizational side of the matter is 
going to pose any special difficulty for us. We are prepared to 
hold training sessions with such contingents and to help them 
maintain equipment. And that's not all, we'll also help Cossacks 
bring in their harvests. Again, I think this will benefit both 
sides. For example, why should Cossacks have to haul their 
products hundreds of kilometers away to a city when we ourselves 
can buy them for our border outpost personnel and the families 
of officers and people serving under contract? 
  [Almazov] As regards the legislative foundation, you 
yourself 
know how hard it was just to push through the presidential edict 
on state support for the Cossack movement. But even after taking 
effect, it does not solve all our problems. There has to be 
clear-cut regulation of relations between regional 
administrations and Cossack missions at the local level. And it 
is especially important to achieve this in border regions. We 
and the Border Troops command must work together to uphold 
Cossacks' right of priority with respect to settling in border 
areas. These days, with people in the ex-Soviet republics 
leaving their familiar spots (and there are many Cossacks among 
them), it will not be very hard to do this. And let's not rule 
out the possibility of creating such settlements among our 
regional Cossacks as well. 
  Not very long ago I read in a newspaper that Cossacks are 
already prepared to try on green caps. I think they look good in 
the caps, and not just green ones. We will like all border 
service. After all, the Cossacks have safeguarded Russia's 
borders since olden times. And we are prepared to rear our young 
generation, your young people, military personnel, and new 
recruits in this spirit. 
  [Vyunov] That's great! Let's create a working group to 
coordinate efforts to enlist Cossacks for border service and to 
create Cossack settlements along the borders. And in order to 
ensure that this work continues, I think that we have to look to 
not only Cossacks of conscription age but also adolescents. 
Incidentally, you yourself have this in mind. Let's go about 
this in such a way that a brother goes to an outpost to relieve 
a brother. You select the kids, and we'll help you organize 
study groups and young border guard clubs. We'll work together 
to set up training camps during summer vacation that will be 
sure to capture the youngsters' imagination with the romanticism 
of serving on the border. 
  [Almazov] Great! We don't need to put any of this off. We 
have a lot of work to do in the time that remains until the 
spring conscription. Most importantly, we need to carry out our 
first conscription in a very organized fashion. This will be the 
starting point for the establishment of Cossack border service 
in our region. Right? 
  It's not enough to say that we are Cossacks, we have to 
prove 
in deed that, like our forefathers, we remain faithful to our 
main calling in life -- to serve the Fatherland wholeheartedly! 
And that's what we will do!

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Pelts: "The Army Is Performing Its </F>
Tasks Despite All the Complications and Problems"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Minister of Defense of the Russian 
Federation General of the Army Pavel Grachev held his regular 
press hour for Russian and foreign journalists. At the beginning 
of the conversation, in accordance with established tradition, 
he informed the journalists about what has happened in the Armed 
Forces of Russia since the last meeting. Let us remember that it 
took place at the end of December 1993. 
  First of all, the Minister stressed that a reform process 
has 
continued in the forces in accordance with the plans and tasks 
that are included in the president's message to the Federal 
Assembly. Planned measures were taken to improve the 
administrative system, to establish new force groupings and 
naval forces, to improve the system to bring the army and navy 
up to strength, and to provide them with the necessary equipment 
and armament. The defense minister singled out several of the 
most important directions in the reform of the armed forces. 
Above all, he stressed, the improvement of the system of 
military legislation was continued. The Ministry of Defense has 
already prepared more than 20 bills and they are preparing bills 
for new laws "On the Military Status" and "On the Military 
Police." 
  Other measures in the reform of the Armed Forces were also 
also being carried out strictly according to plan. One of the 
important problems continues to be that of the reduction of the 
numerical strength of the troops and forces. The Minister of 
Defense stressed that after a comprehensive analysis the 
decision was made to propose confirming a strength level of 1.9 
million men. It is thought that the lower level that was 
proposed earlier is simply unacceptable. 
  At the beginning of the year, it was also possible to 
reverse 
such a negative trend as the nonfulfillment of the plan for 
conscription. As of today, 88 percent of those drafted (from the 
existing plan) are fulfilling their constitutional duties in the 
ranks of the army and navy. It is proposed that the induction 
level be increased to 95 percent by the end of March. 
  A significant improvement was also noted in the state of 
military discipline. The total number of crimes and violations 
has been reduced by one-quarter in comparison with 1993. 
Nonstatutory relations decreased by more than 22 percent and 
cases of evasion of military service by 20 percent. Overall, the 
defense minister stressed, the nature of the violations in the 
army and navy reflects the situation in society. 
  The Minister of Defense expressed his greatest concern in 
connection with the formation of the military budget and the 
financing of the Armed Forces. He said that if the negative 
tendencies continue and no fundamental and decisive measures are 
taken in the near future, then it will be impossible to speak 
not only of the further reforming of the army but also of the 
security of Russia as a whole. Presently, the Ministry of 
Finance is proposing less than 50 percent of what is required 
for the needs and normal functioning of the army and navy. 
Naturally, such a situation is unsatisfactory. The Minister of 
Defense emphasized that he will continue to seek the budget 
necessary for the armed forces. He noted that even under these 
circumstances there are possibilities for additional financing 
of the forces, above all in connection with the right of the 
Ministry of Defense itself to determine quantities and to sell 
combat equipment, with the sale of surplus military property to 
the national economy, the reduction of orders from the military 
military-industrial complex, and the further reduction of the 
armed forces. Of course, the existence of this plan does not 
mean that the reform of the Army and Navy will proceed precisely 
in these directions. The minister of defense stressed that we 
will not permit a devastating reduction of the army, since this 
is disadvantageous for the state and in general. Furthermore, 
the Defense Minister emphasized that, as before, the established 
military budget will have a clearly expressed social 
orientation. It is proposed that more than 50 percent of all the 
budgetary funds allocated for the Ministry of Defense be 
directed to the social protection of service personnel. 
  In the course of the press conference, Minister of Defense 
Pavel Grachev answered many questions involving the problems of 
military cooperation with the countries of the far as well as 
the near abroad. In particular, he noted the good prospects for 
cooperation with France, the United States, the FRG, and also 
with Belarus, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and other 
countries of the Commonwealth. Commenting on the latest events 
that took place with respect to the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel 
Grachev stressed that the present problems must not influence 
the unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements, and 
that despite certain difficulties, he hopes for the close 
cooperation of the minister of defense of Ukraine. 
  Just as in past meetings with journalists, there were also 
questions of a political nature. In particular, the Minister of 
Defense was asked whether his presence in Moscow at this time 
has to do with the need for a "strong hand" in the capital. 
Pavel Grachev categorically rejected the political nature of the 
question and emphasized that the army was busy resolving its own 
problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with PVO Troops Main Staff Chief Colonel-General </F>
Viktor Pavlovich Sinitsyn by VESTNIK PVO editor-in-chief Colonel 
Mikhail Zakharchuk under the rubric "The Second Year of the Army 
of Russia": "The Computer As Assistant in Battle"] 
  [Text] Staff officers must also be trained in 
heuristic activity, and the intellectual support of staff 
operations must be provided for, in order for the Air-Defense 
Troops [PVO] to be able to fulfill their tasks in a quality 
fashion at the necessary contemporary level. These and other 
questions were touched on in the discussion of the 
editor-in-chief of the journal VESTNIK PVO, Colonel Mikhail 
Zakharchuk, with PVO Troops Main Staff Chief Colonel-General 
Viktor Sinitsyn. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] Viktor Pavlovich, the problems that we will 
touch on today are not new ones for our Air-Defense Troops. The 
incorporation of electronic gear, automated systems and means of 
command and control into combat and training processes has been 
underway for years now, if not decades. I will nonetheless be so 
bold as to assert that they have taken on particular urgency 
lately, literally during the period of emergence of the army of 
Russia. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] That is indeed so. Recent events in the 
country and the armed forces, in which you and I are living 
participants, have become so dynamic that we will not be able to 
handle them, to master them, based only on our past experience. 
We need a qualitatively new augmentation of our knowledge and 
skills. Whence the necessity of increasing the role of 
intellectual support for the work of the staff, on which I, by 
the way, would like to place the principal focus of our 
discussion. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] I understand that your terminology is clear 
to specialists. But they are not the only ones who read your 
journal. So let us first orient ourselves with respect to 
definitions, at least those that are advanced during our 
conversation. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] I have no objection. And I will start with 
the fact, for example, that the term "intellectual support for 
staff operations" is currently becoming more and more 
widespread, as is the modern interpretation of the existing 
concept of "automating staff processes based on the use of 
computer technology (EVT)." This is evidently conditioned by the 
fact that the processes into which computer gear is being 
incorporated are of an intellectual nature as a whole, since 
they permit a quantitative evaluation of logically substantiated 
variations of enemy actions, alternative variations for the 
operations of one's own troops and a determination of the 
optimal ones, and the receipt of unexpected results according to 
the results of multivariable modeling. The phrase "intellectual 
support" signifies that the main role in the process of making 
(or clarifying) decisions remains with the person, while the 
information and computational systems (IRS) -- the intellectual 
basis of which are mathematical models (MM) and information and 
computational tasks (IZ and RZ)--are just a tool for staff 
officers. 
  As for the heuristic activity of officers in the process of 
operational and combat training, here we have in mind the 
aggregate of logical techniques and methodological rules for 
theoretical research and seeking out the truth or the simplest 
method of training that facilitates resourcefulness and 
activeness in the person. The term, in other words, is not 
imbued with any outside connotation. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] So let us please return to where we started 
-- raising the role of intellectual support for staff operations. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] It is conditioned by the sharp increase in 
the number of uncertainties that most be dealt with in order to 
make the necessary decisions, the acute lack of time assigned to 
substantiating the plans for combat operations, and the optimal 
variations for the combat application of various types of 
manpower and equipment. 
  The experience of wars and conflicts of recent years 
testifies convincingly that modern combat operations are 
characterized by great rapidity, intensity and dynamism, and 
consequently an acute shortage of time to make or clarify 
decisions. The process of decision-making is becoming more and 
more difficult, crucial and collective under those conditions. 
  More crucial because losses, both human and of material 
resources, could prove to be catastrophic and lead to the 
complete loss of the fighting ability of troops in the face of 
the increased firepower of modern weapons systems and equipment, 
as occurred in the Persian Gulf. 
  More collective because under conditions of an acute 
shortage 
of time, commanding officers at all levels encounter a host of 
uncertainties that it is becoming impossible for one person to 
deal with, even with a high level of professional training and 
intellectual potentialities, without the aid of professional 
experts and advisors, a large portion of whom are concentrated 
on the staffs. It must be understood in this regard, when 
speaking of decision-making, that it (the decision) is a result 
of the activity of a system created for that purpose, in which 
some evaluate the alternative variations of the actions of the 
opposing sides (the staffs), while others (the commanding 
officers at all levels), agreeing with a proposed variation and 
approving it, assume responsibility for the consequences of 
decision-making, relying on collective reason. 
  More difficult because the scarcity of time allotted for 
obtaining, processing, analyzing and evaluating an enormous 
quantity of information, on the one hand, and the enormous 
responsibility -- which in some cases becomes nationwide or 
universal in nature -- on the other, condition the necessity of 
the mandatory performance of multivariable modeling of the 
confrontation of SVN [offensive air weapons] and PVO, with the 
aim of increasing reliability and reducing erroneous decisions 
to a minimum. It is also more difficult because staff officers, 
in a collective search for the optimal solution to a specific 
task (heuristic activity), run up against a shortage of initial 
information and a host of uncertainties. 
  A scarcity of information and a number of uncertainties 
exist, in particular, at the stage of evaluating the enemy, 
making it more difficult to deal with the possible intent of his 
actions (targets, amount and sequence of missions being carried 
out, sectors of the main and other thrusts, composition of 
forces and equipment employed, and determination of the force of 
the strike by sectors, as well as in the accomplishment of 
specific tasks -- the operational disposition of forces in 
echelon or a massed strike, the expected duration of SVN 
operations and the like). 
  At the same time, without having determined with a certain 
degree of reliability the intentions of enemy actions, it is 
impossible to evaluate the potential capabilities of the 
existing PVO system (subsystems for reconnaissance, command and 
control, fighter, aircraft and surface-to-air missile cover, and 
all types of operational, rear and technical support). The 
presence of uncertainties in evaluating the enemy obviously 
engenders uncertainty in the evaluation of one's own troops and 
the choice of variations for combat operations, and ultimately 
has an effect on the reliability and objectivity (quality) of 
the decisions being made (or clarified). 
  [M. Zakharchuk] The conclusion could be drawn from what you 
have said that an objective necessity has appeared on the agenda 
today of having a unified system of mathematical models and 
computational tasks, allowing officers not only to deal with the 
uncertainties you have mentioned in a short period of time, but 
also to suggest to them the optimal variations of solutions for 
combat operations, for the restoration of a destroyed PVO 
system, and for the resolution of other issues that arise in the 
dynamic combat environment. But how should a system of 
mathematical models (MM) and computational tasks (RZ) look? Or 
rather, to what requirements must they conform? 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] The functional essence of the system can be 
summarized according to the following parameters, without going 
into the details of it. 
  First, optimized models and computational tasks 
"suggesting" the best variation for a solution out of some 
quantity of possible ones should constitute the foundation of 
the system. A large portion of the existing MMs and RZs do not 
conform to this requirement, since they are in essence 
informational-computational. 
  Second, the MMs and RZs in the system should 
reflect more accurately the physical sense and specific nature 
of the confrontation of PVO Troops with the forces of an 
airborne attack. 
  One shortcoming of the existing MMs and RZs is the fact that 
unilateral combat operations, in which the enemy is relegated to 
the role of an abstractly standardized target, is inherent in 
them. The specific nature of the confrontation of PVO Troops 
with the forces of an airborne attack assigned to suppress them 
is not reflected in the models. The actions of echelons and 
groups for PVO suppression are not modeled as a consequence of 
this, and the outcome of the confrontation is not always taken 
into account in the evaluation. 
  Third, the results of a decision issued for 
display should reflect the situation in dynamic mode, the 
position of the opposing sides in space, in real time, using 
three-dimensional graphics. Most of the existing MMs and RZs do 
not meet this requirement, since they issue for display the 
results of decisions in the form of tables, graphs and contour 
lines. 
  Thus, the scientists of the PVO Troops, in order to meet the 
needs of practice, must develop a system of mathematical models 
and computational tasks using a uniform methodological 
foundation; possessing hierarchical coordinability and 
systems-engineering coordinability of the indicators and 
criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of combat operations, 
allowing staff officers to uncover the possible intentions of an 
airborne enemy, evaluate his potential capabilities, predict the 
outcome of a confrontation of the sides, optimize variations for 
the actions of the enemy and his troops and depict the 
three-dimensional position of the opposing sides in dynamic 
fashion. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] The requirements for the level of training 
of 
staff officers are growing. No one today doubts the necessity of 
improving the methods of instilling skills in modeling a 
confrontation of SVN and PVO, analyzing the results and 
preparing proposals substantiated by computations. But what 
about this question -- how will all this be achieved? The more 
so as the forms and methods of training today contradict the 
requirements of progress in the military arts. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] That same scientific and technical progress, 
on the other hand, gives us the opportunity to increase the 
efficiency of staff officer training through the incorporation 
into operational and combat training of computer games and 
automated systems for modeling the combat situation. The tasks 
of gaming combat operations must be resolved with the use of 
modern computer hardware united into local networks. This will 
make it possible to perform an evaluation of the conceptual 
framework of the operational application of PVO formations 
according to the results of multivariable modeling, and to 
determine the optimal variations for the combat application of 
PVO formations and large units of the PVO Troops and special 
troops, as well as to obtain objective evaluations of the level 
of professional training of the officers of directorates and 
staffs at all levels. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] How do matters stand in this regard with the 
use of automated systems for modeling the combat situation in 
the United States and the other NATO countries? 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] You can have no doubt that they are 
proceeding apace with scientific and technical progress there. A 
center for modeling the combat environment, for example, has 
been created at the Ramstein Air Base (Germany). A practical 
verification of the capabilities of the center was performed 
during the comprehensive Ex-91 and Cactus Juggler-92 command and 
staff exercises, as well as the Caravanguard-91 and Reforger-92 
exercises. 
  The spending for the actual performance of exercises on the 
scale of Cactus Juggler-92, in the estimation of the NATO 
combined forces command in Europe, would be 100-150 million 
dollars, while the cost of the computer version did not exceed 
one million dollars. 
  The partial utilization of the combat-environment modeling 
center during the Reforger-92 exercises made it possible to 
reduce the cost of conducting them by 25-30 percent compared to 
prior years. Need one be persuaded that the adoption of computer 
games into the process of training, under conditions of cutbacks 
in appropriations for the maintenance of the armed forces, 
including spending on military training, is a promising 
direction for improving the operational and combat training of 
the PVO Troops? 
  This direction is also a promising one because it makes 
possible, along with a reduction in spending, a rise in the 
quality of training via the repeated processing of different 
variations for the start and waging of combat operations. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] I was telling you something at the beginning 
of our discussion, Viktor Pavlovich, that you undoubtedly know 
perfectly well yourself -- questions of the automation of combat 
training have long been under study in the armed forces. The 
development of MMs and RZs, in particular, have been underway in 
the interests of the staffs for more than 25 years now. An 
extensive store -- or better yet, a base of MMs and RZs -- has 
been created over that time. You will agree, however, that the 
effectiveness of their application for the preparation of 
operational-tactical computations and the study of the processes 
of operations (combat operations) remains low as before. What is 
going on here? 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] There is a host of reasons here. One of the 
main ones consists of the absence of uniform methodological, 
operational-tactical, informational and mathematical foundations 
for the structuring and application of models. Various models 
for one and the same purpose thus meet varying requirements, and 
various approaches were applied to their development. These have 
not been included, and cannot be combined into a unified system 
of software support for the command and control of troops 
without the corresponding refinement and development. 
  The available models, as a rule, do not take into account 
all 
of the principal factors that have an effect on the course and 
outcome of operations (combat operations). There are still too 
few efficient models that would provide for the issue of the 
necessary data in real time for staff activity, answer the main 
questions in the preparation of operations (combat operations) 
and be of practical assistance to the commanding officers or 
commanders and staffs in devising solutions and planning 
operations of higher quality and in more operative fashion. 
  This situation makes urgently necessary the devising of 
uniform requirements for staff models. The work that has been 
started at the PVO Military Academy imeni G.K. Zhukov for the 
creation of imitative models of bilateral combat operations for 
units in the branches of our forces and the comprehensive 
modeling of combat operations by large PVO units and formations 
is deserving of attention in this regard. The initiatives of 
scholars at the academy to create simulation and imitative 
systems are also deserving of attention and support; dynamic 
models of the confrontation of SVN and PVO are inherent in those 
systems, making it possible to reveal uncertainties in the 
actions of the enemy, predict the outcome of the confrontation, 
optimize the variations of the actions of the enemy and his 
troops and depict the results of the computations in dynamic 
form, and the actions of the sides in space and time using a 
three-dimensional graph. 
  I am convinced of the expediency of continuing the work to 
create mathematical models, computational tasks, and dynamic 
scenarios of the confrontation of SVN and PVO, with their 
subsequent incorporation into the practice of operational and 
combat training. This would make it possible to increase 
markedly the effectiveness of training for staff officers at all 
levels, through the more detailed study of various aspects of 
logical-analysis and logical-synthesis activity. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] So if the task of providing a uniform 
methodological approach in the creation of the foundations for 
the computerization of the training and combat processes (and 
there should be no doubt of this) faces us once again, what 
requirements should those foundations meet? 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] I will list the principal ones as a start. 
They are a uniformity of the operational-tactical fundamentals 
for structuring it; the trustworthiness of the results of 
modeling; operativeness in the receipt of results; conformity to 
the level of command; a systemic approach; standardization of 
the indicators and standards used; and, uniformity of the 
information base. 
  The requirement for uniformity of the 
operational-tactical fundamentals of structuring the models 
envisages the necessity of the complete realization of the basic 
principles of the military arts, and first and foremost those 
such as a determined concentration of efforts in the most 
important areas, the uninterrupted nature of combat operations, 
the comprehensive and coordinated application of all manpower 
and resources, and uninterrupted command and control, support 
and combat operations. This requirement, moreover, assumes the 
observance of a uniform substance of the specific operation 
(combat operations) and structure of the conceptual model, and a 
formalized description of the processes using the corresponding 
mathematical methods. 
  The trustworthiness of the results of modeling is 
understood to mean a sufficiently precise reflection of the most 
material aspects of the processes being modeled and the general 
laws characteristic of them. Trustworthiness of the results can 
be achieved not only through the modeling of the most 
substantial aspects of the operation or combat operations, but 
also through a correct regard for the connections between them 
and a suitable regard for the various factors, conditions of the 
situation and methods of combat and supporting operations. 
  The PVO formations, in my opinion, should take into account 
the following basic factors and conditions of the situation in 
order to fulfill the requirement of the trustworthiness of the 
results in the model of an operation or combat operations. 
  Regarding the enemy: 

  -  the composition, basing, TTKh [tactical-performance 
characteristics] and operating methods of enemy SVKN [air and 
space offensive weaponry]; 
  -  the combat readiness of SVKN; 
  -  the 
employment of conventional and nuclear weapons, cruise missiles 
launched from various platforms, long-range radar-detection and 
reconnaissance-strike aircraft systems; 
  -  the fire and electronic 
suppression of PVO Troops and assets; 
  -  the maneuvering 
capabilities of SVN; 
  -  the capabilities of command-and-control and 
navigational systems; 
  -  the capabilities for repeat operations by 
SVN; 
  -  enemy losses in the course of repelling his strikes and 
capabilities for reinforcing forces in various sectors; 
  -  and, the 
level of enemy knowledge on the PVO system. 

    Regarding one's own forces: 

  -  composition, stationing, TTKh and operational methods; 
  -  the 
combat readiness of units and large formations; 
  -  the employment 
of conventional weaponry and missiles with special charges; 
  -  the 
fire and electronic suppression of the enemy; 
  -  the maneuvering 
capabilities of PVO Troops and assets; 
  -  the capabilities of 
reconnaissance, command-and-control, guidance and support 
systems; 
  -  the capabilities for repeat operations by PVO Troops 
and assets; 
  -  interaction; 
  -  the stability of elements of the PVO 
system; 
  -  troop losses; 
  -  restoration of the fighting ability of 
units and large formations; 
  -  the availability of false positions 
and forces; 
  -  and the utilization of reserves. 

    Regarding targets, conditions and the area of combat 
operations: 

  -  targets in the defense and their characteristics; 
  -  the 
state of the airfield network; 
  -  the radar environment; 
  -  the 
electronic environment; 
  -  and the specific military-geographical 
features of the area of combat operations. 

    Operativeness is understood to mean the 
possibility of obtaining and making practical use of the results 
for the necessary quantity of variations of modeling in the 
rhythm of staff work. Evaluations of operativeness must take 
into account the total time expended for the preparation of 
data, the entry of that data into the computers, the machine 
computations and issue of results to the display devices or 
documentation, and for the operational-tactical analysis of the 
results obtained. 
  Conformity to the level of command is understood 
to mean the use, in a model, of information with a level of 
detail and precision that is characteristic of this level of 
command and control, and the depiction of the results of 
modeling in a visual form that corresponds to the form and 
content of the documents that are developed by the staff at the 
given level. The requirement for conformity to the level of 
command conditions the necessity, on the one hand, of 
maintaining an equal degree of detail for each partial process, 
and on the other of aggregating the indicators used to the 
extent of ascension from the tactical to the strategic scale. 
Higher-level models should thus make use of data obtained in 
models from lower levels, in the form of summarized indicators 
and standards. The horizontal links between models at lower 
levels should be taken into account therein. 
  Important to ensure meeting the requirement for the 
model to conform to the level of command is the selection 
of the primary object (element) of the modeling. This question 
remains unresolved up to the present. As a result, the 
individual PVO asset is taken as the primary object in certain 
models, for example, the subunit in others, and the unit or 
larger formation etc. in still others, even though the model was 
developed for one and the same level of command and control. 
  The selection of the primary object of modeling should be 
made according to the following criteria: 
  First, the object should be the foundation of the structural 
entity for a given level of command and control, through which 
the composition of the field formation of the given level is 
defined. The force composition of a fighter air regiment [IAP], 
for example, is typified by the quantity of fighters, and a 
surface-to-air missile brigade [ZRBR] or regiment by the 
quantity of systems. The primary object of modeling for the 
former is consequently the fighter, and for the latter the 
system. 
  The composition of the PVO formation, as a rule, is 
determined by the quantity of units and formations of the 
branches of service, and the unit or formation could 
consequently be considered the primary object for a model of the 
operation. 
  Second, the object should have a significant influence on 
the 
results of the modeling. The results of the battle of an 
individual system and fighter, for example, will be significant 
for the ZRBR and IAP and insignificant for the large PVO 
formation. The battalion and fighter are thus primary for a 
model of battle, and the IAP and ZRBR for a model of the 
operation. 
  Third, the elements of the object should be located on the 
terrain in compact fashion. The IAP or ZRBR, say, could be 
considered the primary object for the model of an operation, 
since the elements of that object are located on the terrain in 
relatively compact fashion, while the large formation or EW unit 
could not be considered a primary object for the same model, 
since it does not possess the trait of compactness, not to 
mention the fact that the capabilities of individual EW 
subunits, especially forward ones, could prove to have a 
substantial influence on the results of modeling the operation. 
  The requirement for a systemic approach signifies 
that the model should be a constituent element of a unified 
system of software support for the command and control of troops 
that is coordinated with others by aim, purpose, operational 
allocation, composition of factors taken into account, 
limitations and allowances, indicators and standards, system of 
classifying and coding data, principles for the protection of 
information, etc. Any RZ or model, in accordance with this 
requirement, should be developed as a constituent element of the 
whole and be characterized by a functional completeness, and 
have the possibility of realization both autonomously and as 
part of a definite system. 
  The requirement for the standardization of indicators 
and standards consists of performing calculations and 
modeling of combat operations using indicators and standards 
that are coordinated among each other. 
  The uniformity of the information base assumes the 
use of databases in the machine as the object of collective and 
multipurpose use, and assurance of the uniformity of one and the 
same data for various models and computational tasks. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] There are probably other special technical 
requirements that support the reliable operational and thematic 
substance of the mathematical models and computational tasks. 
Could we dwell on those you listed? It will be no less 
important, in my opinion, to clarify what properties a unified 
system of software support for the command and control of troops 
(SMOUV) should possess. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] First, the software support should reflect 
the actual physical and information processes. If the staffs are 
fed a flow of data being processed by computer, then the 
officers preparing the proposals and making the decision must 
combine the creative principle with the results of modeling and 
computations. The SMOUV must consequently have an immediate 
influence on command and control. 
  Second, the software support (models, RZs etc.) is, as it 
were, the collective reasoning of people put into material form, 
and should naturally provide intellectual support for the work 
of staffs and other command elements. 
  Third, the SMOUV is inseparably linked with the theory of 
command, since its structure and content depend on the structure 
and content of the processes of command and control of the 
troops. A direct and reciprocal link thus exists between the 
theory of command and the SMOUV. The use of the SMOUV thus 
stimulates the development of command theory, and the theory the 
development of the SMOUV. The SMOUV acts as a uniting link 
between the theory and practice of command. 
  Thus, there is the conclusion that the SMOUV is becoming an 
organic constituent element of command and control, and should 
have a substantial influence on the substance and methods of 
staff work. 
  The properties cited provide grounds to consider it 
expedient 
to recognize software support for command and control as a new 
category of the military arts, and the operational arts in 
particular. This recognition provides a correct orientation for 
theory, will make possible a more complete regard for the 
requirements of practice and will lead to more energetic efforts 
not only by the commanding officers and staffs, but also 
military scholars on questions of improving command and control 
of the troops at a qualitatively new level. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] In concluding our discussion I would ask 
you, 
Viktor Pavlovich, to provide at least a general outline of 
promising directions in the development and improvement of 
systems of software support for the troops. 
  [V.P. Sinitsyn] These would be, first and foremost, the 
development of the methodological, operational-tactical, 
mathematical and information foundations for constructing and 
employing software support within the framework of a unified 
system. The creation of scientific-methodological means and a 
methodology of constructing the system and its elements, along 
with the evaluation of the suitability of the models and the 
effectiveness of their application, is an important area of this 
work. General organizational-methodological foundations for the 
development and incorporation of models and RZs are needed. 
  The creation of fundamentally newer and more suitable models 
is a topical task. The problem of the optimal nature of the 
decisions made is a central one in the command and control of 
troops, and is directly linked with the quality of the models 
and the computational tasks. The adoption of a model for use is 
of an evaluative nature today. The use of such models 
predetermines the necessity of ascertaining several variations 
of the actions of the sides, with a quantitative evaluation of 
each of them according to an accepted criterion. The method of 
running through variations reduces the operativeness of command 
and control, and forces a limitation on the number of 
variations. The selection of the best from among variations 
being considered does not give full confidence that it is the 
optimal one, or meets the conditions of the situation to the 
full extent. The creation of optimized models that make it 
possible to devise the most acceptable variation for troop 
operations under the set conditions of a situation is thus an 
important task. 
  The development of techniques for the application of models 
and computational tasks, the operational-tactical analysis of 
the results obtained and the devising of new methods of staff 
work with the use of software support should be considered a no 
less important area. 
  In connection with the fact that the use of formalized 
methods in the practical activity of commanding officers and 
staffs to resolve many intellectual tasks is difficult, the 
creation of expert systems is an exceedingly important and, at 
the same time, extraordinarily complex task. 
  Particular attention should be devoted to researching the 
problem of constructing expert systems. It would be expedient to 
perform special, comprehensive scientific-research work, with 
the aim of gradually creating such systems. Only the 
availability and application of expert systems will provide 
effective intellectual support for the work of staffs and other 
command and control elements. 
  [M. Zakharchuk] Thank you for the discussion.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Military Sciences Colonel Antoliy </F>
Zakharenko under the rubric "Military Training": "We Want a 
Mobile Defense, But We Are Planning a Static One...--How 
Can This Contradiction Be Resolved?"] 
  [Text] The journal has published materials before on 
the organization and waging of mobile surface-to-air missile 
defense (ZRO). In this article Colonel A. Zakharenko touches on 
one of its most important problems--the commander's plan to wage 
mobile ZRO, and the devising of a plan for combat operations 
that would correspond to that type of defense. 
  The idea of organizing and conducting the mobile 
surface-to-air missile defense (ZRO) of fixed targets of the 
military and economic potential of Russia and its armed forces 
has been gaining more and more popularity among military 
scholars and practitioners among the surface-to-air missile 
forces [ZRV] with time. The experience of local wars and 
military conflicts has served as the foundation for this idea. 
The conceptual framework for mobile ZRO, in its most general 
form, consists of the following: 
  Mobile ZRO is created on the basis of the mobile forces and 
assets of the ZRV and is waged with the widespread employment of 
maneuver by them, both before the start (in immediate 
preparations) and in the course of combat operations. The mobile 
ZRDNs [SAM battalions] are maintained in peacetime in a 
non-deployed state in parking areas near military compounds 
built close to the targets or non-mobile (fixed) ZRV sites being 
defended. The battalions are deployed to training positions that 
are selected in the immediate proximity of the military 
compounds to rehearse combat training tasks. A limited number of 
ZRDNs of a larger ZRV unit, deployed at specially equipped duty 
positions, are on combat alert status. 
  The ZRDNs, in accordance with the plans for combat 
operations, are brought up during periods of threat to their 
primary battle positions, from which the repulsion of the first 
enemy air strikes is planned. The execution of maneuvers by the 
ZRDNs within their deployment areas to alternate battle 
positions, according to previously determined variations, is 
expected later in order to provide for the survivability of the 
unit or, according to the situation, to restore destroyed SAM 
missile systems, as well as to perform new tasks that arise. 
This concept has been codified in the guidelines with the coming 
of highly mobile SAM systems into service with the ZRV; in 
practice, however, the troops, as well as the tactical theory of 
the ZRV, still have a host of problems that make its complete 
realization more difficult. One of those problems, in my 
opinion, is the development and adoption of the plan for waging 
mobile ZRO by the unit commander and the preparation of the 
combat documents. 
  The general plan of the unit commander and the plan for 
combat operations are currently worked out in detail for the 
primary combat positions. The scenario formulates, in 
particular, variations for the maneuvers of the ZRDN and the 
conditions for performing them, which are reflected on the map 
of the unit commander's plan in the form of tables that indicate 
the time of the maneuver to the first (for the first variation) 
and the second (for the second variation) alternate positions, 
as well as in the form of a graphical card for the frequency of 
coverage of the ZRDN envelopes for the maneuver variations. It 
follows from this that a variation of a maneuver assumes a shift 
of battle positions by all ZRDNs. But can we be sure that the 
enemy will give us such an opportunity -- to realize a selected 
variation of maneuver completely? 
  Priority in the selection of a variation and the moment of a 
strike belongs to the airborne enemy. We will thus not be able 
to maneuver all ZRDNs into their alternate positions 
simultaneously. The duration of the period of threat and the 
time intervals between strikes in the course of combat 
operations are also determined by the airborne enemy. There thus 
may not be enough time for the sequential and orderly 
maneuvering of ZRDNs to alternate positions. 
  Having deployed the units in battle formation in their 
primary areas during a period of threat, on the other hand, we 
should maneuver the ZRDNs within their deployment areas 
according to a previously worked-out schedule at least within a 
day (the concrete time is determined by the capabilities of 
enemy reconnaissance in the sector where combat operations are 
being conducted). And that means the repulsion of the first 
strikes by an airborne enemy will be repelled by a ZRDN not from 
the primary positions, for which a plan of operations has been 
developed in detail and the combat missions have been assigned 
to the subunits, but rather from the alternate positions. And 
that is just where the actions of the subunits have been defined 
very vaguely. 
  A plan for the combat operations of a unit developed today 
based on a commander's plan for combat operations oriented 
toward waging a "positional" (from fixed positions) defense thus 
does not fully conform to the principles of mobile ZRO. 
  What can be proposed to overcome this contradiction? 
  The following approach to preparing and conducting mobile 
ZRO 
has been tried out in KShU [command/staff exercises] by those 
studying in the ZRV faculty, as well as in the ZRV units headed 
by officers M. Perfilov, L. Rusenchik and P. Krikun. 
  Proceeding from a combat task that has been received and an 
assessment of the situation, the required values of 
surface-to-air missile fire are determined that correspond to 
the necessary correlation of forces with an airborne enemy -- 
the size of the area of air-defense missile fire, its density at 
the assigned lines, the number of firings and their 
effectiveness, and the frequency of target or area coverage. 
  A system of air-defense missile fire, as is well known, is 
created via the deployment of units in battle formation. The 
basic parameters of the battle formation -- the standard 
distances of the ZRDN from the target being defended 
([.sup]sp[/]) and the intervals between their positions 
(J[.sup]sp[/]), as well as the distances between deployment 
lines of ZRDNs of various echelons when their deployment in 
echelons is necessary -- are thus calculated on the basis of the 
required indicators of the firing system that have been 
received. These parameters are used to determine the dimensions 
of the ZRDN deployment areas in the assigned deployment area of 
the large formation or unit. 
  A system of battle positions is selected in the deployment 
areas of the ZRDNs that allows the fullest possible realization 
of the capabilities of the ZRDNs to defeat enemy SVN [offensive 
air weapons] at very low altitudes and maneuvering routes. The 
quantity of battle positions is not limited on a tactical plane 
therein -- the more the better (including on the maneuvering 
routes, within the limits of their capabilities). The rejection 
of the existing division of positions into battle, training and 
alert, and battle positions into primary and alternate, seems 
expedient. All of the battle positions are considered equivalent 
and, to the extent of capabilities (when they are accessible), 
are assimilated by the battalions during peacetime in the 
practicing of combat-training missions and in the course of 
alert duty. The apprehension expressed by some specialists that 
this will allow the enemy to uncover the system of positions, in 
my opinion, does not conform to the intent of highly mobile ZRO. 
  So the system of battle positions has been determined. The 
schedule of maneuver of the ZRDNs according to the ZRO plan is 
then worked out. It should be optimized on the terms of 
preserving the assigned (required) parameters of the firing 
system at any moment in time, the minimum time and economic 
expenditures for performing the maneuvers, and the limitations 
of the systems of reconnaissance, command and control, and 
technical and rear support. It can also be tied to deceptive 
measures to confuse the enemy, and with the operations of 
interacting and covering formations and units. A possible 
variation of a schedule is shown in Fig. 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-012-14A>           Fig. 1. Schedule of the combat </FIG>





    Recall that the necessary data regarding all of the 
positions 
should be entered into the local computer network--the 
information and computational system (IRS)--of the ZRV unit 
ahead of time. The IRS monitors the taking of battle positions 
by the battalions during a period of threat and the performance 
of maneuvers according to the ZRO plan, and issues 
recommendations for the performance of maneuvers during the 
course of combat operations based on the situation. 
  The cutbacks in the armed forces that are taking place 
within 
the framework of military reform and, as a consequence, the 
necessity that is arising for the efficient performance of 
combat tasks using limited personnel and assets is an argument 
of no small importance in favor of this variation for organizing 
and conducting mobile ZRO. 
  The angular dimensions of the deployment areas of the ZRDNs 
(deployment sectors) calculated relative to the hypothetical 
center of the target or area being defended may then be assigned 
to battalions as their primary sectors (_a_[.sup]pr[/]) when 
performing mobile operations by means of combat patrols within 
the deployment area of an air-defense missile brigade (ZRBR). 
The primary sectors of battalions (_b_[.sup]pr[/]) when 
maneuvering ZRDNs using combat patrols within their deployment 
areas are best designated according to the bisectors of the 
neighboring deployment sector (so that no gaps appear in the 
system of fire when performing missions by this or that ZRDN). 
These sectors are best used for organization and interaction 
with one's own fighters (Fig. 2).

    The assignment of the primary sectors (search and firing) of 
the ZRDNs at low altitudes and alert duty sectors for group 
search seems extremely difficult when organizing and conducting 
mobile ZRO with an increased number of possible positions in the 
deployment area of a ZRDN. This requires a great deal of time 
for the performance of calculations and coordination, and means 
that the mobility of the ZRO will be limited; they should 
consequently be rejected. 
  The assignment of the combat mission to the mobile ZRDN 
should thus include the boundaries of the deployment area, the 
primary sector, the system of battle positions, and the schedule 
and maneuvering signals. These data are reflected on the maps of 
the unit commander's plan for combat operations and on the maps 
of the ZRDN commanders. 
  This approach to the development and formulation of the 
commanders' plans for waging mobile ZRO corresponds more to 
reality than the one employed today among the troops that is 
based on prevailing directive documents. 
  From the editors: Such are the views and 
recommendations of a scholar for the organization and planning 
of mobile ZRO. True, we do not share them completely. The 
readers possibly also have other viewpoints and proposals. We 
await your letters.

<F P=106> [Responses to reader letter by several officers, prepared by </F>
Colonel Aleksey Andreytsov and Lieutenant-Colonel Aleksandr 
Tarapatin under the rubric "Servicing of Hardware and Weaponry: 
"`The Hardware, Well, the Hardware Later..."] 
  [Text] "Dear Editors! 
  "To paraphrase the words of the well-known song, it 
could be asserted that the aircraft come first, first the 
aircraft, and the hardware, well, the hardware later... Such is 
life. We have not received our special clothing or gloves for 
two years now. The `clothes people' have moreover said that the 
service lives of the fur articles have been increased due to 
difficulties with supply. 
  "The motor vehicles are completely worn out. The TM-59 
heating vehicles, for instance, have already served more than 
one decade, and have undergone several overhauls. We have to 
manufacture the heating vehicles using whatever's lying around, 
in homemade fashion. There is a chemical method for fighting 
surface ice build-up, of course, but the concrete surface gets 
ruined from it, and the ecology will weep bitter tears as well. 
  "It's bad enough that the hardware sits in unheated 
tents. Try and drive out after you start it up -- the heaters 
don't work, and there are not enough blowtorches to heat up the 
oil in the crankcase. And that's not to mention the worsening 
supply of fuel, oil, spare parts and other mat&eacute;riel for 
flights because of the unbalanced state of the economy. 
  "Now everyday living. We are living in a single-story 
wood-panel barracks. The steam heating radiators leak. The roof 
is falling apart. The electric lighting goes out sometimes. Only 
fragments remain, if you will pardon me, of the lavatory. After 
flights you are so `drained' that you want to take a bath and a 
steam in the bathhouse. Go right ahead... 20 kilometers away. It 
is simpler if you are not married. But what about those with 
families? The children are taught in the same barracks in three 
shifts. When they finish, what then? The library is closed -- 
there is no job slot for it. They show films from the times of 
the Khrushchev thaw. The commissary is stuffed with scarce 
goods, but the prices really sting. It is difficult to maintain 
a family, since most of the wives are not working. There are no 
jobs. So the specialists are running away. Those who are a 
little older and have nowhere to go simply toil in silence, and 
endure the drudgery. Those who are a little weaker in spirit 
take to drink, since there is plenty to be had. They cry on 
someone's shoulder, and that is enough. In short, I still have 
faith in future changes. But will that faith last for long?" 
  --Senior Lieutenant Andrey Skorobogatov. 
  The author's indignation regarding the increasingly 
difficult problems in the servicing and maintenance of aviation 
equipment is understandable to us. Most technical specialists, 
to all appearances, share his opinion as well. This can be seen 
from their letters to the editor and from the materials that 
have been published on this topic in the journal. 
  Yes, the situation is a difficult one. We could sit 
with arms folded and wait for our last breath, on the one hand, 
or we could ask determinedly, doggedly and inventively at all 
levels to see that the technical services survive in these 
difficult economic times, and support the process of combat 
training for the fighter pilots to the full extent. That is 
indeed the approach to matters that has been planned, in our 
opinion, in the aviation rear-support services of the PVO 
[Air-Defense] Forces. Here is what the corresponding officers 
had to say in answer to the angry questions of the author. 
<H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Chief of Staff 
Major-General F. Klus </H3>
  Background: Frants Iosofovich Klus was born 
in 1944. He completed the Military Academy for Rear Support and 
Transport. He has served in the Baltic Fleet, the Transcaucasus 
and the Moscow PVO District. Major-General F. Klus has been 
chief of staff of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces 
since July 1992. 
  Airfield technical flight support is a crucial, multifaceted 
and complex process. It demands highly trained specialists and 
the use of diverse technical equipment. Specialists of the 
aviation-technical, airfield-engineering, and electrical and gas 
services, along with the aviation weaponry service, are occupied 
with these problems in the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO 
Forces. The spectrum of tasks they perform is most diverse. They 
include those that Senior Lieutenant Skorobogatov names in his 
angry letter to the editors. 
  It is bitter and disappointing read such "epistles" (and 
they 
are being encountered more and more often in our own mail as 
well, and not just in letters to the editor), but there is no 
way to get away from them. And if we approach this voice from 
the field more seriously, we detect a grave paradox: The heads 
of the chiefs of various ranks are still more worried about 
getting the aircraft up and hitting the target than about whose 
hands are "reviving" that equipment. 
  I repeat -- all of this is distressing. But we will be 
realists. It is difficult for the rear-support services to reach 
each flier. That is the prerogative of the commanders of the 
aviation technical units. The tasks of flight support, including 
the organization of food for flight and technical personnel, 
clothing for officers and warrant officers, bath and laundry 
services for the conscript soldiers and NCOs and the maintenance 
of the housing and barracks stock, are resolved in those units 
as a group. 
  The aviation headquarters, detached airfield 
technical-support battalions and aviation-technical bases, aside 
from the enumerated tasks, support the combat alert duty of 
fighter aviation. They perform this latter task with more and 
more difficulty each day. This is caused, first and foremost, by 
the low manpower levels of the units. They are at 35-40 percent 
today, while the amount of tasks they perform remains the same! 
I would add, with profound regret, that this problem is not 
always taken into account by the staffs of the aviation 
regiments, making the resolution of these problems even more 
difficult. I have in mind here not a decline in exactingness 
toward the quality of flight support, but rather the fact that 
the capabilities of the aviation technical units are not always 
taken into account when planning flights, and they are not given 
the necessary assistance. 
  The crisis in the economy, on the other hand, has had a 
sharp 
impact on logistical support for PVO aviation. A number of 
enterprises that were producing and performing overhauls on 
flight ground-support equipment have ended up outside our 
borders. These include those producing the AMK-24/56 airfield 
air-conditioning equipment in Baku and the TM-59MG heating 
vehicle in Minsk, among others. And what can one say about the 
supply of aviation technical mat&eacute;riel anyway, when we are 
left without a quarter of the enterprises that produce spare 
parts and assemblies for the aircraft? 
  Aircraft engines for transport aviation have stopped coming 
from Zaporozhye, and Il-76 aircraft and spare parts for them 
from Tashkent. The question of repairs for MiG-25 aircraft 
engines has not yet been resolved. Matters are no better with 
the training of specialists. The well-equipped detached training 
regiment for aviation support has ended up, strictly speaking, 
abroad. The funds are gone, as they say, while we are left with 
our own interests. We are putting the question point-blank. But 
easier said than done... The creation of such a training 
regiment on territory of Russia is still in the decision stage. 
  Financing spending for the procurement of aviation technical 
flight-support equipment and aviation technical mat&eacute;riel 
has 
become much more difficult. The funds initially allocated for 
the aviation rear-support services have been redirected to 
solving other problems. The placement of orders with industry 
has been disrupted. 
  The departure of the logistical-support service from the 
composition of rear support has disrupted the structure of 
logistical supply, servicing and repair of weaponry and hardware 
right in the field that had been operating without problems. 
  The aviation rear-support service does not have the legal 
rights or monetary means to conclude contracts and acquire 
products for production-engineering purposes. All of this is 
resolved according to the "whatever's-left-over" principle. As a 
result, whereas in 1992 the requirements of PVO aviation for 
products for production-engineering purposes were only 
50-percent satisfied, only 10 percent of contracts have been 
concluded for 1993. This, of course, reduces the quality of 
airfield technical support for aviation flights. Whence all of 
the other misfortunes, including those they are writing about 
from the field. We still see no end to the problems. I hope the 
chiefs of the services will talk about them more concretely. 
<H3>  PVO Forces Rear Support Aviation Weaponry Service Chief 
Lieutenant-Colonel N. Tarasov </H3>
  Background: Nikolay Anatolyevich Tarasov 
completed the Perm Military Aviation-Technical School in 1978, 
and seven years later the Military Aviation Engineering Academy 
imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. He has served in the Southern Group of 
Forces and the North Kazakhstan Military District in various 
positions in the aviation armaments service. He has been chief 
of the aviation armaments of the Rear-Support Directorate of the 
PVO Forces since November of 1990. 
  The uninterrupted support of units with aviation armaments 
(ASP) is known to be one of the basic conditions for their 
fighting ability and combat readiness. The pursuit of the 
necessary measures to maintain ASP in constant readiness, and 
competent servicing and storage are entrusted to the specialists 
of our service. 
  We strive with all of our might to provide cover and 
reliable 
protection for ASP stores at air bases and storage areas for 
missile armaments and ordnance, both in the rear and at the 
engineering stations in the zones of dispersion of the squadrons 
of air regiments. This is especially topical of late. There have 
been instances of penetration by outsiders in certain regions. 
They continue to attack ordnance stores. 
  There are also other matters affecting the normal operation 
of the armaments soldiers. There is a catastrophic shortage of 
storage space. New storage is being built at an exceedingly slow 
pace, owing to the reduction in appropriations. Moreover, 
effective measures are not always taken in the field to avert 
violations in the organization of storage or the handling 
regimen. 
  Inspections conducted by officers of our service show that 
there have been virtually no attempts at the penetration of 
stores areas by outsiders in the units where they approach these 
matters with all seriousness. I would like to note the creative 
and purposeful work of the chiefs of the aviation armaments 
services of the formations of Colonel A. Kuzmin and 
Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zvonov. 
  There are, unfortunately, still more negative examples in 
our 
service than positive ones. They are unable to equip facilities 
for the storage of armaments and ordnance with technical 
security devices in some units. There have been instances of 
unprincipled behavior and a failure to perform their duties by 
officials. 
  All of this is not facilitating any improvements in the 
matter. The question of servicing and technical maintenance is 
meanwhile becoming exceedingly important. I am not exaggerating 
at all. The very process of maintaining contemporary guided 
aviation missiles has become considerably more difficult. The 
servicing of ASP has become very expensive. Other factors could 
be cited as well. The old maintenance system is nonetheless 
being used even on new types of missiles to this day, where the 
basic operations are performed at certain time intervals. 
  This was justified with regard to missile armaments in which 
mechanical and electro-mechanical structural elements 
predominated. The elemental base of recent models is completely 
different. The proportionate share of electro-mechanical 
assemblies and systems has been reduced considerably. It is thus 
essential to move from calendar-based technical maintenance [TO] 
to servicing based on condition, with the volume and frequency 
of monitoring stipulated by the servicing documentation therein, 
and the start and amount of TO determined depending on the 
technical state of the missiles. 
  The technical condition of the ASP is determined in this 
context either using the method of monitoring the level of 
reliability, in which the constituent items are operated until 
fail-safe with the performance of planned operations to detect 
and eliminate the defects, or by means of the monitoring of 
parameters characterizing the technical condition of the units. 
This would scarcely be understandable to everyone, but it makes 
no sense here yet and would be very difficult to expand the 
bounds of the customary and usual. 
  Matters are also not being improved by the organizational 
separation of the specialists in aviation armaments at all 
levels of rear support and aviation of the PVO Forces that 
exists today. They are performing a uniform combat task, after 
all. The functional ties of rear-support and aviation elements 
supporting combat readiness that were prescribed at various 
times by the guiding documents are complex and contradictory, 
owing to the varying subordinations. The lack of a unified 
command and control element or responsibility for the combat 
readiness of aviation missiles and their maintenance, storage 
and servicing is not promoting the quality of 
missile-engineering support. 
  The servicing of aviation armaments, by analogy with 
aviation 
hardware, should be a stage in the life cycle from the moment of 
its acceptance in the unit from the manufacturing plant or 
repair element until its shipment for repair or write-off. 
  The creation of the structure of a unified service for 
aviation armaments at all levels of PVO aviation would make it 
possible to eliminate drawbacks and instill order and 
organization into the support of combat readiness for aviation 
units. 
<H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Aviation-Technical 
Service Chief Colonel L. Preobrazhenskiy </H3>
  Background: Colonel Leonid Mikhaylovich 
Preobrazhenskiy has been in the armed forces since 1973. He is 
42 years of age. He completed the Military Academy of Rear 
Support and Transport. He has been chief of the aviation 
technical service of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO 
Forces since April 1992. 
  It does not seem possible to cover the whole range of tasks 
facing the aviation-technical service in a short journal 
article. Suffice it to say that the service annually orders and 
delivers to the units more than 180,000 types of items of 
aviation mat&eacute;riel essential for maintaining the aircraft 
inventory in combat readiness and supporting the everyday 
activity of the flight, engineering and technical personnel and 
the flights of the aircraft in PVO aviation. 
  The service performs all of these tasks in constant 
interaction with the directorate of aviation and the 
aviation-engineering service [IAS] of the PVO Forces. Experience 
shows that aircraft are inevitably standing idle, and that the 
personnel do not receive the mat&eacute;riel that is due 
according 
to the standards in a timely manner, at aviation garrisons where 
constant and businesslike contact and mutual understanding are 
lacking among the officials of the aviation, 
aviation-engineering and aviation-technical services. This can 
be seen very well from the letter of Senior Lieutenant 
Skorobogatov. 
  Questions of providing aviation mat&eacute;riel are 
resolved in 
most stable fashion by the department for aviation support in 
the formation headed by Lieutenant-Colonel G. Kovko, who has 
achieved fulfillment of the plan for expeditionary deliveries to 
the regions of the Far North. 
  The financing allocated by the government of the Russian 
Federation for the provision of aviation mat&eacute;riel in 
1991-93 
remains at the same level. The prices for it have meanwhile gone 
up a hundredfold or more. 
  All of this has forced a review of the whole system of 
ordering, and a concentration of the principal efforts on 
obtaining and delivering as fast as possible to the units the 
spare parts and assemblies only for the aviation hardware that 
is standing idle and the latest models of aircraft, with the 
rest of the requirements for them satisfied only through 
available reserves and aviation mat&eacute;riel obtained from 
repair and after the write-off and cut-up of aircraft being 
removed from service. 
  The situation is complicated by the fact that a considerable 
portion of the aviation mat&eacute;riel is being produced only at 
aviation enterprises in Ukraine and Uzbekistan. An 
intergovernmental agreement between them and Russia on mutual 
deliveries has not been signed, and the output of this 
mat&eacute;riel at aviation plants has not been organized. 
  It follows from this that only the correct determination of 
the quantity of aviation units, engines, assemblies and other 
mat&eacute;riel that has served out its stipulated service life, 
the ascertaining of existing stockpiles in warehouses and their 
efficient utilization and timely redistribution among the units 
will make it possible to maintain the aircraft inventory in good 
working order and support the vital activity of flight, 
engineering and technical personnel. 
  Significant difficulties have arisen lately with the 
delivery 
of mat&eacute;riel to the consumers as well. Some 22 units of 
rolling stock were plundered on railroad lines in the last half 
year alone. The railroad returns the money as compensation for 
the damages, but as is well known, that does not support the 
flights or clothe the people. The involvement of transport 
aviation, continuously occupied with accomplishing the task of 
evacuating personnel and mat&eacute;riel from the Transcaucasus, 
Baltic and Central Asian regions, in the delivery of 
mat&eacute;riel would unjustifiably drag out the time frames for 
the delivery of the mat&eacute;riel, as well as waste the 
"precious" service lives of aircraft engines. 
  I would like to dwell separately on the question of 
providing 
flight personnel with flight and technical clothing. Owing to 
the lack of raw materials, the constantly decreasing number of 
enterprises operating and the constant price increases, the 
enterprises in the woolen industry fulfilled the plan for 
certain items only by 45-60 percent in 1992, and they have not 
produced any leather jackets since May of 1991. The command was 
forced to impose a series of restrictions for that reason. 
  The supplying units were thus temporarily issued directives 
as special instructions to issue fur-lined gloves, leather 
gloves without liners and leather jackets only to pilots, and to 
issue one pair of fur-lined leather gloves to engineering and 
technical personnel for four years and an additional pair of fur 
mittens for one year. These items are not being issued to other 
categories of servicemen who receive flight and technical 
clothing. 
  The service lives of map holders, navigator's cases, 
inclined 
map tables, unlined fur trousers and fur-lined cotton items have 
been doubled. The service lives of shrouds for aircraft have 
been increased considerably under all climatic conditions. 
  Taking into account the organizational measures being 
carried 
out to cut back the armed forces, the officers, warrant officers 
and servicemen on conscript service are permitted, (when they 
wish and by intercession of the commander of the unit), to keep 
for themselves items of flight and technical clothing regardless 
of their wearing times, for a fee, when being discharged into 
the reserves, retirement for years served or under personnel 
cutbacks. 
  The prices for the items obtained before 1 January 1992 are 
defined therein proceeding from their retail prices in 1991 with 
an increase of 20 percent (value-added tax), while transactions 
for mat&eacute;riel issued to the personnel after 1 January 1992 
are made on the basis of prices from the reference for 2 
February 1992 adjusted for retail and increased by 20 percent. 
  Servicemen who have expressed the desire to continue to 
serve 
in the armed forces of member nations of the CIS that have 
declared the creation of national armies, shall turn over items 
of flight and technical clothing (owing to the shortage of them) 
to supply. A delay by servicemen of more than one month in 
turning them over is considered to be their appropriation 
(theft). 
  The measures enumerated are of course forced; the need for 
them will recede to the extent of the convergence of the 
defensive interests of the countries that make up the near 
abroad today. 
<H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Electrical and Gas 
Service Chief Colonel V. Khokhlov </H3>
  Background: Colonel Vladimir Ivanovich 
Khokhlov was born in 1948 in the city of Temirtau. He has been 
in the armed forces since 1966. He completed the Kiev Higher 
Engineering-Aviation School in 1971. He was in the department 
for training supervisory engineering personnel of the VVIA 
[Military-Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. 
He has served in Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Moscow Oblast and 
Moscow. He has served in positions from the engineer of a 
fighter regiment to the chief of the electrical and gas service 
of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces. 
  A great many tasks are entrusted to the "toilers" of the 
airfields. The safety of the flights of aviation depends to a 
considerable extent on the quality of their fulfillment, the 
timely ordering and delivery of electrical and gas equipment and 
mat&eacute;riel, the organization of the servicing, repair and 
storage of the equipment, the production of oxygen and nitrogen 
and the training of the specialists in this service. 
  There are 150-170 vehicles being operated in every aviation 
technical unit, 70 percent of which are special ones. These are 
the oxygen- and nitrogen-producing stations, the transport tanks 
for liquid oxygen, the gasification installations, the 
standardized compressor and gas-charging stations, the equipment 
for electric-power supply and the start-up of aircraft, the 
check-out and recharging of hydraulic systems (airfield mobile 
electrical units, electric-motor/generators, electro-hydraulic 
systems and installations for checking out the hydraulic 
systems), as well as the means of cooling and heating air 
(airfield air conditioners and standardized motorized heaters). 
The aviation batteries -- which, as opposed to motor-vehicle 
batteries, have large capacity, are difficult to service and are 
very expensive -- also have to be serviced. The specialists of 
this service should thus possess profound knowledge. 
  The chief of the electrical and gas service of MO [Ministry 
of Defense] PVO, Lieutenant-Colonel A. Beletskiy, and the chief 
of the unit's electrical and gas service, Major Yu. Tizengauzen, 
have labored hard and fruitfully this year to retrofit the 
fighter air regiment at the Dorokhovo airfield, equipping the 
regimental technical position with a centralized system for 
electric-power supply and training the personnel in the 
operation of the new type of electrical and gas equipment. 
Eleven units of new electrical and gas equipment have been 
shipped to this unit from the centralized supply of the PVO 
Forces rear support, and the UGZS-63OK gas-charging station has 
been put into service for the first time. Support for the air 
regiment is difficult, however, owing to the shortage of 
specialists. There are only 16 people out of the 59 there should 
be in the electro-technical company, for example, and only three 
out of seven at the oxygen-producing station. 
  The physical demands that these people have to bear are not 
difficult to imagine. This misfortune unfortunately applies to 
most of the aviation-technical units of the PVO Forces. 
  I see the way out of this situation in service on a contract 
basis and in the replacement of military specialists with 
civilian ones. The commander of the aviation technical unit must 
be given more independence to hire specialists from the wage 
fund, and not on a fixed salary. He should determine what 
specialists are needed first and foremost. This would make it 
possible to make more efficient use of the personnel and raise 
the quality of aviation support. 
  The question of junior specialists in the service has also 
not been resolved. They were trained up until 1992 in the 
detached training regiment for aviation rear support in Kerch. 
The training of aviation specialists has been organized at one 
of the schools for junior aviation specialists, with the 
transfer of that regiment to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 
  Classes could be organized in the future on the basis of 
that 
regiment with warrant officers and other specialists of aviation 
rear support, for example in the fuel services, 
airfield-engineer service, aviation armaments service and 
aviation technical service. The performance of these 
organizational measures would thus best be accelerated to the 
benefit of the matter. 
  The necessity has arisen, in connection with the transition 
to a 1.5 year term of service, for a proportionate reduction in 
the training and retraining periods of drivers for army 
conditions. 
  Drivers in the ranks have been trained in the field since 
July 1992. The quality of training for specialists, I think, 
would go up if the DOSAAF schools were assigned to the PVO 
Forces in various regions, depending on the requirements for 
driver personnel. We would in that case have a vital vested 
interest in strengthening those schools with cadres and 
improving their physical plant. 
  An experiment would seem possible here -- assign several 
schools to the rear support of the PVO Forces. We have the 
capability of equipping those schools with new electrical, gas 
and airfield equipment, the more so as it is constantly being 
improved. The drivers and other specialists, after completing 
such a school, would have been purposefully trained and would be 
engaged while in the aviation technical unit only with studying 
the specific features of the principles of the special vehicles 
and their operation at airfields. 
  The personnel have to master various types of hardware under 
varying climatic conditions. The advance, careful preparation of 
hardware and service facilities for the harsh winter and the 
creation of conditions for the performance of technical 
servicing, routine maintenance and repairs of vehicles are 
required in the northern regions and in Siberia. The failure to 
fulfill the requirements for the preparation of the equipment 
leads to the disabling of the special systems and a reduction in 
combat readiness. 
  Additional spending is required in the northern regions for 
the capital construction of heating facilities for the service, 
and locations for the personnel to warm up in the motor pools 
and on the airfields. These requirements are not always being 
met. Only 15 of the 180 vehicles are in heated tents, for 
example, in the aviation technical unit at Berezovka, and there 
are no heated enclosures for servicing and repairing the 
equipment. There have been disruptions in flights in that unit 
as a result, owing to the lack of readiness of the airfield 
technical support equipment; the technical readiness factor of 
the vehicle fleet is too low. 
  We have been forced, despite what is stipulated by 
regulations, to maintain increased stockpiles of electrical and 
gas mat&eacute;riel and a dual set of oxygen-producing station in 
remote and difficult-to-reach areas, in order to support 
autonomous operations. 
  One of the principal problems in the Far East remains the 
supply of oxygen and nitrogen. Many aviation garrisons are 
stationed large distances from industrial centers, or on islands 
or peninsulas. Gas is supplied under those conditions using 
standard oxygen and nitrogen producing stations, and standard 
electric-power stations are moreover used at five out of twelve 
owing to the absence of industrial electric-power supply. There 
are not enough warrant officers because of the lack of housing. 
Half of them are missing at six stations, and there are none at 
all at two in the garrisons of Dzemga and ten sections. 
  Women, who after the appropriate training are permitted to 
perform practical work by order of the commanders of the units, 
are coming to the rescue. 
  One way of solving this problem is to reach direct, 
bilateral 
contract obligations with plants in industry for the delivery of 
gas. Even those, however, are often not fulfilled. The 
Daltekhgaz joint-stock company had failed to ship 100 of the 
planned 200 tonnes of liquid nitrogen as of 1 January 1993. 
  We are experiencing serious difficulties in financing owing 
to the unrestrained rise in prices for gas. 
  The price of one tonne of oxygen was 1,550 rubles, and 
nitrogen 2,450 rubles, as of 1 January 1992. Those prices have 
increased significantly today. The spending of monetary 
resources on payments for gases in the field totaled about 20 
million rubles in 1992, which is tens of times higher than in 
1991. 
  The chiefs of the oxygen and nitrogen producing stations in 
Yelizovo, Captain A. Yermakov, in Burevestnik, Captain A. Dikiy, 
in Postovaya, Captain O. Pakhvashchev, and shift chiefs warrant 
officers Aksenov, Bilenok and many others are meeting their 
obligations in organizing the gas-production work successfully 
in the face of all the difficulties. The repair of the airfield 
technical-support equipment remains a problem. Two of the five 
plants for performing major overhauls are on the territory of 
Ukraine. Our requirements are only met 35-40-percent of the 
time, and matters are especially difficult with regard to 
gas-producing and gas-charging equipment. 
  There are no subunits in the field to perform intermediate 
repairs on electrical and gas equipment, as a result of which 
the vehicles are operated from routine through to major repairs. 
This question has been put before the command more than once, 
but has not been developed. 
  The development of the production base of existing repair 
enterprises in the larger units and detached repair and 
rebuilding battalions and formations would be expedient, in 
order to carry out comprehensive intermediate repairs on 
electrical and gas equipment. 
  The diversity of the tasks facing the service and how they 
are performed determine the nature and intensiveness of the 
utilization of the vehicles. The expenditure of motor-vehicle 
resources is a problem under these conditions. The personnel are 
working under greater demands with the intensive utilization of 
the equipment, and there is not enough time for technical 
maintenance and routine servicing operations. The consumption of 
servicing materials increases, and the danger increases of the 
appearance of preconditions for flight accidents through the 
fault of the personnel. 
  The officers and warrant officers of the electrical and gas 
service, despite all of the difficulties, are devoted to their 
difficult profession and, in interaction with the other services 
of rear support, are doing everything they can to see that the 
equipment entrusted to them is in combat-ready condition. 
<H3>  PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Airfield-Engineering 
Service Chief Lieutenant-Colonel A. Kozhin </H3>
  Background: Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy 
Yuryevich Kozhin was born in the city of Kursk in 1955. He has 
been in the armed forces since 1972. He completed the Voronezh 
Higher Military Aviation-Technical School. He has served in 
airfield-engineering units in the Moscow and Far East districts. 
After completing the Military Engineering Red Banner Institute 
imeni A.F. Mozhayskiy, he was assigned to the apparatus of the 
commander-in-chief of the PVO Forces. He has been chief of the 
airfield-engineering service of the Rear-Support Directorate of 
the PVO Forces since September 1992. 
  The servicing of flight fields, artificial coverings and 
complex and expensive airfield structures has become markedly 
more difficult with the appearance of aircraft that have high 
takeoff and landing characteristics, large flight weights and 
high tire pressures. 
  Whereas the length of runways usually did not exceed 1,200 
meters by the start of World War II, today their dimensions have 
increased several times over, and the materials used to 
construct and maintain them have changed as well. The length of 
taxiways, aircraft parking areas and the ground portions of 
flight fields have increased accordingly. Many different 
structures and systems to support flights have appeared at 
airfields. A whole series of problems is arising in connection 
with the preparation and operation of airfields in the regions 
of the Far North. 
  This pertains first and foremost to the vehicles that fight 
ice buildup on airfields. The TM-59 vehicle, developed as long 
ago as 1959, is still in service in airfield-operations 
subunits. The inventory of these vehicles is completely worn 
out, with each of them having been subjected to a minimum of 5-6 
major overhauls and in service for some 16-18 years now. The jet 
engines used on these vehicles, from older types of aircraft, 
are not produced by industry today. The new vehicles coming to 
the aviation technical units are equipped with the same engines, 
which have been rebuilt and assembled from several parts, which 
in turn reduces their service lives considerably. There has long 
been no stockpile of these engines in the armed forces, while 
the development of a fundamentally new vehicle with a new and 
accessible engine is still not under consideration; this forces 
the independent manufacture of homemade heating vehicles, with 
new aircraft engines, made from whatever is available in the 
field. 
  All of this pertains to the other vehicles used for the 
operational maintenance of airfields as well, on which only the 
base vehicle has actually changed, as a rule, while they 
essentially remain the same as before with the same production 
capabilities. 
  The delivery of new vehicles, especially with the transition 
of the economy to market relations, is limited and difficult in 
view of their high cost, the shortage of jet engines, the lack 
of an adequate quantity of appropriations and the locations of 
the principal supplier plants of airfield operational equipment 
in now-sovereign states. Their overhaul is also performed on the 
territory of the independent state of Ukraine, which often leads 
to unwarranted delays in the performance of repairs and their 
shipment to the units, also reducing the technical-readiness 
factor of the airfield-operation subunits. 
  There is also another way of battling the formation of ice 
on 
artificial surfaces -- chemical-mechanical methods, consisting 
of melting the ice buildup that has occurred with the subsequent 
removal of the by-products of the interaction of reagents with 
the ice. But this does not have full impact in fighting the ice, 
especially when the temperatures of the surrounding air are 
considerable, and has a negative impact on the quality of the 
concrete and the ecology of the environment. These methods can 
thus be used only in extremely limited instances. 
  There are other problems connected with providing the 
aviation technical and airfield-engineering units with the 
engineering equipment supplied through military-district 
channels as well. The shortage of specialists able to work with 
that equipment is also causing enormous unease. The engineering 
equipment levels in rear-support unit are currently less than 50 
percent, and the same goes for specialists. They are being 
trained in the units, and their professional level clearly does 
not meet requirements. 
  There are also not enough junior specialists for the 
airfield-operation equipment, since the rear support of the PVO 
Forces has been left without the training regiment that is now 
on the territory of Ukraine. 
  Another nuance that complicates the operational maintenance 
work of airfields is the removal of the logistical-supply 
service from the composition of rear support; the procurement of 
national-economic equipment, tools for the performance of 
operations on the artificial surfaces and operational materials 
for the maintenance of not only the surfaces of the airfields, 
but also a host of buildings and structures in the service and 
technical infrastructure, was carried out through them until 
quite recently. The rear support of the PVO Forces now does not 
have an independent body that has the right to order products 
for production and technical purposes. 
  These are far from all of the problems arising today in 
airfield engineering support for PVO aviation. We could talk a 
great deal more about the extremely low manpower levels of the 
airfield-operations and airfield-engineering subunits with 
conscript personnel, or the shortage of officer cadres. 
  No difficulties, however, remove from the "field" 
specialists 
their crucial duties for the reliable airfield-engineering 
support of the aviation of the PVO Forces. 
  From the editors: The problems that were 
raised in this correspondence roundtable cannot be resolved in 
an instant. Many of the issues, after all, cannot even be 
removed by the specialists "on high." But they, invested with 
authority, are nonetheless able to ease the service of those who 
are below, on the ground, preparing the equipment to go up into 
the sky. They need only alter somewhat their psychology in 
relation to the specialists of the supporting services, and 
focus on the paraphrased words of that well-known song, "The 
aircraft come first, first the aircraft, and the hardware, well, 
the hardware later..."

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Gulnara Khasanov: "General Pyankov </F>
Doesn't Believe That the Tajik Opposition Could Reach an 
Agreement"] 
  [Text] Russian troops in Tajikistan are 
apprehensively awaiting the end of the Muslim fast of Ramadan, 
after which the uncontrollable Tajik opposition will begin 
active armed operations. Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, the 
commander of joint peacekeeping forces, communicated to 
reporters that the situation may grow worse after 15 March. 
  According to information from the general, antigovernment 
formations armed with Stingers, mortars and heavy artillery are 
beginning to concentrate on the Afghan coast. 
  The frontier regions of Shayertuz, Kumsangir and especially 
Pyandzh, where according to some data the main forces of the 
Tajik opposition are concentrated, are evoking serious concern. 
  The situation in Kurgan-Tyube is becoming explosive. A year 
and a half ago it was here that the civil war in the republic 
began, claiming the lives of tens of thousands of inhabitants. 
Local armed confrontations between uncontrollable groupings that 
had formerly comprised the Popular Front are ongoing there. 
General Pyankov feels that "any provocation from either side 
could lead to slaughter." 
  The situation in Tajikistan also depends directly on 
development of events on the Afghan coast. The possibility is 
not excluded that Afghan General Rashid Dustum, who is an ally 
of Prime Minister Khekmatiar in the war against Kabul, may add 
to the troubles of Russian servicemen. Most likely Dustum will 
begin pushing the detachments of the opposition across the 
border to the Tajik side. As for whether this prediction is 
correct, time will tell. But it mustn't be forgotten that the 
radical faction of the Tajik opposition is supported by the 
Afghan prime minister. 
  On the other hand, Western observers in Tajikistan are not 
prone to exaggerating the scale of the danger from without. They 
feel that the positions of the powers that be may be seriously 
undermined by internal political instability. 
  In the meantime, Russian forces in Tajikistan continue 
suffering losses. A 30-year old private serving under contract 
was shot point blank with an automatic round from a passing 
Zhiguli at a checkpoint of the Kurgan-Tyube regiment. 
  The term of the mandate of peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan 
expires on 15 April. Tajik authorities intend to ask the heads 
of the Central Asian States and Russian to lengthen the term of 
their stay another half-year. Boris Pyankov has no faith in 
contacts with the Tajik armed opposition. The consent given in 
principle by the opposition to negotiations with the authorities 
in Dushanbe appears to be nothing more than a political gesture, 
which would hardly remain viable in the evolving situation. The 
Tajik opposition is heterogeneous. And most likely, Russian 
First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Adamishin was 
able to attract only its moderate faction. 
  The positions of the sides are so far apart that it is hard 
to count on any compromise between them.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel </F>
Ihor Koshel: "The Ministers Liked More Than Just the Lviv 
Weather"] 
  [Text] A press conference was held at the headquarters of 
the Carpathian Military District by Minister of Defense of 
Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and 
Minister of Defense of Belarus Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy. 
The leaders of the military departments, before answering the 
questions of journalists, briefly related the essence of the 
meeting. General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy 
indicated in particular that "I had a planned working meeting 
today with the Minister of Defense of Belarus. We are very 
thankful that the Lviv area has received us with pleasant, sunny 
weather. That fostered a good discussion. We discussed questions 
of the building development of our armed forces, how technical 
and medical support will be organized and how the `Partnership 
for Peace' will be implemented. We also touched on questions of 
regional security. We have many common personnel problems. It is 
well known that many Ukrainians are serving in Belarus, and many 
Belarusians in Ukraine. Some of them want to return home, and we 
must devise mechanisms to solve that problem. A series of 
proposals were thus put forward, and our experts will study 
these problems and prepare certain documents. We will meet again 
in April and make concrete decisions." 
  Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy also expressed his 
impressions of the meeting: "The Lviv weather really did seem to 
incline us toward the fruitful resolution of everything that was 
discussed in today's conversations. We are working today on the 
creation of national armies, and we see that without each 
other's help we will not be able to manage it. 
Military-technical issues are simply not resolved without 
outside help. We agreed on close collaboration back in 
Ashkhabad, and now have met here with our colleagues. I would 
like to add that we do not have sufficient funds in our state 
for the normal development of our armed forces. We want to 
collaborate with our neighbors, with you, in order to ease this 
problem. The concept of barter exists. We have many military 
repair enterprises in Belarus that are of interest to the 
Ukrainian armed forces. You, on the other hand, have things of 
interest to our specialists. We can and should agree to 
advantageous collaboration on the basis of fair transactions." 
  The leaders of the military agencies answered the questions 
of journalists. 
  Question: A representative of the military 
department of Russia, Colonel-General Samsonov, was recently 
saying that combined armed forces of the CIS will possibly be 
appearing before long. Do you share that assertion? 
  The Minister of Defense of Ukraine answered that question: 
"Colonel-General Samsonov can think whatever he likes. It is a 
matter for us to agree with him or not. We cannot take part in 
any military blocs whatsoever, in accordance with our Military 
Doctrine. Much has been written about this in the press. If the 
decision is made by the Supreme Soviet or the President of 
Ukraine on some other type of relations with the armies of other 
countries, we the military will submit to such a decision. We 
still have close collaboration with the armies of our neighbors, 
both near and far. Collaboration such as with Belarus." 
  Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy added to what was said by 
the Minister of Defense of Ukraine: "I asked General Samsonov 
where he got the grounds to make such a statement. The idea of 
combined armed forces was not very promising from the very 
beginning, in my opinion. So another idea has appeared--the 
creation of a staff to coordinate military collaboration, if 
only to assist each other in building national armed forces and 
ease as much as possible the performance of that task. 
  Question: New, Temporary Regulations and other 
official documents are already being developed and taking effect 
in the Ukrainian armed forces. Is anything of the sort being 
planned in the army of Belarus? 
  "I have seen your Temporary Regulations," said 
Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy. "We have also developed our 
own and submitted them for the consideration of the Council of 
Ministers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. I think that 
they will take effect very soon and be translated into the 
Belarusian language." 
  Question: Could you elaborate more concretely on 
the collaboration of our two ministries and armies? 
  "We have a series of projects that have been proposed by the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and our specialists," indicated 
the Minister of Defense of Belarus. "There is, for example, a 
draft program for the training of cadets at higher military 
educational institutions. I think that we will be able to speak 
more concretely about bringing that plan to life in April. We 
also have agreements on the exchange of attendees at military 
educational institutions with Poland, with the military-medicine 
academy in particular. 
  Question: How do you regard the agreement on the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, and what stage is 
that process in? 
  "I think," said Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy, "that the 
decision on how and when to withdraw nuclear weapons from 
Ukraine is an internal matter for the country's leaders. I 
cannot comment on that. We are accomplishing analogous tasks 
ourselves today. Frankly speaking, General of the Army of 
Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and I did not touch on that problem." 
  "This is my second meeting now with Pavlo Kozlovskyy," added 
the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, "and I would like to say 
that I have never asked what Belarus is doing with regard to 
nuclear weapons, and he in turn has not inquired into what 
Ukraine is doing. 
  "What stage do I think this problem is at? If we want to 
become a non-nuclear state, then everything that is being done 
now is a normal and natural process. And it is being done in 
accordance with an existing document. There is a schedule, 
agreed on with Russia, and we are fulfilling it. It cannot be 
stated concretely yet when the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
will begin and when it will end. One must understand that it is 
not just simple freight being shipped. The utmost assurance of 
safety is required here, and that requires painstaking 
preparations of transport, railroad tracks, the appropriate 
documents and the like. The work is proceeding, however."
