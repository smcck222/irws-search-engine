<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Lebed, commanding General of the </F>
14th Russian Army, by D. Mosiyenko and R. Khotin, IMA Press, 
special for LITERATURNAYA GAZETA; place and date not given: 
"The Dniester Region Could Become a Second Yugoslavia, Thinks 
Aleksandr Lebed, Commanding General of the 14th Russian Army"] 
  [Text] [Question] On the eve of the parliamentary 
elections in Moldova, President Mircea Snegur announced that he 
will insist on the complete withdrawal of your army from the 
Dniester region in 1994. What do you think about this? 
  [Lebed] As the saying goes, there is desire, and there are 
possibilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the 
troops of one state are on the territory of another one, I 
answer: It is bad. Must they be withdrawn? Yes, they must. 
When, is a separate question. When will the economic and 
political conditions be created under which it will be possible 
to dispatch trains here for the redeployment of subunits, and so 
that local women do not assault our units, as happened 
previously... These conditions do not exist now: One and a 
half years of peace did not produce anything, negotiations 
between the sides in the conflict are not being conducted, and, 
unfortunately, no political settlement is being looked into yet. 
As for the economic conditions--well, troops have already been 
withdrawn from Georgia and other republics, as a result of which 
a hundred thousand officers and warrant officers are dangling 
between heaven and earth without work, without apartments, and 
without prospects. This is no longer acceptable, and no one 
will support this in the future. Diplomatic problems also 
exist. How, for example, will Ukraine see it if I start to 
transport weapons and ammunition through it? After all, its 
railroads will be overloaded, and, indeed, the freight, to put 
it mildly, is not safe. There is also a technical side to the 
matter. Taking into account the existing rail lines, loading 
platforms, and the number of weapons, the redeployment will take 
two years. This is if there is an uninterrupted pullout--night 
and day, summer and winter, on workdays and holidays... How can 
there be any talk of 1994? 
  To utilize ammunition here is also unrealistic. But now the 
game is one-sided--leave, and that is all. 
  [Question] Some politicians, in particular Bundestag Deputy 
Brigitte Schulte, the leader of the NATO group of observers at 
the elections in Moldova, believe that the presence of the 14th 
Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's 
participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  [Lebed] For me, this German woman is not an authority and, 
indeed, women have nothing to do here in general. Let her come 
and try to withdraw this army from here. The former Soviet 
troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave and, 
afterwards, following the division of the Union, the second 
started. The Western Group of Forces left Germany and the 
Northwestern left the Baltics. This entire mass of officers, 
warrant officers, military equipment, and preposterous 
apartmentless servicemen... The economic situation in Russia 
and Ukraine is now such that it is impossible to solve the 
present problem quickly. But since this is the case, it has to 
be resolved in a humane way. When the question of the 
withdrawal of the British Army of the Rhine from the FRG arose 
two years ago, the English calculated that it would take nine 
years. The Germans checked it out--yes, precisely so. This is 
the civilized approach. 
  [Question] Who in the future could take the place of the 
14th Army? Perhaps the UN "blue helmets?" 
  [Lebed] Let us agree that not long ago we were citizens of 
one country and that we will come to an understanding between 
ourselves quicker and easier than the Americans, Germans, and 
English. There are, for example, trilateral peacekeeping posts 
of Russians, Dniester region people, and Moldovans. There are 
no interethnic problems among them. And the military commanders 
know each other, inasmuch as they served in the same army at one 
time. A certain military-political balance of forces has 
developed in this region. If it is now crudely violated in a 
unilateral way... Let us imagine that our army is not here 
tomorrow--immediately the temptation arises to resolve in one 
leap and in two hours a problem that set teeth on edge a long 
time ago. Someone will fill this vacuum. Imagine there is a 
leap, but victory is not achieved, and a long conflict ensues; 
but this place is smart, and everyone owes something to everyone 
else. The map of Europe was redrawn more than once according to 
the results achieved by the victorious soldiers of one side or 
the other. In the Dniester-Moldovan conflict it can be proven 
that white is white and black at the same time, only in one case 
it is necessary to get documents from the 18th century, and in 
the other, the 19th century. Therefore, this may be a second 
Yugoslavia. A lot of sound thought has to be put in before 
disrupting this balance. I personally cannot yet conceive of 
how to withdraw the subunits entrusted to me from here. Even if 
tomorrow someone else is its commander, he also will be unable 
to do this. The people are not chasing the army from the 
Dniester region--on the contrary, they are holding on to it. 
  Because troops were pulled out of the far abroad in a 
disgraceful record-breaking timeframe, complicated tasks came up 
frequently: For example, disband a division in two months. And 
then the question arose: Where is your place of birth? If you 
are from Tiraspol, let us send you, lad, to the commanding 
general of the 14th Army, and he will find you a place. As a 
result, 51 percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant 
officers I now have were born in this region. Everything got 
mixed up in the home of the Oblonskiy: The Army is Russian, the 
last name of the commander is Lebed, his combat deputy is 
Melnichuk, armaments deputy--Dymar, rear services-- Perepadya, 
and the relatives of all of them are more often than not in 
Ukraine. But on the whole all this is gibberish that must be 
stopped as quickly as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, 
Belarusians-- all are Slavs, people of one destiny and blood, 
and one faith. We have to think about not what disunites us but 
about what unites us. But we are divided like Siamese twins that 
have two heads and one body. If they are separated, you get a 
hybrid from either one of 
them. Well, we are now working on hybrids. 
  [Question] What are relations like between the command 
authorities of the Army and the Dniester region leadership? 
  [Lebed] They were never simple. The Tiraspol leaders 
introduced idiotic money (rubles before 1992 with a stamp 
depicting Suvorov and a face value), they are poking their nose 
into other people's affairs, having sent hundreds of assault 
rifles in October to the White House. They are making decisions 
on some kind of citizenship, they are introducing outlandish 
legislation, they have privatized 30 kilometers of the Russian 
pipeline that goes through the territory of the Dniester region, 
and they have taken jurisdiction of the air space over the 
Dniester-Moldovan Republic, while possessing no airport or 
aircraft. I resigned my commission as a Dniester region deputy, 
inasmuch as I am categorically against the rude interference in 
the internal affairs of the state and in the army that I serve. 
The kind of president and the kind of parliament to have is 
Russia's affair. The Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents are 
irrelevant here.

<F P=106> [News conference held by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk </F>
and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at Yavor Military 
Training Ground, Carpathian Military District, Lvov Oblast on 23 
March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Kravchuk] I will not make an introductory 
speech. I know, as do you, that every article or every literary 
work has three components: Real life, man's ability to embrace 
it spiritually, and a little bit of imagination. These three 
components constitute some material -- a book, an article or a 
report. 
  I would like us to center our talk today around the issue 
which has been taking place in front of us and also around those 
issues which are of interest to you. You are welcome. 
  [Unidentified conference mediator] Ukrainian television. You 
are welcome. 
  [Ukrainian television correspondent] Mr. Supreme Commander, 
President of Ukraine, esteemed Leonid Makarovych. We proceed 
from the principle of reasonable sufficiency in building the 
Armed Forces of the independent Ukrainian state. Today we saw 
quite serious exercises. Could you assess these exercises from 
the point of view of today and from the point of view of 
building our state in future? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Of course, the building, creation, the 
restructuring of the armed forces of Ukraine.... [pauses] We 
have completed the stage of restructuring the armed forces and 
now we have to adapt them to realities which exist, to our 
internal and external problems. And the main task of the Armed 
Forces is to defend the state, to ensure peaceful work of the 
people. This is a priority. And, of course, we have satisfied 
ourselves that we have gone through those stages, we have gone 
through them peacefully, without conflicts and today we have 
armed forces which are capable, I emphasize this, of ensuring 
the tasks they are facing. 
  This does not mean in the least that we have no problems. 
There are problems of logistical support, military training, 
the future of our armed forces, equipping them, their prospects 
for the future, and so on. But there is only one conclusion: 
The Armed Forces do exist and today the officers, generals, and 
soldiers demonstrated their ability to fulfill the most 
complicated tasks. And I am satisfied with the fact that 
everything was taking place synchronously, according to plan; 
there have been no emergencies, as they say, and we are 
satisfied that these exercises have taken place. They were 
necessary. Strictly speaking, these were the first exercises 
since our Ukrainian Armed Forces have been in existence. And 
people must undergo training so as to be able to defend their 
state and their people. 
  [Mediator] (?Halychyna Film), please. 
  [(?Halychyna Film) correspondent] Esteemed Mr. President, 
esteemed Commander-in-Chief, this is the question of interest to 
us: What was the army you dreamt about and how are these plans 
being put into practice? 
  [Kravchuk] First and foremost, we have been dreaming about 
the army which any nation and any state can dream of if it set a 
goal and this goal is concentrated not only in the people's 
wish, which is quite understandable, but in the conceptual 
principles of our enactments. We have a military doctrine, a 
concept, we have enactments on the organization and formation of 
the Armed Forces, and those Armed Forces which we have today 
comply with the principles which were approved by the Supreme 
Council and by the president's decree and which meet our 
possibilities. We must have armed forces for peaceful work. 
Neither in our doctrine nor in our concept are we setting or 
have been setting any tasks whatsoever as far as, for example, 
any aggressive aspirations or other such tasks before our Armed 
Forces. The only tasks are to defend people's peaceful work, 
build an independent state and ensure the fulfillment of these 
most important priority tasks. 
  [Mediator] UKRINFORM's Demydenko, please. 
  [UKRINFORM correspondent Demydenko] Esteemed Leonid 
Makarovych, by now the people of Ukraine have grown accustomed 
to seeing you in your capacity as the president and to the 
actions you take as those of the president. Today, you acted as 
commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. How did it 
feel? What were you thinking about? 
  [Kravchuk] (?Since) I only took part in the exercise, I 
believe it was primarily the commander who had the greatest 
degree of responsibility. It was the commander of the 
Subcarpathian military district, Colonel-General (Bobkov), and 
our defense minister, Army General Radetskyy, and all those in 
the military who supported, planned, drew maps, and marched 
every inch of that ground in order for everything to take place 
as planned. This was their supreme responsibility. 
  When I came here, my aim was to see what we had done in 
these 
years to build our own Armed Forces. I can say without 
exaggeration that a lot has been done and not only with regard 
to form but also content. Today you heard and saw before your 
very eyes how this action took place. You heard the Ukrainian 
state language. You saw the Ukrainian insignia. You finally 
saw the substance and spiritual structure of our soldiers, 
officers, generals, and commanders of all ranks. This is what 
is most important. A new state is in the making and its own 
Armed Forces are following a parallel course with its 
difficulties and complexities. Hoping, however, that maybe the 
time will come when this... [pauses] or it was easy for someone, 
is unrealistic. [sentence as heard] 
  [Mediator] Please. 
  [KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent Yuriy Kvit] Leonid 
Makarovych, please forgive me (?in advance) if the nature of my 
question is not quite appropriate in the current atmosphere. I 
believe, however, the people of Ukraine will ask and be 
concerned about these questions. Do you know that this event of 
ours cost (?the Defense Ministry) a great deal. Preliminary 
estimates show it was somewhere in the region of over 40 billion 
karbovantsi. Do you know that the period (?of preparation), 
that as far as I know was protracted, when the training ground, 
understandably, was being made quite ready for this event, cost 
very much too. Barracks repair and other work was done. In 
short, forgive me, an awful lot was spent (?in our time of 
poverty). At the same time, the military district's catering 
service alone owes around 200 billion karbovantsi for food 
(?allocated to) the district, and many of the district's 
servicemen have not been paid for March yet. So do you think 
this great expenditure was worth what we hoped for and what we 
saw today? Is there a ratio, a balance in it? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, all of you may know this saying and know to 
whom it belongs: He who does not want to feed his own army, will 
feed someone else's tomorrow. I would like to say this: If 
there are armed forces which cost a state a great deal of money 
indeed -- be it even not the amounts that you cited; and 
although I do not know these figures they can gernerally be 
specified with regard to the whole of Ukraine's Armed Forces -- 
if these armed forces do not train, they are useless altogether. 
Following your logic, then, we would have to disarm altogether 
and, generally, include a some armed forces in, shall we say, 
the formations that would not even cost 40 billion karbovantsi 
but a little bit less and generally delete the protection of the 
state from our agenda altogether, simply delete it. 
  The thing is, I know that with regard to this -- and not 
only 
with regard to this -- no sooner is something more or less 
large-scale begun, than someone starts to talk about how much it 
costs and whether it would not be better in our difficult 
situation, let us say, to pay wages with these funds. It is 
logical. 
  But today you pay wages to the people of an independent 
state 
and without the Armed Forces, tomorrow other states will come 
and have these people, currently working for an independent 
state, work for another state. No one will then calculate this 
expenditure. It will then be a quite different situation. 
  I am not saying that people's life today is good. Nor am I 
saying they are able to maintain a large army. But should the 
question be raised of today's difficulties and should nothing be 
done and should everything be reduced to only the minimum, shall 
we say, for the people somehow just to survive and, shall we 
say, have more on the table today -- to put it conventionally, 
150 grams of meat rather than 100 grams -- there may not even be 
this tomorrow. 
  In other words, I would not like to reduce everything in 
this 
case to a specific exercise. There is strategy and there are 
tactics. If we have our Armed Forces and have our army, they 
either have to train and be ready to protect us or they should 
not be there at all. If you proceed from this, you will think 
quite differently. It is exactly the way I think, because the 
Armed Forces cost us trillions rather than billions. So why 
should we spend those trillions if we know that those armed 
forces will be unable to protect the state. And if they are to 
protect us, they have to know how to do this. 
  [Mediator] Oksana Telentsiy, HOLOS UKRAYINY. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Telentsiy] Esteemed Mr. 
President, I happened to hear today that the excellent machinery 
that we can see [words indistinct]. (?What is) the future of our 
military industrial complex in Ukraine under conditions of the 
acute economic crisis? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] The machinery that was moving in this beautiful 
area of our land in most cases is manufactured here in Ukraine, 
in most cases. They are tanks, self-propelled and other systems. 
Of course, they are assembled from parts that we either buy or 
receive from other states of the former Soviet Union. We can, 
however, make them ourselves. We have marvellous opportunities 
to build cargo aviation. True, we have difficulties, shall we 
say, with manufacturing high- speed aviation, fighter and other 
aircraft. But to say that this is the remainder of [USSR] luxury 
is maybe too early. We have an appropriate program for the 
military industrial complex to develop. The development of 
weaponry of our own has good prospects. We have appropriate 
scientific laboratories, institutes, forces, and key personnel 
who are at work and quite seriously at work too. But a 
predicament is a predicament. I absolutely agree with you that 
we today cannot ensure this is the way we would like it to be 
done; true, we cannot do it. 
  [Mediator] REUTER, please. 
  [REUTER correspondent] Mr. President, (?you will agree that) 
until recently, the parliament of Ukraine could not determine 
its position on the START I Treaty. (?As interpreted) in 
particular by Russia, Ukraine was blocking the Russo-American 
START II treaty. How do you see the situation now? Is Ukraine 
still (?obstructing it) or not? And the second question is 
this: Do you forecast any problems of the kind you had with 
parliament with regard to nuclear weapons for Boris Yeltsin with 
his parliament [words indistinct] the START II Treaty which 
[words indistinct] provides for a large reduction in nuclear 
weapons? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, START II in this case has no direct 
bearing on Ukraine. Having signed the trilateral agreement in 
Moscow and accords following it, we -- our parliament -- have 
determined our attitude towards Ukraine's position expressly and 
clearly. The latter now is a problem that goes beyond our 
state's boundaries. As a state, however, that had nuclear 
weapons, on whose territory there were nuclear weapons, who set 
itself the task of their elimination and which determined its 
position on this expressly and clearly, of course Ukraine will 
accordingly stimulate other states' actions and policies so that 
the world's nuclear weapons are destroyed altogether. This is 
our position which we shall uphold. As a member of the United 
Nations Organization and a member state of appropriate European 
structures; we shall do everything to achieve this end and shall 
not obstruct it because this is our position of principle. 
  [Mediator] MOLOD UKRAYINY, please. 
  [MOLOD UKRAYINY correspondent (?Volodymyr) Brazan] [Words 
indistinct] the Ukrainian (?army's high morale). But are you, Mr 
President, not (?concerned) about another question? When 
settling the Crimean issue, for example, and you having to use 
force, will our state be able to rely on the Russian-speaking 
Ukrainian Army? 
  [Kravchuk] To begin with, I do not know what 
Russian-speaking 
means. We have Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian, and other 
people populating Ukraine. It is multinational. What language a 
person communicates in does not determine, shall we say, their 
spiritual essence and their position. 
  That is why, this thesis of the Russian-speaking population 
should be withdrawn as groundless philosophically, historically, 
or otherwise. It was invented by someone and it seems to me it 
was invented by politicians in Russia in order to protect, as it 
were, the so-called Russian-speaking population. What this is, 
I do not know. There is no such notion. There is nationality 
rather than language. 
  So, firstly, I do not want to make a division thus. 
Secondly, 
I believe and hope that we shall not have to use our armed 
forces in Crimea. At any rate, we shall never take the 
initiative. We hope we shall settle this issue peacefully; shall 
settle it by way of negotiations, including with those states -- 
or primarily Russia -- which have certain interests there. 
  I do not want any thoughts to remain incomplete. One thing 
is clear to me: that Russian mentality, the Russian elite, 
both political -- and not only political but the literary and 
spiritual as well -- will never put up with the fact that Crimea 
does not belong to Russia; never. And the policy will be shaped 
correspondingly. However, to put up with this, that is to say, 
to bear this in one's heart and to have the forms of action are 
quite different things. I believe that there will be enough 
common sense, in any case, that high-ranking politicians will 
have enough common sense, and it is they who determine policy 
today, but not those political forces and trends which exist 
today here and there and everywhere. 
  This is the first thing. Secondly. I understand, for 
example, the policy immediately related to Crimea and inside 
Crimea. Well, Crimea's drifting can be either speedy or 
evolutionary, but the drifting... [pauses] in view of the fact 
that the Russian population is the majority and that there is 
interest in Russia, this... [pauses] No matter what happens to 
Crimea, whether it becomes an oblast or a republic -- they 
believe if it were an oblast it would be easier to cope with 
problems and if it were a republic it would be more difficult. 
All these are illusions. The drifting results from the very 
composition and the fear -- the fear, I underline this -- that 
the Ukrainian state, having embarked on so-called nationalist 
course, will, so to say, lead to the elimination of Russian 
spirituality, Russian spirit, traditions and culture in Crimea. 
  But how to do this? For example, to set a course now so that 
this would be done from inside Crimea. They say that some 
actions will be carried out there so that Crimea will be further 
alienating itself from Ukraine and approaching its statehood, as 
the first step, so as to conceal the genuine objectives, and 
then, when there is a possibility to conclude treaties, the 
treaty on accession to Russia will be concluded. This is the 
policy of Crimea itself. 
  What is Ukraine's policy? Ukraine is conducting the 
following policy: To vest the broadest, the greatest possible 
economic and other socioeconomic plenary powers in Crimea, the 
rights to tackle all the socioeconomic problems facing Crimea 
using the possibilities of this region, its resources and 
specific features. The broadest possible rights. And this is 
already a fact of life that we have agreed to this. This refers 
both to the budget and other things. But we are saying sincerely 
and frankly that we shall never conduct any negotiations with 
anyone as regards the political status and territorial integrity 
of our Ukraine, for example, and as regards Crimea. 
  [Kravchuk continues] What is the current situation in the 
world? I would like you to understand this, that the situation 
in the world now is in Ukraine's favor. That both the European 
states and the United States of America officially underlined 
that they respect and that they will support everywhere 
Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and 
inviolability of its borders. Believe me, this is extremely 
significant. 
  Way back when the former parliament of Russia took a 
decision 
on the status of Sevastopol you probably felt that the Security 
Council responded instantly. That is to say, it is impossible 
to tackle issues in Crimea today without taking into account 
Ukraine's weight, its role and the prestige it gained, both 
political and otherwise, and its potentials. One cannot tackle 
these issues, I repeat this, without taking this into account. 
This exactly is what we proceed from. 
  In other words, we shall strive for mutual interaction with 
all forces. We would like to take into account the interests, I 
emphasize this, in this region and the interests of Russia. Our 
attitude toward policy is realistic and we do not want, let us 
say, to think that this is the matter of concern for one state 
only. At present the interests of many are interlaced there. 
We would like to take this into account and we shall propose 
how to do this. However, to raise questions about any political 
changes, about territorial or any other changes, this will never 
be allowed to happen -- never. I would like everyone to be 
aware of this. Territorial integrity, sovereignty, and 
independence are the bounds for policy, the bounds beyond which 
no one will make any steps. The one who will make them has no 
right to respect himself and he cannot be considered to be a 
politician. Everyone must be aware of this. And we shall never 
allow anyone to go beyond these bounds. We ourselves do not 
pass them and we shall not allow anyone to do this. We shall be 
defending these bounds. 
  [Mediator] Mykhaylo Soroka, URYADOVYY KURYER. 
  [URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, [words 
indistinct] prior to your visit this morning to the Lvov region, 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry had departed from Kiev. 
What are the main results of his visit to Ukraine that you 
could emphasize, and will the Ukrainian-American dialogue 
continue? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, to begin with, Secretary Perry came on the 
instruction of United States of America President Clinton, to 
fulfill the accords signed by us in Washington. I can say that 
the negotiations held were interesting, constructive, and 
fruitful. Not only were all the Washington ideas were realized 
in Kiev, but also something in addition to them. We agreed and 
signed documents on increasing servicemen's housing construction 
funds and social security, which will become a reality in the 
very near future and will be done. More money was given to 
conversion and other purposes relating to the elimination of our 
nuclear weapons. We placed the main emphasis, however, on how 
the officers and servicemen who serve in the army, will be 
provided for socially at present. 
  Secondly, the delegation's composition was rather 
wide-ranging. There were, you see, rocket technology specialists 
there and there were negotiations in connection with possible 
civilian use of our rocket technology. There were conversion 
specialists and professionals who will immediately deal with the 
verification of nuclear weapons elimination. This was a 
representative delegation dealing with everything ranging from 
the armed forces to space. On each of these issues, we made an 
important step forward. 
  [Mediator] Another question please. 
  [UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Ivakhnenko] It has become 
known from unofficial information that the Russian side has 
refused to form a commission which would begin an inventory of 
the Black Sea Fleet jointly with the Ukrainian side. What is 
your vision of a settlement to the Black Sea Fleet issue on the 
eve of another round of talks with Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] I can say that to date there is Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin's instruction to form such a commission 
for it to start working. There are problems. I have no precise 
information about who it was who refused. The only thing that I 
do know is that there is no other decision by the head of the 
Russian Government. So if there are any problems, I hope they 
will be resolved. If this was not done on 15 March it can be 
done on 10 April. One cannot, however, say that this issue was 
struck out from the agenda altogether. 
  [Mediator] Your question please. 
  [UkrKinoKhronika studio correspondent, name indistinct] I 
have a question for Mr. Radetskyy. Do you find today's 
exercises successful and do you think it worthwhile for the 
Ukrainian artillerymen to have shelled a church at the firing 
range given that the issue of religion is so complex now in 
Ukraine? 
  [Radetskyy] Firstly, yes, the exercises that were held 
today, 
indeed, were expedient. This should be done. The president as 
the commander-in-chief has already stated this to you today. 
  Secondly, no artillery, by the way, shelled the church 
because, all precautions taken, artillery fires shells from the 
flanks rather than over the heads of the forces on the offensive. 
  Thirdly, we known very well the remarkable history of this 
firing range. I know Mala Vishenka and Velyka Vishenka (?which 
used to be there). Today, incidentally, we jointly with the 
Lviv region administration dealt with this problem. So I think 
everything is normal and natural and what had been planned was 
fulfilled under the plan. I do not understand your question: 
What does this church have to do with it? No one, incidentally, 
fired at it, not even soldiers from their automatic rifles. 
And, by the way, no one has been shelling it since 1980, no. 
No one has been shelling it since 1980; the people's eyes have 
opened. 
  [Kravchuk] The only thing I would like to add is this: Since 
1917, not only this church but all the churches on our soil, and 
not only the churches but also the people who believed, believe, 
and will believe in God, have been so shelled verbally and their 
soul so ruined that this church is like a silent witness to what 
has been done. The people, you see, have already understood it 
themselves, as the minister said. One cannot do this to the 
people, the fruit of their labor and their belief. It is 
improper. 
  That it has been understood is good. Of course it has so 
happened that it has taken place and there is this firing range. 
But what can be done now? We cannot, after all, shut it down, 
because colossal means and resources have been invested here and 
it is needed. It is needed in order to train and practice the 
skillfulness of our armed forces. 
  [Correspondent] How well are the Ukrainian troops prepared 
to 
take part in the Partnership for Peace program and joint 
military exercises? 
  [Kravchuk] Partnership for Peace does not foresee the 
participation of Ukrainian troops, because it is a partnership 
for peace. [sentence as heard] There is another clause there, a 
clause saying that during NATO military exercises, our units and 
troops could, with our consent, participate, in order to 
practice certain models for themselves, not to take part in any 
possible military action. That is impossible. We are taking 
part in the action in Yugoslavia, with our battalion, which is 
involved there in order to ensure normal life, and only that. 
This is agreed with the UN Security Council. Therefore, some 
unit could, with our consent and the consent of the relevant 
NATO structure, take part in joint military exercises, but not 
more. This does not imply our interaction with NATO troops, 
because we are not a member of NATO. 
  [Moderator] Mykola Yurchyshyn, SILSKI VISTI, please. 
  [SILSKI VISTI correspondent Yurchyshyn] Esteemed Mr. 
President, is there an alternative military service in Ukraine? 
According to the law, there should be one. 
  [Kravchuk] What alternative service? 
  [Radetskyy] This is laid down in the law, and the law should 
be adhered to. Incidentally, there are very few objectors, 
those who refuse to carry arms, in Ukraine today. These include 
sick people or those who belong to religious movements. We are 
solving these problems and we are working on them. Moreover, 
the law speaks not only of alternative service, but also about 
contract service which we also plan to practice in future, as 
right now there is no money to maintain a professional army, 
although, it would in fact pay off and would be cheaper for 
Ukraine to maintain than these boys we are drafting for a year 
and a half, who are wrecking everything and for whom this time 
is too short to embrace the material they are to study. 
  [SHLYAKH PEREMOHY correspondent] I have two questions, if I 
may. The first one is this: The president of Ukraine is at the 
same time the commander-in-chief. But we now have another 
president, the Crimean one. Are you going to share any powers 
of the commander-in-chief with him? [Kravchuk and Radetskyy are 
heard laughing] My second question concerns the Defense Council 
of Crimea which has been set up there. Is it a state structure, 
if yes, what functions has it been charged to perform? 
  [Kravchuk] This follows from your first question about 
Crimea, and I will answer it more broadly. There are a few 
aspects that probably need clarification. There is Ukraine's 
legislation, its Constitution and laws, and there is the law on 
delimiting powers between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. 
These laws exist and according to these laws, the Crimean 
president cannot -- being absolutely governed by the legislation 
-- shall we say, command, influence or regulate any forces. 
This is the prerogative of the Ukrainian president only. Nor 
can he, let us say, under our Constitution have any military 
structures. Moreover, our law, our legislation does not allow 
military formations that are not provided for in our 
legislation. This not only applies to Crimea but to everyone 
and everywhere. 
  Thus, what is being done, even if it is only beginning to be 
done, is unconstitutional and unlawful and we shall be bringing 
everything in Crimea in line with the legislation. 
  [Radetskyy] Can I answer? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, you're welcome to. 
  [Radetskyy] As for the question on the Crimean Defense 
Council, the only council we have is Ukraine's Defense Council. 
I know of no such council as the Crimean Defense Council. This 
is an invention. By the way, the Odessa military district 
commander and the 32nd Army Corps commander are present here 
today, who strictly perform their duties within the framework of 
those entrusted to them by the Defense Council of Ukraine. 
There is and there will be no other council. 
  [Kravchuk] So, we shall execute the Constitution and laws of 
Ukraine, and any statements that there is no need for the 
Ukrainian Army in Crimea and such like, are groundless 
legislatively and have no foundation except for ambitions and 
wishes. That is why they are not not the basis for practical 
moves. I have instructed Ukraine's appropriate services so as 
for them to work and bring everything in line with the 
legislation. 
  By the way, you see, no matter how agitated they were and no 
matter how insistent they were on a referendum or a poll, 
everything boiled down to a poll to be conducted by the 
president. Crimea's Central Electoral Commission has refused to 
conduct this poll. All it is doing is to provide the premises 
and hand out the ballot papers. It will neither calculate nor 
count or make conclusions on this poll. The poll in Crimea, 
strictly in legal terms, thus amounts to an opinion poll by the 
presidential team. You know, there is no such thing anywhere, 
either in the laws or the Constitution. Anyone can conduct such 
a poll, including the president. In this case, however, it is 
not legitimate as it even is conducted without commissions or 
any legalization by, shall we say, a legitimate body. This is 
being done by certain officials authorized by the president. 
This he can do and I am calm about this, because any analysis 
[pauses] -- I do not know to what degree it will be legalized, 
how its authenticity can be verified and so on. So what 
conclusions will be drawn from this? None. There simply will be 
expenditure. That is all. 
  [Mediator] Questions are welcome. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Defense Ministry's TV. I 
have a question on armed forces reduction and how it will affect 
state security. 
  [Kravchuk] We have to have sufficiency in our defense 
capability and to do so our armed forces have to be sufficient, 
as it were. There are materials providing for their numerical 
strength, which is 450,000 for the armed forces at this stage. 
We shall approach this and then see what the situation is and 
what the quality of our armed forces is, because, shall we say, 
if they are to be professional armed forces, probably -- we 
shall also settle this issue in due time -- a different type of 
expenditure, a different type of weaponry and a different number 
of men will be involved. Meanwhile, we shall act in accordance 
with our military doctrine approved by the Supreme Council. 
  [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, can I add something? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, you are welcome to. 
  [Radetskyy] The Defense Council, by the way, has held a 
sitting and you tasked me with clarifying it. The thing is that 
this numerical strength of 450,000 is as of 31 December 1994, 
while you assigned the task of examining this issue and reducing 
it to 420,000. There is such an instruction from the president 
and we are dealing with this. 
  [Kravchuk] This is not, shall we say, a magic number we have 
to hang on to. Firstly, it is the quality of weaponry, the 
quality of armed forces training, the situation outside the 
country and the international and domestic situation, that will 
dictate the numerical strength and quality of our armed forces, 
rather than simply, shall we say, recording it in writing and 
hanging on to this number. 
  [Radetskyy] (?Including) materials and machinery provision. 
  [Kravchuk] That is right. 
  [Lvov television correspondent] Mr. President, due to 
certain 
circumstances we have two military districts, the powerful 
Precarpathia and Odessa districts. Could you say, please, if 
there is an opinion that the eastern part of the country remains 
as if unprotected, as if there is no mighty force guarding the 
borders there. 
  [Kravchuk] No, this is not the case. There is the Odessa 
military district there. We have appropriate structures. We 
also have the National Guard which performs its functions and 
which, by the way, actively participated today. The National 
Guard commander is present. So, in other words, we have the 
appropriate armed forces and appropriate military structures 
etcetera, shall we say, of all ranks to ensure the tasks set by 
the Ukrainian state are performed. 
  The only thing I would just like us to proceed from, is 
this: 
We are not training ourselves to make war. We are training 
ourselves to protect ourselves, which is our concept of 
principle. We are not and shall not be first to raise our hand 
against anyone, God forbid. Ukraine is a peaceful state and, 
incidentally, it has always been peaceful. It has not been at 
war with anyone. We do not have any territorial claims against 
anyone. In our policy and our statements, we have never 
expressed even a hint that we have some claims to someone, be it 
our neighbors near or far, no. We say [pauses] -- this is what 
we state. But we, at the same time, say we do not want anyone 
to have any such claims against us. Should there be any, 
however -- and there are some let us not pretend there are not 
-- we shall show we shall protect our interests. 
  If anyone tries -- [pauses] not by means of established 
international principles which, by the way, have been worked out 
in detail both in the Helsinki process and at the United Nations 
Organization, worked out in detail, and the world [pauses] -- 
this is the most sensitive issue: Why is the world so sensitive 
when someone violates this? Because here lies that most 
dreadful line between peace and war. 
  Therefore, we say that we shall not make even a single step 
to cross this line. But the one who will do this not by means 
of those established norms existing in the world but who will 
try to do this by means of force, it is clear that it will be 
countered by force. There is no other option. 
  [Radetskyy] Leonid Makarovych, the esteemed gentleman who 
put 
this question had in mind not only this but also the fact that 
the Odessa district is so large while the Precarpathian district 
is so small. And this issue was already touched upon [word 
indistinct]. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, we are currently working out our structure. 
  [Radetskyy] Territorially. 
  [Kravchuk] We are working it out. For example, there were 
staff exercises and they have been held for two weeks. Is that 
right? 
  [Radetskyy] They are still in progress. 
  [Kravchuk] Then I will continue to analyze. There, at the 
exercises, we were talking about how to build our territorial 
defense so that it would be adequate to the situation. And this 
will be changed. And, again, this is not something established 
once and forever, but this is a process. 
  [Radetskyy] I would like to explain as a military expert 
that 
the question is not how many troops there are in a military 
district, but what these troops are, what their mobility is 
like, what their combat readiness is like, so that we could, in 
any location where our security is being threatened, concentrate 
these forces in order to solve the problem by means of a 
political dialogue, not by force. We should create formation in 
that location so that those threatening us would give up trying 
to fight against us but would solve the conflict in a political 
way. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent from NARODNA ARMIYA] Leonid Makarovych, these 
are the first exercises held after the Army General of Ukraine 
Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy was appointed Ukraine's Defense 
Minister. Today [word indistinct] not only the combat activity 
of the troops but also Vitaliy Hryhorovych were assessed. 
  [Kravchuk] You know, when Vitaliy Hryhorovych took the post, 
he got down to practical deeds. He is an experienced person who 
made a career, in different places, as they say, and at 
different posts, from a platoon commander to the minister. He 
knows all the ticks and hooks which they draw on maps and which 
they dig in the earth. He knows where one should stand and what 
one should do, and he himself can replace a company, platoon, 
regiment, battalion, division, or district commander. He is a 
genuine minister. A person who has not gone through all this 
will experience difficulties. This is why I appreciate his 
experience. This is the first thing. 
  Secondly, he is a person who wants that the armed forces be 
functioning as a clockwork mechanism and who knows what is to be 
done toward that end. He is a man of responsibility. 
  I know that here, especially on the land of Galicia, there 
is 
much talk about the former minister, Mr. Morozov. He initiated 
and applied certain efforts so that we could have our armed 
forces. And no one can deny this fact. But it turned out so 
that [pauses] -- one can only do what he is able to do. And one 
will never do more than that. He did what he could do. Being 
aware of the fact that this post is rather serious and has a lot 
of trends and philosophical and political interpretations around 
it, we were doing everything possible to preserve the status 
quo, although it was not easy to do this. And no one should be 
blamed. However, the situation, both in the center and in the 
regions, and in the troops -- I know this -- was such that this 
issue had to be solved. And then the minister knew this from 
the conversation he had with me. Despite the fact that I, 
nevertheless, submitted his candidacy to parliament, he came and 
asked that his candidacy be withdrawn.

<F P=106> [Statement of the Press Service of the Ministry of Defense </F>
of Ukraine] 
  [Text] Russia's mass media, and in particular 
Interfax and the newspaper Sedognya, have recently 
been circulating reports about transports of nuclear warheads 
leaving the territory of Ukraine to be handed over to the 
Russian side in accordance with the international and legal 
commitments assumed by Ukraine. In so doing, they also make 
public information that is of a strictly confidential nature, 
citing "informed sources in the Ministry of Defense of the 
Russian Federation." 
  The ease with which some journalists, citing Russian 
military 
sources, are publicizing information about the timetables, 
dates, and destinations of the transports of nuclear ammunition 
is astonishing; especially as the Russian specialists cannot 
help but be aware that such actions create a real threat to the 
security of transporting nuclear warheads. 
  Apparently, certain circles in Russia are interested in 
slowing down or even bringing to a total halt the planned 
removal of nuclear armaments from the territory of Ukraine. 
Obviously, were this to happen, Ukraine would again be accused 
of exhibiting a lack of good faith and obstructing the process 
of nuclear disarmament. 
  The Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
hereby declares that such actions are provocatory and 
intolerable, inasmuch as their aim is to turn up the tension 
surrounding Ukraine's nuclear disarmament a notch higher. 
  Ukraine remains faithful to her commitment to remove nuclear 
weapons from her territory. The specialists responsible for the 
security of these transports are taking all the necessary steps 
to safeguard this process from any unexpected eventualities. 
  At the same time, because of the indiscretion of Russia's 
"informed sources," Ukraine is now forced to take additional 
steps to alter the exact schedule and routes for transporting 
nuclear warheads.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko under "Ukraine" rubric: "There </F>
Is Simply Ukraine; The Former Minister of Defense Criticizes the 
Policies of Official Kiev"] 
  [Text] The round table on the problems of the national 
security and military policy of Ukraine that was prepared by the 
"Elections-94" press center essentially turned into a press 
conference for one of the candidates for people's deputy, former 
Minister of Defense Colonel-General Konstantin Morozov, whose 
ratings are rather high after he left his post on account of 
disagreement with President Leonid Kravchuk on many questions of 
current interest. 
  In responding to the question of Russia's claims to a 
special 
role in the post-Union territory, Konstantin Morozov declared 
that Moscow has no basis for this and, moreover, without the 
sanction of the UN cannot perform the role of peacemaker 
utilizing its armed forces. In the words of Konstantin Morozov, 
the military conflict in the Dniester Region arose largely 
precisely because of the presence of the 14th Russian Army there 
and "they drew Georgia into the CIS because of a military 
conflict." Konstantin Morozov declared that he supports the 
demand for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from 
foreign territories and that in his possible action as a deputy 
he will never allow Ukrainian forces to participate in 
operations in hot spots without UN permission. And in general, 
with respect to the resolution of the delicate problems in 
interrelations between former allied republics, Konstantin 
Morozov called on everyone to "get used to the fact that there 
is no longer a territory of the former USSR and there is no 
young, sovereign, or some other Ukraine, but simply the 
independent state Ukraine." 
  Konstantin Morozov said that he supports Ukraine's signing 
the Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 Treaty because this would 
allow it, along with Russia, to be a full participant in the 
world process of nuclear disarmament and to be a country 
responsible for destroying its share of nuclear weapons. The 
only mistake of the Ukrainian leadership, in the words of the 
general, is the fact that it did not define the new status of 
Ukraine, with which it must join the Nuclear Weapons 
Nonproliferation Treaty. In his opinion, Ukraine must join with 
a special declaration of its support of the idea of the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the planet and the 
control of their transfer to third countries, and it must define 
its status as a "temporary nuclear state that is reducing its 
share of nuclear weapons from the former USSR." 
  In this connection, Konstantin Morozov spoke out in favor of 
the establishment of an international commission to monitor the 
dismantling of the nuclear weapons removed from Ukraine, because 
"Ukraine really does not have full assurance that the missiles 
will be destroyed rather than redistributed." 
  The former minister of defense also made a number of other 
comments differing from the point of view of official Kiev. In 
particular, he criticized the trilateral Moscow declaration, 
calling it a "naked declaration that does not even guarantee the 
political interests of Ukraine." In the opinion of Morozov, it 
is necessary to sign a trilateral agreement that would be 
subject to ratification in the parliaments of the three 
countries and that would provide for international control of 
its fulfillment by them. It should be noted that this is perhaps 
the most widespread point of view in Ukraine, which finds a 
large number of supporters in different political and military 
circles. 
  Touching on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Konstantin 
Morozov stated that he supports any solution of the problem of 
the Black Sea Fleet, whether it be a gift, a transfer to Russia, 
or division and destruction, but under one mandatory condition 
-- the removal of the Fleet and its infrastructure from 
Ukrainian territory. In his opinion, the most advantageous 
solution for Ukraine is the 1992 Yalta agreement on the division 
of the Black Sea Fleet into Ukrainian and Russian parts and the 
establishment of naval forces of Ukraine and Russia on this 
basis. At the same time, Konstantin Morozov declared that the 
military forces of Ukraine are adequate to resolve the problem 
of the Black Sea Fleet in favor of Ukraine, but "these forces 
must not be the basic argument; rather it is necessary to seek 
political solutions for every question." Konstantin Morozov also 
said that he supported a political solution with respect to the 
Crimean problem, which he called artificial and produced by the 
political passivity of official Kiev. In the opinion of Morozov, 
Kiev must pass laws that would first stabilize the situation in 
the Crimea and then would make Crimean legislation correspond to 
that of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armed Forces of Ukraine Armaments Staff </F>
Directorate for Industrial Orders and Liaison Chief 
Major-General Viktor Petrovych Vashchylin by NARODNA ARMIYA 
correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel Oleh Vachayev under the rubric 
"The Defense Industry Must Work for Defense": "`Everything Must 
Be Done To See That Scientific and Production Potential is 
Preserved'"] 
  [Text] Background information: Born in 
Altay to the family of a peasant. Completed the Omsk Tank 
Technical School and the Armor Academy with distinction, and 
then the faculty of the command and engineering personnel of the 
same academy with a gold medal. He has served both in the field 
and in production--in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, in 
the Far East and Carpathian military districts, and in various 
command and engineering posts. He has been chief of the 
Directorate for Industrial Orders and Liaison of the armaments 
staff of the armed forces of Ukraine since November of 1993. 
  He is married, with a son who is a senior lieutenant 
following in his father's footsteps, serving at a repair 
enterprise. 
  [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, a map of Ukraine takes up a 
good 
half of the wall in your office, with the enterprises that make 
up the defense industry marked on it. I have heard that the 
production potential of the VPK [military-industrial complex] 
here is quite strong, but it turns out that I did not imagine 
the true scope of it. Quite a `domain' for just your 
directorate... 
  [Vashchylin] It is indeed still a novelty that a unified 
directorate for orders of weaponry and military hardware has 
been created here. Another two structures actually exist that 
perform some of these tasks, but the principal burden falls on 
us. 
  I would say for comparison that there were 39 directorates 
that placed orders in the former Union, with personnel numbering 
some 3,900. They did not make it to a unified structure then, 
even though they tried... 
  I would thus like to emphasize that we are not only new 
people in the system of procurement of weapons and hardware that 
are series-produced, but that we do not even have the 
opportunity of making use of experience in that work. True, such 
a system exists in the highly developed countries--the United 
States and France, among others--but there the unified body is 
subordinate to a specially assigned deputy secretary or minister 
of defense. This emphasizes the importance of the development 
and ordering of weaponry and military hardware, which should be 
under unified supervision. 
  If we take the life cycle of an item as a whole, then there 
are the stages of development, the production itself and 
operation... Those stages were concentrated in the same hands, 
but in different directorates, in the former Union. So the items 
were created, so to speak, nearby. Though the departmental 
barriers were not always helpful... 
  I thus feel that the unification of orders for industry in a 
directorate is the most expedient. Moreover, under conditions 
where military acceptance offices monitor the development and 
production at the design bureaus and we have information 
pertaining to operation through complaint work and trips to the 
field, we come to encompass the whole cycle in general. 
  [Vachayev] I know that discussions have been underway for a 
long time with regard to where the orders to industry should 
originate. If this work is concentrated in the directorate, does 
that signify that the question has been removed from the agenda? 
  [Vashchylin] This is quite a difficult problem. The 
viewpoint 
used to exist that money for procurements had to be given only 
to us and no one else. But life has shown that the supply 
directorate should have some procurement functions. There has to 
be a lead or general customer who fills orders for the armed 
forces as a whole, with regard to scientific developments, a 
large range of items and so on. Certain spare parts and 
materials should be partially procured by the supply structures 
as well. 
  Why? Because the regiment needs funds, and little gets to 
the 
units under centralized procedure, as life has shown. They are, 
moreover, linked with local industry; it is easier for them to 
acquire everything they need. The regiments, divisions and 
districts must be given that money, but supply services, which 
are above them, are able to obtain funds for procurements. But 
the chiefs of the directorates to which the units are 
subordinate have to designate and ascertain the range of what is 
needed by the troops. Experience shows that all of these tasks 
are accomplished faster through local capabilities and knowledge 
of their own requirements. 
  Territorial supply bodies exist as well. The directorates 
themselves, concluding the corresponding agreements, should 
obtain what goes through them. Otherwise, there would be an 
unjustified rolling of mat&eacute;riel and money across all of 
Ukraine. 
  And, on the contrary, what comes from the plants, from heavy 
industry, has to be received by a unified body. The security 
measures, transport, distribution and other issues are adhered 
to in that case. 
  If we are to speak of the long term, then there should be 
bodies, albeit small, within the concerned directorates that 
place orders in the local areas. This is because there are 
issues that need to be resolved in the interests of one's own 
branch of the service or subordinate units. But all of this can 
happen provided that we become, so to speak, richer. 
  [Vachayev] The question arises of interaction between you 
and 
other bodies. Is there understanding? 
  [Vashchylin] Work has become considerably easier since those 
directorates delegated to us some functions pertaining first and 
foremost to large orders, the major items. Moreover, the chiefs 
of departments and groups in our directorate visit the chiefs of 
other directorates every week, where they have an exchange of 
information and seek out opportunities for the common resolution 
of their problems. We are actively involving the directorate in 
checking the field offices at enterprises on the pursuit of 
cadre policy. We already have a Statute on Interaction that has 
been approved by the deputy minister of defense for armaments 
and chief of armaments for the armed forces of Ukraine and 
coordinated with the chief of every directorate and legal 
scholars. It clearly defines where our work and where the work 
of the directorates begins. 
  This work procedure will also ease the signing and 
coordination of all the necessary documents at various levels. 
Imagine if every directorate chief would have to run around from 
office to ministry with his questions, wasting time in vain and 
repeating the same work. And there will be no order then at 
all... 
  [Vachayev] The next question, no less important, is what the 
directorate is engaged in. I have in mind the field or 
acceptance offices. I know that when the problem of the 
co-existence of your structure and the supply directorates was 
being debated, the latter wanted them to be left with them... 
  [Vashchylin] The number of personnel at the acceptance 
offices was reduced by 37 percent through combinations and the 
existence of a unified directorate for placing orders. There 
used to be four or five offices operating at each plant, with 
each branch of the service performing their own acceptance. Now 
that is gone. But unified acceptance at the enterprises, after 
all, works in the interests of the tankers, the engineers and 
the truckers. 
  We have a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on 
the procedure for the organization and interaction of field 
offices and industry and a document on acceptance that has been 
coordinated with all of the directorates, in which we have 
assumed all of the contemporary requirements for that body, 
questions pertaining to monitoring and product quality. 
  A uniform approach has been devised for the organization of 
complaint and claim work as well, but it still requires 
refinement from a legal standpoint. 
  [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, whatever issues I may raise 
with 
you, it all comes down to questions of financing and money. I 
know that these problems exist with you as well, as with all of 
the defense industry as a whole. I would like to clarify a thing 
or two in that area as well. 
  I'll start with our own sore spots. It happened that we in 
the directorates that place the orders do not have a single one 
of our own business accounts. All of the transactions are 
performed through the Financial Directorate of the MO [Ministry 
of Defense]; that is, it takes all of the responsibility upon 
itself. And that deprives us of the right to lodge any 
complaints against suppliers. We do not have the opportunity of 
having any direct influence on the matter in which we are 
engaged from the economic and legal standpoints. What a paradox! 
  Another problem consists of the fact that the absence of our 
own business account leads to our financing according to the 
whatever's-left-over principle. The money that is allocated only 
to the Financial Directorate (and we are not able to have any 
influence on the Ministry of Finance) goes to maintain the armed 
forces, and some of the leftovers to the things we do. 
  True, it is not just a matter of the lack of a business 
account here, but rather the need for a budget as such. The 
experience of many countries, however, shows that the funds that 
are required just for the development and procurement of 
armaments and hardware are from three to seven percent of the 
gross national product. Here, the minimum value of that 
indicator goes to maintain the armed forces as a whole. However, 
if you take my own question of procurements, then last year we 
procured 12 percent of the new weaponry and hardware, and the 
rest went for spare parts. Talking about the budget, meanwhile, 
we received half of the minimum we were planning on. 
  The situation this year is even worse. They did not want to 
leave even a line on financing a series of matters, including 
procurements, when they were formulating the budget; even though 
we are planning to obtain a little more than 20 percent of the 
new models of weaponry and hardware... 
  It is not just a matter of the fact that the armed forces 
require new hardware and weaponry. There are more than 700 
enterprises in the defense industry standing behind these 
figures that do not have enough work. And that, as they say, is 
threatening unforeseen consequences. 
  If the question of creating a national program of 
shipbuilding and financing for it is not resolved in the next 
couple of years, for example, the slipways will be engaged in 
just so-called dollar projects, and we will not be able to place 
a single order there. Whereas they used to feel in the defense 
industry 
that getting work from the MO was a guarantee of stability, the 
opposite idea prevails today: Have as little as possible to do 
with defense orders as quickly as possible, because there are no 
guarantees of payments. And that could lead to the disappearance 
of the defense industry, as such. 
  [Vachayev] Stock offerings and privatization, which could 
affect the former enterprises of the defense industry, are 
beginning nonetheless... 
  [Vashchylin] I am convinced that the basic enterprises of 
the 
defense sector must be subordinate to the state, and perhaps to 
the Ministry of Defense. We could perhaps go the way of 
acquiring 51 percent of the shares of stock in those 
enterprises. Turning to the experience of the developed 
countries, it must be pointed out that a state sector remains in 
the defense industry in them. And we should spare no funds in 
this, since no owner will accept an order if it does not satisfy 
him ahead of time on a financial plane. 
  The very acute question of organization within the framework 
of a reasonable cycle of production of weaponry and hardware of 
our own also arises here. It is considered expedient when that 
cycle is 40-60 percent self-contained; that is, it is virtually 
nowhere self-contained within the framework of a single state. 
When resolving this issue we should decide, figuratively 
speaking, who we are. Keeping in mind that we have 100 percent 
weaponry and hardware from the former Union, and almost a 
quarter of the entire defense output was made by Ukraine, it is 
not hard to find the answer. I am convinced that full-fledged 
and mutually advantageous ties with Russia will provide work for 
our enterprises, will provide the necessary funds and will 
facilitate the maintenance of combat readiness in the armed 
forces of Ukraine at a suitable level. 
  There is another reserve that we are able to utilize -- the 
arms trade on the world market. Recall that the USSR received 29 
billion dollars a year from sales. There is no more Union, but a 
vacuum has not been created in the arms market, since the 
developed countries have instantly taken its place. They felt 
this in Russia, and they began thinking about their own weapons 
program and access to trade somewhere around a year and a half 
ago. The corresponding structure, along the lines of a defense 
export organization, has appeared. So why are we marching in 
place? We have a thing or two to sell, believe me. 
  There is another problem that exists that I would put in 
first place -- the preservation of scientific potential. The 
lack of funds and orders is leading to the fact that the smart 
ones are leaving for commercial structures. The scientists and 
designers, in my opinion, must be paid -- and paid good money -- 
even when there is no work. If work should appear, and I am sure 
it will, and there is no one to do it, enormous amounts of money 
will not help. 
  In summing up our discussion, I would like to say that I see 
a threefold task, on which both our directorate and the defense 
industry as a whole are working, namely to preserve scientific 
potential, industry and the output of defense products, both in 
peacetime and during special periods. 
  [Vachayev] Thank you for the interesting conversation.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel </F>
Serhiy Chornous: "`We Need To Preserve What Has Been Done and 
Move On to New Solutions--Said President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk in a Discussion With a NARODNA ARMIYA Correspondent 
During a Visit to the Exhibition of the Achievements of the 
Scientists of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"] 
  [Text] A shirt from basalt, a most common mineral. 
But not that simple. A shirt such that neither a bullet nor a 
criminal's knife can penetrate it. And the gloves! They look 
most ordinary, like wool, like thousands of others. But not at 
all! One wearing them can confidently grab the blade of a knife 
and boldly snatch it away out of the hands of a criminal--it 
will not cut you. That is also the strange power of the scarf 
that protects the neck of the wearer against injury from knives 
and from the sharpest razor. And what use is an antenna that 
deploys like an umbrella! This is, however, a special antenna, 
for special communications... We should not talk about that 
aloud. 
  All of these and many other wondrous things could be 
seen at the exhibition of the "Scientific and Technical 
Achievements of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in the 
Interests of Defense and Security," which was a substantial 
portion of the general exhibition devoted to the 75th 
anniversary of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Seventy-five 
scientific organizations were represented by 1,300 exhibits. 
  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of 
Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Radetskyy and representatives of interested agencies and 
institutions visited the exhibition, as NARODNA ARMIYA has 
reported. Here is a little more detail on some of the exhibits 
that made up the show. 
  There are some 130 SS-19 liquid-fueled heavy missiles in 
Ukraine today. There are more than three thousand tonnes of 
highly toxic fuel in their tanks. One one-thousandth of a 
milligram in a liter of water is a deadly poison. The latest 
missiles -- the solid-fueled SS-24 -- are a real problem. They 
cannot simply be lifted out of their silos. They must be kept at 
a temperature of 5.35 degrees Celsius, after all. No such 
salvaging technology exists around the world. A question faces 
Ukraine: What to do with the missile fuel, sell it? There is no 
one to sell it to. Blow it up? Not safe. Burn it up? Too 
expensive, very much so. The missiles turned out to be made 
without a thought toward the technology for destroying them. 
There is no such technology. 
  No, there is such a technology! That is what the scientists 
of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and enthusiasts from the 
Yuzhnoye KB [Design Bureau] have said. They have developed a 
unique technology for the conversion of the highly toxic missile 
fuel into a safe powder that can be stored for years, without 
harming either the health of people or nature. This substance 
could even be converted quickly and easily, if necessary, back 
into the fearsome missile fuel heptyl. 
  Ukrainian scientists are also engaged in solving problems of 
salvaging the SS-24 missiles. They have successfully resolved 
this difficult engineering task as well. This technology, as 
with everything that is ingenious, is simple. A reagent is 
poured into a solid-fuel engine of the missile, and two 
substances are obtained not long afterward. They are not 
explosive, not harmful and are even useful for everything 
living. These substances can be used as fertilizer in 
agriculture. Judge for yourself -- roses placed in a solution of 
this substance last for months. 
  The Institute of Electric Welding imeni Yevhen Paton had a 
large exhibition. One's attention is directed toward a welded 
metal object. Its volume is just 2.5 liters. It is easily 
accommodated in an ordinary briefcase. But if necessary, it 
unfolds like an accordion into a rigid, airtight structure with 
a volume of 150 liters. This wondrous metal tank can withstand 
space loads as well. The unique technologies of this scientific 
collective have made it possible to manufacture welding guns in 
the briefest instant. This invention is widely utilized in 
shipbuilding and other sectors of machine building. Specialists 
were also surprised by a material with... memory. A metallic 
item that is like a piece of paper, crumpled up and placed on a 
table. But amazingly, it unfolds before our eyes and becomes as 
it was before. This invention has also been brought into being. 
  The range of scientific achievements of the Institute of 
Electric Welding is quite broad. It is worth noting that 
enthusiasts have developed a technology for elemental welding 
that is already being employed successfully in electronics. 
Romantics of science from the leading institute have also 
astonished the world with the fact that they have made the 
impossible a reality. They can weld steel, copper and aluminum 
elements. These metals still cannot be joined to each other 
around the world. But the Kiev specialists are welding them... 
by explosion. The people from Paton have safely harnessed the 
explosion for the economy, and have forced it to work for the 
good of man. They have developed a technology for cutting by 
explosion. Much of this was already known. The blades of a 
helicopter in trouble are "blown off" with an explosion so that 
the crew can eject from the craft. The hatch on the Nakhimov 
motor vessel that sank was also blown off with the aid of an 
explosion. The canopies of military aircraft are also jettisoned 
by a directed explosion in ejections. This technology was 
developed for saving the crew on the famous Buran as well. 
  They are able to weld titanium and ceramic objects at the 
Institute imeni Paton. This scientific establishment is 
undoubtedly a leader in the welding of armor. 
  The scientists at the exhibition demonstrated a technology 
for the remelting of gun barrels. The metal retains its quality 
therein, which is not identical in various parts of the barrel. 
This makes it possible to economize a considerable amount of 
funds. And nearby is an unusual exhibit. It is an aerial bomb. 
Its "jacket," or casing, has certain qualities. It splits into 
fragments upon explosion, and as the designer envisaged, even 
the empennage of the bomb is transformed into a deadly fragment 
of a certain weight and shape. 
  The scientists have also developed an electron-beam device 
that makes it possible to weld fuel tanks for the heaviest 
missiles in the world, and the weld seams are even stronger than 
the material therein. 
  Engine parts rebuilt with electron-beam welding serve longer 
than new ones. Instruments and devices for welding in space, 
under water and in the field could be seen here. The latter is 
without gas or electricity. And the use of pincers that increase 
human strength by 20 times help to join parts firmly. 
  Technologies were also shown that have no analogues around 
the world. Specialists from the West thus displayed considerable 
interest in those inventions. Specialists from the U.S. Customs 
Service expressed the intention of procuring the individual 
protective gear that was mentioned above. Armored vests with 
traditional composite materials, ceramics and titanium, for 
example, cannot "hold" a bullet. This often leads to shock for 
the person being protected. Worse things can happen as well; the 
force of the bullet ruptures the internal organs of the person. 
That does not happen with the armored vests made from the fabric 
manufactured with basalt. 
  A most unusual box, and far from a simple one, was also 
presented for viewing at the exhibition. This is a "perpetual" 
box. It does not burn or decay. This invention is for the 
military, since some ammunition is being stored in Ukraine today 
on open sites, and the boxes with their deadly contents are 
rotting. Tare made from basalt is light, and cheaper as well, 
than the wood that is used today in the military. 
  The Scientific-Research Institute of Problems of Materials 
Science imeni I.M. Frantsevych demonstrated engine parts made 
from `tikat'. This new material does not melt at temperatures of 
1,350 degrees. Specialists from the institute, along with 
scientists from the United States and Germany, are building a 
new engine from the new material. It will be an engine for the 
twenty-first century. There is already an agreement. The Plant 
imeni Malyshev Production Association in Kharkiv has moreover 
already manufactured an internal-combustion engine in which all 
of the most important parts are made from this material. 
  The inventiveness of the Institute of the Physics of Metals 
of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine has reached heights that 
have not yet been conquered by their colleagues from the highly 
developed countries of the world. The exhibits speak eloquently 
for the specialists of the institute. Here are two pieces of 
armor -- one is 45 mm thick, of the steel that is used today for 
the manufacture of tanks, armored personnel carriers and 
infantry fighting vehicles. Next to it is armor 16 mm thick from 
superhard steel. It is no less strong than the conventional 
armor that is thicker and almost three times heavier. This is 
armor from ceramics, combination armor, from polymers and the 
technology developed to weld them. 
  The Institute of Superhard Materials demonstrates plates of 
altinite -- a ceramic anti-shaped charge tank armor. The 
scientists of this institute are working on the Tank-90 program. 
  The Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Academy of 
Sciences 
of Ukraine also showed its inexhaustible capabilities. Its 
staffers, like sorcerers, are able to develop and manufacture 
paints with assigned characteristics for any taste and color -- 
anti-radiation, anti-corrosion... As well as those that conceal 
hardware from the all-seeing eye of radar. 
  Specialists from the Institute of Problems of Mathematical 
Machinery presented a significant exhibit. Reviewers directed 
attention to their interesting and profound developments in the 
automation of operational control for staffs, as well as 
neurocomputers that work on the operating principles of the 
human nervous system. 
  The exposition of the Institute of Sociology of the Academy 
of Sciences of Ukraine was interesting in the depth of its 
research. The state of the armed forces and the sentiments and 
hopes of its personnel were reflected in figures and graphs as 
in a magic mirror. 
  The variety, importance and scientific value of the 
exhibits presented at the Science Expo Center have not removed 
from the agenda the question of bringing to life the great 
achievements and accomplishments of the scientists of Ukraine. 
What ways should be taken? What priorities should be defined? 
How can the mighty scientific potential of the state be 
preserved, and the production capacity of the 
military-industrial complex of Ukraine be utilized, so that 
science and the defense industry are working for the good of the 
Ukrainian people? 
  The NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent addressed these 
questions to Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine and President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. 
  They must be modern and efficient and inexpensive," 
answered Leonid Makarovych. "I say inexpensive, allowing for our 
capabilities today. That which we can do today must be done -- 
current research and that which has already been done must not 
be lost. And, naturally, we must proceed to new solutions. 
  "We are destroying the nuclear weapons, the matter is 
clear there. We are not able to manage, utilize or provide 
properly for those weapons. But the security of the state must 
be guaranteed. We must therefore seek out new ways and develop 
other types of protection that support the defense of the 
country. 
  "There was a great deal that was interesting at the 
exhibition. I think that today we will be supporting the highest 
priority projects, with a regard for the fact that they will 
work to the maximum effect for defense and security tomorrow. 
That is the most efficient way."

"Meeting With Vietnamese Military Delegation"] 
  [Text] A military delegation from the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam [SRV] arrived in Kiev on 9 March of this year on an 
official visit. The delegation was headed by Colonel-General Dao 
Dinh Luyen, chief of the General Staff of the People's Army of 
the SRV. 
  In a meeting with Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of 
the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and First 
Deputy Minister of Defense, the two sides discussed the 
prospects of military cooperation, particularly in the 
military-technical field, as well as the training of officer 
personnel. 
  The two sides exchanged information about the progress being 
made in building up the national armed forces of their two 
states and noted the need for a regular exchange of experience 
gained in solving the problems they encounter. 
  The members of both delegations were unanimous in their 
opinion that there are good prospects of a mutually advantageous 
and equal cooperation between the ministries of defense of 
Ukraine and the SRV. 
  Yesterday, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's 
defense minister, received the Chief of the General Staff of the 
People's Army of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Article by Valdis Kiploks: "The Quiet, Merciless War: </F>
Sending Unarmed Soldiers into Combat is a Crime!"] 
  [Text] Valdis Kiploks continues his discussion of the 
disorder and even degradation in Latvia's defense organizations. 
At the center of attention: the Home Guard. But not it alone... 
  One must agree with Defense Forces Commander D. 
Turlais's statement that right now the threats to the 
independence and security of the Latvian state are greater than 
the ability to thwart them (interview in the newspaper LABRIT, 
26 January of this year, "A Running Officer Provokes Laughter in 
Peacetime".) Previously (RIGAS BALSS, 4 January) I wrote "The 
Quiet, Merciless War" about the growth in Russia's legal 
activities related to the withdrawal of military forces from our 
country. We must return to these themes yet again, first of all 
because the government has finally seemingly recognized the 
priority of national defense and also the Saeima has approved 
supplementary sums for these needs. But this money will provide 
only evil if serious endeavors are not undertaken to clean up 
defense organizations. 
  The complicated state defense system can be simplified in 
the 
classical way by thinking of it as a tiered fortress defense, in 
which the first line of defense is manned by diplomats, the 
second by ideology, the third by national industry; the fourth, 
though, is the fortress itself, that is the national military 
defense forces. If the first three lines of defense spend their 
time in uninterrupted struggles which the founder of military 
theory, Clausewitz, reminds us that peacetime is only imaginary, 
then defense forces in this time carry out only the role of 
catalyst. In an active battle they would be drawn in and their 
direct functions will be carried out only in time of military 
conflict, therefore in the event of final necessity, when the 
first three lines of defense have not achieved what is desired. 
Of course, the meaning and arrangement of these lines of defense 
varies from country to country. For example, in the 
over-militarized Russia, all defense is based almost entirely on 
the military complex and that dominates the diplomatic, 
psychological, industrial and other spheres. In such a country 
the diplomat Kozyrev or the politician Zhirinovskiy can afford 
to explore openly armed provocations; their national defense 
will not suffer from it, for that is guaranteed by a giant army, 
armed with weapons of mass destruction, and the consequences of 
their use scientists can only predict, but not precisely 
calculate. There are similar defense systems in all of the 
militarized great powers except Japan and Germany. The latter 
was not permitted by the victorious countries to develop a new 
Wehrmacht after its capitualation in 1945 and it now is 
seriously reviewing its defense doctrine. Similar defense issues 
are being resolved also in the war-vanquished Japan. 
  Such a model of defense, which was forced on Japan and 
Germany, but on smaller countries because of meager resources, 
cannot protect and they came to establish a total defense 
system, in which all lines of defense flowed together in a 
seemingly amorphous formation, though actually each 
insignificant basic organization is subordinated in coordinated 
action from one center. The exceptions are the defense forces, 
which stand as a discrete organization carrying out training, 
supply, and the aforementioned coordination functions. That is a 
description of an ideal type, in which there would not be also 
military defense forces, but all the country's defense problems 
would be resolved by "public defense," which was offered as an 
alternative to the military by Albert Einstein Institute senior 
researcher J. Sharp in his speech at the symposium, "New 
Thinking About European Security." (It is known in Latvia in an 
expanded version as the brochure, "Defense of Independent 
Countries Without War and Destruction.") But Mr. Sharp should 
have known that science and philosophy would permit such an 
ideal--absolute harmony--only as a momentary pause, after which 
the rapid slide downward begins, so that the concrete process 
begins anew, a difficult ascent, but of a different quality. And 
that is a sufficient basis to conclude that "public defense" 
alone can never be an alternative to a military. If we truly 
want to defend ourselves, then we can only go down this road of 
plenty and there is no alternative. 
  It becomes clear from the D. Turlais interview that Latvia 
still does not have a national defense doctrine, since the 
Defense Ministry must analyze potential threats to our country. 
But what should be the relationship between this analysis and 
the working out of the basic law on national defense? National 
defense cannot be implemented for just some individual event, 
but must be effective against any, often sudden and unforeseen 
type of attack. This defense force "umbrella law" must 
determine, according to a defense system developed according to 
some model, how we will arrive at the end result and how that 
will be integrated, first of all, with the Baltic states' mutual 
defense system. Two years have passed since the renewal of the 
country's independence. Yet, we still have no laws nor 
doctrines. But there have been no changes made in the 
composition of Defense Ministry personnel. And, if that has not 
yet been done, then there is a basis for thinking that in the 
Defense Ministry they are not exerting themselves by sitting on 
eggs that will never hatch, and that the empty nest-egg should 
be taken out. 
  But, if we are talking about threats to our national 
security, then it would be interesting to know the conclusions 
of such a competent analysis regarding which is more dangerous: 
the activities of Zhirinovsky's without political anesthesia, 
self-declared, Russian "Derzhavniki" [Statists], or 
the masked "Western expansion," and what might be the defense 
against each of these events? Everybody knows the facts about 
the transfer of many millions of dollars, which the Central 
Committee of the CPSU donated to the Communist parties they 
maintained in various countries, not to fund picnics, but to 
maintain the dirty deals and destructive actions connected with 
associated companies in these countries. But now, right in front 
of our eyes, innumerable foreign companies with dubious 
reputations are establishing here practically uncontrollable 
foreign joint ventures, including Russian and local 
self-seekers. And all of the negative by-products of this 
process show that the characteristics of those activities are 
the same as those for which some USSR Communist party paid such 
collosal sums in the West. Just on 10 January of this year the 
conflict in Riga's Vidzeme borough plainly showed that making 
contact with with such puzzling organizations will be much more 
dangerous than the Skrunda radar remaining and that a whorehouse 
established by some foreign country's military personnel (their 
existence at their respective addresses is news to the municipal 
authorities) could give rise to a military conflict fateful to 
the country. These facts alone already create the belief that 
our government's publicized "Western investment" in Latvia is 
nothing more than the same Communist money flooding in through 
the West. And the apparent sharp disagreement provoked by the 
East serves only to deflect attention from this, our country's 
truly dangerous process. Although in Russia it has been even 
officially announced that for political purposes gigantic sums 
will flood into Latvia. 
  It is clear that the delay in working out the basic law on 
national defense connects the Defense Forces commander and his 
actions in the work of the existing headquarters and creates 
chaos in subordination of defense forces, thereby directing them 
down the path of degradation. National defense cannot be 
developed today by fitting it to some personality or situational 
flow, but we must proceed in accordance with the law, in 
developing a concrete defense system. And we will immediately 
see where such unnecessary delay takes us. 
  Today it is clear to every somewhat thinking person that 
Latvia's defense cannot be ensured by barbed wire fences and 
minefields on the country's borders, nor could it be done with a 
Maginot or Mannerheim line. Only the aforementioned seemingly 
amorphous national total defense formation can create the threat 
of unacceptable casualties to an invader and cool the heads of 
warriors. If we accept that right now the worries about our 
security are directly related to Russia's behavior, then 
Russia's critical demographic characteristic right now still 
shows that the former popular and military mass is not there any 
more and so this factor cannot be depended on. 
  The most appropriate defense to develop in a modern state 
was 
the Home Guard. Correctly organized, well trained, armed and 
supplied, it could have become the basis for such a defense. But 
at that time, contrary to the accepted standards of defense 
development, it was not subordinated to the Defense Ministry and 
the supreme command of the Defense Forces. And what is happening 
there now? 
  In the training for the officers of the Riga Home Guard 
brigade in October, company commanders spent a whole week 
learning how to determine proper protocol for a completely woozy 
person, that it is humane to hit someone sleeping on the street 
in the nose, to make it bleed, because without bleeding and some 
apparent trauma medics simply will not take this person and he 
will freeze, and that car theft does not qualify as theft, 
because such a crime is missing an "objective side." They 
clarified still others of the Russian criminal code demagogic 
absurdities actually in force and the militia's acquired tricks. 
And such training is paid for, so, as was said on television, 
more will be carried out! 
  Theorists of revolutionary wars and practice prove that 
organizations established according to voluntary principles, 
such as our Home Guard, can have only one task: to protect the 
people and the country. Losing that, it disintegrates with the 
tendency of individual groupings to develop new or to integrate 
themselves with already existing criminal character 
organizations. Thus the world-renowned Italian mafia, "la Cosa 
Nostra," developed from the self-defense organizations of 
Sicily's inhabitants. Totalitarian regimes did not permit the 
existence of organized crime without state sanction (the coming 
into existence of those is one of the surest weaknesses of the 
regime and symptoms of imminent collapse), therefore after 
carrying out their assignment these organizations are simply 
liquidated. Thus totalitarian regimes liquidated the 
Oprichniki, the early Chekha, the 
Istrebiteli, Rem's Shturmoviki in Red 
Russia, and the Red Guards--the implementors of the "Cultural 
Revolution" in China. 
  This same destruction theory and practice is safely and 
effectively used by psychological warfare specialists and 
parallel to the chief task in these organizations or popular 
movements with patriotic motivation brings in some side 
assignment or responsibility. With that division, the 
organization is innoculated with the virus and its movement in 
the main direction is practically halted. A glaring example of 
this sort of invasion is found in the actions of the Supreme 
Council, etc. 
  The people who joined the Home Guard were patriots, and in 
the beginning it was organized to protect Latvia's independence. 
But now at such a critical time to the country, it is obviously 
being shifted to carrying out police auxilliary service 
functions! Thus, it is on the road to degradation and 
disintegration! 
  One of the characteristics of revolutionary war tactics, to 
influence the enemy in the most painful way possible, is the 
fourth thesis formulated by Mao Zedong: "Concentrate in every 
battle on superior enemy forces." This thesis must be understood 
to mean that by pretending to rob banks, telegraph centrals and 
other objects one achieves their stationary guard. And, the more 
objects that are guarded, and the larger numerically are the 
guard units, the more beneficial the situation will be for the 
attackers. A well-planned operation in such an instance will 
involve a numerically small, well-prepared group of men, who can 
destroy many numerically large guard units in a few hours. 
Working out countermeasures to such tactics the German military 
specialist E. Vorwerk wrote: "One must have the perimeters of 
objects guarded by those who have a stake in saving the country. 
For the most part the existing protected objects and sensitive 
points must be locked together in object groups, which are close 
together, and they must be protected by roving patrols, but at 
irregular times." 
  And what is our Home Guard occupied with right now? Chiefly 
with the stationary protection of companies able to pay to 
protect themselves! It is hard to believe that that is out of 
ignorance or circumstance; it is more logical to conclude that 
the Home Guard is deliberately being prepared in conformance 
with the aforementioned scheme or even without pretend robberies 
and noises, with the help of the same aforementioned Communist 
party money. 
  An increase in funding from the state budget for the Home 
Guard in such a situation will only promote it as the collapse 
of the national defense organizations. And that is why it is 
without resistance subordinated to the Defense Ministry and the 
Defense Forces command, no matter how powerless and undeveloped 
this ministry is right now. The experience of Lithuania and 
Estonia is that with such a merging of defense forces protests 
from some Home Guard commanders or even units could be 
anticipated. But that will only prove that it is not in their 
own personal interest to subordinate themselves to anyone and it 
will clearly show how productive were the activities of the 
rotting invaders of the the Home Guard. 
  Both the Defense Forces and the Home Guard still are short 
of 
weapons. We are talking here about the most basic soldier's 
armaments: mortars, grenades, machine guns, automatic rifles, 
flame throwers, etc. That must be labeled as particularly 
illogical because producing these weapons is simple in reality. 
The experience of war indicates that producing them without 
particular difficulty can be begun in a week's time wherever 
there are general-purpose metalworking tables. Latvia has enough 
specialists and all the prerequisites for light weapon 
production. In its place they open a monopoly company store, 
where Home Guardsmen must use their personal resources to 
acquire pistols and carbines, but not the automatic weapons 
needed for defending the country. In addition, even these 
limited arms end up in the hands of civilians who have money and 
a personal interest. No one in the government has shown any 
interest in weapons so essential to national defense, such as 
mortars, grenades and automatic rifles, and none of the Riga 
Home Guard batallions have any of that. One must must be 
severely limited to be unable to understand what kind of 
policies and from what quarters it comes! 
  Production and sale of battlefield weapons is one of the 
most 
profitable businesses in any country and in the current 
situation it cannot be allowed to be managed by a private 
company. Such action will permit store proprietors to skim off 
public money intended for national defense needs into their own 
pockets, and state control over this branch would be lost. 
  The battle readiness of the army, including the Home Guard, 
is determined by three factors. "If one of them is zero or only 
at a low level, then the level of battle readiness, irrespective 
of the strength of the other indicators, will not exceed the 
level of the lowest factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, 
then the remaining determinants of battle readiness cannot save 
you." For the sake of clarity in his interview Mr. Turlais 
should have expressed this axiom to its end, that is, "A 
government that sends into battle unarmed soldiers, is a 
criminal one." 
  Completely puzzling in the interview are the Defense Forces 
commander's statements about the functions of the Defense 
Ministry, it activities and his relationship with this 
institution. In reality and also in essence, the Defense Forces 
commander also is a member of the government and democracy would 
not tolerate it if the supreme commander would also be the 
Minister and the Defense Ministry did not exist. The division of 
power principle would not change by that. Defense ministries 
were established in the highly organized countries to free 
defense force commanders from all the ancillary duties, such as 
supplies, finance and other similar questions and so they coiuld 
effectively resolve only one assignment: the military defense of 
the country. In addition, by establishing a total model of 
national defense, all civilian spheres are included and the 
defense ministry must resolve problems associated with it. Here, 
too, issues of a military character remain within the competence 
of the supreme commander. One can imagine what kind of defense 
that would be in war time, if military operations were planned 
by a civilian ministry and the commander received those plans 
the evening before the battle. 
  In his ignorance the staggering officer will be no better 
than the running one to whom D. Turlais referred. And, freeing 
ourselves from Soviet thinking, we must still understand how to 
avoid falling into the trench of helplessness. The Defense 
Forces commander is and must be the person who has the final 
word in all military questions, within the national defense 
policy confines determined by the Saeima and Constitution, of 
course. And such a commander will have the recognition and 
support of the people.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Akhundlu: "There Is No Peace on the Border: </F>
Notes from an Expanded Meeting of the Border Troops Directorate 
of the Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security"] 
  [Text] The Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security 
border troops serve their duty in complex operational 
conditions. As was already reported, during combat actions 
Armenian armed formations reached the Azeri-Iranian border and 
now a significant part of Azeri territory is under their 
control. Tens of thousands of refugees from regions occupied by 
the enemy are also concentrated on the border. This diverts 
personnel from their primary duties, and border troops are 
participating in combat operations, distributing humanitarian 
aid coming from the Iranian side, and conducting scheduled 
activities in regions where camps for refugees in the border 
zone are located. 
  Special difficulties in serving on the border arise from the 
incompetence of personnel at the military posts of Dzhalilabad 
and Yardymly, where frequent attempts are made to cross the 
border and bring in contraband. 
  The border in the Geytepe section is not being guarded 
properly. Smuggling and the driving of livestock to the 
neighboring country often occur under the "patronage" of certain 
associates of state and law enforcement organs and soldiers. 
  A difficult situation has taken shape on the northern 
borders 
of our republic. Last year certain leaders of the Dagestan 
society Sadval intended to create tension in this zone and 
resorted to direct provocation. Thus, someone with the nickname 
of Alik from time to time approached the Samur post at 
Yalaminskiy Checkpoint with his detachment and using firearms 
tried to provoke a confrontation and threatened the Azeri border 
troops. As it became clear, this group is closely linked to 
associates of the militsia and GAI [State Automobile Inspection] 
of Magerramkentskiy Rayon, which adjoins our republic. More than 
once militsia associates on Dagestan's territory have beaten up 
drivers of motor vehicles going from Azerbaijan to the Russian 
Federation. 
  One might say the measures which our republic's leadership 
is 
taking to resolve the problems of the local Lezghin population 
are to some extent reducing tension. But the situation on the 
northern border of Azerbaijan also depends to a considerable 
extent on the actions of criminal elements who are sowing 
hostility among our peoples. The rayon public should take a 
stand here and rebuff the provocations. 
  Last year about 3,000 people tried to cross the border with 
Iran. They were citizens of Turkey, Ukraine, Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Iran. More than 13 million rubles and about 1.5 
million manats, 3 million rials, 45,000 U.S. dollars, hundreds 
of head of cattle, sheep, and goats, firearms, cartridges, 
narcotics, and tonnes of aluminum and copper were confiscated 
from offenders. All this was discussed at the expanded meeting 
of the republic Ministry of National Security's Border Troop 
Directorate. 
  As was noted at the meeting, the benefit from the border 
troops could be more appreciable if military discipline were 
more carefully observed at military posts and officers and 
soldiers were more vigilant, honest, and professionally trained. 
The fact that during the year 100 officers and warrant officers 
were discharged from the border troops for various violations is 
also alarming. 
  And 1994 will not be a simple one for the border troops 
either, and a number of proposals to step up the Directorate's 
activity and raise the professional attributes of personnel were 
adopted at the meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Russian Arms Trading Now in </F>
Single Pair of Hands"] 
  [Text] Another transitional period has ended for Russian 
arms sales. The previous special exporters -- Oboronprom (GIU), 
Spetsvneshtekhnika (GKU), and GUSK -- have officially ceased 
operations, and all business has been transferred to the 
Rosvooruzheniye State Company. The state company is no longer a 
part of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations but is 
directly subordinate to the president and the government, 
although the Russian traders are housed in the same offices on 
Ovchinnikovskaya Embankment in Moscow. The state company is also 
staffed with experienced personnel from the former GIU, GKU, and 
GUSK. 
  Rosvooruzheniye was established in accordance with Yeltsin 
edict No. 507 in order to put a stop to unchecked arms exports 
and senseless competition among the special exporters. The idea 
of creating a single state company was supported by Oleg 
Soskovets, Vladimir Shumeyko, and Aleksandr Shokhin. General 
Viktor Samoylov was named general director of the state company; 
he previously served as a Russian government adviser on 
Shumeyko's staff. 
  Arms export licenses will be issued by the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations licensing department, as before, but 
employees of the state company will gather all the consenting 
signatures for each transaction from the relevant departments 
(the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, etc.). Total arms exports from Russia are currently at 
a level of $2 billion annually. Rosvooruzheniye will earn 
commissions of three to seven percent on each sale. It will use 
these funds to develop business (investments in the defense 
complex, participation in international exhibits, etc.). In 
General Samoylov's opinion, Russian arms trading is in good 
hands.

"Success of the FIDAE-94 Is Predetermined by the Participation 
of Russia: So Thinks Axel Cabrera, Chilean Consul in the Russian 
Federation"] 
  [Text] The eighth international aerospace exhibition 
FIDAE-94 will take place in the Chilean capital Santiago from 
the 20th through the 27th of March of this year. A press 
conference of Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin, 
commander-in-chief of the Air Forces and head of the Russian 
delegation, dealt with what our aircraft builders will 
demonstrate at this exhibition. 
  Also participating in the press conference were 
Valentina Tereshkova, the world's first woman astronaut; Yuriy 
Starodub, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Defense 
Industry; Pavel Trishin, deputy general designer of 
"Rosvooruzheniye"; Vice-Admiral Leonid Golovko, arms chief for 
the navy; and Sergey Belousov, general director of the Russian 
exposition. 
  The military-technical cooperation of Russia with the 
countries of the Latin American continent goes back more than 20 
years, but never before have we participated in air shows here. 
FIDAE-94 is the debut for Russian aircraft builders and it is a 
good chance for them to announce their presence loudly in the 
markets of Latin America. Time will tell to what degree they are 
successful in taking advantage of this. Right now we are 
actively preparing for the air show. 
  The fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK and Su-30MK and the 
transport aircraft Il-76 arrived in Chile under their own power, 
having covered more than 16,000 km through the air. The air 
giant An-124 "Ruslan" landed in Santiago two days earlier. It 
had on board light frontal fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB for the 
air show. The main delegation will fly to Latin America on 17 
March on the long-range airliners of the Ilyushin firm Il-62 and 
Il-96-300. 
  They expect 400 firms and companies from 34 countries of the 
world to take part in the FIDAE-94 aerospace exhibition. The 
largest aircraft building firms of Russia, the United States, 
France, England, Germany, Italy, Canada, and many other states 
have set up their displays on specially equipped pavilions and 
exhibition areas covering about 60,000 square meters. The 
directors of all leading aviation companies of Latin America 
have been invited to the air show. Among the honored guests of 
the air show are Col-Gen of Aviation Petr Deynekin, commander in 
chief of the Russian Air Forces; Valentina Tereshkova, first 
woman astronaut; Vladimir Kuzmin, general director of MAPO 
[Moscow Aviation Production Association]; and Mikhail Simonov, 
general designer of the ANPK [Aviation Scientific Production 
Complex] "OKB Sukhoy" [Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau]. 
  The organizers of FIDAE-94 have no doubt about the success 
of 
the air show. Its success is predetermined by the participation 
of Russia in the air show, as Axel Cabrera, Chilean consul in 
Russia, said. According to the forecasts of specialists, the 
aerospace exhibition in Chile will be visited by more than 
600,000 people, including 3,000 marketing agents and merchants 
specializing in the aviation business. 
  "Rosvooruzheniye," a recently established state company for 
the export and import of arms and military equipment, took on 
most of the work in the organization of the Russian section at 
the FIDAE-94 air show. In Chile, Russia intends to demonstrate 
the latest developments and also the series production of more 
than 50 design bureaus, research institutes, and industrial 
enterprises. Altogether, more than 100 different models of 
aviation equipment and arms systems will be presented. The 
participants in the exhibition will be able to familiarize 
themselves with an entire family of Russian delivery sytems, 
antiaircraft missile systems, surface ships and submarines, 
surface skimmers and with various air and naval arms, radar 
complexes, and firearms. But the hit of the air show will still 
be combat aircraft. The commander in chief of the Russian Air 
Forces does not rule out the possibility that some foreign 
pilots will even be given the chance to fly our fighters. 
  MAPO, one of the oldest aviation production associations in 
Russia, is presenting series models of the light frontal 
fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB in Chile. Beginning with the air 
show in Farnboro in 1988, our MIG's have been demonstrated at 
practically all large international aerospace exhibitions, where 
they gained the reputation of being the best light fighters. 
They recently affirmed this reputation in Italy, where they 
carried out instructional air battles between the MIG-29 and the 
American F-15, F-16, and F-18. Our fighters gained a convincing 
"victory" in them. 
  At the air show in Chile, MAPO is proposing to its potential 
partners not only combat aircraft themselves but also guaranteed 
servicing under world standards. 
  And it is hardly likely that anyone at the current air show 
will be able to compete with the fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK 
and Su-30MK of the scientific-production aviation complex "OKB 
Sukhoy." The mere fact that they flew to Chile with just a few 
intermediate landings was a sensation in the aviation world. 
  Chile is not only an air power but a naval power as well. 
Hence, it is understandable why naval themes will also be widely 
represented in the Russian section of the FIDAE-94 show. In 
particular, there are submarines, the "Murena" and "Zubr" 
landing craft on air cushions, which are capable of transporting 
different tracked and wheeled vehicles along with their crews 
(as much as 130 tonnes), the patrol boats "Saygak" and "Muflon," 
a system of tactical strike missile weapons.... 
  The experience of the previous exhibitions and air shows has 
shown that firearms are particularly popular there. Visitors at 
FIDAE-94 will have the chance to get to know the new Kalashnikov 
assault rifles AK-101 and AK-102 (caliber 5.56 mm), the 
underwater pistol SPP-1M (caliber 4.5 mm), a noiseless assault 
rifle, a sniper's rifle, and other weapons. 
  Air shows are costly. Participation in FIDAE-94 will cost us 
at least $600,000, even under the most modest estimates. But it 
is necessary to spend money for this, because there simply is no 
better way to make ourselves known and to present our goods in 
person. By the way, we have already passed the critical point in 
the reduction of Russian military exports. The figures for 1993 
are higher than for 1992. At the present time, Russia's share in 
the total volume of world arms exports is 5 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Temerko, president of the </F>
"Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation, by correspondent 
Valentin Rudenko; date and place not given: "The Future Lies 
With Financial-Industrial Groups"] 
  [Text] The "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation was 
formed on 10 June 1993. It includes concerns and corporations 
which produce basic types of arms and military equipment (the 
"SMM" Joint-Stock Company -- armored equipment and artillery 
systems; the "Aviaprom" Joint-Stock Company -- combat aircraft; 
the "Metallkhim" Joint-Stock Company -- ammunition and 
gunpowder; the "Nord-Vest" Joint-Stock Company -- surface ships 
and submarines; the "Optomprom" Joint-Stock Company -- 
electro-optical instruments; the "Vityaz" Joint-Stock Company -- 
small arms, antitank guided missiles, and portable 
surface-to-air missile systems; the "Antey" Science and 
Production Association -- S-300V, "Tor," and "Buk" 
surface-to-air missile systems; and the "Rosobshchemash" 
Joint-Stock Company -- space systems and missiles), and also the 
"Voyentekh" State Company for the Sale of Arms and Military 
Equipment and others. 
  The Council of Directors is headed by Stanislav Chernov, 
formerly general director of the Kirov Plant and USSR first 
deputy minister of the defense industry, now president of the 
"Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Concern. 
Aleksandr Temerko, formerly head of the Committee for the 
Social Welfare of Military Servicemen, has been elected 
president of the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation. 
  [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, as is well known, the idea 
of financial-industrial groups is not new. They form the basis 
of industrial might in most economically developed countries. A 
number of large industrial enterprises in Russia have now 
decided to set up something similar here. But do the objective 
conditions for this exist? 
  [Temerko] The conditions have existed for some time. 
Moreover, I am convinced that setting up financial-industrial 
groups will become a priority aspect in the structural 
reorganization of Russia's entire economy, as it perhaps offers 
the only possibility at present to preserve our national 
scientific, technical, and industrial potential, including at 
enterprises, design bureaus, and scientific research institutes 
in the defense complex. 
  Whereas previously the military-industrial complex worked 
virtually 100 percent for the state and, naturally, was fully 
financed from the budget, the situation now is drastically 
different. At best, the defense order does not exceed 40-45 
percent of total output, although it is generally 5-15 percent 
with regard to aircraft firms, for example. Moreover, as a 
rule, money is only allocated for this purpose after long delays 
and is eaten up to a considerable extent by galloping inflation. 
Tell me, is it possible in these conditions to supply the Armed 
Forces in full with the weapons systems they need and at the 
same time produce competitive export models of combat equipment? 
Of course not. 
  The absence of budget finance has prompted large defense 
firms to set up financial-industrial groups, which incorporate 
financial structures -- banks, investment and insurance 
companies, management firms, and so forth -- in addition to 
leading design bureaus, series production plants, and 
enterprises supplying components. This process was spontaneous 
at first, but now it has a normative base: The Russian 
Presidential Edict on the Formation of Financial-Industrial 
Groups. The essence of this edict can briefly be summed up as 
follows: It gives the right to attract nonbudgetary resources 
-- both one's own and those of commercial structures 
incorporated in financial-industrial groups -- to solve tasks, 
including tasks relating to the defense complex, and creates the 
conditions for these groups to work in practice. 
  For example, the good idea of forming mobile forces has been 
put forward, but there is no money in the budget to supply them 
with the latest combat equipment. Financial-industrial groups 
could find the money. But only on the condition that money 
spent on the production of defense equipment will be regarded as 
direct investments to meet state needs, will be exempt from tax, 
and will be given the necessary government preference. 
  The Defense Ministry must coordinate all work connected with 
ordering weapons systems, regardless of whether they are paid 
for from the budget or not. 
  Given the obvious inadequacy of the state defense order, 
financial structures' participation in investments will allow 
industrial enterprises to keep their cadres, continue their 
present specialization, and manufacture competitive defense 
equipment for the domestic and foreign markets. For commercial 
banks which are past the formative period and eager for 
large-scale activity, including the possibility of direct 
competition with foreign banks, an alliance with industry also 
signifies a qualitatively new evolutionary step. 
  [Rudenko] Tell me, how do you envisage the mechanism for 
combining financial and industrial capital, and what function 
will the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation assume in this 
process? 
  [Temerko] Our corporation, whose founders and partners 
include leading producers of arms and combat equipment and large 
financial structures, has a highly skilled apparatus, so it sees 
its main task as being able to secure investment in production 
programs within the framework of financial-industrial groups, 
and also to monitor the management of financial resources so 
that a complete cycle of cooperation can be established as far 
as possible. Another important aspect of our activity will be 
to create the right conditions in the market of sale. Moreover, 
in some cases, the special corporation may fulfill the functions 
of a controlling company within financial-industrial groups 
being set up. But in any case the financial-industrial group 
will remain a closed, independent finance and production 
structure. 
  Although financial-industrial groups have been discussed for 
some time, unfortunately none have been legally registered so 
far. There are prototypes, but they are not proper 
financial-industrial groups, so all the work to set them up 
still lies ahead. 
  In our view, financial-industrial groups must not simply be 
a 
focus of powerful scientific and industrial potential; they must 
also actively market their products on the domestic and foreign 
markets. They will have considerably more favorable 
opportunities to present and promote their products in the 
broadest sense at international exhibitions and simply in direct 
competition with foreign firms. That is why 
financial-industrial groups must have the right to engage in 
independent foreign economic activity relating to products they 
create with resources they attract. 
  [Rudenko] But how does this tie in with the state monopoly 
on arms sales and with the current restructuring of 
military-technical cooperation? 
  [Temerko] You mean the reduction in specialist exporters and 
the formation of "Rosvooruzheniye" on the basis of three large 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations foreign trade state 
companies which export and import arms and military equipment 
and, at the same time, duplicate one another? In principle, we 
feel this is the right step to take -- particularly now, when 
our industry and economy are undergoing reform. 
  On the basis of last year's results, military-technical 
cooperation amounts to something in the region of $2.2 billion, 
if you count money received for technical assistance. But there 
are fears that this figure could be substantially lower by the 
end of the year. Heaven forbid that it should fall below the 
critical 1 billion mark. The main task facing "Rosvooruzheniye" 
now is to prevent a possible massive slump, hold on to the main 
markets, and thereby support industry, for which export orders 
have recently acquired very serious significance. 
  Our special corporation is not a direct arms exporter, but 
we 
intend to do our utmost to promote the sale of our country's 
arms and combat equipment abroad and to extend technical 
assistance through investment and by lobbying in favor of 
various decisions both here and abroad. 
  As far as the state monopoly on arms sales is concerned, 
this 
must, of course, continue. But, as Western countries' 
experience shows, it certainly must not only take the form of 
reducing the number of specialist exporters, but must also be 
reflected in strict regulation of military-technical cooperation 
by means of legal conditions and arms export laws. In the 
United States, for example, more than 100 firms are authorized 
to sell military defense products. Approximately the same 
system operates in France, Germany, and a number of other 
countries which have a large share in the sale of arms and 
combat equipment. In turn, involving more structures in the 
export of goods intended for military-technical purposes helps 
to expand markets. Unfortunately, we still do not have a law on 
military-technical cooperation. 
  In short, the system of selling arms must be more flexible, 
particularly now, when defense enterprises are being 
denationalized and turned into joint-stock companies. Not only 
specialist exporters, but also other state structures should 
concentrate on winning new markets. So far, there has been a 
regrouping at the level of "trading" organizations. There were 
three specialist exporters, now there is one. This must be 
followed by structural changes in state bodies of administration. 
  [Rudenko] You mean the creation of a special body of 
administration which could rapidly respond to any change in the 
situation and monitor and coordinate military-technical 
cooperation? 
  [Temerko] Exactly. At present, these functions are, to a 
certain extent, the responsibility of the Commission for 
Military-Technical Cooperation. For all its pluses, this 
commission does not have an adequate apparatus. For objective 
reasons, it cannot embrace the whole range of problems. 
  In the interests of government regulation and monitoring of 
military-technical cooperation in accordance with the Russian 
Federation presidential edict of 12 May 1992, it would be 
advisable to form a Russian Federation committee for 
military-technical cooperation with foreign countries within the 
structure of federal bodies of executive power. This committee 
would ensure balanced export orders by means of both centralized 
allocations and nonbudgetary resources; fulfill the functions of 
licensing arms exports (and imports); coordinate the activity of 
financial-industrial groups both here and on the foreign market; 
and promote Russian producers' inclusion in the system of 
international integration relating to the defense industry, 
which would, of course, help to give our arms and 
military-technical goods access to world markets. 
  In addition, in my view, greater powers to fulfill these 
functions must be given to the Defense Ministry, as a general 
buyer of arms and military equipment. The military department 
has all the structures for this. 
  The Defense Ministry is in a better position than anyone to 
influence regional policy through its developed network of 
military missions. This does not mean that military attaches 
must become traders. But they can do a perfectly professional 
job of selecting clients, checking out their honesty and ability 
to pay, and analyzing in which markets we are threatened with 
losing our positions and which weapons are needed by which 
country at any given point in time. 
  More vigorous, bold efforts must be made to sell combat 
equipment from Defense Ministry stocks. It is cheaper and is 
snapped up in markets where we have influence. As is right and 
proper, 70 percent of the profits would be used to tackle social 
problems, and the remaining 30 percent to update arms and 
finance the defense order. It is estimated that 30 percent of 
the proceeds from the sale of one tank would be sufficient to 
build three or four new tanks. As is well known, the 
"Voyentekh" State Company, set up on the Defense Ministry's 
initiative and approved by the Russian president, is responsible 
for selling combat equipment and arms from military department 
stocks. 
  [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, the various directions in 
which the economic reforms could continue are currently being 
debated in the press. I would like to hear your point of view 
on the subject. 
  [Temerko] As far as defense production is concerned, 
strictly speaking, no reforms are being undertaken at present. 
There is just an ad hoc response to the various situations that 
arise. A situation arose with bad debts and mutual nonpayments, 
to which there was a response. But even that was half-hearted. 
  The defense industry can and wants to produce modern weapons 
systems, but the appropriate conditions must be created for it 
to do this, instead of forcing it to engage in nonspecialized 
conversion. The Defense Ministry and the government have 
already taken some strategic steps in this direction. The basic 
principles of a military doctrine and an arms program have been 
drawn up and adopted. In this particular case, 
military-technical cooperation should be regarded as an 
inalienable part of the government's economic reforms. 
  If we are really concerned about preserving the unique 
scientific and technical potential of the defense complex and 
restoring its former glory and might, all opportunities must be 
taken at all levels. There are no ready-made solutions for 
extricating the defense industry from crisis, and there never 
will be.

<F P=106> [Report from Gazprom Information-Advertising Center: </F>
"Gazprom Knows the Sense in Missiles"] 
  [Text] A delegation from the Russian Joint Stock Company 
[RAO] Gazprom headed by chairman of the board R. Vyakhirev 
visited the Perm design and production joint stock companies 
Aviyadvigatel and Permskiye Motory, the Iskra 
scientific-production association and one of the city's 
machinebuilding enterprises. Until recently these converted 
enterprises worked on orders from the defense and aviation 
industries, producing engines for military and civilian 
designation as well as missile equipment. 
  Last year RAO Gazprom and the Perm enterprises concluded a 
three-year agreement on the development and experimental 
production, on the basis of aviation engines, of gas pumping 
units with a 12MVt capacity and a coefficient of useful service 
life of more than 34 percent. 
  Beginning in the 1970's the gas industry used aviation 
engines as drive pumps at gas compressor stations of the main 
gas pipelines. However, at that time Gazprom used old equipment 
which had already exhausted its flight resources and which had 
low technical-economic indicators. During its visit to Perm the 
Gazprom delegation reviewed the experimental gas pumping unit 
models working at one of the gas pumping stations under Perm and 
discussed the course of further work on developing and 
implementing production of these units with the leadership of 
the Perm enterprises and design bureaus. 
  Production of this equipment ordered by Gazprom at Perm 
enterprises will allow for carrying out reconstruction at the 
currently existing compressor stations. As a result, the 
productivity of the mainline gas pipelines will increase 15-20 
percent, waste of gas will drop and expenses for repair work 
will decrease. 
  In addition, the orders from RAO Gazprom will allow the Perm 
enterprises to maintain their scientific and technical 
potential. Purchases of imported equipment will decrease as a 
whole for each sector.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson: "Eternal `Soyuz' -- Today Marks </F>
the 25th Anniversary of the First Docking in Orbit"] 
  [Text] Strictly speaking, 1969 became the Year of the Moon 
because on the evening of 20 July Neil Armstrong strode across 
the basalt of the Mare Tranquillitatis and the Americans finally 
broke ahead in the space race. 
  In addition, January 1969 was the apotheosis of our 
country's 
lunar program. The unmanned Zonds were launched to the moon, one 
after another; it was necessary to overtake the Americans, the 
first to send an astronaut flying around the moon. And another 
modification of this same ship, designated the Soyuz, had to be 
tested in circumterrestrial orbit on an accelerated schedule. 
  The Korolev Design Bureau began to work on the Soyuz -- a 
lunar ship and the future universal "carrier" -- virtually 
simultaneously with the successful flights of the first 
cosmonauts. On 23 April 1967 -- 1 1/2 years prior to the first 
manned Apollo flight -- Vladimir Komarov piloted the first 
Soyuz. On the very next day the "solemn tribute" to the 
anniversary of Lenin's birth ended in a tragedy. The Soyuz was 
hastily prepared for launching and it was launched (an 
unprecedented act!) despite the categorical refusal of Vasiliy 
Mishin, replacing Korolev, and it literally "came apart at the 
seams." Engineer-colonel Vladimir Komarov perished. 
  For 1 1/2 years the Soyuz stuck in the mind. Yuriy Gagarin 
was forbidden to fly in the second vehicle. And in October 1968, 
this time without linking it to glorious anniversaries, Georgiy 
Beregovoy, an assault aircraft pilot during the Great Fatherland 
War, successfully landed the third Soyuz. To be sure, prior to 
this not being able to dock the ship with the automatic Soyuz 2. 
  It all boiled down to this; not being able to perform 
docking 
in orbit, it was better not to push on to the moon. Both Soviet 
and American lunar ships while "in flight" had to link up with 
the cabin with cosmonauts or astronauts "lifting off" from the 
moon. If a docking did not take place, only a miracle could save 
those who had trodden on the moon. Accordingly, on our country's 
lunar ship the docking system was simplified to the limit. The 
pilot of the lunar Soyuz in one way or another had to insert the 
docking unit shaft into one of several openings in the receiving 
unit, the "meat grinder," as the strange holey structure was 
called, of the lunar cabin. After linking of the ships the lunar 
cabin pilot returned "home" through open space. 
  This had to be done by Aleksey Yeliseyev and Yevgeniy 
Khrunov 
on 15 January. They put into orbit the Soyuz 5 under the command 
of Boris Volynov, and there Vladimir Shatalov already waited in 
the Soyuz 4. 
  Unfortunately, we can visualize the world's first docking of 
two manned ships only from drawings and models. It is easy to 
understand that there was no one to photograph the cosmonauts 
creeping along the handrails. It was decided to correct this 
during the next launchings. Three Soyuz ships -- 11, 12 and 13 
-- were launched in October 1969 with an interval of one day. 
Two of them were to make a docking, whereas the third was to 
approach them as close as possible and survey all the 
"acrobatics." Alas, the ships could not approach one another and 
the attainments of the "cosmic escadrille," in addition to a 
hitherto unprecedented "population density" in orbit, were 
limited to the world's first welding experiment in space, which 
was performed by Valeriy Kubasov. 
  The first docking was a happy event for its participants. 
None of them, other than Yevgeniy Khrunov (who, according to 
some information, headed a secret detachment of cosmonauts for 
flights in the Spiral spaceplane), never again headed into 
space. Boris Volynov became a strong commander of a detachment 
of a new group of cosmonauts. Vladimir Shatalov received the 
stars of a general and headed the training of Soviet cosmonauts. 
Aleksey Yeliseyev directed flights at the Flight Control Center, 
but later at Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman. 
  Although the Soyuz did not deliver cosmonauts to the moon, 
it 
remained virtually "eternal." Thereafter it was repeatedly 
modified -- it was designated the Soyuz T and the Soyuz TM; was 
launched in a cargo variant as the Progress; as a small module 
for orbital stations under the name Gamma. It remains on line 
even now, delivering cosmonauts to the Mir station. And the 
Americans, who have successfully developed and operated the 
heavy Space Shuttle, proceeding right up to construction of the 
Freedom orbital station, have begun to negotiate with the 
Russian NPO Energiya on use of the Soyuz as a rescue ship.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Chernobrov: "Collision in Space"] </F>
  [Text] When the image on the television screens sharply 
trembled the surface personnel at the Flight Control Center at 
once held their breath. What our cosmonauts in orbit felt at 
this moment only they know. The Soyuz TM-17 spaceship at an 
altitude 300 km had collided with the Mir orbital complex. Such 
accidents, before this described only in science fiction and not 
happening except in one's dreams, are extremely dangerous 
because a ship, experiencing rupture, very rapidly loses its 
air, which results in the inevitable death of the crew. It goes 
without saying that the air does not instantaneously escape into 
space and the crew for their salvation is left a safety window 
from 1-2 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size of 
the rupture and the air volume in the cabin. 
  The cosmonauts, who, as is well known, are characterized by 
excellent reflexes, at the time of the collision already were in 
spacesuits and so it was that they only had to lift up an arm, 
make the helmet tight and make their airtight gloves secure. The 
variant of a landing in a depressurized ship had already been 
repeatedly practiced (the death of a crew of three men in 1971 
due to the depressurization of the Soyuz 11 descent module had 
been able to teach us something), but no one could guarantee 
that the descent module would not itself be damaged during a 
collision. Incidentally, the principal impact on the Soyuz 
occurred precisely on the thick heat insulation of the skin of 
this compartment. And, happily, after this no one heard the 
ominous whistling of air. The walls of both vehicles withstood 
the impact... 
  As the specialists at the Flight Control Center informed us, 
for several minutes the Soyuz landing was in question. Then when 
it became clear that the heat insulation had not been damaged 
(which would have threatened ship burnup during descent) and 
that the impact did not extend through to the cover of the 
parachute compartment (otherwise it could have jammed) it was 
decided to land the Soyuz TM-17. This also was done beautifully. 
  "Information on what occurred will be analyzed by a special 
technical commission, which also will draw the necessary 
conclusions concerning the possible consequences of a 
collision," declared Aleksandr Serebrov, the expedition's 
engineer, immediately upon return. In the opinion of the 
cosmonauts who had been in orbit, the station, leaving aside a 
brief shutdown of the gyrodynes, also did not suffer, and as was 
planned, will be able to exist right up to the putting of the 
first functional units of the Alpha station into orbit. 
According to preliminary information, the reason for the 
collision was the untimely switching from automatic to manual 
control at a time when the Soyuz began to rotate slowly near the 
Kristall module. The crew intended to fly around the station for 
an inspection, but feeling the jolt fired the orientation 
engines and moved away.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Chernyshev, under the rubric "Details": "Was </F>
the Incident in Space an Accident? Awards Were Given Before the 
State Commission Drew Its Conclusions"] 
  [Text] While the State Commission is still in session 
investigating the recent incident in space in which Vasiliy 
Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who had turned over the reins 
to the new inhabitants of Mir, almost rammed their old living 
quarters as they flew by it after undocking the transport craft 
from the station, the cosmonauts have already been given high 
state awards for the flight. It's the opinion of specialists 
from the Control Center that it would have been more logical to 
wait until the investigation ended: what if the main cause for 
the incident was pilot error? The plan for time immemorial after 
the transport craft undocks from Mir has been that it fly around 
the station to inspect the exterior, says Viktor Blagov, the 
deputy flight director. During the fly-around, the transport 
craft got too close to the station. It seems that a light, 
glancing blow occurred. The response of the crew of Vasiliy 
Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov was adequate. 
  "Had it been otherwise, would the result of the collision 
have been different?" 
  "It would have been about the same." 
  At worst, the station would have been punctured, which still 
wouldn't have meant a tragic outcome. Orbital craft are designed 
the way submarines are, that is, they're made up of sealed 
compartments. The arguments of the specialists are, perhaps, 
convincing, but also contradictory: according to the first 
reports from the Control Center, the problem involved possible 
damage to the docking assembly; then it was a glancing blow; and 
finally the most recent version -- no collision occurred at all. 
The most surprising thing about the story is that the people 
directly involved in it have, to this day, no information at all. 
  "There are some interpretations of the telemetry, but 
nobody's telling us anything about it," said Aleksandr Serebrov 
in a telephone conversation. 
  At NPO Energiya, to this day there are several versions of 
what happened. There was a collision, reports one specialist who 
should know, but they haven't been able to determine exactly 
where Mir was hit. In a fly-around the station by the new crew, 
no damage was seen. But just to make sure, a plan is being drawn 
up for the cosmonauts to make an EVA to make a careful 
inspection of the exterior. 
  Technical problems, errors in planning, irresponsible 
actions 
by those executing tasks -- all those things are cropping up in 
this country's spaceflight and are approaching critical mass. 
  Physician German Arzamazov, on the eve of the fifteenth 
mission to the Mir orbital station, caused a scandal and quit 
his job in the backup crew. The always emotionally reserved 
mission director Vladimir Solovyev has announced that the 
Control Center in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow is having to do 
extra work because the most basic order is lacking at Baykonur.

"Russian Cosmonaut Aboard the `Shuttle': Sergey Krikalev Becomes 
a Full-Fledged Member of the Crew"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, 3 February, the Russian cosmonaut 
Sergey Krikalev is to be sent into space aboard the "space 
shuttle" Discovery. 
  Our cosmonauts have not met with the Americans in orbit 
since 
the joint flight of Soyuz and Apollo in 1975. Although a joint 
Shuttle-Salyut flight was planned after Soyuz-Apollo, the 
agreement was cancelled because of a worsening of the political 
climate, and the meeting of the cosmonauts and astronauts in 
orbit was postponed indefinitely. 
  After the Soviet-American "handshake in orbit," cosmonauts 
from the entire socialist camp went into space aboard the 
Soyuzes. The American Shuttle crews included specialists not 
only from Western Europe, but also from Mexico and Saudi Arabia. 
  Sergey Krikalev, however, will not be a "diplomatic 
representative" of Russia in the intensely working crew. An 
engineer from NPO Energiya, an acrobatic pilot, and an 
experienced specialist in EVAs, Krikalev is departing on the 
flight as a full-fledged crew member -- a flight program 
specialist. The five astronauts and one cosmonaut are to place 
into orbit a platform for growing ultrapure semiconductor 
crystals and then bring it back aboard Discovery after 
completion of the experiments. 
  Krikalev trained for a little more than a year in the 
American Johnson Space Center, working with the Shuttle's remote 
manipulator. Now, using the "mechanical arm," he is to get the 
saucerlike platform from the cargo bay of the craft and bring it 
back later. "It's similar to the manual control of the Soyuz," 
Krikalev said, speaking of the work with the manipulator. "They 
say you `fly' the `arm' more than you control it." In the words 
of cosmonaut-astronaut Krikalev, you can generally acquire the 
skills for working with such manipulators by even, well, playing 
computer games -- racing airplanes or a "digger" on the screen. 
There it is -- the benefit of the "dandyization" of society! 
  In addition to the work with the "flying saucers," the crew 
will work in the commercial laboratory Spacelab, which is set up 
in the cargo bay. Spacelab is a fairly small additional 
compartment that roughly doubles the usable space of the Shuttle 
cabin. Of course, the weeklong flight with such an "add-on" 
can't be compared with ever so longer flights on the orbital 
station. So the flight of Krikalev and the flight of his backup, 
Vladimir Titov, planned for February 1995 about the Shuttle, are 
serving the role of prelude to the first stage of the 
Russian-American cooperation in the creation of the joint 
orbital station Alpha, as they're calling it for now. And in 
1995, an American astronaut will go up to the Mir station for 
three months. 
  Of course, the flight of Sergey Krikalev is no pioneering 
achievement. The launch slated for tomorrow will be the 60th 
launch of a Shuttle, and Krikalev himself has 464 days aboard 
Mir. But the political importance of the work of this kind is 
unquestionable. The Russians and the Americans are learning to 
work together. The future orbital station couldn't be built 
without it.

  [Abstract] The Russian Academy of Sciences Special

25 km from Zelenchukskaya Station, in the mountains of 
Karachayevo-Cherkessiya -- is the largest such observatory in 
Russia. It has the world's largest optical telescope (6 meters) 
and the world's largest radiotelescope (the 600-meter 
RATAN-600). Together, the two telescopes can perform virtually 
any ground-based astrophysical experiment in the optical, 
centimeter, and decimeter ranges. The 6-meter telescope is used 
to study number of phenomena, including the chemical 
composition, magnetic fields, and atmospheres of stars and the 
spectral and polarimetric characteristics of relativistic 
objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The RATAN-600 has 
a wide range of uses, such as studies of the interstellar medium 
and star formation. More than 20 organizations from Russia and 
the near-abroad make use of the RATAN-600, and in 1989 alone, it 
found 14,000 objects. Like other facilities of the Academy of 
Sciences, however, the observatory is having difficulty getting 
money for even minimum maintenance. The RATAN-600 is 
particularly troubled in that regard and has been operating at 
10-percent capacity in recent months. Figures 2, references 2

  [Abstract] Precise radar observations of the asteroid 4179 
(Toutatis) were made on 8 and 9 December 1992 when the asteroid 
approached the Earth to within a minimum distance of 3.6 million 
km. The asteroid, discovered in 1986 by French astronomers, can 
be identified with 1934 CT, discovered in 1934 but then lost. 
The angle between the orbital planes of the Earth and Toutatis 
is only 0.46 and it constitutes a potential danger to the 
Earth. Radar measurements of the Doppler shift of echo signals 
made possible a substantial improvement in the orbital 
parameters, an increase in the reliability of prediction of 
orbital motion and an evaluation of the degree of danger of 
collision during its periodic approaches to the Earth. The 
supplementation of the 136 optical observations of the asteroid 
made between 1934 and 1992 by recent radar data reduced the 
prediction error for 29 September 2004 when the asteroid will 
approach the Earth to a distance of 0.01 AE. An analysis of the 
spectra of reflected signals revealed that this is a double 
asteroid consisting of approximately equal bodies which are in 
close contact. An estimate of the period of asteroid rotation 
made using measurements of the spectral width of the echo signal 
on the assumption that the axis of rotation is normal to the 
line of sight suggests rotation with a period 5.7...6.5 days. 
The radar albedo of the asteroid is 0.08 if its radius is 2 km. 
Its surface characteristics were determined, as were the 
polarization ratio and radar cross section. The asteroid will be 
within the limits of accessibility of national radar apparatus 
at the time of successive approaches in 1996, 2000 and 2004.

  [Abstract] Two methods for satellite measurements of 
outgoing radiation fluxes are examined (with scanning 
narrow-angle and nonscanning wide-angle radiometers) in 
connection with determination of the Earth's radiation budget, 
requiring a knowledge of the mean intensity of radiation over 
extensive areas. The problems involved in processing the 
measured quantities for determining the outgoing radiation 
fluxes are discussed and a comparative analysis of the measuring 
capabilities of both methods is presented. It is shown that 
measurements made with scanners are inferior to wide-angle 
radiometers. A wide-angle radiometer immediately registers the 
instantaneous mean value of outgoing radiation over a great 
area, whereas scanners give a better result when it is necessary 
to obtain a more detailed regional distribution of outgoing 
radiation (in grid units measuring 2.5 x 2.5). The color 
effect arising due to the difference in the spectral composition 
of radiation between the calibration target and the object is 
much greater for a scanner. A wide-angle radiometer operating in 
the SW range can be calibrated quite simply directly in ordinary 
actinometric units, whereas the calibration procedure is 
extremely complex for scanners and must be accomplished 
virtually continuously, a serious source of errors. The scanner 
is structurally more complex, whereas wide-angle radiometers are 
simpler in design and operation and have a longer useful life 
and provide an accuracy in determining budget parameters equal 
to scanner determinations. However, it is concluded that both 
types of instruments (scanning and wide-angle radiometers) 
effectively supplement one another. References 15: 8 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] A study was made of the spectral properties of 
the atmospheric transfer function, on the basis of the color 
tones and saturation of surface features observed from 
spaceships making it possible to ascertain their colorimetric 
characteristics at the surface. The findings are illustrated by 
the results of computations of the colorimetric characteristics 
of the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea and uniform water 
surfaces for the case of a molecular atmosphere in the presence 
of ozone and a molecular atmosphere in the presence of aerosol 
and ozone for three observation angles (0, 30, 60) with a 
change in solar zenith distance from 0 to 60. For a uniform 
water surface the transfer functions always have greater values 
than those for the shores. With the addition of scattering 
particles (aerosols) to a molecular atmosphere in the presence 
of ozone the values of the transfer functions for the color 
coefficients X and Y increase, whereas those for Z decrease. 
When the atmosphere is polluted by aerosol particles the role of 
scattering particles in the transformation of surface 
colorimetric characteristics substantially increases. The 
results indicate that the colorimetric characteristics observed 
from space are dependent not only on the relation among the 
optical parameters of aerosol, but also are determined by the 
conditions of atmospheric illumination by direct solar 
radiation. Figure 1; references: 11 Russian.

  [Abstract] In an earlier study by the author (ZHURN TEKHN. 
FIZIKI, Vol 60, No 10, pp 114-120, 1990) it is proposed that the 
position of the sensitivity maximum of the radiation field to 
OST (ocean surface temperature) be used instead of radio 
emission intensity as a quantitative OST characteristic. The 
effectiveness of the proposed microwave spectrometer method for 
determining OST in the presence of waves and cloud cover is 
analyzed on the basis of the dependence of OST of a calm water 
surface on the position of the spectral sensitivity maximum of 
the field of natural microwave radiation to OST variations. With 
variation of OST in the range of natural variability of the 
world ocean (from 0 to 30) the parameter _l_[.sup]m[/] 
(wavelength) changes from 8.5 to 3.5 cm respectively. The 
limiting heights of waves and cloud cover densities within which 
the method retains stability and ensures the required accuracy 
are determined. Tabulated data show that the microwave 
spectrometer method, applied in the form of a very simple 
algorithm, when the wind speed is up to 5-7 m/s has an accuracy 
in determining OST of about 1C. An improved method is 
proposed which makes it possible to double or triple the range 
of meteorological conditions within which the error in 
determining OST does not exceed 1C. The presence of 
well-developed cloud cover and foam formation on the water 
surface causes a considerable increase in the error in 
determining OST. Ocean areas with such conditions must be 
excluded from further examination or subjected to more complex 
processing. Figures 3; references: 6 Russian.

  [Abstract] In image analysis important information on a 
feature is frequently contained in its boundaries. In many cases 
for the identification of a feature it is sufficient to analyze 
only its contour image, as first proposed by P. V. C. Hough. The 
Hough transform is effective in the secondary processing of 
radar images and this is illustrated in the example of 
identification of linear features. The Hough transform is 
applicable in many such problems, such as in remote prospecting 
for minerals and detection of the tracks of ships on radar 
images and distinguishing the tracks of ships from other linear 
oceanic features created by submarine topography and also in 
detecting ship size and its direction and speed of movement. 
However, emphasis here is on detection of a moving point target 
against the background of strong noise. The tracks of targets 
moving at a constant velocity are straight lines which can be 
detected using the Hough transform. The motion and direction of 
the target track, as well as the current position of the target, 
can be determined by this method. The principal advantage of use 
of this transform is its relative insensitivity to noise and 
gaps in contours. Matrix processors for performing the Hough 
transform with parallel processing on an on-line basis usable in 
both surface systems for processing images and aboard satellites 
have now been developed. Figures 3; references 13: 1 Russian, 12

  [Abstract] The "Okean-I" scientific research program was 
drawn up during preparations for launch of the Almaz 1 
spacecraft for supplementing the results of experiments with the 
Cosmos 1870 artificial satellite. The program objective was 
further development of radiophysical methods for study of the 
ocean, study of the generation and propagation of surface 
gravity and gravity-capillary waves and evaluation of the 
information yield of radar data for diagnosis and study of 
various oceanic processes. The preliminary results obtained 
using a synthetic aperture radar are given. Data from 
subsatellite experiments (from flying laboratories and research 
ships) are analyzed (Kamchatka, Gulf Stream, NAECS, Pre-Cheri 
and Almaz 1/ERS 1 experiments, each of which is described). 
Detailed information is given for the following regions: 
Kamchatka; northwestern part of Lake Ladoga, Duiker Point near 
Cape Town; sea area to west of Kara Strait; Oshima volcanic 
island; Cape Shipunskiy; Sea of Okhotsk to north of Urup Island. 
Among the new results obtained were the following: generation of 
internal waves was discovered in the thermocline (in Lake 
Ladoga), caused by an atmospheric disturbance, and also from a 
"point" source (in the Kara Strait region) accompanying flow of 
a current around an underwater cape; surface manifestations of 
internal waves were observed in a number of new regions (South 
African shelf, around the Japanese islands and elsewhere).

  [Abstract] An analysis of imagery from the NOAA 11 and NOAA 
12 satellites (scale 1:25 000 000) revealed cloud anomalies over 
faults near the epicenters of earthquakes in Armenia in December 
1988 and in Turkey in March-April 1992. No allowance is made for 
the possibility of influence of gravity fields. Two photographs 
showing the pattern of cloud cover at the time of these events 
are interpreted. The appearance of these cloud anomalies gives 
evidence of an intensification of tectonic activity in these 
regions. For example, the geometry of the cloud lineament 
accompanying the Spitak earthquake rigorously corresponds to the 
pattern of faults at the surface and therefore this lineament 
unquestionably is associated with crustal faults. Other cloud 
phenomena included ridges, corridors without clouds and sharply 
defined boundaries of cloud masses. Much the same was observed 
during seismic events occurring in Turkey. The fact that strong 
earthquakes in the Near East were accompanied by an atmospheric 
reaction registered on space imagery inspires hope that this 
phenomenon can be used in evaluating the tectonic activity of 
regions or, in a special case, seismicity. The interrelationship 
of the largest faults in the Near East, repeatedly generating 
catastrophic earthquakes, as revealed in the studied space 
photographs, further confirms the results given earlier by V. G. 
Trifonov, et al. in GEOTEKTONIKA, No 6, pp 46-60, 1990. Figures

<H5>  Space Exploration in the World and in Our Country </H5>
  The twentieth century brought many extraordinary events, and 
one of the greatest events was mankind's going beyond the bounds 
of Earth. Time will pass, and much will be forgotten, but the 
first manned flights into space will always be remembered. 
  In an unusually short period of time, space exploration has 
become an area of concentration of the latest achievements of 
mankind, the apex of scientific-technical progress, and a 
powerful practical means for solving the most varied of 
problems, problems that are often of a global scale. Now the 
space program is making a very real contribution to the economy 
and culture, and it is playing an essential role in securing the 
safety of the state, in disseminating information to society, in 
monitoring the environment, and in solving vitally important 
social problems. 
  In the first decade of the space age, only the USSR and the 
United States had a space potential of their own that made it 
possible to effect the entire cycle from development and launch 
of space vehicles to the practical use of results; now 17 
countries are launching their own satellites, and, by 1995, that 
number is expected to grow to 20-25. In all, though, more than 
130 countries participate in space activity either directly or 
indirectly. 
  Our space program right now is undergoing profound reform, 
as 
is the entire economy of the country. The reform of the space 
sector entails primarily the development of a new concept and a 
long-term policy and program for Russia's space activity, plus 
the realization of new economic relations, a defense doctrine, 
and the interests of domestic and foreign consumers, including 
the states of the CIS. In the process, it is vitally important 
that the space- related scientific-technical and intellectual 
potential that has been created be preserved and be used 
effectively. Legislation regulating space activity also needs to 
be enacted. 
  The year 1992 was a difficult year for our space program. 
Because of the sharp drop in orders for space hardware, 
space-industry enterprises and organizations found themselves in 
a very difficult financial position, and space research became 
unprofitable. The reorientation and shutdown of specialized 
plants for space hardware got under way. The ties that were in 
place are still being severed to this day, and the danger of 
losing state-of-the-art technologies and a substantial number of 
highly skilled specialists has not disappeared. All that, plus 
the hundredfold rise in prices for rocket fuel, electronics, 
metals, and energy carriers, is leading to the curtailment of 
space activity in our country. In addition, the scaling down of 
the armed forces in Russia has resulted in a problem with the 
personnel who used to support the functioning and maintenance of 
the ground-based infrastructure used in the civilian space 
programs. 
  With the existence of those acute conditions, the government 
and the Supreme Soviet of Russia have made decisions that are 
important to the space program. In the law on the budget system 
of the Russian Federation for 1992 and 1993, spending for the 
State Space Program was given a separate line for the first time 
ever, and the average wage in the space industry is to increase 
in 1993 to the average level for workers of all of Russian 
industry. 
  Special agencies for the state management of space activity 
have been formed in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 
Uzbekistan for the purpose of setting up cooperation and 
interaction among the space organizations of the countries of 
the CIS. A legal basis is being created for effecting joint 
space activity in the CIS countries that is vigorous, mutually 
beneficial, and equitable. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, 
Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine 
have all expressed a desire to participate in cooperative 
interstate space activity. 
  Finally, the publication of a new concept of state space 
activity serves as an important landmark in the development of 
our space program. 
  In 1992, the Russian Space Agency [RKA] and the Russian 
Ministry of Defense -- along with the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and the environmental, communications, health care, 
science, and transportation ministries, as well as other 
concerned departments -- created the State Space Program 
for the Period up to the Year 2000, which defines the chief 
goals and most important objectives of the space activity of our 
country. In it, priority is given to projects that facilitate 
the growth of the space program, introduce leading technologies, 
and help to solve the most important socioeconomic problems of 
Russia. The program aims at producing a practical return in such 
vitally important areas as information transfer, power 
engineering, ecology, and raw-material resources. It also takes 
into consideration the country's international obligations. 
  The first steps in this direction have already been taken. 
Among the new consumers of space products and services are the 
Central Bank of Russia, other banks of Russia, and various 
commercial structures. With the help of Russian commercial 
organizations, more than 20 space projects involving 
communications and telecommunications are already under 
development. Among the clients for those space projects are such 
large organizations as the Informkosmos Association, the 
Energiyamarafon Association, the international 
innovations-related joint venture Koskon, and the joint-stock 
companies Global Information Systems, Kuryer [Courier], Gazkom, 
Sokol, Koss, and Ural-Kosmos. Today, Russian businessmen are 
already capable of carrying out such complex projects as the 
1992 space-vehicle flight called Europe-America 500. 
  The program calls for considerable money to be spent for 
applied space operations, military activity, and science-related 
space research. Let us examine in more detail which of those 
projects have received the go-ahead and how the face of our 
country's space program will look by the end of this decade. 
<H5>  Space Communications, Television, and Relay of Information </H5>
  At present, more than 30 communications satellites, as well 
as 50 main ground stations and 7,500 auxiliary ground stations 
for space communications, are in continuous operation in Russia 
for the direct exchange of international television programs. 
Nationwide city-to-city communications, as well as high-quality 
international communications, have been set up across the 
entirety of the CIS. In addition, our country is leasing 
satellite-based communications and television channels to a 
number of foreign countries. 
  In the near future, plans call for the stage-by-stage 
organization of communications via satellite with mobile 
facilities -- airplanes, ships, and automobiles -- and the 
offering of the services of satellite-based electronic mail and 
vehicle-to-vehicle exchange. All of Russia and the CIS will be 
covered by multiprogram television broadcasting. Plans also call 
for considerable expansion of the telephone channels for 
stationary users (so-called fixed communications). 
  The currently existing system for such communications, 
Potok-SV, uses Gorizont satellites placed at 10 points in 
geostationary orbit and the ground stations Azimut, Orbita, 
Zevs, Nauka, and Pikhta. In addition to providing 2,500 
telephone channels, it feeds the first television program to the 
Moskva network of stations and 3-4 channels of mobile 
communications. Unfortunately, because the orbital inclination 
cannot be corrected, the Gorizont satellites, by the end of the 
third year of their operation, shift 2 in latitude, which 
exceeds the geostationary-satellite position norms allowed by 
the International Telecommunications Union, and they must be 
taken off line immediately. 
  Plans call for the development and building by 1995 of an 
upgraded Ekspress satellite operating in the range of 4/6 GHz, 
with a traffic capacity that is 1.5- to twofold greater and a 
more advanced system for control and correction of orbit (the 
program will be implemented by the Russian Space Agency, the 
Russian Ministry of Communications, and commercial structures). 
Those satellites will gradually replace the Gorizont vehicles 
and will occupy three additional backup points in stationary 
orbit. Also expected is the creation, by 1997, on the basis of 
that same equipment, of the Ekspress-M satellite, which operates 
in the 11-14 GHz range, with a traffic capacity four- to 
fivefold greater than that of the Gorizont satellite. The 
implementation of that program will reduce the needs for 
channels of fixed and nationwide communications by fivefold. 
  For setting up mobile communications (primarily, in the 
interests of the merchant marine), one channel of the Gorizont 
satellite relay is now used, which satisfies only 10 percent of 
the needs for such communications. The Program calls for the 
creation of a separate communications system, Marafon, on the 
basis of the geostationary Arkos satellites and the highly 
elliptical-orbit Mayak satellites. The work will be done in the 
context of conversion with, by and large, commercial-structure 
money and the use of well-developed designs. In addition to the 
highly elliptical-orbit satellites, a system of communications 
and electronic mail, Gonets, is being developed to set up mobile 
communications in the 1.5/1.6 GHz and 0.2/0.4 GHz ranges; also 
under development is the Koskom system, which makes it possible 
to use middle-orbit satellites to provide direct access to 
satellite communications channels. 
  The Ukrainian AssoUniti Association for High-Level 
Technologies is developing a project for a system of personal 
communications, Ariadna. The RKA is coordinating that work and 
the support of efficient use of space-infrastructure hardware 
and facilities and the allocated radio-engineering resources. 
  At present, satellite television broadcasting is provided to 
Russia and the other countries of the CIS by the Ekran system, 
which is based on two Ekran-M1 spacecraft (in the 0.7 GHz range, 
the signal goes to a network of simplified receiving stations), 
as well as by the Potok-SV system, which is based on several 
Gorizont satellites (the signal is transmitted in the 4 GHz 
range to a network of Moskva and Orbita stations). Plans call 
for the creation of the Gals satellites for the transfer of 
satellite-based television broadcasting in the 12 GHz range, 
which has been allocated by the world community for those 
purposes; after Gals will come Gals-R and Gelikon, with the 
number of TV channels increased to seven from three. 
  The implementation of the above-enumerated projects will 
make 
it possible to solve almost completely the problem of setting up 
multiprogram zonal television broadcasting for the countries of 
the CIS and to provide regional television broadcasting in 
ethnic languages. 
  The programs involving space-based television broadcasting 
will be funded by the Russian Ministry of Communications, the 
RKA, the Ostankino TV and radio company, and commercial 
structures, with proportionate participation by the CIS states. 
<H5>  Space Systems for Remote Sensing </H5>
  The hardware projects in this area that are called for by 
the 
Program could become the basis for an integrated domestic system 
for global observation of the environment, natural resource use, 
and city planning. Unmanned space vehicles in systems of remote 
sensing and space-based monitoring are already being used to 
compile thematic natural-resource maps and to assess 
hydrological reserves, land conditions, and ice conditions; to 
perform ecological monitoring of the Earth's surface and 
atmosphere; to identify areas of the World Ocean that are 
abundant with fish; and to do much more. Those kinds of 
information are very promising in commercial terms, too. 
  For the successful conduct of operations in cartography and 
in studies of natural resources and the environment -- to 
include requests made by foreign consumers -- use of the 
Resurs-F1 and Resurs-F2 photographic complexes will continue, as 
will conversion of the Oblik military system to meet 
national-economy needs. After the Nika-Kuban complex has been 
built, the effectiveness of photo observation will be raised, 
with the number of launches cut two- to threefold. 
  Day-to-day observations of land and sea for purposes of 
pinpointing pollution sources, monitoring ice conditions, and 
identifying natural features will be provided by the 
experimental use of the Resurs-01 and Okean-01 complexes. For 
purposes of expanding the range of solvable problems and raising 
the quality of observations, the Okean-0 complex for daily 
observation of the ocean has been developed and is being built; 
Okean-0 is now part of the Ukrainian space program. Completion 
of the building, however, requires that organizational, 
economic, and technical problems associated with the interaction 
of the space programs of the CIS countries be solved. Some of 
the tasks facing that complex could be performed with the gear 
of the Almaz-1 complex, which is capable of performing daily 
high-definition, all-weather observation of the Earth's surface. 
It has been decided to develop complexes for daily observation 
of land and sea on the basis of competitive projects. The 
development of the Resurs-02 program has been completed, the 
complex having an expanded set of onboard gear that enables 
daily land observation with a resolution of down to 2-5 m 
(resolution now is about 45 m); the Resurs-Spektr project has 
also been completed. The Priroda module for the orbital station 
Mir is being built, as are a number of vehicles that are in the 
conversion program and are intended for solution of peacetime 
problems. 
<H5>  Space-Based Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring </H5>
  The State Space Program of Russia calls for completion of 
the 
building of the Planeta two-tiered weather-observation system, 
which is being developed on the basis of the Meteor-3 space 
vehicle and the Electro geostationary weather satellite. The 
work to improve them will continue. Existing and future 
series-produced and experimental satellites such as Meteor, 
Elektro, Prognoz, and Oko, which will carry equipment for direct 
and remote measurements of various parameters of the near-Earth 
environment, are expected to be used to regulate the monitoring 
of heliogeophysical parameters and the state of near-Earth 
space. Some of the measurements will be made with equipment 
launched into space in the context of conversion programs. 
Information will be collected, processed, and disseminated by 
the geophysical services of Roskomgidromet. The successful 
implementation of the outlined program will improve the 
efficiency of the use of the Northern Sea Route, reduce spending 
on the geological study of territories and the inventory of 
agricultural and farm areas, and make it possible to predict 
harvests in any region of Russia and the bioproductivity of 
commercial regions of the ocean and monitor dangerous 
anthropogenic effects on the living environment. 
<H5>  Space-Based Navigation and Geodesy </H5>
  Space vehicles that are continuously in the same orbits can 
provide tens of thousands of ground-based consumers with 
navigational and geodesic information. Now more than 4,500 ships 
are equipped with satellite navigation gear that enables them to 
ascertain their position within 100 m or less. That reduces 
transportation expenses and increases the safety of travel. From 
space, highly accurate measurements are made of certain 
movements of the Earth's crust that have extraordinary 
significance in the prediction of earthquakes. The international 
Cospas-Sarsat system ascertains the position of ships, aircraft, 
and expeditions that are in distress. It has already helped 
rescue more than 2,500 people. In the near future, satellite 
navigation systems will service mobile civilian users with a 
high degree of precision and promptness. 
  Up to the year 2000, plans call for the use of the 
dual-purpose space-based navigational-geodesic Glonass complex, 
which is already deployed in orbit, to provide navigational 
support of national- economy users and to perform geodesic 
measurements. When the number of satellites of that system 
reaches the planned level (36), the system will provide a 
continuous global "navigation field" of the required accuracy 
(no less than 100 m for navigation and 15-20 m for geodesy). At 
the same time, also in use will be the military navigation 
system Tsikada, which is based on the low-orbit Nadezhda 
vehicles, which are being upgraded and, in addition to serving 
the needs of navigation and relaying distress signals (Cospas 
system), will be used for collecting and relaying auxiliary 
dispatcher information of the Ministry of the Navy of the 
Russian Federation (the Kurs system). 
  Control of transportation systems of a higher class (river 
vessels, railways, and auto transport) will be done both by a 
system of personal communications (Gonets, Koskon, and Ariadna 
satellites) and through the use of high-orbit 
mobile-communications satellites (the Marafon system) in 
combination with a ground-based infrastructure that includes a 
network of reference navigation- communication stations. 
  Work will continue until the end of the current decade to 
achieve metric and submetric accuracies in space-based 
navigational and geodesic systems. That, in turn, will make it 
possible to solve a multitude of new national-economy and 
technical problems. It is entirely possible that the economic 
impact of that will enable the achievement of cost recovery for 
coordinate-metric complexes. 
  All that work will be a part of Russia's Standardized 
Program 
for Coordinate-Time Support. 
<H5>  Military Objectives </H5>
  In the defense area, space hardware will, as before, help to 
effectively monitor adherence to international agreements, which 
will make it possible to achieve a standardized information 
space for all combat arms, and it will occupy a special place in 
navigation, geodesy, and other areas of support for the armed 
forces. Worldwide experience shows that, without space-based 
systems, it is difficult to count on a high level of 
effectiveness of the modern army. As before, an immense 
contribution to the support of the space activity of our country 
will be made by the military-space forces of the Russian 
Ministry of Defense. They will perform most of the work at the 
space launch facilities; a number of dual-purpose space systems 
(i.e., used both for military and for national-economy 
objectives) will be used as the ground tracking complex. 
<H5>  Science-Related Space Research </H5>
  This type of space activity enriches us with discoveries and 
new fundamental knowledge. In earlier years, we gained important 
data on near-Earth space, on the Moon and the planets, and on 
the processes that occur in the atmosphere of the Earth and the 
Sun. Much has changed in our notions of the world around us and 
about the origin and evolution of the universe. 
  It would be hard to overemphasize the significance that 
astrophysical and radiophysical research from space holds for 
the solution of many fundamental problems of modern science. 
Instead of just the two small "windows" in the optical and radio 
ranges accessible to ground-based observation, science now has 
an opportunity to conduct research across the entire spectrum. 
The current program for the creation of new science-related 
space hardware is aimed at obtaining fundamental results in 
astrophysics, planetology, geophysics, and the study of the Sun 
and solar- terrestrial relationships. The last area has been 
given priority, because the results obtained will make it 
possible to effectively solve a number of applied problems 
involving the physics of the ionosphere and the biosphere of the 
Earth. Such projects will include Interbol, Solnechnyy zond 
[Solar Probe], and Regata [Regatta]. They will be performed with 
spacecraft of the AUOS family of satellites (developed by NPO 
Yuzhnoye, in Ukraine), and some unusually interesting science 
programs have been outlined for them. The Solar Probe, for 
example, which will execute a flyby of the Sun at the closest 
possible distance from the standpoint of ballistics, will 
provide us with unique information about the Sun and the 
near-Sun environment and will perform gravitational experiments. 
  Astrophysical research is to be done from aboard the 
Prognoz-M2 vehicle (in the Relikt-2 project) and the Spektr and 
Nika-3 vehicles (in experiments involving a study of cosmic 
rays). The program for the further study of the planets includes 
the creation in 1994-1996 of the Mars-94/96 and Mars-Aster space 
vehicles for studying the Red Planet and asteroids from 
Martian-satellite orbit and with landers. The next stage is 
expected to deliver Martian soil samples back to Earth. 
  A program of biomedical research will be performed with the 
Bion and Nika-B space vehicles, as well as from aboard manned 
complexes. Much work will be done on the basis of international 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Manned Flights and Launch Hardware </H5>
  It is important to note that the Program stipulates the 
creation of ecologically clean launch systems. In the period up 
to the year 2000, the Proton and Soyuz launch vehicles will be 
upgraded. A competition is expected to be conducted very soon 
for the creation of the mid-class Angara launcher, a 
standardized series of Dvina upper stages, and small Neva 
launchers. Work will get under way for the creation of a more 
advanced heavy launch-vehicle, the Energiya-M, and the 
development of reusable rocket and aerospace transportation 
systems (including commercial systems). Particular attention 
will be devoted to the efficient use of the Russian launch 
facilities Plesetsk and Kapustin Yar. As before, work will be 
done that involves servicing and expanding the capabilities of 
the Baykonur launch facility (in Kazakhstan). 
  A special place in science-related and applied space 
research 
is held by manned missions. Although unmanned vehicles will, as 
before, be regarded as the main means of studying and using 
space, the Program calls for maintaining Russia's leadership in 
long-duration manned missions. 
  Our orbital stations have been operating successfully in 
near-Earth orbit for many years. They have been a base for the 
study of natural resources and mapping of the Earth; study of 
the atmosphere; and study of physical phenomena and processes 
that occur in space, astronomical observations, and biomedical 
research. New onboard systems and instruments have been worked 
out, experiments have been performed, and industrial operations 
have been conducted involving space technology and materials 
science. Essentially, the stations have been integrated science 
laboratories in which man's participation has expanded 
considerably the capabilities for conducting research. 
  In 1993-1995, the Program is to continue the operation of 
the 
Mir station, dock two modules to it, and raise its performance 
specifications to the level planned in its development. That 
will make it possible to use the station's service life in full, 
thereby getting maximum return. In 1996-2000, the operation of 
the Mir-2 station, with a crew of up to nine people, may get 
under way; the Mir-2 is being developed right now by NPO 
Energiya on the basis of the design experience garnered in the 
construction and operation of the base unit of the Mir station. 
Mir-2 will be lofted into an orbit with an inclination of 
65 (Mir has an inclination of 51.6), which will expand 
considerably the possibilities for solving resources-management 
and ecological problems. Mir-2 will be made up of fundamentally 
new modules, including a biological module, an engineering 
module, and an environmental module. The Soyuz-TM transport and 
the Progress-M cargo resupply craft will be used for the time 
being in the first stage to provide transportation- and 
maintenance-related service. 
<H5>  International Space Activity </H5>
  Ever increasing significance in the field of space activity 
is attaching to the integration of the efforts of many 
countries. Such integration enables the most efficient and 
economically beneficial performance of the most complex, 
expensive, large-scale space programs. At present, Russia is 
successfully collaborating with 18 countries in space activity, 
developing and implementing a variety of projects for various 
purposes. For example, in the context of an agreement between 
Russia and the United States, the flight of a Russian cosmonaut 
aboard the Shuttle is slated for October of this year; and in 
1994, an American astronaut will fly aboard the Mir orbital 
complex. Between now and the year 2000, an additional four 
French citizens will visit the Mir stations, as will astronauts 
from the European Space Agency. 
  Still in the study stage is the project involving the use of 
the Soyuz spacecraft as a rescue craft for the International 
Space Station Freedom. 
  The Program calls for forms of external space activity such 
as the launch of foreign satellites, the leasing of space 
hardware, the tracking support of foreign satellites, the 
exchange of space-derived data, and the provision to foreign 
parties of the opportunity to receive those data from our space 
vehicles. Promising space hardware will be developed, 
manufactured, and perfected in the context of joint projects or 
individual contracts, and a mutually beneficial exchange of 
space technologies will be effected. Joint space-based programs 
are slated in the area of scientific research involving 
near-Earth space, the Sun, and the planets; in the creation of 
space-based production of materials, semiconductors, and 
biopreparations. All that will be of considerable assistance to 
our space program in this time of limited funding. 
  Of exceptional importance to Russia's space program is the 
high- priority area of systems-related, basic, and applied 
scientific research involving the creation of an advanced 
scientific-technical and engineering stock of available 
research. For the first time ever, the funding has been 
increased substantially for scientific research operations in 
that area, funding that now stands at about 10 percent of the 
total amount allocated by the budget for the development of the 
space program. 
  Carrying out Russia's new space policy and implementing the 
State Space Program will enable our country, which built the 
road into space, to maintain its status as a leading space power 
and use the space program to renew Russia and make it flourish.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor V. P. Senkevich, doctor of </F>
technical sciences, vice-president of the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy 
Academy of Cosmonautics and the Russian Federation of 
Cosmonautics, and chief of the head department of the Central 
Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building of the Russian 
Space Agency, under the rubric "Differing Opinions": "Where 
Should the Spacecraft Be Sent?"; first two paragraphs are source 
introduction] 
  [Text] These days, even the most deep-seated of 
principles are being reexamined in every area of life. And that 
goes for the space program, too -- a sector that has always been 
the most important component of the domestic military-industrial 
complex. Have the huge sums of money spent for the development 
and launch of space gear been warranted? Do we need that gear 
now? In what direction should the space sector in Russia be 
developed, and should it be developed at all? The articles 
printed here reflect two substantially different points of view 
with regard to certain of those problems. And one must believe 
that there are yet other points of view... 
<H5>  `The Aim -- To Keep the Russian Space Program Intact' </H5>
  Answering the questions of KHIMIYA I ZHIZN is the 
vice-president of the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy of Cosmonautics 
and the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics and chief of the head 
department of the Central Scientific Research Institute of 
Machine Building of the Russian Space Agency, Professor V. P. 
Senkevich, a doctor of technical sciences. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: The space program is one of the 
most expensive areas of human activity. The country has spent 
vast sums of money on "space" over a period of decades. How 
efficient and justified can one regard that spending? 
  Senkevich: First of all, I'd like to say that 
those sums haven't been as great as one would think. In recent 
years, the former Union spent about 1 percent of the gross 
national product on the space program. When you consider that 
the workers in the sector, along with their families, also make 
up 1 percent of the country's population, then it turns out that 
the same amount of money has been spent here, "per capita," as 
in the country as a whole. Here are the figures for 1989, a year 
that can be considered representative because there was none of 
the current inflation back then: 6.9 billion rubles [R] were 
spent on the space program; of that, 1.7 billion went for space 
hardware for the national economy and science, 1.3 billion went 
for reusable systems, and 3.9 billion went for space-based 
military information systems. That is much less than the 
unthinkable losses recorded in many other sectors of our 
economy. Annual grain losses, for example, were R20 billion that 
year; meat losses, 6 billion; and above-norm remainders of 
material values, 247 billion. In that same year, by the way, the 
United States spent $29.6 billion on space, $22.8 billion of 
which went for "military" space. 
  As for efficiency, that's certainly not always measured in 
rubles. It all depends on what kinds of goals are set for the 
space program, and those goals have changed more than once over 
the period of the space program's existence. During the cold 
war, for example, space-related advances were regarded primarily 
as the realm of the technical and military-political competition 
of two systems. That situation existed until the early '70s, 
when preeminence and prestige both for us and for the United 
States began, by and large, to retreat into the background. Now 
the principal criterion is, To what extent does this or that 
advance satisfy the customer: defense, science, etc. The space 
race has moved into the realm of technology. 
  By the way, our space hardware was built with a strictly 
domestic component and instrument base: the Western countries 
placed severe restrictions on the transfer to us of any advances 
that could be used in space or other programs. Nevertheless, our 
designers have almost always been able to satisfy the 
requirements of the customers. 
  Be that as it may, we now have a strong inventory of 
aerospace hardware. We have broad inventory of launch vehicles 
capable of lifting 0.5-100 tons; we have built spacecraft for 
various uses, and orbital stations; and there are in space 
160-180 of our spacecraft, linked in some 30 systems. Their 
operation is supported by a strong ground-based infrastructure 
-- launch facilities, flight control centers, regional centers, 
and receiving stations for space-derived information. 
  Unfortunately, the economic difficulties of recent years 
have 
also affected the space program. Operational scales in many of 
its areas have been cut back appreciably. A system of production 
cooperation decades in the making has been disrupted -- a system 
in which more than a thousand enterprises were directly involved 
in space activity and more than 2,000 enterprises and 
organizations throughout the entire former Union were indirectly 
involved. Spending for the space program in 1991 was cut back by 
35%; in early 1992, before the state order was approved, 
the 
entire sector was actually frozen, and to pay wages (the average 
current wage, by the way, is about 1.5-fold lower than the 
average for all of Russia), almost all the enterprises had to 
take out loans from commercial banks at enormously high interest 
rates. Just a little more of this, and Russian will no longer be 
among the greatest of space powers. 
  That's why recently we've been thinking seriously about cost 
recovery of advances and about the possibilities of getting a 
commercial return for the use of space hardware. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: Does that mean that the space 
program is also entering the age of market relations -- with 
denationalization of property, privatization, and other facets 
of market economics? 
  Senkevich: Phrasing the question that way would 
probably be wrong as it relates to the space program. It would 
be better to speak of commercialization, that is, about 
attracting private capital, with state control, to economic 
activity. That's what has long been done in the leading Western 
countries -- there they strive to comprehensively expand the 
market for the sales of aerospace industry products and for 
services based on space systems. But even with that, it's the 
opinion of foreign experts that a necessary condition for the 
survival and growth of a space program remains the financial 
support of its government. 
  We also see the future of our space program in the joint 
activity of the state and private capital. True, we still have 
many unresolved problems here -- specifically, there is 
virtually nothing of the legal basis that is needed. 
Nevertheless, we can at this point name the principal directions 
being taken in the commercialization of our space program. They 
involves things like, for example, the proffering of 
communications services, the study of natural resources, the 
monitoring of the environment and weather, the lofting of 
various kinds of satellites into orbit, and the leasing of space 
hardware. 
  Of course, it's still too early to be talking about billions 
in profits from the space program -- right now we have to be 
talking about, primarily, the cost recovery of individual types 
of operations and about their commercial prospects. And those 
prospects will depend on how vigorously and successfully Russia 
enters the world space market. Right now, more than 130 states 
are either directly or indirectly participating in it, and that 
is the criterion by which the overall scientific-technical 
potential of a country is assessed, and it would be worse for us 
to fall behind here. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: But do we have anything to enter 
the market with? 
  Senkevich: According to American experts (and 
we're generally in agreement with them), Russia has the lead 
right now in roughly half of the areas involving space hardware. 
We have today the most powerful rocket with a rather advanced 
first stage -- the Energiya; we have what is for the time being 
the only orbital station in the world, a unique compact nuclear 
reactor for use in space, and extremely precise engines for 
changing the orbit of a space vehicle. The U.S. Department of 
Defense is very interested in many of our advances, and they 
feel that the use of those advances would make it possible to 
accelerate the implementation of the American SDI program by 
about five years and save almost $2 billion. In other words, 
that is the actual value of just those of our advances. 
  Thus, even the most developed countries are interested in 
collaboration with Russia in the field of space technologies. 
But on the other hand, they are, of course, guided primarily by 
their own interests -- political and commercial. The United 
States, for example, will obviously try to use the situation to 
purchase more cheaply everything of value that Russia has, in 
the process getting as far ahead as possible of Japan, Europe, 
India, and China, but at the same time not allowing the 
appearance of a serious competitor on the world space market in 
the person of Russia. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: But how about our internal market 
-- will space products or space services appear on it in the 
foreseeable future? 
  Senkevich: The space program is itself, above all, 
a part of the internal market, and it is a big customer for many 
other sectors. Building space vehicles requires metals, 
plastics, ceramics, optics, communication systems, power 
supplies, life-support systems, various kinds of gear, onboard 
and ground-based computers, and many other things. Of course, 
part of the budget appropriations earmarked for space goes to 
pay for all that. In that context, it's very important that the 
space program, more so than any other sphere of activity (save 
for the nuclear sector), use the latest scientific and 
technological advances and thereby serve as a powerful catalyst 
for progress. 
  At the same time, the space program this very moment is 
filling orders from the economy. That involves, primarily, 
things that have already become customary -- space-based 
communications, television broadcasting, navigation, and 
monitoring of the Earth's surface for various consumers. In 
space, we're already producing, on a semiindustrial scale, 
single crystals, superconducting materials, and ultrapure 
biomedical preparations. For example, single-crystal cadmium 
telluride can be used for making x-ray sensors in medical 
tomographs. As many as a thousand sensors can be made from one 
crystal 20-25 mm in diameter. On the ground, it is extremely 
difficult to produce high-quality single crystals; but several 
kilograms of those kinds of materials have already been brought 
back to the ground from orbit. By the way, a gram of 
single-crystal cadmium telluride is worth nearly $1,800 on the 
world market. 
  Finally, a third area in which we're active on the internal 
market, one that is extremely important for the survival of the 
Russian space program and for the entire economy as well, is the 
transfer of space technologies to other sectors. For example, 
the development of the reusable Buran spacecraft and the 
Energiya launch vehicle involved the development of nearly 500 
new designs and more than 100 new materials. Only 20 percent of 
those advances have a narrow, specialized application; many of 
the other advances are already being used in the nuclear, 
aviation, and electronics industries, in the light and chemical 
industries, in medicine, and so forth. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: The representatives of your 
sector have made those kinds of pronouncements more than once. 
But I don't recall anything like ever being able to buy anything 
made with space technology in a hardware store. 
  Senkevich: Suit yourself, there are plenty of 
instances like that. Our enterprises and our technologies are 
used to make refrigerators and cutters, televisions and 
samovars, juice makers and electric shavers. Our sector is 
offering the housing construction industry structural and 
insulation materials, sealants, and so forth. We're offering the 
power-engineering industry catalysts for removing the flue gases 
at heat and electric-power plants. We're offering metallurgy 
various kinds of refractories, and the auto industry, engine 
valve seats made of aerospace materials (this technology was 
used to make rocket nozzles). Permanent magnets with high-level 
magnetic features are making it possible to greatly reduce the 
sizes of various electric motors, electromechanical converters, 
and so forth. Articles made of the carbon-carbon composite 
material argolon are much stronger than the usual graphite 
materials, and in an aggressive medium they withstand 
temperatures of up to 500C and can be used in metallurgy, 
chemistry, and petrochemistry. The antifriction, 
self-lubricating material phenan, which is based on porous 
bronze with special pore-filling polymer additives, remains 
efficient in aggressive media of up to 600C and can be 
successfully used in transportation, in farm machinery, and so 
forth. And I could go on: I could talk for a very long time on 
the possibilities for the use of space materials and 
technologies in the economy. By the way, a special system is 
being created in our sector now to facilitate that kind of 
technology transfer. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: From the very outset, the space 
program in our country was under the strict control of 
party-and-governmental organs in the context of a 
command-administrative system. What does the structure of the 
sector and the control of the space program's growth look like 
these days? 
  Senkevich: Our space program, in fact, has always 
featured a high degree of state centralization in its 
management. But that's typical of the leading Western countries, 
too. It is only because of the immense concentration of efforts 
and resources that we have been able to achieve such tremendous 
advances in going after our main goals. 
  And those advances would have been even greater if, in 
approving principal directions to be taken and long-term space 
programs and plans, the officials at the top had taken full 
measure of the recommendations of the head institutes and 
independent experts. What also hindered things considerably were 
the excessive secretiveness, the lack of departmental 
coordination among the consumers and the developers, and the 
extraordinary monopoly that existed. 
  Nevertheless, the positive aspects of such an organization 
of 
operations managed to predominate. Virtually all the large space 
projects (with the exception of the mission to the Moon) were 
completed, although in the process deadlines were not always met 
and budgets not always adhered to, and the specifications of 
some items sometimes turned out to be below what was called for. 
But one mustn't forget that the deadlines were often 
unnecessarily strict, and the requirements, exaggerated: 
aerospace systems, especially in the early days, were built at 
the leading edge of what was technically possible, and no 
command-administrative measures could have produced better 
results back then. 
  As for today, the government of Russia recently made some 
important decisions aimed at preserving and developing the 
Russian space program as a sector important to the state. In 
1992, the Russian Space Agency was formed, to develop and carry 
out state policy in the exploration of space and to serve in the 
role of general buyer of national-economy- and science-related 
space systems and, with the Ministry of Defense, buyer of 
dual-purpose systems. The agency has already prepared a draft of 
the State Space Program for Russia for the Period Leading Up to 
the Year 2000, the execution of which will preserve Russia's 
position as a leading space power. The program has gone through 
interdepartmental appraisal and is being examined in the state 
commissions and in the government. 
  Khimiya i Zhizn: What areas in the Russian space 
program today have been pronounced the most necessary? 
  Senkevich: The program is based on the need to 
preserve and develop virtually all the main areas in today's 
space sector. 
  In the field of national-economy-related space hardware, 
that 
pertains to the setting up of information-dissemination systems 
(communications and radio and television broadcasting), 
navigation, environmental monitoring, weather prediction, 
warning of possible natural disasters, the study of the Earth's 
natural resources, and, finally, the continuation of work to 
perfect new space technologies and produce valuable materials in 
orbit. 
  Science-related space hardware will be used to conduct 
further systematic basic research in astrophysics, planetology, 
geophysics, and other fields of science. Our plans to study Mars 
and the asteroids are evoking a great deal of interest in the 
world science community. Most of our science projects will be 
performed in the context of programs of international 
cooperation, including commercially based programs. 
  Space systems will also be used for purposes of defense. The 
main job here, in accordance with the new defense doctrine of 
Russia, consists maintaining the strategic stability that 
exists. In that context, it is important to know that many 
military space systems, complexes, and means are expected to be 
used simultaneously for the national economy. 
  The program-specified operations for insertion systems and 
reusable systems will be aimed at the technical retooling in 
that area, one task of which is to preclude the use of toxic 
fuel components and to give back to the national economy some of 
the land that was taken out of production before to serve as a 
drop zone for spent components. The Proton and Soyuz rockets 
will be updated, and new rockets will be created. Considerable 
attention will be devoted to choosing efficient configurations 
of reusable systems and to the completion of the flight tests of 
the Energiya-Buran system. Russia is performing joint work in 
the space program with 18 countries. Some of the services 
involving international programs will be proffered on a 
commercial basis. 
  We hope that in the course of this program, our space 
program 
will soon assume again a place befitting it and will further 
benefit hundreds of millions of people.

<F P=106> [Article by A. V. Ptushenko, systems analyst: "Do We Need </F>
`Energiya?'"; first paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] Systems analyst A. V. Ptushenko, a longtime 
writer for KHIMIYA I ZHIZN, comments on some of the positions 
taken with regard to the strategic program for the development 
of the Russian space program. 
  It happens that two schools have long been crystallized in 
our space program, two approaches to the strategy for its 
development. One came from Tsiolkovskiy, a confirmed supporter 
of the "growth" of the space program out of aeronautics; the 
other got its start in the soil of a new type of armed forces 
created in the USSR -- the Missile Forces (there was never 
anything like it in any other army in the world -- in the United 
States, for example, missiles were shared by the army, air 
force, and navy). The first school always dreamed of reusable 
aerospace systems; the second adhered to the conviction that 
expendable, purely rocket, vertically launching systems were 
omnipotent. Supporting each school were prominent authorities, 
large institutes, large groups of specialists, solid traditions, 
and strict paradigms. 
  Of course, both schools were of the same mind about the most 
important thing: both were convinced that mankind would not 
survive without cosmonautics. But they are far apart in their 
interpretation of the main routes to be taken in implementing 
that imperative. Their views differ on the priorities associated 
with this program or that program; on the role of geostationary 
satellites, which hover motionlessly over a given point on the 
Earth's surface; on the advisability of forcing a manned mission 
to Mars and creating a nuclear rocket engine; on the prospects 
for our country for having reusable aerospace systems and the 
feasibility of reoutfitting already developed expendable rockets 
into reusable rockets. It's too bad that V. P. Senkevich, a man 
I have great respect for, has given, essentially, no attention 
to these very important problems. 
  Let's begin with what is perhaps the most pointedly disputed 
question in today's space program -- what to do with the 
Buran-Energiya system, on which we've already spent, by one set 
of figures, 16 billion rubles [R] and, by another set, 40 
billion. Should we take it all the way, since so much money and 
labor has already been invested in it, or should we do just the 
opposite? 
  In favor of the first solution is a seemingly reasonable 
consideration: the Americans have developed such a system and 
are more or less successfully operating it -- which means that 
we need it, too (we used to follow that principle unfailingly). 
But such an answer seems reasonable only at first glance. 
  The fact is that we don't have the same geography, the same 
strategic position that the United States has. From its 
airbases, it could "get at" the whole of the European part of 
the former USSR with ordinary frontline aviation; but to do 
something similar to that, we would need superlong-range 
aircraft that don't yet exist. That means we have to use space 
systems in their place, primarily special-purpose space systems. 
The Americans, who didn't have that kind of problem, could 
involve themselves in the development of reusable transport 
systems whose job would be to loft the necessary facilities into 
the necessary orbits. But for us, that was luxury we couldn't 
allow ourselves. 
  Space shuttles -- like the Buran-Energiya system -- are 
typical space transportation systems that are partially reusable 
(the Shuttle more so, Buran less so). But there is one essential 
difference. Lifting off from the United States, the Shuttle can 
place a payload of up to 1.5 tons into geostationary orbit; 
lifting off from our country, it wouldn't be able to loft 
anything into that orbit! 
  Our country is located much farther to the north than is the 
United States -- from us to the equator, that is, to the plane 
in which geostationary orbit lies, is much farther. From the 
United States, the equator can be reached at an angle of 
20-25; from our country, at an angle of at least 
48-50. Baykonur (which no longer belongs to Russia) is 
located at 48 latitude; Plesetsk is much farther to the 
north. But a launched rocket, without additional maneuvers, is 
capable flying along an orthodromic only -- a great circle arc 
with its center in the center of the Earth --and the angle at 
which it intersects the equator cannot be less than the latitude 
of the launch site. In order to swing the rocket into the plane 
of the equator, several times more fuel is needed at launch from 
Baykonur than is needed from California or Florida, and its lift 
capacity simply isn't enough for the payload: after all, all the 
fuel needed for such a turn is also needed, during insertion 
into orbit, to initially boost to circular velocity. 
  Let's continue the comparison of our system with that of the 
Americans (Figs. 1 and 2) [not reproduced here]. Both have 
expendable first stages that, after the propellant is expended, 
are separated and fall to the Earth. When the Shuttle launches 
from California, its boosters fall into the Pacific Ocean, 
bothering no one; when it launches from Florida, they fall into 
the Atlantic (Fig. 3) [not reproduced here]. But with us, the 
boosters have nowhere to fall: Baykonur is surrounded on all 
sides by populated areas. All that's left is the desert Chukotka 
and a few test facilities that have had to be dug out in various 
places in the former USSR. Because of that, accessible to us -- 
unlike with the United States -- are only a narrow range of 
launch azimuths, which also means an orbit with an inclination 
of 50-60. 
  Even worse is the fact that the orbital airplane Buran has 
no 
onboard booster engines. Here's how a launch goes with the 
Shuttle (Fig. 4) [not reproduced here]: at launch, all the 
engines are in operation at the same time, including the orbital 
airplane's engines -- they are fed an oxygen-hydrogen fuel from 
the tank. The solid-propellant boosters of the first stage, 
after expending their fuel, separate and drop into the ocean 
(from which they are later removed, put back into shape, and 
reused); the airplane, with a tank, continues the boost. Not 
long before the airplane enters the parking orbit, or so-called 
reference orbit, from which the "orbit-to-orbit towcraft" will 
start later, its tank, now empty, separates and, along the 
design trajectory -- that is, a precisely determined trajectory 
-- returns to the atmosphere, where it burns up safely; the 
airplane, by now flying on its own engines, which are fed by 
onboard fuel reserves, makes its way to reference orbit. 
  With Buran, however, the picture is completely different. 
Since it has no booster engine (we simply weren't able to 
develop a powerful reusable liquid rocket engine), the second 
stage of the Energiya launch vehicle takes it to reference 
orbit. And of course, that stage remains in orbit itself. Over 
time, because of the resistance of the atmosphere -- despite the 
fact that it is extremely rarefied -- the velocity of the stage 
drops, and the stage moves toward Earth. Along an absolutely 
impossible-to-calculate trajectory: there are too many random 
factors affecting it. When the second stage enters the dense 
layers of the atmosphere, some of its burns up; but the engines 
don't burn up, because they were designed to withstand much 
higher temperatures. And they fall to the Earth's surface, 
wherever they please. They weigh, by the way, more than a ton. 
  One conclusion thrusts itself at us. We need not a Buran 
with 
an Energiya, but an aerospace system with a reusable, winged 
first stage -- a booster aircraft outfitted with jet engines 
similar to those in regular aircraft. Such a system would be 
able to make it to the equator, and land wouldn't have to be 
taken out of production as a drop zone for the first stage, and 
the second stage wouldn't fall on anybody's head. 
  Unfortunately, we succeeded in only the theoretical 
development of such systems (something I also took part in), and 
gave up in the face of the truly great difficulties associated 
with building them. But the Americans, who don't need them so 
badly, are about to pass us up here, too. 
  But expendable, purely rocket systems, so favored by our 
"rocket" school, are, in essence, a big waste. I won't risk 
saying that our rocket builders don't understand that -- they 
understand it, but draw their own conclusions. These days, they 
see a way out in the appending of reusability to expendable 
rockets that have already been built, including the Energiya. 
But the principles of design for reusable spacecraft and 
expendable spacecraft are, as they say in Odessa, "two big 
differences." One must pay for reusability with structural 
weight; but for the rocket, the weight must be as small as 
possible -- otherwise, it simply won't have enough fuel for 
boost. The reusable spacecraft must use air (as the medium for 
creating bearing and control forces, as the working fluid of the 
engine, and as the oxidizer); but for a rocket, the atmosphere 
is just vexing interference; all its advantages show up in 
airless space only. So going that route, like trying to cross a 
chicken with a tiger, is useless. 
  The Energiya rocket, of course, could be used alone, without 
the orbital aircraft Buran. Say, for putting large, heavy 
objects into reference orbit. But all the organic drawbacks of 
expendable launch vehicles about which we've already spoken 
would make themselves known in that context. 
  There's one way out of the impasse: we need to create 
reusable systems with airplane-like winged first stages. 
  Some thoughts on other priorities of our space program. 
These 
days, we, like the rest of mankind, need to be concerned first 
of all with solving global problems -- energy problems, 
environmental problems, and many others. Without a space 
problem, they obviously can't be solved. But for that very 
reason, many research programs today, including the mission to 
Mars, can in no way be declared top-priority programs. Life has 
shown how right the eminent American theoretical engineer K. A. 
Erike was when he wrote 20 years ago that the priority should 
belong to exploring near-Earth space in order to replenish the 
energy and material resources of mankind and to overcome the 
energy crisis. The essence of the crisis is not simply the lack 
of energy carriers -- oil and coal; it is much more profound and 
dangerous for mankind. On the surface of the Earth, we can 
develop energy systems only to a certain extent, in order to 
avoid overheating the atmosphere. There is only one way to get 
around that constraint without curtailing the growth of energy 
consumption -- send the energy systems outside the atmosphere. 
There, the primary energy source would be the Sun. With solar 
arrays, its radiant energy could be converted into electrical 
energy, which directional antennas could relay as microwave 
radiation down to energy receivers located on the Earth's 
surface. Given certain conditions, that radiation would not 
interact at all with the atmosphere. 
  As for the planned revival of operations associated with the 
creation of nuclear rocket engines, the following can be said. 
On one hand, those are the only engines that are economical 
enough, that is, per unit of fuel mass, they can produce enough 
work for long-duration flights like the flight to Mars. But on 
the other hand, the same difficulties arise that arise with 
ground-based nuclear engineering: it's not clear how to ensure 
safety and what to do with the radioactive waste. And if we're 
talking about manned vehicles, the problem of a biological 
shield for them turns out to be virtually insurmountable. And if 
we say that a mission to Mars shouldn't be considered top 
priority, then work on a nuclear rocket engine can hardly be 
said to be urgent. 
  Of course, in the limited space of a journal, it's 
impossible 
to examine all the problems of the domestic space program, 
however worthy of such they may be. In conclusion, I would like 
to add just one thing. God save us from converting the space 
industry into the riveting of pots! Spending on the space 
program is necessary if we want to save life on Earth. We just 
have to sensibly and clearly determine what in particular we 
need to spend the money on. In the opinion of those, like me, 
who belong to the school of Tsiolkovskiy-Tsander-Erike, the 
space program represents above all an opportunity to use sources 
of energy and material that are outside the bounds of Earth. 
That is what must determine our strategy for the near future.

<F P=106> [Excerpt from report on Buran issued by commission of </F>
experts assembled by the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy of 
Cosmonautics: "It's Advisable and Beneficial"; first paragraph 
is source introduction] 
  [Text] In early 1993, the K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Academy 
of Cosmonautics conducted an appraisal of the status of the 
operations involving the reusable Energiya-Buran system. The 
commission of experts included prominent figures in the domestic 
space program (including the author of the interview above, V. 
P. Senkevich). The commission issued a conclusion about the 
advisable direction of further operations. So that the situation 
regarding that system is clear to our readers, we are printing 
here excerpts from the commission's conclusion. 
  In the early '70s, a fundamentally new space-related 
situation came about in the world. The United States was 
developing a reusable space transportation system that would 
make it possible to increase the flow of payloads into orbit by 
an order of magnitude and, most important, return from space to 
the ground heavy space objects... Noted was... a technological 
breakthrough in strategic arms that, as with the invention in 
its time of the atomic bomb, upset the strategic balance that 
had been achieved... 
  Of course, in the midst of the strategic arms race... the 
creation of an adequate system was a naturally correct 
solution... Thus, in light of the situation and the realities 
that existed in 1976, the decision to create the reusable space 
system (MKS) Energiya-Buran was a sound and necessary decision... 
  From the standpoint of today's political situation, the 
question may arise, did we invest 14.1 billion rubles into that 
program for nothing?... 
  The creation of the MKS Energiya-Buran represents the future 
of the development of space transportation systems, a future 
development of space and aviation equipment that combines all 
the leading principles and advances of the space program and 
aviation. The creation of the Shuttle and the Energiya-Buran was 
a fundamental breakthrough to new technology... Consequently, 
the money spent on the creation of the MKS Energiya-Buran was 
not an unnecessary burden on the budget; it solved a problem 
important to our country regarding the qualitative and future 
development of aerospace equipment. 
  Second, in addition to the future achievements operating for 
the future of Russia, the creation of the MKS Energiya-Buran 
makes purely pragmatic sense. Its design-and-technology base 
makes it possible to create a whole array of promising, 
ecologically clean, high-level characteristics of launchers... 
  Third, the use of the new technological solutions obtained 
in 
the creation of the MKS Energiya-Buran will have an immediate 
and direct economic impact in the national economy, the size of 
which impact is estimated to be 14 billion rubles in the year 
2000 (at 1989 prices)... 
  As can be seen from what has been said, the development of 
the MKS Energiya-Buran was not only necessary solution, but also 
very useful solution for the development of the domestic space 
program and the technological potential of the country... 
  The reusable space transportation system Energiya-Buran, 
like 
the Space Shuttle, represents a first big step that has already 
been taken in that direction, and it depends on us whether we 
will go farther... or stop in mid-step because of temporary 
difficulties and voluntarily, under the pretence of sensible 
economics, move away from the international aerospace market 
with a vain hope of returning in better times. With the current 
rate of development of aerospace equipment, to stop means to 
fall behind, and fall behind forever... 
  What should be done further with the MKS Energiya-Buran? 
Close it down, or finish developing it and begin using it? 
  At first glance, the simplest and, it would seem, most 
sensible thing to do from all points of view would be, as some 
leaders feel, to suspend operations on the system for 8-10 years 
in the hope that by that time the economy of the country will 
strengthen and the possibility will arise for financing that 
expensive program. But one shouldn't be satisfied with the hope 
for a favorable outcome with such a simple solution. Over that 
period of time, the entire complex of ground facilities that 
have been created and the MKS Energiya-Buran itself, including 
the universal superheavy-lift Energiya launcher, will, in 
essence, perish physically and become obsolete... 
  On the other hand, by making the difficult decision to 
complete the development of the Energiya-Buran system, the 
Russian Federation is preserving the progressive development of 
the domestic space program and the high level of 
scientific-technical potential that propelled it to the leading 
ranks... And no matter how hard it is to earmark funds for 
continuing the operations on the creation and use of the MKS 
Energiya-Buran, it is advisable and beneficial to search them 
out. Let it be at first a small amount, but enough for this 
promising area of the space program to get started...

  [Text] Hardly had Russia sort of smoothed out some of its 
space business with Kazakhstan when it "ran into snags" with 
another situation -- this time with Ukraine. On 10 January, 
after a year-and-a-half silence, the separate tracking complex 
in Yevpatoriya, after connecting with the orbital station Mir, 
was "showing off" in the cosmic ether. Of course, Ukraine's 
attempt--the first in the history of the planet in which one 
state controls the space vehicle of another state -- wasn't 
without excesses. True enough, the people in orbit didn't notice 
that: knowledgeable staffers from the Flight Control Center near 
Moscow assure us that the contingency situation that arose when 
the Soyuz craft was docking with the station, for which some 
mass media have already blamed Ukraine, was caused by other 
circumstances. But then, on the ground, many have responded 
overly sensitively to the signals from Yevpatoriya. 
  The fact of the matter is that a year and a half ago, all 
three tracking complexes located in Ukrainian territory (in 
Simferopol, Yevpatoriya, and Dunayevtsy in Khmelnitskaya Oblast) 
were disengaged from the unified Russian loop for controlling 
space vehicles. And, as we are told by the press service of the 
Military Space Forces of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense, that step was absolutely necessary and justified for 
the interests of the Russian state. Ukraine, which at the time 
was going through the very peak of the self-effusive boom, 
nationalized the complexes and flatly refused to resubordinate 
the military servicing them to the Russian command. But that is 
a necessary condition for the normal functioning of orbital 
complexes and vehicles -- hardware, as we know, has nothing to 
do with democracy or pluralism. 
  So in 1992, with one stroke of the pen, three complexes 
stuffed with super electronics and other "high-tech" gear were 
buried -- in a very literal sense, the not-very-sweet fate of 
the scrap yard was prepared for their remains. According to data 
from the Russia's Military Space Forces, nearly a third of the 
military servicemen were immediately placed on reserve status, 
30 percent agreed to give up their warm and cozy southern nests 
for the prospect of work and were transferred to Russia, and the 
rest declared their oath of allegiance to Ukraine. What they did 
until 10 January, no one knows -- since, as our military people 
assure us, it is virtually impossible to operate the complexes 
"for what they're supposed to do" in unmanned mode. 
  The only exception was the Yevpatoriya Center for Deep Space 
Communications, which was operating as before "in the system." 
In theory, substitutes were found in Russia for all three 
Ukrainian tracking complexes -- not full-fledged substitutes, of 
course, but substitutes that were entirely satisfactory. And 
only the Yevpatoriya center, with its 70-meter antenna (a second 
complex, and the only one in Russia, with similar capabilities 
is located near the Far East's Ussuriysk) couldn't be totally 
eliminated from the plans. Yevpatoriya figures in the agreement 
on the international space observatory Granat, which was 
concluded in 1988, when parties of the Belovezh agreement hadn't 
yet become political diehards. Violation of the conditions of 
the hard-currency agreement would have threatened Russia with 
rather large fines, and so, as happens in such cases, the 
question was solved very quickly and, without any problems on 
the Ukrainian side, agreed to. 
  But nobody made any agreements on the control of Russian 
space vehicles from within Ukrainian territory! 
  True, in the space circles people have long been talking as 
if Ukraine was ready to return to the unified control loop. In 
the Russian Space Agency, they assert that the problem is being 
studied -- in fact, nobody wants the unique equipment that, by 
the way, was created by the entire country (USSR) to get lost. 
And preliminary agreements already exist. 
  But Russian Space Agency officials refuse for now to answer 
the question about who it was "on our side" who sanctioned the 
initiative regarding the separate tracking station in 
Yevpatoriya. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, the director of the 
tracking complex, Col Viktor Dubasov, declared that those under 
him are simply voluntarily backing up the work of their Russian 
colleagues. At the same time, however, it is obvious that such 
decisions are not being made by the officers of the middle ranks. 
  In any case, all the talks are being conducted behind the 
backs of those who are directly involved in the control of 
Russian space hardware. For the Military Space Forces that are 
responsible for both military orbital equipment and all the 
"civilian" equipment, the "revival" of Yevpatoriya was a big, 
and not very pleasant, surprise. The commander of the Military 
Space Forces, Col Gen Vladimir Ivanov, who is also the chairman 
of the Interstate Commission on Manned Missions, came out 
against the initiative. The Russian military feel that all the 
attempts of Ukraine to return to the "loop" will be feasible 
only after the problem of the division of the juridical 
responsibility is solved and a bilateral agreement regulating 
the activity of the Ukrainian space forces is signed. And until 
then, any inclusion of Yevpatoriya is just senseless: the 
Ukrainians will not be able to control space vehicles without 
knowing the highly classified system of codes, but to create 
rather serious hindrances will be simple.

Space Joint Enterprise `Alpha': Will It Happen or Not? Recent 
Rivals Are Interested in Collaboration in Orbit"; first two 
paragraphs are source introduction] 
  [Text] According to the predictions of futurologists, 
a cherished dream of mankind will be fulfilled in 2017 -- the 
flight of an international crew to Mars that will put 
researchers on the planet's surface. The choice of that year for 
the Mars mission was, of course, no accident: that's the year of 
the next occurrence of the closest approach of the blue and red 
planets, during which their orbits will closest to each other. 
But even with the most favorable conditions for the mission, the 
flight to Mars and back to Earth will take about two years. 
  The only way to prepare the cosmonauts for such a 
journey and to be make certain that the life-support systems are 
reliable under conditions of long-term weightlessness is aboard 
a long-duration orbital station. 
<H5>  Two Tactics </H5>
  After the successful completion in the summer of 1975 of the 
experiment in the Soyuz-Apollo program, the American astronauts 
didn't go into space for almost six years. Regular space 
missions were resumed in the United States in April 1981, aboard 
the Space Shuttle orbital airplane. 
  Without their own long-duration orbital station, the 
Americans were forced to be content with short-term "runs" into 
near-Earth space. The U.S. tactic for exploring near-space was 
the opposite of ours, which consisted of long-term missions (up 
to a year or more) aboard the Salyut and Mir stations. True 
enough, about 10 years ago, an ambitious program for the 
creation of the international Freedom orbital station under the 
aegis of the United States appeared, but it was not judged to be 
implementable because of, first, the considerably higher cost of 
the Shuttle flights (by comparison with the cost of the project 
itself) and, second, the amplification of the confrontation 
between two superpowers in a cold war. The latter factor played 
a decisive role in the fate of the Freedom station. 
  The fact is that at roughly that time, in response to the 
placement of Soviet missiles in countries of Eastern Europe, the 
U.S. government officially announced the adoption of the 
doctrine of SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, which aimed 
at developing protective laser armaments and placing them in 
space. Was the doctrine of "star wars" a flat-out bluff by the 
Pentagon? Military specialists still have to puzzle that out 
(reports have already appeared in the press about the 
falsification of results of supposedly successful tests 
involving the detection and interception of ballistic missiles 
by SDI systems). At any rate, even the powerful aerospace 
complex of the United States turned out to be incapable of 
simultaneously conducting work on the expensive SDI programs and 
Freedom -- and the preference was given to the former. 
<H5>  The Death of the `Star Wars' Doctrine </H5>
  The intention of the United States to carry out the SDI 
program was taken at face value by the Soviet leadership. 
Mikhail Gorbachev declared more than once at strategic arms 
limitations talks that the response to the placement of SDI 
systems in space would be an "unsymmetrical decision." And he 
kept his word. Hardly had the Americans managed to make sense of 
the results of the first tests in the SDI program, when, in 
something like two or three years, one of the contending 
superpowers collapsed. 
  After that turn of events, the doctrine of "star wars" 
entered a phase of rapid withering. It couldn't be saved even by 
the extravagant announcement of our postcommunist leader about 
the readiness of Russia to take part in the further development 
of SDI, aimed now at either protecting against an attack by some 
third country or averting alien invasions predicted by 
astrologers or collisions between the Earth and asteroids. 
<H5>  International Project </H5>
  Be that as it may, the Americans, after abandoning SDI, now 
had the opportunity to devote themselves to the Freedom station. 
As a result of the strict budget policy of Congress, which had 
cut back the annual appropriations for the Freedom program to 
$2.1 billion, NASA had to rework the design of the station 
substantially in order to reduce its size and cost. 
  But at that time, rumors were afoot that Russia, which had 
become the successor to the Soviet Union, was getting ready to 
sell the existing Mir orbital complex. When those rumors 
couldn't be confirmed (who, after all, needs a station with only 
two or three years of service life left?), the U.S. 
administration strengthened its idea of building a long-duration 
orbital facility with the help of a number of Western European 
countries, as well as Japan and Canada. Soon after that, Russia, 
too, came to be regarded as a potential partner, and by as early 
as the summer of 1993, a fundamental agreement was reached 
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RKA) on the use of 
units of the Mir-2 orbital complex designed at NPO Energiya and 
a modified Soyuz spacecraft. 
  As a result of subsequent talks, including talks at the 
governmental level, a version coordinated as of December 1993 
was adopted for the international station Alpha, half of which 
consisted of Mir-2 modules. The other half of the long-duration 
Alpha station was to be represented by the laboratory and living 
compartment of the United States, the European and Japanese 
laboratories, and the Canadian module of service systems. 
Construction of the station in three stages is called for, with 
completion of the full-scale assembly in 2003, with a service 
life of 10-15 years. 
<H5>  In Bed With the Russian Bear? </H5>
  It would seem that one could only welcome the agreement 
achieved as an important step on the path to expanding 
international cooperation in space research. In point of fact, 
however, the prospects for the practical realization of the 
Alpha project are far from rosy. 
  First, still unresolved in the very important question of 
the 
status of the joint enterprise created in orbit -- things like 
the composition of and replacement schedules for the crews and 
the procedures for the use of experimental results by the 
partners. The European participants in the international 
project, unhappy about the fact that, for some reason, they were 
not invited to the negotiating table, have already expressed 
their own fears about being second-string partners because of 
the "extraordinary activity of the Russians." The European Space 
Agency is concerned about the fate of the Columbus module (which 
costs $1.5 billion), which is being developed by Europe for the 
Freedom station and which may turn out to be superfluous in the 
event of a further transformation of the long-duration orbital 
facility project. Also showing dismay are the Japanese -- the 
developers of an experimental module whose cost is estimated at 
$662 million. 
  Second, in the United States itself, the reaction to the 
Alpha project is not at all unified. If the president's team is 
unconditionally in support of the new design, a number of 
senators and a large group of representatives are assuming the 
role of ardent opponents to it. The debates in the Senate are 
particularly pointed. As reported in the weekly AVIATION WEEK 
AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY, one influential congressman even found 
it conceivable to go to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who is 
responsible for NASA funding, with the clearly ungentlemanly 
question, "Is the honorable madam chairman still really 
attracted to the idea of getting in bed with the Russian bear?" 
<H5>  Birthday Gift </H5>
  According to preliminary estimates by NASA specialists, the 
total spending by the United States for building the Alpha 
station will be $19.4 billion -- $4.7 billion less than the 
original Freedom project. Despite such substantial savings, a 
group of representatives sent Vice-President Gore a note in 
which they unanimously announced that "Congress will insist that 
the United States is capable of building and putting on line its 
own station, without anybody's help and at any time." 
  At the same time, however, supporters of the Alpha project 
feel that Russia, like the other partners in the international 
collaboration, should not require a cent of compensation for 
providing the Mir-2 modules, which will make it possible to 
build the long-duration orbital facility cheaper and two years 
faster. Russian specialists used to try to address the 
compensation issue, basing such compensation on the fact that, 
thanks to Russia's participation in the project, the United 
States will save $7 billion -- $4 billion as a result of the use 
of the Mir-2 modules, which are modified units of the tried and 
proven Mir complex, and $3 billion as a result of the reduction 
in the number of Shuttle flights needed. The White House 
administration and the NASA leadership, however, have wisely 
distanced themselves from the "inappropriate" claims of the 
Russian side. 
  Acting on the principle "not being too pushy," RKA director 
Yuriy Koptev, in an unofficial conversation with NASA director 
Daniel Goldin, announced that Russian is, as it were, in 
agreement with the "free partnership" for the realization of the 
joint project. That's why the appropriation of $400 million to 
the Russian side in the context of the contract concluded during 
the U.S. vice-president's December visit to Moscow can be 
regarded as nothing other than a birthday present. The hope is 
that that money, intended for supporting joint operations during 
the period of 1994-1997 -- that is, in the first, or 
preparatory, stage of the Alpha program -- will help to keep our 
space program afloat, that is, will preserve a considerable 
number of jobs at aerospace enterprises. 
<H5>  Caution </H5>
  The U.S. congressmen who are against the Alpha project cite 
as their concern the political instability both in Russia itself 
and in a number of CIS countries. The disheartening results of 
the elections for the new Russian parliament are being used by 
them as just one more ponderous argument in support of their 
negative attitudes. And then there's the recent political 
maneuver by Kazakhstan, which required $7 billion a year in rent 
for the Baykonur launch facility, which was built with the money 
of the taxpayers of the entire Soviet Union, and five million 
hectares of desert allocated for military testing grounds. 
  So one can understand the caution with which the U.S. and 
Western European community relate to Russia as a partner in all 
spheres of joint activity, including space activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Morgachev, Vladislav Golubev, under the </F>
rubric "Market of Nuclear Technologies": "U.S. and Russia 
Combine Forces in Space Power Engineering"; first paragraph is 
source introduction] 
  [Text] Specialists are combining the near future of 
space hardware and the use of nuclear power units and propulsion 
systems. The first such units have already been developed and 
are "aloft," and the second generation is under development. 
That field is one of the fields in which Russian firms still 
have undisputed preeminence, which has enabled them to enter the 
American market with their advances and begin collaboration with 
American science centers and firms. The vice-president of the 
science center Kurchatov Institute, Academician Nikolay 
Ponomarev-Stepnoy, who just returned this week from the United 
States, told KOMMERSANT DAILY that President Clinton's 
administration continues to support that collaboration. 
Commenting here on the situation is KOMMERSANT DAILY reviewer 
Sergey Morgachev and expert Vladislav Golubev. 
<H5>  Technology </H5>
  Of the two types of space nuclear power unit under study 
since the 1960s (see the sidebar at end of article), specialists 
(both Russian and U.S.) now prefer small nuclear reactors. 
Russian firms that have been on that road from the very 
beginning have, at this point, achieved a 10-year lead over 
their American competitors, who have been investing their money 
primarily in work involving radioisotope generators. 
  Back in the times of the USSR, two groups of developers of 
space nuclear reactors came about in Russia, and they developed 
two models -- the Topaz and the Yenisey (which is now depicted 
in the external market as the Topaz-2). Those units are roughly 
equivalent in their main parameters, although they have certain 
design features that differ. There are no American or other 
foreign units like them. 
  Topaz: designed by the state enterprise Krasnaya Zvezda 
(in Moscow); conceptual work and some tests performed by the 
Physics and Power Engineering Institute (in Obninsk). Yenisey: 
designed by the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building (in 
St. Petersburg); conceptual work and some tests performed by the 
Russian science center Kurchatov Institute. The NPO Luch (in 
Podolsk), which is involved in fuel cells, is participating in 
the work being done by both groups. 
  It's natural that those two groups of companies are 
competitors --only the Topazes have gone aloft into space up to 
this point (in 1987 and 1988), as have the Krasnaya Zvezda units 
that preceded them. But the collaboration with the United 
States, which has already produced commercial results, has so 
far centered on the Yenisey. At the same time, there is also 
interaction between the two "teams." At present, studies of the 
new models of the nuclear units are being done jointly. 
  Russian firms also enjoy a large advantage in work being 
done 
in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles. That work, 
which was being done intensely in the USSR in the '60s and '70s, 
is continuing now, albeit on a much smaller scale. Low-thrust 
jet engines, which can be used for maneuvering vehicles in 
orbit, already exist in actuality in the form of experimental 
models. 
  Russian organizations now involved (or once involved) 
in the field of nuclear engines for space vehicles: the science 
center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), NPO Energiya (Kaliningrad), 
Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes (Moscow), the 
Design Bureau of Chemical Machine Building (Voronezh), the 
Physics and Power Engineering Institute (Obninsk), NPO Luch 
(Podolsk), the Scientific Research Design Institute of Power 
Engineering (Moscow). Some of the work has been done at the 
Semipalatinsk testing grounds (Combined expedition of NPO Luch, 
the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes, and the 
Kurchatov Institute); at present, the status of the facilities 
at the testing grounds is the subject of talks between Russia 
and Kazakhstan. 
<H5>  Commerce </H5>
  The good sense of a collaboration with the United States on 
nuclear power units and nuclear engines for space is evident. 
For the Russian firms, it represents the receipt of the first 
tens of millions of dollars and the prospect of larger 
contracts. For the American agencies, it represents an 
opportunity to cut spending on military and civilian space 
programs (the program under discussion now for the creation of a 
new nuclear reactor could cost nearly $1 billion; the program 
associated with a mission to Mars, $200 billion). For American 
firms, it represents an opportunity to reduce the costs of 
operations, which would enable them to "breach" their government 
funding. There's also interest on the part of potential 
commercial users of nuclear energy sources for space (the 
Motorola company). 
  The U.S. administration, which is treating space programs 
with a good deal of reserve, has still not made a decision about 
the full-scale funding of the program for the nuclear power 
unit, and certainly not about the Mars program or the nuclear 
engines for it -- even though in NASA circles and American 
aerospace firms right now, people are trying to move the idea of 
a mission to Mars, which only recently was considered totally 
science fiction, to a practical plane. At the same time, 
however, a number of companies (such as Space Power, Rockwell 
International, General Atomic, Aeroget, General Electric, 
Westinghouse, Grumman, Thermo Electron, Rasor Associates, 
Teledyne, TRW, Martin Marietta, and POD Associates) are 
conducting research in both areas. 
  Russian firms are being brought in on the work on nuclear 
power units through the firm International Energy Technologies 
(INERTEC). 
  The INERTEC company was set up, on the Russian side, by 
the science center Kurchatov Institute (Moscow), the Central 
Design Bureau of Machine Building (St. Petersburg), NPO Luch 
(Podolsk), and the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal 
Processes (Moscow) and, on the U.S. side, by the International 
Scientific Products (ISP) firm. In turn, ISP was created by four 
American science centers (including the well-known Los Alamos 
Labs and Phillips). 
  At present, several contracts exist between the Russian 
firms 
and ISP. In the context of one of them, two Yenisey (Topaz-2) 
reactors are at a laboratory center of Phillips, where ISP 
specialists are conducting stand tests of them. The units were 
delivered to the United States without a fuel charge, for 
temporary use and on the condition that the right of property 
belongs to the Russian firms, with no transfer to the United 
States of technology or right to open the units. According to 
that contract, the Russian firms received $13 million (funding 
was by the U.S. Department of Defense); under discussion is the 
delivery for temporary use of four more units, which could bring 
in an additional $20 million (the customer could be a different 
agency). In another contract, several series of tests are being 
conducted on a stand belonging to the Institute of Nuclear 
Reactors of the Kurchatov Institute center. The final point of 
that stage consists of flight tests of the Yenisey and several 
maneuvering engines -- including those developed by the 
Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Processes and the 
Kurchatov Institute -- on an experimental satellite that is to 
be launched some time in 1995-1996.

  If things get as far as the opening in the United States of 
a 
full-scale program on a nuclear power unit, the Russian 
contracting parties have some big opportunities to take part in 
that program, and the amount covered by the contracts could be 
on the order of as much as $100 million. At present, in yet 
another contract, Russian firms that are members of INERTEC are 
participating in preliminary studies of a reactor of higher 
power (see the table below).

  Joint work -- although on a very small scale for now -- has 
begun on nuclear sustainer engines: the Kurchatov Institute is 
collaborating in that area with Rockwell International and 
Aeroget. 
  [Sidebar] 

  -  Nuclear power-supply units for space vehicles are 
either radioisotope generators or small nuclear reactors. Work 
on them and other units began in the USSR and the United States 
in the '60s. The first such units had a very low limit of the 
power that was actually achievable (on the order of 5 kW), which 
is why at present the key direction being taken is the "reactor" 
direction. Units that produce 6 kW have already been developed, 
and research is under way to develop new units that produce as 
much as 100 kW. At 25 kW and above, reactor units have an 
advantage over all other energy sources in a key area -- ratio 
of power to mass, with a very large service life (the duration 
of operation). Nuclear reactors are especially effective for 
orbital vehicles with large energy requirements and for 
nonorbital flight. 


    -  Nuclear engines for space vehicles have been under 
development in Russia and the United States since the '60s, but 
the work was gradually cut back in connection with the 
successful development of chemical engines. Both in Russia and 
in the United States, there are experimental models of orbital 
maneuvering engines in which nuclear energy is converted into 
electrical energy for ionization, heat up, and acceleration of 
the working medium. The concepts of a nuclear "sustainer" engine 
with direct heat up of the working medium in the reactor or with 
conversion of the energy to electrical energy are being studied. 
It is felt that for use in interplanetary flight -- to Mars, for 
example -- engine power will have to be 10-100 MW.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson, under the rubric "Space": "What </F>
Will We Be Flying On?"] 
  [Text] If Russia is not the homeland of elephants, it's at 
least the homeland of the most inexpensive and reliable launch 
vehicles in the world. 
  In the past, that has made it possible to save substantially 
on the development of satellites that are more advanced, 
primarily photoreconnaissance satellites. If the Americans spent 
more than $100 million on launching a heavy "spy," the heaviest 
Soviet launch vehicle, Proton, cost 40 million. In addition, 
recon satellites themselves were initially created on the basis 
of the Gagarin Vostok, were placed in orbit by the medium R-7 
Vostok rocket, were manufactured at a plant in series 
production, and were very inexpensive. They were launched and 
forgotten, as it were. Within a week or so, you get a capsule 
with photographic film. All the enemy's intrigues as if they 
were on the palm of your hand. 
  The R-7 rocket, the "Golden No. 7," was developed by the 
Podlipkinsk-based OKB-1 [Special Design Bureau-1] under the 
guidance of S. P. Korolev and V. P. Mishin. That's where they 
started working on the modest Zenits. In 1963, domestic, 
series-produced, first-generation reconnaissance satellites went 
on line. And then No. 7 and the Zenits and some other things 
were transferred to the Kuybyshev branch of OKB-1. Now it's the 
Samara-based Central Specialized Design Bureau. 
  Academician D. I. Kozlov heads it. 
  Beginning in 1957, various versions of the R-7 rocket lifted 
off from Baykonur and Plesetsk and placed all the Vostoks and 
Soyuzes and a good many Kosmoses -- peaceful as well as not so 
peaceful -- into orbit. But time passed, and eventually seven 
tons, the maximum lifting capacity of that rocket, wasn't enough 
for the developers of space vehicles. But the 20 tons of the 
Proton was a bit too much. In the mid-1970's, specialists from 
the Moscow Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine 
Building, apparently not wanting to part with the traditional 
No. 7's, put out the first rough sketches of the 77 rocket. Then 
that rocket became the well known Zenit. It could lift as much 
as 13 tons into orbit and was manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk at 
NPO Yuzhnoye. So it was a domestic rocket, and became exported. 
But the needs for lifting heavy payloads remained. 
  At the present moment, the Central Specialized Design Bureau 
is working on the project for the Rus launch vehicle. It expects 
to use some of the elements of Zenit, primarily the control 
system, to substantially improve the characteristics of the 
veteran R-7 rocket, as well as increase the payload by half a 
ton. 
  On the other hand, special requirements are being placed now 
on rockets in terms of ecology. So the R-7 is running on trivial 
kerosene and entirely safe oxygen, and, except for the mass of 
scrap in the drop zone for spent stages, it's not doing any 
particular harm to the environment. But the heavy Proton, as it 
slams into the ground, sprays around itself what is left of the 
unburned fuel -- nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical 
dimethylhydrazine (correctly pronouncing those names is one of 
the principal habits of student rocket builders). Those horrible 
reddish-yellow chemicals do have one nice feature: their maximum 
allowable concentration in air is below the level of 
sensitivity. Roughly speaking, when a human finds himself in a 
nitrogen tetroxide-UDMH environment, he at first gasps for air 
and then begins to feel as if something doesn't smell right. 
That's why the Proton developers -- the staffers at the 
Khrunichev State Rocket-Space Center -- are making improvements 
on it at present. Before the end of this century, plans are to 
use the Proton M -- instead of the 21 tons of cargo, it will be 
able to delivery as much as 22.3 tons into low near-Earth orbit. 
But the main thing is that the new control system will make it 
possible to substantially reduce the drop zone for spent stages 
and to place them with almost "jeweler's precision." A special 
system will make it possible to combust the unused portions of 
fuel before the rocket falls to the ground. 
  But that's all housekeeping business. On the world market, 
Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energiya International is representing the 
interests of the Proton developers. Whether M. Khrunichev, the 
people's commissar for the aviation industry, would have ever 
thought or guessed what loud company he would fall into, no one 
knows. But the company is not without success in moving the 
Protons to market. In late 1995, that rocket will place a 
communications satellite manufactured by the Space Systems/Loral 
firm into orbit; talks are also under way about the launch of 
four additional vehicles. 
  Things are relatively easy for Proton -- there aren't that 
many rockets of that class in the world, and our "heavy lifter" 
faces competition from only perhaps the American Titan. But 
competing with the R-7 are the Ariane of the European Space 
Agency and a number of American mid-class rockets that are 
currently in use or are expected to be used. It would seem that 
everything is leading up to a real "cold war" breaking out in 
the space market at the turn of the century. But then... 
  "Main European Rocket Firm About to Sign Agreement on 
Cooperation With Russian Rocket Builders!" is the kind of 
sensationalist headline that appeared in newspapers at the end 
of October. As it turns out, representatives of the Central 
Specialized Design Bureau and the Paris-based Aerospatiale, 
purposely not informing the public, are almost ready to sign the 
unprecedented contract. 
  The firms are getting ready to develop a launch vehicle by 
1996. The first stage is expected to be the first stage of the 
Samara Vostok; the Parisians will build the upper stage. As it 
is, the contract is not signed yet, but, in the words of the 
representatives of the two sides, recent difficulties have been 
overcome. "On the path to this program," declared Central 
Specialized Design Bureau Deputy General Designer G. Fomin, 
"there are no technical or any other obstacles." And he promised 
that he would launch a rocket from Plesetsk in 1996. And 
Vladimir Saygak, a Samara specialist in outside communications, 
praised the Moscow officials -- there are no impediments on the 
path of the new rocket. And the events of early October? "It 
took place in Moscow, not in Russia." 
  It seems that the good old No. 7 will still be in service. 
Especially since the now foreign Zenit rocket is now handcuffed 
with large and small problems. On 4 October 1990, the 15th in 
the Zenit series blew up on the launch structure, eliminating 
one of Baykonur's pads. As it turns out, one of the sustainer 
engines broke down. Although launches have resumed since then, 
the pad is in ruins. The most recent Zenit lifted off on 16 
September 1993. 
  In December, the deputy general designer of Dnepropetrovsk's 
Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, Yu. Smetanin, said that his firm has 
orders to fill from the Russian government until 1995 -- at 3-5 
rockets a year; after that, it's hard to say. Yuriy Smetanin 
complained about the politicians -- and the Russians are 
complaining about the Dnepropetrovskians, who are striving to 
convert their relationships with domestic buyers to a dollar 
basis. 
  Again those dollars! We would hope that the Rus project 
will hold up no matter what and that the Russian space program 
will not be left with no reliable "cabs." Otherwise, things will 
be bad. After all, for recent launches to Mir, the launcher had 
to be taken from the arsenal of the space forces -- there 
weren't any others. And the arsenals of the space forces aren't 
made out of rubber.

"Privatization of the Space Sector": "More Than Half of 
`Energiya' Will Remain With the State"; first paragraph is 
source introduction] 
  [Text] The privatization of the enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex and especially of Russian 
rocket-and-space firms has long been the arena for the most 
heated discussions between supporters of the activation of the 
process and opponents. The almost legendary technological 
dissociation of those production areas from the rest of the 
national machine-building complex has already stirred increased 
interest toward the sector among outside investors. That same 
attractiveness, however, is serving as sufficient justification 
for sector officials to shield the enterprises from voucher 
privatization, i.e., privatization that is actually free. In 
that vein, the presidential ukase that was issued this past 
weekend on the privatization of NPO Energiya was, in essence, an 
ultima ratio denationalization of the 
military-industrial complex -- the inability to totally block 
the process of privatization is compensated for by reserving as 
federal property the controlling bloc of shares. 
  One could say that the scientific-production association 
[NPO] Energiya is the best-known space firm in the world -- 
before the other "mailboxes" of the sector were declassified, it 
was that enterprise that was synonymous with the Soviet space 
program overall. In addition, all the contracts for the flights 
of Western specialists to the Soviet (now Russian) orbital 
stations Salyut and Mir were concluded with that NPO. The 
special status held by Energiya in the Russian space industry 
enabled enterprise officials to have a relationship special to 
them -- in November 1992, a draft of a governmental decree on 
the privatization of the NPO was sent to Goskomimushchestvo, and 
in January of last year, Viktor Chernomyrdin signed that decree. 
The document called for the organization of a new joint-stock 
company in the form of a holding company that would be made up 
of the head design bureau (in Kaliningrad), the experimental 
machine-building plant (in Kaliningrad), and the Volga and 
Primorsk affiliates (in Samara and the city of Primorsk, 
Leningrad Oblast). Preliminary estimates put the authorized 
capital for the holding company at about 1 billion rubles [R]. 
  But it's obvious that the government couldn't set the 
leading 
enterprise of the sector "free" completely -- Energiya plays a 
key role in the manned space program. Ironically enough, 
complete denationalization of the enterprise wouldn't suit 
Russia's Western partners, either -- especially NASA. In the 
fall of last year, at a meeting between the first vice-premier 
Oleg Soskovets and the leadership of that organization, the 
representatives of the American side complained about the lack 
of coordination between the positions of the government and the 
NPO in terms of collaboration on the development of the orbital 
station Alpha. Oleg Soskovets promised to "settle" that problem. 
  Thus, the presidential ukase that came out yesterday buried, 
once and for all, the initial hopes of NPO officials that they 
would be able to "buy back" from the government 26 percent of 
the shares of the mother company -- for three years, secured as 
federal property are 51 percent of the shares of the S. P. 
Korolev Russian Space Corporation Energiya (that's the full 
official name of the enterprise). But privatization of Energiya 
(which is due exclusively to the persistence of its leadership) 
could be virtually the only exception in the entire trend 
associated with the setting up of Russia's rocket-and-space 
complex -- a more popular idea in the government is to create, 
at the leading enterprises of the sector, federal space centers 
that would be completely under the control of the state and 
could not be privatized (at least, for vouchers).

"Kazakhstan in No Hurry To Solve Baykonur Problem. Russia Has 
Seriously Thought of Constructing Its Own Spaceport"] 
  [Text] It is probable that Kazakhstan, which a little more 
than a month ago signed a memorandum on the status of the 
Baykonur cosmodrome, has decided if not to reexamine its 
position, in any case to stall the adoption of the conditions 
for use of the cosmodrome. The recent negotiations of Russian 
and Kazakh experts did not yield virtually any results. The 
Kazakh side criticized the proposals formulated by the Russian 
representatives, but did not make their own counterproposals, 
other than the resurfacing idea of transformation of Baykonur 
into an international space company. 
  A visit of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, to 
the United States will begin on 14 February. It is proposed that 
an agreement be concluded on cooperation, including in the space 
research field. The Kazakh leader is attempting to clarify 
whether the United States intends to participate in Baykonur 
becoming a joint-stock company. The experts do not anticipate 
great enthusiasm on the part of the Americans because the 
appropriations for space research have recently been cut back 
greatly. 
  According to the plan of the president of Kazakhstan, the 
cosmodrome will become a joint-stock company of the open type, 
with the stockholders being Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and 
other countries who so desire. However, at Baykonur there would 
be no place for Russian soldiers of the military space forces, 
although it is precisely they who ensure cosmodrome operation. 
  This idea, it would seem, was cast aside because it was 
unrealistic, but due to the project for construction of the 
international orbital station Alpha and the possibility of 
bringing the United States in as a stockholder it has surfaced 
again. 
  The time allocated for defining the specific leasing 
conditions will elapse after a month and the experts plan to 
meet once again in mid- February. Then only a few days will 
remain prior to the visit of Boris Yeltsin, president of the 
Russian Federation, to Kazakhstan and there is very little hope 
that during such a time it will be possible to arrive at a 
compromise. 
  The status of the problem of the demilitarization of 
Baykonur 
for the time being remains at the level "maybe yes - maybe no." 
It is evident that in such a case one of the sides must 
compromise. A more complex problem is that of the amount of 
lease payments. Here the requirements of Kazakhstan are 
extremely significant; the Kazakh negotiations are not about 
rubles, but about dollars. 
  In addition, the Kazakh side raised the question of 
compensation for its losses sustained due to the activity of 
Russia at the Baykonur cosmodrome and at three other test sites 
located in the territory of Kazakhstan. According to the 
calculations made by an unknown method the total cost of 
restoration associated with the operation of the Baykonur 
cosmodrome and three other test sites during 1992-1993 is more 
than 7 billion dollars. Meanwhile it has been established that 
harm to the health of the population has been inflicted only by 
nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk test site. But since the 
moment that Russia proclaimed its sovereignty there has not been 
a single nuclear test there. 
  All this will probably soon force the directors of the 
Russian space branch to think seriously of the possibility of 
constructing a new spaceport in the Far East, the plan for which 
already exists.

Lukovkin and V. Savinskiy, Council of Veterans of Baykonur 
Cosmodrome; "Space Mementos Under the Hammer"] 
  [Text] The veterans of the Baykonur cosmodromes were 
shocked by the news of the sale of mementos of our cosmonautics 
at the Sotheby's auction in London. The fact that today 
cosmonautics is in decline and Baykonur for the time being is in 
a deep crisis are not reasons for consigning our space 
achievements to oblivion. The auction which was held caused us a 
feeling of bitterness and bewilderment. And gave rise to many 
questions. 
  How could such a thing happen? Who gave permission for 
selling the national heritage of Russia? It is said that most of 
the 200 space rarities belonged to private parties. Is this so? 
But is the spacesuit of A. Leonov his own personal property? And 
the notebooks kept by S. Korolev and the manuscripts of K. 
Tsiolkovskiy? Whose are they? Neither Korolev nor Tsiolkovskiy 
can any longer exert control over them. Who then put them up for 
sale? 
  At the auction Aleksey Leonov declared that the "history of 
Soviet cosmonautics should belong not only to the Russian 
people, but also to all world civilization." Yes, this is so. 
But is it necessary to sell our space mementos for this purpose? 
Was it not the pursuit of ready cash which darkened the 
reasoning of some Russian auction participants? 
  Throughout the world norms have been adopted with respect to 
the monuments of literature, history, science and technology. 
These norms also exist in Russia. For example, a project is 
underway for the facsimile publication of Pushkin's rough 
notebooks. This will make it possible not only to preserve for 
centuries a national treasure of Russia, but also will broaden 
the numbers of researchers concerned with research on the 
creativity of the great poet. Was it not possible to act in the 
same way with the manuscripts of Tsiolkovskiy, the diaries of 
Korolev, Mishin and Feoktistov? It also is possible to exhibit 
our space mementos abroad... Is this not an example of 
displaying and publicizing our attainments and a means for 
rectifying the sad situation of the former designers, cosmonauts 
and their families? 
  It seems to us that it is not only our cosmonautics which is 
in crisis, but also our moral values. After all, only this can 
explain the foreign sale of space vehicles, spacesuits and lunar 
ground by some space companies. This will scarcely save the 
space branch in Russia. And if we want to think about the 
future, a national space museum should be established.

Fate of Baykonur Could Be Decided in Moscow: The Negotiating 
Parties Should Speed Things Up"] 
  [Text] Winding up his trip to Kazakhstan, Andrey Kozyrev 
flew to Baykonur, whose fate is to be determined by an agreement 
that Moscow and Alma-Ata intend to sign when Nursultan 
Nazarbayev arrives. 
  Baykonur, which accounts for a third of all the country's 
space launches and from which all the manned programs are 
executed, has today become one of the most complicated problems 
in interstate relations. After receiving the ministry of foreign 
affairs, the Russian military -- specifically, acting chief of 
the cosmodrome, Maj. Gen. Grafinin -- assured him that the 
solution to the situation would be an agreement in which we 
leased, from Kazakhstan, the cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk, 
which covers 6,711 sq km of the Kzyl-Orda Oblast. 
  The cosmodrome can be saved -- that is, not only its 
infrastructure of nine launch complexes and 15 launch pads 
designed to launch rockets ranging from the small Tsiklons to 
the superheavy Protons, but also its unique technologies and 
first-class specialists -- only if it is operating, if there are 
launches. The military department wants guarantees of ownership 
of at least the shipments subsequent to 31 August 1991, which is 
when the cosmodrome was declared the property of Kazakhstan, 
because the organizations involved in executing space programs 
are feel apprehensive about participating in tests at Baykonur 
until its legal status is ascertained. Kazakhstan today, of 
course, is not in a position to maintain that monstrous complex, 
which takes R38 billion monthly to stay in operation. 
  To many, the creation of a Russian military base at Baykonur 
and the status of military specialists for the officers serving 
here seems an acceptable way out of the problem. But Kazakhstan 
could and apparently will insist on the demilitarization of the 
cosmodrome, and in Kiev, Nazarbayev suggested -- the last time, 
not the first -- the joint use of the cosmodrome. Be that as it 
may, the cosmodrome now exists in the territory of a different 
state, and the fact that Andrey Kozyrev in Alma-Ata was 
discussing humanitarian problems and questions of citizenship 
together with military agreements indicates that Russia and 
Kazakhstan cannot resolve their differences on each problem 
separately, but are linking them to military-political 
concessions they're making to each other. 
  But for now, the Russian military who are servicing Baykonur 
are still facing a legal case: operating here in the Russian 
military unit are organs of security transferred to the 
jurisdiction of Kazakhstan; in the city, there are two police 
forces, two courts -- a Russian court and a Kazakhstan court; 
for over a year now, according to the testimony of Maj.-Gen. 
Grafinin, there hasn't been a single draftee here, and as for 
contract workers, he has only 1,400 of the 8,600 he needs (local 
draftees -- who are not citizens of Russia -- cannot be brought 
here for contract labor). Meanwhile, the cosmodrome remains 
almost R11 billion in debt for construction and repairs, and it 
owes Kazakhstan R3 billion for electric power. 
  That is why the military department, threatening to disrupt 
even more the existing space programs, is insisting that the 
combat units stationed here be assigned status as Russian units 
and that the use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk be 
stipulated in the leasing agreement. 
  Meanwhile, possibly the strongest impression on the 
cosmodrome is made by its satellite city -- and that comes from 
the sharp contrast between, on the one hand, the grandiose 
cosmodrome structures and the world-class technologies used here 
and, on the other, the standard of living of those who service 
that space arch. Many officers are hurrying to take their 
families out of the city, which used to be under the special 
guardianship of Moscow and used to be a relatively pleasant 
"reservation" in an impoverished country. Now even the 
asceticism of the Soviet example cultivated in the armed forces 
cannot stop the grumbling among the military, many of whom -- 
first-class specialists all -- are making several times less 
than are their wives, who left for Russia. Those who remain are 
forced to resign themselves to periodic shutoffs of electricity 
and heat and to incredible prices in what is one of the most 
"expensive" cities. A recent survey of officers indicated that 
only 20 percent of them have agreed to continue their service 
according to the existing contract, 30 percent will do so on the 
condition that they receive a higher allowance, and the rest 
would prefer to leave the service. And that when the officer 
corps here is staffed at a 70-percent level, which forces them 
to work knowing that the production process is being violated. 
It needs to be borne in mind here that skills take years to get 
and are "passed on" literally from person to person. When the 
veterans complete their service and their work, that chain could 
be broken. The cosmodrome, over which Russia and Kazakhstan 
could be in difficult negotiations for many long years, could 
fall into disrepair by the time the negotiations are completed, 
and no one knows when it could be resuscitated or who could do 
it. The problem, obviously, is not only whether Russia is 
capable of executing ambitious space programs, but also whether 
it will be possible in the future to make up for the loss of the 
level of technology and skills that has been reached.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Borodin, under the rubric "Problem": </F>
"Russia Is Doing Everything It Can To Maintain Baykonur: But The 
Cosmodrome Belongs, as Before, to a Foreign Power"] 
  [Text] The problem of the Baykonur rocket-and-space complex 
occupies a special place in Russian-Kazakhstan relations and has 
been under discussion for more than a year. 
  The military and diplomats of the Russian Federation are 
making titanic efforts to persuade Alma-Ata to sign a bilateral 
agreement for a lease of, preferably, 30 years and to recognize 
Baykonur as a Russian base, if only de facto. 
  But Kazakhstan authorities prefer a different version, one 
that is more attractive from their standpoint, one in which the 
cosmodrome could become a facility of multilateral cooperative 
efforts in which rich firms from the far-abroad could take part. 
  If that were to come about, it could take jobs away from 
Russian space generals, who, unlike the specialists of the 
middle and lower ranks, would have nothing to command. That is 
why the military are continuing to try to prove to Moscow -- and 
to the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andrey Kozyrev, 
who recently visited Baykonur -- that the lease is the only 
acceptable version. 
  On the other hand, it's generally acknowledged that it is 
the 
Russian military who are maintaining the minimally required 
conditions for the operation of the extremely complicated 
assembly and testing complexes, the launch and firing centers, 
and the municipal and everyday services of the city of Leninsk, 
which has a population of 65,000. 
  Of the R47 billion allocated for maintaining the cosmodrome 
in 1993, the lion's share was released from the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Defense budget. The spending for 1994 has 
been set at five times more (in absolute figures), but the money 
promised is having a hard time making it to Baykonur. 
  In a 1992 interstate agreement, Russia assumed 
responsibility 
for 94 percent of the expenses for maintaining the complex, and 
Kazakhstan was obliged to pay the rest. 
  By the will of the fates, the main facility for basing the 
military-space forces of Russia is on foreign territory. But 
then it's hard to call Baykonur a facility -- it's more like a 
small state within a state. There are almost 1,500 kilometers of 
roads running around the cosmodrome, and nearly 7,000 kilometers 
of power lines. The fixed assets of Baykonur are valued at 
nearly R4.5 trillion (at the prices for early 1994). Compared 
with that, the R56 billion spent on housing and municipal 
construction in Leninsk doesn't seem a very big amount. 
Occupying a big chunk of the Kazakh steppe with an area of 
approximately 50 x 110 km, the cosmodrome also controls huge 
tracts of land that are used as drop zones and right-of-way 
zones, and they're not only in Kazakhstan, but also in Russia, 
Turkmenia, and Uzbekistan. 
  From a juridical standpoint, not to mention from simply a 
human standpoint, the situation that has come to pass around 
Baykonur can only be called nonsense. In the city and 
settlements around it, there are two police forces -- one 
Russian, one Kazakh -- and two court systems. True, there is 
still only one prosecutor's office, but because of confusion and 
the extremely complex living conditions, the staff members have 
announced a strike. In the words of the deputy chief of the 
cosmodrome, Maj.-Gen. Viktor Grafinin, the special conditions at 
the Baykonur facilities for the military-space forces of Russia 
that, for decades, were painstakingly hidden from "enemy eyes" 
are now being maintained by officers that are under Kazakhstan's 
jurisdiction, i.e., they are under the security service of a 
foreign country. 
  According to Gen. Grafinin, there were 22 launches of space 
vehicles with military and national-economy missions from 
Baykonur in 1992. In 1993, there were four. This year, they're 
still waiting for the first. The space industry is gradually 
falling into decline. Judging from what civilian and military 
specialists say, give it three -- at best, five -- years, and 
the process of decay will become irreversible: equipment will 
age, and the people will leave. The unique experience and 
knowledge garnered at the expense of tremendous money and effort 
will be left unused. 
  In the words of one Baykonur veteran who, over a 20-year 
period, rose from a worker to director of a large affiliate of 
NPO Energiya, the money that is being spent to mothball 
facilities and keep them in working order is fully comparable 
with the money that could produce an actual launch. In his 
opinion, three or four successful launches would be fully 
sufficient for attracting well- to-do clients who want to put 
their cargoes in orbit and for providing them safety guarantees. 
Moreover, the clients, in all likelihood, would want to be 
assured that the expensive equipment transported to the 
cosmodrome will not, one fine day, become someone else's 
property. That requires specific agreements between Moscow and 
Alma-Ata. 
  Kazakhstan's desire to get for Baykonur as much as possible 
and, hopefully, the "green stuff" is entirely normal. But 
Alma-Ata still needs to understand that Moscow is not in a 
position to pay sums that go beyond the bounds of common sense. 
Recent events around the long-suffering cosmodrome have shown 
that within the next two months, that issue will be resolved by 
the highest level, by the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukova: "Russian Delegation at Davos </F>
Forum: Forum Calls for Easing of Reforms"] 
  [Text] After returning to Moscow late Tuesday evening, 
Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov 
commented on the results of the World Economic Forum held in 
Davos (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for February 2) for a 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. In Mr. Davydov's opinion, most 
noteworthy was the attention that Western politicians and 
businessmen devoted to the idea of adjustments in Russian 
reforms: The need to "humanize" them was brought up in Davos 
repeatedly. There were also promises to help Russia solve its 
social problems, to grant its credits, and to establish socially 
oriented funds for this purpose. The forum's participants 
stressed the importance of continued reform, saying that the 
pace of the process is not that important. 
  Mr. Davydov noted that the forum's participants basically 
discussed issues of reform theory on the first day. After very 
lengthy discussions and attempts to arrive at the best 
definition for the concept of "reform," they arrived at a common 
view: Economic reform has at least three essential components: 
liberalization of prices and foreign trade, privatization, and 
efforts to combat inflation. 
  But Mr. Davydov saw nothing fundamentally new in the Western 
experts' discussion of economic reforms in Russia. Much more 
interesting, in his opinion, was the attention devoted at the 
forum to the social factor of reforms. Most of the speakers 
called attention to the fact that the changes under way in 
Russia are psychologically and physically difficult for the 
majority of the population. The conclusion was that it is 
essential to ease reform time tables and methods. There were 
also proposals for earmarking several special Western funds and 
credits for social programs. Mr. Davydov said that such Western 
steps are attributable primarily to the West's fear of the 
"Zhirinovskiy factor." It was said repeatedly at the forum that 
this factor "will manifest itself increasingly distinctly as the 
social situation of Russian citizens worsens" and that a return 
"back onto the road of democracy will be far more costly." 
  And so the impatience and interest with which the 
participants awaited the Russian prime minister's speech was not 
surprising. In the minister's opinion, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
succeeded in reassuring his audience. But particular attention 
was paid not to his statements about continuing and deepening 
reforms, but to the prime minister's support for the idea of a 
tough state financial policy to control inflation.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin, Konstantin Smirnov: "MFER </F>
Collegium: Ministry Tallies 1993 Foreign Trade Results"] 
  [Text] Russia's foreign economic results in 1993 and the 
outlook for changes in foreign trade and its regulation in 1994 
were discussed at a session of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations [MFER] collegium yesterday. Judging from the proposals 
made at it, the ministry, unlike the government, supports the 
idea of liberalizing foreign trade activity and does not rule 
out the possibility of abolishing the institution of special 
exporters in 1995. 
  Russia's balance-sheet foreign trade indicators for 1993 are 
impressive. It had a positive balance of $16 billion (which is 
somewhat less, it's true, that the government's September 
forecasts of $20 billion). However, the world market continues 
to see Russia only as a raw materials supplier (primarily oil 
and gas). The positive results were achieved in the traditional 
way, through increases in the physical volume of oil and gas 
exports, despite unfavorable price changes: At the end of last 
year, the price of one barrel of oil had fallen by $14 (changes 
in gas prices follow changes in oil prices). The proportion of 
machinery and equipment fell to 7 percent (9 percent in 1992). 
Although recent signs of an increase in world prices for raw 
materials do not in principle rule out the possibility of 
continued growth of oil and gas exports this year, positive 
shifts in their structure could be made possible by credit 
support or tax breaks for exporters, something that (like the 
creation of a state system to insure exports against unfavorable 
changes in world market prices) no one in either the MFER or the 
government is seriously thinking about yet. 
  At the same time, against the backdrop of rather prolonged 
periods of exchange rates favorable to imports, a policy of 
limiting imports was pursued in 1993, and they fell by 27 
percent. The value of grain imports dropped by 56 percent, which 
is in keeping with the policy of cutting subsidies for 
centralized imports. The sharp reduction (by 30 percent) in 
imports of machinery and equipment was less in keeping with 
targets. 
  The collegium session confirmed that the government is not 
of 
one mind in its assessments of the outlook for changes in 
foreign economic regulation. For example, while the commission 
on operational issues (led by Oleg Soskovets), in returning 
commercial timber to the list of "strategic" raw material 
exports, essentially "emasculated" the liberalization of foreign 
economic activity carried out by Gaydar, the ministry continues 
to favor a reduction in the number of goods whose export is 
subject to quotas, proposing to leave only oil, oil products, 
and certain ferrous metals in the "strategic" category. The very 
likely introduction of quotas on aluminum and pig iron will be 
on the conscience of importers from the European Union, not the 
MFER. 
  One may also conclude from the collegium session's outcome 
that the heyday for special exporters is coming to an end. Their 
functions of ensuring effective exports and state control over 
foreign exchange proceeds can readily be handled successfully by 
tenders based on state export quotas, on the one hand, and by 
the evolving system of foreign exchange control, on the other. 
In addition, the MFER's cherished uniform computerized control 
system could easily be reoriented from special exporters to 
tender winners. This change, which could in practice occur only 
next year, would signal a real turn from administrative to 
economic regulation.

  Commentary: In assessing the results of the MFER's 
activities in 1993, which were discussed at the collegium 
session, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov 
told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that he considers the main 
achievement to be the "MFER's continued pursuit of a policy of 
reforming and liberalizing foreign economic ties." He 
characterized the results as not bad: This applies to both the 
$16-billion positive trade balance and the maintenance of 
exports at the 1992 level. Among setbacks the minister cited $10 
billion in delinquent payments in trade with the CIS countries 
and a 40-percent reduction in imports. Among promising areas of 
endeavor in 1994 Mr. Davydov cited efforts to fine-tune the 
uniform control system for exports of strategic raw materials 
and the solution of problems relating to the participation of 
regions in foreign economic activity. (Plans call for 
emphasizing the institution of regional authorized 
representatives.) Among other problems, the minister spoke at 
length on protectionism, at the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's 
request. The increase in import tariffs as of March 1, in his 
opinion, will result not in the abundance of goods promised by 
its supporters, but in shortages of goods. "We need to protect 
the consumer, not the producer," Mr. Davydov said. He added that 
even in the West, with its developed competition on domestic 
markets, higher tariffs usually result only in a brief respite 
(one to two years) for domestic producers and are not 
accompanied by an immediate jump in prices. But then prices rise 
all the same, and the competitiveness of domestic goods sharply 
falls. In Russia, however, with its high proportion of 
production monopolies and undeveloped competition, prices will 
jump on the very next day. A protectionist policy is also doomed 
for the reason that Russia is simply compelled to become 
integrated in the world economic system. And Mr. Davydov 
promised that the MFER "will do everything in its power to 
achieve that integration."

<F P=106> [Report by Vadim Bardin: "The Ministry Is Busy Strengthening </F>
Its Own Positions"] 
  [Text] Over the past week the MVES [Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations] collegium met twice. KOMMERSANT 
reported on the first meeting on Friday; the second took place 
off schedule, on Saturday. It approved the ministry's plan of 
work for the current year, the main emphasis in which is on 
boosting MVES activities involving the preparation of various 
legislative acts on regulation of foreign economic activities. 
In addition, the ministry will be concentrating in its hands the 
most important economic levers of regulating foreign economic 
activities. 
  Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, who was 
absent from the collegium on Thursday, apparently decided to 
catch up on lost time and held the collegium meeting on a day 
off--otherwise there is simply no explanation for holding two 
collegium meetings in one week. Besides, under consideration on 
Saturday were not some urgent problems but a seemingly routine 
topic: MVES actions with respect to the development of foreign 
economic activities in 1994. 
  The minister's plan of action gives one an idea of not only 
the priorities in MVES work but also of the coming changes in 
the mechanism of regulating foreign economic activities in 1994 
as a whole. Here are the main milestones set by the collegium: 
legislative support for a unified foreign economic policy; 
expansion of the regional base of foreign economic activities 
(free trade and special economic zones, programs for attracting 
foreign investment); liberalization and support of exports 
(limiting the range of goods subject to quotas; development of a 
mechanism for quota apportionment through competitive bids; 
creating a system of financing exports); foreign currency 
control (interactive information exchange between the MVES and 
the Central Bank; checking licenses for exports of strategic 
commodities issued in 1993-1994; developing measures preventing 
unsanctioned re-export of Russian goods to third countries). 
  The ministry sets for itself large-scale tasks, not limiting 
its activities to planning. Already this year, after registering 
a special exporter statute with the Ministry of Justice, the 
MVES brought under its control special exporters' foreign 
currency earnings from export of goods on the strategic 
commodities list (see KOMMERSANT 13 and 20 January issues). In 
addition, the MVES acted as a main lobbyist for setting up the 
Roseximbank [Russian Export-Import Bank], which will have the 
task of providing preferential ruble financing for production of 
industrial goods intended for export. It is assumed that 
financing will be provided for a term of six to 10 years, with 
the repayment rate below Central Bank's refinancing rate. 
Setting up this new bank fills the void that has existed until 
now in the system of state support for exporters. 
  Roseximbank will become an intermediary in kind between the 
budget and the exporter. If we add to this the fact that Viktor 
Shilin, who is still Oleg Davydov's deputy, has been appointed 
its president, and the minister himself, together with Sergey 
Dubinin (Ministry of Finance) and Vladimir Sokolov (Federal 
Property Fund), represent in Roseximbank the state, which holds 
51 percent of its stock, the MVES voice in the bank's operations 
will be decisive. Thus, the ministry not only participates 
actively in the development of foreign economic policy but is 
also concentrating in its hands the most important levers of 
regulating foreign economic activities.

<F P=106> [Report by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Nikolay Seregin under </F>
the rubric "Details": "Russian Export-Import Bank Created"] 
  [Text] We have already reported on the creation of 
Roseximbank [Russian Export-Import Bank]. This is a state bank, 
in which the controlling share of stock belongs to state 
structures. Roseximbank has been set up in the form of a 
privately held joint-stock company with charter capital of 51 
billion rubles. Its stockholders are the Central Bank, the 
Federal Property Fund, the Bank for Foreign Trade, and the 
foreign trade associations Tekhnopromeksport, Tekhstroyeksport, 
Machinoeksport, and Selkhozpromeksport. According to Viktor 
Shilin, deputy minister of foreign economic relations, who 
became the bank's chairman of the board, the need for its 
creation became evident as much as a year ago; however, the road 
from the idea's conception to its implementation proved long. 
The main task of the new bank is to extend credit to Russian 
producers of machinery and technical products and stimulate 
exports. Statistical data show that the share of machinery and 
equipment in the total volume of exports continues to decline. 
At the same time there has been and still is a stable demand for 
many varieties of domestically produced machine-building and 
technical products in foreign markets. Quite often, however, 
producers find themselves in a situation of being simply unable 
to tend to production, since its financing through commercial 
banks, given the current rate of inflation, is becoming simply 
impossible. The Roseximbank will finance real export contracts 
and, judging by all signs, the terms for producers will be very 
favorable. At the same time the Roseximbank will insure export 
credits. In the opinion of the Roseximbank president, the new 
financial structure will occupy its own, quite well-defined, 
niche and will not compete with other banks.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Akimov: "VEB Will Carry Out State Tasks: </F>
Vneshekonombank Reorganization Has Begun"] 
  [Text] It looks as though the Vneshekonombank [Bank 
for Foreign Economic Activities] will finally acquire a clearly 
defined status. Yesterday the bank received the Edict of the 
President of Russia "On Issues Regarding the Activities of the 
USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Relations," in keeping with which 
it officially becomes a state financial institution specializing 
exclusively in servicing the foreign debt and assets of the 
former USSR (and in the future, of Russia as well), as well as 
government credit lines. Actually, these are precisely the 
functions Vneshekonombank continued to carry out during the 
two-year period since its de facto bankruptcy. 
  Let us recall that the activities of the Vneshekonombank 
(VEB) over the past two years were conducted on the basis of a 
decree of the Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium dated 13 January 
1992. In keeping with this decree, the charter, reserve, and 
other funds, buildings, and other property were transferred to 
the Central Bank, while the bank's current operations were 
conducted by the Operational Management Committee. The 
president's latest edict envisages transferring the 
aforementioned funds and other property to Vneshekonombank's 
full economic disposal, while the committee is to be liquidated. 
The bank is headed by a chairman appointed for three years by 
presidential edict, while it is managed collectively by the 
board of directors (two deputy chairmen and six members of the 
council); appointments to the board were approved by the 
Government of Russia on 24 January. According to VEB's acting 
chairman Anatoliy Nosko, separating the handling of state 
functions from purely commercial operations is an absolutely 
necessary measure. Otherwise, there is a great probability of 
the situation that occurred in the bank in December 1991 
developing. Therefore, over the past few years such functions of 
the bank as servicing legal and physical entities, trade 
operations clearing, and other area of activities typical of a 
regular commercial bank have been dropped. At the same time, its 
subsidiaries and branches abroad have been transferred to the 
Vneshekonombank of Russia. Thus, the bank currently will 
concentrate on carrying out five basic functions. First and 
foremost, servicing Russia's foreign debt (including that of the 
former USSR), as well as clearing and control operations related 
to the government's centralized credits and financial 
guarantees. Equally important functions that remain the 
responsibility of the bank are servicing the bonds of the 
domestic hard currency bond issue, repayment of debt to private 
individuals, and conducting in-house trading operations. 
  The Vneshekonombank leadership has prepared a memorandum for 
the government on the bank's conversion to joint-stock holding. 
Its stockholders will be the Ministry of Finance, the Central 
Bank, and the State Committee for the Administration of State 
Property. A corresponding agreement has already been reached, 
and after the final coordination of positions the government is 
expected to approve the proposed draft. It is envisaged that 
approximately in a month the stockholders will approve the 
bank's new charter and determine their shares in the charter 
capital. It will amount to a total of 30 billion rubles [R]. 
Taking into account that Vneshekonombank's charter capital is 
R26 billion, practically no budget money will be required to 
bring it to the required total.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Presnyakov and Boris Smitiyenko: "Russia </F>
Awaits Foreign Investors"] 
  [Text] According to the available data the number of 
enterprises with foreign investments in the Maritime Territory 
will grow by 2-2.5 times in the next few years. They are growing 
dynamically in the Urals region and Western Siberia (especially 
in the Tyumen and Tomsk regions), in the north and north-west of 
the European part of the Russian Federation, in the North 
Caucasian region (Krasnodar and Stavropol territories) and in 
the Volga area (especially in the Samara and Nizhni Novgorod 
regions and Tatarstan). 
  Regions have broad rights in matters of the attraction of 
foreign investments. They may conclude agreements on economic 
cooperation with regions of foreign countries. These are as a 
rule geographically close territories. 
  According to forecasts, the sectoral structure of foreign 
investments in the Russian Federation should in the next few 
years change towards the production sphere (up to 70 percent of 
foreign investments), the priority sectors being: 
  oil and gas production; 
  conversion of the defence industry; 
  agricultural production and other branches of the 
agro-industrial complex; 
  material and technical equipment of business infrastructure; 
  industrial application of the results of research and 
technical development. 
  Following are the most important institutions which are 
being 
formed in Russia for purposes of investment cooperation: 
  The Russian Agency of International Cooperation and 
Development which has replaced the committee for foreign 
investments and the committee for technical cooperation with the 
World Bank. The agency effects the state policy in the sphere of 
international financial and investment cooperation. 
  The State Investment Corporation whose main 
function is the activization of the investment process and the 
pursuance of the state investment policy. The corporation 
effects the entire investment process, has a considerable 
mortgage fund of property worth one billion dollars and an 
authorized capital of 50 million dollars and 200 billion 
roubles. It is establishing an investment bank, an insurance 
company and sectoral insurance funds and plans to set up 
foreign branches and offices. 
  The Russian Financial Corporation attracts, along 
with the use of state investment credits and credits of the 
Central Bank of Russia, funds of commercial banks and foreign 
investors. It has the right to grant state guarantees to foreign 
investors. 
  The international agency for insuring foreign 
investments in the Russian Federation from noncommercial 
risks was formed by a decree of the President of the 
Russian Federation on February 26, 1993. Its main task is to set 
up an insurance system which should grant concrete financial 
guarantees to foreign investors in addition to the guarantees 
offered by the Russian legislation and Russia's obligations 
under international treaties.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Malyutin: "Ministry of Communications </F>
Tightens Control Over Development of Cellular Networks"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 2 February an expert commission of 
the Russian Ministry of Communications ceremonially announced 
the results of the competition for the best plans for the 
organization of cellular mobile communications networks on 
Russia's territory. Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak 
spoke at the ceremonies and announced a number of innovations in 
the ministry's policies, including the toughening of 
requirements for the operating companies that have received, as 
a result of the competition, the right to acquire licenses to 
provide cellular communications services under standards GSM and 
NMT-450N in a number of Russia's regions. 
  According to Leonid Varakin, the expert commission's 
chairman 
and director of the Central Research Institute of 
Communications, in selecting winners consideration was given, in 
part, to the completeness of plans and the possibility of their 
implementation, as well as to the "amount of the uncompensated 
contribution." In regions where only a single applicant 
submitted a proposal, it was decided not to determine a winner 
in order not to violate the principle of competition, despite 
the fact that the organization of cellular communications 
networks in those regions is put off at least until the next 
bidding. 
  As Aleksandr Krupnov, first deputy minister of 
communications, reported, the losers will get their 
contributions back. The winners, on the other hand, still have 
to apply for licenses and pay for them within three months. 
According to Mr. Krupnov, the amount will be approximately $3.00 
per inhabitant of a region. It is planned to spend the money 
thus collected to prepare regions' infrastructures for the 
development of cellular networks. 
  Companies that won the competition must start offering 
cellular communications services before 2 February 1995. 
Otherwise, according to Mr. Bulgak, the operators will lose 
their license. Another example of the tightened controls over 
the development of cellular communications networks in Russia 
that the minister of communications announced will be the 
establishment of two regulating committees (one per standard). 
Their job, in part, will be to ensure the linkage between 
different regions' networks. 
  Among the potential consequences of the competition that has 
just concluded, many specialists mention, first and foremost, a 
sharp intensification of competition among the producers of 
cellular communications equipment.

Boeings Will Appear in Russia by May" 
  [Text] The Russian aviation industry has been forced to 
enter into direct competition with the leading Western aircraft 
manufacturers--yesterday the Aeroflot-Russian International 
Airlines company concluded an agreement with the Boeing 
Corporation and the Irish JPA Leasing Company for the leasing of 
four new Boeing 767-300 ER airliners. The first two airliners 
will arrive this May. The possibility of leasing several more 
Boeings and an Airbus AZ 10-300 is also being considered. 
International Aeroflot, operating under the conditions of a real 
market and tough competition, has been forced to concern itself 
with the effectiveness of its flights, and therefore is choosing 
foreign planes. 
  At a meeting that Dmitriy Barilov, director of 
Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, and Sergey Frantsev, 
deputy acting director of the airline's production and 
commercial department, had yesterday with Carry Pawluk, Boeing's 
regional director for sales in Northern and Eastern Europe, the 
procedures for leasing four Boeing 767-300 ER airliners were 
discussed. Thus, except for a few details, the talks between 
Aeroflot and Boeing on acquiring airliners of that type (see 
KOMMERSANT for 27 January) have been virtually completed. The 
new Boeings will be purchased by the Irish JPA company and then 
leased to Aeroflot for five years. Details of the agreement with 
JPA have not yet been made public, but according to KOMMERSANT's 
information, the cost of leasing will be approximately $300 
million (not counting interest). The Russian side will receive 
first two aircraft this May. 
  As Mr. Frantsev stated, in terms of flight range, economy 
and 
number of passengers, Aeroflot's basic intercontinental plane, 
the Il-62M, is inferior to the Boeing 767-300 ER (see table). At 
the same time, operation of the new Russian Il-96-300 airliner 
is too costly. The five Airbus A310-300s in Aeroflot's 
possession are best suited to transcontinental flights. That is 
what led to the decision to lease the Boeing 767-300 ERs, which 
have been flown by the leading foreign airlines since 1989. 
  As KOMMERSANT has learned, Kazakhstan's international 
airlines will soon follow International Aeroflot's example. And 
Aeroflot is presently considering the possibility of leasing 
another group of Boeings (most likely it will be Boeing 
747-400s, the process of whose certification in Russia, as 
KOMMERSANT reported on 1 February, is already under way) and 
AZ10-300s. Aeroflot's decision is distressing news for the 
Russian aviation industry--for all practical purposes, it means 
the beginning of direct competition with the leading foreign 
aircraft manufacturers in our own domestic market. The new 
Il-96-300, Il-114 and Tu-204 airliners have not yet been brought 
up to the required level of economy and flight readiness. 
Moreover, Russian and CIS airlines flying domestic routes do not

the other hand, the airlines flying international routes are 
operating under the real conditions of stiff competition in the 
world air transportation market, which is what led to the choice 
of the most economical foreign-made airliners.

"Trump Card: American-Chinese Relations on the Geopolitical 
Scales"] 
  [Text] Great revolutions usually attract attention by their 
social, domestic, and international repercussions. Yet such 
cataclysms change fundamentally not only the social but also the 
geopolitical picture of the world. The Chinese people's 
revolution is undoubtedly such. It led the Chinese people onto 
the path of socialist building and in less than half a century 
of complex, zigzag-like development raised China, this 
semicolonial country in the recent past, to the level of 
structure-forming value of the modern world order. 
  The victory of the revolution caused a fundamental change in 
China's international position. In line with the strengthening 
of popular-democratic statehood and the successes in economic 
building, China's importance in world politics grew. But decades 
passed before, in our time, on the frontier of the 21st century, 
the geopolitical potential of the Chinese revolution began to 
manifest itself comprehensively and in full. For this to happen 
it took transition to a qualitatively different level of the 
basic indicators of domestic, primarily economic, development. 
There was, in addition, a regrouping of international forces 
which brought about the need for a restoration of the 
geopolitical balance upset by the breakdown of the coalition of 
socialist countries, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and 
the present Russian administration's abandonment of the mission 
of maintenance of the geopolitical balance, strategic stability, 
and general peace bequeathed it by history. 
  As a result, irrespective of how Beijing sees the country's 
future international role, socialist China, by virtue of its 
geopolitical size, military power (availability of a deterrent 
nuclear arsenal), political status (permanent membership of the 
UN Security Council), and social attractiveness for a large 
group of countries, is already changing from the status of 
regional power to a center of power of a global order and a 
factor of deterrence and geopolitical balance, replacing in this 
sense the former Soviet Union, and now also Russia, which is 
incapable as yet of occupying the place of a structure-forming 
value in the world geopolitical equation. The aspiration to 
balance is a law of international (geopolitical) interaction, it 
would seem. It may be recognized by a state or states and then 
becomes, as has been the case repeatedly in the history of 
international relations, the basis of a particular type of 
policy. But even when this does not occur, a trend toward 
balance is inevitably manifested, irrespective of the political 
wishes of this subject of the international process or the 
other, so that it might at any moment become a political 
reality. There are signs that it is China that could perform an 
appreciable role in the process of the formation of a new 
strategic balance and geopolitical stability and in the creation 
of that new system of international relations that will 
inevitably emerge from the present chaos. 
  This prospect seems quite certain. How China's socioeconomic 
and political system might evolve in our time is another matter. 
It is hard also to foresee of what significance China will be 
for Russia in its new geopolitical capacity. But this will 
depend to a large extent on Russia. 
  A substantial part of our country to the east of Baykal 
belongs to the Pacific geopolitical theater. The prospects of 
the development of this part of Russia will depend to an 
appreciable extent on its economic integration in the 
Asia-Pacific economic space which is taking shape, in its 
northeast subregion particularly. In connection with the loss of 
important ports in the seas of the Atlantic there is growing 
significance for Russia as a whole in the maritime areas of the 
Far East with convenient harbors ensuring an entry to the 
Pacific. There is every reason to suppose that Russian strategy 
will in time have to be paying the main attention to the 
Asia-Pacific direction, if, of course, Russia is destined to 
develop in accordance with its position of world power linking 
by the continental Eurasian spaces the Atlantic with the 
Pacific, Europe with Asia, and West with East. 
  Nor can we close our eyes to the fact that in Moscow's 
natural, traditional geopolitical movement eastward present-day 
Russia is encountering resistance on the part of maritime 
Pacific powers--the United States and Japan--which are by no 
means interested in the appearance in the Pacific of a new 
strategic value or simply a competitor even. 
  Under these conditions the significance of China and 
good-neighbor relations with it for the future of Russia should 
not evoke the least doubts. Land borders extending for thousands 
of kilometers separate densely populated and industrially 
developed areas of China from desert and backward areas of 
Russia. A population of more than 1 billion seeking points of 
contact for its forces, a dynamic, enterprising, and relatively 
stable state which is prepared to defend its values and which 
possesses all the necessary instruments for this--it is with 
such a China that Russia will have to deal under the conditions 
of the inevitable loss of illusions apropos the West and the 
highly ponderable probability of the development of rivalry with 
the United States. 
  Yet the approach of Russia, meaning the present political 
leadership, is oriented, as it were, toward a complication of 
Russian-Chinese relations for many years to come. It is 
sufficient to say that the "Concept of Foreign Policy of the 
Russian Federation" recommends that we build relations with 
China with consideration of "the differences in ideology and 
social and political systems." This same document, on the same 
page, outlines the prospect of "strategic partnership" with the 
United States in the Asia-Pacific region based on a "commitment 
to common democratic values." 
  Corresponding to these aims is foreign policy practice: The 
search for pragmatic advantages and the deals that are being 
concluded conceal only somewhat the malevolent approach, colored 
with ideological intolerance, of the Russian regime to relations 
with a most important state occupying a key position in the 
Asia-Pacific region and moving toward the level of global 
geopolitical interaction. 
  It would seem that the possibility of the appearance of a 
new 
geopolitical rival of such a scale is beginning to trouble the 
United States also. This is manifested, specifically, in 
American foreign policy assertiveness in the new states on 
China's periphery. Washington, clearly disturbed by China's 
growing strategic importance, is seeking geopolitical levers for 
containing Chinese communism. It is hoped to entrust the brunt 
of this task to Russia, evidently. Washington's confidence that 
Russia's radical democrats will further America's plans to 
loosen the socialist system in China and direct this country's 
development in accordance with the East European or Russian 
model is easily divined here. If these plans fail, Russia, which 
borders China, would have to draw onto itself the main Chinese 
forces and, in the event of a conflict, involve its soldiers in 
a war for others' interests. The United States itself here, 
separated from the Asian continent by ocean expanses, where it 
has, in addition, decisive superiority in naval forces, would 
remain aloof from the bloodshed. 
  An analogy suggests itself: At the start of the 1970's also 
the American side attempted to gain superiority to the Soviet 
Union by playing the "China card." In just the same way in our 
time Russia has been assigned the role of trump card in the 
geopolitical game upon which Washington has embarked for the 
purpose of depriving China of the fruits of the socialist 
revolution, which has converted this once backward country into 
an international factor of world significance.

"Explosion in Sarayevo Was Provocation by Muslim Extremists" 
  [Text] The mortar round that hit the market in Sarajevo on 
5 February was launched from Muslim rather than Serbian 
positions. That was reported by the TANJUG agency, citing 
members of the U.N. forces' command who asked to remain unnamed. 
Information about this is contained in a report by an expert 
commission that has already been sent to U.N. headquarters in 
New York. 
  The commission established that the shelling that resulted 
in 
68 deaths and left about 200 wounded was carried out from the 
positions of the Muslim Army's Second Mountain Brigade--from a 
spot located approximately 1-1.5 km from the boundary line 
separating it from Serbian forces. Muhamed Secirbegovic, 
permanent representative to the United Nations of the Muslim 
government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acknowledged the fact of 
the receipt of the commission's report at U.N. headquarters. 
  In the opinion of Yugoslav military experts, such a powerful 
impact could not have resulted from the explosion of a single 
mortar shell, even a large-caliber one. What is most likely, 
they believe, is that a powerful explosive device packed with 
shrapnel was activated in the market simultaneously with the 
mortar explosion. They report that a powerful radial-action 
antipersonnel fragmentation mine capable of striking everything 
within a radius of 60 to 80 meters was developed at a military 
plant in Bugojno that is in the hands of the Muslims. The 
POLITIKA EKSPRESS newspaper has also reported the name of the 
person who organized the clandestine action--a certain Mirza 
Khadzijamakovic, who back before the war underwent training as 
an explosives expert in the former Yugoslavia's Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. Obviously, a provocation on such a scale could 
not have been carried out without the knowledge of the 
highest-ranking Sarajevo leaders. 
  Of course, the fact of the Muslim authorities' blame for the 
tragedy in the Sarajevo market does not mean that the siege of 
Sarajevo should not be lifted. However, the persistence with 
which NATO is insisting on bombing precisely the Serbian 
positions raises questions concerning that organization's 
objectivity with regard to a Yugoslav settlement. 
  In the past, one-sided threats against the Serbs under the 
pretext that Bosnia "is a victim of aggression" have resulted 
only in inflaming the conflict. Even British Defense Minister 
Malcolm Rifkind was forced to admit in a recent interview on 
London television that "the United Nations' presence has 
unquestionably prolonged the war." Thus, if the North Atlantic 
alliance, in seeking a more active role in Bosnia, really wants 
a prompt end to the civil war, Brussels should take the United 
Nations' mistakes into account. If an ultimatum is to be 
presented, it should be presented to all three warring sides, 
and not to the Serbs alone. Yet Washington's proposal to demand 
that the Bosnian Serbs withdraw their artillery and tanks from 
Sarajevo under the threat of air strikes suffers from 
one-sidedness. Such an approach will probably be interpreted by 
the other side in the conflict as covert support.

<F P=106> [Article by Staff Correspondent V. Matrosov: "Velvet </F>
Occupation?"] 
  [Text] During the last 10 days of January armadas of 
Japanese fishing schooners, one after another, ostentatiously 
intruded into Russian territorial waters off the Southern 
Kurils. Our marine border guards have been attempting to repel 
the violators and demanding that they head for home, but to no 
avail. The only thing left for the border guards to do is to 
curse to themselves. And to hear, in response, curses and even 
threats. The Japanese have a lot of fast schooners, and we have 
relatively few patrol boats. The mass onslaught of Japanese 
fishermen and crabbers took place under the perfectly official 
observation of three vessels of the Japanese maritime 
administration. 
  As we have learned, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
of course, made a representation to the Japanese Embassy 
concerning the "brazen conduct toward the Russian boarder 
guards," but it received a rebuff: the Japanese government 
cannot recognize the lawfulness of calling the commanders of 
those fishing ships border violators. 
  The fishermen of the Land of the Rising Son have let 
themselves go completely: what sort of border can there be, they 
say, when the Southern Kurils and their adjoining waters belong 
to Japan! It matters little what the Russians think. And 
therefore the Japanese are robbing our sea larders on an 
ever-growing scale. The shores of the islands have been enmeshed 
in several layers of sunken nets, which causes tremendous damage 
to natural life and creates hazards for shipping. Sometimes the 
border guards fire warning shots at the poachers and even detain 
the schooners, but the Japanese side takes that as a challenge. 
When five Japanese captains were put on trial in Shikotan as 
border violators in early December, 44 fishing boats 
ostentatiously set out to poach. Some of them sailed so close to 
the shores that one could hear both their music and their 
cursing. 
  If this sort of thing continues any longer, the Kurils' 
residents say, we won't be surprised if the Japanese, some time 
at their convenience, land on our islands and, under the cover 
of their police, raise their state flag over our municipal 
offices in place of the Russian flag.

"Not Departing From the Main Thing: A New Wave of Activation of 
Russian-German Relations"] 
  [Text] The end of January and the beginning of February 
were marked by a resumption of the German-Japanese dialogue, 
which had been interrupted after President Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to Japan last year. The reasons for this were the elections to 
the Federal Assembly and the reorganization of the government in 
Russia. The Japanese noted with satisfaction the fact that 
Andrey Kozyrev would continue to be in charge of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Russia. At the same time the resolution of 
the recent government crisis in Japan, which ended with a 
compromise between the ruling coalition and the opposition of 
liberal democrats, is of no small importance to the Russian side. 
  Trilateral talks were held in Tokyo among Russia, Japan, and 
the United States on problems of regional security in Northeast 
Asia. Then there were Russian-Japanese talks on problems of 
foreign policy and defense. Problems that are extremely 
sensitive for Russia and Japan were discussed there. It is well 
known that there are still many Russians who, under the 
influence of propaganda of the recent past, believe in the 
"aggressiveness of the Japanese-American military alliance" and 
regard Japan as Germany's ally in World War II. Articles 
referring to the British newspaper THE SUNDAY TIMES concerning 
Japan's readiness to create its own nuclear weapon will 
contribute considerably to the negative attitude toward Japan. 
And they say nothing about this same readiness on the part of 
the DPRK, which is incomparably weaker than Japan in terms of 
its scientific, technical, and financial potential, or of the 
fact that Japan's capabilities of creating a nuclear weapon and 
its components have never been denied by anyone. The question 
can be reduced to the political will of the Japanese ruling 
circles, and it does not seem to exist. While the South Korean 
leaders seem to have plenty of political will. 
  On the other hand, people in Japan are concerned about 
Zhirinovskiy's success and his threats to "arrange for another 
Hiroshima" and they are trying to understand how serious all 
this is. Statements about the territorial problem in the old 
style made by the head of the Russian Government Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and the chairman of the Council of the Federation 
Vladimir Shumeyko, of course, have not gone unnoticed by 
Japanese public opinion either. And Shumeyko's words to the 
effect that the position of the Russian Government on the 
territorial question diverges from Russia's official position 
sounded strange to citizens of the Russian Federation, not to 
mention how mysterious they must have seemed to Japanese. 
  All this could not have failed to have had an effect on the 
meetings in Tokyo. Judging from reports from the Japanese 
capital, the arrival of the eminent deputy of the State Duma and 
one of the leaders of Russia's Choice, Gennadiy Burbulis, could 
not clarify the overall picture. The Japanese have an extremely 
favorable attitude toward Burbulis, and therefore he was 
received by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Tsutomu Hata. It is noteworthy that Kozyrev's 
wish, conveyed by Burbulis, to conduct regular meetings of the 
two ministers, Hata, on the one hand, expressed his intention to 
visit Russia and, on the other, made his visit conditional on 
satisfactory results of Russian-Japanese talks which had been 
postponed by the Russian side under the pretext of 
unpreparedness and are now scheduled for the end of February. 
  One should keep in mind that the talks are to be conducted 
within the framework of the bilateral work group on the peace 
treaty. But the problem of the Russian-Japanese peace treaty 
amounts essentially to the same territorial problem. Although 
Moscow concludes various kinds of agreements with Tokyo--like 
all 17 joint plans for environmental protection--and they 
jointly discuss questions of politics and security, this does 
not determine the overall picture of the condition of our 
bilateral relations. Different facts are more important to the 
Japanese side: the use of weapons by Russian border guards 
against Japanese fishermen fishing in the region that the 
Japanese consider theirs; appeals from the head of the 
administration of the South Kuril region "to take a strict 
position of power regarding the problem of illegal fishing by 
Japanese fishing boats in Russian territorial waters"; arrests 
of Japanese fishermen and their trials; maintenance of a 
powerful Russian military presence in the Kuril Islands; and 
everything else in this spirit. 
  The territorial problem cannot be avoided, and to consider 
it 
"resolved once and for all in 1945" will be for Russia an error 
with more serious consequences than all this was for the Soviet 
Union: The Russian Federation will undermine its already weak 
positions in the Asia-Pacific Region, ending up on the sidelines 
of the process of the development of regional cooperation, not 
to mention the prospects of relations between Russia and Japan.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin under the rubric "Smolensk </F>
Square": "Russian Germans: Moscow Asks Bonn Not To Get Upset: 
And Advocates a Stage-by-Stage Solution to the Problem"] 
  [Text] The problem of ethnic Germans on the territory of 
the Russian Federation is becoming one of the most important 
aspects of Russian-German relations. For official Bonn this 
issue is a unique indicator which determines the degree of our 
interaction. Moscow has an understanding attitude toward the 
position of the FRG leaders since a large proportion of the 2 
million population of Germans of the former USSR are living in 
Russia. 
  This is why the new democratic Russia has taken a number of 
steps to rectify the mistakes of the past. The Edict of the 
President of Russia "On Immediate Measures for Rehabilitation of 
Russian Germans," was adopted in February 1992. The Protocol on 
Cooperation Between the Governments of Russia and the FRG took 
effect in March 1993 with the objective of stage-by-stage 
restoration of the state affiliation of Russian Germans. This 
situation was also registered in a joint statement from 
President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl of 21 November 1991. The implementation of practical 
measures in this area, including preservation of cultural 
uniqueness and vital rights of the aforementioned category of 
citizens are being handled by the intergovernmental commission 
of the Russian Federation and the FRG on problems of Russian 
Germans. Four meetings have already been held in a businesslike 
and constructive atmosphere. 
  Bonn is scrupulously and promptly fulfilling the commitments 
it has made in keeping with the agreements. Last year the FRG 
Government allotted more than 120 million marks for improving 
living conditions for Russian Germans in densely populated 
areas. So far only 70 million marks has actually been spent. 
Programs for the development of education, culture, and study of 
the German language are being actively supported. 
  At the same time Germany has been reproaching Moscow more 
and 
more recently for the fact that it is not keeping its own 
promises for creating a Republic of Germans of the Volga Area 
and building up national regions for Russian Germans. It would 
seem that the time for this was not chosen randomly. In March 
there will be another meeting of the Intergovernmental 
Commission of the Russian Federation and the FRG on Ethnic 
Germans. Is this not an attempt to exert pressure on the 
partners and thus force the process? 
  As far as we know, official circles of the FRG up to this 
point have accepted in a positive spirit Moscow's initiatives 
for solving problems of Russian Germans. And in principle a good 
deal has been done here. The Intergovernmental Commission has 
coordinated about 60 joint projects for economic and cultural 
development. Some 5.4 billion rubles [R] has been received from 
the state budget for these purposes, including for the needs of 
culture and education. Considerable funds have also been 
allotted by the Russian regions. A large share of the projects 
are being implemented with assistance from the Ministry of 
Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy of Russia in German 
regions of Omsk Oblast, Altay Kray, and the Volga area. The 
administration of St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast and the 
government of the Land of Baden-Wuerttenberg have approved the 
project for creating farmer settlements of Russian Germans in 
the village of Nazie in Kirovskiy Rayon in Leningrad Oblast. In 
the first stage 25 of these facilities and 15 handicraft 
enterprises will be constructed. A large-scale project for 
resettlement of Russian Germans in Pskov Oblast is being 
developed with the participation of the Russian side. 
Additionally, there is a directive from the president of the 
Russian Federation to establish a Russian-German university. 
  Because of the efforts that have been made we have managed 
to 
influence to a certain degree the emigration attitudes among 
this part of the Russian population. Thus the number of 
applications to go to Germany submitted from ethnic Germans from 
the republics of the former USSR in 1993 (according to German 
figures) has decreased by 150,000 as compared to 1992. Last year 
about 200,000 Germans left for Germany from Russia and the CIS 
countries and another 200,000 have exit documents in their hands 
but have not yet used them. For the FRG the retardation of the 
rates of repatriation of compatriots should signify a 
considerable plus on the economic plane. 
  Of course, the reproaches against the Russian side heard in 
the mass media in the FRG are sometimes not unfounded. Things 
are not moving as rapidly as they would like. And the main 
reason is our economic difficulties. They make it impossible for 
Russian authorities to begin to implement the earmarked projects 
in full measure. Last year we failed to allot our 5.4 billion 
from the budget for improving living conditions for Russian 
Germans. And German representatives working directly in the 
regions where ethnic Germans live are well aware of this. The 
Russian mass media are always writing about this as well. So is 
there any point in inflaming passions any more? It would seem 
that a position of calm and complete mutual understanding 
regarding this issue would make it possible to resolve in stages 
the problem of creating a German autonomous entity and improving 
living conditions in national regions for Russian Germans.

<F P=106> Article by I. Loboda, member of the CPSU since 1942: "People </F>
View Him as a Leader: A Few Words About Kim Chong-il"] 
  [Text] A great deal of information is published all 
over the world these days about Kim Chong-il. Certain circles do 
not stint on throwing a dark cloud over him and attributing to 
him characteristics that do not evoke anything likeable. 
  Who is he really, this person who has been placed in 
the highest positions in the Republic by the Korean Labor Party? 
Why do real communists look at him with hope and favor, and 
renegades with fear and loathing? 
  Enemies of socialism are frightened because Kim Chong-il, a 
strong person with principles, embodies socialist strivings and 
the decisiveness of the Korean people, and he is a true son of 
the Korean people. They are frightened that every practical 
activity and theoretical work by Kim Chong-il expresses 
socialist ideas and the greatest strength of the Korean nation. 
His image has imbedded itself deeply into the consciousness of 
Koreans and has become as beloved to them as the image of his 
father. 
  Foes are scared because in less than half a century the 
country, led by Kim Il-song, and in the last decades by Kim 
Chong-il, has become a reliable stronghold of socialism on our 
planet. The invincible socialist system in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], a party that is true to 
communism, powerful armed forces, an impressive economy, and 
nationwide popular support of its leaders and a deep and sincere 
respect for them, have all become obvious facts. 
  We see in the DPRK a new form of socialist organization for 
society and a country that has found its own road to socialism. 
Imperialists and their accomplices--renegades of every sort--are 
afraid of socialist Korea's influence on millions of people of 
this Earth. 
  Together with Kim Chong-il, a new generation is taking over 
the leadership of the party and the country. Kim Chong-il has 
devoted a great deal of effort in bringing up and educating this 
generation. This generation has a passion for action and a zeal 
for new undertakings. It is against routine, sluggishness, 
inertia, and indecisiveness. The energy and initiative of this 
new generation are blended with the rich experience, knowledge, 
and prudence of its predecessors. 
  History has given Kim Chong-il an enormous role, and at the 
same time a great responsibility, but not just for the future of 
his country. Pyongyang has become the center of unity for the 
world's socialist forces. The Pyongyang Declaration, which has 
already been accepted by over 200 political parties of the 
world, is having an ever greater influence over mankind. 
Everyone who has eyes can see how the forces of socialism are 
getting over the shock caused by the treachery of renegades, and 
how these socialist forces are growing in strength. Socialism 
now does not simply exist, but is fighting and winning. 
  All this explains the increased interest in Kim Chong-il. 
Neither blockades nor outright bans can hide the truth about 
this leader and his written works. Every honest person sees the 
image of a man for whom the happiness and well-being of his 
people are more important than anything else in the world. 
  From a very early age he devoted his life entirely to the 
cause of the revolution. In the quarter of a century since he 
finished his university studies, he has gone through all the 
stages of party organizational work and executive duties. He had 
started as a rank-and-file instructor in one of the departments 
of the Central Committee of the WPK [Workers' Party of Korea]. 
During these years he acquired a great deal of political 
experience. His family environment also facilitated his gaining 
this experience. 
  Kim Chong-il did not become simply a successor to his 
father, 
Kim Il-song, but the continuator of his father's 
deeds. He kept up the creative development of communist theory 
in accordance with the new conditions that came about as a 
result of changes in society and society's scientific 
achievements, including the achievements of the Korean people, 
who belong to one of the oldest civilizations. This is why it is 
unthinkable to separate Kim Il-songism, as a science, from its 
continuator, Kim Chong-il. 
  From the very beginning, Kim Chong-il attached great 
significance to moral education and to transforming all of 
society on the basis of the ideas of chuche. This was timely, 
not only because new tasks were arising in the process of 
building socialism. World imperialism was increasing its 
subversive work against the DPRK. In addition, it was necessary 
to make fundamental assessments of the activities of the 
renegades in the worldwide communist movement and to mercilessly 
expose the roots of this most harmful phenomenon. 
  Efforts made in political-educational work, and the 
consolidation of a united ideological system in the party and 
among the people brought tangible results. Communist 
consciousness was raised and the productive initiative of the 
workers increased. 
  Kim Chong-il has devoted many works to problems of ideology 
and the leading role of the WPK in ideology. It can be said 
about these works and their contents that they constitute a 
powerful attack against all forces of reaction, no matter under 
what false colors they are hiding. The correctness of the 
assessments and prognoses in these works has been confirmed by 
the entire course of development of both the DPRK and other 
countries. 
  As a writer, I understand and embrace Kim Chong-il's 
contribution of every art form to leadership. It is difficult to 
even enumerate all his important theses presented during 
meetings with employees of motion pictures, writers, musicians, 
and artists. Kim Chong-il comprehensively enlightened the roles 
of these people and the intelligentsia in general in the 
building of socialism. He charted an original course for 
completing a radical revolution that guaranteed the present 
flowering of artistry in motion pictures, literature, the stage, 
and concert halls. In Kim Chong-il's pronouncements, especially 
those given to motion picture employees, the following theses 
can be noted: Art should not fear an exaggeration of the good, 
so that this good can become even better. Also, art should not 
fear an exaggeration of a bad, depraved person, so that this 
exaggeration can evoke repulsion and ignite a striving to 
eliminate everything hateful and shameful. 
  Readers of Kim Chong-il's works are favorably impressed by 
the author's deep belief that by virtue of the objective laws of 
historical development, socialism cannot be destroyed by any 
alliances or blocs between renegades and imperialists. Day 
always triumphs over night. Kim Chong-il is convinced that 
gigantic forces are concealed within socialism, and that 
socialism is capable of creating the most just society about 
which the best minds of man have always dreamed. 
  Kim Chong-il's works also clearly demonstrate comprehensive 
understanding that in given circumstances certain things for 
which there is enough strength can be done and should be done. 
The leader of the Korean people has proclaimed himself 
uncompromising, he will not make concessions concerning 
principles and problems on which the fate of the nation and the 
success of socialism depend. It is not in his character to turn 
down plans that had been approved, no matter how difficult they 
may be. Kim Chong-il is convinced that every person, even one 
who believes himself to be weak, has hidden strength and 
potential. In order to bring them out, it is necessary for a 
person to understand that he has them, and it is necessary to 
motivate him with the all-conquering ideas of 
chuche. Kim Chong-il is characterized by the strength of his 
mind and his penetrating knowledge that allows him to quickly 
and faultlessly analyze events, tell the difference between 
people, and to assess everyone and use everyone in accordance 
with his abilities. He openly talks about shortcomings and 
errors, being convinced that the right way does not need to hide 
anything and does not need to distort facts. 
  And there is something else: Kim Chong-il expresses his 
thoughts in speaking and writing always in the most precise, 
direct, clear, and short form. His analyses are penetrating. His 
conclusions are based on facts. He expresses his thoughts 
simply, convincingly, and spiritedly. This is because Kim 
Chong-il frequently mixes with people from very different 
professions, acquiring from them the habit for this style. 
  Notwithstanding his immense popularity among his people and 
the respect given him in the DPRK, he has remained a modest and 
unpretentious man, fierce and implacable towards his foes, but 
touchingly attentive to his comrades and to working people. Kim 
Chong-il presents identical moral criteria to himself and to the 
rank-and-file. He believes that there should be no privileges or 
exceptions for anyone with regard to morality. 
  Kim Chong-il's theory and practice, based on the great ideas 
of chuche, are highly valued and approved by the world communist 
movement. He is seen as a true communist leader who is firm and 
independent, and who can resolve the most revolutionary problems 
out of all the problems that now face the revolutionaries of the 
world. Kim Chong-il is the hope not only of Koreans, but all 
other progressive peoples of this Earth.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Kakimkhan Quttybayev, senior </F>
officer of the Republic of Kazakhstan Internal Military Press 
Center: "The Many Hopes of Kazakhs Living in China."] 
  [Text] Since the independence of our country we have 
achieved many things. One of them is that [some of] our kindred, 
living in foreign countries, have returned home. We have also 
opened paths of communications and relationships with some 
[others]. Due to such possibilities, I returned to the Ile 
Kazakh Autonomous Oblast in the Chinese People's Republic. In 
fact, seeing with my own eyes was better than hearing about 
things there. In order to make known to people what came to mind 
there, I have written this article. I acquainted myself somewhat 
with the living conditions of our kinsmen in a neighboring 
country. Most were involved with individual enterprise. One 
receives gain according to how one works. The results are in 
one's own hands. They are dependent upon one another. There is 
no disorder. They began to move along that favorable road at the 
end of the 1970s. It is no secret that up until that time they 
witnessed unheard of things and suffered repeated difficulties, 
and we witnessed how they, exhausted, took weak steps towards a 
new life. Most of the marks of great suffering are still not 
wiped from their hearts. 
  However, the Kazakh people who have survived all that and 
have left their suffering behind them, are not bad off today. 
There are sufficient numbers of rich Kazakhs raising large herds 
of horses and other fat livestock. Each person does the best 
they can. There are no limits to livestock raising and each 
raises as many as he can. The amount of land available for use 
decreases with each passing year. By law each person is to 
receive 2 mu of land. How is the term mu to be understood? I 
asked. In your terms there are 16 mu to a hectare. Thus eight 
persons must be fed from the products of a hectare of land. That 
is very little land. 
  We are not made to suffer difficulty. Products of animal 
husbandry are numerous. We have our summer pastures and our 
winter pastures. They are unsuited for growing grain; they are 
mountain defiles and sloping areas. However, they are 
exceptional places for raising livestock. There are many places 
where the richest, most nourishing grass is abundant, thus, 
answered Qudaybergen Sarsenbayuly, a thirty-three-year-old 
relative of mine serving as a leader. Qudaybergen, after a 
pause, contined: if one sows seed in the proper time in the new 
lands and takes care of the crop, it will be completely adequate 
for no one even if harvested without loss. If one is inattentive 
and lazy, you will not have enough food no matter what, and you 
will be dependent on someone else. 
  ...The dazzling crops around us waved like the ocean. The 
grains of wheat growing without weeds excited us involuntarily. 
Economical use and respect for the land had become a good 
tradition. At the time of the spring sowing and during the 
autumn harvest they are incomparable. However, they provide 
nothing whatever during the rest of the time. The festivals and 
the visiting go on during those times. 
  During the years you see the good and the bad as a leading 
official (equivalent to the combined jobs of sovkhoz director 
and of a party organization secretary). What do you think of the 
current way of life? I asked again. 
  Indeed, when I came on the scene it was a time of want and 
of 
poverty. The difficulty was not just mine, the entire people 
were suffering. Alas, our Kazakhs were in a sorry state! We were 
suffering completely intolerable difficulties. God willing, now 
the character of life has changed and things are easy for the 
people. 
  In front of us there were more than a hundred horses and 
cattle and nearly a thousand smaller livestock. I think that our 
present way of life is good. It is a time when each person 
believes in his own honest labor. No one is trying to cheat or 
intimidate us. I now have nearly 70 horses and cattle, and 
something like 300 smaller livestock. Other than income [tax] 
paid to the government, I have no other loss. However, I was 
unable to get all of my livestock safely through the winter 
without loss. I know what the problem was. There is no one who 
can order me to increase my livestock to a thousand or to 
decrease their numbers. For that reason, I bought 30 head of 
horses and cattle and as many smaller livestock as I needed. One 
sets one's own level of profit. I see my labor solely in terms 
of productivity. Under the old system I herded the government's 
livestock, and for this purpose the government had to provide 
enclosures, hay, and a monthly salary. Transportation was given 
to the officials set over me, and I had to pay them a monthly 
salary. That is all gone today. The government expends no funds 
whatever for me. I myself prepare food for the livestock and 
build enclosures. He paused as if he was thinking about 
something else. 
  Your situation is good. Your children have shoes, you have a 
livelihood. People notice when people are living well. A person 
still has his hopes. What is your hope now? I asked very 
directly. 
  Indeed there is no one without his hopes. One thing, which 
is 
not just my hope but the hope of all Kazakhs, is returning to 
the homeland. If we can face Mecca [to pray] on the soil of our 
ancestors, all our hopes will be fulfilled. Thus saying, he 
stopped abruptly, his eyes filled with tears, and he wept loudly 
before finishing his words. The people, collected at the head of 
the table, went on droning a song mixed with tears as if 
approving of the words of some aqsaqal [Kazakh elder]. The songs 
were beautiful, the words pleasant. They are sufficient 
testimony to the longing for the homeland. The questions coming 
from all directions, the words of cheer pronounced to our 
kinsmen moved us profoundly. One was confused by the number of 
people invited without ceremony into their houses as guests. 
They went and got eighty-six-year-old aqsaqal Nesipbay mentioned 
at one point in the conversation. He was born in Taldyqorghan 
oblast, Sarqant Rayon, the present Energiya Kolkhoz. Calling to 
mind his country and the place where he had grown up, he wept 
loudly. He read a poem of 50 verses dedicated to President 
Nazarbayev and to the independence of our country and set many 
questions in motion. He was in service as an old man, and had 
seen a great deal of life. He was an aqsaqal capable of making 
an impression with words. He listened to some, and others 
listened to him. He said: We are not looking for land. If the 
two countries come to an agreement, we will move on our own and 
will have our own resources to return to our country. The 
education of all of us, old and young, has been his work. Work 
has raised us all. We will not cause the government any 
difficulty. We promise that we will flourish through our own 
labor. All we need is a place with water. Farming and livestock 
raising, those are our traditional occupations. We have no great 
interest in technology. What we believe in is the power of our 
own knowledge, he said, summarizing what was in the minds of 
many. All joined in these words. It had been some time since the 
law limiting childbirth had gone into force in China. Chinese 
women could give birth to one child, Uighur women up to two, 
Kazakh women up to four. The law was one thing. In connection 
with the law, it appeared that reduction in female births among 
the Chinese was leading to uncertain attitudes. Harm to our 
demographic numbers will be observed in the future with the 
implementation of the Internationalist policy. The Muslim people 
in China thought this aspect [of Chinese policy] a great danger. 
Everyone agreed that for a period of 10-15 years there has been 
no pressure or harm whatever inflicted on us. However, the 
future of our children's children will be restricted. Life 
itself has shown them this. During the middle 1960s there was 
little movement in the territory of the Ile Kazakh Autonomous 
Republic, but now the times are different. With each passing 
year the number of people in the interior areas is tilting in 
favor the Chinese, and the land is growing narrow, he said. In 
some areas Muslim graveyards have been completely destroyed and 
large villages build over the top. Thus, all these 
manifestations were greatly disturbing our kinsmen in China. 
  The independence of the Republic was a great joy for them. 
If 
they did not rejoice more than we, they rejoiced no less. All 
those who came brought livestock for slaughtering. They were 
agreeable and wished us happiness. Their hope is that Kazakhstan 
prospers; that the dispersed Kazakhs will be able to return to 
their native land; and that they be allowed to walk in their 
native country. In this connection several words of complaint 
were uttered unintentionally. They said: We are all happy that 
relations between the two countries have been placed on a good 
basis. For some unknown reason it is extremely difficult to 
establish connections with our own country. The Chinese pass 
quickly. They get their documents in good order in no more than 
a month. We, on the other hand, get frozen in the ice, and it 
takes two-three years. And, if we do anything wrong, that is the 
end of it. Thus, our longing for our country becomes grief. Our 
attempts do not go forward. In truth, there are those of our 
countrymen who find their way going back and forth. However, if 
we compare their numbers to those of the Chinese, it is one ear 
of wheat in the barley [a drop in the bucket]. For the Chinese 
it is nothing special if 50-60 million go to Kazakhstan and then 
return. In their [the Chinese Kazakhs] view, there is great 
danger in the growth of Chinese numbers in Kazakhstan, and it 
seems that in three-four years there will be pressure to turn 
Kazakhstan into their [the Chinese] country. They [the Chinese] 
are a people who love to work, who endure hunger, and who do not 
care about where they live or sleep. If we do not stop the flood 
coming to Kazakhstan now, there is no doubt that they will 
overcome us in 10-15 years. Our kinsmen in the Ile Kazakh 
Autonomous Oblast and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Rayon are 
now suffering this. They greatly emphasized one thing. Those who 
come exhausted and hungry recover and begin to get rich in 
one-two years. Leaving other things aside, the broad steppes, 
the rivers, and the lakes would be very convenient for them. The 
wild game and birds, the small animals of the rivers and lakes, 
all the various kinds of plants (weed or not) will be put to use 
by them without distinction. The steppe and the high snowy 
mountains will be ideal for them. For that reason, we must be 
very careful about this. 
  There is nothing wrong with how they speak. They have kept 
the Kazakh language pure. The art of the aytys [poets contest] 
among them is amazing. Courteous young women and men use words 
correctly, and reply to each other with clever expressions. When 
they sing to one another it makes you want to listen and listen. 
The young people never passed directly in front of the old man. 
Whatever the circumstances, the place of honor belongs to the 
old man. The dedication of sisters and daughters-in-law, in 
particular, to the good of the adult males is completely natural. 
  The policy for taking them into the Army is altogether 
different than with us. That is to say, the population is so 
large that only three-four persons among the inhabitants of a 
rayon enter the Army. Thus, there are quite a number competing 
for these positions, and the ones with the most potential are 
accepted. 
  To draw some final conclusions, it is difficult to express 
in 
words the love of our Kazakh kinsmen in the Chinese Peoples 
Republic for Kazakhstan, their pride and faith in the future. 
They rejoice in our achievements and grieve with us in our 
failures. In addition to this, they are a people of genuineness 
and good intentions who place peace above everything. The 
primary hope is to return to their homeland. Ready to use every 
opportunity, thinking that their hopes are near fulfillment, 
they comfort one another as they send me on my way. May your 
hopes be fulfilled, I said returning home.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Niksdorf, parliament secretary of SLOVO </F>
KYRGYZSTANA: "At a Session of the Zhogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz 
Republic the Government Was Confirmed. Two Vacancies Remain"] 
  [Text] The main event of the session's work yesterday 
turned out to be the confirmation of the composition of the 
Government. But this came at the end of yesterday's session. And 
beginning in the morning the usual lawmaking work took place. 
  After the war, when the soccer players of the Moscow 
"Dynamo" 
team completed a triumphal tour of Great Britain, the operetta 
"The Eleven Unknown", the libretto for which was created on the 
basis of motifs from this trip, enjoyed great success. I was 
reminded of the already forgotten operetta yesterday morning 
when the speaker, M. Sherimkulov, remarked jokingly that all the 
same the list of the "unknown" 11 parliamentarians, who do not 
want to receive their hard-earned "deputy allowances," should be 
made public. 
  Yes, however strange, but there turned out to be people in 
the Zhogorku Kenesh, who voted against raising the salary of 
deputies. That question was not on the agenda, but here the 
parliamentarians turned out to be insistent and yesterday began 
precisely with it. Now the people's deputies, by way of 
compensation for expenses connected with deputy activity, will 
receive a sum in the amount of l.5 times the minimum wage every 
month. It was proposed to carry out the recalculation beginning 
of December 1993. However, here, too, the deputies insisted that 
they be paid "on the new plan" retroactive to June. In general, 
decrees with a retroactive date are not adopted, but here a 
vitally important problem was discerned. 
  The speaker put the question to a vote. The indicator board 
illuminated the numbers: 265--"for", 11--"against", 
1--abstained. It was precisely then that M. Sherimkulov 
permitted himself the joking remark. 
  Not without reason do they say: Charity begins at home. Not 
for a single proposal did our deputies vote so unanimously as 
for this. 
  And then, when they continued the discussion of a draft law 
on the election of deputies, interest in voting fell among 
many--somewhere between 230 and 235 deputies took part in it. 
  Perhaps not all should be paid at 1.5 times the wage, but 
only the most active ones? But then we get the obvious 
egalitarianism, which is quite in the spirit of the laws of the 
time of stagnation. Meanwhile some orators have complained that 
many of their colleagues almost do not appear at evening 
sessions. Precisely for this reason it is impossible to adopt a 
number of important decisions. Now I understood why the deputies 
put the question of their own wages in first place on Friday. 
  Yesterday the deputies, of course, impatiently awaited the 
question of the composition of the Government. But, first of 
all, they included on the agenda another question--about its 
structure. Why, as is well known, a new broom sweeps in a new 
way, and Premier A. Dzhumagulov, speaking on behalf of the 
President, told about the innovations. 
  The most important ones: The Ministry of Economics and 
Finance [Minekonomfinans] is being divided once again into the 
Ministry of Finance and the State Committee for Economics. The 
Ministry of Finance will now include the tax and customs 
inspectorates, as well as the State Agency for Securities. This 
will make it possible to concentrate monetary policy in the same 
hands and to improve matters with budget fund receipts. 
  The State Committee for Economics will be engaged in 
analysis 
and forecasting, moreover not only long-term, but also 
short-term. Its functions will also include tasks of the 
structural reorganization of the economy, as well as problems of 
prices and anti-monopoly policy. Speaking about today's Ministry 
of Economics and Finance, the prime minister remarked bitterly: 
"We lost in it essentially the second half--economics." 
  The government, A. Dzhumagulov continued, must provide 
enormous support to small and medium-sized business and attract 
entrepreneurs to the priority programs. It is necessary also to 
bring together into one tight knot the questions of the 
production and sale of products. For this reason, the new 
structure combines into one two present-day 
ministries--industry, as well as trade and material resources. 
The Ministry of Power Engineering is being abolished, and the 
oil, coal, and gas industries will be included in a single 
Ministry of Industry. 
  A Ministry of Agriculture and Food is being created. Its new 
tasks are evident already from the very name. The main thing is 
not only to increase agricultural crops and to develop animal 
husbandry, but also to put products on the table for people. 
  A number of government organizations are increasing their 
status. The State Agency for Statistics, as in the good old 
times, will be the State Committee for Statistics, but will 
operate already in a new way. The State Inspectorate for 
Architecture and Technical Control of Construction has also been 
transformed into the State Committee [for Architecture and 
Technical Control of Construction] and will carry out 
coordination work in the sphere of construction, as well as a 
unified town-planning policy. The State Committee for Defense 
Affairs has been transformed into the Ministry of Defense. Some 
departments, inluding the aviation department, are being brought 
into the Ministry of Transportation. Those are the main changes. 
  As the prime minister said, in the near future 16-20 percent 
of the administrative personnel will have to be cut. 
  Then the prime minister answered numerous questions from the 
deputies. They came forward also with a proposal concerning the 
structure of the Government. However, through the electronic 
voting procedure the President's proposals were approved. 
  During the declared hour-long intermission of the plenary 
session, the permanent commissions of the parliament discussed 
the proposed candidates for members of the government. But the 
intermission dragged out for another hour. Only at 18:10 did A. 
Dzhumagulov step up to the rostrum, who one by one gave the 
names of the members of the Government, and the people's 
deputies expressed their attitude to the proposed candidates 
through their vote. 
  The following were approved by the Parliament: 
  A. MATUBRAIMOV -- first vice-premier of the Government. 
  O. IBRAIMOV -- vice-premier. 
  Dzh. AMANBAYEV -- vice-premier. 
  A. IORDAN -- vice-premier and minister of industry, material 
resources and trade. 
  E. OMURALIYEV -- vice-premier and chairman of the State 
Property Fund. 
  Ya. FISHER -- vice-premier, chairman of the State Commission 
for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense. 
  Confirmed as ministers: finance -- K. SHAKIROV; internal 
affairs -- A. SUTALINOV; transportation -- S. ABLESOV; education 
-- A. KAKEYEV; water management -- M. ZULPUYEV; health care -- 
N. KASIYEV; communications --E. BEKTENOV; labor and social 
questions -- Z. KHAKIMOV; justice -- M. CHOLPONBAYEV; defense -- 
M. SUBANOV; culture -- Ch. BAZARBAYEV. 
  Confirmed as chairmen of state committees: for economics -- 
A. MURALIYEV; architecture and construction -- I. KADYRBEKOV; 
geology --Sh. TEKENOV; national security -- A. BAKAYEV; 
environmental protection -- I. MURATALIN; training of skilled 
workers and entrepreneurs -- I. KASENDEYEV; physical culture and 
sport --K. OSMONALIYEV; science and new technology -- K. 
ZHUMALIYEV; tourism - A. MOISEYEV; statistics --Dzh. AKINEYEV. 
  E. Karabayev, who was proposed for the post of ministers of 
foreign affairs, did not get the necessary number of votes. The 
permanent commission of the parliament also did not agree with 
the candidacy of B. TALGARBEKOV for the post of minister of 
agriculture and food, and the speaker did not start the call for 
a vote "in order not to traumatize the individual." It seems, he 
acted, as always, wisely -- to act in the heat of the moment is 
not worth it, and tomorrow it may be possible to come to a 
general agreement. 
  A. Sharshenaliyev was confirmed as procurator general of the 
Kyrgyz Republic. 
  In closing the session, M. Sherimkulov emphasized that the 
parliament will work amicably with the new membership of the 
Government. One may be so bold as to say, he declared, that no 
black cat will cross our path. 
  Today the session is continuing its work.

  As is well known, the Zhogorku Kenesh did not give its 
assent 
to the President for the appointment of E. Karabayev as minister 
of foreign affairs in the new composition of the Government. 
However, for the time being A. Akayev has not made an official 
decision.

How Much Does Gas Cost?"] 
  [Text] President Islam Karimov of 
Uzbekistan received an award from the Kyrgyz "Rukhaniyat" 
(Spirituality) Association in a ceremony in the Kyrgyz capital's 
state philharmonic society on January 16. A white racing horse 
and complete harness set were brought out on the stage and 
presented to the award winner, along with a hunting golden eagle 
and a national robe and cap. The ceremony was broadcast over 
republic television, and the recipient, in an acceptance speech 
that was delivered in Russian and met by the audience with 
stormy applause, urged that "splendid impulses be given to the 
fatherland's soul." The Uzbek press published a telegram of 
greetings signed by President Akayev, members of the government, 
and Kyrgyz oblast officials. 
  The Uzbek President is the third "Rukhaniyat" Association 
prizewinner, after President Akayev and President Nazarbayev. It 
is symbolic that the award ceremony was held immediately after 
President Akayev's trip to Osh Oblast, where the president was 
given a restrained welcome. The reason is that Osh Oblast is 
suffering from a shortage of gas from neighboring Uzbekistan. 
The situation has been compounded by an accident at an electric 
power station and a winter with record low temperatures. 
  Immediately after the award ceremony for Islam Karimov, he 
and President Akayev signed seven documents encompassing all 
aspects of economic cooperation. Kyrgyzstan acceded to the 
treaty establishing a single economic space between Uzbekistan 
and Kazakhstan. Documents regulating trade and reciprocal 
payments were signed. Under an agreement, customs barriers 
between the two republics will be lifted as of February 1. 
Finally, an agreement was reached on the cost of Uzbek gas 
transported to Kyrgyzstan: It will be 20 percent below the world 
price. This agreement is probably the most important thing that 
Kyrgyzstan had requested from its powerful neighbor, which has 
its hand on the gas pipeline valve. 
  Relations between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have been frosty 
at times in recent years. Tashkent has indicated on several 
occasions that it is not pleased with the "rampant democracy" in 
Kyrgyzstan and with the fact that Uzbek dissidents have found 
refuge on its territory. The incident involving the kidnapping 
of Uzbek human rights activist Abdumannob Pulatov by Uzbek 
intelligence services, which received wide publicity, failed to 
promote mutual understanding between Tashkent and Bishkek. The 
same is true of human rights conferences held in Bishkek, at 
which "Uzbekistan's totalitarian regime" has been sharply 
criticized. This may be why President Akayev, on the eve of 
Islam Karimov's visit to Bishkek, refused to allow Tursunbek 
Akunov, chairman of a nongovernmental human rights committee, to 
hold an international human rights congress in Issyk-Kul. 
According to some reports, the president's administration is 
drafting a document calling for closer ties between Kyrgyz 
public movements and political parties and Uzbek organizations. 
  President Askar Akayev has found himself in a truly 
difficult 
situation: On the one hand, he is under pressure from his own 
human rights activists and political parties; on the other hand, 
he faces economic problems whose solution depends in large part 
on his powerful neighbor. But Kyrgyzstan is now in a situation 
in which gas, needless to say, is more important that human 
rights.

Show; Pre-Session Rating of Republic's Leaders (Results of 
November Poll)"] 
  [Text] 
  [Begin boxed material] 
  In the period from 19 through 26 November of the current 
year, our sociological group conducted a routine questionnaire 
survey of respondents. 
  A total of 1,978 persons were polled. The sampling was 
distributed as follows: 
  BY REGIONS: In the city of Bishkek 272 respondents were 
surveyed; in Osh Oblast--623; in Dzhalal-Abad Oblast--359; in 
Issyk-Kula Oblast--191; in Naryn Oblast--109; in Chuysk 
Oblast--338, and in Talas Oblast--86 respondents. 
  BY SEX: Men - 1,034 (52.3 percent), women - 944 (47.7 
percent). 
  BY NATIONALITY: Kyrgyz - 1,217 persons (61.5 percent), 
Russians - 380 (19.2 percent), Uzbeks - 237 (12 percent), 
Kazakhs - 30 (1.5 percent), Germans - 25 (1.2 percent), and 
other nationalities - 89 (4.5 percent). 
  BY AGE: Respondents under 20 years of age - 158 persons (8 
percent); 20 to 29 years of age - 588 (29.7 percent); 30 to 39 
years of age - 604 (30.5 percent); 40 to 49 years of age - 388 
(19.6 percent); 50 to 59 years of age - 153 (7.7 percent), 60 
and over - 87 (4.4 percent). 
  BY OCCUPATION: Blue-collar workers - 398 (20.1 percent); 
workers in agriculture - 324 (16.4 percent); employees in state 
institutions - 878 (44.4 percent); entrepreneurs - 42 (2.1 
percent); students and trainees - 140 (7.1 percent); housewives 
and pensioners - 127 (6.4 percent); unemployed persons - 69 (3.5 
percent). 
  [End boxed material] 
  We posed a number of questions concerning the current 
socio-political situation in the republic. Today we present to 
the reader part of the responses, in which the respondents give 
an evaluation of the republic and oblast leadership, as well as 
their attitude toward the Constitution and the Zhogorku Kenesh. 
  The political processes during our transitional period are 
rather fast-moving. We believe many readers recall with 
nostalgia that "stagnant" period when certain leaders could 
spend decades at the head of structural subdivisions which 
provided comfortable positions for them. That time has passed, 
never to return. The political situation today changes 
practically every week. It is influenced by numerous factors, 
domestic as well as foreign, objective as well as subjective, 
central as well as regional. The effort by certain regions to 
exert pressure on the course of the current session was felt not 
only by the deputies, but also by inexperienced listeners and 
viewers. Therefore, in every case in our publications we also 
give readers the responses in a regional cross-section. (Tables 
1 and 2).

(cf. SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA, 18 December 1993). 
  Today we are presenting part of the responses to questions 
concerning the respondents' attitudes toward the political 
parties and their leaders. 
  [End boxed material] 
  The republic is gradually making the transition to a real 
multi-party system. Recently another party registered with the 
Ministry of Justice--the Agrarian Party. Altogether we have 
eight of them now. As yet it is difficult to say whether the 
process of party formation will stop here. We do not exclude the 
possibility of formation of other parties as well. 
  In speaking of the formulation of a real multi-party system, 
we must also point out the December session of the Zhogorku 
Kenesh which, in our opinion, will be memorable also in the fact 
that for the first time the legislators decided to listen to the 
opinion of the parties. All the parties of Kyrgyzstan will be 
able to enter the date of 14 December in their chronicles as a 
day of reckoning in their formulation: The deputy corps listened 
to the opinion of the party leaders regarding the vacant 
position of prime minister. 
  The tables presented below (N1, 2, 3) show the weight of the 
parties by regional, national and age parameters. Without 
commenting on them in detail, we will focus on two figures. In 
first place by a sizeable margin are the communists. This is the 
only party which has surpassed, and quite significantly, the 
10-percent margin. In principle it is understandable why this is 
happening: The complexities of the republic's socio-economic 
development are forcing ordinary residents to recall that 
"golden" time when the communists ruled and prices were 
affordable. The situation which is developing in the economy and 
our as yet bleak prospects will evidently lead to a further 
increase in the authority of the republic's communists. 
  The second figure which calls attention to itself is the 
percent of those who found it difficult to respond. On the whole 
throughout the republic, over one-third of the respondents could 
not define themselves on this question. Here is the sphere of 
activity for our parties. 
  Table N4 gives the rating of party leaders in points. Here 
too the communists draw attention to themselves. Their leader, 
Zhumgalbek Amanbayev, is in first place among the leaders of the 
political parties. An informal rating conducted among deputies 
of the Zhogorku Kenesh also gave priority to the leader of the 
communists. 
  We will not comment further on the tables. The next survey 
will probably be conducted at the beginning of January, and we 
hope to present a detailed report to our readers in the last 
third of January.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhumagul Saadanbekov, oblast chief of </F>
administration in Kyrgyzstan, by A. Malevanyy, editor in chief 
of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA; place and date not given: "Zhumagul 
Saadanbekov: `I Belong to That Generation of Politicians Who Are 
Returning From the Market'"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Instead of a Preface </H5>
  I worked with Zhumagul Saadanbekov for many years. I 
have seen him in various situations. And I can testify: You 
cannot conduct his level of politics on such (excuse me) trash 
as tribalism. It is too simple and absurd. 
  But what, nonetheless, happened? Why has his name been 
cropping up in the press in recent weeks in connection 
specifically with tribalism, against which, it will be recalled, 
he spoke violently and furiously, obeying his conscience and 
convictions? Zh. Saadanbekov himself answers these and other 
questions today. I am confident that the inquisitive reader, 
scrutinizing his answers, will judge intelligently and soberly 
and will understand what is what. [Signed] A. Malevanyy, editor 
in chief of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA. 
  [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, how did it happen that 
one day you suddenly became the personification of tribalism? 
  [Saadanbekov] Everyone knows the traditional methods of any 
opposition. There is populism here, and the fight against 
privileges, and the accusations of corruption and of tribalism, 
and other innumerable "isms." The people, thank God, are already 
developing a certain immunity to this kind of manifestation of 
opposition combat. 
  But why did my generally inoffensive declaration to the 
deputies of my oblast to stay behind in the hall for 
consultations during the break evoke furious anger and 
indignation in the opposition camp, while at the same time very 
few reacted when the Supreme Council under the "flexible" 
leadership of the speaker encroached on the Constitution of the 
republic and rudely smashed it? 
  The fact is that long before the session, while speaking on 
television, I predicted, and it turns out now very correctly, 
impending battles at the Supreme Council session. In particular, 
I said that it would become an arena of political fights of the 
two branches of authority--the representative and the 
executive--and the arena of a crudely selfish fight for 
portfolios in the government. I said this not because I have any 
kind of biased attitude toward the Supreme Council and its 
leadership. But because in all of the republics of the former 
USSR, the mutual relations of the legislative and executive 
branches of authority up to now developed or are developing 
sharply, and by means of conflict. And this is not accidental. 
Our society and our people were brought up under conditions of 
the monolithic authority of the CPSU. Even Zyuganov, the leader 
of the communists of Russia, today recognizes that the CPSU was 
not a party, but a monolithic hierarchical state structure. We 
did not know what the division of power was. We knew only one 
authority--the authority of the rayon political committees, the 
oblast political committees, and the Central Committee. 
  After the August putsch of 1991, the CPSU left the political 
arena. All of the republics, based, of course, on good 
intentions, implemented the separation of three branches of 
authority. But it soon turned out that everywhere, with the 
exception, perhaps, of the Baltic republics, conditions did not 
mature for their civilized interaction. From Moldova and Ukraine 
to the very ends of Russia and Central Asia, a struggle for 
power evolved between the soviets and the executive structures. 
Everyone knows how it all ended. Parliament was dissolved in 
Russia with salvos from tank guns, and in Azerbaijan, just the 
opposite, the defeat of the executive structure was crowned with 
the flight of Elchibey. In Kazakhstan, this fight ended with the 
self-dissolution of the entire vertical of soviets, etc., and 
the like. 
  Today, various politicians are talking profusely in the 
Supreme Council: They say that Kyrgyzstan is an exception in 
this process, that we have calm and plenty, that our "legendary" 
parliament does not think about power, etc. But then what kind 
of evil forces (having in mind Saadanbekov most of all) think 
and act otherwise. Indeed, a lot of them! 
  The very first day of the Supreme Council session fully 
confirmed my assumptions. Unexpectedly for many, it began with 
the report of the speaker and demands for his resignation. But 
this kind of outcome was prevented. And at this point, an 
unheard-of tragicomedy unfolded, an inevitable fight for the 
chair of the prime minister and ministerial portfolios. 
Everything was put into motion--from violations of procedure and 
the Constitution to threats by individual deputies. His majesty 
"Interest" united everyone--leftist extremists and social 
democrats, liberals and orthodox communists, political plebeians 
and the political elite. The decisive force was a vector 
consisting of three components: 
  1. The offended, or the so-called "BU" [previously 
discharged]; 
  2. Contenders for portfolios; 
  3. Individual very contradictory, but powerful, regional 
forces. 
  And what is most important, all of them concurred with the 
desires and interests of the higher leadership of the Supreme 
Council. 
  This "Afanasyev majority" was opposed by 104 deputies from 
all regions of the republic. Among them is national poet Zhalil 
Sadykov, the well-known entrepreneur Yu. Dunlarov, the prominent 
public and political figure Zh. Akimaliyev, the heads of rayon 
administrations B. Silayev, Zh. Zhamankulov, and others. 
  [Malevanyy] And nevertheless, what have you to do with it, 
and where did this label of tribalism come from? 
  [Saadanbekov] As I already said, it was I who, even before 
the session, disclosed both the global and the specific reasons 
for the impending fight for power; I sharply criticized the 
Presidium of the Supreme Council and many parties and movements 
that directly or indirectly are exaggerating the notorious 
question of gold for unseemly purposes. Could they excuse me for 
all of this? No. They waited for an opportune moment in order to 
deliver a blow. And they found it. They charged that my 
statement to the deputies of Issyk-Kul Oblast was the sin of 
tribalism. Almost a half million multiethnic and multifaced 
people live in our oblast, and it is absurd to attribute some 
kind of one-dimensional mentality to its deputy staff. The 
deputation of the oblast represents very opposite positions. For 
example, Deputies Idinov, Kalashnikov, Novikov, and many others 
not only did not support, but even fought against the position 
of the 104 deputies. Incidentally, among the 104 deputies, a 
little more than 30 are from Issyk-Kul Oblast. 
  But if we are talking substance, then, of course, tribalism 
is regional egoism--it is an evil, and it is our misfortune, 
about which I speak continuously and consistently. And I not 
only talk, but I also act. In the last year and a half to two 
years, we were the first in the oblast to begin the rotation of 
the chief of the rayon administrations. The now-deceased Madiyev 
Eshimkan, the chief of administration of Issyk-Kulskiy Rayon, 
was from Talass Oblast, and the present head of this same rayon, 
Mukhtarov Erkin, is a native of Osh Oblast. The chief of the 
oblast UVD [administration of internal affairs]--People's Deputy 
M. Abdyldayev--is a native Bishkekian, and several chiefs of 
oblast administrations come from Narynsk and Chu Oblasts, and so 
on. Almost half of the personnel and the managerial staff of the 
power structures are also from other oblasts of the republic. 
  [Malevanyy] You are being blamed for protecting former Prime 
Minister T. Chyngyshev and that for the sake of keeping him in 
his post you almost used forceful means to compel the deputies 
of Issyk-Kul Oblast to vote collectively for confidence in 
Chyngyshev's government. Is he really from the same place that 
you are? And what kind of letter is it that was signed by 104 
deputies in defense of the prime minister, which, as is 
asserted, was organized by you? 
  [Saadanbekov] Yes, Chyngyshev is from the same place I am. 
But if someone else were in his place, for example, Eshmatov 
from Osh Oblast, I would just as fiercely defend him as I would 
Chyngyshev in the same situation. Deputy Sh. Mambetov is also 
from the same place I am. I think that he did a lot of damage to 
the Kumtor contract. And if a person from another region were in 
his place, I would fight against him exactly as against Mambetov. 
  Chyngyshev left. A new government was formed. It was headed 
by Apas Dzhumagulov, an experienced administrator, and a loyal 
and moderate politician. I believe that he will become a 
consolidating figure, uniting all forces. 
  When I am accused of tribalism, I recall the plenum of the 
Central Committee on the eve of the first session of the Supreme 
Council of this convocation. At that time, the party apparatus, 
the KGB, and other repressive organs were omnipotent and mighty. 
But at that time, I came out against all of them and put forth 
the candidacy of Apas Dzhumagulovich for the post of chairman of 
the Supreme Council as an alternative to A. Masaliyev. 
Persecution, shadowing, and prosecution started. A little later 
I established and headed the "deputy group of 114." The Supreme 
Council approached the presidential elections through our 
efforts. There were three contenders in the first stage: A. 
Masaliyev, Dzh. Amanbayev, and A. Dzhumagulov. It was precisely 
at my initiative as the manager of the group that our faction 
fought for Dzhumagulov, and not for Amanbayev, who comes from my 
area. Where in those difficult times were today's ardent 
fighters for democracy and enemies of tribalism? 
  As for those 104 deputies about whom you are asking, they 
united in behalf of the defense of the Constitution, but not for 
the defense of Chyngyshev or other persons. All it takes is to 
violate the Constitution one time, when the destructive process 
will begin to reshape it thoroughly. That is why when the 
Supreme Council, after violating the Constitution, knocked 
Chyngyshev out of his post, the president was compelled to 
request the resignation of the entire government. In this way, 
he saved the face not so much of Chyngyshev as of the Supreme 
Council, and he saved the Constitution. 
  [Malevanyy] Do you yourself belong to any kind of a party? 
  [Saadanbekov] No. 
  [Malevanyy] How did you interpret the statement of the 
leaders of political parties and movements, in which they insist 
on removing you from the position of oblast chief of 
administration? 
  [Saadanbekov] Most of all, it is amazing and amusing. I long 
ago thought that we were living under a democratic system, and 
that the Bolshevist method of selection had vanished in the 
summer. It seems that the danger of a return of 1937 has not 
passed. It appears that I am threatening the state integrity of 
the republic, and that it is necessary therefore to dismiss me 
from the post of the chief of administration immediately. And 
people are writing this who consider themselves democrats. 
Incidentally, among them are E. Aliyev and Zh. Zheksheyev, who 
come from the same area that I do. Not knowing this themselves, 
the signers drove themselves into an ideological swamp. There is 
a new century outside and fresh winds of democracy, but they are 
arming themselves with the Bolshevist club of violence. In 
essence, both the extreme right and the extreme left radicals 
are Bolsheviks, only with a different symbol. 
  [Malevanyy] In your time, you were one of the creators in 
the 
Supreme Council of the opposition platform of the "group of 
114"; that is, you rendered definite services to democracy and 
the "silk revolution" that took place in the country. And 
suddenly everything is forgotten and discarded, and a wave force 
of nine of rejection both from the side of part of the deputy 
corps as well as of political parties is being raised around 
your name. What has caused this, the change of direction of your 
positions to the right, an evolution of views, or do you see 
something else here, and what specifically, then? 
  [Saadanbekov] It is necessary to look into the peculiarities 
of mass psychology. You recall when, at the last session of the 
Supreme Council of the previous convocation, I was one of the 
first to raise the question about national state sovereignty and 
about a state language, literally an explosion occurred in the 
social conscience, and here, there, and everywhere they 
applauded, standing. You remember the story with Khrustalov's 
notorious article "Duplicity," when I, risking everything, 
defended the right of the existence of national traditions and 
customs, and society applauded warmly at that time. Society 
accepted and applauded when we completed, as they say, the "silk 
revolution." 
  But apparently the social nature of the mass psychology is 
such that a lot is forgotten quickly. I saw with my own eyes how 
people calmly gazed at the swastika that adorned the walls, they 
read fascist leaflets, laughing while walking along and, 
shrugging their shoulders, went past a mob that declared: "We 
are the black hundred." To what extent have people forgotten 
everything! They have forgotten the known and unknown soldiers 
who believed that they were fighting against fascism, and they 
betrayed them. They betrayed relatives and friends, the millions 
who perished on the GULAG islands and indifferently looked at 
the rallies of Anpilov and Barkashov. Only in a society that is 
stricken with a lack of memory and an absence of disgust can be 
like this. But Kyrgyzstan's umbilical cord is still firmly tied 
to that society where for the time being the Zhirinovskiys are 
winning victories. 
  You talk of my rejection by a part of the deputy corps. And 
here the psychological effect begins to work--the effect of 
delayed vengeance. Perhaps they can really forgive one of the 
authors of the "silk revolution"; that is, those who still yearn 
for the "golden age" of stagnation, those who lost their party 
chairs and privileges. Perhaps the new aggrieved and the new 
"previously discharged persons" can forgive me when I still find 
myself in the epicenter of democratic reforms, which are moving 
slowly, with difficulty, and that frequently run into rejection 
by the broad masses. 
  And more. I am one of those who frequently dares to say 
unpopular and painful things in the interests of the psychic 
health of society. Social conscience cannot base itself on 
stereotypes and fraud. Individual political parties, for 
example, are betting on national prejudices and antipathies. I 
cannot reconcile myself with such a statement of the question, 
and I criticize them openly. I also criticize for primitive 
populism, for neo-Bolshevist ways, for the lack of clear 
political positions and a social base. And it is understandable 
why they undertook a reprisal against the obstinate Saadanbekov 
in an organized way. 
  As for my positions and views, of course, they are changing 
and are corrected in the channel of the dialectics of real life. 
But the core of my position was and remains common sense 
everywhere and pragmatism in everything. 
  [Malevanyy] I happened to hear that your trip to Canada this 
year allegedly was financed by Kameko and that henceforth you 
are obligated to this firm. Is this so? 
  [Saadanbekov] The trip to Canada was official. For nine days 
I visited mines, pits, enterprises, and projects of institutes, 
banks, and funds of the Kameko firm. We were shown in detail the 
conditions of life and labor of the workers, we were shown the 
newest technologies, dwellings, and the infrastructure that it 
is planned to introduce in Kumtor. We discussed future variants 
of accommodating manpower, food, transport, building, and 
material technical support for implementing the Kumtor project. 
  The Kameko Corporation is one of the world's largest 
producers of uranium working at low costs. Moreover, it is 
engaged in prospecting for and extracting copper, zinc, and 
diamonds. 
  Kameko's property on 1 January 1993 was valued at $1.3 
billion. According to the results of nine months of this year, 
the net income of the company totaled $197.8 million, as 
compared with $184.3 million for the corresponding period in 
1992. According to the data of expert organizations, Kameko is 
easily able to invest up to $100 million per year. 
  And this investor, recognized in the whole world, has been 
subjected to insults in our country for more than half a year, 
and it is slanderously suspected of all kinds of thinkable and 
unthinkable sins. Do the enemies of this project realize what 
immeasurable damage and what kind of unjustified offense they 
are committing against their own people and their future, if 
this corporation leaves us due to their pressure? 
  [Malevanyy] What is your estimate of the political situation 
in the republic? Do you think that the change in government will 
play a stabilizing role? Your prognosis for the near future? 
  [Saadanbekov] The political situation, if it is examined in 
a 
global context, is normal. A quite normal democratic struggle 
for power is going on in a normal democratic society. Only in 
this struggle, a neo-Bolshevist propensity for reprisal against 
dissidents is not permissible. I think that the change in 
government and an especially successful outcome of the 
forthcoming referendum will stabilize the situation more 
profoundly. 
  Regarding the prognosis, this is a thankless and very tricky 
undertaking. It is better to live with hope and faith. This is 
simply necessary for a person in our difficult time. 
  [Malevanyy] You are frequently reproached for political 
ambition: It is said that you see yourself at one moment in the 
speaker's position, then in the chair of the prime minister, and 
even in the chair of the president. And that you are 
subordinating today's tactics to the achievement of one of these 
aims, and that you are even conducting some kind of 
behind-the-scenes game. What do you say in this regard? 
  [Saadanbekov] There is a Russian proverb that says: "People 
are coming from the market, but Nazar is going to the market." I 
already belong to that generation of politicians that are 
returning from the market. It is necessary to clear the way for 
the young. We have talented and very promising youth. It is 
necessary to foster and continuously cultivate them. Not to 
interfere, and not to trip them up, as our individual Nazars are 
doing today. Thus, I assure you that I have no pretensions to 
the aforementioned posts. 
  At the session of the Supreme Soviet, when a president was 
being elected, I was the only one who removed his candidacy out 
of moral considerations, and I advised the leaders of the 
Central Committee at that time to follow my example. They did 
not heed me, and they suffered defeat. It is my profound 
conviction that politics should be built on principles of 
morality. I do not acknowledge the position that politics is 
really dirty work, but we, they say, are clean. It is this kind 
of approach that makes politics dirty. But it should be the 
opposite, work that is very clean and a service to the citizens. 
We must not leave this sphere of work to people who are 
dishonorable; this will cause damage, it is a betrayal of the 
intellect itself, and the abandonment of responsibility for the 
world around us. Politics should be engaged in by people who are 
the most selfless and the most sagacious, the kind who better 
than others see the common connection in various phenomena. 
  As for my political ambition and my kind of 
behind-the-scenes 
games, this is being written about by two or three inveterate 
yellow-press newspapers. I do not read the hogwash with which 
they regale a narrow circle of readers, holding them to be 
loonies. I am a normal person who has his work, thoughts, 
family, hopes, and faith, and, therefore, I am not interested in 
the ideological prostitution of aggressive ignoramuses who 
thirst, as the classic often used to say, "to play a role" at 
any price. 
  [Malevanyy] Zhumagul Saadanbekovich, in light of the recent 
elections in Russia, what will be the fate of democracy in our 
country, and will it not collapse under the weight of economic 
conditions and political reprisals? 
  [Saadanbekov] Some kind of cave-in has occurred with these 
elections in Russia. It is very difficult to rethink and realize 
all of this, but one thing is clear. Democracy suffered a 
serious defeat. And it serves the democrats of Russia right. As 
it is here, they have not had unity for a long time, and they 
literally fought among themselves. Many democrats stood on the 
sidelines in a struggle that was going on not for life, but to 
the death between the representative and executive branches of 
power. 
  But the same thing, if not worse, is going on in our 
republic 
in the democratic camp. Few of the democrats remain, as they 
say, of the first callup, the first wave, with genuine 
democratic convictions. Some slammed the door loudly and made 
for the near abroad, and others head the opposition to the 
government. Still others, working in the executive structure, 
show themselves to be in no way better than the former 
officials. The democratic movement today abounds in selfish, 
arrogant, and foolish people. 
  The people are tired of their dilettantism, from the complex 
of failures who on a wave of criticism became deputies and 
entered the government structure, but who cannot work. They 
replace genuine activity with the appearance of activity. 
Because these people, from one side and the other, do not know 
how to work. Some of them absolutely do not fit the position 
they occupy; therefore, they put everything they have into a 
fight with someone. But if you are fighting with somebody, you 
do not have to work, and then it is sufficient to devise 
scathing arguments against one's opponent. All of them joined 
the democrats, when this was safe and even prestigious, and it 
also promised dividends. After all, there is nothing more 
gratifying than to join the victor, and to stand under 
victorious banners. This turn left a mark on both the character 
of the movement and on its individual activists. 
  I think that today's leaders of the democratic movement are 
capable of realizing the situation and that they will draw the 
appropriate conclusions, that they will achieve unity and 
agreement within their ranks, and that they will shift its 
activity onto constructive and creative tracks. 
  Today, no matter who we are according to party convictions, 
we should have one aim--to lead the country out of the economic 
crisis. To throw all our forces into a revival of the economy. 
Because the economy contains in itself the greatest capability 
for organizing society. When people are engaged in work, they do 
not have the time to be involved with nonsense.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Madalbek Moldashev, chief of the </F>
Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of the State 
Committee for National Security of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, 
by T. Razakov, director of the State Committee for National 
Security press service; place and date not given: "Military 
Counterintelligence in Kyrgyzstan. What Does It Do?"] 
  [Text] The Directorate of Military 
Counterintelligence was organized for the first time in the 
State Committee for National Security [GKNB] of the Republic of 
Kyrgyzstan a little more than a year ago. Considering that one 
frequently hears talk of late regarding an alleged increase in 
the staff of employees of the security organs, we decided to 
meet with Colonel Madalbek Moldashev, chief of the GKNB 
Directorate of Military Counterintelligence. 
  [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, as we know, there was a 
counterintelligence subunit in the system of the USSR KGB for a 
long time, and now there is one in the republic GKNB. What 
prompted the creation of yet another structure: the Directorate 
of Military Counterintelligence. 
  [Moldashev] The disintegration of the former USSR forced a 
reexamination of the problems of guaranteeing the national 
security of each of the republics. In addition, the 
military-political situation, the operational situation, the 
condition of the economy, and strategic tasks for strengthening 
the territorial integrity and independence of the state were 
taken into account. 
  Previously in the USSR Armed Forces, work was conducted in a 
centralized way by special departments that were directly 
subordinate to the USSR KGB. There were no military 
counterintelligence organs in the KGB structures of the former 
Union republics. 
  The formation by each of the republics of their own Armed 
Forces made it necessary for all national intelligence services 
to revise the concept of guaranteeing state security as a whole 
and to establish their own structures of military 
counterintelligence organs. By a decision of the government, the 
Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of the GKNB was 
organized in August last year. 
  [Razakov] Is this a concession to fashion and a copying of 
the activity of near and distant neighbors, or is it a search 
for new positions in the structure of the GKNB? 
  [Moldashev] In the period of the division of the USSR Armed 
Forces into national forces and the disintegration of the USSR 
KGB (1990-1992), for a number of subjective and objective 
reasons the activity of counterintelligence organs on the 
territory of the former Union republics practically stopped, and 
in individual cases their work was of a formal nature. Military 
counterintelligence personnel, like many army servicemen, were 
engaged only in arranging personal matters, and began to leave 
Kyrgyzstan in a massive way. A situation of lack of control 
developed in military units and subunits, and even 
permissiveness in some places. 
  In such a situation, our "talented" compatriots quickly 
devised (with the active participation of high-ranking military 
chiefs and representatives of the shadow economy) a clever 
mechanism for the sale of military equipment, theft and 
appropriation of weapons and ammunition, sale of military 
property at cheap prices, and the transport of material 
valuables outside the republic's boundaries. Abuse of service 
position became a daily occurrence. Military discipline fell 
sharply. The situation in the army environment heated up because 
of failure to resolve social and everyday problems. The danger 
of the emergence of groups of lawbreakers among servicemen and 
their getting together with organized crime increased. 
  Moreover, the newly created armed forces of a sovereign 
republic should be reliably guarded against the subversive 
activity of foreign intelligence services, criminal 
encroachments, and also from the involvement of servicemen in 
antistate and antisocial activity. 
  [Razakov] Could you briefly disclose the mechanism of thefts 
and abuses in the army? 
  [Moldashev] The arsenal of methods used is very broad. In 
particular, in the period indicated above about 200 units of 
various kinds of army motor vehicles were sold to private 
persons and cooperative enterprises. Fake documents, invalid 
stamps, and figurehead persons were employed, new vehicles were 
written off as obsolete ahead of time, there was registration 
only of documents--given the absence of the motor vehicles 
themselves, accounting data was artificially muddled up, record 
and accounting documents were destroyed ahead of schedule, etc. 
  Semiautomatic combat weapons with ammunition were sold at a 
symbolic price to military and civilian persons who quickly 
became members of a hunting society. 
  Servicemen were sent on so-called official business outside 
the republic on service motor vehicles and transported stolen 
military property on the way using the pretext that it was 
household goods, and the vehicle was lost without a trace in the 
vast expanse of a previously united fatherland. 
  [Razakov] But will military counterintelligence not replace 
organs of the MVD or the military procurator? 
  [Moldashev] In no way. On the whole, counterintelligence is 
intended to give warning of and prevent state crimes in military 
units and formations placed by legislation of the republic 
within the purview of organs of national security, and it does 
not duplicate the functions of either command elements, the 
procuracy, or the militia. 
  We cooperate closely with the aforementioned organs in the 
course of preliminary inquiry as well as in investigations. For 
example, in December last year in Bishkek a motor vehicle was 
blown up with the participation of a serviceman; one person was 
killed and a second incurred serious injuries. Organs of 
military counterintelligence, the MVD, GKNB subunits, and the 
military procuracy joined in the operational investigation and 
the legal procedure measures, which produced positive results. 
  This kind of "tandem" in activity, in which each side worked 
out its own questions, is a frequent practice in the 
investigation of stolen or seized weapons, in the prevention of 
illegal exports of material valuables, etc. 
  [Razakov] Could you shed light on the "main thrust" of the 
directorate that you manage? 
  [Moldashev] It is obvious that all the negative processes 
that occur in society are reflected in the armed forces as if in 
a mirror. Among servicemen (considering the self-discipline, 
access to armaments, combat qualifications, low material level, 
domestic disorder, and other factors), social problems take on a 
special acuteness, which representatives of the crime-conducive 
environment attempt to exploit. 
  In comparison with the "so-called stagnation period," 
interest on the part of individual persons in combat arms, 
ammunition, and equipment has constantly increased inasmuch as 
they are becoming not only a weapon of violence but also a 
subject of profit. In contrast to past years of armed conflict 
in Tajikistan, the Caucasus has increased the demand for army 
equipment, and "hunter-gatherers" from these regions have become 
frequent. Therefore, we are undertaking all measures to erect 
barriers on the probable routes of thefts, seizures, losses, 
sales, and illegal exports of weapons, munitions, and equipment. 
  The ever-increasing flow of incoming drugs represents a 
great 
danger for the army in connection with a weakening of the regime 
of protection of the Afghan-Tajik border. The timely blocking of 
drug entry and distribution channels is one of our urgent tasks. 
  On behalf of stability in society we are obligated to guard 
servicemen from the spreading influence of Islamic 
fundamentalism and not to permit them to become drawn into 
extremist groups--given a respectful attitude toward everyone's 
religious convictions. 
  The presence in the army of various armaments, combat 
equipment, and explosives does not exclude attempts on the part 
of individual persons to employ them for sabotage and terrorist 
purposes. In the whole world extremist groups see the resolution 
of political, social, and personal problems in terror, or in 
sabotage. Therefore, the fight against terrorist and sabotage 
phenomena among troops and their surroundings has not lost its 
urgency for us. 
  I have talked only about some aspects of our work, inasmuch 
as, despite the atmosphere of glasnost, there are still spheres 
of our work that should not be divulged. 
  [Razakov] What are the results of the activity of your 
employees? 
  [Moldashev] Together with the organs of the MVD and the 
military procuracy it has been possible to expose and stop a 
number of criminal acts. On the basis of information sent by the 
Directorate of the VKR [military counterintelligence] to MVD 
organs, more than a dozen criminal cases have been initiated. 
Employees of the republic military counterintelligence have 
uncovered more than a dozen units of firearms and more than 
15,000 munitions of various calibers, which were unaccounted for 
and could have been stolen, at depots of military units. 
  In the course of operational-search measures conducted 
jointly with organs of the MVD, the procuracy, and GKNB 
subunits, stolen assault rifles, pistols, cartridges, combat 
grenades, and bayonet-knives for assault rifles have been 
confiscated from criminals and returned to the troops. 
  The VKR branch of the Osh garrison has uncovered cases of 
plundering of the motor pool, with the subsequent sale of 
assemblies and parts removed from motor vehicles. The loss 
caused by the culprits has been restored. 
  Attempts by a number of officers, who were leaving for a new 
place of service, to transport outside the republic's boundaries 
stolen military equipment in the sum of more than 2 million 
rubles [R] in 1991 prices have been suppressed. In the 
investigative stage a number of other materials in similar kinds 
of crimes are being found. 
  In August 1993, owing to joint measures adopted in a timely 
way, the illegal transport beyond the borders of the republic of 
military equipment, armaments, and ammunition of an Air Defense 
subunit deployed in the south was prevented. 
  Employees of this same branch in cooperation with organs of 
the procuracy arrested an officers of the military commissariat 
during the acquisition of bribes by means of extortion. 
  In July 1993 information was received concerning imminent 
conflict between a group of sergeants and newly called-up 
soldiers on the grounds of nonregulation treatment. To take 
revenge, the latter were preparing a physical reprisal against 
the offenders, and as a sign of protest against the commanders 
for failure to take steps to stop the tyranny were planning to 
set fire to the barracks. The timely measures that were taken 
made it possible to prevent an emergency situation and 
neutralize the conflict. The military procuracy is conducting an 
investigation into this case. 
  Work conducted by us to guard about 800 kilograms of 
precious 
metals in used up parts and assemblies in troop units made it 
possible to prevent their theft or illegal acquisition by 
questionable commercial structures. It is too early to talk 
about a number of materials that are in production and are 
undergoing a double-check. 
  [Razakov] At present all law enforcement organs are 
experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel, including the 
GKNB, due to the departure of experienced employees. Apparently, 
your directorate is not an exception? How is the personnel 
problem being resolved? 
  [Moldashev] Selection of candidates is being conducted among 
officers of the active military service or the reserve. We are 
enlisting graduates of civilian VUZ's [higher educational 
institution]. Despite a not very high salary, the absence of 
apartments, and the need to move from a long-occupied place, 
there are quite a few who want to become military 
counterintelligence personnel, which indicates that many people 
are not indifferent to the fate of our young state and the 
future of our society. However, not everyone is able to pass our 
"exams" successfully and become enlisted. 
  Our collective is interethnic. In personnel selection we 
distance ourselves from tribalism, protectionism, and 
regionalism. In processing for service and assessment of the 
work of each employee, the primary criteria are devotion to 
duty, readiness to serve the fatherland, personal and work 
characteristics, and also objective indicators of effective 
service activity. 
  There are undoubtedly also officers among the military 
counterintelligence personnel who desire to serve in other 
regions. We are not dramatizing such attempts, understanding the 
vital interests of those who are departing. 
  Our directorate is also experiencing an acute shortage of 
qualified personnel. At the present time two-thirds of our 
employees do not have operational work experience. Their 
professional formation is being delayed because of absence of 
special knowledge, which was previously acquired in academic 
training institutions of the USSR KGB. 
  Due to economic difficulties we are still unable to send our 
personnel for training in other CIS republics. 
  Therefore, under the pressure of circumstances short courses 
have started to function in the GKNB, in which the students go 
through initial counterintelligence training. We are confident 
that life will force us to have our own full-fledged training 
base. 
  Thus, military counterintelligence, the GKNB, as well as 
society on the whole, are living through difficult times, in 
which the resolution of small questions is transformed into 
problems that are difficult to overcome. 
  [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, we cannot avoid the 
traditional question: How did you end up being the chief of the 
directorate? 
  [Moldashev] After receiving a special higher education in 
Novosibirsk and Moscow, I served for a long time in military 
counterintelligence. I took part in combat operations in 
Afghanistan for more than three years. I devoted many of my 45 
years of life to intelligence work and pedagogical activity. 
  Thus, I am a relatively new person in Kyrgyzstan, inasmuch 
as 
all my previous service was spent within the borders of the 
former state. 
  In April 1992 I decided to return to the motherland and 
render as much assistance as possible to the formation of our 
own sovereign state. Taking into account my knowledge, 
professional and vital experience, and the practice of my 
previous service, the leadership of the GKNB entrusted me with 
the creation of a military counterintelligence structure, on 
whose formation I am working to this day.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rustam Usmanov, Uzbek entrepreneur, </F>
president of the private Rustambank, and deputy chairman of the 
Republic Commission on Control of Economic Reforms, by Vladimir 
Polupanov under the rubric "Nations and Foreign Countries"; 
place and date not given: "Will Central Asia Enter the Market 
Path? Uzbekistan at the Crossroads..."] 
  [Text] To criticize the actions of the government is 
an ignoble deed, especially if the government is Central Asian. 
Therefore one can only guess why Uzbek entrepreneur Rustam 
Usmanov is forgiven for any negative statements he makes against 
the government. Moreover, he is the president of the only 
private bank in the republic (Rustambank) and also deputy 
chairman of the Republic Commission on Control of Economic 
Reforms, whose edict on conducting them was recently signed by 
Islam Karimov. 
  [Polupanov] What does Uzbekistan's economic reform consist 
of? They say that it is oriented toward the Turkish model. 
  [Usmanov] Since the first days of the republic's 
independence 
our president has been travelling through various countries. He 
visited Turkey and then discussed the Turkish version. When he 
arrived home from Germany he discussed the German model. But our 
local journalists, not understanding that Karimov was simply 
discussing the experience of these countries, decided that we 
want to follow Turkey's path. As of today there are certain bad 
subordinates in the president's inner circle and they are doing 
him a disservice. In the autumn I travelled through the fields 
of Andizhan, Fergana, and Namangan Oblasts. It was raining and 
the children were picking cotton. They were experiencing 
"percentomania" again. I spoke with the leaders of certain 
oblasts. They said that Tashkent was forcing them to do this. 
Nothing of the kind. Islam Karimov has said that the oblast 
authorities should not intervene in the affairs of agricultural 
workers. The economy stands only to lose when enterprises are 
closed and the people are working in the fields. Losses will not 
be covered from the sale of this costly cotton. 
  [Polupanov] The administrative-command system of management 
is being retained in the republic as it was before. Under these 
conditions, how is it possible to switch to the market? 
  [Usmanov] I agree, our system is authoritarian, but with a 
human face. Today it is our only chance of preserving political 
stability in the republic. We do not want a Karabakh and we do 
not want a Dniester region. Conditions are not yet ripe for 
transition to the market in Uzbekistan. Gradually a new 
foundation will be placed under the old edifice of the economy. 
Regardless of how much our friends and enemies may say that 
Uzbekistan has no democracy, that will change nothing. Today we 
have the kind of authority we need. 
  [Polupanov] The first thing that strikes a Muscovite 
arriving 
in Tashkent is the absence of a broad network of commercial 
stores. 
  [Usmanov] All our goods used to be distributed through state 
structures. And the people sitting there were able to line their 
pockets fairly well from this. Therefore they first gave 
permission for private entrepreneurial activity and then they 
banned it, understanding that they were being deprived of easy 
money. Today under the laws I have the right to open my own 
commercial store. But at the same time there is in force a 
telegram from the republic's deputy prime minister prohibiting 
me from selling certain groups of goods that are produced in the 
republic. There are certain other stores in Tashkent, but in the 
rayons they have closed them down, blaming the telegram. 
Therefore the commercial stores have lost their opportunity to 
trade legally and have gone underground. Of course, nobody pays 
taxes. 
  [Polupanov] And how are they now? 
  [Usmanov] Very high. Entrepreneurs have to pay a total of up 
to 70 percent of their profit. But I know of merchants who 
operate illegally whose monthly turnover reaches a billion 
rubles. Many of our businessmen leave to do business in 
neighboring republics and the majority of them are working in 
Moscow. I am very sorry that the republic is losing these people 
because today it is necessary to spend a considerable amount of 
money on training personnel like them. But perhaps Karimov's 
recently signed edict will motivate these people to work in the 
republic. Until 1 July 1995 customs duties have been removed 
from imports of all kinds of goods brought into Uzbekistan, and 
the conditions for issuing licenses for trade have finally been 
abolished. 
  [Polupanov] There has been a lot of discussion of the 
sum-coupon recently. Among people there is the opinion that 
Uzbekistan was forced to change over to its own currency and 
that Russia is to blame for this. They say that anti-Russian 
sentiments in Uzbekistan have grown stronger because of this. 
  [Usmanov] There can be no anti-Russian sentiments in the 
republic. Because our people are international by nature. 
Regardless of who our neighbor may be, the Uzbek will respect 
him under the condition that he is a good neighbor. 
  Our republic uses somewhere around 50 percent of its 
national 
income for subsidies in order to maintain prices for gasoline, 
bread, and so forth. That is why we held back for a certain 
amount of time. After Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan introduced 
their own money, all the mass of rubles rushed to us. These 
monetary notes are the obligation of the Central Bank of Russia 
to us. After issuing us this money, Russia received goods from 
us. Therefore it was simply obligated to exchange this money for 
new money. Or return our goods to us. But, on the other hand, 
the requirements the Russian Government established for creating 
a ruble zone I consider to be just. 
  [Polupanov] Are you speaking about the gold reserve? 
  [Usmanov] Both about the gold reserve and about the fact 
that 
our Central Bank must report to the Central Bank of Russia. But 
the exchange rate of 1:3 at which Russia suggests we exchange 
our money I consider to be illegal, there is no such exchange 
rate. 
  Four months ago the buying power of the Uzbek ruble was much 
greater than the Russian one. Today Russia is playing dirty. It 
is giving 1993 Russian money to Tajikistan in order to pump out 
our resources more cheaply through this republic. They want 
Tajikistan's help in bringing the Asian republics to their knees 
before Russia. It is not difficult to guess where the breaking 
of ties among the republics will lead. Even today some of our 
entrepreneurs are working three or four days a week. We are 
losing Russia as a supplier of raw material and a market for 
selling our goods. But Russia does not understand that its own 
situation is getting worse too. The Central Asian region 
includes about 60 million people. This is a large market for 
selling Russian goods, which cannot compete in the West. But we 
will not get down on our knees before Russia, we will find other 
partners. Today this is Turkey, and tomorrow it could be China 
and the Arab countries. But the Russian-speaking population in 
Uzbekistan would be placed in a situation where they are cut off 
from Russia. This cannot be allowed, because 50 percent of the 
population in Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking, Uzbekistan--20 
percent, Tajikistan--30 percent, and Kyrgyzstan--40 percent. If 
all these people wanted to leave Central Asia for Russia, 
imagine how much money it would take. 
  [Polupanov] Anyway, how did you manage to legalize your 
capital (if this is not a trade secret, of course)? 
  [Usmanov] In 1987 I was one of the first people in 
Uzbekistan 
to open up my own cooperative, Mechta, after borrowing 500 
rubles from my neighbor to invest in the authorized charter 
capital. During the first year we received 18,000 in profit, and 
the next year--200,000. Then, when our bureaucratic apparatus 
began a mass attack on the cooperatives, I reorganized my 
enterprise into a kolkhoz. But still I was having constant 
conflicts with the banking system. I was forced to study the 
instructions of the State Bank much more deeply than bank 
employees do. At that time many of us were making money and 
going underground. But I spent all my money on the development 
of my own enterprise. Now I have more than 100 trucks, a whole 
fleet of passenger cars, and several plants for processing 
agricultural products. Therefore last year when the government 
suggested that I open a bank there was no problem about where to 
get the money. I put up all my property. The audit service came 
and inspected it. And that made up the bank's authorized charter 
capital. 
  Today I have an opportunity to help children's homes and 
homes for the elderly. And the main thing is that I create all 
the proper conditions for my workers to work. I read this 
sentence about myself in a magazine: "The capitalist Usmanov has 
created communism for his workers." There is a point in working 
for this.

"Municipal Elections Lie Ahead. Having Experienced Failure, the 
Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms Hopes for Success"] 
  [Text] After the shocking success of V. Zhirinovskiy's LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] in the last Federal 
Assembly elections and the more modest results obtained by the 
Russia's Choice bloc, the failure of the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms [RMDR] was the third sensation of the 
political campaign that ended on 12 December of last year. Why 
was it that the movement that was called, not without 
justification, the most intelligent in terms of composition 
among the 13 participants in the election marathon and which was 
regularly predicted to have a successful, albeit modest, result, 
was unable to pass the 5 percent mark? 
  An analysis of the situation forces one to look for reasons 
for the failure primarily in the fact that the RMDR does not 
have a clear-cut, simple, and comprehensible program of action 
for specific areas of the life of society. That is, of course, 
the basic objectives were declared and essentially they were and 
still are correct: tax reduction to benefit commodity producers, 
transfer of a large part of federal authority to the local 
areas, support of domestic exporters, a change in foreign 
political priorities in favor of nearby foreign countries, and 
so on. But all of these slogans were lacking clear paths to 
achieving them. Moreover, the majority of the blocs that 
participated in the election campaign formulated basically the 
same or similar objectives, and it was sometimes simply 
difficult for the voters to figure out the differences among 
them. And here the main point that distinguishes the RMDR from 
other election blocs and parties, mainly democratic ones, should 
play a role--this is the slogan of democratic opposition to the 
democratic government. During the course of the campaign the 
RMDR repeatedly stated that it was not lusting for power, that 
it did not aspire to participate in the government, that it 
wanted only, by obtaining a faction in the State Duma, to oppose 
the government of the democratic majority, to monitor and 
correct its actions if they shifted in the direction of the 
interests of the nomenklatura-bureaucratic minority. In and of 
itself, this task in any normal democratic society should have 
met with a certain amount of understanding, but under the 
conditions of Russia, during the course of the first multiparty 
elections, in the constant rush of this fast-moving campaign, to 
bring it to the minds of the voters, who were expecting simple 
and speedy solutions, turned out to be extremely difficult. And 
this is why to put forth a slogan of "democratic opposition" 
turned out to be, apparently, premature in this stage of history. 
  But in spite of all these objective and subjective factors 
affecting the outcome of the campaign as a whole, one of the 
essential causes of the failure of the RMDR, in my view, was 
that it made certain mistakes in conducting the mass media 
campaign, especially with television. First of all the failure 
of the RMDP occurred because they did not prepare short 
advertising films about the movement and show them in blocks of 
commercial advertising time on the leading television channels. 
For example, one could boldly state that the success of the 
PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and DPR [Democratic 
Party of Russia], whose ratings were equal to those of the RMDR 
but whose advertising films played continuously on television 
from morning until evening, was brought about precisely this 
factor. And the RMDR had only one advertising film, which was 
shown only during a time especially devoted to paid political 
advertising on television. But this turned out to be clearly 
inadequate. Here, in my view, part of the responsibility lies 
with the Central Electoral Commission, which formally banned the 
showing of political advertising on television at any time not 
especially allotted for it. 
  In addition to this essential fact, the results of the 
campaign were undoubtedly influenced by the late beginning of 
active work on the part of the RMDP in the mass media, which did 
not begin until practically 10 days before the elections. 
  Nonetheless, in spite of all the mistakes and blunders, the 
result achieved by the RMDR in the elections cannot be 
considered a defeat. With the movement receiving 4.1 percent of 
the votes, which means more than 2.1 million people, this is 
rather a lack of success, an incomplete project with a large 
potential for success in the next election campaign, which is 
not so far away. If one takes into account the fact that the 
RMDR received significant support in large cities and industrial 
regions such, for example, as Moscow (7.19 percent), St. 
Petersburg (8.79 percent), and Sverdlovsk (9.5 percent), 
Kemerovo (6.45 percent), Irkutsk (6.37 percent), and Chelyabinsk 
Oblasts (5.84 percent), Maritime Kray (5.62 percent), Omsk 
Oblast (5.78 percent), and so forth, one can see that the 
movement has developed a stable electorate, which consists 
mainly of members of the creative and scientific-technical 
intelligentsia, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers. The results 
of the elections show that of the 87 regions of Russia that 
participated in the elections, the RMDR received more than 5 
percent of the votes of those who voted in 16 regions; in 21 
regions it garnered from 4 to 5 percent of the votes; in another 
24 regions--from 3 to 4 percent; in 20--from 2 to 3 percent; and 
in only seven rayons did it receive less than 2 percent. And not 
in a single rayon did the RMDR receive less than 1.5 percent of 
the votes. This is significant if one takes into account the 
fact that other blocs that did not pass the 5-percent mark 
frequently garnered only 0.5 percent of the votes in many 
districts. If one adds to this the victory in the single-mandate 
districts of the five independent candidates supported by the 
RMDR to the state Duma and two to the federation council, one 
can speak with complete confidence about the relative success of 
the RMDR in this campaign, in spite of its failure to pass the 5 
percent mark. To sum up the positive aspects of the recent 
campaign, the RMDR was able to test and "break in" its apparatus 
and its 41 regional centers, which can now apply the experience 
accumulated in March 1994 in the elections to the local organs 
of power, and then the federal elections. The movement has 
acquired and tested an invaluable personnel reserve, from which 
it can now draw candidates in future campaigns. These will be 
mainly candidates who have been "broken in" in single-mandate 
districts, who took second and third place there, and candidates 
from the list who participated actively in the recent campaign. 
There was also a selection of partners for the RMDR, and new 
ties were formed. The position of the outside critical observer 
can give the RMDR many more pluses than minuses in this 
situation. 
  The RMDR congress will convene on 29 January in Moscow. It 
will consider the results of the autumn election campaign of 
1993, and on the basis of the "lessons" learned it will develop 
the movement's strategy and tactics for the near and distant 
future. 
  In the political situation that has developed since 12 
December, a great deal of significance is being attached to the 
question of developing a new, third path for Russia, since 
neither the platforms of the pro-government blocs nor the 
platforms of the opposition received the necessary support from 
the voters, and they cannot solve Russia's problems. If one 
takes into account the fact that 50 million Russians did not 
come to these elections, one can say with confidence that they 
are the ones who will decide the outcome of the next elections. 
Whoever can offer them an alternative path to democratic reforms 
that does not entail mass unemployment and bankruptcy, 
devaluation of investments and hyperinflation, and disregard for 
problems of preserving Russia's scientific potential and her 
culture, these are the ones who will gain support in the next 
elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Indira Dunayeva, under the "Party Movement" </F>
rubric: "Economic Freedom Party Congress Held. Borovoy and 
Comrades Keep Secrets"] 
  [Text] The Economic Freedom Party [PES] yesterday held a 
congress at which it evaluated the results of party activity, 
above all its participation in the parliamentary elections. 
Journalists were not allowed to attend the congress, but, as an 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told the day before the 
congress, changes in party leadership were to be made there: 
Instead of Konstantin Borovoy, its cochairmen would be Arkadiy 
Ankovskiy (Novosibirsk), Leonid Nekrasov (Yekaterinburg), and 
Oleg Tarasenko (Lipetsk). The party's general secretary (State 
Duma deputy Irina Khakamada) intended to become a cochairwoman 
with special status--the work of the general secretary involves 
material liability, and because of her status as a deputy, 
Khakamada cannot perform it. Ms. Khakamada, who was elected to 
the Duma as an independent deputy, thinks that she should have 
full independence as party cochairwoman. 
  As Irina Khakamada told a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, 
"Konstantin Borovoy at the congress declared the need for stiff 
opposition to the president and the government, but I, as an 
independent candidate, am interested in constructive dialogue 
and not political squabbling." Khakamada stated that while 
working in parliament she would maintain close contacts with 
regional divisions of the PES and lobby for draft laws needed by 
Russian entrepreneurs, but she would have nothing to do with the 
political statements of the party leadership. In her opinion, 
the party must work more with regional divisions and not get 
involved with the individual declarations of its leader. 
  The Yekaterinburg division of PES issued a statement in 
which 
responsibility for the party's loss in the parliamentary 
elections was placed largely on the party leadership.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Mitrofanov: "Patriots Dream of </F>
Becoming Europe's Policemen, but so Far They Specialize in 
Women's Purses"] 
  [Text] Chairman Dmitriy Rogozin apparently took the words 
cast from the podium of the Second World Congress of Russian 
Communities by participants in the patriotic gathering, "the 
time has come to act," too literally: The author of the 
television program "Compatriots," Lidiya Malash, had her purse, 
containing a dictaphone and documents, stolen during an 
interview with Cossack Captain Gruzinov. 
  But that, as they say, is small stuff. Having proclaimed 
that 
"a person who is not a part of the Russian community is not a 
Russian," nationalists from all regions of the former USSR 
agreed on the creation of a political organization that is 
"Russian in spirit and in deed." It will bring to power a 
"Russian government" which, as Rogozin stated, will not 
recognize "as full-fledged state borders" those borders with 
neighboring states that have now become independent--the "zone 
of vital interests" of Russia. The distant geopolitical future 
was sketched by the representative of an offshoot of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] (Zhirinovskiy was too 
liberal), the legal radical party: The Russian people in 
alliance with those same Aryan people, the Germans, are destined 
to become the "policemen of Europe." 
  The "new right," as they call themselves, when they come to 
power will deny Russian citizenship to all who have "pursued an 
anti-Russian policy." Above all, as was revealed at the 
congress, citizenship will be denied to members of the country's 
current leadership. Perhaps for the first time the solid Hall of 
Columns in the House of Unions resounded with whistles and 
catcalls. That is how the patriots greeted the appearance at the 
podium of the deputy minister of nationalities and regional 
policy, who read an invitation for cooperation sent by Sergey 
Shakhray and a representative of the Ministry of Defense. 
  While in the corridors of the House of Unions, where the 
congress took place, there was a whole sea of anti-Jewish 
printed products, in the Hall of Columns itself there were calls 
to learn to survive precisely from the Jewish people. Russians, 
in the words of the deputy editor of NASH SOVREMENNIK, 
Kaznitsev, must also provide themselves with a ministry of 
reunification and wise men who "think about the fate of the 
nation." To fulfill the role of the latter, they suggested the 
writer Rasputin and the mathematician Shafarevich (Solzhenitsyn 
was rejected). 
  But, as a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent managed to 
establish, the community members hold somebody altogether 
different in highest esteem. The merchant selling photographic 
portraits of numerous opposition leaders who had set up in the 
foyer of the House of Unions sold the most portraits--for 130 
rubles each--of the leader of the Russian Nazis, who is now 
being held under guard, Aleksandr Barkashov.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Anin, under the "Carte Blanche" </F>
rubric: "The Lubyanka Reform as an Iceberg. One Must Guess at 
What One Cannot See"] 
  [Text] The current reform of the Russian special services 
is proceeding with indirect support from the CIA, within the 
framework of the "Freedom Support Project," with its center in 
Langley and a branch in Moscow. Certain state security officers 
are convinced that Lubyanka is already operating under political 
control from the West. Here they refer to information from 
agency sources--their own and the Foreign Intelligence Service. 
  In principle, this is no sensation at all, because one of 
the 
mandatory areas of special service activity is monitoring 
various of the enemy's functional units--by operational methods 
and through political lobbying. If one pays attention to the 
total "Atlantism" of the new Russian policy, the above 
assessment of the concrete situation can be accepted, at least 
as one version. 
  Boris Yeltsin's December edict on abolishing the Ministry of 
Security was a surprise to people working behind the granite 
walls of Lubyanka. They had expected something like this after 
the October events. They received reassurances from the Kremlin 
in November: Go ahead and work, nothing of the kind will happen. 
But that very edict came from the president on the heels of the 
election. At Lubyanka they were sure that there was a 
connection. I was told that it was suggested from above "by the 
powers that be and the media" that they support the campaign of 
Russia's Choice, which did not happen. We know the results of 
the voting on 12 December. Plus there was the quite 
understandable fear of the organized structure, which sometimes 
has too much information that is harmful to the regime, and in 
principle, if something were to happen, is capable of taking 
forceful actions. Plus there is the desire that follows from 
this to finally take the "dangerous" organization in hand, right 
down to the point of creating a new system in a new place. 
  In any state, the special services operate within the 
framework of the concept of national security. By and large, 
there is no such thing in modern Russia. Therefore, Lubyanka is 
still operating with a view to basically the priorities and 
experience of past times. Which sometimes stands in 
contradiction to the strategic and, shall we say, local 
interests of the new powers. I was told that when Anatoliy 
Chubays came to Lubyanka, he rebuked the officers of the 
Ministry of Security for the fact that he had received from them 
nothing but negative developments pertaining to privatization. 
And these developments illustrate the extreme criminalization of 
a process; they are above all corruption and entanglement of 
Chubays' favorite brainchild by the Mafia structures. The chief 
of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property 
asked why he does not receive good news from the privatization 
front. He was given to understand that publicizing positive 
experience was the work of a different organization. Chubays was 
dissatisfied with this answer. 
  Only the deaf are not talking about corruption at all levels 
of Russian power today. And also about the Russian economy as 
the nutritive environment for economic banditry. The career 
interests of at least three administrations and one department 
of the disbanded Ministry of Security were concentrated 
precisely here. And almost 90 percent of the cases of the 
Ministry of Security of Russia involved corruption and organized 
crime. It was these three administrations--economic 
counterintelligence, transportation control, and the fight 
against contraband and corruption--that were separated from the 
general structure and transformed into two independent 
departments. The investigatory department was turned over to the 
procuracy. The Lefortovo Prison went to the militia. Just for 
good measure, the border troops were taken away from Lubyanka 
and also the operational-mobilization administration, which is 
in charge of the system of secret underground structures and 
utilities. 
  By taking direct charge of special services, the president 
precluded the very possibility of their being controlled by the 
government, parliament, or public organizations. Thus, 
counterintelligence was again transformed into a completely 
secret structure completely under the control of the "party in 
power." 
  When the president said that there would be no political 
detective work in Russia, he might as well have said that snow 
would not fall in Russia. Political detective work always has 
and always will exist in any state in the form of certain agency 
measures. This is necessary, to put it crudely, to reveal people 
or groups that intend to cause one or another kind of harm to 
the political regime or one of its representatives. It is boring 
to talk about this, it is primary. And no matter what Yeltsin 
may say, among the population this will be done by the same 
people who have always done it, only under a new name, and 
political detective work at the highest level will be done by a 
new structure, one might say, under the president himself. 
  Aleksandr Korzhakov is called Yeltsin's shadow. Yeltsin 
brought him along with him from back in Sverdlovsk, and he has 
been in charge of the group of the president's personal guard 
since the times when the current Russian leader was riding in a 
Moskvich. Since that time, if something has kept Korzhakov from 
gaining more power, it has been the need to interact in his work 
with the Kremlin guard, headed by the chief of Alpha, General 
Barsukov. On 3 October, after Alpha refused to storm the White 
House, Boris Yeltsin resolutely pushed Barsukov away, and now 
the president's personal guard is completely in Korzhakov's 
hands. One can judge the staff of the structure they created 
from the fact that, as we have learned from informed people, the 
staff distribution table includes several general slots. 
Moreover, as other sources assert, the new formation will have 
control of the main secret telephone communication lines--ATS-1, 
ATS-2, and operational communications. 
  All this plus the fact that in a presidential republic, 
which 
the post-October Russia intends to become, the actual power is 
the president and the president's circle, means that an 
extremely important task has been assigned to Aleksandr 
Korzhakov--to defend the presidential power. This is a new 
structure in a new place, which, in addition to guarding the 
president's actual body, will engage, it seems, in serious 
counterintelligence activity at the highest level, namely: 
political detective work along the line of 
parliament-party-government-Yeltsin's inner circle.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Ostapchuk, under the "Law" rubric: "The </F>
Constitutional Court Has Carried Out the President's 
Instructions. Chairman's Authority Limited in Draft Law"] 
  [Text] The draft law on the Constitutional Court of the 
Russian Federation prepared by the Constitutional Court Work 
Group was presented yesterday. Now it should soon be submitted 
to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly as a legislative 
initiative of the Constitutional Court. As we know, the 
president suggested that the court engage in legislative 
activity back in October of last year, when he issued the edict 
concerning the way for the constitutional judges to spend their 
time that would be preferable from his viewpoint. 
  Without going into the propriety of such "instructions" from 
the head of one branch of power to the highest organ of another, 
it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court really is in 
need of a new law. The previous one became obsolete because of 
the numerous amendments made to the previous Constitution. After 
the adoption of the new one, which gives completely different 
kinds of authority to the Constitutional Court, it became twice 
as obsolete. And that is only from the formal standpoint. 
  The law on the Constitutional Court, as distinct from many 
other laws of the new Russian state which have prototypes in 
Union practice, was written completely starting from "scratch." 
Such a reality as this simply did not exist previously. The 
authors from the Committee on Draft Legislation of the Supreme 
Soviet created a "cocktail" mainly out of American and German 
legal norms. Over two years, all of its weak spots "came to 
light." As for the new document, above all one should point out 
that it will be a federal constitutional law, with respect to 
which the Constitution has prescribed much stricter rules for 
adoption. It is a law that elaborates on the Constitution and 
fills in its gaps without a procedure for amendment. There will 
be only a couple of laws like this. 
  Consideration of the constitutionality of political parties 
has been eliminated from the new law. Therefore, one can assume 
that the so-called CPSU affair will remain the only precedent. 
And now every citizen or court may appeal a law that encroaches 
on the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens. 
  Resolving disputes between federal organs of power and 
subjects and among various subjects has also been added to the 
purview of the Constitutional Court. This new norm for the 
purview of the Constitutional Court is mentioned briefly in the 
new Constitution, but the law on the Constitutional Court 
includes the entire procedure. According to it, conflicting 
parties may appeal to the Court, as can the president if he has 
not succeeded in his conciliatory role in conflicts of powers. 
The fact that the Court has been given a completely new right to 
interpret the Constitution is also an innovation. 
  As for the chairman of the Supreme Court, his authority is 
significantly restricted now. His role has actually been reduced 
to conducting sessions and recognizing speakers. Any action on 
the part of the chairman is accompanied by a stipulation: "by a 
decision of the Court" "with the Court's consent," etc. All 
decisions are adopted collegially, which can also lead to making 
the Court ineffective if the judges, instead of analyzing cases, 
jointly resolve all issues, right down to economic ones. 
  The developers also tried to envision a number of measures 
to 
make politicization of the Court as difficult as possible. In 
many judicial systems there is such a concept as "restraint" or 
"silence" of judges. But that is not so much written into the 
laws as it is prescribed by ethics. Since no kind of silence can 
be achieved legislatively. Under the previous Russian law, 
judges were instructed not to discuss cases under consideration 
by the court while in the new one they are prohibited from 
expressing their ideas even regarding those issues that could be 
considered by the Court. 
  From now on, the results of the voting will not be divulged, 
either: how many voted "for" and how many "against" the decision 
that was adopted. Moreover, the judge is now prohibited not only 
from engaging in political activity but even from attending 
party congresses as a spectator. This prohibition seems rather 
absurd. One might assume that it was introduced specifically 
against Constitutional Court Judge Viktor Luchin, on whom, in 
search of "evidence" of his political activity, the judges 
subscribing to a pro-presidential political direction "pinned" 
precisely that. 
  The law on the Constitutional Court also contains many other 
"innovations" whose apparent purpose is to reduce the political 
role of the Constitutional Court as much as possible. As we 
know, the Court began to consider the president's statements of 
both 20 March and 21 September on its own initiative. The Court 
has now been deprived of the right to such personal initiative. 
Incidentally, another ban has been imposed: The Constitutional 
Court may not consider actions and decisions of officials that 
are not expressed in normative acts (another veiled reference to 
20 March of last year). 
  In order to accelerate the movement of cases, the Court has 
been divided into two chambers, which have equal rights and are 
not specialized. No position for chairman has been envisioned in 
the chambers. 
  In addition to these innovations, an extremely important 
aspect, which was initially proposed by specialists from the 
work group but was eliminated in the stage of coordination, is 
missing. This measure could prevent extremely negative political 
consequences of the adoption of unconstitutional laws. We are 
speaking about preliminary monitoring of laws published by 
parliament. In the opinion of the leader of the Department of 
International Law of the Constitutional Court, Vadim Sobakin, 
"If the Court were given the right to verify the 
constitutionality of laws after they were adopted but before 
they were published, this would help to significantly reduce the 
intensity of political passions. For after the law takes effect, 
irreversible consequences begin. For example, the law on taxes. 
Let us say that it encroaches on citizens' rights. But how many 
people have to pay the taxes it establishes before we consider 
their constitutionality! And it is precisely the honest 
taxpayers who suffer. This would also mean that the president 
would not have to be discredited again--after all, when a law is 
abolished, his okay goes with it. This practice is widespread in 
many European countries whose Constitutional Court proceedings 
are extremely similar to ours. Such as Italy, Austria, Romania, 
Poland, Portugal, and other countries."

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov under the rubric "Elections": "What </F>
Jupiter May, the Bull May Not?"] 
  [Text] The process of elections to the bodies of 
representative power of Russian Federation components has been 
put in motion by presidential edicts since December of last 
year. But the peak of the elections will occur in March. The 
main political forces are actively preparing for them: Some 
count on reinforcing the success achieved at the federal level, 
others--on retribution for the loss. 
  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov already anticipates 
victory at the local level: "I have no doubt that leftist forces 
will come into power if the elections are honest." The PRES 
[Russian Party of Unity and Accord] emphasizes in yet another 
statement: "The party's next step is to form bodies of authority 
in Federation components." Russia's Choice will time the 
creation of its new party to the March election campaign. 
  According to the Constitution, definition of the basic 
principles of forming bodies of authority in Russian Federation 
components is the subject of joint jurisdiction of the Russian 
Federation and its components. But until a federal law is 
adopted, the president has entrusted this business to 
administration heads. The list of violations of voters' rights 
that are taking place in the process is not limited to the 
example of St. Petersburg, where by decision of the city's 
mayor, 100,000 residents have been deprived of the right to 
vote. It also includes liberties in "mapping" electoral 
districts, and candidates' unequal access to the mass media; 
requiring permission for a candidate to register instead of a 
mere declaration of intent; the imposition of 
one--majority-based--electoral system; and so on. 
  Mostly importantly, the prospect of turning the system of 
representative organs from an intended counterbalance to the 
executive branch into an appendix of it is coming through 
increasingly clearly. There are countless instances of infusion 
of various level staff members of administrations into kray, 
oblast, and other assemblies. In Stavropol Kray, the head of 
administration repealed the decision of the kray's inner council 
on the 42-member composition of the duma; now the duma will have 
only 25 members, of which 15 are heads of local administrations. 
The Saratov Oblast Assembly promises to have the same 
qualitative composition. In Tula, of 24 duma members, six may be 
"appointed" by the head of the administration. 
  Last week the Russian State Duma took this issue to heart. 
But the Duma attempt to interfere in the process that is well 
underway became complicated by internal struggle in the chamber 
itself. Sometimes it resembled an entertaining game of 
intercepting the ball from the adversary, occasionally reaching 
the point of pushing him outside the "playing field." 
  The question of local elections was put on the Duma agenda 
at 
the initiative of Oleg Mironov, a deputy from the Communist 
Party and member of the Legislation Committee, which is headed 
by the "Agrarian" Vladimir Isakov. The Communists and the 
Agrarian Party factions prepared a draft Duma decree "On General 
Principles of Organizing the System of Bodies of State Authority 
and Local Self-Government." However, the Committees for 
Federation Affairs and Local Self-Government Issues, headed by 
PRES members Sergey Shapovalov and Anatoliy Sliva, immediately 
countered it with their own joint draft. Isakov's committee 
attempted to have itself included among the coauthors of this 
second draft, but PRES-ites refused to accept him into their 
company. On 8 February they organized a separate meeting and 
invited to it representatives of the Central Electoral 
Commission [CEC] and of the president's and government's sides. 
The position of both the Duma politicians and representatives of 
the executive branch revolved around the dilemma of whether to 
treat the situation regarding local elections as a gross, fatal 
violation (elections do not reveal the true expression of the 
citizens' will) or as a deviation that can still be fixed? And, 
accordingly, should elections be postponed until a federal law 
is adopted, thus throwing doubt on the president's edicts, or 
give the president and the Central Electoral Commission an 
opportunity to make some corrections? 
  Yuriy Yakovlev, deputy from the Democratic Party of Russia 
[DPR], expressing the extreme point of view, characterized the 
processes at the local level as across-the-board "prohibition of 
political activities" and urged not only that the elections be 
postponed but also that those that have already taken place be 
recognized as invalid. The initial draft of the Communists and 
Agrarians, by the way, also assumed the suspension of elections 
and a declaration that the president's edicts are "no longer in 
force." The leaders of the DPR and LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia], Nikolay Travkin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
also urged postponing the elections until the fall. The joint 
draft of two committees--Shapovalov's and Sliva's--on the 
contrary, recommended that the president take steps toward 
eliminating violations of citizens' rights, and that the CEC, 
the general procurator, and Russian Federation component 
executive branches bring the components' legislation into accord 
with the Constitution. 
  On Wednesday this issue was discussed at a plenary session 
of 
the Duma. Three documents had been put forward by then, and were 
put to a vote; none passed. 
  It would probably be a simplification to see in the Duma's 
clashes only a manifestation of the chronic confrontation 
between democrats and conservatives. The same Yuriy Yakovlev 
believes that in the question of local elections "all parties 
have huddled together; the struggle is not between the 
parties--it is a struggle of all parties against the 
arbitrariness of the administration." This is close to the 
truth. At a time when the "Communist-Agrarian" Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin prefers not to aggravate the relationship with the 
president and to follow the "planned course," Democrat Shakhray, 
for instance, calls for moving the elections to June. 
  On the part of the executive structures, it was delicately 
suggested that the Duma "not stick its head out." CEC Deputy 
Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko promised the deputies that his 
agency "will keep the electoral process under control." Not too 
many in the Duma were elated over this, since Mr. Ryabov's 
agency is treated here with great suspicion. Viktor Sheynis 
believes that the CEC de facto acts as a "ministry of electoral 
affairs," whose directives are accepted on the local level as a 
guidance for action. 
  An original interpretation of the situation with the 
elections and the Duma's approaches to it came from Nikolay 
Medvedev, chief of the presidential administration's department 
for work with the territories. First, he said frankly: "We 
currently have to do everything we can to make at least one 
branch of authority stable--namely, the executive." Second, 
having characterized the Duma's interest in local elections as a 
"contradiction between the bodies of state power of the Russian 
Federation components and the State Duma," he seriously alarmed 
Duma members. 
  It is obvious that the presidential side now has a chance to 
pitch the Duma against the regions by interpreting its actions 
on the issue of local elections as aimed simultaneously against 
both the Kremlin and the "provincial generals." In this instance 
the Duma is also being "squeezed from above" by the Federation 
Council, which to a considerable extent consists of precisely 
these "generals" and may veto a decision on suspension of 
elections. 
  One can understand the provincial bosses, by the way. If it 
was possible to fill half of one chamber with heads and 
officials of various administrations, and elect deputy prime 
ministers and ministers into the other, why should oblast and 
kray "parliaments" not do the same? After all, the provinces 
learn democracy and parliamentarism from Moscow--there is no 
other source.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tuykov, Sverdlovsk Oblast procurator, </F>
honored jurist of the Russian Federation: "Nowhere Are There So 
Many Laws and So Much Lawlessness as in Russia"] 
  [Text] "Privatization." This word is all we hear. And 
it is no wonder, since the state property is being divided up, 
and this is being done with a purely Russian sweep. According to 
the statement of Anatoliy Chubays, a miracle has occurred: 
"Privatization in Russia has come to pass!" 
  But now let us take a closer look at miracles. When the 
question of the results of procurator's investigations into 
implementation of legislation on privatization of state and 
municipal property was being discussed at the meeting of the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast procurator's office governing board, the 
following question was asked, among others: "Is there even one 
object which has been privatized correctly?" 
  Of course there is. By its rate of privatization, Sverdlovsk 
Oblast is one of the leaders in the country. Contracts of 
purchase and sale have been concluded for 2,650 facilities, for 
a sum of 9 billion rubles (R). A particular onslaught was noted 
in the sphere of services: Around 75 percent of the facilities 
in trade, public catering and consumer services passed over to 
private ownership. 
  But, alas, these tempos and accelerations, these leaps and 
shocks! Is the state not selling itself off too hastily and 
generously, sometimes to the point of incredibility? That is 
banal, you say, we are tired of it. I agree. Yet the facts 
remain... 
  Let us take, for example, the supermarket "Kirovskiy" which 
is known to all in Yekaterinburg. By law, it must be auctioned 
off in such a way that the state will retain its share. However, 
it turns out that it was sold to individuals--founders of the 
closed joint-stock company "Yunezis"--for a mere R10 million. A 
gigantic store--for the price of a one-room apartment. Moreover, 
the owners have up until the year 1996 to pay 90 percent of this 
sum. 
  The management of the former production association (today 
the joint-stock company) "Uralmash" has handed over the former 
state store to the limited partnership "Orion" for R126,000. 
Moreover, by decision of the oblast committee on administration 
of state property, the laboratory unit of the Central 
Scientific-Research Institute of Metallurgy and Materials was 
simply given over to the balance sheet of the private firm 
"MKM-Standart." In this case, the value of the property, 
according to the certificate of transfer, comprised R1,836,000, 
although the actual figure is somewhat different--R31,347,000. 
These are truly czar's gifts. 
  Such examples are not singular. Perhaps we could write them 
off to the shortcomings of the now former State Program of 
Privatization for 1992, which existed only until the end of last 
year. It was this program which set the so-called "accounting 
indicators for privatization of state and municipal enterprises 
for 1992 for the krays and oblasts." But to put it simply, the 
percentages on what and how much must be sold to private hands 
in one region or another were handed down from above. Moreover, 
it was reported that these indicators were "minimal." 
  For example, the "plan" obligated Sverdlovsk Oblast to 
privatization only in the light and food industry, construction, 
retail and wholesale trade, public catering and consumer 
services, comprising from 45 to 60 percent of all enterprises. 
Thus, the fervor of some local bureaucrats stems from the 
authors of the now defunct program. 
  It was primarily small enterprises, and more rarely 
medium-sized ones, which fell under these percentages. Yet the 
large ones which occupied a dominant position at the federal or 
local levels (and there are also many of these in our oblast) 
were permitted to privatize only by decision of the government 
or the Goskomimushchesto [State Committee on Administration of 
Property] of Russia. 
  And so finally, on 24 December 1993, the new State Program 
for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the 
Russian Federation which had been presented by the government 
was ratified by edict of the Russian Federation President. As a 
man who in the recent past has had work experience in the 
supreme legislative agency of Russia, I am convinced that this 
program will evoke a non-synonymous evaluation among the Federal 
Assembly and will be one of the first rather debatable questions. 
  As is the rule, the next program organically stems from the 
preceding one and at the same time contains much that is new. We 
would like to note two curious circumstances which lie, so to 
speak, on the surface. As before, accounting indicators are 
retained for the regions. However, while before they were 
directly secured in the program ratified by resolution of the 
Supreme Soviet and having the force of law, now these 
"guidelines" will be handed down to the agencies of state power 
of the republics within the make-up of the Russian Federation, 
the krays and oblasts by the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, and 
moreover with increasing totals. 
  That is the way it is. And there is no need to argue. Read 
the program, and you will understand why. With the consent of 
the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, additional methods of 
privatization may be used, but only by those regions which, and 
we quote, "have reached the highest indicators in implementing 
privatization" and have been included in a special list ratified 
by the government of Russia. 
  And since they have made it to this list, they have the 
right 
to independently make decisions on privatization of those very 
same large, dominant, all-federal and similar (with certain 
exceptions) facilities without obtaining any permission from the 
government of Russia. 
  And so, there are the tempos for you! So it is better not to 
be indignant, but to get to down to business. And not to forget 
that "allocation of financial resources to regions is performed 
with consideration of their fulfillment of the State Program of 
Privatization." 
  Skeptics will say: "There will not be enough money to buy 
such enterprises." And again they will be wrong. The program has 
one other peculiarity in this regard: While before the personal 
savings of citizens, privatization checks, private as well as 
loaned funds of legal persons were listed as sources of funds 
for acquisition of state facilities, today those who have no 
money can take personal credit in any commercial or, if you 
like, foreign bank. So hurry to get in line at the banks. Who 
knows, you may become a large-scale property owner... 
  Of course, we cannot do without shortcomings. And the most 
unpleasant of these are violations of the laws. According to the 
effective legislation, the right to appeal to a court of 
arbitration is granted to practically any organizations, 
entrepreneurs, or simply to individuals. 
  Here they have once again "forgotten" about the procurator. 
We are referring to the procurator of a city or rayon who can 
appeal to a court of arbitration in defense of state and public 
interests only through the oblast procurator. Although it is 
clear that this will require additional time and, as a result, 
the efficiency of reacting to violations of the laws will be 
lost. The oblast procurators, in turn, cannot independently 
protest the decision of the arbitration court. They must appeal 
to the Procurator General's office for this. 
  This question was raised repeatedly at different levels, but 
without result. Moreover, we know that most of the legal 
violations occur specifically in the local areas. This is 
evidenced also by the procurator's investigations. 
  Unfortunately, it has become a customary situation for 
private owners not to keep the enterprise which they have 
purchased, despite the conditions of privatization. In one of 
the largest rayons of Yekaterinburg, with its million-and-a-half 
population, there is practically not a single operating barber 
shop, and specialized bakery and dairy stores are violating the 
conditions of their agreements. 
  There is no sense in listing all the destruction which has 
been permitted, due largely to the ambiguity, confusion and 
contradictory nature of the laws, as well as the personal 
irresponsibility and professional incompetence of the people 
"making" privatization. It is true what they say: Nowhere are 
there so many laws and so much lawlessness as in Russia. 
  The new Constitution of Russia states that all types of 
ownership, including also state property, is equally protected 
by law. But by which one? By the antiquated criminal code, which 
has long been in need of radical changes? Or perhaps by the 
effective law, "On Property in the RSFSR," which merely 
declared, and nothing more, that the loss inflicted upon an 
owner by a crime is to be compensated by the state? 
  The new state program will undoubtedly stimulate the process 
of privatization and give it greater scope.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev, president of </F>
the Sakha Republic, conducted by Robert Serebrennikov: "Mikhail 
Nikolayev, President of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) and Federal 
Assembly Deputy, Is VOSTOCHNYY EKSPRESS' Guest"] 
  [Text] [Serebrennikov] Mikhail Yefimovich, what has the 
past year meant for your republic? 
  [Nikolayev] The main goal we set was to prevent a decline in 
production. Today the republic's budget is balanced -- as we 
earn, so we will also live. I can say with confidence that power 
production, the diamond industry, gold mining and the coal 
industry will achieve their proper levels. 
  We are shifting our economy to a market-based system, but in 
the Far North there are some industries and individual 
enterprises that are unprofitable for the republic. For example, 
a combine that mines and manufactures tin concentrates in the 
Arctic. Its annual output as measured in current prices 
established by the government of the Russian Federation is 
around R12 billion [rubles]. Yet our expenditures for it are 
R50-60 billion! We would shut the combine down as unsuited to a 
market economy, but we must also consider Russia's interests. 
  Also, we mine approximately 14 million tonnes of anthracite 
coal, yet we consume only 4 million. We export the rest. And the 
more coal we mine, the more money we lose! Worse yet, our 
customers -- Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk and Maritime krays and 
Chelyabinsk -- are not paying for the shipments they receive. So 
we have to make up for the shortfalls out of our meager budget. 
  Additionally, there are also strategic issues. For example, 
construction of a railroad. We would have to build it and equip 
it at our own expense. But it is Russia that really needs the 
railroad! 
  We have a great many problems. If they are not solved that 
will be bad for Russia. It is time for us to move away from 
political games and toward practical action. Else it will only 
be words when we talk about "reviving Russia" or a "great 
Russia." I hope that beginning in 1994 our parliament will begin 
working for the good of all citizens. 
  [Serebrennikov] How is the situation with regard to 
attracting foreign investment to your republic? 
  [Nikolayev] The Sakha Republic currently has economic ties 
with 22 countries around the world, and approximately 30 joint 
ventures with foreign companies have been established. We intend 
to update equipment in the coal, diamond, food and local 
industries and in the river transportation system. 
  However, by establishing joint ventures to solve some of our 
problems we divide the profits with foreign companies, i.e. we 
create jobs in their countries. In my opinion this problem 
should be resolved with the help of Russia's lines of credit, by 
creating and expanding internal debt. That way we could take our 
larger loans, using a large mineral deposit as collateral, using 
our gold, of which we have more than enough untapped reserves. 
Then we would pay back that loan in 5-10 years. 
  [Serebrennikov] When people talk about Yakutia they never 
fail to mention its diamonds... 
  [Nikolayev] In 1993 our republic's diamond industry met its 
plan goals in every regard, both financially and in terms of 
output. 
  Shifting that industry to market-based structures has been 
one of the main achievements of the past year. We have 
established a joint-stock company called Almazy Rossii-Sakha, 
which hold the reins to the mining, sorting, storage and sale of 
diamonds and the production of gem-quality stones. This very 
large diamond company, which is without parallel either in 
Russia or anywhere else in the world, ended its first year of 
operations with a profit. 
  Right now the issue is not how to increase diamond 
production, but rather how many diamonds we can sell. Therefore 
we follow this rule: we will only mine as many diamonds as we 
can sell. 
  Last year six stonecutting plants opened in the republic. 
There are plans to start up another eight diamond-cutting 
enterprises in 1994. They will employ approximately 2,000 
diamond cutters. 
  It is our hope that in 1994 the Russian Federation will open 
a diamond exchange, the first in our country and only the fourth 
in the world. Why should we export our diamonds and sell them in 
London or Belgium? Let foreign buyers come to us! 
  We need a real market for the sale of gem-quality diamonds. 
Incidentally, the first auction of gem-quality diamonds was held 
in Yakutsk in late December. 
  I should add that the well-known agreement between Russia 
and 
the South African firm De Beers is being complied with 100 
percent, and that the other side has had no complaints. 
  As for diamond deposits in Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Almazy 
Rossii-Sakha Company is prepared to help develop them on a 
shareholder basis, depending on the volume of diamonds to be 
mined. 
  [Serebrennikov] What is your view of your republic's future? 
  [Nikolayev] We have many problems, but the work is 
interesting. The most important thing is that no one hold us 
back. Right now it is not inflation that bothers us, but instead 
mutual payments and the confiscatory tax and lending policy 
(with interest rates for loans of up to 400 percent!). The Far 
North cannot go on like this: we need government protectionism 
and a favorable lending and tax policy. 
  We are currently considering establishing an International 
Bank for the Reconstruction and Development of the Arctic, of 
which we would like to be the founders. We also intend to work 
on establishing an academy to study the Arctic. And much is 
being done toward social protection for our people. 
  Despite the difficult times we live in, our republic remains 
peaceful and calm. And that, I am sure you will agree, is no 
small accomplishment.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Serebrennikov: "Do Our Country's Gold </F>
Miners Intend To Collaborate With Foreign Investors? They Do, 
but..." 
  [Text] Foreign investors' interest in Russian gold is 
obvious. Gold is mined in the Urals, the Far East, a number of 
regions in Western and Eastern Siberia, on Kamchatka and in 
Chukotka. A total of 146 tonnes of gold were mined in 1992, 
which means that the Russian Federation accounts for 
approximately 10 percent of world gold production. Russia's 
known gold deposits total approximately 12,000 tonnes. 
  According to a state program for the development of the 
Russian Federation's mineral and raw materials infrastructure 
and its geological service in the 1993-95 period and up to the 
year 2000, a program now under discussion by the government, 
Russia is currently supplied with enough known reserves of 
placer gold to last 12 years and enough ore gold to last 30 
years. 
  In 1990 the Glavalmazzoloto [Main Administration for the 
Diamond and Gold Industry] Institute did a large-scale study 
that made it possible to project the volume of gold production 
in Russia and contained a model of the world precious metals 
market through the 2005-2010 period. The Russian gold mining 
industry's problems are inadequate equipment and a lack of 
funding to prospect for new gold deposits. 
  The Russian Federation's admission to the World Monetary 
Fund 
and declassification of information about Russia's gold have 
given foreign companies a real chance to participate in gold 
mining. Representatives of various companies in Canada, the 
United States, Australia, France and South Africa have already 
visited virtually every Russian gold field and familiarized 
themselves with their mining and refining equipment and 
technology and with their labor organization. 
  In principle, the leadership of the Russian Almazzoloto 
Corporation Joint-Stock Company and the Russian Prospecting 
Cooperatives Union are in favor of attracting foreign investment 
and participation by foreign companies both in the development 
of new gold fields and in the modernization of existing ones. In 
their opinion Russia already has all the necessary laws and 
legal statutes for that kind of cooperation. 
  It is interesting to note that their positions differ on the 
issue of foreign investment. For instance, whereas Almazzoloto 
vice-president Ivan Alekseyev is in favor of having foreign 
companies involved both in the development of new fields and the 
modernization of existing ones, Viktor Tarakanovskiy, chairman 
of the Prospecting Cooperatives Union council, favors foreign 
participation, but only through the extension of loans, not 
establishment of joint ventures. We should note that Russian 
authorities are of the opinion that the best gold deposits 
should not be turned over to foreign companies for development. 
They should be developed solely by the Russian state and our 
country's own private capital. Prospectors' cooperatives have 
gone on record as saying that they themselves can increase gold 
production if the government will lower taxes, grant them the 
necessary licenses, give them the chance to carry on normal 
geological survey work and allow them to purchase leased 
property. 
  Foreign capital can only be used to develop ore gold 
reserves, which are not that numerous in Russia. Foreign 
investors are not likely to be interested in small placer 
deposits (with reserves of one tonne of gold or more). In 
addition, Russian ore gold deposits are difficult to work: they 
contain heavy concentrations of arsenic, mercury and antimony. 
  The leaders of Russia's gold mining industry feel that 
current Russian gold mining equipment is comparable to its best 
Western counterparts. What Russia needs now is a completely new, 
high-efficiency technology, which the West does not yet have. 
  Currently open to international tender (though other terms 
are possible) are a number of new gold fields in the Russian 
Federation, including Pokrovskoye (Amur Oblast), Khakandzha 
(Khabarovsk Kray), Mayskoye (Magadan Oblast) and Ametistovoye 
(Kamchatka Oblast). A tender involving foreign participation has 
also been made to develop a deposit at Kubaka (Magadan Oblast). 
  Foreign investors are not limited to a 30-percent share in 
net profits when engaged in gold mining. Authoritative 
structures dealing with gold mining in Russia have refuted 
published reports of any such restrictions, stressing that 
foreign partners can definitely count on a greater share than 
that. Much will depend on what any such cooperation would offer 
the gold mining industry and Russia as a whole. 
  As for foreign investors' concerns over the political 
situation in Russia, every business involves a certain element 
of risk. But one should bear in mind that no matter what the 
initial conditions, the winner among foreign investors will be 
the one who is the first, disregarding the risk, to become 
established in Russian gold mining. 
  However, when making the leap into Russian gold mining one 
should also consider the negative experience of the Australian 
corporation Star Technology Systems, which was interested in 
developing the Sukhoy Log field in Irkutsk Oblast, the largest 
gold deposit in Russia and one of the largest in the world. 
  Both publicly and privately leaders of the Almazzoloto 
Russian Corporation Joint-Stock Company have levelled harsh 
criticism at that first attempt at large-scale attraction of 
foreign investment in Russian gold mining. The problem was that 
the Star corporation established the Lenzoloto-Star Joint 
Venture through a contract with the oblast state property 
committee, which did not possess the proper authority or 
authorization to do so. 
  By doing so the Australian company was granted the right to 
develop not only previously surveyed deposits, but also any that 
might be discovered at Sukhoy Log in the future. Furthermore, it 
was agreed that gold prospectors' cooperatives would operate 
solely on the basis of agreements with the Lenzoloto-Star Joint 
Venture (thus far no licenses have been issued to prospectors). 
Plus, as was later revealed, the Star corporation did not have 
the necessary status or reputation in the gold mining industry 
or the requisite financial resources, nor did it have anything 
new to offer Russia's gold mining industry. 
  Russian gold mining industry circles have accused the 
Australian corporation of bribing certain members of the local 
administration in Irkutsk Oblast. The press has latched onto the 
scandal. All these factors have delayed development of gold ore 
deposits at Sukhoy Log by more than a year. 
  Foreign investors interested in mining gold in Russia should 
draw the following conclusion from the failure of Australia's 
Star corporation: matters involving access to the development of 
new gold fields cannot be resolved solely with the aid of 
regional governmental bodies. One must comply with all the 
formalities established by federal law in order to obtain a 
mining license. This "cavalry charge" by an Australian 
corporation expecting to gain mining rights solely through the 
support of certain local governmental bodies ended in failure. 
Russian gold mining industry circles regard that approach as 
ill-advised adventurism. 
  In conclusion it should be noted that gold mining in Russia 
is at present a low-profit industry. Largely responsible for 
this is "barbaric" (the term used by gold industry 
representatives) taxation, which takes 80 or even 90 percent (in 
Yakutia) of profits. 
  Yegor Gaydar said at a recent meeting with the heads of 
Almazzoloto and the Russian Prospecting Cooperatives Union that 
he deems it inappropriate to mine "gold that costs more than 
gold." In such cases, Gaydar stressed, it would be more 
advantageous for Russia to buy gold on the world market than to 
mine it at home. 
  However, an infusion of Western capital combined with terms 
favorable to both sides could significantly improve the 
profitability of the Russian gold mining industry.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Vladykina: "Huge Copper Deposit Discovered </F>
in the Urals: It Will Be Developed by the Russian-British Safmed 
Company"] 
  [Text] Yekaterinburg--The famous copper deposits in the 
middle Urals are practically depleted. The Novo-Yezhovskaya mine 
has been closed, and the end of mining at Degtyarskaya and 
Gumeshevskaya is not far away. True, there are promising 
deposits in the northern part of the Urals, but geological 
prospecting there has been suspended for lack of money. 
  Against this background, all the more unexpected is the 
opening of a new Safyanovskaya mine near the city of Rezh, where 
full-scale mining operations have already begun. It is envisaged 
that by the end of this year the first tonnes of minerals will 
be produced in the new mine. 
  Not too many people dare these days to begin development of 
new deposits. The Safmed AO [joint-stock company], among whose 
founders are the Rezh nickel plant and Krasnoyralskiy 
Copper-Smelting Combine, several St. Petersburg and Podolsk 
enterprises, and the British Mardima company, also have certain 
concerns in this regard. As is known, due to rising copper 
prices on the domestic market, exports are becoming 
unprofitable, while domestic demand at this point is 
insignificant. 
  The Safyanovskiy deposit, however, is one of the biggest. 
There are enough deposits of copper and zinc ore there to last 
50 years. The mine contains 1 million tonnes of copper alone. 
Although in terms of reserves the deposit is smaller than the 
famous Udokan, half of the ore can be strip-mined, and at some 
sections it is as close as 11 meters below the surface. Besides, 
the average content of copper in Safyanovsk ore is 3 percent, in 
places as high as 28 percent, although even 1 percent is 
considered normal. The deposit is located in an inhabited area 
with developed communications. In addition to copper it contains 
zinc, sulfur, gold, and silver. The Safmed AO is counting on 
delivering to the consumer up to 350,000 tonnes of copper-zinc 
ore in 1995. In time the Safyanovskiy pit may replace 
Degtyarskiy--the largest deposit, which has been depleted over a 
century of exploitation.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Filippov, IZVESTIYA: "Journalists Are </F>
Stripped of Even the Right To Own a Typewriter"] 
  [Text] It appears that the untiring fighters against 
freedom have invented another new noose for the press. 
  The Government of Russia in Decree No. 1308 has transferred 
27 federal enterprises and organizations to the ownership of 
Arkhangelsk Oblast. The list contains this line: "Editorial 
offices of the mass circulation oblast newspaper PRAVDA SEVERA." 
  "The way we read the government decree is that the subject 
of 
transfer is not the editorial collective but only the property 
this collective uses," explained Grigoriy Perfilov, chairman of 
the oblast committee for administration of state property. "The 
editorial offices are furnished with tables, chairs, bookcases, 
and typewriters, which belong to the state. The newspaper leases 
this property from the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration, or to 
be precise, from our committee. That is all." 
  An alarming detail: PRAVDA SEVERA is not a state-owned 
newspaper; it was founded by the newspaper's journalistic 
collective, and therefore the legitimacy of the government 
degree with respect to this newspaper is questionable. According 
to Grigoriy Perfilov, it was the oblast's publishing and 
printing administration that added the newspaper to the draft of 
this decree. PRAVDA SEVERA journalists name another "author": 
The petition to the government to transfer the newspaper to the 
oblast was signed by the former chairman of the former oblast 
soviet, Yuriy Guskov. 
  PRAVDA SEVERA Deputy Editor in Chief Aleksandr Sakharov 
emphasized that the oblast administration does not encroach on 
the newspaper's freedom of action and even provides material 
assistance to journalists of the independent publication. In 
particular, it made up for the losses on discounted 
subscriptions for low-income subscribers--an amount of more than 
68 million rubles. 
  On the other hand, with this government decree in effect, 
PRAVDA SEVERA could be kept in check even without interfering 
with the editorial personnel. The building where the newspaper 
is located is federal property, while the newspaper's equipment 
belongs to the oblast. Thus, the journalists found themselves 
completely dependent on a benevolent attitude of two masters 
simultaneously. Either of these masters, should they decide to 
hike the rent, could easily bankrupt the paper. So far, thank 
goodness, there is no indication of such an intent. But the 
noose has been put in place and for that reason is already 
dangerous for freedom of speech. It cannot be precluded that our 
bureaucrats, always active in fighting journalists, will 
replicate the "Arkhangelsk noose" with respect to all the 
regional publications and thus will be able to manipulate public 
opinion. Today the central newspapers, because of diminishing 
circulation, have little influence on public opinion in the 
provinces. The authority of local publications, on the other 
hand, had increased sharply. PRAVDA SEVERA has a circulation of 
more than 70,000: one copy per 20 oblast residents, including 
infants. 
  On the day I visited the PRAVDA SEVERA editorial offices 
they 
got a call from Moscow--from the judiciary chamber on 
information disputes, and from St. Petersburg--from the regional 
inspectorate on protection of freedom of the press. They 
promised all sorts of assistance if someone tries on the basis 
of the government decree to encroach on the newspaper's 
legitimate rights. This preventive alarm is understandable. 
Although the law is sacred in Russia, the lawmakers are foes.

  [Text] The process of transition to market relations 
continued in the economy of the Republic of Tatarstan during 
1993. New forms of management were created, entrepreneurship 
developed, and enterprises and organizations were privatized. 
  In industry there was no further deepening of the decline of 
production, and the output of foodstuffs increased. In 
agriculture the production of animal husbandry products grew 
steadily, and the productivity of livestock increased. 
  Implementation of the state program for targeted social 
protection of the population stabilized the standard of living. 
The growth rates of the monetary incomes of the population 
outstripped the growth of consumer prices. There was an increase 
in the consumption of certain basic food products. 
  But the economic reforms are proceeding with difficulty. The 
crisis of mutual nonpayments has become more severe. Some 
productions have shut down. The production volume has decreased 
in many branches of industry except for flour-cereal and 
manufactured concentrated feeds, printing, forestry, wood 
processing, and pulp and paper. The volume of cargo shipments 
has decreased. 
  In spite of the reduction of the inflation level as compared 
to 1992, it is still fairly high. The commodity supply on the 
consumer market is decreasing. While foreign economic activity 
is expanding, the commodity structure of exports is 
deteriorating. The volume of paid services offered has decreased 
considerably. 
  Against a background of a relatively low level of officially 
registered unemployment, there has been an accumulation of 
concealed unemployment. 
<H5>  Indexes, Prices, and Rates </H5>
  During 1993 there was a steady rise of consumer prices in 
the 
republic. There was a ninefold increase in the price of 
foodstuffs, nonfoodstuffs--7.5-fold, and paid 
services--24.2-fold. Compared to December of the preceding year 
the prices of meat and poultry increased 13.3-fold, sausage 
items--11.7-fold, eggs--12.2- fold, vegetables--16.4-fold, 
margarine products--14.4-fold, and fruits--8.8-fold. Prices at 
the city markets increased 10.2-fold during this same period, 
including for crop growing products--10.9-fold, and animal 
husbandry products--12.1-fold. 
  The cost of a selection of the 19 most important food 
products in December was (taking the market into account) 22,390 
rubles [R] and it increased 8.5-fold as compared to December 
1992. 
  Prices of nonfoodstuffs increased 11.7-fold as 
compared to December 1992; fabric prices increased 7.5-fold, 
leather and textile footwear--12.6-fold, woolen 
fabrics--8.1-fold, clothing and linen--12.5-fold, and 
construction materials--9.9-fold. Prices of durable goods 
increased 9.5-fold, including: rugs--6.6-fold, furniture-- 
13.4-fold, and fur items--10.4-fold. 
  Prices and rates of consumer services increased 
13-fold as compared to December 1992, transportation 
services--ninefold, housing and municipal services--10-fold, 
cultural institutions--23.7-fold, and services of a legal nature 
and of banking institutions--20.6 percent. 
  By the end of 1993 there was a retardation of the growth of 
prices from the producers, which was influenced by the growing 
shortage of monetary funds among the majority of consumers of 
industrial products. As compared to December 1992, the highest 
rates of growth of prices were observed in the following 
branches: electric energy--16.1-fold, ferrous 
metallurgy--11.6-fold, electrical engineering--11-fold, and 
meat--15.3-fold. 
<H5>  The Standard of Living </H5>
  The monetary incomes of the population in December amounted 
to a total of R272 billion and had increased 9.6-fold as 
compared to the same period of 1992. This came to R72,800 per 
capita. 
  The average amount of wages paid to workers in December 1993 
was R128,100, a 9.5-fold increase as compared to the same period 
of 1992, including in industry, where it reached R118,100, 
agriculture--R113,700, construction--R189,100, 
transportation--R174,900, public education--R82,600, culture and 
art--R72,100, and public health--R99,900. 
  The subsistence minimum (Footnote 1) (The 
subsistence minimum was calculated on the basis of the 
methodology of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor. 
According to it the subsistence minimum includes: Costs of food 
products based on the minimum amounts of their consumption 
determined by the Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy 
of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Socioeconomic Problems of 
the Population of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the 
Ministry of Labor of Russia; expenditures on nonfoodstuffs and 
services, and also taxes and mandatory payments, based on the 
structure of expenditures on them among the 10 percent of the 
least well-off families.) on average per one resident increased 
10.2-fold as compared to December 1992 and amounted to R24,900. 
In 1993 there was a rise in the level of consumption of meat and 
meat products, fish, fruits and berries, sugar, vegetable oil, 
and other fats, while there was a reduction of the level of 
consumption of grain products, dairy products, and vegetables 
(except potatoes). 
  The overall number of citizens registered with the 
employment 
service who were not engaged in labor activity as of 1 January 
1994 was 12,800 individuals, 3,800 people, or 0.23 percent of 
the economically active population, had the official status of 
unemployed. About 100,000 people are working part time and are 
potentially unemployed. 
  According to a preliminary estimate, the population of the 
republic as of the beginning of 1994 amounted to 3.749 million. 
The reduction of the number was caused by unfavorable changes in 
the processes of natural reproduction: The level of the death 
rate (11.8 per 1,000 population) exceeds the level of the birth 
rate (11 per 1,000 population). 
  In 1993 there were positive aspects in the marriage and 
divorce processes: The number of marriages increased and the 
divorce rates slowed up. 
  Education. As of the beginning of the current 
school year there were 2,504 general educational schools in the 
republic, in which 551,800 children were studying. There are 
90,700 children studying in 457 schools with in-depth study of 
subjects, including 87 gymnasiums and 28 lyceums. There are 
seven nonstate schools in operation. In the republic 23 percent 
of the students attend the second shift and 10 schools conduct 
classes on three shifts. 
  There are 63,800 students in the 16 higher educational 
institutions and three branches, and 53,700 students in 65 
secondary specialized educational institutions and five 
branches. Four nonstate VUZ's [higher educational institutions] 
have received licenses and 1,075 individuals are studying in 
them. 
  The ecological situation. During 1993 there was a 
certain reduction of discharges of pollutants into the 
atmosphere and bodies of water, primarily because of the decline 
of industrial production. In 1993 there were nine cases of 
surging and emergency discharges and overflows of pollutants 
into the atmosphere, bodies of water, and land. 
  The consumer market. The retail commodity turnover 
of officially registered enterprises of state and cooperative 
trade, including public catering, during 1993 amounted to R866.9 
billion and had increased ninefold in actual prices as compared 
to the preceding year. The actual volume of commodity turnover 
in comparable prices decreased by 23.1 percent. 
  Still predominant in trade is the state sector, which 
accounted for 64 percent of the retail commodity turnover (in 
1992--65 percent), consumers' cooperative enterprises--19 
percent (20 percent), and the private sector--11 percent (1 
percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--16 percent (14 
percent). 
  About 55 percent of the retail commodity turnover is in food 
products (49 percent in 1992). The volume of sales of canned 
meats in 1993 as compared to 1992 increased by 60.4 percent, 
canned fish--40.2 percent, fish--12.6 percent, natural tea--21.9 
percent, and vegetable oil--19.9 percent. At the same time there 
was a reduction of the sale of margarine and margarine products 
by 48.3 percent, and meat and poultry--5.8 percent. 
  In Kazan 5.4 percent less products in comparable prices were 
sold during 1993 than during 1992. There was an increase in the 
volume of sales of onions--17 percent, mutton--16.8 percent, 
chickens--10.9 percent, geese--2.2-fold, and eggs--3.9 percent. 
At the same time there was a reduction of the sales volumes of 
fresh cabbage (14.8 percent), beets (13 percent), carrots (9.1 
percent), apples (18 percent), pork (7.1 percent), fresh milk 
(9.7 percent), and sour cream (13.5 percent). 
  The services market. During 1993 the republic 
population received paid services worth R61.8 billion, which in 
actual prices is 9.9 times higher than last year's level, but in 
comparable prices it is 35.6 percent less. 
  The volume of sales of consumer services in the report year 
was 8.4 times higher than in the preceding year, but in physical 
mass the volume rendered was 39.6 percent less. 
  There was an increase in the proportion of paid services for 
keeping children in preschool institutions, health protection, 
and services of a legal nature because of the sharp increases in 
prices and rates. The proportion of services of consumer service 
enterprises is tending to decrease. A large proportion of the 
population has been forced to do without a number of services 
because of their high cost. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  During 1993 industrial enterprises produced R3.103 trillion 
worth of products in current prices, which is 6.8 times more 
than during the preceding year. At the same time the index of 
the physical volume of industrial production was 85.1 percent of 
the 1992 level. 
  The process of destatization of enterprises has continued in 
industry this year. As of the beginning of 1994 36.7 percent of 
the large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, producing 
46.5 percent of the industrial output, had a nonstate form of 
ownership. 
  In the fuel and energy complex during 1993 as 
compared to the preceding year the extraction of oil decreased 
by 14.5 percent, gas--by 14.3 percent, and the production of 
electric energy--by 12.9 percent. 
  In machine building there was a reduction of the 
production of compressors (by 26.7 percent), large electrical 
machinery (54.5 percent), metal cutting machine tools (20 
percent), and trucks (34.9 percent). There was an increase in 
the output of passenger vehicles (16.9 percent), and 
installations for loading centrifugal electric pumps for 
extracting oil (4.9 percent). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry the 
output of synthetic resins and plastics increased by 4.6 percent 
as compared to 1992 but pipes and parts of thermal plastic 
pipelines produced from their basis decreased by 19.4 percent, 
and polymer films--by 19.5 percent. 
  As compared to 1992 there was a considerable reduction of 
the 
production of synthetic rubbers (27.8 percent), mineral 
fertilizers (41.9 percent), medical preparations enjoying high 
demand among the population and cardiovascular medications (32.9 
percent), and antibiotics (71.1 percent). 
  In the timber, wood processing, and pulp and paper 
industry last year the output of commercial timber 
decreased by 5.5 percent as compared to the 1992 level. The 
shortage of wood raw material led to a reduction of the 
production of window and door frames (by 43.3 percent), and 
plant manufactured houses (6.4 percent). There was an increase 
in the output of paper (by 39.8 percent) and cardboard (0.9 
percent). 
  In the construction materials industry in 1993 
there was a reduction as compared to the 1992 level of the 
production of construction brick--17.3 percent, linoleum--13.6 
percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and 
parts--13.1 percent. 
  At enterprises of light industry there was a 
reduction of the production of cotton fabrics--by 13.3 percent, 
knitted items--11.7 percent, and footwear--by 25.4 percent. 
  A more favorable situation has developed on the market for 
goods for cultural and domestic purposes and household use; 
there was an increase in the output of refrigerators--by 9.2 
percent. During the course of the conversion enterprises of the 
defense branch assimilated and began to produce freezers, 
electric mixers, grills, electric irons, telephones, ogonek 
fireplaces, stoves with numerical program control, etc. 
  In the food industry the production of meat, 
including subproducts of category I, butter, fatty cheeses, 
granulated sugar, cereals, confectionery items, nonalcoholic 
beverages, and mineral water exceeded the 1992 level. 
  Among the nonfoodstuffs in daily demand there was a 
reduction 
as compared to 1992 in the output of toilet soap (51.5 percent), 
household soap (27.3 percent), and detergents (17.2 percent). 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes begun in 1992 
is continuing. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes are still the main 
organizational form of management in rural areas of the 
republic. The number of farmer-run farms has increased and the 
allotment of land for collective gardening and orchard raising 
has continued. 
  In animal husbandry there has been a considerable increase 
in 
the delivery of products from farms of agricultural enterprises 
and also from private yards of the citizens. During 1993 the 
sale of cattle and poultry for slaughter increased, according to 
calculations, by 3 percent, and milk--by 7 percent. Egg 
production was at practically the same level as the preceding 
year. 
  The increase in the volume of production of animal husbandry 
products was brought about mainly by the increased productivity 
of the livestock. The average annual milk yield per cow on the 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes increased in 1993 by 8.1 percent, and 
eggs from one laying hen--by 1.3 percent, and there was an 
increase in the average daily weight gains of cattle and hogs. 
  Procurements of the main animal husbandry products increased 
in 1993 as compared to 1992 as follows: milk--by 9 percent, 
cattle and poultry--by 8 percent, and eggs--by 4 percent. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  Last year enterprises and organizations with all forms of 
ownership used R733.1 billion in capital investments, of which 
68 percent was used by state builders, 20 percent--by 
joint-stock companies, 9 percent--by kolkhozes and interfarm 
organizations, and 3 percent--by leasing and other enterprises. 
The volume of investments dropped as compared to 1992 by 5.5 
percent in comparable prices. 
  An amount of R475.3 billion was invested in the construction 
of production facilities, and their proportion of the overall 
volume decreased somewhat, amounting to 65 percent. Fixed 
capital valued at R337.1 billion was put into operation. 
  Capital investments of R257.7 billion went for the 
construction of nonproduction facilities. Of this amount, 59 
percent was used for housing construction, 8.2 percent--for 
construction of general educational schools, and 5.4 
percent--for construction of public health facilities. 
  Last year residential buildings were constructed with an 
overall area of 1,274,700 square meters, which is 12.2 percent 
less than in 1992, and 60 percent of the housing was constructed 
by enterprises of the state sector. 
  From all sources of financing the following were put into 
operation in the republic: general educational schools to 
accommodate 9,800 (63.4 percent of the 1992 level), preschool 
institutions to accommodate 3,000 (73.4 percent), hospitals with 
400 beds (113 percent), outpatient polyclinic institutions for 
1,500 visits per shift (9[figure illegible].1 percent), and 
clubs and houses of culture to accommodate 4,600 (114.9 percent). 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  In 1993 all kinds of general purpose transportation 
transported 88.5 million tonnes of cargo, including rail--15.3 
million tonnes, automotive--20.8 million tonnes, river--17.8 
million tonnes, air--0.03 million tonnes, and pipeline--34.6 
million tonnes. The volume of shipments decreased by 23.4 
percent as compared to 1992. 
  Passenger turnover on general purpose transportation 
decreased by 12 percent during the year. The movement of 
passengers increased only on rail transportation. 
  Communications enterprises rendered R27.5 billion in 
services, including consumer services--R3.8 billion. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  The volume of export-import operations of enterprises and 
organizations of the republic of Tatarstan through direct ties 
amounted to $948.5 million and increased by 45.9 percent. 
Exports from enterprises and organizations amounted to a total 
of $761.1 million and increased by 73.3 percent. Exports to the 
United States made up 26.9 percent of the overall volume, 
Turkey--12.2 percent, Germany--13.2 percent, Hungary--9.3 
percent, Switzerland--7.5 percent, the Czech Republic--6.8 
percent, and Italy--3.3 percent. In the commodity structure of 
the exports there was a predominance of petroleum fuel oil, 
synthetic rubbers, and trucks. 
  In 1993 enterprises and organizations of the republic 
imported $187.4 million under independently concluded contracts, 
which is 11.2 percent less than during the preceding year. 
Imports from Germany amounted to 18.6 percent of the overall 
volume, Great Britain--9.3 percent, Hungary--9.5 percent, 
Iran--7.1 percent, China--6.9 percent, Austria--6.2 percent, and 
Japan--5.4 percent. Equipment, instruments, foodstuffs, and 
clothing dominated in the commodity structure.

Tatarstan, at Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan 19th 
Session on 7 February 1994: "The Socioeconomic and Political 
Situation in the Republic"] 
  [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! 
  Examining the results of 1993 in the sphere of the economy, 
it may be said that together with individual positive changes, 
many of the negative trends of 1992 persisted. Stability in the 
economy has not, unfortunately, come about. The financial 
position of practically all major commodity producers at the 
present time is critical. 
  You all know the detailed results of the operation of the 
republic's economy--they have been published in the press. This 
January we held a whole number of working meetings with the 
directors of enterprises of all sectors, with the participation 
of the administration heads and the chairmen of the standing 
commissions of the Supreme Soviet, which made a frank analysis 
of the state of the economy and an assessment of the progress of 
the economic reforms. As a result the government charted paths 
of the gradual stabilization of production in particular sectors 
of industry. 
  The results of 1993 show that the decline in industrial 
production as a whole compared with 1992 constituted 14.9 
percent, which was somewhat better than in the Russian 
Federation, where the decline constituted 16.2 percent. It has 
to be considered here that the decline in the extractive sectors 
(oil and gas) was brought about by objective, natural factors 
and had been forecast by us. A telling factor in the decline in 
production in machine building was the situation following the 
fire at the Kama Truck Plant (the Kama Truck Plant accounts for 
3.1 percent of the decline). In a number of sectors here, in the 
agro-industrial complex primarily, the decline was halted, as a 
result of which an increase in production of 5.7 percent, not 
counting alcoholic products, was achieved in 1993 in food 
production, and, counting alcoholic products, the growth 
constituted 7.3 percent. An appreciable increase in volume was 
achieved in sugar (13.8 percent) and meat (1.1) industry and in 
the production of animal oil (22.1 percent), cheese (18.6 
percent), confectionery (4.7 percent), and nonalcoholic 
beverages (21.3 percent). At the same time, on the other hand, 
on account of reduced consumer demand there was somewhat of a 
decline in the production of whole-milk products and bakery and 
macaroni items. 
  Some 984,000 tonnes of grain, 837,000 tonnes of sugar beet, 
122,000 tonnes of potatoes, 82,000 tonnes of vegetables, 1.149 
million tonnes of milk, 232,000 tonnes of livestock and poultry, 
and 752 million eggs were procured for state resources, which 
was considerably in excess of the volume of purchases in the 
preceding year. The volume of production and procurements which 
was achieved makes it possible to preserve the current level of 
consumption of the basic foodstuffs in the republic. It should 
be noted here that only two or three regions of Russia achieved 
an increase in the production and procurements of farming and 
animal husbandry products.

  The positive results in the agrarian sector were achieved 
primarily thanks to the labor of our villagers and the active 
assistance of the state. The budget assumed half the expenditure 
on an increase in the fertility of the land and the outlays on 
reclamation, the construction of facilities of the social 
infrastructure of the countryside, the support of seed growing 
and pedigree breeding, the building of enterprises of food and 
processing industry, the development of science, and certain 
other measures. Some R156 billion of budget appropriations were 
channeled to this end in the past year. As a result a gross 
product 2 percent greater than in 1992 was produced. Meat, milk, 
and egg production increased. The biggest harvest of grain crops 
in the republic's history (approximately 23 quintals per 
hectare) was obtained. Seeds and forage were laid in in the full 
requirement, and the requisite quantity of grain for food was 
sold on account of remuneration of the kolkhoz members and 
sovkhoz workers. Thus the efforts of the government and many 
outfits in the past year produced certain positive results in 
respect to the stabilization of the economic situation in a 
number of life-sustaining sectors of the republic. 
  Sociopolitical stability, the basis of which is the active 
policy of social protection of the populace, which has been in 
effect since the start of the reforms and which has recently 
been specially targeted and perfected, has been preserved in the 
republic. Our approaches to these problems are being studied by 
many regions and are being perceived positively. 
  The two years of radical reforms have shown that the course 
chosen by the federal authorities is incapable of extricating 
the economy from crisis, which has led everyone to the 
conclusion of the need for certain corrections. Now, as we all 
know, a new course is being devised. Whatever the corrections, 
it is clear that the reforms begun in 1992 have reached a depth 
at which they have become irreversible. And we must regard this 
as a positive result. 
  What are the main landmarks of the reforms? 
  First, a partial price liberalization was undertaken. The 
abandonment of government regulation of prices switched 
inflation from a concealed state to an open form, which afforded 
an opportunity for correctly evaluating the state of the economy 
at the macro- and micro-levels. 
  Second, partial convertibility of the ruble was introduced. 
The fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate became an indicator 
and an actual instrument regulating the movement of capital and, 
partially, the dynamics of prices. 
  Third, the privatization process began. A basic package of 
laws of primary privatization was prepared and began to operate. 
Approximately one-half of property has already been privatized, 
in fact. It is still too early to speak of the efficiency of the 
activity of the privatized enterprises on account of the short 
amount of time they have been operating under the new 
conditions. But it may be affirmed even now that neither price 
liberalization nor privatization will in themselves resolve the 
problems of efficiency and that they should merely create the 
conditions and motives for the change and adaptation of the 
structure of production to market conditions of functioning. The 
following additional conditions are essential for this, in turn: 
financial stabilization and the possibility of the unrestricted 
transfer of capital. But we do not have this yet. It is 
essential, therefore, to create a secondary securities market, 
expand the circulation of bills, and so forth. 
  At the same time appreciable flaws have been discerned in 
the 
reforms: the reforms have been implemented mainly via 
instruments of macroeconomic policy, which has proven entirely 
insufficient, and have led merely to fragmentary changes in the 
conditions of the functioning of the economy, which has 
engendered a number of new problems. Thus it has become 
increasingly obvious that financial stabilization will not be 
achieved while the current policy is preserved since the 
struggle has been conducted not against the main causes of 
inflation but against its secondary factors. Inflation has 
assumed a steady, self-reproducing nature so that even were 
there a general mutual offsetting of arrears, the situation 
would in a very short space of time be what it was formerly, 
only at a new twist of the inflation spiral. Although there 
needs to be financial support for the priority areas even now, 
otherwise a severe recession and increased unemployment await us. 
  Reality itself has brought about an understanding of the 
truth that without the profound structural reorganization of the 
entire economy it will be impossible to emerge from the crisis 
slump. Whence also another conclusion: A structural 
reorganization of the cumbersome monopolized economic system 
that has taken shape over many decades cannot be undertaken 
rapidly, by radical measures, with the use merely of financial 
instruments at the macroeconomic level. 
  An escape from the impasse and real stabilization under the 
conditions of the evolved economy require an entirely different 
level of work of the state organs of administration. A 
surmounting of the cost-no-object nature of the economy and 
arrival at a sufficient level of competitiveness are possible 
only with the painstaking, persevering, and quite long-term work 
of the state at the macro- and micro-economic levels. The 
development of market reforms thus requires not a weakening but 
a strengthening of state influence on the economy, and it is 
production that is in need of this first and foremost. 
  A certain amount of work is being performed in this 
direction 
in Tatarstan. A concept of structural transformations of the 
economy of the republic has been devised. True, it also requires 
considerable modification. Even today we can speak about certain 
experience of the interaction of the government authorities on 
the structural reorientation of enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex of the Republic of Tatarstan based 
on the competitive selection and realization of business 
projects for specific areas encompassing sectors of the 
agro-industrial complex, the construction complex, the 
production of health-care equipment, and certain others. We 
attempted for the first time to link structural changes in the 
republic's economy with work at the level of specific 
enterprises with regard to the economic expediency of the 
projects and the timeframe of their cost recovery and the return 
of invested capital. 
  All these efforts made by the government of the republic 
unilaterally are undoubtedly insufficient for compensating for 
the wholesale reduction in government contracts for enterprises 
of the military-industrial complex. The reduction has proceeded 
at an increasing tempo: 22 percent in 1991, 44 percent in 1992, 
and 41 percent in 1993. The federal authorities have constantly 
reneged on their commitments pertaining to the funding of 
conversion measures. Use has been made even of a highly original 
method of "combating" inflation--the Government of the Russian 
Federation has simply not paid for the defense hardware product 
which it had ordered and which has been manufactured. The total 
arrears on the manufactured product in 1993 amount to more than 
R33 billion. 
  We are at the present time continuing to work with the 
Government of the Russian Federation at various levels to 
resolve the accumulated urgent problems. In January 1994 the 
government of the republic concluded an agreement with the 
Mashinoeksport Association, which had expressed a readiness to 
invest and participate in the realization of 18 innovation and 
conversion projects. The agreement determined over 70 items of 
interest for sale on the external market. All this is 
exceptionally important for the survival of our major 
enterprises and design bureaus under the conditions of 
transition to the market. 
  Market reforms have spotlighted the low efficiency of many 
industries. Thus the attempt to approximate the price of energy 
to the world price brought the price of oil to the present 
R50,000-60,000 a tonne. This is still less than half the average 
world price. But even here the price of the finished product of 
many sectors consuming energy as raw material is either very 
approximate to the world price or has already surpassed it. The 
main reasons for this phenomenon are low productivity and high 
unproductive outlays. 
  It should be observed that there has been practically no 
growth in productivity since the start of the reforms and that 
it has declined even at many enterprises. In the republic's 
industry as a whole the level of productivity in 1993 
constituted 89.7 percent of the 1992 level. 
  Many people are preferring not to recall this indicator 
even. 
Yet only a replacement of fixed capital with higher productivity 
can ensure a way out of the crisis under the conditions of the 
market. Nature has simply not devised any other mechanisms of 
the economy reaching the phase of upturn. The sooner, therefore, 
that we abandon illusions in the mythical expectation of 
everything being "resolved of its own accord," the sooner the 
prerequisites of the start of an escape from the impasse will be 
created. The situation will not start to improve before 
enterprises learn to introduce more productive capital and can 
on the basis of increased efficiency really reduce costs and, 
accordingly, prices. Whence the competitiveness of the 
manufactured commodity. 
  A difficult situation has come about at enterprises of the 
republic's oil and petroleum-refining industry. The 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Kazorgsintez stock companies and the 
S.M. Kirov Zavod S.K. Association are operating on the verge of 
the stoppage of individual works. This has been caused on the 
one hand by the crisis of arrears, the reduction in sales 
markets, the difficulties in purchasing raw material, and the 
further increase in the price of energy and, on the other, by 
the fact that the price of individual products has approached 
and even reached the world price. Even today the production of 
latex and ethylene oxide (stage one) has been terminated, and 
phenol, acetone, and divinyl will be next. One-third of the oil 
wells are unprofitable, and many of them are standing idle. 
This, in turn, is creating additional difficulties in the work 
of related sectors (the Kvart Stock Company, the 
Nizhnekamskshina Production Association, the Kazan Iskozh Plant, 
and so forth). 
  For the purpose of stabilizing the production activity of 
these outfits the government of the republic has been forced to 
adopt temporary measures to regulate the price of oil and the 
tariffs on the electric and thermal power which they consume. 
  Significant efforts are also being made by the work force of 
enterprises of the republic's petrochemical complex itself. 
Structural changes are being actively undertaken to reduce 
energy-consuming processes in the Tatneft Association and the 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Orgsintez stock companies. The creation 
of the Tatneftekhiminvestkholding financial and industrial group 
and the assistance of the government of the republic should 
contribute to the creation of the conditions for the assurance 
of normal reproduction for the entire complex. This is vitally 
important for the republic because it is they that provide the 
budget with the lion's share of revenue and that are 
life-supporting sectors. 
  The financial and economic situation that has taken shape in 
the republic requires a careful selection of facilities for 
funding, in-depth expert evaluation of the projects which are 
submitted, and subsequent on-the-spot supervision of the 
targeted use of the allocated funds. 
  The efficient functioning of the economy of enterprises and 
organizations under reform conditions demands a prompt and 
flexible response to the constantly changing requirements of the 
market. Where this has been understood and the conclusions have 
been drawn, there is evidence of positive results. We may 
include in this category the Kazan Terminal Production 
Association, where conversion is being undertaken successfully. 
At the end of 1992 even approximately 90 percent of the 
manufactured product here was composed of military orders, which 
were dropped practically simultaneously. But thanks to the 
presence of unique technology and powerful and multilevel 
production potential, the association rapidly switched to the 
manufacture of a variety of peaceful products which the public 
needs, has recovered from the shock of conversion, it may be 
said, and is getting back on its feet. It is gratifying that 
these are not just isolated examples. The experience of the work 
of the Vakuummash Enterprise, the Kvart, Elekon, and KMIZ stock 
companies, the Almetyevsk Submersible Pump Plant, and certain 
others shows how it is possible to organize the assimilation and 
production of new products in a short space of time. It is 
essential that the managers of the republic's enterprises study 
their experience and adopt vigorous measures for the 
restructuring of their production with regard to the demands of 
the market. 
  Proceeding from the current situation, the forecast for 1994 
is oriented toward selective support of the life-sustaining 
sectors of production: Support will be rendered to the 
agro-industrial complex and also the enterprises that are 
prepared to provide for the rapid recovery of resources invested 
in the interests of the republic's economy. 
  A certain reduction in the production of oil and gas is 
planned--90.8 percent of the 1993 level. The output of a number 
of petrochemical products is to increase: polyethylene (104.2 
percent), rubber (108.8 percent), and building materials (103.8 
percent), including bricks (104.6 percent). 
  We are expecting a certain growth in the production of 
consumer goods, both of the nonfood group and food, which is to 
contribute to the preservation of political stability in the 
republic. 
  The Kama Truck Plant Stock Company is to be standing on its 
own two feet in the current year, and we are hoping for an 
appreciable growth in motor-vehicle production. 
  As we all know, on 16 April 1993 the Kama Truck Plant Stock 
Company Engines Plant was destroyed as a result of a fire and 
shut down. Within two weeks following the accident the board of 
directors of the Kama Truck Plant and the KamGESenergostroy 
Concern had concentrated at this site more than 100 heavy cranes 
and more than 10,000 workers and had organized people's 
around-the-clock flexible-shift work without weekends or 
holidays. Within three months the mounds of metal structures 
with a total weight of 90,000 tonnes had been pulled apart and 
the replacement installation of the housing of the engine plant 
had begun. Despite difficulties over financing, the installation 
of part of the block with an area of 220,000 square meters had 
been completed, heating had been supplied and the manufacture of 
components had begun, and the manufacture of the power unit of 
the KamAZ vehicle had been resumed by 1 November 1993, and the 
final block of the roof at the engine plant with a total area of 
420,000 square meters was installed on 25 January 1994. It would 
be unfair not to commend with gratitude today the work of these 
splendid outfits. 
  Targeted development programs of various levels: interstate, 
interregional, republic, and so forth, could be a direction of 
the stabilization of the economy. Studies are currently being 
conducted with the Government of Russia on participation in the 
financing of a number of large-scale programs such as 
maintenance of the level of oil production, a resolution of the 
environmental and social problems of the oil regions, and the 
reconstruction of the petrochemical works, the Zainskaya and 
Urussinskaya state regional electric power stations, the Kama 
Truck Plant Heat and Electric Power Plant, and a number of 
others. 
  I would like to make particular mention of the YelAZ. Its 
fate has been difficult since the disintegration of the USSR. 
The consistent steps adopted by the leadership of Tatarstan and 
the Russian Federation could produce positive results. The 
concept of the further construction of the YelAZ and the 
unification to this end of the efforts of Russia and the former 
Union republics is gradually being put into practice. The 
intergovernmental agreement "Joint Creation of a Complex of 
Machinery of the Automotive Plant in the City of Yelabug" was 
signed and the share of the contributions of each party was 
determined in April 1993 in Minsk. The participants included the 
Russian Federation, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Ukraine and 
the republics of Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The YelAZ-invest Consortium, whose 
main purpose is the concentration of the investors' resources 
for this large-scale construction project, was formed and 
registered last September in Tatarstan. The parties' first 
contributions to the original capital have now been made, and it 
is contemplated in the current year forming the capital fund in 
full. 
  The government support for the YelAZ has revived interest in 
the project on the part of national business circles and foreign 
capital. Numerous proposals concerning participation in the 
creation of the automotive plant, on the part of the world's 
biggest automotive companies (DEU of South Korea, General Motors 
of the United States, Renault of France, and Volkswagen of 
Germany) included, are being received. All this affords an 
opportunity for a start on the creation of modern, competitive 
motor-vehicle production, and this opportunity needs to be 
realized. 
  I would like to say a few words also about the procedure of 
the purchases of agricultural products and raw material in 1994. 
The point being that the Edict of the President of Russia of 27 
October 1993 "On Regulation of Land Relations and the 
Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" abolishes as of 1994 
the compulsory supplies and other forms of the compulsory 
confiscation of agricultural products for state resources. We 
believe that such an approach corresponds to the requirements of 
normal market relations. But in agriculture, for a variety of 
reasons, market relations are taking shape extremely slowly as 
yet, and the conditions have not been created for the production 
of competitive products. Considering these circumstances, it 
would be expedient to preserve for the current year the system 
of procurements of agricultural products based on forward 
contracting agreements between the commodity producers and the 
procurement officers in the amounts of the 1993 level. 
  I consider impermissible the formulation of the question of 
a 
reduction in the amount of the commodity product on the part of 
individual leaders of rayons and kolkhozes and sovkhozes since 
this would lead primarily to a reduction in the income of the 
rural population and also of purchasing power. 
  In 1993 the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan raised 
the purchase price of agricultural products repeatedly, ensuring 
the minimum profitability of the sector here. At the same time, 
on the other hand, it is essential to emphasize that a 
sufficient level for realizing expanded reproduction was not 
secured. And in the future it will be necessary to 
systematically revise the level of procurement prices and 
subsidies for agricultural products with regard to the reduction 
in the extent of the direct allocation to agriculture of capital 
investments from the republic budget. 
  Realization of land reform will continue in 1994. The number 
of peasant (private) farms will have reached more than 1,000 in 
the year. It is essential that the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food complete reform of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes with regard 
to accumulated experience, with the allocation to all members of 
the work force of a property share and allotments of land. This 
will interest the villagers to a considerable extent in the end 
results of production. 
<H5>  State of Affairs in the Republic's Construction Complex </H5>
  A decisive role in the accumulation not only of the 
production potential but also the entire national wealth of the 
republic belongs to the construction complex. It encompasses 615 
construction organizations and 65 enterprises of construction 
materials industry. Its share of generated national income 
constitutes more than 10 percent, and it employs approximately 
200,000 persons. Here, as in other sectors, changes are under 
way, and a transition to market relations is being effected. 
  The privatization of enterprises and the formation of new 
structures have contributed to a redistribution of investment 
volumes. Thus the share of the investments of state-owned 
enterprises in the sum total declined from 78 percent in 1992 to 
67 percent in 1993. At the same time there was an increase in 
the share of investments of stock companies--from 6 to 20 
percent respectively--and it grew somewhat for individual 
builders also. 
  The ratio of the amounts of capital investments in the 
construction of facilities for production and nonproduction 
purposes changed in favor of the latter from 25 percent of the 
total volume in 1985 to 35 percent in 1993. 
  The volume of capital investments in 1993 declined 5.5 
percent compared with the 1992. The decline occurred because of 
the reduction in capital investments in respect to production 
facilities (90.3 percent of the 1992 level). There was 
growth--103.2 percent--in terms of nonproduction facilities, and 
investments in housing construction remained at the 1992 level. 
  The reduction in investments is occurring because of the 
decline in the investment activity of builders of all forms of 
property (on account of the high degree of inflation, 
evidently). A precise government program in respect to the most 
important investment projects, in which it is necessary to 
specify measures for their protection against inflation, should 
be adopted in this connection. 
  The shortage of capital for investments is being made worse 
by the inadequate efficiency in the organization of construction. 
  In 1993 builders of all forms of property commissioned R337 
billion of fixed capital, which was almost R400 billion less 
than utilized capital investments. There are only 46 kopeks of 
fixed capital introduced per R1 of invested assets (99 kopeks in 
1985). 
  Market mechanisms in capital construction have yet to begin 
to operate to the full extent. As previously also, facilities 
are mainly introduced at the end of the year, the construction 
front remains, as before, extraordinarily wide, and capital 
investments are dispersed around a large number of construction 
projects. 
  According to a preliminary estimate, the extent of 
incomplete 
construction as of the start of 1994 will have increased by a 
factor of 1.5 and will have exceeded the amount of utilized 
capital by 42 percent. 
  Some R258 billion of capital investments were used for the 
construction of facilities of the social sphere in 
January-December 1993. 
  The commissioning of nonproduction facilities exceeded the 
indicators of the preceding year as follows: by 13 percent for 
hospitals (beds) and by 15 percent for clubhouses and houses of 
culture. 
  In terms of general schools, preschools, and 
outpatient-clinic establishments there was a reduction in 
introduction compared with the 1992 level of 37, 27, and 4 
percent respectively. 
  Of the total amount of nonproduction capital investments, 59 
percent (R151.8 billion) were channeled into housing 
construction. Some 1.275 million square meters of total living 
space were introduced in 1993, which constitutes 88 percent of 
the amount introduced in 1992. Despite the repeated criticisms, 
the government proved incapable of rectifying matters in the 
construction complex, and the situation continues to 
deteriorate, what is more. In the course of preparation of this 
report the construction workers and their sponsors gave me, in 
my view, specialist material containing recommendations as to 
how matters may be rectified rapidly in construction under the 
conditions of transition to the market. Approving your advice, I 
would simultaneously ask you to put it into practice in the 
current year. There will very shortly be a republic construction 
conference, at which a detailed analysis will be made and at 
which measures to increase the efficiency of the construction 
complex are to be formulated. 
<H5>  Progress of Privatization </H5>
  The progress of privatization in the republic was examined 
and the new tasks were determined recently with the 
participation of administration heads, the leaders of ministries 
and departments and major enterprises, and people's deputies of 
the republic. 
  Some 43 percent of enterprises in industry, 35 percent in 
the 
construction complex, and 32.3 percent in the agro-industrial 
complex have been privatized at the present time. Plans for the 
privatization of 360 large and medium-sized enterprises with a 
total capital fund of more than R500 billion have been approved. 
They include such giants as the Tatneft, the 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim, Organicheskiy sintez, the KMPO, the KVPO, 
the Tatstroy, the Tatmyasoagroprom, and others. A further 1,200 
enterprises approximately are in a privatization mode. 
  As we can see, there are certain results. But small-scale 
privatization in the republic is proceeding markedly behind 
schedule, unfortunately. Whereas the large stores and wholesale 
depots retained as state property have already been converted, 
in the main, the privatization of small enterprises of trade, 
public catering, and consumer service is only at the start of 
the route. 
  I would like once more to call your attention, that of 
administration heads primarily, to the need for the most 
decisive and assertive action to be taken, and no less than 
60-70 percent of small cafes, restaurants, workshops, 
hairdressers, and stores should find new owners in the current 
year. 
  A few words about IPV (registered privatization deposits). 
It 
is necessary that this mechanism of the noncompensable transfer 
of property to our citizens operate with precision. On the 
whole, there is firm confidence that all 100 percent of the IPV 
will be "materialized." The task locally is to describe and 
explain persuasively and intelligibly to everyone how to 
competently dispose of the privatization deposit. 
  Today we are faced with one further task of enormous state 
importance--the privatization of housing. Two months have 
elapsed since this law took effect. In the majority of cities 
and districts of the republic this work has begun in organized 
fashion, precisely, and without red tape. But there are 
shortcomings also, unfortunately. Attempts are being made in 
places to complicate the process of the privatization of 
housing, and various restrictions are being invented and 
artificially devised in addition to the law, which is 
categorically prohibited. There have been instances of the 
citizens' lack of knowledgeability and of their having been kept 
in the dark both as to the essence of the law and the benefits 
accruing to an owner who has privatized his residence. It seems 
to many inhabitants of the republic for some reason or other 
that if they privatize their apartment, they are immediately 
inundated with incredibly high expenses for its upkeep and so 
forth. And such disinformation is coming from certain government 
officials, who are in this way simply attempting to intimidate 
people. 
  The task of the local organs of power and administration is 
to do everything for the rapid transfer of housing to the public 
strictly in accordance with the law. A housing market has to be 
created. 
  Concluding this part of my speech, I will say that 
privatization is a most important area of our activity in the 
current year. And we intend to implement it decisively. 
<H3>  Execution of the Consolidated and Republic Budgets of the 
Republic of Tatarstan </H3>
  The republic budget for 1993 was executed in revenue terms 
to 
the extent of 284 percent of the plan voted by the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. The indicators of the 
consolidated budget, in respect to which execution for the year 
constituted 311 percent, were somewhat better. 
  The excess of revenue over expenditure in terms of the 
republic budget constituted R2.6 billion or 0.5 percent of the 
overall budget. In respect to the local budgets these indicators 
are somewhat higher and constitute R9.6 billion or 2 percent of 
total revenue respectively. 
  The plans were overfulfilled thanks, in the main, to 
unpredictable price factors. At the same time, on the other 
hand, the absence of a mechanism for curbing inflation brought 
about a slowdown in settlements in the economy, which, in turn, 
led to a growth of reciprocal arrears, a complication of the 
financial situation of many enterprises, and, as a result, to a 
budget revenue shortfall. 
  In terms of the year's results, on account of the continuing 
trend of the growth of nonpayments, there was a budget revenue 
shortfall of more than R200 billion of value-added tax and 
profits tax in respect to four most important taxpayers 
(Tatneft, Tatenergo, Nizhnekamskshina, and Nizhnekamskneftekhim) 
alone. 
  The problem of payment discipline remains acute. The basic 
tax arrears as of 1 January 1994 amounted to more than R42 
billion. 
  Budget expenditure grew at a more rapid pace (compared with 
revenue). Practically the entire overfulfillment of the revenue 
side was channeled into the sectors' growing need for financial 
resources. In this connection the expenditure of the republic 
and consolidated budgets was executed for 1993 at 256 and 264 
percent respectively. 
  There was supplementary expenditure from the republic budget 
in 1993 totaling over R300 billion, of which more than half was 
channeled into covering expenses connected with the pay 
increases in the nonproduction sphere. 
  At the same time the budget was not drawn up or executed 
with 
the maximum austerity, nor was full account taken of the 
economic possibilities of the republic. 
  The carryover indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993 
in 
respect to sectors of the economy, capital investments, and 
other measures constituted more than R50 billion. 
  In terms of the year's results the majority of local budgets 
(certain municipal budgets constitute the sole exception) failed 
to create a sufficient reserve of financial resources for the 
financing in full of pay, which was raised as of 1 December, and 
facilities of capital construction (aside from housing) and the 
creation of stocks of fuel and materials. 
  This was caused mainly by the diversion of budget resources 
by the leaders of districts and cities for nonpriority 
expenditure and also the financing of activities and sectors 
which are not a part of the budget system, without regard to 
forthcoming budget expenditure. 
  According to preliminary calculations, approximately R50 
billion in terms of local budgets were diverted for expenditure 
not connected with a budget classification. Thus in Bugulminskiy 
and Tukayevskiy districts and the cities of Almetyevsk, Bugulm, 
and Nizhnekamsk substantial budget resources were invested in 
bank deposits, and credit was granted to various enterprises and 
organizations, some of which has still not been returned to the 
budget. 
  A substantial amount of the revenue of the local budgets 
which had been obtained additionally was channeled into the 
purchase of automobiles, furniture, computers, and the provision 
of the district centers with amenities in Mamalyshskiy, 
Zainskiy, Bavlinskiy, and Mustyumovskiy districts. 
  In addition, according to data of the Ministry of 
Agriculture 
and Food, budget resources allocated for gas supply in 
Alkeyevskiy, Aktanyshskiy, Spasskiy, Tetyushskiy, 
Tyulyachinskiy, and Pestrechinskiy districts were used for 
purposes other than those specifically intended. 
  The concept of the formation of the system of the budget of 
the republic for 1994 should be geared mainly to the 
survivability of the current network of social and cultural 
institutions, the social protection of the population, the 
completion of the construction, which has begun, of housing and 
other facilities of the social sphere due for introduction, and 
maintenance at the requisite level of sectors of the economy, 
prices and tariffs in which are regulated by the state. 
  Preliminary calculations do not afford grounds for 
forecasting a marked improvement in the condition of the budget 
in the first quarter of the current year compared with the 
fourth quarter of last year, and despite the most modest 
expenditure, therefore, the budget deficit will reach 40 percent 
of revenue. 
  In this connection it is essential, in addition to the 
accomplishment of the paramount task of reducing enterprise 
arrears, to take decisive steps for a reduction in unproductive 
expenditure and the economical and targeted use of budget 
resources. A further release of tariffs and a revision of 
allowances in housing and municipal service and transport are 
required. 
  It would be expedient to adopt, on the basis of budget 
possibilities, a realistic program of capital construction for 
1994 and to take the path of the restriction of the funding of 
particular large-scale projects and programs, adopted by the 
Supreme Soviet of Republic of Tatarstan included. 
<H5>  Social Policy </H5>
  A principal task in social policy is that of a rise in 
personal income. 
  In December the living standard in Tatarstan had practically 
reached the mark of approximately 3 (2.92, to be precise), and 
in the Russian Federation, 2 (more precisely, 1.89). This means 
that the per capita income of the inhabitants our republic is 
almost three times higher than the value of the subsistence 
minimum (per capita income in Tatarstan in December was R72,771, 
and the subsistence minimum, R24,918; in Russia per capita 
income was R84,000, the subsistence minimum, R44,352). I have to 
mention here that we need subsequently to take as the basis not 
the subsistence minimum but the minimum budget or some other 
concept with a higher expenditure plank. 
  The average wage in the republic in December constituted 
R128,000 (R130,000 in the Russian Federation). A pretty good 
level, although December is not all that regular a month when it 
comes to monetary payments in connection with the annual and 
quarterly bonuses (the average monthly wage in 1993 in the 
Republic of Tatarstan was R52,600, in the Russian Federation, 
R58,600). As we can see, the gap has been narrowed. 
  At the previous session we adopted a responsible 
decision--laws on the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage, 
on the basis of which minimum remuneration could not be below 
the subsistence minimum. In February the subsistence minimum is 
forecast at the level of R30,000, and this means that minimum 
remuneration also must be the same. I believe that this session 
will adopt such a decision. 
  An increase in pay in 1993 was observed in all spheres of 
the 
economy, but the rate thereof differed considerably in both the 
sectoral and territorial respects. 
  The situation involving the income of those working at many 
industrial enterprises, particularly at enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex, is causing serious concern. In 
comparable values, the living standard in terms of these 
enterprises is considerably below the republic average. And the 
average wage at some of them (not the most unfortunate, what is 
more) is approximately 60 percent of the average wage in the 
republic. Consequently, employees of industrial enterprises 
enjoy more compensation from the Social Support Fund. Enterprise 
managers are of the view that an increase in the minimum wage 
would entail a multiple increase in the price of their products. 
An analysis has shown that this would bring about an increase in 
price of no more than 11 percent, but would permit an increase 
in the employees' income. 
  We are at the present time seriously reconsidering the 
policy 
of subsidies to a number of sectors. A phased transfer of the 
subsidies of housing and municipal services and transport to 
personal income has begun. An interesting picture is taking 
shape in these sectors, incidentally. That same indicator of the 
living standard of employees of these sectors is far higher than 
the republic average, not to mention that of industry. But to 
return to the problem of subsidies, as of the situation in 
February, with a value of the subsistence minimum for the 
populace of approximately R30,000, each urban resident is 
subsidized a further R39,000. Of these, 18 percent are composed 
of subsidies for food, 58 percent, for housing and municipal 
services, 23 percent, for transport, and the rest, for medicinal 
support. That is, transport is subsidized more than food, and 
the subsidies for housing and municipal services are almost 
equal to the entire value of the subsistence minimum. This is 
food for thought. It is necessary, evidently, to analyze the 
entire system of norms contained in the package of services of 
this sector. An example: There is an established norm of the 
consumption of cold water per person of 200 liters a day. That 
is, if there is central water supply, it is considered that a 
person consumes this quantity daily! But this is impossible. The 
norms obviously contain the entire actual consumption of the 
sector. But the interests of the residents need to be protected 
also, we cannot shift onto them payment for all expenditure, 
unsubstantiated expenditure included. 
  An analysis shows that foodstuffs, and they are consumed by 
all inhabitants, are subsidized least of all currently. In 
addition, as I have already said, housing and municipal services 
are subsidized, yet they are enjoyed to a greater extent by 
those who live in apartments with conveniences. And the 
"slum-dwellers" are socially oppressed here also. We are 
continuing to direct huge subsidy resources haphazardly. It is 
essential that the government look into this and adopt the 
appropriate decisions as quickly as possible. 
  There are many questions concerning preschools. The measures 
adopted at the federal level for the protection of the family 
and children are being transformed here in the republic with 
regard to the current program of targeted social protection. 
What is the situation here? In connection with the increase in 
the price of energy resources there has been a considerable 
increase in the cost of keeping children in preschool 
institutions (keeping one child in February will cost more than 
R50,000). The support of preschools is a heavy burden on the 
enterprises, which many of them cannot sustain. The government 
has adopted a number of measures to preserve the network of 
preschools, for example, approximately 500 preschool 
institutions catering for approximately 70,000 children will in 
the current year be taken onto the books of the local soviets. 
But some will, as before, remain on the books of the 
enterprises, and, lest we destroy the preschool system, we need 
to adopt a decision on the support of enterprises when it comes 
to maintaining preschool institutions by way of compensation 
from the budget for the cost of children's meals. 
  The protection of our citizens against the inferior quality 
of goods and services is a cause for concern. There is now a 
need for the creation of a state committee to coordinate policy 
in the sphere of quality and the protection of consumers' 
rights. This committee would be entrusted with the coordination 
of activity in the solution of questions connected with the 
quality of goods and services, an analysis of the state and 
prospects of the development of the production of products which 
are environmentally clean and noninjurious to one's health, 
pricing, and the protection of consumers' rights. This must not 
be a toothless body. We need to accord the committee 
wide-ranging powers, including the right of inspections and the 
application of strict economic and administrative sanctions, the 
right to remove from production and withdraw from circulation 
substandard goods and services and to terminate operations, and 
the possibility of preparing and forwarding to the public 
prosecutor's office and the courts documents with the object of 
the institution of proceedings against the producers of 
substandard goods and services, including formulation of the 
question of their closure and liquidation. In connection with a 
tightening of the demands on the quality of goods and services 
problems of the development of medium-sized and small business 
require special attention, and the adoption of the corresponding 
prescriptive enactments in support of them needs to be speeded 
up here. 
  Health care is in a transitional phase at this time in 
connection with the Medical Insurance Act taking effect. The 
concern of a number of deputies proposing alternatives of the 
activity of the medical insurances funds in the immediate period 
is understandable. I believe it necessary to study the 
experience of health care of Moscow and Moscow Oblast, which 
have retained questions of protection of the health of mother 
and child as publicly funded for 1994-1995. We should, possibly, 
do the same. 
<H5>  State of the Fight Against Crime </H5>
  Considering that in January at an enlarged meeting of the 
collegium of the MVD and the Public Prosecutor's Office these 
problems were examined in detail, I would like to emphasize once 
again that the fight against crime has been and remains a 
principal direction in the activity of the president and all 
organs of state power called on to deal with this. While 
evaluating positively the efforts of all law enforcement 
authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan for realization of the 
Law "On Special Measures To Fight Crime" which we have adopted, 
we have agreed at the meetings that have been held to step up 
this fight even more and make it more effective. The main thing 
is that the law enforcement authorities are now confident that 
it is possible to curb this evil. I refer to the results of 
1993. The crime detection rate increased from 52 to 64 percent. 
The growth of crime declined. It is very important that 11,000 
more criminal cases were sent to the courts here than in 1992. 
The struggle to unmask top crime groupings is being intensified. 
The replacement and, I would say, improvement of the personnel 
composition in the law enforcement authorities themselves 
continue. The public demands protection of us, and we are 
required to provide it. 
<H5>  Political Situation in the Republic </H5>
  Esteemed People's Deputies! The political development of the 
Republic of Tatarstan in the past year was marked by a number of 
important trends. They included continuation of the building of 
the new statehood of Tatarstan on the basis of the Constitution 
and laws of the Republic of Tatarstan; the formation of its own 
legal system and the creation of a multiparty system and a wide 
field for the interaction of various parties and movements; the 
effect of the mechanism of negotiations and consultations with 
the Russian Federation; the stimulation of international 
cooperation; and so forth. 
  In our opinion, these will remain the priority directions in 
1994 also. The most important task for us undoubtedly was and 
remains political and economic stability in Tatarstan, the 
infusion of its sovereignty with actual content with an 
orientation toward observance of human rights and liberties, 
economic reforms, and the formation of political and managerial 
structures in keeping with the requirements of the times. Much 
work has to be done. But the accomplishment of this task is not 
only essential but realistic also. The right to speak this way 
is accorded by the main, evolved factor of the republic's 
civilized development, development which is, I would say, 
conscious and has a sense of its own dignity. We are talking 
about civil peace and social accord, respect for the working 
man, and the harmony of the general and the national. For it is 
no accident that the words "Tatarstan is our common home" and 
"Tatarstan is my home" are today being spoken with pride by the 
representatives of all nationalities that live in the republic. 
And we see this as a guarantee that this home will in the future 
be more stable and richer both materially and spiritually. Yes, 
this home has, we know, its difficulties, its complexities, 
which home does not at this time? But the main thing is that we 
not only know our own problems but are resolving them also. 
This, most likely, explains the growing authority of Tatarstan 
in Russia, among the CIS countries, and in the far abroad. 
  Esteemed Comrades! Present-day political life, with all its 
complexities and problems, requires that each of us be a 
pragmatist and realist and see things as they really are, not as 
we would like them to be. There are objective processes and 
phenomena, and they cannot be ignored. We are guided by such an 
approach when tackling problems of the building and reform of 
the relations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian 
Federation. It is no secret that these problems are central 
problems in the political life of Tatarstan and that, owing to 
their special significance, they will remain such in the future 
also. 
  The Supreme Soviet and the entire community of the republic 
have constant information on the progress of the negotiations of 
official delegations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the 
Russian Federation on the concept of a future treaty on the 
delineation of terms of reference and the mutual delegation of 
authority by organs of state power of the Republic of Tatarstan 
and the Russian Federation built on the harmonization of the two 
constitutions and unconditional respect for the rights of the 
individual, regardless of his nationality, sex, or religious 
belief. 
  The break in the treaty process, which had been protracted 
under the influence of a number of social events in Russia, is 
now over. At our January meeting with B.N. Yeltsin, president of 
the Russian Federation, aside from the consideration of a number 
of questions of the economy and the problem of oil production 
and the ecological situation in the oil regions of the republic, 
agreement was reached on the completion of the preparation of 
the treaty and intergovernmental agreements on foreign economic 
activity, the fight against crime, the budget and taxes, 
military organizational development, and the banks. The official 
delegations of the parties and their leaders (V.N. Likhachev and 
M.G. Saburov and S.M. Shakhray and Yu.F. Yarov) obtained 
specific recommendations. 
  It may be said as a preliminary evaluation that an entirely 
new document, practically unprecedented, which proclaims the 
primacy of human rights and the principles of Tatarstan's 
relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and 
international organizations, is being engendered. Particular 
attention will be paid to the sphere of the joint competence of 
the parties' organs of state power. The formation of 
plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and 
Moscow respectively is contemplated. 
  The majority of articles have been harmonized and many 
questions that had previously given rise to arguments and 
different positions have been dropped now. I have to mention 
something else also. The atmosphere that reigns at the 
negotiations is cordial, and one senses a desire of the parties 
to understand one another and find a compromise. The entire work 
undoubtedly requires patience and intellectual effort. 
  I believe there will soon be a treaty, on which we have 
worked for so long. It will be evidence of the reform of Russia 
and a renewal of the Federation on a democratic basis and will 
be a guarantor of the statehood of our republic. I am sure that 
this treaty will be accepted not only in the Russian Federation 
and in Tatarstan but by the international community also. 
  Knowing all this, one is for the umpteenth time perplexed at 
how certain forces in the republic perceive the work that is 
being done. Some terms of individual publications of the 
so-called "democratic" press are something else: "haggling," 
"conspiracy against the people," "undermining of human rights," 
and some even more scathing. What is this--naivete or political 
calculation aimed at sowing confusion and introducing doubt in 
people's minds? Both, most likely. But how long is it possible 
to go on living according to the principle: "the worse, the 
better"? Speaking on behalf of the people, and many social and 
political movements are guilty of this currently, incidentally, 
we are entitled only to creation in the interests of our people. 
Nor can other types of statements coming from so-called 
national-radical groups be overlooked. Their meaning is clear, 
and you could not call them constructive. Truly, how is it 
possible to call for official relations or contacts with Russia 
and the political structures that operate there to be ignored, 
knowing that citizens of Tatarstan have citizenship of the 
Russian Federation and that a common economic space with the 
Russian Federation is preserved? There is a mass (I repeat, 
mass) of questions, which may be solved only with the closest 
connection and cooperation of Russia and Tatarstan for the good 
of their peoples. 
  One has the impression that certain politicians, political 
intriguers more like, have been left here without subjects of 
political struggle and are attempting, once again not to 
people's benefit, to create them artificially. 
  Such are certain political reference points of the Republic 
of Tatarstan. They have proven their relevance and will remain 
such in the future also. Grounded in reality, they demand 
strenuous work of all of us. 
  Proceeding from the progress of the negotiations and the 
need 
for the realization subsequently of mutual relations with the 
Russian Federation established on the basis of a treaty, I 
consider essential the participation of plenipotentiary 
representatives of Tatarstan both in the State Duma and in the 
Federation Council of Russia. While paying tribute to the 
efforts of the organs of state power of the Republic of 
Tatarstan in the establishment of civilized democratic relations 
with the Russian Federation in the interests of our peoples, I 
am sure that the population of the republic will demonstrate 
support for this policy by actively participating in the repeat 
elections on 13 March. 
  Speaking once again about the reform of the representative 
and executive authorities, I may emphasize yet again the need 
for reform via elections on a multiparty basis. As the progress 
of the reform of the representative bodies in a number of 
republics shows, the principles of the form of government which 
I have proposed and the procedure of elections set forth at the 
first sitting of the 18th session remain the most acceptable. 
This is, I believe, our ultimate destination. 
  Esteemed People's Deputies! There was a considerable 
expansion and intensification of the Republic of Tatarstan's 
relations in the sphere of the economy, culture, education, 
agriculture, health care, and so forth in 1993 with countries of 
the far and near abroad. Just recently we could not have dreamed 
even that Tatarstan could have established direct contacts with 
foreign states or have concluded agreements and treaties 
oriented not toward ideological precepts and political or some 
other predilections but toward goals of vital importance to the 
republic and its citizens. 
  The Republic of Tatarstan is becoming an object of close 
attention on the part of authoritative international 
organizations such as the European Parliament, UNESCO, OPEC, and 
so forth. And of considerable importance in this connection, in 
our view, is the fact that these organizations not only 
understand our republic's role and position in the current 
period but also approve many of the steps we have taken geared 
to the stabilization of the situation both in the Republic of 
Tatarstan and in the Russian Federation as a whole.

Andreyev, chief of the Department of Political Science at Kuban 
State University, under the rubric "Bearings": "The Cossack 
Movement: Trends and Prospects"] 
  [Text] The Cossack movement has become one of the 
significant elements in the sociopolitical and sociocultural 
life of present-day Russia. Experts estimate that at present 
there are about 5 million descendants of Cossacks in the Russian 
Federation, who as a rule reside both in areas of traditional 
settlement of their ancestors (Don, the Kuban, Terek, the Urals, 
and the Transbaykal area) and in large cities (Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Samara, and 
Voronezh). Many of them have formed the social foundation for 
the organizational establishment of the Cossack estate in Russia 
in the late 1980's and early 1990's. 
  The modern-day Cossack movement emerged in stages. The 
creation of cultural-educational and military-historical Cossack 
societies in 1988-1989 can be considered the point of departure. 
At the first stage these structures resembled organizationally 
amorphous discussion clubs with a patriotic orientation. 
However, it was precisely within these societies that the 
process of perceiving and ideologically expressing the need for 
the rebirth of the Cossack estate developed. This phenomenon did 
not escape the attention of local party committees. Moreover, 
some of them, perceiving the Cossacks as a major sociopolitical 
force capable of becoming the backbone of the authoritarian 
regime, tried to lay their hands on the movement. In the future, 
this fact engendered a contradictory response to the rebirth of 
the Cossack estate among the population and major differences 
within the movement itself. 
  The second stage of the assertion of the Cossack movement 
embraced the period from the beginning of 1990 through August 
1991. During the first half of 1990 extensive preparations were 
made for holding the Cossack Grand Assembly, which was held on 
28-30 July 1990 in Moscow and drew 200 delegates and 457 guests. 
The assembly founded the Union of Cossacks, elected Ataman A.G. 
Martynov and members of the board, and adopted a statute and an 
appeal to the Cossacks in the country and abroad. According to 
the statute, the Union of Cossacks was proclaimed to be a 
voluntary public association of the representatives of Cossack 
areas, districts, and communities on the basis of common 
socioeconomic, spiritual-cultural, and other interests. The 
historic and spiritual renaissance of the Cossack estate as an 
original ethnic formation was declared to be the main objective. 
Certain contradictions shone through in the principles of 
operations. On one hand, free economic development was 
proclaimed, while on the other hand, private ownership of land 
was rejected. The mandatory nature of Orthodoxy appeared next to 
religious tolerance, and assembly-run democracy--next to the 
restoration of the prerevolutionary status. 
  The formation of the Union of Cossacks inaugurated the 
organizational establishment of the Cossack movement. Within a 
few months, unions and societies were formed locally, primarily 
at the middle level (okrug, kray, oblast). Expansion of the 
chain of primary Cossack structures in cities, rayons, Cossack 
settlements, and hamlets is still underway. The creation of 
Cossack formations on the principle of compatriot communities 
has become characteristic in territories that have never been 
populated by Cossacks and to which they had not been deported on 
a mass scale during Soviet times. In particular, such 
organizations were founded in St. Petersburg, Tula, Voronezh, 
and a number of other cities of the Russian Federation. In Riga, 
the Baltic Cossack Community was formed, which united Cossacks 
from different hosts who by the will of fate ended up in the 
Baltic area. A trend toward interregional unification emerged: 
This was how the Union of Cossacks of the Volga Area and the 
Urals (organizations and communities of 15 oblasts and republics 
of the Russian Federation) appeared. 
  The disintegration of the USSR and the strengthening of 
centrifugal tendencies in Russia, the aggravation of interethnic 
and state-to-state relations on Russia's borders, the overall 
growth of instability and social tension, the growth of the 
anti-Russian sentiment in nearby foreign countries, the ever 
increasing flow of refugees and forced resettlers streaming to 
the territory of Russia from the CIS countries, the need to fill 
the spiritual vacuum that formed after the rejection of 
communist ideology, and the striving of the people to plug into 
some kind of stable community in order to counteract the 
mounting atomization of society may be considered the main 
factors stimulating the growth of Cossack entities. 
  The third stage in the development of the Cossack movement 
(from the end of 1991 to present) has been marked, on one hand, 
by the creation of a state-legal foundation for the renaissance 
of the Cossack estate and, on the other hand, the increasing 
politization of Cossack organizations and an organizational 
split within the movement on ideological and political grounds. 
The Union of Cossack Hosts of Russia was created as the 
successor of the "White" movement to counterbalance the 
"postcommunist" Union of Cossacks. The main differences between 
the two unions in question may be reduced to the following: 
first, their orientation toward differing political forces and, 
as a consequence, differing attitudes toward the policy of the 
Russian authorities: from moderately hostile on the part of the 
Union of Cossacks (SK) to enthusiastic on the part of the Union 
of Cossack Hosts of Russia (SKVR); second, differences in 
interpreting the role of Cossacks in interethnic conflicts: from 
direct involvement in them of SK representatives to the 
orientation toward the need for negotiations on the part of the 
SKVR; third, differing attitudes toward private ownership of 
land: from its negation by the SK to its recognition by the SKVR. 
  The complex processes of division among the Cossacks locally 
can be traced using the Kuban as an example. In addition to the 
largest organization which was the first to appear, the Kuban 
Cossack Rada (ataman V.P. Gromov), the Cossack Host of the Kuban 
(ataman Ye.A. Nagay), the "Russia" Cossack Association of the 
Kuban (ataman V.I. Kayuda), and a number of other, smaller 
organizations have taken shape organizationally and made their 
presence known in the Kuban. Despite the efforts of the leaders 
to consolidate the Cossack movement, which have brought about 
the creation of the Cossack Host of all the Kuban, the main 
confrontation between the Rada and the Cossack Host of the Kuban 
has not been eliminated. The ataman of the latter has ignored 
the unification congress. The differing sociopolitical 
orientation of the organizations, which may be conventionally 
called "statist" and "market-oriented," as well as to a certain 
degree the personal ambitions of their leaders are at the root 
of such divisions. In the political struggle of 1991-1993, the 
Cossack Host of the Kuban (KKV) invariably supported President 
B.N. Yeltsin, the ideas of a Russia united and indivisible, and 
private property. KKV leaders affirm their anticommunism and 
consider themselves the sole successors of the prerevolutionary 
Cossacks of the Kuban. The KKV Statute which was adopted by the 
Grand Assembly on 13 April 1992 proclaims the unification of 
"all progressive Cossack forces" that are interested in bringing 
back the traditional way of life. Orthodoxy is acknowledged to 
be the spiritual foundation of the movement. Taking issue with 
the Rada and its legal successor, the Cossack Host of all the 
Kuban, the KKV Statute codifies collective leadership and 
democratic principles in the structure of the host and 
emphatically advertises the restoration of prerevolutionary 
symbols and forms of governance. 
  The existing split in the Cossack movement testifies to its 
objective sociopolitical and economic nature. The division will 
continue, and will possibly exacerbate in the immediate future. 
It is much more serious, and its roots are far deeper than 
personal enmity between and ambitions of the atamans. No matter 
how desirable it is, the task of the Cossack renaissance will 
continue to be interpreted differently in a society with a sharp 
social stratification and periodic civil wars. As we see it, at 
present efforts should be directed toward mitigating the forms 
of struggle between "Reds" and "Whites" and the prospects for 
unifying positive actions rather than toward searching for an 
illusory unity of "Reds" and "Whites." 
  A genuine rather than superficial perception of Orthodoxy 
may 
become the most important factor in rallying the Cossacks. The 
"Declaration of the Cossack Estate" stressed: "The renaissance 
of the Cossack estate is inconceivable and impossible without 
Church affiliation and away from the bosom of the Church." 
Belonging to the Orthodox religion is becoming one of the 
requirements for anybody joining the movement. At the same time, 
sociologists who have surveyed the world-view principles and 
political orientation of the population of the Kuban have 
concluded that the levels of religious commitment of the Cossack 
and non-Cossack populations differ little. Order, social 
protection, combating crime, and the integrity of Russia are the 
main priorities and ideological planks of the Cossack estate 
that ensure its consolidation. 
  The involvement of Cossack organizations in regional 
conflicts on the territory of the CIS has become a certain 
factor of consolidation, although based on "negative unity." The 
Cossacks perceive themselves as a force capable of defending the 
interests of the Russian-speaking (Slavic) population. This 
perception makes it possible to push internal contradictions 
into the background. First of all, at issue are conflicts 
associated with the lack of correspondence between 
administrative-territorial and ethnic boundaries in the areas 
historically populated by the Cossacks. Thus, the Area of the 
Don Host at present includes parts of Lugansk and Donetsk 
Oblasts of Ukraine and the lands of Volgograd and Voronezh 
Oblasts of the Russian Federation. Rayons in the Stavropol area, 
Karachay-Cherkessia, and Cossack settlements at the Georgian 
border belonged to the Area of the Cossack Host of the Kuban. 
  Two tactics and strategies for settling these conflicts have 
come to the fore within the movement. The supporters of resolute 
and uncompromising measures favor restoration of the status quo 
of 1913. Thus, five republics have now been proclaimed on the 
territory of the former Karachay-Cherkessia Autonomous Oblast 
within Stavropol Kray, of which three are Cossack republics--the 
Batalpasha, Zelenchuk-Urup, and Abaza Republics. Such surges of 
sovereignization hamper the search for compromise solutions 
substantially. The supporters of a moderate course come out for 
taking into account the reality that has come to exist in the 
past decades. They strive to grasp the experience of recent 
years, which has indicated that not only the redistribution of 
territory in and of itself but even a "claim" to such is capable 
of causing unpredictable consequences for all parties. 
  Cossacks are also being drawn into conflicts on the 
territories of other countries. Military formations of Cossacks 
from various regions of the Russian Federation have participated 
in combat actions in the Dniester area, Abkhazia, and on the 
side of the Serbs in Bosnia (according to some data, in 1993 up 
to 300 Cossacks from Russia were there). It is hard to predict 
all the direct, indirect, and remote consequences of the 
participation of Cossack formations in armed conflicts. However, 
we can talk about one thing with a measure of confidence--these 
are the consequences of the accumulation of weapons in the 
regions of traditional Cossack settlement. The existence of 
these weapons and easy access to them draw criminal elements 
into the movement. Their arbitrary and unlawful actions not only 
discredit Cossack organizations in the eyes of the local 
population but frequently bring about serious public clashes. 
  An analysis of the contemporary Cossack movement presupposes 
the meticulous consideration of its real and potential social 
base. Before 1917 the numerical strength of the Cossacks was 
determined quite accurately on the criterion of estate 
affiliation and the requisite legal aspects. However, such an 
estimate is impossible at present. For the last time, 
affiliation with the Cossack estate was noted by the All-Union 
Census of the Population in 1926. A survey taken in August 1992 
by the Monitoring Russian Sociological Service made it possible 
to come up with an approximate estimate of the number of the 
Cossacks in Krasnodar Kray by the method of self-identification 
and outside identification. It comes to approximately 18-27 
percent of the kray population (that is, between 900,000 and 1.3 
million people). This data may be accepted as a working 
hypothesis. The educational level and occupations of the 
Cossacks do not differ from the remainder of the population of 
the Kuban. At the same time, as we see it, a certain 
contradiction exists between the hypothetical number of the 
people who identify themselves with the Cossack estate and the 
real base of Cossack organizations which have so far been unable 
to activate this potential. The degree to which the activities 
of Cossack organizations adequately reflect the interests of the 
reborn community is not clear. In particular, the programmatic 
documents of these organizations include the demand to withdraw 
land traditionally settled by Cossacks from the process of 
privatization. At the same time, 72 percent of Cossacks polled 
in the Kuban came out in favor of the right of Russia's citizens 
to privately own land. For comparison, 59 percent of 
non-Cossacks came out in favor of this. 
  A majority of the population is now quite loyally disposed 
toward the Cossack movement. At the same time, the already 
mentioned poll in Krasnodar Kray registered considerable 
differences in the evaluation of the Cossacks from "within" and 
from "without" this community. The fact that 40 percent of the 
non-Cossacks take a negative view of the rebirth of the Cossack 
estate indicates a source of possible social tension. 
Non-Cossacks frequently view the renaissance of the Cossack 
estate as a random phenomenon (and in some of its 
manifestations--a vaudeville) based on superficial, temporary, 
extraneous factors, and the Cossack estate of our times as an 
"illusory" community. In view of this, it is important that 
regulatory acts of the Russian state devoted to the Cossacks 
stress the impermissibility of infringements of the rights of 
any other group of the population, the reinstatement of estate 
privileges, and the forcible foisting of the Cossack lifestyle 
on citizens. 
  Despite the nonpolitical nature of the movement being 
proclaimed at the first stage of the movement under study, it 
developed from the outset as a sociopolitical organization. The 
Union of Cossacks set forth its programmatic demands in the 
"Declaration of the Cossacks of Russia." Most of its points have 
now been carried out (with the exception of the points on 
exempting the Cossacks from state taxes, including those on 
land, until 1995 and on taking state measures to bring 
administrative-territorial borders into conformity with ethnic 
borders in areas traditionally settled by Cossacks). In 
particular, all acts passed concerning the Cossacks beginning 
1918 have been canceled as illegal with regard to taking 
repressive measures. The rights of the Cossacks to restore the 
traditional social and economic lifestyle and cultural 
traditions and to establish territorial public self-government, 
traditional forms of land use, the restoration of the 
traditional names of inhabited localities and areas, and the 
creation of public associations of Cossacks with historically 
established names have been acknowledged. Obviously, the 
legislative acts were intended not only to do historic justice 
but also to expand the base of support for executive and 
legislative structures in the environment of a crisis of power. 
  The Unification Congress of the Cossack Host of all the 
Kuban 
(October 1992) reflected the sociopolitical evolution of the 
movement: The main principles of the statute were approved, 
amounting to the "assumption by the Cossack organization, which 
had previously been merely sociopatriotic, of the 
responsibilities of a state structure and the impermissibility 
of membership in any political party for Cossacks" (see 
KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI, 28 October 1992). This aspiration was 
expressed in the "Declaration of Cossacks" dated 30 January 
1993, which said that at the present stage the Union of Cossacks 
plays the role of an organizational center which should be 
transformed into a state structure assuming the functions of 
governing the Cossack estate. The ataman of the Union of 
Cossacks, the atamans of troops, regional unions, districts, 
divisions, communities, and Cossack settlements were viewed as 
official representatives of the Cossack estate in the local 
organs of state power. The possible forms of state service by 
Cossacks reflecting their traditions were specified. 
  The above facts indicate that attempts to restrict the 
Cossack movement to a cultural-historic, "folklore" framework 
are unsuccessful. Only a conflict with the power structure may 
result from such attempts. Under present-day conditions, the 
Cossacks are becoming one of the most active and--this is 
particularly significant--most politically organized groups of 
the population.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Bugayev, under rubric "Press </F>
Conference": "New Deputies Being Drawn to the `Center'"] 
  [Text] On 28 December V. Klevtsov, chairman of the Sakhalin 
District Electoral Commission, delivered temporary credentials 
to deputies in the new Russian parliament Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov, 
Mikhail Romanovskiy, and Boris Tretyak. In addition, Klevtsov 
handed over to the deputies the voters' mandates that the 
commission had received. The chief mandate is to do everything 
possible and impossible to preserve civil peace in the country. 
The second is to strengthen legality, and to fight decisively 
and in an uncompromising manner against corruption and organized 
crime. 
  After the ceremonies were over, the deputies answered the 
journalists' questions. 
  Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov thanked the public of Sakhalin Oblast 
for the work that had been done. "Our task," he said, "is to 
represent the population properly in the Federal Assembly. We 
must influence the process of reforms and must make them more 
reasonable, especially when this pertains to shock therapy. 
Currently we are being advised to do more therapy and less 
shock. I am opposed to shock therapy in the Far East. The three 
of us have already met and we have decided to act as a single 
bloc, and in the new parliament we shall try to unite the Far 
East deputies into a single front." 
  Boris Tretyak assured the journalists that he is going to 
Moscow to work, and for him Sakhalin will be in first place. 
  "I am in no hurry to enter any blocs," he said. "For me the 
basic consideration will be the Sakhalin voters." 
  At the same time, after the journalists' direct questions, 
the deputies admitted that they do have definite political 
priorities. For example, Romanovskiy and Tretyak keep more to 
the "center," and they like the Shakhray bloc. But Krasnoyarov 
prefers "Russia's Choice," with one stipulation -- excluding 
from its program the shock therapy for the Far East. 
  Speaking about the future election to the local parliament, 
the oblast's administration head said, "Within a few days I 
shall sign the statute governing elections. We will have to 
create a new organ, consisting of two houses. The lower house -- 
the oblast Duma -- will include 19 persons. Eighteen of them 
will be elected by districts from an equal number of residents. 
One deputy will represent the indigenous nationalities of 
Sakhalin, and he will be elected for a single district -- the 
oblast district. The upper house -- the Oblast Council -- will 
consist of one representative from each rayon." 
  The journalists were also interested in hearing about the 
positions taken by the new people on the political scene, 
Romanovskiy and Tretyak, concerning a serious question -- the 
question of the "northern territories." 
  Replying to this, Boris Tretyak said, "This is a complicated 
question, and we must study it. But if we are talking about 
whether or not to give back the Kuriles, I take a very cautious 
attitude toward the concept of `giving back.' Especially when 
this pertains to Russian land. That which currently exists in 
Russia belongs to Russia, and to Russians. But, to put it 
honestly, I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about the history 
of this question." 
  Mikhail Romanovskiy agreed with his colleague that this is a 
very complicated problem: "I was asked that question frequently 
when I met with the public. Once I gave this answer: Gorbachev 
said that there is no problem, since we won that war. Yeltsin 
said that we should wait 10-15 years and let a younger 
population deal with it. But I think that today we should not 
make this question any larger than it actually is. The country 
is in a complicated economic and political situation. There are 
many national conflicts, and if we give back part of the 
territory this will cause a row. There will be a confrontation 
of forces --leftists, rightists, and others. Therefore we 
currently should give back absolutely nothing -- either in 
Kaliningrad, in Karelia, or on the border with China. We ought 
to wait three or four years and then return to the problem, 
because the problem does exist and should be resolved. 
  "Currently we should invest money in the Kuriles. Otherwise 
the population there will go to Japan, if we do not change the 
attitude to those islands and do not develop them."

<F P=106> [Interview with Alekskey Larionov, by Sergey Saktaganov: </F>
"Zhirinovskiy's Supporters in Sakhalin Have United and Are 
Thinking About Places in the Oblast Parliament"] 
  [Text] In the second half of December, leaflets 
appeared in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, with appeals to Zhirinovskiy 
supporters to create their LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] organization on the island. The organizing body 
consisting of eight people, which includes young workers, 
students, and even one unemployed person, was headed by Aleksey 
Larionov, a 28-year-old watchman at a genetic clinic. On the 
local political scene, as he himself has admitted, he is no 
newcomer: as long ago as the early 1980's he was given 
"prophylactic treatment" by the KGB and removed from the school 
Komsomol organization for having prepared leaflets containing 
excerpts from Voice of America broadcasts. Four years later he 
was an activist in the local organization of DemSoyuz 
[Democratic Union], maintaining contacts also with 
representatives of the NTS (National Labor Union). 
  In and of itself, the conversion of what used to be an 
ultra-democrat into the initiator of the creation of an LDPR 
"cell" appears to be a tremendous political somersault. Because 
literally a few days ago the leader of the previously mentioned 
DemSoyuz, Valeriya Novodvorskaya compared Zhirinovskiy to 
Hitler, and she promised the Russians that, if the Communist 
Party merged with the LDPR, they could expect gas chambers, 
crematoriums, and torture chambers. But what is interesting 
today is not so much a change in the "political face" of one of 
the Sakhaliners, as the immediate plans of Zhirinovskiy's 
supporters on the island. That was specifically the topic of the 
conversation with Aleksey Larionov. 
  [Saktaganov] To begin with, I would like to know what forced 
you to reject so sharply your previous political views. Because, 
judging from the results of the recent election, the same thing 
occurred with many Sakhaliners... 
  [Larionov] My views did not change. The organizations 
changed. And just as I became an anti-Communist in the tenth 
grade, I have remained one. Incidentally, Vladimir Volfovich is 
also an anti-Communist, and during this transitional period it 
is only he who can stop the "Red wave" that is in motion... 
  [Saktaganov] But aren't you embarrassed by the fact that, at 
a party-wide banquet that the political leaders held in Moscow 
to celebrate the election results, Zhirinovskiy ostentatiously 
shook the hand of the "chief" Russian Communist Zyuganov? True, 
he emphasized that this was only "a handshake between Slavs,"but 
it was extremely symbolic... 
  [Larionov] During all these years I realized that politics 
is 
actually dirty business. People do not engage in politics in 
white gloves. If we want to put an end to Communism, this must 
be achieved by democratic means. But from tactical 
considerations it is possible to shake Zyuganov's hand. It is 
also possible today to walk alongside of him in parliament to a 
definite coalition. But the necessity of this kind of alliance 
exists only in the State Duma, where Vladimir Volfovich does not 
have enough votes. In the outlying areas, in the regions, we 
shall not take the step of entering an alliance with the local 
Communist Party organizations, or with this Paramoshkin. 
  We always are well aware that the Communists are our 
enemies. 
When Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the Communists -- if we can 
express it this way -- will be the first to suffer. If they do 
not understand this, this is all the worse for them. 
  [Saktaganov] If it is not a secret, how will they suffer? 
Will they "sit" [that is, be imprisoned]? Will they be given 
"prophylactic treatment," as you were at one time by the KGB? 
  [Larionov] Our leader will decide that. Our job is to carry 
out his orders. But from my point of view it will be necessary 
to take drastic measures. 
  [Saktaganov] If you are a supporter of strict party 
discipline, how do you intend to carry out Vladimir Volfovich's 
policy in the territorial question? After all, Zhirinovskiy, 
speaking, in particular, in Novosibirsk, stated that for him the 
Kurile problem does not exist, and it is very simple to resolve 
the frictions with Japan: just aim the big guns at Japan and 
demand... Hokkaido. Will your organization in Sakhalin boycott 
the Japanese delegations, arm itself with those big guns, and 
protest against humanitarian aid from a neighboring country? 
  [Larionov] I shall say immediately that we shall not arm 
ourselves, because we are supporters of legal methods of taking 
action But, obviously, we shall boycott any Japanese 
representatives and measures with which they are linked. So I 
agree with our leader in his view of the territorial question 
--and not only with regard to Hokkaido or the Kuriles, but also 
with regard to Poland, Finland, and Alaska. First Russia must 
stand on its feet, but the time will come when it will be 
necessary to resolve the question concerning its borders from a 
position of strength. 
  [Saktaganov] Zhirinovskiy have repeatedly stated in public 
that, when he comes to power, all the Jews will be exiled from 
Russia. What is your attitude toward them and, in general, 
people of other nationalities who are living on the territory of 
the oblast? 
  [Larionov] There are two questions here, because it is 
necessary to isolate the Jews from all the other nationalities. 
Vladimir Volfovich is right: they are a people who, by their 
mentality, are committed to world domination. The history not 
only of Russia, but also of all other countries, indicates that 
it is impossible to get along peaceably with this nation, but we 
do not want to take any extreme measures against them. Therefore 
it would be best for themselves if they just leave. 
  As for other nationalities -- the Tatars, for example, or 
the 
Mordvinians -- they must recognize the values of Russia and the 
Russians, and, in that case, they can continue to live here. 
  But there will not be any union republics. There will be 
guberniyas where the local population -- for example, 
Uzbeks -- will have complete cultural autonomy, their own 
language and traditions, but they will also be subjects of the 
Russian empire. 
  [Saktaganov] One of the most brilliant figures among the 
LDPR 
candidates was Kashpirovskiy. Do you also plan to bring into 
your ranks the Sakhalin "extrasensory perceptionists" or people 
who feel that they are somehow linked with cosmic energy 
--followers of yoga, soothsayers, shamans?... 
  [Larionov] It's still too early to talk about this. But I 
feel that, with time, everyone will be with us. Including the 
extrasensory perceptionists, if they prove to be beneficial in 
the political struggle. Incidentally, Kashpirovskiy is doing a 
lot not only for Vladimir Volfovich, but also for the entire 
party... 
  [Saktaganov] What social segments do you plan to rely on in 
our oblast? 
  [Larionov] On all of them except the intelligentsia. 
Vladimir 
Volfovich was right a year ago, when he said that the 
intelligentsia would not understand us. And we put a very low 
evaluation on the intelligentsia, inasmuch as the Russian 
intelligentsia always played a fatal role in our country's 
history. 
  [Saktaganov] I am, of course, somewhat upset by such a stern 
sentence pronounced on the intelligentsia.. But you, as a public 
and political figure, will still have to deal with it. Or at 
least with those journalists. For example, which of the oblast 
newspapers, in your opinion, is close to the LDPR in spirit? 
  [Larionov] The one that is probably closest in spirit is 
GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI. 
  [Saktaganov] What will be your tactics in the 6 March 
election to the oblast parliament? Are there any possible allies 
among the local politicians? 
  [Larionov] First of all we are counting on the ordinary 
people. But we also intend to work with the military and with 
the law-enforcement agencies. But we completely reject the 
current political establishment -- Krasnoyarov, Fedorov, 
Feoktistov, Mikhaylov, etc. 
  If, in January, we succeed in forming an able-bodied 
organization, we shall put our candidates to the oblast 
parliament in contact with the local branch of the Russian 
National Council, where Gennadiy Semenov is the chairman. 
  [Saktaganov] Would you like to take this opportunity to say 
anything to the readers? 
  [Larionov] I would like to thank the Sakhaliners for having 
made this choice. They have proven to be wiser than many 
Russians: our oblast occupies one of the first places with 
regard to the number of votes cast for the LDPR. And I would 
call upon the inhabitants of the island to unite with our 
organization. If possible, I would like you give the telephone 
number where I can be contacted: 3-24-02... 
  [Editor's note] 
  We would like to emphasize immediately that our newspaper 
will never be "close in spirit" to the Zhirinovskiy supporters. 
And the sentence pronounced by them on the Russian 
intelligentsia pertains literally to each of the SVOBODNYY 
SAKHALIN journalists. 
  But, unlike the LDPR activists who are proceeding along the 
path that has already been well-trodden by the 
political-investigation workers -- the path of giving 
"prophylactic treatment" to dissenters and persons of other 
nationalities, we are ready to give the floor to any of the 
political opponents, if, of course, he operates within the 
confines of the law. 
  And there is something else. We hope that the Sakhaliners 
who 
voted for Zhirinovskiy in the recent election, after receiving 
more detailed information about the LDPR, so to speak, 
first-hand, will finally understand precisely what is 
approaching Russia. A person with ears will hear, and a person 
with eyes will see...

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Kolbasyuk: "The Mayor of Moscow Wins </F>
Again: How Yuriy Luzhkov Became a Politician in Spite of 
Himself"] 
  [Text] The mayor of Moscow likes to play soccer. And his 
shirt, which Yuriy Luzhkov would don at games with a Russian 
Government team, would invariably sport the number 9--center 
forward. But last year, as a member of the Political Olympus of 
Russia team, Luzhkov got the number 11. The country's No. 11 
politician in terms of influence--such was the result of a 
survey by the VP Service for the Study of Public Opinion and 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 6 January 1994). 
  No. 11 is an outside forward attacking the rival's goal by 
surprise, from the wing. There was hardly anyone who expected 
that Yuriy Luzhkov, who would invariably take up a position in 
the political backfield, would outrun many people. To judge by 
this rating, Luzhkov has, in fact, become a part of the 
government ring, which will boost or is already boosting his 
political career. 
  In this same NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rating for 1993 Gavriil 
Popov, Yuriy Luzhkov's godfather in politics, came 32d. Yet in 
1989, when the first democratically elected chairman of the 
Moscow City Soviet, who had a resonance throughout the country, 
adopted for the position of chairman of the Executive Committee 
Yuriy Luzhkov, the latter was only head of Moscow's 
Agro-Industrial Committee. He was a typical apparatchik of the 
party-economic mold--a strict and pragmatic leader who was very 
familiar with the municipal economy and knew how to make 
efficient use of the command-administrative system. 
  There came to be talk in the governor general's house on 
Tverskaya at that time that the Moscow City Soviet had acquired 
an old bureaucratic hand. As a connoisseur of the 
command-administrative system, Popov was, of course, acting 
deliberately in appointing as his chief deputy a person from the 
Executive Committee of the times of Grishin and Saykin. He 
understood that Moscow could not be run by a democratic assembly 
of citizen non-gentry intellectuals. And Popov himself, by 
virtue of his stamp of character, had no great desire to busy 
himself with potatoes, street-sweeping, and the water main. The 
communist Luzhkov set about the job. And an old horse makes a 
straight furrow. 
  In the Moscow of perestroyka times Yuriy Luzhkov in the 
office of chairman of the Moscow Agro-Industrial Committee was a 
benefactor of the co-operators since he granted permission for 
their activity. A good many of them had emerged at that time, 
and they rapidly inundated Moscow with fruit and vegetables. But 
their demise was swift, like a ripe plum falling from the 
branch--Saykin, chairman of the Executive Committee at that 
time, strangled the co-operators of all possible stripes with 
various sets of instructions. But many businessmen of this wave 
of enterprise, who had had a chance to get rich, did not forget 
Luzhkov. They are now running finance companies and banks and 
constitute the elite of Russian business. Some of them have 
become personal friends of Yuriy Luzhkov and his political 
capital. 
<H5>  From a Business Manager to a Politician </H5>
  Three years ago Yuriy Mikhaylovich was saying in various 
auditoriums: "I am not a politician, I am a business manager. My 
job is to hold the city together." And, by and large, he has 
succeeded. Luzhkov became Popov's shadow. Democratic circles 
considered him one of them after he in fact opposed the 
Gorbachev government in February 1991 (troops had been brought 
in to Moscow to guard the Congress of People's Deputies of the 
USSR at that time). The leadership of the capital permitted a 
protest demonstration, and the Moscow militia protecting the 
demonstrators was led by Yuriy Luzhkov personally. 
  The balance of power in the city gradually shifted to 
Luzhkov's corner office on Tverskaya with a view of the Yuriy 
Dolgorukoy monument and the Kremlin (Luzhkov still uses this 
office, incidentally, although he has in an official sense grown 
at least two levels)--the chairman of the Executive Committee 
has become a most influential figure. With every passing day 
Luzhkov acquired more power. At meetings of the Executive 
Committee he would "publicly flay" officials of the city 
administration and teach business managers how to operate and 
even sack them. There were few who came in for any praise here, 
and there were unkind, cutting words for everyone. But there was 
no grumbling since Luzhkov's command style was more 
comprehensible and kinder to the authorities than the clamorous 
sittings of the Moscow City Soviet. 
  On 12 June 1991 Moscow elected not only the president of 
Russia but its first mayor also. Popov and Luzhkov (he acquired 
the title of vice mayor) amassed the most votes. The Executive 
Committee came to be called city hall, and the Executive 
Committee Presidium, the government, and Luzhkov become, in 
addition, premier of the Government of Moscow. 
  Diarchy, which predetermined the similar development of 
events at a higher level, set in in the capital (still of the 
USSR at that time). But Popov and Luzhkov seized the initiative 
immediately--on the eve of the elections even all retirees were 
by decision of the former granted the possibility of free travel 
on municipal transport. This social trump card in the 
Popov-Luzhkov policy became one of the main ones, and 
Muscovites' affections remained on the side of city hall through 
the termination of the existence of the Moscow City Soviet. 
  Yuriy Luzhkov was, as before, in the shadow of the democrat 
mayor. Luzhkov greatly respected him as a scholar and idolized 
him even. When the vice mayor began to talk about economics, it 
could be seen that the influence of Popov the economist on 
Luzhkov had been enormous. But at the same time it was felt that 
a resistance to these ideas was maturing in him, a resistance 
born of the "actual economy" with which Luzhkov had to deal 
every day--from morning until night. 
  Popov had it figured right. Luzhkov proved to be a workhorse 
capable of tackling business all day long. He did not succumb to 
despair, became involved in everything, and could calmly and 
knowledgeably argue about the difficulties of the "zero" cycle 
in construction, then smoothly switch to the process of the 
manufacture of stuffing for sausages, and conclude the 
conversation with a discussion of binder-type asphalt. Yuriy 
Luzhkov would frame each subject with actual figures, and you 
would believe him, although he has never prepared asphalt or dug 
a foundation pit. 
  He would sharply cut short talk about politics. He would 
knit 
his brows, feeling himself to be not entirely at ease. He would 
take pride in the fact that he is a man "of the soil," a 
business manager, and he would, as he put it, leave "all the 
chattering" to the deputies. But August 1991 threw the 
"winter-swimmer" Luzhkov into the cold font of world politics. 
  On 24 August USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev formed the 
provisional Council of Ministers of the USSR-Committee for 
Operational Management of the Economy. Under the leadership of 
Ivan Silayev, Luzhkov was entrusted with tackling questions of 
the agro-industrial complex, trade, foreign economic relations, 
and the social sphere. In practice this meant that Yuriy Luzhkov 
was to secure from all the republics and krays of the 
disintegrating Union supplies of agricultural products for the 
"granary of the motherland" and on the strength of talk about an 
acceleration of the development of democracy in the USSR obtain 
from the West soft loans for purchases of that same food. As in 
1987 also, almost the impossible was demanded of Luzhkov: 
feeding the people by employing command-socialist methods of 
management. What he did was there for all to see: in the store, 
on the table. 
  The enthusiasm with which Yu. Luzhkov embarked on this work 
astonished many apparatchiks in the Council of Ministers. It was 
thought that he would break his neck. But ministerial office 
afforded Luzhkov, who had in the Moscow Agro-Industrial 
Committee been accustomed to extricating himself from almost 
hopeless situations, merely operating room for his seething 
energy. 
  Luzhkov's name appeared in all major European newspapers 
along with those of leading politicians and businessmen. 
Following a conversation with Luzhkov and Yavlinskiy, Pierre 
Beregovoy, minister of economy, finance, and budget of France at 
that time, said that the course of history in the USSR had 
accelerated markedly. Following a visit to Warsaw, a most 
important barter deal was concluded: Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy 
chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, did not conceal 
his satisfaction at the fact that in exchange for 600,000 tonnes 
of potatoes, 50,000 tonnes of apples, and 20,000 tonnes of 
onions, his country would receive 1.5 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas. Yuriy Luzhkov himself was sober in his evaluation 
of what had been done: "Yes, we could have obtained foreign 
currency somewhere for this raw material. We are proceeding here 
primarily from economic considerations. Poland is our closest 
neighbor. Food supplies in terms of transportation costs account 
for up to 15 percent and even more of the cost of the products, 
but transportation costs are not that great here, and we benefit 
from this." 
  The principle of expediency helped Luzhkov on several other 
occasions to accomplish the tasks that had been heaped on him. 
Sometimes this principle was dominant in the affairs of the vice 
mayor, and decisions that were stillborn issued from his pen at 
that time. But simple steps helped Luzhkov in the fall of 1991. 
  It is possible that Yu. Luzhkov's ability to negotiate with 
potential partners was manifested in that same period. 
Secretaries from the United States and Canada would come to 
Moscow on reconnaissance, promising nothing, but subsequently, 
at their direction, representatives of various companies, who 
would subsequently take up residence in Moscow, would come to 
Luzhkov, as a person capable of getting things done. Luzhkov 
knows how to persuade people, and they believe him. Following a 
visit to Brussels, to the headquarters of the Common Market, the 
vice mayor acknowledged that there had been very difficult 
negotiations on supplies of food to the USSR both along 
humanitarian assistance lines and along the lines of prompt 
credit agreements, "which are to be signed very soon." The 
humanitarian assistance reached the country, there were other 
supplies also--Luzhkov had not been cheated. 
  But some of the agreements gradually fell through as a 
consequence of the West's reluctance to give money to the USSR, 
now Russia. This was one of Luzhkov's first contacts with the 
bureaucracy of the West. 
  He did everything he could and calmly returned to his office 
on Tverskaya with a view of the Kremlin and the Yuriy Dolgorukoy 
monument: There was no starvation in the country--Luzhkov was 
able to persuade and convince even the Union republics that had 
already proclaimed their independence to fulfill the agreement 
on reciprocal food supplies. 
  It was in his office on Tverskaya that Luzhkov greeted also 
the Belovezha Agreement, which undermined the political part of 
the vice mayor's work. Everything had to be started all over 
again. 
<H5>  Yeltsin Once More </H5>
  In 1992 Yuriy Luzhkov, author of the book "72 Hours of 
Agony. 
August 1991. Beginning and End of the Communist Putsch in 
Russia," continued to be politicized, in spite of his desire not 
to become involved in politics. He understood sooner than 
Yeltsin what was meant by opposition of the authorities when 
deputies of the Moscow City Soviet began to say that all evil 
resided in the capital's government. Luzhkov made no move to 
exacerbate relations. And in this connection also spoke 
absolutely specifically--the contradictions were of an objective 
nature. They were caused by the imperfection of the legislative 
base. As a democratic society based on the rule of law was 
built, these contradictions would disappear. That is, if the 
Moscow City Soviet got in the way, it would soon disappear. Time 
has shown that Luzhkov acted wisely: he entered via his deputies 
into rearguard battles with the radical democrats and pulled 
over the most clear-headed deputies into the machinery of 
government. Luzhkov-Popov proteges were already holding 
important city positions at this time: Yevgeniy Savostyanov, 
chief of the Moscow department of the Ministry of Security of 
the Russian Federation, and Arkadiy Murashev, chief of the 
city's Internal Affairs Main Administration. Luzhkov himself, on 
the other hand, had begun to fight the Gaydar government. 
Primarily the methods of privatization propounded by chief 
privatizer Chubays. 
  Luzhkov disliked the fact that wholesale privatization would 
deprive city hall of a large chunk of property. And this, in 
Luzhkov's opinion, was wrong: He remained, as before, a 
supporter of gradual entry into the market. 
  In the old prices the property of city hall (and this means 
40,000 buildings, transport, hospitals, schools, plants, and so 
forth) was valued at R125 billion. Luzhkov, as a true Russian 
fellow, has no wish to let anything out of his hands just like 
that. And he had by his grasp achieved a great deal--a 
wide-ranging social program had been initiated in the city. 
  On 6 June 1992 Gavriil Popov--Moscow's first democrat 
mayor--resigned, and Yeltsin immediately appointed Luzhkov head 
of the city. The president of Russia did not have to think long 
when signing the edict, for that matter. He remembered how in 
1987 Luzhkov had, as directed by B. Yeltsin, first secretary of 
the Moscow City Party Committee, taken charge of the 
Agro-Industrial Committee and had done a good job. 
<H5>  Yuriy Luzhkov as City Planner </H5>
  City planning is one of Luzhkov's passions. No, he does not 
demolish roadways to build stone monuments. Yuriy Mikhaylovich 
erects churches and apartment houses. When, at the end of last 
year, the Chapel of the Icon of Our Lady of Kazan was opened in 
Red Square, the mayor stood next to the president and was 
inordinately proud of his creation. It was on his insistence 
that the Government of Moscow began the elaboration of a program 
of church revival and reconstruction. It is possible that at the 
start of the next millennium people will once again be speaking 
of Moscow as the city of "multitudes," and Luzhkov himself will 
be inscribed in tablets of stone under the name of Yuriy the 
Chapel Builder, although it is not absolutely clear why there 
will be so many churches in Moscow in the 21st century. 
  It is hard to believe in Luzhkov's piety, but on grand 
church 
holidays he can always be found among the parishioners of the 
Yelokhovskiy Cathedral. The mayor has not been spotted in a 
synagogue or mosque. But since he ordered the erection of a 
synagogue and mosque in Victory Park on Poklonnaya gora 
alongside the Christian chapel, Luzhkov may be considered a 
postcommunist ecumenist. Luzhkov gave R50,000 of his own, which 
he had received from the judgment against the newspaper PRAVDA, 
for the building of the chapel in Red Square. 
  Luzhkov cannot be reproached with a patriarchal approach or 
"sour" conservatism. He found his own path to the 
chapel--objective reality present in cubic meters of building 
materials--and walked it with the secret thought of praying for 
forgiveness for nomenklatura sins and of leaving behind fond 
memories of himself. What prompts people to take this path is 
depicted well by Russian literature of the turn of the 20th 
century. 
  During a church service the appearance of our mayor holding 
a 
candle makes a dual impression. He is either quailing at the 
sight of Byzantine splendor in the adornment of the cathedral, 
when the choir hits so high a note that you yourself are 
uplifted a little, or Yuriy Mikhaylovich is bored. The 
reconciled nature of the atmosphere shrouds and enfeebles, and 
this is none too comfortable a state for Luzhkov's active 
nature. On the way out from the chapel he is probably thinking 
what still needs to be built, restructured, and so forth. He is 
aided in such work by a sound knowledge of the historical and 
urban-planning distinctiveness of Moscow and his ability to 
attract private capital for the reconstruction of buildings in 
the center. And he promises, furthermore, that 250,000 
Muscovites who are residents of the center will return to their 
homes after their reconstruction. This will hardly be possible, 
but on a historical scale this fact is immaterial. 
  The second direction of the activity of the city 
planner-mayor "for the ages" is to be the erection of 
ultra-modern skyscrapers like the Moscow City international 
business center. The first billion has already been invested, 
but there is, as before, still a garbage tip in the bend of the 
Moscow River. Luzhkov himself has not made it here yet, 
evidently. 
<H5>  Corruption in Moscow </H5>
  Moscow received the news of Luzhkov's appointment as mayor 
without any particular joy. There was talk to the effect that 
now all documents exposing officials of city hall of theft and 
bribery would be destroyed. The principal unmaskers of the mafia 
accused Luzhkov of all mortal sins, but then all at once fell 
silent since the facts they had presented were not corroborated. 
There had been similar assaults on Yuriy Luzhkov in the period 
when he stood behind Gavriil Popov. At that time Luzhkov wrote 
letters to the papers and appeared on television, proving his 
cleanness. 
  Having become mayor, he started to go to law. And it has to 
be acknowledged that no one has been able to prove that Luzhkov 
is a thief or bribe-taker--the mayor has not lost a single case. 
This has strongly added, if not to the popularity, then to the 
respect for Yuriy Mikhaylovich. 
  A new twist was added to the spiral of the 
nonprofessional-democratic "fight against corruption" following 
the founding of the notorious MVK (Interdepartmental Commission 
for the Fight Against Corruption Under the President of the 
Russian Federation). According to confidential information, not 
officially reflected anywhere, at the time of the feverish 
collection of compromising material on the enemies of Boris 
Yeltsin, activists of the MVK dragged out and heaped onto the 
president's desk some things concerning Moscow. A person who saw 
all this said that the president responded in a somewhat 
irritated tone of voice, cutting the conversation short: "Leave 
Moscow alone." Or something to that effect. 
  Looking into this incident in the Kremlin, we may say the 
following: Like any important superior, Luzhkov signs many 
documents, sometimes hardly familiarizing himself with them 
even, trusting his aides. On a purely formal level certain 
complaints could, most likely, be brought against Luzhkov, but, 
first, there would still have to be proof here, and, second, 
Luzhkov, as an experienced bureaucrat, senses danger in his 
bones. It is known for certain that when a powerful new 
commercial group attempted to blackmail the mayor with the fact 
that it could prove its lobbying activity to this firm's 
advantage, Luzhkov sent them further down the line, 
demonstrating here that the mayor's signature has never been 
appended to papers of dubious content. So the young wolves 
snapped their teeth on the neck of the experienced industrial ox. 
<H5>  The Mayor and the Balalaika </H5>
  Yuriy Luzhkov is a man of the world. And his bowtie is an 
eloquent indication of this. The mayor attends secular 
receptions not from a sense of duty. He likes also to circulate 
in the company of stars of the theater of the first and second 
magnitudes, likes to hobnob with famous directors and 
scriptwriters, and likes to appear on stage. His effervescent 
nature cannot pass up the temptation to compose and deliver 
pompous toasts and odes. Listening to Yuriy Mikhaylovich at the 
Mark Zakharov birthday party, democratic intellectuals yawned 
from boredom, but, to judge by everything, they were enveloped 
by a sense of pride that the capital's mayor hangs around 
museums and makes himself over to them 
wholeheartedly--particularly when a specific problem needs to be 
resolved. At that same party Yuriy Luzhkov took to the stage 
with a balalaika (a gift to the birthday honoree) and began to 
read his poem dedicated to Zakharov. At this time a cake was 
carried out in back of the mayor and candles were lit in the 
expectation that the mayor was on the point of concluding the 
ode and kissing the birthday celebrant and that the latter, thus 
inspired, would blow out the candles at one go. But Luzhkov, 
rapping out his words, went on and on, speaking in rhyme: the 
candles had burned out, and new ones had to be stuck in. In the 
televised version this episode was by the solicitous hand of the 
director reduced to one quatrain, and the result was that 
Luzhkov was brief also, like Sobchak, whose speech was 
reproduced in full. 
<H5>  A Good Deputy Is a Satisfied Deputy </H5>
  The deputies of the State Duma of Russia spent almost a week 
discussing the question of how they were to live at public 
expense, executing the wishes of the people. As you will recall, 
the new councilmen did not short-change themselves. The deputies 
of the Moscow City Duma were not offended either, but their 
benefactor was Yuriy Luzhkov himself. Part of the machinery of 
state was assigned to each deputy (and there are 35 of them 
altogether), and good apartments are now being sought on the 
quiet for the people's elect. 
  It is for this reason, perhaps, that there have been no rows 
in the City Duma and that Moscow's councilmen, wholly dependent 
on the mayor, but with no grounds for complaints about lack of 
attention to them, are working productively. They voted the 
deficit budget with which Luzhkov had presented them and gave 
him carte-blanche for its execution. By this simple method Yuriy 
Luzhkov restored working order in the law-making body and 
secured his rear. And in the building on Petrovka, where the 
Duma meets, renovation is under way currently in order that the 
deputies might in the future also look into the city's problems 
calmly and comfortably and avoid damaging democratic urges. 
<H5>  Reforms Luzhkov-Style </H5>
  Luzhkov understands the market economy and democratic 
transformations somewhat in his own way, although he always 
follows the route of purely presidential policy. Not government, 
presidential. It is said that it was the mayor of Moscow who 
said: Between democracy and the market we choose the market. 
Luzhkov has his own economic strategy, therefore: a market 
subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities, the payment of 
social benefits to those who cannot earn sufficient themselves, 
and the extraction from commercial structures of resources 
necessary for the city, but also the opening for them of the 
opportunity to develop business and, consequently, get rich. 
  Luzhkov is even more radical than the president on certain 
political issues. Last winter, when the rights of the 
Russian-speaking population came to be violated in Latvia and 
Estonia, the Moscow mayor was the first to declare that, were 
this to go on, all agreements between the Government of Moscow 
and these countries could be annulled. The Russian Government, 
and the president also, took a slap in the face. 
  The president remained silent when Luzhkov decided to 
introduce registration conditions for residence in Moscow last 
March. This innovation did not get through the first time--the 
Moscow City Soviet, the Supreme Soviet, and the Public 
Prosecutor's Office rebelled. 
  But October 1993 was the mayor's shining hour. The 
regulations were put into effect during the state of emergency. 
And Moscow was engulfed in a wave of xenophobia. Luzhkov was 
victorious, playing the part of defender of Russian people. In 
the minds of citizens not burdened by politics, the mayor's 
action made a pleasing impression. Luzhkov did not justify 
himself and did not repent, in public at least, nor did he 
retreat from his position. 
  Having learned how to maneuver in current political life, 
the 
mayor has always tried to play his own, even if little, game. 
And the presidential-government team could not put the squeeze 
on him, afraid of Yeltsin, obviously. For the latter Luzhkov has 
been a person capable of performing any work and keeping a firm 
hold on Moscow--more than the capital, the political and 
"psychological" heart of Russia. 
  On 23 July of last year the Supreme Soviet of the Russian 
Federation Sixth Session authorized the institution of criminal 
proceedings against V. Shumeyko. Everyone anticipated a noisy 
scandal. It was rumored that, following the Supreme Soviet's 
demand for the dismissal of the mayor of Moscow also, Luzhkov 
would be sent as ambassador to Canada, out of harm's way. That 
same day Luzhkov, wearing a light-gray suit, mounted the 
Congress podium and said, rapping out each word: "Just you try. 
It was not you who put me there. It is not your job to remove me 
either." After this, the popularity of the mayor of the capital 
went through the roof. 
  There has come to be talk as of late in the offices in 
Staraya ploshchad about Luzhkov as a candidate for the office of 
president. This talk has intensified even more since the victory 
of the LDPR at the parliamentary elections. Yuriy Mikhaylovich 
himself has not supported this talk, responding that he is 
indifferent to such rumors. 
  He has rejected the struggle for the position of Duma deputy 
or member of the Federation Council, which he could not have 
lost, realizing that this would be of no interest to him and 
unnecessary now also. In addition, Luzhkov knows that there is 
nothing as powerful in Russia as the administrative vertical 
line. In tsarist, communist, and postcommunist Russia. A 
pragmatist with a flexible intellect, he sees for himself as yet 
no place other than that of mayor of the capital affording him 
the power to influence the domestic policy of all of Russia and 
the CIS even, especially since this office and his personal 
connections are helping him become a person who is well informed 
as to presidential-governmental court intrigues. So Luzhkov has 
become a clean politician, although such a definition seems 
altogether strange. 
  The "cleanliness" of Moscow's streets is of no significance 
here owing to the smallness of its magnitude. No one notices 
this when against the background of the industrial recession the 
capital's construction workers have handed over 3 million square 
meters of housing, of which 1 million have been given free of 
charge--to persons on the waiting list. A political step of 
Luzhkov's was a slap at the falling Gaydar by an open letter to 
Chernomyrdin. It dealt with preferences for Moscow in the 
acquisition of food. The monetarists had prevented this. It is, 
generally, all the same to Luzhkov which economic theory is 
currently in vogue: He has to feed the capital. 
  Luzhkov is a person who adapts well to all conditions of 
life, for he always tackles very specific assignments and (which 
is rarely the case with others) knows how to accomplish them. 
<H5>  Moscow Rumors </H5>
  The capital's rumors from the highest spheres may be 
evaluated by the old words "all calendars lie," but they should 
not, undoubtedly, be ignored, for all that, since a computation 
of them affords a depth of understanding of the processes at 
work in the Kremlin's offices. As the POSTFAKTUM Agency reported 
recently, three big-capital entrepreneurial parties will shortly 
make their presence known. The constituent congress of one of 
them--Party of the Third Estate--is scheduled for 15 February. 
The purpose of the newly formed structure is nomination by the 
end of this year of Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov as candidate 
for the office of president. 
  So all will very soon become clear. But it is perfectly 
obvious that in the last week of January Yuriy Luzhkov 
consolidated his positions, taking eighth place in the "100 
Politicians" popularity poll, and his latest slap at Gaydar hit 
home: At a meeting in Orel, Chernomyrdin allocated Luzhkov the 
necessary credit for the purchase of food in the capital. 
Luzhkov wins again.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Attempts To Solve the Housing </F>
Problem Are Being Made Through Private Construction"] 
  [Text] Moscow's government is taking very uncommon steps in 
trying to cut down, at least somewhat, the number of persons on 
the housing waiting list. As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS found out, 
the Northeast Administrative Okrug has begun an unusual 
experiment to introduce a new form of cooperation in housing 
construction. 
  The idea of this experiment is that persons on the list who 
do not want to wait endlessly for housing may organize 
themselves into collectives and seek investors or organizations 
which may want to undertake the construction of housing units. 
An indispensable condition for this kind of construction is that 
the investor must allocate 50 percent of the living space to 
persons on the housing waiting list. 
  Persons on the waiting list will look for housing 
construction areas themselves and will have to coordinate their 
activities only with the local prefecture. 
  If this experiment proves successful, this kind of 
construction cooperation will take place in every part of Moscow.

<F P=106> Article by E. Shlyakhtina: "Continuing To Rob the Press and </F>
Subscribers, Moscow's Postal Authorities Have Increased the Cost 
of Delivering Newspapers by More Than Threefold"] 
  [Text] During a recent regularly scheduled round table 
discussion, journalists from our newspaper and other interested 
parties were discussing the problem of newspaper distribution. A 
certain very important person from a ministry, "who had the 
scholarly look of someone who knows," summarized the views, 
worries, and outright alarm of subscribers who have been 
helpless in the face of the market environment that had intruded 
into their lives: "A subscription is a blessing for everyone. 
Subscribers are guaranteed each issue; the post office receives 
money up front, which they can use; and the publisher has 
permanent readers." It is wonderful that these words are so 
idyllic, that "everything is so good, oh, beautiful marquise." A 
subscription is a good thing. It exists now and will exist 
forever. In actual fact, however, the picture that emerges is 
not so radiant. 
  Excessive and openly larcenous tariffs, constantly 
implemented by postal and telecommunications officials, are--as 
they say--chopping down publications at their roots and even 
without all this, choking to death the subscriber who can barely 
make ends meet. As everyone knows, for a long time the cost of 
delivery has been higher than the cost of the newspapers 
themselves. Publishers have been forced to make an incredible 
effort, at times engaging in commercial, rather than creative 
activities, so that the subscriber would not suffer. Let us 
remind you that in the subscription campaign that just ended, 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA offered its readers a half year subscription 
for only 600 rubles at a time when the post office announced a 
nearly fourfold increase in the price of newspaper delivery. We 
shall not even speak about the postal and telecommunications 
workers around Moscow, who--as everyone knows--presented a 
figure that was totally unthinkable, as a result of which the 
publication office was again forced to place 3,000 rubles in an 
account for postal and communications employees on behalf of 
each suscriber around Moscow. This came at a time when newspaper 
production cost the publisher several hundred million rubles per 
month. Why, then, do some publishers look for and find sources 
of revenue, while others just hope that those who are not yet 
losing money will be "taken" the next time. Can ads be published 
endlessly, using sponsors' money? 
  What is the solution? First of all, it probably would be 
worth looking in detail at the calculations; that is, seeing 
exactly what is included in postal expenses for this new 
six-month period. In particular, are the wages justified for 
postal carriers, who incidentally have stopped delivering mail 
in afternoons and evenings and have only one morning delivery, 
and even that one is not done the way it should be. As of 
February 1st, a postman's pay will be somewhat higher than that 
of a physician, a scientist, or an artist, whose work is no less 
important, and whose work, of course, takes many hours more 
than--for example-- a postman's job. It also would not hurt to 
clarify whether, as a hedge against future increases, funds have 
been allocated for new delivery prices. That move would be a 
barrier to postal and communications workers' ability to carry 
on at least some kind of commercial activity as soon as we start 
living according to the laws of the market economy. Prices just 
cannot be increased practically every three months for using the 
same post office box, nor can postage prices be drastically 
increased, especially since no additional effort has been 
expended and delivery of mail has not been speeded up, but on 
the contrary, slowed down. 
  The main point is, however, that as long as we pattern our 
present lives exclusively on civilized states that we consider 
models of capitalism, we should not forget that in those 
developed and flourishing states the postal system is a 
government service and is protected in every respect by the 
governments of those states. In actuality, no matter what one 
says, the postal service also fulfills a social function in our 
country by helping people attain their constitutional right to 
know about everything that is going on in the world. 
  It would be unjust to assert that no one in Moscow 
understands this. Let us remind you only of the generous impulse 
of the mayor's office, which clearly foresaw the threat of a 
drastic decrease in the number of newspaper issues published in 
Moscow and presented the Moscow Post Office with a subsidy of 
100 million rubles. It is true, of course, that the postal and 
communications workers had to "squeeze" this money out bit by 
bit; nevertheless, the fact is that they received it. Also there 
was the order given last March by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy 
premier of the Moscow government, charging the Directorate of 
Pricing Policy to look into price increases by the Moscow Post 
Office of the State Postal Service for delivering periodicals. 
In addition, he also asked the Finance Department to resolve the 
issue of subsidized expenses for delivering newspapers during 
the second half of last year by taking into consideration the 
inflation factor. 
  Today it is still essential to subsidize our capital's 
postal 
service, which has been degraded to the same level as the trade 
and banking business. If it is not subsidized, in the end all 
the readers of Moscow's newspapers will suffer because of the 
intolerably excessive financial burden that they will have to 
bear.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Isayev: "Have We Elected the Wrong People </F>
Again?"] 
  [Text] Only 10 percent of St. Petersburg's residents are 
fairly well pleased with the current makeup of the State Duma. 
Furthermore, those who did not take part in electing its members 
are even less satisfied with them. It would seem that they have 
no cause to complain: they got the individuals for whom they 
voted. But in our opinion that is too superficial an 
explanation. Without going into the issue in detail here, let us 
simply note the following: if the election were held right now 
only 75 percent of those who went to the polls on 12 December 
would vote the same way again, 14 percent would vote 
differently, and 11 percent are unsure how they would vote now. 
  All things change, but we are going to have to travel with 
the current Russian parliament for quite some time and in an 
unknown direction. In light of that St. Petersburg residents' 
assessment of the election success of one of the Duma's key 
players -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- is very curious. Of all 
voters in St. Petersburg only 9 percent are of the opinion that 
his success event will help improve the state of affairs in 
Russia. The same percentage is also found among those who 
actually voted. Yet their numbers should be significantly larger 
(recall that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia won 17 
percent of the vote in St. Petersburg). Can it be that these 
people are now free of his spell? 
  At this time it is difficult to answer that question. We are 
still seeing the phenomenon of respondents' cunning evasion of 
answers to direct questions such as: "Did you personally vote 
for Zhirinovskiy?" As this phenomenon was first detected during 
pre-election polls of public opinion and also cropped up in 
polls taken the day of the election, it cannot be attributed to 
a reaction by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
supporters to the storm of revelations about the Liberal 
Democrat leader after 12 December (one scenario that has been 
offered: many people have had their eyes opened and are now 
ashamed to admit their political shortsightedness). 
  St. Petersburg residents' attitudes toward the prospect of 
the current Cabinet of Ministers receiving a vote of no 
confidence appear to be quite undetermined. It seems the issue 
has lost some of its urgency for the time being. 
  As for the personal ratings of current and former members of 
the government, it turns out that the politicians who are 
leaving the scene have a higher degree of public support than 
the ones who remain.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Tyaginryadno: "Scandal: Time To Pack Their </F>
Bags"] 
  [Text] Even though the latest convocation of the 
Leningrad Oblast Soviet was dissolved more than two months ago, 
scandals involving its deputies continue. Even now the oblast 
administration (which has succeeded in becoming the oblast 
government in the interim) is unsuccessfully attempting to evict 
several former elected representatives from their official 
apartments in St. Petersburg. 
  Eleven apartments at 10 Yakhtennaya Street were made 
available to deputies by a decision of the oblast soviet on 4 
September 1991. They were intended for elected officials working 
for the oblast soviet on a full-time basis and residing 
permanently in the oblast. As noted in the decision, which was 
signed by Mr. Yarov, this was intended to be temporary official 
housing. Thus it was assumed that during their period of service 
as deputies the deputies' own housing would be reserved for them. 
  After the oblast soviet completed its activities on 16 
November it was time for the now-unemployed deputies to go back 
home. That is the oblast administration's opinion. However, 
according to Mikhail Simanov, chief legal consultant in the 
oblast government's legal department, some of the former 
deputies continue to occupy apartments in St. Petersburg and 
refuse to give them up, basing that position on various 
circumstances of a personal nature. As of this time the oblast 
government has lodged claims against six former oblast soviet 
deputies: Aleksey Vaskov, Oleg Mokhov, Lyudmila Katushonok, 
Nikolay Shalonin, Nina Goroshchenko and Svetlana Belyayeva (the 
rest have either vacated the apartments after all or else remain 
in them on terms satisfactory to the administration). 
  It appears that the administration does not intend to do any 
favors for the deputies, with whom it is commonly known not to 
have the most amicable relations. After oral negotiations and 
attempts to find a compromise solution produced no results, the 
deputies were sent an official letter, in which they and the 
members of their family were directed to vacate their official 
housing within one month. That deadline expires a few days from 
now. It is a possibility that soon there will be a sensational 
trial -- the administration is preparing to go to court to 
demand the forcible eviction of the former deputies from their 
official apartments, an action of which the latter were warned 
in the aforementioned letter. 
  The apartments are not the only object of disagreement 
between the oblast government and the former deputies. It seems 
that many of Leningrad Oblast's elected officials are attempting 
to derive the maximum benefit from their present situation. 
Tomorrow Smolninskiy Rayon Court will begin trying another case. 
This time the deputies have filed 18 lawsuits against the 
administration simultaneously, insisting that they were fired 
from their jobs with the soviet in violation of proper legal 
procedure.

"All Branches of Government Are Equal, but Some Are More Equal 
Than Others: Anatoliy Sobchak Limits Powers of St. Petersburg's 
Future Lawmakers"] 
  [Text] After successfully eliminating the St. Petersburg 
City Soviet at year's end and along with it dual government in 
the city, now-unchallenged city hall has set about creating a 
new alliance of powers in a form understood by Mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak. An amendment to the presidential edict "A Statute on 
the System of Organs of State Authority in St. Petersburg" 
drafted by city hall in essence means that the future assembly 
intended to replace the former soviet will not greatly trouble 
the existence of the executive branch. 
  Elected for a two-year term, it will be comprised of 50 
deputies working on a part-time basis. The city parliament's 
functions will be limited to approving the budget and 
establishing legal standards. The mayor will be head of St. 
Petersburg's government and will be granted the right to 
independently appoint and fire the heads of the city's organs of 
state authority. 
  The documents do not set forth any procedures for 
impeachment 
of the head of the city administration, yet they set forth in 
detail a statute on dissolution of the city assembly. 
Incidentally, the assembly may also dissolve itself -- and all 
that requires is a simple majority of deputies, whereas 
overturning a mayoral veto will require a vote of at least 
two-thirds of the full membership. A two-thirds majority will 
also be required to reject an amendment made by the mayor to any 
of the deputies' draft legislation -- otherwise the amendment 
automatically becomes part of the law. 
  The assembly may hand down a decision of no confidence in a 
public official -- but only in cases of flagrant violation of 
the Russian Constitution or Russian law, or violation of 
government decrees and the city's own legal acts. As in all 
cases pertaining to city hall, decisions in such cases will 
require a two-thirds majority vote from the deputies. Even in 
better days the St. Petersburg City Soviet could barely bring 
together a quorum (50 percent of its full membership), so it 
seems quite improbable that the new city assembly will be able 
to convene the appropriate number of deputies every time. 
  After curtailing the powers of the yet-to-be-established 
city 
parliament, the mayor then enacted a statute on elections to the 
St. Petersburg City Assembly, which are slated for 20 March 
1994. Assembly elections will take place in a single round of 
voting. There will be a five-year term limit on elected 
representatives, as well as a ban on participation in municipal 
elections by so-called "non-citizens" of the Russian Federation 
(of which there are officially approximately 1,000 in St. 
Petersburg). 
  Particularly notable is a passage which states that all 
unspent money from campaign funds, associations and candidates 
will be turned over to the city budget after the election 
campaign is over. Therefore on the eve of the election one 
should expect massive attempts by candidates to spend their 
campaign money before it leaves their hands -- including the 
traditional idea of throwing a big party with the "leftovers."

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Arkhipov, reporting from St. Petersburg: </F>
"The Mayor Was Annoyed and Issued a Manifesto"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg promises to break the new 
custom of not paying attention to elections to local governing 
bodies. The provincial modesty for which even elections to the 
Moscow Duma were noted apparently does not suit the city on the 
Neva. 
  The campaign for 50 seats on the City Assembly, which 
operates on a "volunteer basis," meets once a week and is only 
entrusted with the functions of a representatives' club, has 
produced an unexpected burst of political activity. Every party, 
movement and ideology will be represented in the election -- no 
one has decided not to participate or to declare a boycott. 
  This activity was mainly inspired by the city 
administration, 
which laid down playing rules that are acceptable to a majority 
of political organizations. The "sound and fury" of Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobchak, despondent over the Russian Democratic Reform 
Movement's poor showing in the December election, and the 
audacity with which jurist Sobchak handles constitutional 
standards, have really gotten the city's political circles 
excited. For example, the Election Statute approved by the mayor 
denies the right to vote to St. Petersburg's 100,000 students, 
cadets, military personnel and citizens who have not met the 
"residency requirement" (something not envisioned by the 
Constitution), and candidates must be at least 21 years old 
instead of 18! An amendment to the Election Statute that was 
released on 22 January finally convinced everyone that the mayor 
is capable of "extrapolating" constitutional law ad 
infinitum. Now suddenly one finds the caveat that deputies 
from both the State Duma and the Federation Council may not be 
elected to serve in the City Assembly! 
  It is no secret that this latest innovation is personally 
directed at Aleksandr Belyayev, the former city soviet chairman 
and currently a deputy from St. Petersburg to the upper chamber 
of the Federal Assembly. Especially since Aleksandr Belyayev is 
head of "Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg" -- the bloc with 
the best chance of winning in the city -- and is regarded as the 
most likely candidate for City Assembly chairman. Expecting 
nothing good to come of that, the mayor has little by little 
been creating problems for "senator" Belyayev: on Thursday he 
was excluded from the special communications system, on Friday 
his official car was taken away, and on Saturday he was denied 
the right to participate in city elections. 
  The administration's legal escapades have resulted in 
essentially every organization, from the communists to 
Democratic Russia, now rejecting this "hip pocket" version of 
the City Assembly as decreed by Sobchak, and coming out in favor 
of expanded rights for the legislative branch. Incidentally, 
they also reject the previous St. Petersburg City Soviet model 
just as unanimously. One of the principal shortcomings 
programmed into it was deputies' inclination to constantly 
extrapolate their position to the Russia-wide political level. 
The mentality of the "second capital," a city whose voice is 
heeded in any situation, constantly prompted the deputies to 
undertake messianic initiatives, such as the struggle against 
the central USSR government, participation in the 
"constitutional process," and so on. Now the universal image is 
of deputies who deal primarily with city issues and are familiar 
with the structure of the city economy and the interests of the 
various social and professional groups in the population. 
  The political configuration of campaign associations (a 
total 
of 34 organizations and blocs have been authorized to collect 
signatures!) is highly specific. Naturally city leaders will 
inevitably exploit the symbolic potential of their party "stars" 
from Moscow. But the correlation of forces in the city is by no 
means an exact copy of the Russia-wide political landscape. Here 
we see the effects of special connections which formed in the 
past between politicians and various organizations. 
  One shining example of this is "Democratic Unity of 
Petersburg," which unites 29 organizations, many of which 
participated in the December election independently or else as 
part of other blocs. These include Democratic Russia, Memorial, 
PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Consensus], PES [Economic 
Freedom Party] and social democrats and republics attached to 
Yabloko. 
  Among the candidates from this bloc, which is headed by 
Aleksandr Belyayev, are many former deputies of the St. 
Petersburg City Soviet and businesspeople. It also includes 
well-known jeweler Andrey Ananov. Among the bloc's campaign 
slogans are demands for a new mayoral election, because under 
Sobchak "city hall's actions have been shrouded in deepest 
secrecy; it has assumed all the functions of the KGB." Belyayev 
has filed suit against the mayor and together with a group of 
St. Petersburg politicians went to Moscow to raise the issue of 
Sobchak's activities. 
  Aleksandr Belyayev's bloc is in competition with the "All of 
St. Petersburg" association. It was established by 
businesspeople, bankers from the three largest banks and public 
officials involved in privatization. Its leader is Sergey 
Belyayev, chairman of the Federal Administration for Enterprise 
Bankruptcies under the Russian Federation State Committee for 
State Property Management. Many of the organizers of "All of St. 
Petersburg" were formerly members of the "Russia's Choice" 
movement. However, now those who represent big business have 
decided to defend their interests separately, rejecting a 
temporary alliance with the "experienced" but penniless veterans 
of the democratic movement. 
  Despite the fact that these blocs are backed by various 
business circles and financial groups, there is still a chance 
that they will conclude a "non-aggression pact" among 
themselves. For example, on a list of "untouchable" candidates. 
However, it is already becoming clear that they will not be able 
to transform their associations into "civilized" parties. 
Despite original intentions to create a professional political 
elite, "Democratic Unity" has been transformed into a temporary 
alliance between various political organizations. And "All of 
St. Petersburg," which has not been able to form a broad 
political coalition, remains a closed, elitist club for those 
who "have already become established in their fields," a society 
that is counting on the current elite, not the formation of a 
new one, and therefore supports the principle of a 
"non-professional" City Assembly. 
  The extreme "implacable" opposition is divided into two 
mutually hostile factions. The ultra-communists (the BKPB, the 
RKRP [Russian Communist Workers Party], the RKP [Communist Party 
of Russian] and "Laboring Leningrad") have joined together with 
the nationalist radicals ("Ours" and the "Union of Officers") to 
form the "Motherland" bloc. They reject all contacts with both 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and with Zyuganov's KPRF 
[Communist Party of the Russian Federation], which they regard 
as provocateurs. In addition, "patriots" independent of the 
communist groups have established a "purely nationalist" bloc 
called "Great Russia" (comprised of ROS [Russian National 
Union], the Russian Party and the Russian National Assembly). 
  Finally, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has not 
deviated from its rules and will campaign separately. With 
approximately 400 people in its organization, it hopes to win 15 
City Assembly seats. It is noteworthy that its slogans are 
largely in line with the ideas of the "radical democrats" 
--merger of city and oblast, a new mayoral election, expanded 
rights for the legislative branch, an end to restrictions on 
voting rights, etc. 
  Of course, the whole campaign still lies ahead, but even now 
there is reason to expect that the future City Assembly will 
involve a tactical coalition comprised of two-thirds of the 
deputies and directed against the current administration chief. 
And, come what may, that outcome will inevitably result in a 
redistribution of political roles within St. Petersburg's ruling 
class.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov, by </F>
Yuriy Kozlov, under "Face to Face" rubric: "In Nizhniy Novgorod 
Every Other Person Belongs to the Third Estate"; date and place 
not given] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod is, with good reason, 
regarded as the proving grounds of economic reforms in Russia. 
However, there is only one political figure in the limelight: 
Oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov. Yet there is another, no less 
prominent, person there, city mayor Dmitriy Bednyakov. The far 
from complete list of accomplishments of the city administration 
includes its privatization program, Russia's first city charter, 
development of unified banking principles, targeted social 
assistance, reorganization of residential housing, medical 
insurance. Today Nizhniy Novgorod is one of the few places in 
Russia where life is indeed getting better. 
  [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, it is no secret that Russia's 
economy is the aggregate of its regional economies. Since the 
resignation of Gaydar and Fyodorov all one hears is that the 
government is, allegedly, veering away from the course of 
reforms. What is your assessment of what's going on in Moscow 
from the vantage point of Nizhniy Novgorod? 
  [Bednyakov] As I see it, the changes in the government will 
least of all affect the state of affairs in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
Although one cannot say, of course, that they will have no 
effect at all. If the government goes back to its previous 
credit policy and starts using the budget to "pump up" 
enterprises and entire branches of industry, this, doubtlessly, 
will cause a new surge of inflation, creating headaches for 
everyone. But all in all, today the regional economy depends on 
the economic policies pursued by the local authorities. 
  [Kozlov] What, specifically, are the policies of the Nizhniy 
Novgorod authorities? 
  [Bednyakov] I would note two basic elements. Firstly, there 
is full support of private enterprise and business expansion. If 
a person wants to earn money, and can, he should do so, and no 
one has the right to interfere. Provided, of course, that he 
doesn't break the law or avoid paying taxes. The second element 
is sufficiently effective social protection of those segments of 
the population which need this. These are young people, 
pensioners, large families, invalids, in short, all those for 
whom today's life is especially difficult. Balancing these two 
elements in the framework of a unified economic policy is the 
main concern of the regional authorities. 
  [Kozlov] Many people say this, but so far successes are 
rather few. Privatization and joint stock programs are making 
some progress, but social programs are almost universally 
failing. Incidentally, Nizhniy Novgorod is known more as a 
"market beacon," but not a "social beacon." 
  [Bednyakov] Indeed, we were the first in Russia to free 
bread 
and milk prices and eliminate coupons for virtually all goods 
and services. But these moves were invariably accompanied by 
measures for social protection of the population. Last September 
we--again the first in Russia--introduced low-income benefits. 
Last year the maximum subsidy was R23,000. This year it has more 
than doubled. And that is not counting aid for children, school 
lunches, etc. I think reforms in Russia will be successful if 
they have two sufficiently strong "wings": support for 
entrepreneurship and social protection of the poor. 
  [Kozlov] That is so, but where will the money for this come 
from? 
  [Bednyakov] There was a time when huge sums were taken daily 
from the city budget to subsidize milk and bread producers. When 
we freed the prices of these products considerable sums were 
made available, which, incidentally, we immediately began to pay 
out to those who were unable to buy milk and bread at the free 
prices. And this proved to be fairer. Formerly both rich and 
poor households received subsidies. Now they are addressed only 
to those who are unable to make ends meet, that is, the really 
poor. Incidentally, this helped to "correct" people's mentality 
noticeably. Now people are concerned not so much with getting 
low-income benefits for themselves as with the availability of 
goods on store shelves. I can state confidently that Nizhniy 
Novgorod already has a mixed economy. The picture is determined 
not so much by state enterprises as by private and joint 
ventures. 
  [Kozlov] But Nizhniy Novgorod is also known for former 
"flagships" of socialist industry, GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant] 
in the first place. Incidentally, how are things there? 
  [Bednyakov] As of today, a closed sale of shares has been 
completed, an inter-regional check auction of GAZ shares has 
been held, and the plant is preparing for its first 
shareholders' meeting. Now GAZ is an open type joint-stock 
company. Of course, GAZ, like other large enterprises, is in a 
very difficult situation. It has to think of new types of 
products and how to market them. But in my view the situation at 
GAZ gives no grounds to fear that the plant may come to a halt 
soon and more than 110,000 workers will be left in the street. 
Although, of course, the GAZ management could be better. It 
seems to me that the conflict over GAZ, which has been so widely 
publicized in the press, is essentially a problem of management 
and of attracting foreign investment. Of course, Western 
businessmen do not want to see GAZ as a serious competitor on 
the market, hence their attitude towards the plant. We shouldn't 
fool ourselves. One could, of course, replace executives and 
improve the management, but that is no guarantee that Western 
monies will start flowing to us. They won't. Although GAZ, of 
course, definitely needs reforming on both the technological and 
managerial levels. 
  [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, what has the city gained from 
the 
once widely advertized privatization program? Do revenues from 
privatized enterprises contribute significantly to the budget? 
  [Bednyakov] The state has finally given up doing things it 
wasn't meant to do and stopped controlling everything under the 
sun. The budget has indeed begun to receive real money, and in 
significant quantities. Local authorities have finally begun to 
deal with things all local authorities should: public amenities, 
roads, public safety, transportation, housing. We began the 
program with privatization of retail enterprises. Although there 
was an opposing point of view: to privatize large enterprises 
first. I think we took the right road. Now there already is a 
competitive atmosphere in the city. As of today, up to 70 
percent of Nizhniy Novgorod's retail enterprises have been 
privatized. We are operating according to a somewhat unusual 
scheme: we sell not enterprises, but the assets of liquidated 
enterprises. The new owner is, thus, not required to rehire 
former workers. However, if people lose their jobs he must pay 
benefits. Neither is the new owner responsible for the acquired 
enterprise's debts. We view privatization like this: The idea is 
not to sell for the highest possible price, but to sell so that 
the new owner could start operating efficiently as quickly as 
possible. 
  [Kozlov] But still, how are things with the privatization of 
large enterprises? 
  [Bednyakov] In my view, this has not yet taken place. What 
has been called stock distribution [aktsionirovaniye] is 
essentially the commercialization of large enterprises. They 
appear to change the form of ownership, but they still remain 
state-owned. 
  It seems to me that the country lacks a mechanism for 
privatizing large enterprises. There is no way to buy and sell 
large packets of shares of such enterprises quickly. Russia has 
no normally operating stock market, it still has to be set up. 
Once there is no way to operate with large packets of shares 
they fall into the hands of enterprise directors, who use them 
in their own interests. Real privatization will begin only when 
a potential large investor will be able to buy a large packet of 
shares of the enterprise he wants on the stock market. We are 
currently actively dealing with this problem. I head the oblast 
commission for organizing a stock market. A new influx of 
investment into the oblast's economy can come only through the 
stock market. All other possibilities have, as I see it, been 
exhausted. 
  [Kozlov] What do you see as the main areas of work this 
year? 
  [Bednyakov] Questions connected with reorganizing the 
housing 
sphere and public utilities. For over a year we have been 
working on problems of housing subsidies. Because, if monthly 
payments for housing exceed a certain percentage of a family's 
total income we must pay people a housing subsidy. From the 
purely technical point of view we have not yet resolved this 
question. How to ensure that a person getting this money will 
spend it solely to pay for housing? It is necessary, thus, to 
have special "housing" funds. The main task this year is to find 
a mechanism for reorganizing the housing market that would be 
fair, effective, and socially protect the majority of the 
population. We have already developed a special program spanning 
several years. 
  [Kozlov] And how are matters with insured health care? 
  [Bednyakov] Last year we began an experiment in financing 
health institutions according to the number of cured patients. 
It was tried out in several hospitals. It showed that doctors 
are morally prepared to work more efficiently. The main 
stumbling block is that as yet there are no political decisions 
on this score that would be associated with changing budget 
flows. So far they pass through the health care system, but they 
should be handled by hospital insurance funds, insurance 
companies, and so forth. An entire institution of medical 
insurance agents has to be created. Today it is impossible to 
approach this problem seriously. But we are moving in the right 
direction. We are planning to try introducing insured health 
care on the basis of the GAZ medical department. Doctors will 
receive budgeted pay, with everything over that coming from the 
enterprise, depending on the quality of their work. I think the 
move from free to insured health care should be very careful, 
without undue haste, but not too slowly, either. 
  [Kozlov] What do you expect in the near future from the 
government, the president, and the federal assembly? 
  [Bednyakov] The main issues that have to be clarified are 
taxes and the budget. The revenues of local budgets, in fact the 
very existence of territories, depend in many ways on the 
resolution of these questions. There is some apprehension that 
the new government will pursue a less reformist policy than one 
would like. Most of all I fear growing inflation, although 
inflation in itself is not as bad as the fact that the society 
gets used to it and people blend into the inflationary 
mechanism. This, doubtlessly, adversely affects all types of 
economic activity. We are not indifferent to the policies of the 
government, the president and the federal assembly. But, I 
repeat, since the reforms began, Russia's regions and 
territories have grown strong enough to handle many issues 
independently. Like we do in Nizhniy Novgorod. In that sense I 
am an optimist. According to the latest polls, 40 to 50 percent 
of Nizhniy Novgorod inhabitants list themselves as middle class. 
This gives hope that the reforms in Russia have become 
irreversible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Emil Pain, member of the Presidential </F>
Council, by Mari Silven in Moscow; date not given: "Treaty 
Advantageous to Russia"] 
  [Text] Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council, 
was part of the presidential team during the visit to Georgia. 
In an interview granted OBSHCHAYA GAZETA on his return to Moscow 
he describes his impressions, justifies B. Yeltsin's position at 
the negotiations, and takes issue with deputies of the State 
Duma. 
  [Silven] On the eve of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi you 
were 
apprehensive as to how the Georgian public would greet the 
president.... 
  [Pain] Yes, his circle was concerned about how B. Yeltsin 
would be accepted by representatives of the intelligentsia, with 
whom he was to meet. But the meeting was quite relaxed. There 
was a great deal of joking, but difficult questions concerning 
Russia and Abkhazia were asked also. The audience in the House 
of Scientists was in an exultant mood, virtually, and this was 
explained, I believe, not so much by the traditional Georgian 
hospitality as by the fact that people in Georgia are wishing 
for a miracle. Aside from the hope of this, they have nothing 
left. Yet they can hope for a miracle only from Moscow. 
  In his speech Yeltsin said for the first time that Russia 
did 
not absolve itself of some of the blame for what had happened in 
Georgia also, and this enjoyed a phenomenal success. Generally, 
the previous democratic solidarity between the Georgian and 
Russian intelligentsia was recalled, in the main. The mood was 
one of forgiving Russia for everything that happened with 
Abkhazia and of recalling that which was connected with the 
formation of independent Georgia. 
  [Silven] Recalled by whom? 
  [Pain] Well, E. Shengelaya, head of the Union of 
Cinematographers of Georgia, and A. Tavkhelidze, president of 
the Academy of Sciences, for example. 
  But I was struck most by the abrupt change of position in 
connection with integration with Russia. That same 
intelligentsia which had considered Georgia's independence a 
means of salvation from all troubles is now, having drained a 
cupful of independence, saying: "It is not we who are to blame, 
it was Russia that pushed us out of the Union." A desire to 
justify oneself is psychologically understandable, like the 
desire to find someone else to blame. In order to explain their 
own defeat they are also talking about the interference of a 
"third force." 
  [Silven] And were you not concerned for B. Yeltsin's 
physical 
safety? 
  [Pain] We were, of course, and this is why he was heavily 
guarded. But everything turned out alright. There was just one 
tiny episode: As Yeltsin was leaving the House of Scientists, a 
group of young street children tried to jeer him. And here E. 
Shevardnadze made an exceptional gesture: He slammed shut the 
door of his car and alone, without security, walked down 
Rustaveli Street. The mood of the crowd changed instantly. The 
public broke into applause, and he was greeted in such a way 
that I had the feeling that I was once again in August 1991, 
when Shevardnadze led a column of demonstrators to the Russian 
White House. The level of democratism demonstrated by 
Shevardnadze is convincing. Anyone may approach him 
unhindered--despite the fact that the situation in Georgia is 
extremely unsafe. The Russian president cannot be approached 
that easily. 
  [Silven] How do you evaluate the results of the trip? An 
opponent of the treaty called it "a translation from the 
Georgian," maintaining thereby that the treaty is beneficial 
only to Tbilisi. What arguments could you in point of substance 
counterpose to the position of the councilmen? 
  [Pain] I believe that if the reference is to practical 
matters, this treaty is more to Russia's advantage. Georgia has 
obtained credit, and there will be an increase in the supplies 
of gas and other forms of energy, but not on a scale such as 
might pull the country out of the present critical situation. 
This is more a symbolic, psychological gesture. 
  For Russia, on the other hand, the treaty has solved certain 
most complex questions. The problem of its outlet to the Black 
Sea, for example. Russia has currently the sole small port of 
Novorossiysk. In accordance with the treaty, Georgia will make 
available to Russia its ports and, primarily, the tanker port of 
Batumi. An agreement was reached also on the creation of three 
military bases on the territory of Georgia. This is the first 
such agreement, I believe, throughout the time of the existence 
of the new independent states. It is not a question, 
incidentally, of new contingents of troops but of remnants of 
the units of the former Transcaucasus Military District. Their 
transfer to Russia and their ability to fend for themselves 
(together with their families) would have cost us more than the 
legalization of these formations in Georgia. 
  Much is being said currently about the problem of Russians 
in 
the near abroad. They are fleeing Georgia, but fleeing hunger, 
cold, and the increase in crime, and by helping Georgia, 
therefore, Russia is alleviating also the position of its 
compatriots. 
  [Silven] Why, then, did parliament declare its rejection of 
the treaty? 
  [Pain] The solidarity with which all factions opposed the 
draft treaty is impressive. It could have arisen in the soil of 
the fact that all factions in the Duma are now of the 
opposition. But I believe that the position of Russia's Choice 
in this case is more the result of insufficient thought and a 
survival of the once-popular quasi-democratic idea of a nation's 
right to self-determination. This principle has not, as we all 
know, been elaborated in international practice, nor has 
Democratic Russia clarified its interpretation. Who has the 
right to self-determination: an ethnic group or the entire 
territorial community? Is self-determination following ethnic 
purges permissible? If so, any territory could engage in this. 
  The protest of the other factions ensues from the doctrine, 
which is very fashionable currently, of vital interests and 
reintegration. And many people understand the latter in the 
medieval sense of the word, what is more: as Russia's 
territorial acquisitions. Not everything can be annexed today, 
naturally, and for this reason the supporters of reintegration 
are hankering after what is ailing. After "pieces" which, it 
would seem, are asking to be admitted to Russia themselves. 
Where would we be were we to put this idea into practice? The 
countries from which "pieces that are ailing" had been "ripped 
off" would become a zone of hatred around Russia and that same 
cordon sanitaire which all the councilmen in Central Europe so 
unanimously reject. 
  The Duma has two political poles, conditionally speaking: 
"imperialists" and "isolationists." The first clash between them 
was played out over unification of the monetary systems of 
Russia and Belarus: The "isolationists" were opposed, the 
"imperialists," in favor. In the Georgian business they were 
oddly on the same side of the barricades because the 
"isolationists" are opposed to feeding a poor Georgia, and the 
"imperialists" support openly or in veiled form the annexation 
to Russia of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But how is it possible 
to advocate the integrity of Russia and at the same time deny 
neighboring states this right? This ambiguity is today 
widespread among Russian politicians. It has determined the 
Duma's decisions to a considerable extent. But at the same time 
I believe that a share of the blame for the treaty incident is 
borne by the executive also. Why did it not harmonize this 
document with a number of Duma committees and explain and, 
perhaps, emend individual wording in it before the president's 
trip? 
  [Silven] You refer to the Duma's principal objections 
connected with article 3 of the treaty, according to which 
Russia undertakes to assist in the creation of a Georgian 
national army? It is said that this is tantamount to arming it 
for war against Abkhazia. 
  [Pain] In actual fact, everything is the other way about. 
The 
treaty links military assistance with stages of a political 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict: initially 
agreements, then an army. 
  Russia is interested in the creation of a Georgian army and 
border services. It is not a matter of indifference for it what 
the border with Chechnya looks like: whether this is a 
passageway in which armed detachments fight among themselves or 
the fortified border of a state firmly oriented toward Russia. 
According to the treaty, the parties would undertake to prevent 
border crossings by armed detachments. 
  However paradoxical, incidentally, the Ossetians and the 
Abkhaz should have an objective interest in the formation of a 
regular Georgian army because it is not a regular army but 
uncontrolled formations that represent the main danger. As long 
as the latter exist, the danger of the ouster of Shevardnadze 
will remain. Any other Georgian leader--of those currently 
visible on the horizon--would be more frightening for Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia. 
  Further, it is very important that Shevardnadze acknowledged 
for the first time--if only in a small group at the 
negotiations, publicly, nonetheless--the need for Georgia's 
political arrangement on the principles of federalization. This 
very term had previously been shunned in Georgia, now, however, 
this word was tossed into the negotiations. 
  [Silven] It is maintained that the treaty is inopportune.... 
  [Pain] Why so? There are no Georgian troops in Abkhazia, 
just 
as there are, for that matter, no Georgians at all--the largest 
ethnic group prior to the start of the conflict: An ethnic purge 
was carried out there. So the return of refugees--almost 200,000 
persons--is inopportune? It was the mechanisms and technical 
conditions of their return that were discussed with his Georgian 
colleague by S. Shoygu, chairman of the Committee for Emergency 
Situations. 
  As far as the idea of the impossibility of the conclusion of 
a treaty between Russia and Georgia prior to a political 
settlement of the disputes between Georgia and Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia is concerned, it does not, in my view, withstand 
criticism. There are just the same problems in the majority of 
CIS states. So we should not be signing a treaty with Ukraine 
until the latter regulates relations with Crimea? There are 
similar problems in Russia itself, come to that: Can we deny 
other states the conclusion of a treaty because relations 
between the federal authorities of Russia and Chechnya have not 
been completely clarified? 
  This will not be achieved in a matter of days or months 
even. 
Leaving interstate relations unsettled, on the other hand, 
merely means stimulating a continuation of the conflict inasmuch 
as one of its main causes is contained in the uncertainty of 
Moscow's official position on the question of the territorial 
integrity and the borders of Georgia--notwithstanding the fact 
that Russian citizens are, as we all know, fighting on the side 
of the Abkhaz. 
  The question of permissible forms of assistance to 
ethnically 
related peoples is a very serious problem. No one can prohibit 
cultural contacts between related peoples or economic 
assistance. Legal protection of ethnic minorities--kinsfolk on a 
different territory--via the system of international mechanisms 
is permitted in principle also. But the formation of illegal 
military detachments and the crossing of a border with weapons 
to participate in civil wars on the side of one's "own" ethnic 
community are absolutely impermissible. 
  Nowhere do ethnic borders coincide with political borders, 
and were the world community to recognize the possibility of the 
armed protection by an ethnic metropolis of its diasporas in 
other countries, the world would be threatened by general 
carnage and total conflicts throughout the world. It is Russia's 
duty, therefore, as a member of the Security Council, to put a 
decisive stop to such operations.

L.M. Kravchuk by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy 
Zholdak; held in the office of the president of Ukraine on 9 
December 1993; published under the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA

  [Text] 
<H3>  The President Goes All the Way on Nonnuclear Status and 
Makes a New Statement Through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </H3>
  [Zholdak] Did you talk to Clinton from here, from your 
working office? 
  [Kravchuk] This is the telephone I used to conduct the 
conversation with Mr. Clinton. 
  [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator? 
  [Kravchuk] He is generally very polite. There has not been a 
case yet in which presidents have talked to each other 
impolitely. It is our politicians that frequently try to outdo 
one another in impoliteness. Clinton is a very polite man. I 
have communicated with him on the phone three times: first, when 
I congratulated him on his election as President; the second 
time he called me, when I was at the dacha, during the period of 
strikes in summer; and now for a third time. 
  [Zholdak] Did you talk in the morning or in the evening? 
  [Kravchuk] In the evening. 
  [Zholdak] You sat.... Did you know that he would be calling? 
  [Kravchuk] Certainly. I had been notified. 
  [Zholdak] In what language did you talk to him--English or 
Ukrainian? 
  [Kravchuk] I talked in Ukrainian and he talked in English. 
Both he and I had our own interpreters. 
  [Zholdak] And, you say, very politely.... 
  [Kravchuk] He expressed the most respectful attitude toward 
both me and Ukraine. He always stresses the same thing: that 
America is interested in the existence of an independent 
Ukraine, and that it is in favor of the territorial integrity of 
Ukraine, and he assures me that he wishes Ukraine well. He 
starts with this every time. 
  [Zholdak] Is it true that a secret joint meeting of the 
representatives of the Security Councils of America and Russia 
was held in Moscow? Did they get together and discuss something 
against Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] No. 
  [Zholdak] Is this just talk? 
  [Kravchuk] Just talk. Recently there was a meeting of the 
Russian Security Council separately. This was reported in the 
press. However, not only Ukrainian issues were discussed there 
but also issues of overall security in the world. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
means defense, the existence of an independent Ukraine. When 
Kuchma was prime minister, he stated that he did not know what 
Morozov, our minister of defense at the time, was doing. Do you 
remember this phrase? 
  [Kravchuk] What about it? 
  [Zholdak] The Supreme Council does not resolve issues of 
effectiveness of the military mechanism either because it is a 
collective organ. Tell me please, Mr. President, who among the 
first, supreme officials of the state works on problems of the 
Armed Forces personally, systematically, and I would stress, 
responsibly? 
  [Kravchuk] The president. 
  [Zholdak] Does everything really devolve on you directly? 
  [Kravchuk] Everything that concerns the Armed Forces is 
reported in its entirety solely to the president. The president 
is commander in chief. 
  [Zholdak] Are you a colonel or...? 
  [Kravchuk] A colonel. 
  [Zholdak] It is good that at least you do not promote 
yourself to the rank of marshal, as our Communist leaders once 
did. 
  [Kravchuk] Rank is not the issue. The main point is to 
prevent war and bloodshed in the state. 
  [Zholdak] On this, Mr. President, we will give you due 
credit: During the two years of your "reign" certain, putting it 
mildly, unfriendly forces have not succeeded in getting the 
Ukrainian people involved in ruinous conflicts. 
  [Kravchuk] I repeat that the president is responsible for 
the 
security of our people to the greatest extent. And if you, Mr. 
Editor in Chief, do not have any more questions about nuclear 
weapons, and it appears that we have discussed this in a quite 
detailed and popular way.... 
  [Zholdak] Yes, you sorted it all out in a popular way. 
  [Kravchuk] I will declare yet again: No matter who clamors 
or 
votes in favor of nuclear armaments, Ukraine must get rid of 
nuclear weapons. This is due to military-political, technical, 
ecological, and other circumstances. However, this should be 
done proceeding from the interests of the people. 
  [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will concur with you on this, 
Mr. 
President, if crafty Russia, or whoever else together with it, 
pays all bills to us for all weapons, both tactical and 
strategic. 
  [Kravchuk] I will ensure this. 
  [Zholdak] Russia is demanding debts from us, whereas it 
itself is an even greater debtor of ours. Let its present 
leaders first return to us 16 percent of the USSR reserves of 
valuables--diamonds, gold, and other valuables. They have the 
gall to put pressure on you.... Do not yield to them, and the 
people will support you, Leonid Makarovych. However, at present 
the state of the mood of the popular masses is highly volcanic. 
I mean our current poor material situation. The people, most of 
the people, are concerned about what they are going to eat 
tomorrow. Everything is expensive, everything is beyond 
reach.... Undoubtedly, you know this as well as I do. 
  [Kravchuk] Indeed, our economic difficulties have reached a 
critical high point. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, here is the main question which 
at present alarms Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We have 
received an interesting letter. Its author quotes your 
well-known pronouncement that is particularly fashionable coming 
from the lips of various leaders who care about Ukrainian 
independence only in a manner of speaking. You came up with it: 
"We have what we have." Our reader is indignant about these 
words, and he specifies, to my mind correctly, their message 
with regard to the situation that has developed in the state. He 
maintains: "We have what we have allowed." Indisputably, this 
arrow was aimed at you, Leonid Makarovych.... Therefore, here is 
the following question for you: How could it be that after 
prices for foodstuffs, to say nothing of manufactured consumer 
goods, were raised sharply by the Cabinet of Ministers, which 
you lead, the Ukrainian people became paupers overnight, and at 
the same time very malicious toward the leaders of its state, 
and toward you in particular? Why did this happen? Be so kind as 
to explain it in a simple and popular manner, without 
"scientific" substantiation, if you would. 
  [Kravchuk] In a popular way, here it is. If we had real 
borders with all states of the world, I repeat--real borders 
rather than loopholes, as is the case now, just a belt with all 
the attributes of a border, if we had customs checkpoints 
likewise with all the attributes, we could establish within the 
country prices that are in line with our economic potential. 
This is the first point. Second.... 
  [Zholdak] Pardon me, Mr. President, so, is the permeability 
of our borders, i.e. the absence of real borders in our country, 
the first reason for the growth of prices? 
  [Kravchuk] No, no, I will explain. I will return to the 
main.... 
  [Zholdak] It is just that I want to understand so that we 
will not go far.... 
  [Kravchuk] We will not go far. At present, with our 
permeable 
borders, prices in a neighboring state automatically influence 
our situation. For example, we have lower prices, and Russia has 
higher prices. They export products to Russia, sell them for 
rubles, convert the rubles into dollars, get coupons again.... 
  [Zholdak] They clip coupons! 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, they do! And the process of exports goes on. 
  [Zholdak] This is clear. 
  [Kravchuk] So, the second point. Prices should be in line 
with costs. Our prices are not yet in line with costs. High 
prices are not even the issue. Do you understand? The issue is 
for wages to correspond to prices. 
  [Zholdak] Our political commentator, Academician Ihor 
Rafayilovich Yuknovskyy, has always maintained this. 
  [Kravchuk] I know. We should bring compensation for labor 
into line with prices, and then the standard of living of the 
people will grow. For example, the price may be one kopek, and 
the wage two kopeks. You will buy two things with two kopeks. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you said "we should bring," but 
when will this "should" become a reality? How will this happen? 
Are you already developing some kind of mechanism, or what? Are 
you and your cabinet just thinking about it? 
  [Kravchuk] Why thinking? We are working. 
  [Zholdak] However, the shops are now barren. How much longer 
will their beggarly appearance oppress our souls and our 
consciousness? 
  [Kravchuk] Why are they barren? Because everything has been 
removed from them. 
  [Zholdak] By whom? Where to? Did they simultaneously remove 
everything from all shops? 
  [Kravchuk] They exported half the products beyond the 
borders 
of Ukraine. Collective farms do not sell at such prices.... 
  [Zholdak] So, are they removing it from warehouses? Who is? 
  [Kravchuk] Look, you do not understand. At present, 
kolkhozes 
cannot sell products at low prices. These products should be 
subsidized, or else they will sell the products with their costs 
included. It cannot be otherwise. We gave 5 trillion in 
subsidies.... I think the subsidy came to 5 trillion in 1.5 
months! So, if we have the budget, these 5 trillion should be 
given to collective farms, and they will sell to you at low 
prices. Or else they will say: Defray my costs, I cannot 
maintain expanded reproduction. 
  [Zholdak] So, are the reasons for price raises yesterday and 
today to be found in permeable borders and prices that are not 
in line with costs? 
  [Kravchuk] The costs are the main reason. We need to either 
subsidize or decontrol prices. There is no other way. 
  [Zholdak] And you decontrolled them! 
  [Kravchuk] We decontrolled. The subsidies accomplished 
nothing. I associate loopholes in the borders with the fact that 
when subsidies exist, products are exported to where prices are 
higher. That is, the borders are not the main point, they do not 
rank first. However, all things are linked among themselves. I 
will repeat that prices are low in the environment of subsidies. 
Borders have to be under lock and key because of the subsidies 
so that products will not be exported to where prices are 
higher. Do you understand? 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, say more precisely, so that 
both 
I and the people who will read our interview will understand, 
when exactly changes for the better will occur, and when our 
impoverishment will stop. If only you could see how many old 
grannies have now appeared in front of bakeries. They stand 
there (may they forgive me) as if homeless, hungry four-legged 
creatures.... They are asking for a slice of a roll because they 
have nothing to buy it with. 
  [Kravchuk] I will repeat--when we bring wages into line with 
prices. 
  [Zholdak] When will this happen? Tomorrow, a month from now, 
10 years or 100 years from now? 
  [Kravchuk] When we finally determine what energy resources 
we 
will have and how much they will cost. Russia has recently 
raised prices for energy resources three times. Three times. 
  [Zholdak] So, it will raise prices continuously, and we will 
never.... 
  [Kravchuk] No, no. There is the world price. 
  [Zholdak] What is it? 
  [Kravchuk] At present, we do not yet have this world price. 
  [Zholdak] Why do we not? When will we? 
  [Kravchuk] In January of next year (1994--UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
editorial note). 
  [Zholdak] It will be set in January and then what-- 
stabilization occurs? 
  [Kravchuk] Than we will, for our part, establish the upper 
scale of prices. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] We will establish the scale of wages and 
retirement benefits, and everything will depend on labor 
productivity. For example, if we increase production, prices 
will fall. If we reduce production, prices will grow. This is 
legitimate. It cannot be otherwise. I will give you a simple 
example. You have 100 kilograms of bread. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] And you also have 100 people. You can give one 
kilogram to everyone regardless of how much money you pay to all 
of them. If you pay them more money they will buy the same 100 
kilograms with more money. That is to say, this is about 
increasing the number of kilograms. If we increase it, the price 
falls. At present, everybody is reducing it. Industry is cutting 
back production, there is less meat and less milk. There is less 
of everything. So, prices grow. 
  [Zholdak] However, wages do not grow accordingly. What is 
your salary as president? 
  [Kravchuk] Six hundred thousand, it seems. 
  [Zholdak] Six hundred thousand net? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, no, this is the entire salary. 
  [Zholdak] The entire salary? And nothing on top of it? No 
bonuses or extra pay? Nothing? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. 
  [Zholdak] It is not only too much but even terribly little 
for the president. How can the president be valued like that? 
  [Kravchuk] What is there to say when everybody gets low 
wages 
now. Some get a lot.... The issue now is how to equalize the 
ratios of costs, prices, and wages. This is the main issue for 
each state. Here, a multitude of problems are superimposed in 
this area-- technology, costs, world prices.... 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has started a 
new rubric: "Are People Cogs? People Are Pincers!" One of your 
fellow natives of Rivne responded to it. Ivan Ivanovych 
Podranetskyy wrote to us.... I will not quote the entire text 
because we will publish it separately. It was about the state, 
and you as its head, bringing about a situation where the people 
who before the price increases had savings that were 
considerable as of that time either at home or in savings banks, 
immediately became poor, destitute. What once was a few thousand 
karbovantsy has lost value and become simple pieces of paper. At 
first it was announced that a certain small amount of deposits 
would be increased by 200 percent. However, pardon me, this is 
too little, too late. What is to be done so that people will 
have what they had? Mr. President, this adage of yours is 
particularly appropriate in this instance. 
  [Kravchuk] If memory serves, the people in our country had 
90 
billion rubles [R] in passbook accounts. If we appraise it using 
this coefficient, it will now come to trillions, tens of 
trillions. 
  [Zholdak] Well. 
  [Kravchuk] So, we announce, for example, that you have a 
trillion. Can you buy anything with this trillion? This is not 
the issue.... You see? We may now be kind and announce to all: 
The state is paying you back, the state is giving to you. We 
live so that the state is supposed to give. 
  [Zholdak] What it must give.... 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. The state must give what is fair. However, 
where is the state to get this? What is the state? Does the 
president have money in his pocket? If collectives do not give 
this money, if the people who work do not give this money, where 
is it to be had? I met today with the director of a Yugoslav 
factory. It was an interesting meeting, lasting five minutes. I 
asked her: "How do you operate under the conditions of a war 
going on?" She answered: "All our workers there understood that 
they might only live if they worked. There is no other way." 
Further on, I asked: "What kind of taxes do you pay to the 
state?" She answered: "For each dinar, two dinars." I was 
astonished: "Then how do you live?" She said: "This is how we 
live, such is the situation." 
  [Zholdak] I understand what you are driving at. We should 
work, work, work.... 
  [Kravchuk] Wait. 
  [Zholdak] This is correct, Leonid Makarovych, but on one 
condition: Those who organize this "working" process should be 
able and willing to implement such an appeal to work. Directors, 
a majority of directors, do nothing but "cry": "We do not have 
this, all of our relations have been broken...." 
  [Kravchuk] I did not finish my thought. Please 
understand.... 
I would like to explain it to you in a popular manner. When we 
proclaimed our state, what did we begin with? Reduce the work 
day as much as possible. Provide as many social programs as 
possible. Provide as much social protection as possible. 
Provide! Provide! Provide! Everybody said that we were rich 
enough to be able to provide for and give everything to 
everyone. Here it is, take it! We forgot one thing: All this can 
only be created through work. You may put an angel in this 
office.... If people do not understand one simple thing, that a 
way out should be sought through work, through manufacturing 
high-quality products, through sales, and that foreign exchange 
has to be earned, we will always be poor. There is no other way 
out. Nobody will give us either oil or gas for free. Everybody 
lives by world prices. Why can Ukraine not follow them? 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you have been saying all along 
that we "must work." In this case, the directors themselves 
"must" be first forced to work and hustle. 
  [Kravchuk] Why "forced?" Then let us return to that regime, 
to the former owners of this office who engaged in this. 
  [Zholdak] No. 
  [Kravchuk] What do you mean by no? Down with democracy! Down 
with laws! What does "force" mean? 
  [Zholdak] Calling them to order, so as to make them 
accountable.... 
  [Kravchuk] In what way? 
  [Zholdak] If a director works poorly, does not want to 
handle 
the enterprise or does not know how, or is incapable of handling 
the enterprise, why should such a manager be retained? 
  [Kravchuk] However, you wrote yourself at one time--let the 
collectives elect the directors. 
  [Zholdak] This was wrong. 
  [Kravchuk] Here we are, wrong. I also say it is wrong. 
Everybody made a mistake, and now they want to find a scapegoat. 
Yes, I say: we must, we must, we must. After all, I cannot 
proclaim that I will issue an edict tomorrow, and that everyone 
will have to work under the whip. Down with the laws we have 
passed?... The people should understand this themselves. I 
repeat that there is no other way out. 
  [Zholdak] Still, what are we to do about the letter from 
your 
fellow native of Rivne? So that the karbovantsy will become 
valuable. 
  [Kravchuk] First, you must know that a decision on 
indexation 
was made by the Supreme Council, and that the value of savings 
will be included when the budget is approved. However, to the 
full extent.... My thinking is that, second, people should be 
told the truth: We are crediting everything for you to a special 
account and we will pay it back when we become rich. 
  [Zholdak] Can you announce this to the people? 
  [Kravchuk] I can. We will prepare proposals and 
calculations, 
and we will announce. 
  [Zholdak] Someone must become urgently concerned about the 
common people, the "cogs." The "pincers" will hack out, wrest, 
yank, and take theirs from the state. Let us promise that people 
will be compensated even in 10 years.... 
  [Kravchuk] We will definitely pay them back. 
  [Zholdak] After all, we will not be poor all the time, will 
we? I do not believe this. 
  [Kravchuk] Neither do I. 
  [Zholdak] Is Ukraine in the abyss now or not? What do you 
think? 
  [Kravchuk] Why in the abyss? In the abyss means being dead 
already. 
  [Zholdak] Why? One can still live in the abyss. Hetman 
Kalnyshevskyy lived to be 100 years in a "sack of stone." 
  [Kravchuk] This is not an abyss. 
  [Zholdak] More terrifying than an abyss. 
  [Kravchuk] If a man falls into an abyss it means certain 
death. 
  [Zholdak] So, we are not yet in a precipice, Mr. President? 
  [Kravchuk]) We may overcome this situation. 
  [Zholdak] What is the situation in Ukraine at present, to 
your mind? 
  [Kravchuk]) An extremely difficult economic situation. 
However, having this kind of resources, we may realistically 
bring about normal life in Ukraine. 
  [Zholdak] Thus, the situation is difficult, is it not? 
  [Kravchuk]) Extremely! 
  [Zholdak] Extremely! In this case, tell us who specifically 
brought this about? Who among the highly placed leaders? What do 
you think? Someone should finally be held accountable for the 
suffering of a great people, instead of fleeing abroad to 
diplomatic and commercial positions, as they are now saying 
about the civil servant, currently the "Frenchman" Mr. Lobov, 
say, the former minister of power generation and already the 
"American" Mr. Sklyarov, and, say, an "active fighter" against 
the state structures of the mafia, the former deputy prime 
minister and likewise the "American" Mr. Yoffe.... 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this is a "witch" hunt. This is 
understandable. 
  [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, someone should be 
responsible for everything. Or would you like to, pardon me, 
have to take the rap for everything? I do not want to blame you 
alone for the country experiencing such a collapse and 
destitution.... 
  [Kravchuk] No, I may say so.... I do not want to.... You 
would understand that you are asking me a difficult question. As 
president, the highest individual in the state, am I supposed to 
shift the blame to someone else? I may only blame myself. This 
is it. I cannot shift it to anyone, and I will not. In 
principle, I am against a search for enemies and those 
responsible for this or that. Everybody.... Now let us 
deliberate this way. Was I the only one to whom the idea, for 
example, to follow the path we have opted for occurred? No. The 
people of Ukraine decided that. We opted for this path, we voted 
in favor of it. 
  [Zholdak] Do you mean the path of independence? As it were, 
Kuchma stated when he was prime minister that he did not know 
what needed to be built and what path needed to be followed. 
  [Kravchuk] Why does he not know? I think that he said that 
in 
the heat of the moment. 
  [Zholdak] Apparently, for this reason he already wants to 
become president of Ukraine now that he has been removed from 
the position of the head of government. Perhaps he believes that 
from the height of this state position he will see the landmarks 
toward which to proceed. Mr. President, we are building an 
independent, happy Ukraine. 
  [Kravchuk] Absolutely! And we know that this entails 
sacrifices. We know that this inevitably entails devastation. 
Because.... You will understand.... We are building a state out 
of a piece. We import 80 percent of everything from Russia and 
other states. We are now saying: Look for it internally. We 
look, and we find. We have found it somewhere. We should also be 
aware of favorable processes in this. Where and when.... 
Recently I went to Tunisia. They have been building that state 
for 37 years now. Thirty-seven years! To this day they have a 
great many difficulties. However, there is progress. We started 
to build the state only two years ago and want things to get 
better right away. We were taken in by an illusion--as soon as 
we proclaimed independence, we decided that things would get 
easier right away, everything would be cheap, cheap sausage 
would become cheaper still, and we would not even work.... Do 
you know what the length of the work day is in South Korea at 
present? 
  [Zholdak] Six hours? 
  [Kravchuk] Fourteen hours! 
  [Zholdak] In the South Korea which, I think, has all it can 
desire? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, this is one of the richest countries of the 
world. And they get about nine or 12 days of leave--I do not 
remember exactly. Nobody raises the issue of having leave for 
all right away and the shortest work day in the world. The state 
must be built up, a new economy must be built up, wealth must be 
created first, and then these things should be discussed. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, I may be mistaken, but so far 
it 
is not apparent that you personally, as president, have achieved 
even a small success in anything--I mean primarily in "creating 
wealth." 
  [Kravchuk] I do not see this either. Look at this.... I 
submit the issue of commodity bonds. They block me. I submit the 
issue, I was prepared and am prepared now to proceed to sell the 
old fleet which Ukraine does not need. They block me. I 
submit.... 
  [Zholdak] However, you up and sold the fleet to Russia.... 
  [Kravchuk] I did not sell it to anyone.... 
  [Zholdak] In September you signed an agreement with Yeltsin 
in Massandra.... You wanted to sell.... 
  [Kravchuk] We merely signed an intent. 
  [Zholdak] All the same, why sign even an intent? 
  [Kravchuk] I am convinced even now that we must sell. 
  [Zholdak] However, sell rather than give or transfer to 
Russia for some kind of astronomical debts invented by them. In 
general, if they are allowed into Sevastopol with all of its 
infrastructures, they will altogether evict us from there. 
  [Kravchuk] Can you drive them out of Sevastopol? 
  [Zholdak] No. We are not capable of doing this at present. 
  [Kravchuk] Then why the idle talk when it is necessary to 
agree with Russia on normal principles of cooperation in the 
region? If the issue of "driving them out" is raised, this means 
war. I am convinced that Ukraine will be an independent state 
only on the condition that it establishes a partnership, 
good-neighbor relations with Russia. Anyone who has not grasped 
this understands nothing about politics.

  [Text] 
<H3>  Who Is Leading Us Now? What Do We Have? Where Are We Going? 
How Are We To Become Happy? </H3>
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, let us talk about cadres and, 
of 
course, your cadre policy. Who leads us, where, and how, mainly 
depends on you and your decisions. Let us return to our recent 
past for a while. The Supreme Council gave a vote of no 
confidence in the government and in its head, Leonid Kuchma. The 
latter held on for 11 months in the position of prime minister, 
and later, when he was brought down, began to declare that in 
your entourage and that of Ivan Plyushch and other ranking 
leaders he encountered meanness, slyness, and so on. This is his 
business. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. However, I think that he had also 
encountered 
such things before. 
  [Zholdak] Let him say it. So it is--an impotent government. 
He was removed; he was unable to implement changes for the 
benefit of Ukraine. Logically, new people should have come in, 
all the more so because you personally undertook to put together 
a team of ministers and their prime minister. However, you kept 
all the old cadres, with the exception of Morozov and Herts. 
Such logic is incomprehensible. Will these leaders who together 
with Kuchma botched up reforms in Ukraine be better working with 
you? Did you deliberately agree to personally being dragged down 
by them, too? 
  [Kravchuk] No, this was not the issue. You see, had the 
Supreme Council not made the decision on early elections we 
would have duly submitted this to that same Supreme Council. I 
am not the only one to form the government. The Supreme Council 
does so together with the president. 
  [Zholdak] Pardon me, Mr. President, I am asking you about 
why 
you took the old government which does not have the respect of 
the people. 
  [Kravchuk] Because it is impossible to form a new government 
for four months. There is managerial experience. No less than 
four months is needed for one to become a minister who knows at 
least something in a specific area. Had everybody been replaced 
at the same time, the ministers would have only been learning 
their jobs for the entire four months, or until the very 
elections. How would we have governed then, how would we have 
controlled the situation? The issue now is to control the 
situation and create conditions for transformations, to prevent 
slipping into an abyss, as you put it, or further still. Not 
everybody understands what it means to be in the government and 
to think every day about where to find $100 in order to pay for 
gas and oil, pay retirement benefits, and so on. These are the 
existing realities. Everybody may now be blamed--the president, 
the government, and there are grounds for such accusations. 
However, a way out of the situation should be found. Let us look 
for it. 
  [Zholdak] How do you look for it? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us look for it together. A congress of 
industrialists met today, and is meeting now. Proposals are 
being developed there that will be discussed together with the 
government. Decisions will be made. A search is on in 
ministries, departments, and international organizations. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, how could this have 
happened.... 
Here you are, an economist. Well, not that prominent an 
economist, correct? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course. 
  [Zholdak] However, you know the essence of the matter. Look, 
two years have already passed, and nobody has been able to 
develop an economic program for overcoming the crisis. Why has 
it happened this way? Why do we lack any kind of clear bearings? 
If only we were successful in something, had stopped something. 
  [Kravchuk] Seven programs have been approved by our Supreme 
Council. There are seven programs, but not one of them is being 
carried out. 
  [Zholdak] How about finding just one and doing it properly? 
We have an Academy of Sciences. For many years we have had its 
invariable President Paton whom, excuse me, you kiss and hug. He 
should have retired long ago. Meanwhile, you support him. He was 
a Shcherbytskyy man in his time. 
  [Kravchuk] I have my own idea of Paton, regardless of whose 
man he was. He has done very much for the academy. The academy 
is holding up at present, too. He has great authority in the 
world. 
  [Zholdak] New cadres should come along. One cannot head the 
same establishment for 32 years, correct? 
  [Kravchuk] The scientists themselves determine who to elect 
and who to respect. This is not up to me or you. 
  [Zholdak] However, there was not even an alternative. You 
were there. 
  [Kravchuk] No, I was not present at the election, and even 
if 
I had been I would not have influenced the election in any way. 
We are democrats, after all. Or do you have a different position? 
  [Zholdak] Democrats we are. Now about something else. We 
have 
the Institute of Economics. Do scientists really work there who 
merely await advance pay dates and paydays? There were economic 
councils under you, too. Look, Markulov appeared to be sensible, 
but now he has slammed the door. 
  [Kravchuk] Oh no, he did not slam the door. He simply took 
another job on his own initiative. Everybody has such a right. 
  [Zholdak] Why can you not gather together the wisest 
economists here, lock them in the same room for a month, and 
tell them: You will sit here until you come up with the right 
way--or bring in foreign economists? I may be putting it 
primitively.... 
  [Kravchuk] You know, at present I want just one thing, that 
you take my place and try to do everything you are saying. Then 
we would meet with you a month later, and I would ask you about 
the same, and I would not get an answer. I understand you. I do 
not have any complaints or hold grudges against anyone. The 
people also think the same way you do. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. We have been tinkering for two years, and 
have 
not been able to produce anything. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, look. Our economy.... We are frequently 
compared with Poland, the Czech Republic, or Slovakia. They 
could do it, it is said, and we cannot. They had their own 
states, their own complete economies. 
  [Zholdak] I will tell you why. I am not an economist. 
  [Kravchuk] Why? 
  [Zholdak] Because our state has control of 90 percent of 
enterprises and kolkhozes. Let them go! 
  [Kravchuk] It is not just that. Let me now show you some 
interesting data. 
  (He went over to his desk and picked up a printed sheet 
of paper with black and white marks.) 
  [Kravchuk] This is a privatization table from an 
international magazine. Look at the private sector. White marks 
denote 70 percent. Look at Austria. More than 70 percent has 
been privatized there--oil and coal. The rest belongs to the 
state. Black marks denote more than 70 percent of the "public 
sector." 
  [Zholdak] State-owned. 
  [Kravchuk] Public. So, look. There are states in which 
everything is in the "public sector." Brazil. Here is Great 
Britain--almost everything is in the "public sector" in the 11 
sectors named. 
  [Zholdak] Is that so? 
  [Kravchuk] France--almost everything in the "public sector." 
More than 70 percent. What are the sectors? Postal service, 
telecommunications, power supply, gas, oil, coal, railways, road 
construction, and steamship lines. Here are the main ones.... 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Eleven leading sectors--the 
"public sector." 
  [Zholdak] Let us look at America. 
  [Kravchuk] It has its own peculiarities. The level of 
privatization is the highest there. 
  [Zholdak] Here, look. Everything is white in America. 
  [Kravchuk] Not everything, but almost everything. 
  [Zholdak] And what about Japan? More white marks. 
  [Kravchuk] There are more white marks. Let us take Germany. 
You see, there are more black marks. I am driving all the time 
at privatization not being the only way out of the situation. 
The main point is for all forms of ownership to be equal, for 
equal conditions to be created for all. It cannot be that the 
director of state enterprises would pay wages of 200,000, and a 
commercial establishment next door--2 million. Conditions should 
be equal for all, for all forms. However, I agree with you that 
the state cannot carry the weight of the trade sector, consumer 
services, small enterprises, the garment and light industry, 
agriculture.... However, there is collective property, too. 
  [Zholdak] Agriculture is precisely what I am very much 
interested in. It is a fact that the financial and credit system 
of the country has broken down. I am saying this, and you will 
object, but I will now prove it to you. 
  [Kravchuk] I am not saying no. I am saying that it has 
broken 
down. 
  [Zholdak] All right. The current crop of agricultural 
products confirms this. Look, the state has ordered these 
products. The state was supposed to buy them. It also promised 
kolkhoz members resources on a preferential basis. The state has 
now gone bankrupt, it has taken all the grain, but has not paid 
either the billions or the trillions. In a conversation with me, 
Ivan Stepanovych confirmed that these are trillions. And the 
state is not paying back. This is the question for you, Leonid 
Makarovych. 
  [Kravchuk] Why not paying back? It is paying. 
  [Zholdak] Mere drops. It is not paying back. 
  [Kravchuk] It is. The state is paying back, albeit with 
difficulty, and will pay back. A different system for relations 
between the state and the agrarian sector has been approved for 
1994. It is supposed to ensure a new approach in order to 
somehow resolve these acute problems gradually. 
  [Zholdak] Mr. President, Academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who 
is 
also the political commentator of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, has 
proposed to lay taxes in kind on farms. He has informed you. In 
this case, the state will have an abundance of foodstuffs 
without spending money, just for taxes in kind. For example, I 
operate my own farm, and I am supposed to give the state 
one-third of the crop, depending on the quality of land. What is 
your view of this? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this should be calculated. This idea of 
Ihor 
Rafayilovych should be worked on. 
  [Zholdak] A farm could give the state a certain established 
proportion of grain or meat per hectare. It would be interested 
in increasing the output of products because a fixed, unchanged 
tax would be established. The greater the crop grown by 
peasants, the more they get to keep. This is advantageous to all. 
  [Kravchuk] However, this is natural economy rather than the 
market. This should be calculated properly. 
  [Zholdak] So, you approve of this idea? 
  [Kravchuk] As an idea that should be studied well, an expert 
analysis of which should be made. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, this is a painful question--how 
are we to get rid of speculators at every step we take? Can we 
really not give Minister of Internal Affairs Andriy Vasylyshyn 
the right to at least scare these middlemen? In the times of the 
communist era there was never such rapacity and fraud on our 
streets and squares next to railway terminals, as we have now. 
Those who tried to resell merchandise from stores were put 
behind bars right away. Now this is free, big business. If only 
they were peddling their own products. 
  [Kravchuk] Previously if they caught someone, they did not 
look at the law. They caught them and put them in prison right 
away. 
  [Zholdak] And why do Vasylyshyn's people not do it this way 
now? 
  [Kravchuk] Everybody must act in keeping with the law, and 
there should be good laws. 
  [Zholdak] The law is what it is, but if a store salesman 
passes, for example, detergents to "his people" through the back 
door, and these goods are sold at four to five times their 
price, is this not a crime? 
  [Kravchuk] Can you prove it? 
  [Zholdak] Next to the Ukraine department store in Kiev, 
close 
to the stop of street car No. 1, plump women sell one package at 
13,000-14,000; in the shop this merchandise costs 3,000, but it 
is not available. It is simple to prove that the street peddler 
did not manufacture the detergent powder herself. 
  [Kravchuk] She will say: "I bought it, and now I do not need 
it. And you do not have to buy it." There should be normal 
provisions and arrangements for their application, although the 
law enforcement organs are not doing everything by far. There 
are also other problems of democracy. For example, you bought a 
product in another country and brought it in for sale. You set a 
price. Those who want it, buy it, and those who do not, do not. 
This is your right. How is this speculation? This should not be 
put simply and primitively: If I am selling, this amounts to 
speculation. I agree with you on something else: If you buy 
something in a store and then go out and sell it right away, I 
am against it. However, this should be translated into law. If 
you follow closely the meetings of the Coordination Council for 
Combating Organized Crime, Minister Vasylyshyn and his guys are 
already doing nothing but this in order to cleanse our streets 
and squares in front of railway terminals from impudent 
middlemen. There is one more point: If economic conditions are 
not created, you will first establish control over yourself, and 
over the one who controls, and this chain may go on to the point 
of absurdity, because nobody has yet defeated either speculation 
or other criminal affairs by administrative legal control alone. 
  [Zholdak] Well, this did not happen during the communist 
era, 
comrade former secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine 
Central Committee. I maintain this as a former member of the 
CPSU. 
  [Kravchuk] There was another system, a system of a 
totalitarian regime. Pressure and lawlessness were the 
foundation of politics. 
  [Zholdak] Is anything at all allowed now? 
  [Kravchuk] No. 
  [Zholdak] Nonetheless, how are we to find bearings for the 
people so that they will live honestly and happily? 
  [Kravchuk] There is a way out. We should make a transition 
to 
such living conditions that it will no longer be advantageous 
for people to resell. 
  [Zholdak] It will not be advantageous when everything that 
we 
need appears in stores. 
  [Kravchuk] This is what it is about. I know from your 
writings that you have been to Paris. Tell me, did you see 
speculators on the streets and squares over there? Or did you 
see these shacks and stands with which the oblast seats, 
especially Kiev, are strewn? 
  [Zholdak] Paris and Kiev are not in the same league. 
  [Kravchuk] It will also be like this here. Ukraine will 
definitely become as rich as, say, France. Time is needed. The 
skill of economic management of our people is still the main 
point. I have met with the former president of Turkey, Ozal. He 
told me the following story: "Well, our flocks of sheep were 
driven to Iran all the time. We could not do anything. We set up 
borders, brought in the police, imprisoned the guilty 
executives, and so on. Nothing worked. However, what did we do 
later? We increased prices for our wool and hides. Prices became 
higher than in Iran. The sheep began to come over to us from 
there." Only economic instruments may really influence our 
situation. You see, there are 52 million people, and each of 
them wants to find his niche in life, including an economic 
niche. This is why it is impossible for General Vasylyshyn to 
assign a controller to everyone. 
  [Zholdak] It is so, Leonid Makarovych. However, when I see 
this abominable speculation in the streets (they even resell 
Polit cigarettes) my heart bleeds for the honest people who are 
being fleeced in this ungodly manner. They make millions in one 
or two days. May your heart bleed. We should fight such evil 
resolutely, after all. 
  [Kravchuk] Not only my heart bleeds. I do not want my heart 
to bleed.... 
  [Zholdak] I am saying this figuratively. 
  [Kravchuk] I understand; I want real work to be done. What 
we 
are now doing together with Minister Vasylyshyn and head of the 
SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] Marchuk is real. And we do it 
with the border guard, the national guard, and customs agents. 
There is material to disseminate. Consider this, Mr. Editor in 
Chief, and I would advise you to inform the people in your 
esteemed newspaper. This will benefit everyone. 
  [Zholdak] We have already established contact with General 
Valeriy Hubenko, commander of the border guard troops, and the 
head of our state customs, Mr. Anatoliy Kolos. We will provide 
information continuously. 
  [Kravchuk] Rightly so. I would like you and everyone to 
understand one thing: One may work by using these methods on a 
temporary basis. Why does this not exist in other countries? We 
want to prevent this under our circumstances. Meanwhile, our 
efforts should now be focused on production, without ruling out 
the fight against speculation. I talk about it all the time. 
Production is falling, but we want to live better. 
  [Zholdak] So, why is production not growing? 
  [Kravchuk] Production will increase if the state provides 
the 
conditions, and we are now working on it; this is the main 
point. However, second, when people begin to work as they 
should. Here is a simple and at the same time complex way out of 
the crisis for you and for all of us. 
<H5>  Will There Be Communism in an Isolated Oblast? </H5>
  [Zholdak] Mr. President, some power structures in certain 
regions of Ukraine are looking for another way out of the 
crisis. In short: As I see it, an intensified campaign from 
Russified oblasts in favor of the so-called experimental 
economic separation from the state strikes a blow at our 
independence. The Crimea has already been let go; the leaders of 
Transcarpathia have impudently come even to the Supreme Council, 
and the latter, instead of refusing to even hear about their 
separatism, up and began to discuss it and take votes. This 
"independence" petition nearly passed. Odessa with its Mr. 
Bodelan also plans to build communism in the "isolated Odessa 
region." Donetsk wants the same. Characteristically, Leonid 
Makarovych, all these authorities are former oblast-level 
Communist leaders. So, who is pulling apart our state? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us first determine what "separatism" is.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitry Korchinsky, leader of the Ukrainian </F>
National Self-Defence (UNSD) by MN correspondent Vladimir 
Gubarev: "Ukrainian Revolutionaries are Fond of Mao and 
Mussolini"] 
  [Text] What is UNSD? 
  UNSD is to me Ukraine's only organization for the protection 
of human rights which is utterly devoted to this cause. 
  This is the only revolutionary force which engages in real 
politics. The results of our activity include participation in 
two wars, organization of scores of strikes and the 
establishment of the Ukrainian Patriarchate and a military trade 
union. 
  Who supports you? 
  We rely on officers' circles and free trade unions. 
  What can you say about the relations between UNSD and 
Ukraine's official leadership? 
  The Ministry of Justice refuses to register us, and about 15 
of our men are currently being detained. But they can't do 
anything with us, times have changed and our strength has grown. 
The Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior can certainly muster more 
fighters than I, but when the minister gives an order he cannot 
be sure that it will be fulfilled, while I can count on the 
support of several thousand people who will die and kill without 
any pay. 
  In what wars did UNSD participate? 
  We took part officially on the Trans-Dniestrian side in 
Trans-Dniestria and on the Georgian side in Abkhazia and 
Mingrelia. We also received some practical experience in 
Azerbaijan and in the Balkans. 
  Why were your men on the Azerbaijanian and not the 
Armenian side? 
  We believe that Azerbaijan can become a friendly power to 
Ukraine, while Armenia is more in Moscow's sphere of influence. 
  Have you come to Moscow for a specific purpose? 
  My purpose is to search for allies, but I did not expect 
such 
a lack of the right people. As a matter of fact I was surprised 
during the October events how few defenders your Supreme Soviet 
had. Were it not for its foolish stand on the Crimean question, 
we alone could have sent more fighters than there were actually 
gathered at the White House. 
  MN Note: Shortly before the October events 
the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation transferred one of 
the Crimea's biggest cities, Sevastopol, to Russian 
jurisdiction. 
  You said once that the Crimea would be either Ukrainian 
or depopulated. What did you mean? 
  The Crimea is very vulnerable geographically. Even if there 
were no UNSD, the rupture of ties with Ukraine would lead to a 
catastrophe, for transport would not be able to operate and the 
supply of drinking water and electricity would stop. There would 
be no need to kill anyone, for everybody would flee on their own. 
  It is often said today that Ukraine's statehood will 
collapse. Do you agree? 
  We obtained independence much too quickly and had no time to 
form a revolutionary elite. But the absolute majority of the 
population is interested in independence. 
  An isolationist policy is impossible and undesirable, we are 
against a complete break with Russia, but Kiev must become a new 
strong geopolitical centre. The slogan of Slav unity remains 
basic to us, and we do not want Russia to become a battlefield 
between Jewish and Japanese capital. 
  Is a collapse in store for Ukraine? This is hardly probable. 
What may happen will be rather like the Polish variant. 
  Is that why you study the experience of Solidarity? 
  The most valuable experience for us is that of Lenin and his 
comrades in 1917. 
  Telegraph, telephone, the post and banks? 
  This is only the beginning of the building of the state. 
This 
is what happened in Germany in 1933 and in France when General 
de Gaulle came to power. 
  Who of the 20th-century politicians arouses your 
warmest feelings? 
  For UNSD fighters they are first of all Mao Zedong and 
Benito 
Mussolini. 
  MN File: UNSD emerged during the putsch of 
August 1991 as a force intended to resist the so-called State 
Emergency Committee which organized the putsch. At present this 
unregistered militarized organization has from 3 to 5,000 
members. About 500 of them took part in local wars. UNSD is 
amalgamated in the Ukrainian National Assembly. It has nominated 
120 candidates, mostly in Western Ukraine, for the forthcoming 
elections to the Ukraine's parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Goldenberg, deputy chairman of the </F>
Liberal-Democratic Party of Ukraine, by Vitaliy Vezhnin; place 
and date not given: "Let Us Shake Hands"] 
  [Text] A formerly unknown Vladimir Volfovich 
Zhirinovskiy once invited the Ukrainian liberals to shake hands. 
His potential allies responded, "We will go the other way." 
  [Goldenberg] This is a very interesting situation. I 
understand that the Russian media somewhat specifically explain 
the results of the elections in their country, and openly 
hesitate to speak of the victory of Yeltsin's opponents. About 
70 percent of the local press is subordinated to the president 
and the government. But what prevents the Ukrainian press from 
doing this? No publication has asked the Liberal-Democratic 
Party of Ukraine [LDPU] to comment on this issue. KIEVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI is a pleasant exception. I will repeat: The situation 
is paradoxical. Everybody comments on the victory of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], except LDPU. And we 
have a lot to speak about. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his people were very interested in 
Ukraine at one time, which is completely understandable. They 
invited the Ukrainian liberals and sought to establish solid 
ties. We immediately dissociated ourselves from them. This is 
why: Zhirinovskiy's party was not born in a vacuum. A few 
people remember its constituent congress. What advertising can 
do! I am absolutely convinced that it is an offspring of the 
USSR's special services and those who controlled their 
activities... It is known that an entire program for 
discrediting liberalism was once worked out. Gorbachev's ideas 
and his famous slogan about socialism with a human face were 
supposed to be more attractive for the people. Then suddenly, 
Vladimir Volfovich appears on the political horizon. "There is 
such a party!" Simultaneously with discrediting the idea, they 
received an argument with opponents of the multiparty system. It 
is not enough for you to have one party? You will get one 
more... There has been no liberal party in Russia after all. 
LDPR cannot be considered one. Zhirinovskiy's adherents, 
politely speaking, have nothing to do with democracy or 
liberalism. 
  In Ukraine, the situation is different. Our position is in 
many aspects upheld by the Constitutional Democratic Party and 
the Party of Free Peasantry. Together, we form the New Ukraine 
union. Our ideas are close to the Labor Congress of Ukraine 
and...the Party of Beer Lovers. Do not laugh, there is such a 
party. There is also the Liberal Party of Ukraine. There is 
nothing like that in Russia. LDPR is only a name, nothing more. 
  [Vezhnin] Nevertheless, in my opinion, Zhirinovskiy 
conducted the electoral campaign brilliantly. 
  [Goldenberg] I would not overestimate the success of 
Zhirinovskiy. Initial assessments show that representatives of 
the red-browns are in the minority in the Russian parliament. 
The voting was not only on party lists. Nevertheless, I agree 
that the success of Zhirinovskiy and [Russian communist leader] 
Zyuganov should be seriously taken into consideration. There 
are no LDPR structures in Ukraine today. 
  Yet, another threat exists. The term "zhyrynovshchyna" more 
and more often can be heard in politicians' lexicon. The 
Ukrainian legislature is not an exception. As soon as a deputy 
begins to criticize the party of power, he is instantly tagged: 
"This is zhyrynovshchyna!" I believe that this card will be 
actively played before the elections... 
  There is appropriate ground in Ukraine for those who would 
like to repeat Zhirinovskiy's success. However, I believe that 
extremist forces will not prevail. 
  [Vezhnin] No matter if somebody likes this or not, Vladimir 
Volfovich has ridden into the Russian legislature on a white 
horse. What chances will the Ukrainian liberals have in the 
upcoming elections? 
  [Goldenberg] Taking into account current realities, I 
believe that if 35 percent of democrats enter the new 
legislature it will not be a bad result. We hope that 
representatives of LDPU will be part of that 35 percent. 
  [Vezhnin] Do you not think that today's democrats, or more 
precisely, people who have proclaimed themselves as such, are 
losing their chances day by day? Let us be frank: Many of them 
rode into the Supreme Council on the tide of caveman 
anticommunism, inspiring us, common mortals, for the battle 
against privileges of the party nomenclature... Today, those 
democrats enjoy privileges, about which their predecessors could 
not even dream during the 70 years of communism, and are quite 
pliable in the hands of the old and new nomenclature. Are there 
any guarantees that the total disappointment with democrats will 
not lead another Zhirinovskiy to the political Olympus? 
  [Goldenberg] Do you claim that democratic deputies have been 
bought? This is very sad, of course. It is a pity that this is 
possible. The explanation is very simple -- this is due to our 
poverty. However, I would like to say something else. The 
people cannot forgive the deputies corps their cars bought at 
dumping prices, luxury apartments, and all-mighty privileges... 
But, nobody has ever admitted that not only certain deputies 
but also parties have sinned. 
  Analyze activities of our parties over the last two or three 
years. Read their various statements. Today, they criticize 
the president; tomorrow they will praise him for what he did 
yesterday. The people do not have to believe those who will 
deceive their expectations tomorrow. 
  [Vezhnin] If it is not a secret, who does LDPU believe 
should become president? 
  [Goldenberg] I will be frank. We would like [former Deputy 
Prime Minister] Volodymyr Lanovyy to become president of 
Ukraine. He is a man, to whom, we believe, there is no 
alternative in Ukraine today. 
  [Vezhnin] You must agree, that this sounds somewhat bizarre. 
Your party belongs to the New Ukraine union, whose leader is 
[former Supreme Council Speaker] Volodymyr Hrynyov. His latest 
statement on establishing the Interregional Reform Block with 
[former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma gives the former speaker 
very good chances. Taking into account the fact that Kuchma has 
recently been elected chairman of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, meaning that he has received 
unanimous support of this significant force, this team looks 
quite promising. Isn't it more logical to bet on a leader? 
  [Goldenberg] The Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc undoubtedly has a great 
chance, and it would be naive to deny this. Still, we are not 
going to bet on it. We have never considered the former prime 
minister an advocate of market reforms, and we do not approve of 
what has recently taken place. This is a mistake. I am talking 
about Hrynyov's position. The New Ukraine is on the verge of 
collapse today. This is sad and bitter, but real. Hrynyov's 
alliance with recent supporters of the nomenclature is a block 
of individuals, not parties. 
  By the way, our party successfully cooperates with Vladimir 
Popov [not further identified] on establishing his electoral 
bloc. We have been joined by the Union of Private 
Entrepreneurs, other serious structures, and, of course, the 
Fund for Restoring Ukraine's Economy. 
  [Vezhnin] Suppose you have managed to achieve your goals. 
Who could head the Cabinet of Ministers, given the new 
president? 
  [Goldenberg] It is possible that the president himself. He 
is a determined supporter of market reforms in Ukraine. This 
would undoubtedly be the most optimal variant.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergei Tikhy: "Crimea Opts for Moscow"; first </F>
paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The second round of the presidential elections in 
Crimea produced no surprises: 75 percent of Crimea's voters went 
to the polls and 73 percent of them voted for Yuri Meshkov. 
  MN File: Yuri Meshkov was born in 1945, his 
mother is Ukrainian and his father Russian. Graduated from 
Moscow University's Department of Law. Worked as a senior 
investigator at the Procurator's Office in Crimea which he was 
forced to quit because of an attempt to call some members of the 
party-managerial nomenklatura to account. Spent three years in 
the merchant marines. Then worked as a lawyer. Is a deputy to 
the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. Is married and has two 
children. 
  His rival, Nikolai Bagrov, polled 23.5 percent. These 
figures 
may be interpreted as a result of the referendum on whom Crimea 
belongs to, the conduct of which was one of the key planks of 
Meshkov's election programme. In effect, this means that Ukraine 
has missed its chance to strengthen its hold on the gift 
presented by Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 (cf. MN No. 3). 
  The main reason behind such election returns is not the fear 
of growing Ukrainian influence in all aspects of life, the 
threat of which was used to scare the electorate (considering 
that one in five Crimean inhabitants is Ukrainian, only one in a 
thousand Crimean schoolchildren studies in Ukrainian). The main 
source of the Crimean electorate's sympathies and antipathies 
lies in whatever is known all over the world as the 
Ukrainization of the economy. 
  Meshkov won, but his victory boiled down to a questionable 
right to make the first move in a position amounting to a 
stalemate for everyone. 
  From his very first day in the post of President Yuri 
Meshkov 
will be severely limited in terms of time. Considering the 
character of his electors (it is easier to lose than win their 
sympathies), the President will have to work to secure a repeal 
of the moratorium on the referendum in Crimea so as to hold it 
on March 27, the day of elections to the Supreme Soviet of 
Ukraine and Crimea. Otherwise Meshkov risks not only his 
position, but even the chances for a parliamentary victory by 
the forces supporting him. Thus, less than two months has been 
allotted for the creation of the legal basis he has promised to 
rely upon in relation with Ukraine. Moreover, Meshkov will have 
to predicate himself on the following real circumstances. 
  Crimea depends economically to an even greater extent on 
Ukraine than the latter on energy imports. The question is not 
about something of secondary importance, but about fresh water 
and electricity. Crimea consumes one billion dollars' worth of 
electricity each year alone in terms of world prices. In the 
course of TV debates, replying to his opponent's blunt question 
about what he would do if Kiev cut off the supply of electricity 
to the Crimea, Meshkov confined himself to general words, 
claiming that Russia would not abandon Crimea. However, 
electricity cannot be delivered by tanker whereas the 
construction of power lines of corresponding capacity across the 
Kuban and the Kerch Strait will take at least three years. 
  The fulfilment of even the most fantastic of Meshkov's 
election promises, like the entry into the rouble zone, will all 
the same not produce anything economically unless political 
stability has been guaranteed in Crimea. Without it the 
peninsula's economic infrastructure, geared mainly to tourism, 
will be doomed to final degradation. 
  And besides, the newly-elected President's relations with 
the 
indigenous people -- Crimean Tatars -- have been hopelessly 
spoiled. The Tatars are today the only ethnopolitical force in 
Crimea which is organized in support of the status quo regarding 
relations with Ukraine. They supported Bagrov in the first and 
second rounds and their leader, Mustafa Dzhemilev, has already 
stated that Tatars will not regard Yuri Meshkov as their 
President. The Tatars have repeatedly declared that they alone 
have the legitimate right to national statehood in Crimea and 
are prepared to resort to any means should the situation be 
aggravated. 
  The results of Crimea's elections have already polarized 
Ukrainian public opinion. Any extreme moves by Meshkov to 
implement his programme are dangerous in this situation. 
  In the past two weeks Yuri Meshkov has publicly said that he 
maintains excellent contacts with the Russian leadership at the 
highest level. Though he gave no names, he stressed each time 
that the question was not about President Yeltsin. In the 
corridors, however, even names were mentioned --two days before 
the elections Meshkov cited the following list of his 
"contractors": Zhirinovsky, Communist Leader Zyuganov, 
representatives from the Agrarian Party... Unless this is a 
bluff, the politicians traditionally opposed to Boris Yeltsin 
and his team have got at their disposal a button with the help 
of which they can at any moment explode both Russian-Ukrainian 
relations and the inner political situation in Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by unnamed correspondent: "First Impressions: </F>
Telemarathon on Assigned Subject"] 
  [Text] A little less than a month remains before the 
elections to the Supreme Council, but the election campaign is 
still somewhat like the wind in the forest: there is much noise 
at the top while all is quiet at the ground level. The average 
voter has not yet become interested (because he has not had the 
opportunity) what kind of choice is offered to him today, or why 
the future Supreme Council will be better than the current one 
in reality and not in theory. Starting last Monday, then, 
Channel Two of the Ukrainian television began to review all 
registered movements and individuals. The television offered 
voters live coverage of candidates in the Pryrichnyy election 
district No. 14. 
  Let us state from the start that the candidates from that 
district (as well as their voters) struck out with this 
broadcast. First of all, because they were the first ones in 
this telemarathon. By the time the elections come around, the 
people (at least those who were able to see that broadcast) will 
have long forgotten their impressions of the candidates. 
Unfortunately, it fell to that district to go first. 
  It missed out on the broadcast time, as well. On this 
subject, candidate Georgiy Andreev declared openly that for this 
extremely important broadcast the Ukrainian television had 
purposefully selected the hour in which the smallest possible 
number of viewers would see their candidates. What is surprising 
is that under pressure from voters the Ukrainian television 
changed its schedule for other districts. 
  Finally, the organization of the broadcast also turned out 
to 
be the proverbial first try. The television not only failed to 
inform viewers about the candidates' platforms (even though the 
broadcast was called "Candidates' Platforms") but did not even 
make an effort to represent those respectable people as normal 
human beings. 
  Instead of showing us individuals, the program was dominated 
by guesswork, having put to the candidates a question (which 
sounded more like an attempt to embarrass them): who is still 
watching and listening to you? 
  If the goal of the Ukrainian television had been to 
discourage them, it achieved it fully.

<F P=106> [Article by the KNDS Information Press Service: "Rhetorical </F>
Question: What Is Happening to the Ukrainian Radio?"] 
  [Text] The results of diversity which we have inherited 
from the empire have been seen in the Crimea, where 54 percent 
of voters trusted Meshkov, a former champion from KGB troops. 
The current situation in the Crimea could have been avoided if 
the state had a consistent information policy. 
  Many journalists, especially those working for the Ukrainian 
radio, could not passively follow the flow of events. With great 
difficulty, they were able to make Channel One of the Ukrainian 
radio very interesting and objective. A wide selection of news, 
commentaries and programs such as "Independence" and "Two-Way 
Connection" suggested that the Ukrainian radio was becoming 
highly professional and national. But it wasn't long before the 
journalists' freedom and the listeners' ability to get full 
information were curtailed. 
  From January of this year, Channel One has changed 
drastically and for the worse. Many people want to know what 
happened. 
  Following staff changes at the State Television and Radio 
Company, moral pressure became real. It was suggested that the 
popular program "Independence" should be shut down. The program 
survived, but some of the people who worked on it had to either 
bend to the will of the new management or leave. They chose the 
latter. The time allotted to information and commentary on 
Channel One was cut to just three hours per day. Most of the air 
time, just as on television, is now taken up by songs and 
symphonies. 
  Who are those new managers who so eagerly promote folklore 
while at the same time muzzling local information? The first 
vice president of the company is former party secretary of the 
television service Zinoviy Kulyk. His experience on the air is 
limited, but I think many still recall his interview with 
Mikhail Gorbachev on 7 December 1991. By responding "yes, yes, 
yes" to Gorbachev's aggressive comments, he greatly embarrassed 
Ukrainian journalism. 
  Viktor Pasak is one of the company's vice presidents. He has 
been on the air much more often than Kulyk. In 1990, when on the 
initiative of the democratic forces the Supreme Council in Kiev 
was being picketed and other mass measures were taking place, he 
constantly complained about their poor behavior from the 
television screen. More recently, he was the host on the 
television program "1 December", which was distinguished by its 
idiosyncratic selection of guest participants. Now, say 
journalists, he took under his control Channel One on the radio. 
  This is why interested listeners are now forced to obtain 
information about the true situation in Ukraine, especially in 
the regions, either from Radio Liberty or from foreign 
Ukrainian-language broadcasts. Radio Liberty is not under the 
control of the presidential cohorts at the State Television and 
Radio Company, and the new managers have not yet touched foreign 
broadcasts. Unfortunately, in Ukraine, only a few regions, such 
as the Donbass, Kiev, the Crimea, Lvov and Chernigov, can 
receive them. 
  Today, journalists and sociologists are trying to explain 
why 
many people become increasingly apathetic about processes 
underway in the country, as a result of which centrifugal 
processes emerge in the regions. On the one hand, the economic 
situation has an impact on this, but on the other, it is caused 
by the lack of statewide information policy. The low level of 
broadcasts compels people to seek information from alternative 
sources. In the Crimea and Donbass such sources strive to 
discredit the idea of state and to develop the syndrome of 
disdain for national essence. Can it be that managers of the 
State Television and Radio Company do not understand this? 
  In any case, it is yet another proof that old specialists, 
trained under the old regime, cannot hold managerial positions 
in areas that are of strategic importance for the state-building 
process. Especially not in the economy and the mass media. 
Moreover, ignoring the latter leads to losses in the economic 
sphere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Orobets, candidate in technical </F>
sciences, by Roman [Kulchynskyy]: "Expert Opinion: `Despite 
Difficulties with Energy Sources, Gasoline Remains Ukraine's 
Main Export'"] 
  [Text] Gasoline is in short supply, there are 
shortages of electric power, trains and buses are cancelled, 
apartments are freezing and television broadcasts only in the 
evening: we are in the midst of an energy crisis. The 
nomenklatura blames it on the "disruption of ties" and "collapse 
of the Union". To explain the true causes of the severe crisis 
and how it could be solved we invited Yuriy Orobets, candidate 
in technical sciences and a specialist in managing the energy 
industry. 
  [Orobets] Our country is not particularly poor in energy 
sources. Coal deposits alone, even if worked intensively, could 
satisfy Ukrainian demand for more than two centuries. However, 
conditions in the coal industry as a whole do not meet current 
requirements. Twelve 12 percent of mines are older than 50 
years, while 60 percent have not been overhauled for the past 30 
years. These factors negatively impact on the production of 
fuel. Substantial investment is also required to modernize the 
industry. 
  The outlook is good also for brown coal deposits in the 
Dnieper basin. Especially since coal can be mined there the 
cheapest way: in open pits. Experts estimate that brown coal 
could yield 600,000 tonnes of cheap gasoline per year. 
  The situation is difficult in the oil and gas industry. The 
peak of its development in the Carpathian region and eastern 
oblasts is long past, and Ukraine supplies only 9 percent of its 
oil demand and 22 percent of its gas needs. It was the discovery 
of rich deposits in Siberia and Central Asia that lead to the 
contraction of exploration and development works here. Another 
negative factor was our ground yield coefficient for oil, which 
is low (but, nonetheless, twice as high as in the U.S., where 
geological conditions are similar.) 
  [Kulchynskyy] What is the cause of the energy crisis in 
Ukraine? 
  [Orobets] Supply and demand for energy have developed over 
the past 30 years without regard for world prices, which have 
the decisive impact on the development of energy producing and 
processing operations. This has caused an energy crisis not only 
in Ukraine and other new countries, but in Russia itself. 
  The discovery of rich deposits of oil and gas in Siberia led 
to the intensive production of light products, such as gasoline, 
kerosine and diesel fuel, and a huge quantity of heavy fuels. 
Moreover, low yields from refining were tolerated. Ukrainian 
refineries get only 40 percent of light fuels from processed 
crude, whereas US refineries get up to 70 percent. 
  The existence of rich deposits of inexpensive natural gas 
allowed us to bring gas to most cities and towns, and to use it 
widely in industry. The low prices on oil and natural gas were 
based on costs, and not set to match world prices. This 
principle resulted in the construction of a large number of 
cheap but wasteful energy using systems. 
  Unfortunately, delivery of oil and gas to Ukraine is being 
used by Russia to apply pressure in solving political problems. 
At the same time, Russia itself is experiencing a profound 
crisis of oil production. Output has declined by 40 percent. 
Therefore, from every point of view, Ukraine must find a general 
solution for other sources of energy. 
  [Kulchynskyy] What is the outlook for the development of 
hydroelectric and nuclear power? 
  [Orobets] Ukraine has resources to develop nuclear power, 
but 
the entire processing plant of the nuclear power industry is 
based in Russia. 
  As to hydroelectric power, our low-lying country with 
slow-flowing rivers would limit the development of this type of 
energy. This is why hydroelectric plants produce only 4 percent 
of power while their reservoirs take up hundreds of hectares of 
some of the richest black soil in the world. 
  [Kulchynskyy] Recently, in this country and the world over, 
the idea of using alternative sources has become popular. 
  [Orobets] The most realistic sources of alternative energy 
are, in practice, the energy of the sun, the wind, sea waves and 
photosynthesis. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to tap 
solar and wind energy. From the practical point of view, it is 
necessary to know exactly how much capacity must be in reserve 
for the period when there is no sun or when it goes behind 
clouds, or when there is no wind, and how long it will last. 
Taking into account these details, as well as the great 
expenditures required for the mass production of generating 
equipment, commercial production of this "free" energy turns out 
to be considerably more expensive than traditional sources. 
Along with wind-driven generators, the most promising is 
research in the production of fuel using photochemical and 
photobiological processes. Also, sun batteries can be used 
effectively. By the way, Ukraine produces and profitably exports 
them. Using alternative sources, the problem of supplying energy 
to some remote sites can be easily resolved. 
  [Kulchynskyy] In your opinion, can the energy crisis be 
overcome, or at least mitigated, using domestic capabilities? 
  [Orobets] Of course. To do this, we must first of all 
reorganize import and export of petroleum products. Despite 
difficulties with energy sources, gasoline remains Ukraine's 
main export. The theft of national property must be decisively 
stopped. Moreover, for various reasons, energy is used very 
ineffectively. Measures to save energy can be divided into two 
categories. The first category consists of organizational 
measures, which entail the introduction of strict discipline and 
order in industry. The second category is the development of 
technical measures to reduce energy intensity in industry. The 
first category of measures can be implemented very rapidly. 
Moreover, privatization would accelerate this process. This can 
save 5-to-7 percent of electric power and 10-to-15 percent of 
energy used for heating. The implementation of the second 
category of measures will bring results that are 2-to-3 times 
greater, but here, major investment and considerable 
reconstruction will be required. 
  Ukraine is building an oil terminal near Odessa, the first 
line of which will begin operation in October of this year. We 
must also explore the possibility of bringing in oil through 
Baltic ports, using the pipeline system in Belarus. In the 
future, we could export light fuels produced by the excess 
capacity of our refineries. For this, however, investments are 
necessary to raise yields. It is extremely important to reduce 
the use of gas and heavy fuels in producing electric power. The 
necessary condition for this is to modernize our coal-burning 
plants, first of all by installing boilers using nontraditional 
methods to burn solid fuels with a high soot content. But 
Ukraine produces no such boilers. 
  [Kulchynskyy] What would you like to see happen in the 
industry? 
  [Orobets] To rebalance our fuel and energy complex will 
require much work and, as you have already seen, considerable 
investment. To attract it, we need a strong government comprised 
of specialists and reformers whose deeds would not differ from 
their words.

<F P=106> [Commentaries by Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the "New </F>
Ukraine" coalition, and Viktor Pynzenyk, chairman of the 
Ukrainian Fund for Supporting Reforms, edited by H. Pyvovarov: 
"Do We Have a Chance To Stop our Fall Into the Economic Abyss?"] 
  [Text] I asked Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the "New 
Ukraine" coalition, and Viktor Pynzenyk, chairman of the 
Ukrainian Fund for Supporting Reforms, to answer the following 
three questions: 
  1. Do you see a way to resolve the current critical 
situation? 
  2. Under simultaneous inflation and stagnation, is it 
expedient to regulate the monetary-financial system without 
reanimating industries and agriculture? 
  3. Is it expedient to introduce the hryvna [national 
currency] under the current economic circumstances? 
<H3>  Volodymyr Hrynyov: "People Cannot Stay Long in an Abyss of 
Despair" </H3>
  1. Before answering this question, I want to ask another 
one: 
What kind of reform did Gaydar carry out in Russia? People call 
it shock therapy or monetarism, but it is the pace of reform 
that matters. Gaydar's reforms were rapid from his point of 
view but slow from the perspective of their objective necessity. 
In my opinion, reform in post-communist countries can only 
survive if it is carried out expeditiously, because people 
cannot stay in the abyss of despair too long. Of course, 
society is not a column of soldiers where everyone can be put in 
one line and told to move in one direction. Well-being of all 
its members cannot grow simultaneously. Some people are bound 
to get rich quicker, while others will get more and more poor; 
inefficient enterprises will be closed down, and unemployment 
swell. Unfortunately, nobody ever invented a way to realign the 
economy to market tracks avoiding social cataclysms. 
  Analyzing the situation in Russia where reform, unlike in 
Ukraine, was finally launched, one comes to the conclusion that 
it did not start there on time either. Financial stabilization 
was carried out in fits and starts, and was accompanied by cases 
of credit emission. 
  I am referring to the mistakes in Russian reform to avoid 
similar ones in Ukraine. The first conclusion is -- reform must 
be carried out promptly. However, how rapidly should this be 
done to avoid social flare-ups? 
  Being a technocrat, I know that sound travels at different 
speeds in different media and attempts to accelerate this 
process may ruin the latter. The same can be said about reform: 
It should be carried out as rapidly as the social situation and 
people's mentality allow it. As I said, there always will be 
people dissatisfied with the heavy burden of reform. Thus, 
economic reform should be carried out on the "threshold" of 
people's patience and readiness to carry its weight. If reform 
slows down, this may lead to the accumulation of discontent and 
thus, disrupt the process. At the same time, excessive speed of 
reform may result in the people's failure to understand the 
cause of the former. 
  I understand that your question is: What should we do in 
Ukraine to prevent this? In the first place, privatization must 
be carried out expeditiously. Ukraine is mature enough for mass 
privatization. One might say that in the West this process 
lasted decades. However, there is a big difference between us 
and them. Private property in the West has long existed and a 
normal process of economic development is under way. Thus, the 
Western variant of privatization involves the selling of 
facilities that have not been privatized by now. They have 
nowhere to hurry, while we want this process to be carried out 
rapidly. Why? Because we need a stratum of owners for 
alleviating social tension. Owners are quite different from 
beggars who have nothing to lose other than their chains. 
  The second important aspect is the creation of a land 
market. 
This market should not be limited to rural areas; land should 
also be sold in urban areas, where enterprises should be sold 
along with land to private owners, including foreigners. Today, 
we have the potential to inject financial means in the economy 
by using the real resources that we possess, including land, 
enterprises, and real estate. These are noninflationary means 
facilitating structural reshaping of which much is being said 
and little done. 
  I understand that we cannot embrace the entire economy with 
these stabilizing measures, and I have always advocated the 
forming of "stability islands" as the first step. Hopes that 
the economic giant malformed and destabilized for 70 years can 
be brought back to its feet in one rush, are futile. At the 
same time, we can initiate this process in special economic 
zones and territories where market mechanisms will be launched, 
including the functioning of securities, shares, bonds, and 
other components of a normal economy. 
  Yet, sticking to the ideology, we have been stubbornly 
trying 
to revive our economy by macroeconomic means. This is doomed to 
failure. Whether we want it or not, we will have to begin with 
reform in regions and stabilize the economy "bit by bit." This 
should be done on the basis of the entire system of markets -- 
those of land, capital, real estate, labor, and products. 
  2. We have always been told that priority should be given to 
production. This has become a part of our socialist mentality. 
Proceeding from this postulate, we have tried to expand 
production and now, we are as ardently attempting to save the 
latter. Yet, let us answer this question: Why save it? What 
advantages is this going to bring? Only those enterprises 
should be preserved that meet peoples' demands. We have no way 
to maintain production, other than subsidizing priority 
enterprises and branches vital for the economy. All others must 
take care of themselves. 
  Our "care" for production results in destroying the economy. 
In market economies the main goal is to sell a product not just 
manufacture it. 
  The rapid formation of a class of owners is not sufficient 
for enhancing the efficiency of production; on the contrary, 
this might have the opposite effect. However, this is a 
precondition for the optimal use of privatization money. This 
money can be spent on modernizing the capital stock and 
introducing new technologies. Enterprises will begin 
manufacturing products for which there is a demand, which can be 
rapidly sold and yield high profits. 
  This means that privatization is a priority in the creation 
of a market economy that would be stable and efficient. A land 
market is a necessary prerequisite for financial stabilization. 
An intensive flow of capital will create noninflationary 
sources for the structural reshaping of the production sector. 
  Finally, we should constantly explain to the people the 
meaning of all measures taken to reform the economy. Only then, 
can reform be carried out firmly and rapidly, supported by a 
majority of people. 
  3. The exhaustion of the coupon has become evident. This is 
why the demands to urgently introduce the hryvna are becoming 
louder and louder. Hopes that the new monetary unit will 
resolve our financial problems are very naive. 
  The power of national currencies does not depend on what 
name 
is printed on a piece of paper, but what material wealth backs 
it. Russia's raw materials, although sold at dumping prices, 
serve as the basis for the ruble. What basis do we have for 
stabilizing the hryvna? Our products might become such a source 
of stability, but only after they become competitive on foreign 
markets. 
<H5>  Viktor Pynzenyk: "Not Until We Stop the Printing Press...." </H5>
  1. The opinion that we do not know how to overcome the acute 
crisis appeared not due to a lack of programs or their erroneous 
nature, but due to a stalemate in implementing them. Thus, the 
question is not how to exit the situation but how to persevere 
in reshaping the economy. 
  There can be disputes over the sequence of reforms, but 
stopping the money-printing press is undoubtedly the first thing 
that must be done. Without this, fighting inflation is out of 
question. Trillions of karbovanetses are being printed every 
month. Production is not expanding, while the volume of money in 
circulation is increasing on a daily basis. This results in 
skyrocketing prices. The postulate that the more money is 
printed the larger the purchasing power, is false. We cannot 
consume more products than we manufacture. No matter how often 
the price of bread is increased, the number of loaves will not 
double. 
  The budget deficit is one of the main causes of the 
increased 
printing of money. Our state's money supply is represented by 
two components: 20 percent of it is cash, and 80 percent noncash 
money. Suppose, the National Bank declares that they are putting 
an additional two trillion into circulation. In fact, this 
money is not printed; it is only added to bank accounts. Thus, 
by stopping the printing presses we will deliver a heavy blow to 
the budget deficit. 
  This cannot be done instantaneously, just as it is 
impossible 
to stop a speeding car at a moment's notice. In the economy, we 
need time to gradually slow down the process of printing money 
and thus, curb inflation. 
  Financial stability will limit credit emission and reduce 
budget expenditures. On the other hand, bureaucrats will be 
devoid of the possibility to abuse authority and embezzle state 
property. 
  Having stopped the printing of money we will eliminate 
profiteering on inflation processes. Take this example: A 
state-run store purchases a shipment of recorders costing 
100,000 karbovanetses each and then holds off on selling them. 
Due to inflation, the price hits 300,000 by the end of the 
month. Will the store sell the recorders at the new price? 
This will bring no profit. They make a deal with a private 
store owner and sell him the recorders for 300,000 a piece. In 
this case, the state and private storekeepers will each receive 
100,000. Such redistribution of profits has become a 
commonplace phenomenon. The larger the difference between the 
purchase and selling price, the larger the "shadow" 
redistribution. In this case, administrative control is 
helpless. 
  The solution lies in privatization and the appearance of 
private owners. The latter will not let anyone profit at his 
expense. He will officially conduct the revaluation of his 
products, being interested in earning more money. He will also 
pay a higher tax to the state. 
  Ukraine also needs major changes in the sphere of foreign 
economic activities. We are in need of so many different 
products, especially power resources! However, we need larger 
exports to have money to buy more products abroad. Our exports 
are tied up with quotas, licenses, and taxes. Today, when 
prices on domestic and international markets are commensurate, 
there is no economic justification for preserving quotas. The 
only way to regulate exports is by increasing export duties. 
  Returning convertible currency to the state is an important 
problem. When people know for sure that their hard currency 
assets are not devaluating, bringing money back [to Ukraine] 
will be advantageous. Otherwise, the mass flow of capital out 
of the state will continue. Only economic stabilization can 
bring the money back. 
  Due to ill-suited foreign economic policies, exporting 
products becomes unprofitable. Buying hard currency from 
producers at a fixed price, the state has in fact imposed an 
additional export tax. Who will trade with foreign countries 
under such conditions? 
  This brings us to the idea of a deregulated exchange rate 
for 
hard currencies, which is a normal measure throughout the 
civilized world. Now, the question is how to make imports 
advantageous for the state. 
  Suppose I have received money for purchasing oil, but buy 
cigarettes and chewing gum instead, claiming that my counterpart 
abroad has no oil. In this case, economic mechanisms should be 
enacted, including high customs duties of 100 or even 200 
percent. This is the way to protect native producers. 
  A lot of economic notions meet with uncivilized perverted 
interpretation in our state. Accompanied by credit emission, 
the deregulating of prices is lethal for society in the current 
situation. When we manage to avoid emission, the situation will 
normalize. How? 
  If I have 40,000 karbovanetses in my pocket, no matter how 
hard you try you cannot take more out of it. Setting prices 
free and limiting emission will reduce demand and curb prices. 
However, so far, we have been limiting cash payments by 
limiting wages, while noncash emission has been at the same 
level. Thus, wholesale prices have been increasing bringing 
about increases in retail prices. 
  Neither should we be afraid of bankruptcy. Thousands of 
enterprises go bankrupt in the United States every year. 
Bankruptcy in market economies merely amounts to a change of 
owners. A new owner comes, injects new funds, reorganizes and 
modernizes the enterprise and technologies, and the enterprise 
becomes profitable again. 
  2. Regulating the monetary-financial system without 
reanimating industries and the agriculture is impossible. What 
are the advantageous spheres of activity these days? Production 
is not one of them, because it entails huge expenditures and 
does not rapidly yield profits. This explains the recent 
dramatic decline in investments. Given our high inflation that 
exceeds interest rates on credits, it has become very profitable 
to buy products and keep them. 
  First, measures must be taken to make subsequent selling of 
the same product unprofitable. To achieve this, the interest 
rates on credits should exceed inflation. This will resolve the 
problem of people's savings. People will find it advantageous 
to deposit money in banks aware that in a year they will be able 
to buy more for the same sum. 
  If inflation is reduced, so will interest rates. Then, 
investing in production may become profitable again unlike 
middleman operations. Thus, we can revive production only by 
stabilizing the financial system. 
  3. Ukraine has its currency called the coupon, while its 
noncash equivalent is called the Ukrainian karbovanets. Calling 
it dollar or hryvna will not change the situation. The power of 
money does not depend on its name; it depends on the state's 
policy toward it. What will the introduction of the hryvna 
change if the printing press is not stopped? Thus, it is a 
delusion to believe that a change in the name of Ukraine's 
national currency will improve the economic situation. I am 
afraid that this populist step will be made. The hryvna's 
introduction has been so much talked about that people started 
to pin their hopes on it. However, no such experiments should 
be conducted with people. 
  First, we must halt inflation. Italians, Poles, or the 
Japanese are not worried over the exchange rates of their 
national currencies because these rates are stable. Neither 
would we worry had the price of the U.S. dollar in Ukraine been 
stable. What ails me however, is that the printing of money is 
devaluating the coupon more and more. Under these conditions, 
the fate of the hryvna will be the same. 
  Our experts have lately been moving toward confiscation-like 
monetary reform. The claims that this alone can stabilize the 
national currency are ridiculous. They believe that 9 trillion 
karbovanetses are "wandering" in Ukraine. On the one hand this 
is not a huge sum, taking into account current inflation rates 
and prices. On the other hand, this money is not "wandering," 
because people prefer to buy a couple of dollars to save their 
money from inflation. 
  There is no technical justification for this kind of fiscal 
reform. This would be a merely technical act: 10,000 coupons 
will be exchanged for one hryvna and the latter will be declared 
hard currency. However, over one month inflation will "soften" 
this currency so much that the hryvna will have the same 
"battered look" as the unliked coupon. 
  Money printing is a continuous process -- once you do it you 
cannot stop. The hryvna can only be introduced after inflation 
is curbed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Goncharik, chairman of the </F>
Belarusian Trade Union Federation, by Galina Nikolaychik; place 
and date not given: "Strong Power Always Needs Strong Trade 
Unions"] 
  [Excerpts] 
  [Nikolaychik] Trade unions believe that it is their 
obligation to respond to every harsh measure taken by the 
government by way of declarations, protests, and strikes. 
However, one gets the impression that this is like tilting at 
windmills: The government pays little attention to the reaction 
of the most numerous public organization in terms of membership. 
How do you assess relations between trade unions and the 
government? Are you satisfied with them? 
  [Goncharik] I am dissatisfied because I believe that the 
results of our dialogue could have been weightier. This will be 
possible only when the government reviews its economic and 
social policies, and introduces serious corrections to the 
latter in accordance with our postulates. We have certain 
accomplishments, but soaring prices and inflation only nullify 
them. For example, on New Year's eve, we were informed of the 
planned threefold increase in prices for dairy products and 
municipal services. This is being done when enterprises face 
work stoppages and workers are not being paid. The Trade Union 
Federation Presidium called a session and adopted an appeal in 
protest against these measures. The government backed out and 
the price increase was postponed. We understand that the 
postponement is temporary, but given the fact that the Supreme 
Soviet has rejected our proposal to establish the minimum wage 
of 35,000 rubles as of 1 December, our fight was not futile. 
  [Nikolaychik] Do you correct your strategy and slogans 
taking into account the experience of your struggle? 
  [Goncharik] You might have noticed that the federation has 
altered its position -- while maintaining our economic claims we 
have decided to concentrate our efforts on resolving more global 
issues. Some branch trade unions are demanding wage increases. 
However, without making our production more efficient, this 
measure will only fuel inflation and become a heavy burden on 
all of society. Competent legislation is one of the factors 
that can facilitate the development of production. In light of 
this, we are actively working at Supreme Soviet sessions along 
with industrialists and entrepreneurs drafting documents 
regulating taxation and favorable credits. Discussions are 
under way regarding the adoption of a general agreement between 
the government, trade unions, and employees. In particular, we 
have agreed to include in this document the share of wages in 
the gross domestic product (it was decreased from 26 to 19 
percent). 
  Another thing that I would like to point out is that 
disregarding reproaches voiced by many parties, we have put 
forward political claims. This does not contradict our charter 
which says that we can participate in elections. 
  [Nikolaychik] Opinion polls conducted by trade unions have 
demonstrated that more than 700,000 voters advocate early 
elections. It is strange that this figure made no impression on 
the deputies who behaved as though nothing really happened. 
  [Goncharik] These 700,000 voices will sound again when the 
session resumes its discussion of elections. The more so that 
Lukashenko's anticorruption report did not contribute to the 
prestige of power. We are receiving letters from enterprises 
and very often only 10 people out of 2,000 oppose early 
elections. 
  Only a blind man fails to see the abnormality of relations 
between the Supreme Soviet and the government. It is really 
unnatural that the parliament and the government have 
diametrically opposing viewpoints regarding many issues of vital 
importance, including relations with Russia. 
  The new legislature will form a new government, but this 
does 
not mean that everybody will be discharged. People able to work 
and think will confirm their right to be deputies, ministers, 
and the like. Many deputies support the idea of early elections 
and suggest a mechanism for holding them. However, when these 
people gather in the session hall, the instinct of 
self-preservation prevails. I think there are two reasons for 
this: Many deputies simply fail to comprehend the danger of the 
current situation in the Republic, while others are trying to 
keep their cushy jobs. 
  [Nikolaychik] Suppose early elections are called. What 
stance will trade unions take; what political parties will they 
stake? You, for one, are known to support the Social-Democratic 
Assembly.... 
  [Goncharik] We support this party's socioeconomic platform. 
The Trade Union Federation is now drafting its election 
platform. The system of elections is also relevant. Most 
likely, the elections will be held in districts with candidates 
being nominated by parties. This is why we are considering the 
possibility of electing people with similar standpoints to the 
new legislature. Our goal is to have a group of workers in the 
Supreme Soviet. 
  We will seek support from centrist parties -- the Party of 
People's Accord and its social-democratic wing, the Scientific- 
Industrial Congress, and the Labor Party. The formation of a 
trade union party -- the Democratic Labor Party -- is currently 
under way. We will support this bloc. Our platform stipulates a 
socially oriented market economy with active protection of 
workers' rights and guarantees of their well-being. We want 
Belarus to be a flourishing state; that is why we have suggested 
that aside from the definitions "unitarian" and "democratic," 
our constitution includes formulas such as "social" and 
"sovereign". 
  [Nikolaychik] Judging by our conversation, there is no 
incongruity between trade unions and politics. Could trade 
unions assume responsibility for the state of things in Belarus? 
  [Goncharik] I do not think such a situation is possible in 
immediate future. 
  [Nikolaychik] Even theoretically? 
  [Goncharik] I am not an advocate of such a solution. 
Everybody should perform his functions. Our political 
activities are limited to participation in elections and 
electing politicians able to meet working people's demands. The 
experience of Poland demonstrates that under certain 
circumstances, trade unions can come to power. However later, 
they begin to fight trade unions. I also know this from the 
Israeli experience. The Israeli Trade Union, Gistradut, and the 
Labor Party are in fact one body. They have come to power and 
are facing problems. The state has specific restrictive 
functions that do not coincide with interests of groups and 
organizations. Clashes are inevitable. [passage omitted) 
  [Nikolaychik] How do you assess prospects for the 
development of the ruble zone? 
  [Goncharik] There are no doubts that today we should follow 
this path. We can waste no more time. For a certain period, 
people will feel an improvement; products will become cheaper 
and mutual payments will be simplified. However, what will 
happen then? We should make good use of the breather we will 
get. If we want Belarus to become a sovereign state, the 
Republic should adopt a national currency sooner or later. If 
we follow the path of simple integration in Russia's economy, we 
must accept political integration as well. Our sovereignty will 
be very feeble; we will become Russia's appendix and autonomous 
part. In my opinion, this would be a very dangerous scenario. 
We need political wisdom to walk this slippery path and not 
fall into an abyss. The Belarusian people are historically 
oriented toward Russia. Enterprise managers unilaterally 
support a union with Russia. However, we must pursue our 
national interests and sovereignty must be the cornerstone of 
our policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Sychow, Belarusian Ambassador to </F>
the United Nations, by Leanid Lakhmanenka; place and date not 
given: "United Nations Is Currently Experiencing a Renaissance, 
and We Should Take Advantage of This for the Benefit of Belarus"] 
  [Excerpt] Alyaksandr Mikalayevich Sychow is a professional 
diplomat. He was born in Homel, where he completed his high 
school education. He graduated from the Moscow Institute of 
International Relations. Sychow has been working at the 
Belarusian Foreign Ministry for 15 years. He has gone up all 
rungs of the diplomatic ladder, from attache to deputy foreign 
minister. He worked at the Belarus Diplomatic Mission to the 
United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva. 
Alyaksandr Sychow speaks English, French, and Spanish. 
  [Lakhmanenka] Alyaksandr Mikalayevich, what is the 
attitude of the United Nations attitude toward Belarus in 
general? I believe that it is not very good. I have drawn this 
conclusion, for example, from the fact that the amount of our 
financial contribution to the United Nations has been increased 
at a time when our economy is being transformed into a market 
economy, and our Republic is spending huge amounts of money on 
eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Now we 
are supposed to contribute more than certain other European 
countries, that are in much better shape than we. Why? I have 
the impression that you have been sent to New York to ease the 
situation. Is that true? 
  [Sychow] I believe that the world's attitude toward us, and 
the way we are treated by international organizations, reflects 
the real position of Belarus in the international community. To 
say that we are treated by them deliberately unfairly is, to say 
the least, unjustified. I must, however, frankly admit that we 
have certain grievances against the United Nations. 
  The news about the increase in our contribution to the UN 
budget was received rather bitterly in our Republic. I think 
that the UN General Assembly was too formal when it voted on the 
increase. The same lot also befell our southern neighbor 
Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union. If you 
do not mind, I would like to dwell on this issue, particularly 
since this has not always been reported or described 
objectively, including by the press. 
  [Lakhmanenka] Excuse me, but I think that our readers 
would also like to know your viewpoint. Although much has been 
said about this unpleasant surprise, people do not know enough 
about all the reasons behind this -- to put it politely -- 
unpopular UN decision. 
  [Sychow] There are several aspects to this problem. When 
the distribution of the Soviet Union's contributions among the 
countries established on the territory of the Union was 
discussed, the UN Committee for Contributions dealt with the 
issue mechanically. An entire range of procedural and 
methodological miscalculations and errors were committed. 
Moreover, the committee fulfilled the recommendation of the 
so-called "powerful" states which did not want those 
contributions to be distributed among other UN member states. 
  According to procedures, additional contributions by new 
members and the amount that is lost when a country leaves the 
United Nations should be dealt with and distributed taking into 
account the entire amount of the contributions. As a matter of 
fact, the amount would have had to be reexamined, and this, 
believe me, is very hard work. The committee, of course, 
preferred to avoid this task. 
  Russia's stance played no small role in this. The Russians 
wanted to shed the financial responsibilities inherited from the 
USSR as quickly as possible. 
  It was not taken into account that Belarus and Ukraine were 
among the founders of the United Nations. Nobody paid attention 
to the fact that the UN General Session, which preceded the UN 
General Assembly, had earlier defined Belarus' contribution at 
0.31 percent of the UN budget. 
  What did the committee recommend in this situation? It 
distributed the Soviet Union's contribution among the former 
Soviet republics in the same way as the USSR's foreign debt was 
divided among the CIS countries. To avoid additional 
contributions, Belarus and Ukraine were included in the list. 
This was improper in terms of legality and procedure. 
  An abnormal situation was thus created. Belarus and Ukraine, 
countries that had been among the founders of the United 
Nations, were treated like new members. 
  There is another interesting aspect to this issue, which is 
glossed over in silence by media observers. Today, the issue of 
Belarus' contribution is being related only to the activities of 
the Foreign Ministry, while the most important fact is being 
kept concealed: The contributions by a member country are 
estimated on the basis of its GNP, its population size, and the 
ruble's exchange rate against the dollar for the last ten 
years of economic development. 
  It is 1994 now, and the basis for estimates begins from 
1984. 
The economic performance of our Republic was different then. 
Therefore, the economic situation in Belarus looks generally 
better than in Greece, Hungary, and many other countries. As 
you know, the economic situation is actually not so rosy in 
Belarus. 
  The reasons behind the overestimated contribution lie in the 
Soviet heritage and statistical data that did not reflect the 
levels of economic development. Do you think it is easy for the 
Foreign Ministry and its officials to defend their position on 
the contribution when there are no reliable state statistics? 
  On the other hand, although the Baltics -- Latvia, 
Lithuania, 
and Estonia -- believed that their contributions would amount to 
0.01 percent, they are, respectively -- 0.13, 0.15, and 0.07 
percent. It was the same situation with Kazakhstan, Moldova, 
Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and other CIS countries. In those 
countries, however, they are not looking for scapegoats, but are 
trying to put together appropriate statistics. 
  The issue of contributions to the UN budget is very complex, 
and is connected with the activities of various state 
institutions, first of all, the State Committee for Statistics, 
the Finance Ministry, the State Committee for Economic Planning, 
and the National Bank, which define the above-mentioned figures. 
  [Lakhmanenka] As they say, what happened, happened. 
Has our country really put up with this unfair decision? Is 
there nothing left for us to do but wave our arms in a gesture 
of helplessness? 
  [Sychow] Of course, we will not be sitting idly, as certain 
politicians and observers are predicting. First of all, the 
Republic of Belarus has not recognized this decision, and it is 
not going to pay the contribution that was calculated according 
to the reexamined scale. Moreover, we have not recently 
transferred a single dollar of the additional amounts to the UN 
accounts. Our Republic endorses the special position on 
financing peacekeeping operations from the UN budget. 
  Thanks to the efforts of our diplomats at the latest UN 
session, recommendations for formulating a new scale of 
contributions for 1995-1997 were approved, and the 
methodological mistakes that were committed with regard to 
Belarus and Ukraine will be taken into account in the future. 
This way, perhaps the entire scale of contributions will be 
reexamined. However, we see certain obstacles that are 
connected with the data on our economic development. Compromise 
has almost been reached that the basis for calculations will be 
reduced to seven or eight years. This gives good grounds for 
reducing our contribution to the UN budget. 
  [Lakhmanenka] Well, although the problem of 
contributions has been more or less clarified, it is still not 
clear how we were "routed" in the elections for the UN Security 
Council. Belarus, as you have already said, is one of the UN 
founders. All Belarusian diplomacy was connected with the 
activities of UN international bodies. The Republic's image in 
the eyes of the international community is quite good following 
its abandonment of nuclear weapons, and suddenly such a failure 
occurs. Why? 
  [Sychow] I would not dramatize what happened in the 
elections and say that it was a big failure that Belarus was not 
elected a member of the UN Security Council. The defeat of any 
state in the elections is not considered by the United Nations 
as something extraordinary. For instance, Sweden, which 
commands great authority and has been neutral for a long time, 
lost in the elections to New Zealand. Nevertheless, Sweden has 
not lost its world prestige and influence. 
  We have analyzed the situation very carefully and have drawn 
our own conclusions. I would like to point out that the results 
of elections reflect the actual rating of Belarus in the world. 
This is a specific evaluation of our country. However, we also 
see this as a certain line in relations with CIS countries. For 
example, Kazakhstan lost the elections for the UN Economic and 
Social Council, and Russia was not elected chairman of the 
UNESCO Executive Council. 
  Regarding these elections, the principle of rotation was 
breached in our regional group. There is a UN rule that 
candidacies are discussed in regional groups. For example, 
along with the West European, African, Latin American, and Asian 
groups, there is also the East European one including Belarus. 
Earlier, it comprised 10 countries, now it has 20. 
  Every state has the right to be represented in the Security 
Council. We applied for membership in the Security Council in 
1987. Prior to that, Belarus had only once been a member of the 
council -- from 1974 to 1975. It must be said that we always 
respected other countries and made room for them. This time, 
however, we decided to put forward our candidacy. 
  Later, Czechoslovakia also proposed its candidacy. When such 
a situation occurs, it should be discussed within a group to 
avoid extensive competition. In the first place, we agreed with 
Czechoslovakia that it would withdraw its candidacy for our 
benefit, since it had already been a member of the Security 
Council two times -- most recently from 1978 to 1979. Certain 
countries from our group have been members three or four times. 
  Czechoslovakia, however, was soon divided into the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia. The leadership of the Czech Republic 
decided to argue over seats in the Security Council. Although 
we held numerous consultations with the Czech Foreign Ministry, 
we did not reach any compromise. 
  [Lakhmanenka] These are very interesting details. We 
do not know much about the mechanism of UN operations. I think 
that the Czech Republic won the elections not only because it 
put forward its own candidacy. It also conducted a secret 
electoral campaign, as everybody knows. 
  [Sychow] The situation that existed in the United Nations at 
that time did not guarantee us victory. Many subjective and 
objective reasons prevented our victory. I would relate the 
subjective reasons to the fact that Belarus' contribution to the 
improvement of global security and disarmament is not adequately 
appreciated in the world. The West's rigid assessments of 
Belarus' economic and democratic reforms and statements that we 
are following Russia's foreign policy also played an important 
role. I do not, however, agree with these opinions. 
Unfortunately, all this was taken into account during the vote. 
  The lack of ability to conduct appropriate work at our 
embassies was the real reason why we lost the electoral race to 
the Czechs. Wile the Czech Republic has more than 70 embassies, 
we have only 14. 
  We must also not forget the popularity of Czech President 
Vaclav Havel as a politician and a person. The activeness of 
the Czech side was amazing. On the eve of the vote, the Czech 
prime minister toured Latin American countries where he tried to 
garner some support. During the last three days before the 
elections, the Czech side conducted intensive preparations and 
even "worked on" certain politicians. Havel telephoned [former 
Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich. The Czech 
authorities even sent a special envoy to Stanislav Shushkevich 
to influence him. 
  Our side did not show such activeness. The work was 
conducted at the level of prime minister and foreign minister, 
and when we asked the Supreme Soviet chairman to send a letter 
to the Czech president, he refused to do so. 
  [Lakhmanenka] In my opinion, you did not mention yet 
another important reason behind our hardships in the United 
Nations. Belarus was too long hidden under the shadow of the 
USSR, and it always played into the latter's hands. This made 
people suspect that we would continue to do the same. 
  [Sychow] I would not be so adamant on this issue. 
Naturally, all our activities were coordinated and approved 
when we were in the USSR. However, even then our Republic came 
forward with many resolutions and initiatives that were later 
adopted by the UN General Assembly, including the resolutions on 
Nazi criminals, new types of weapons of mass destruction, 
disarmament, human rights, scientific progress, etc. 
  [Lakhmanenka] Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, 
the experience of Belarusian diplomacy was reduced to 
participation in international organizations, and it was gained 
during the Cold War, a period of confrontation between the two 
former camps of capitalism and socialism. Although these camps 
no longer exist, the "combat" experience still remains. Does 
this not disturb our diplomats? 
  [Sychow] I do not agree with you. We do not have experience 
in bilateral relations. Belarus' achievement is undoubtedly it 
participation in multilateral diplomacy. This valuable 
experience is very useful for us today. Other countries of the 
former Soviet Union, other than Ukraine, do not have such 
experience. 
  As a professional diplomat, I am very concerned by the fact 
that we do not have enough cadres. We have a chronic lack of 
specialists. At the Foreign Ministry, people work 12-14 hours 
per day for a pitiful salary. It is the same situation in our 
foreign missions. 
  Our ministry employs only 125 people, while foreign 
ministries of the former Soviet republics employ three or four 
times as many, not to mention Russia. How can we work 
efficiently if we do not even have one expert for each country, 
not to mention the legal and legal treaty work and economic 
diplomacy that we should actively develop. We generally rely on 
enthusiasm today. I believe that the Supreme Soviet and the 
government should pay more attention to Belarusian diplomacy, 
because it is impossible to solve the numerous problems facing 
our Republic with our scarce resources. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Margus Zakharov, general director of Labor </F>
Market Department, by Gratsian Olshak; date and place not given: 
"Is Unemployment on the Wane?"] 
  [Text] How did the year go in the labor market? 
According to some forecasts, unemployment in Estonia was 
supposed to have reached disastrous proportions by the end of 
the past year. Specific figures were cited: The number of 
unemployed could reach as high as 200,000. Fortunately, the 
predictions did not come true.... 
  General Director Margus Zakharov of the Labor Market 
Department answered our correspondent's questions. 
  [Zakharov] To tell you the truth, we also expected the 
unemployment curve to start creeping upward in November, but we 
were wrong. I hope this does not sound incompetent, but we still 
do not know why the anticipated rise did not occur. There were 
tendencies toward this. Last year there were almost twice as 
many graduates of academic institutions and training schools, 
and they might have been expected to remain jobless. Our 
strained relationship with our neighbors, especially Russia, 
also could have caused a rise in unemployment--and an extremely 
substantial one at that. Russia's harsh measures terminated the 
livelihood of the people who were buying goods there and selling 
them in Estonia and engaging in petty contraband across the 
Russian border. These people, however, had acquired the kind of 
skills and experience that are appreciated by the new generation 
of employers, and they were not left jobless either. 
  Today we can say that what we are experiencing is not mass 
unemployment, but a structural variety of unemployment. In other 
words, a certain segment of the population is not working, but 
the number of job vacancies is quite high. Sometimes employers 
complain that they cannot find the right people for these jobs. 
To meet job requirements, the people who are out of work have to 
undergo retraining and change their views and attitude toward 
work. 
  People in Tallinn, incidentally, have already realized that 
they are personally responsible for their employment status and 
that they have to learn and master new occupations. This process 
has also begun in Narva and Sillamae. After all, Ida-Virumaa was 
also responsible for the lower rate of unemployment in the 
republic as a whole. 

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-020-28A>           Situation in Tallinn Labor Exchange by Months </FIG>





    [Olshak] Has the center of unemployment moved from 
northeastern Estonia to the south? 
  [Zakharov] Yes. The Estonian population of those regions, in 
contrast to the Russian-speaking residents of Ida-Virumaa, were 
not ready for this. The situation there today is quite 
stressful. People in Narva and Kohtla-Jarve knew they might lose 
their jobs and were emotionally prepared for this. Just a year 
ago, the resident of southern Estonia, on the other hand, was 
certain that he would still have his job even after others had 
lost theirs. The total number of unemployed people in Vorumaa 
today, however, is equivalent to more than 6 percent of the 
able-bodied adult population, and the figure is around 4 percent 
in the Polva and Valga districts. For the sake of comparison, 
the rate of unemployment in Narva is only around 1.5 percent. 
  [Olshak] But we have also heard other figures for Narva, and 
some have been absolutely unnerving.... 
  [Zakharov] I have to say this: I do not like it when people 
use unemployment statistics and play political games with human 
emotions in pursuit of their own goals. This is what happened in 
Narva and Ida-Virumaa. Unemployment was the stick with which 
politicians threatened the people. There is no question that 
things were difficult at the Krenholm factory and that many jobs 
were cut, but some people in Narva were actually fanning the 
flames: Everyone would be fired and no one would be paid any 
wages.... Meanwhile, the situation was even more critical at the 
"Dvigatel" plant, where there are, incidentally, just as many 
workers as at the Krenholm factory. Furthermore, the situation 
in Tallinn as a whole was no better than in Narva. People were 
being laid off from the shipyards and many other enterprises in 
addition to the "Dvigatel" plant. 
  People use different unemployment figures, but we should 
confine our discussion specifically to the people who are 
actively seeking jobs, are willing to begin work right away, and 
have applied for job placement services. If a person is actively 
seeking a position calling for his level of energy and 
knowledge, he is certain to be included in our statistics. Today 
there are 15,000 unemployed individuals in the republic--i.e., 
people collecting unemployment benefits--and another 18,000 who 
do not qualify for these benefits yet but have already asked for 
our help. 
  [Olshak] Exactly how many people came to you to find jobs in 
the past year? What kind of help did you give them? 
  [Zakharov] The Tallinn Labor Exchange received around 70,000 
requests for assistance, and some people applied more than once. 
We have a heavy workload. After all, ours is not the kind of 
exchange that buys or sells something.... We have to work with 
the individual to place him in the correct job--to look for a 
place where he might be able to find a permanent position or an 
opportunity for training or temporary work. A government decree 
passed in March stipulated that an individual who is assigned to 
a temporary position by the labor exchange is entitled to 
extended unemployed status. For the whole period of his 
temporary employment, he will collect benefits in addition to 
his earnings. Furthermore, we now have ways of stimulating 
hiring: We have money for training and a chance to subsidize the 
employer for half a year or a whole year if he cannot afford to 
pay the worker the minimum wage. 
  In any case, all of this resulted in the reduction of 
unemployment in the republic in the third and fourth quarters. 
There was a somewhat unexpected situation in the Tallinn Labor 
Exchange in September, when there were twice as many applicants 
as in August. Many people wearing leather jackets and sportswear 
came to the exchange to apply for an unemployment card. Quite 
frankly, we experienced a veritable onslaught. The reason was 
quite simple: Starting in September there was compensation for 
heating costs, and the unemployed were covered by a free medical 
plan. 
  [Olshak] Who is the typical unemployed person today, so to 
speak? Who has the least likelihood of finding a job: women, 
people with a higher education? 
  [Zakharov] Our studies indicate that the first cuts affected 
engineering and technical personnel, but now most of the 
unemployed are people without an education. If a person does not 
have a specialty, is not fluent in Estonian, and is uneducated, 
he will have difficulty finding work. Others having difficulty 
are people of pre-pension age--those who will be retiring in 
five years or sooner. Employers prefer young workers. In Tallinn 
these older individuals represented 25 percent of all of the 
unemployed in the second quarter of last year, the figure had 
already risen to 40 percent in the third quarter, and we still 
do not know what happened in the fourth. 
  [Olshak] What about the employers? Who are they? 
  [Zakharov] Last year it became clear that more than half of 
the employers are in the private sector. They are more likely to 
trust the labor exchange and make use of its services. 
Furthermore, competing firms are even willing to spend some 
money to find a good worker. State structures, on the other 
hand, are still hiring people either on someone's recommendation 
or on the basis of some other kind of affiliation. This practice 
is frequently counterproductive. 
  [Olshak] Are there really any state enterprises left that 
are 
hiring people instead of just letting them go? 
  [Zakharov] Yes, there are. Some examples are the railroad, 
the Port of Tallinn, and some large plants. We are happy about 
the recovery of the Baltic Shipbuilding Plant. It will be hiring 
around 100 people, but these will be specialists, and not just 
people with no particular profession. I hope that in this case 
we will be able to demonstrate our ability to act as good 
partners. We want to satisfy the plant's requirements, and we 
are willing to arrange for the instruction or training of the 
workers the plant needs. 
  [Olshak] Unemployment benefits now amount to 180 kroon. Do 
you expect an increase? 
  [Zakharov] That is a difficult question. Today these 
benefits 
and earnings from temporary jobs produce the same income as some 
permanent positions. Besides this, we must not forget that the 
amount of the benefits depends on the financial status of the 
state. 
  From the standpoint of national economic development, I feel 
that the main objective today is not higher unemployment 
benefits, but a larger training grant, so that the individual 
will not be "housebound," but will be able to travel, for 
instance, from his home in Kivioli to a training site in 
Kohtla-Jarve. This would be a good investment. 
  [Olshak] Here is the last question. What kind of year do you 
think 1994 will be in the labor market? 
  [Zakharov] It will be difficult, but not hopeless.

<F P=106> [Article by Elkond Libman under the rubric "Faces of the </F>
Week": "Portrait of `Repairmen'"] 
  [Text] Well, repair of the government, the need for 
which the ruling majority has been bringing up for so long, is 
for all practical purposes an accomplished fact. An elegant 
touch: The names of the new ministers follow one another in 
strict keeping with the Latin alphabet: J (Jurgenson), K 
(Kannik, Kranich), and L (Luik). 
  TOIVO JURGENSON. A man of pleasant manners, with a 
quiet voice and a shy smile. At 36, he is the oldest of the 
foursome. According to the parliament's deputy speaker, Tunne 
Kelam, he worked extensively and fruitfully in the parliamentary 
commission on the economy. Some of the results have been felt 
quite tangibly by Tallinn residents: It was at his initiative 
that the State Assembly cut to a minimum subsidies for public 
transportation in the capital. In the Isamaa he was considered a 
leading specialist and ideologist on the subject of agriculture. 
In the fall, when angry peasants staged a siege of the 
parliament building, he looked out of the window and said that 
Estonian agriculture was still in the hands of socialist 
structures, which had "lobbied" this action. 
  INDREK KANNIK. Was considered an Isamaa ideologist 
but, in the public eye all the time, has not qualified for the 
fame of a "gray cardinal." Aside from the prime minister, he was 
affected by well-known scandals less any of Isamaa's other top 
people. After the most sensational of them--the "vodka 
scandal"--when the subject of changing of the faction leadership 
came up, he was rumored to be a prime candidate for the 
parliamentary leader of Isamaa. This did not happen, however. 
Perhaps even then he kept in his sights the far-reaching aim of 
a ministerial portfolio. Numerous remarks at parliamentary press 
conferences on issues of the national security concept are 
probably the only link between the name of Kannik, who has never 
served in the military--like his predecessor, as a matter of 
fact--and the job of minister of defense. That, and his obvious 
character trait of decisiveness. 
  HEIKI KRANICH. While being a member of the ruling 
coalition, he was not a member of Isamaa faction of late, 
joining instead the liberals faction that recently split from 
Isamaa. One of the "fathers" of the current tax system. By the 
way, it was he who stubbornly insisted on the need to apply 
turnover tax to periodicals. Unlike the aforementioned, he was 
up to his neck in the "vodka scandal" since, together with Illar 
Hallaste, he was a member of Liviko's administrative council. He 
is still involved in litigation with the RAHVA HAEL newspaper on 
the subject of an item, which, he contends, inflicted moral 
damage on him to the tune of half a million kroons. He seeks to 
exact the half million from the offender in his lawsuit. 
  JURI LUIK. This name is probably more familiar to 
the reader than the rest. Head of the Estonian delegation at the 
negotiations with Russia, he looked almost like a boy, albeit 
bearded, next to the cleanly shaven and experienced Vasiliy 
Svirin. His remarks to journalists after each round of 
negotiations were not always diplomatic, sometimes prompting 
even the usually restrained and polite Svirin to a verbal 
skirmish. As time went by, he became less overtly emotional, and 
learned diplomacy--not just a diplomat's polish but also 
experience--which even his rivals in the negotiations 
acknowledged. His tenure in the job of minister of defense was 
so short-lived, however, that it did not leave any publicly 
visible trail.

Ministry of Finance, and Yaroslav Tolstikov, journalist: 
"Investment in the Economies of Estonia and Russia: What Is 
Behind the Numbers?"] 
  [Text] We continue the publication of a series of 
articles on the comparative economic situation in Estonia and 
Russia prepared by Sergey Trifonov, chief specialist of the 
Ministry of Finance, and Yaroslav Tolstikov, journalist. For the 
previous publications, see the issues of our newspaper for 22 
and 29 December 1993. 
  Investment in the economy of the country, that is, making 
outlays for its development, means laying a foundation for the 
future prosperity of society. The growth of investment means 
drawing closer to a such a future; slowing investment down means 
eating away at our own potential, eating away at our own selves. 
  What is the investment situation in the economy of Estonia 
today? We must note, first, that we lack any kind of clear-cut 
statistical base with regard to all sectors. Why do we lack it? 
It is impossible to gather the necessary data all at once for 
the tens of thousands of enterprises, mostly small and 
medium-size ones, and analyze all of them to see what kinds of 
processes are developing there. However, we can discuss 
estimates. 
  So, the total volume of investment in the economy of Estonia 
in nine months of 1993 came to about 2 billion kroons and, in 
comparable prices, remained at the level of the corresponding 
period of 1992. Under our circumstances, this is a positive 
note. Investment on the whole did not decrease, although it did 
not grow either, while we know how difficult the period is our 
society is now going through. The enterprises themselves have a 
bare minimum of funds for investment, and this is well known. 
  It is no accident that under the circumstances we are 
placing 
our bets on foreign investment, on luring foreign investors to 
Estonia. We clearly lack our own capital. 
  However, in this instance the numbers are quite 
contradictory. There are statistical data, but they take into 
account only foreign investment as of the moment of the 
establishment of a given joint venture or foreign enterprise. 
This is their original contribution, and it is reflected by 
statistics. However, current contributions to already operating 
joint ventures or foreign enterprises, or the same enterprises 
established earlier, do not show up in the statistics. 
  According to statistical data, the following quite 
approximate picture emerges. As of the end of the first quarter 
of 1993, the volume of foreign investment came to just 2.2 
billion kroons, and by the end of the third quarter, had 
increased to 2.5 billion kroons. That is to say, the total 
volume of investment during the year, as has already been noted, 
remained at the same level--2.2 billion kroons during the year, 
but the share of foreign investors increased. How are these 
numbers to be evaluated? 
  There is a council of experts at the Institute for the Study 
of Trends. This council believes that the course of the 
investment process is unsatisfactory; there is little 
investment, more is necessary. 
  However, this is after all a maximalist approach. We wish 
well, but realistic potential must be taken into account, too. 
It is good in and of itself that we are registering a continuous 
growth of foreign investment, although of course more can be 
desired. 
  It is also necessary to note that at present only one-fourth 
of all investment goes to industry, and the rest goes to other 
sectors. In other words, a process of structural changes in the 
economy is underway. Indeed, industry used to be the sector that 
got investment first. Foreign investors now understand that this 
is not the best investment there is, and are investing in the 
service and trade sectors. Therefore, structural changes in the 
economy occur in our country under the influence of foreign 
capital, among other things. 
  Statistical data indicate that during the nine months of 
1993 
foreign investment came to 625 million kroons, of which 208 
million kroons were in the third quarter. In turn, according to 
the balance of payments, that is, data from the Bank of Estonia, 
it turns out that in the nine months of 1993 foreign investment 
came to 1.5 billion kroons. We have already said which data show 
up in the statistics and which do not. The discrepancy results 
precisely from this. Therefore, the data of the Bank of Estonia 
should be considered closer to the truth. 
  Who precisely are the largest foreign investors? They are 
companies from Sweden and Finland. The volume of investment by 
Russia keeps decreasing. In the third quarter of 1993 Russia 
merely ranked seventh, with a volume of investment of 8 million 
kroons. 
  Data on investment in its own economy are published in 
Russia 
accurately, quarter after quarter. Naturally, the high rate of 
inflation hampers foreign investors, and a drop in the volume is 
being registered. Nonetheless, the level of investment remains 
quite high. Thus in the first quarter of 1993 the volume of 
investment came to 97 percent compared to the corresponding 
period of 1992, and in the third quarter--93 percent. 
  The total volume of foreign investment in Russia came to $7 
billion as of the end of the second quarter of 1993. Germany and 
the United States are the main investors. 
  If we compare the per capita volumes of foreign investment 
in 
Russia and in our country (based on statistical data), we will 
obtain $46 for Russia and $115 for Estonia in the first half of 
1993. 
  Here are a few more numbers. In Russia the number of joint 
ventures comes to 7,000, and in Estonia--4,000. These are 
absolute numbers, and they speak volumes. At present Estonia 
amounts to a more attractive bridgehead for foreign investors 
than Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Trifonov, chief specialist of the </F>
Ministry of Finance, and Yaroslav Tolstikov, journalist, under 
the rubric "Prompt Analysis": "Foreign Economic Operations of 
Estonia and Russia: What Is Behind the Numbers?"] 
  [Text] This article completes a series of presentations in 
our newspaper by Sergey Trifonov, chief specialist of the 
Ministry of Finance, and Yaroslav Tolstikov, journalist, on the 
topic of the comparative economic situation in Estonia and 
Russia. For previous articles, see the issues of the newspaper 
ESTONIYA for 22 and 29 December 1993 and 5 January 1994. 
  The status of foreign economic operations of the country may 
also be visualized. The assortment of goods in our stores keeps 
expanding. Everyone can see this; therefore, trade with foreign 
states is growing. Here are the numbers. Based on the results of 
the nine months of 1993, the volume of exports of goods 
from Estonia increased by a factor of 2.2 compared to the 
corresponding period of last year. In the first quarter the 
volume came to 1.9 billion kroons, in the first half of the 
year--4.3 billion kroons, and in the nine months--7.1 billion 
kroons. In other words, each subsequent quarter saw the 
increasing growth of exports. We can safely assume that growth 
also occurred in the fourth quarter. 
  Here are the statistics on imports of goods. The total 
volume of imports increased by a factor of 2.4 during the 
nine months. In the first quarter it came to 1.8 billion kroons, 
in the first half of the year--4.4 billion kroons, and in the 
nine months--7.5 billion kroons. This is to say that Estonia's 
foreign economic operations have been performed in a quite 
dynamic manner, although there are nuances. 
  In the first quarter, Estonia completed its foreign economic 
operations with a positive balance, that is, exports exceeded 
imports, but later the picture began to change. A growing 
surplus of imports of goods over exports was registered. 
(At issue are the numbers furnished by the Department of 
Statistics.) 
  The trend of the growth of imports compared to exports is 
an alarming factor. It is known that the stability of 
national currency largely depends on the ratio of export to 
import volumes. 
  However, we have been rescued by another circumstance. The 
above numbers concern only exports and imports of goods. Based 
on the balance of payments drawn up by the Bank of Estonia, we 
may also arrive at exports and imports of services. In this 
instance, the balance is positive, exports of services 
exceed imports. 
  Thus, we were 0.56 billion kroons in negative territory with 
regard to goods during the nine months. Yet the balance for 
services was positive; it exceeded 1 billion kroons and thus 
more than offset the negative balance for goods. 
  What do exports of services consist of? They 
include transportation services--maritime shipping and seaports, 
as well as the tourist sector--hosting guests from abroad. 
  Therefore, in total, including exports of not only goods but 
also services, the balance is positive for now. However, this is 
perhaps hardly a cause for joy. According to a projection 
by the Economics Institute, the negative balance of exports and 
imports of goods will increase in the two years to come, 
and it is not ruled out that by the end of 1995 this negative 
will not longer be offset by the positive from exports of 
services. This will threaten the stability of the Estonian 
kroon. However, it is possible that this is too pessimistic 
a projection. The correct trend is being projected, but the 
balance may remain positive, after all. 
  Now let us look at the state of affairs in Russia. 
Characteristically, exports there are being augmented 
intensively. During the nine months, exports increased by 10 
percent (primarily oil and gas), whereas imports declined by 53 
percent during the same period of time. The positive 
balance of foreign economic activities came to almost $15 
billion. An intensive process of the accumulation of money 
is underway in Russia. To be sure, it is not always clear where 
this money ends up and who administers it. 
  Currently, Russia ranks second as Estonia's trading 
partner in terms of both imports and exports, next to 
Finland. The volume of trade fluctuated and came to 
approximately 1 billion kroons in the third quarter. Russia 
accounts for 20 percent of all Estonian exports, and 18-19 
percent of Estonian imports. The balance in Estonia's trade with 
Russia is positive, although the surplus of exports is small. 
All of this is statistical data. However, the Bank of Estonia 
has corrections to make in it. 
  Nonferrous metals hold the fifth most significant 
position in exports from Estonia. In the first quarter, the 
volume of exports of these metals came to 102 million kroons, in 
the second quarter--227 million kroons, and in the third 
quarter--170 million kroons. During the same period of time 
Estonia imported such metals worth only a few tens of millions 
of kroons. Where do we get nonferrous metals for exports? 
First, from domestic theft, and second, from smuggling out 
of Russia. Both sides profiteer from this; to be sure, in 
Russia it is primarily individuals rather than the state. 
Indeed, smuggling is bad, but this fact means that the border 
between our countries is sealed poorly on the Russian side. 
  So, this contraband transportation to Estonia is not 
registered, but it shows up in exports, and the Bank of Estonia 
makes the relevant correction toward increasing imports and, 
consequently, worsening the trade balance. 
  Now a few words about the structure of exports. Strange 
as it may seem, in terms of significance, ground transportation 
vehicles rank first, or in simpler terms--passenger cars. 
In the first quarter this position came to 185 million kroons, 
in the second--230 million kroons, and in the third--320 million 
kroons. Estonian companies purchase cars in the West, keep about 
one-third of them, and sell most to the East at a profit. A 
small stream of cars goes to the West from the East (the Zhiguli 
and Moskvich cars). All of this is quite normal, legal business: 
Buy it cheaply, sell it expensively. 
  Exports of timber and products made of it 
rank second. Thus, in the third quarter their volume 
came to 215 million kroons. 
  Milk and dairy products rank third. In 
the third quarter this came to 208 million kroons. 
  Fuel (oil and coal) ranks fourth. In 
the third quarter it was 174 million kroons. This business is 
likewise quite legal. We purchase fuel in Russia and resell it 
in the West at a profit. We must note that Russian companies 
frequently ask us to provide such brokerage. 
  Nonferrous metals rank fifth, which has already 
been mentioned. 
  We should note in particular that Estonian milk and dairy 
products have come to rank third in exports. This is a good 
sign. The growth of ferrous metal exports from the East to the 
West is a new aspect. In this instance, Estonia also skillfully 
plays the role of agent. Besides, we have begun to trade in 
sugar going from the West to the East. In both cases these are 
quite legitimate transactions. 
  Now, a few words about imports. 
  The already mentioned cars rank first (430 million 
kroons in the third quarter). 
  Oil and refinery products and coal rank second 
(380 million kroons in the third quarter). 
  Equipment ranks third. The volume of these 
deliveries keeps growing (313 million kroons in the third 
quarter). 
  In summation, we shall say that the foreign economic 
operations of Estonia have developed very dynamically. Second, 
imports of goods exceed exports, and this is bad. Most 
importantly, Estonia is becoming a bridge in trade between the 
East and the West, and an important junction in exchanging goods 
and services. This is gratifying.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Structure of the Estonian </F>
Economy Must Change"] 
  [Text] Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar believes 
that vast changes must occur in the structure of the Estonian 
economy. 
  At present, agricultural production and the food industry 
account for 33.6 percent of the total structure of production. 
This ratio is not favorable; the proportion of industry should 
be substantially higher. 
  Throughout the world agriculture is subsidized at the 
expense 
of other sectors of production, whereas in Estonia this cannot 
be done. Leetsar believes that in the future agriculture should 
not remain a leader in the area of exports. The volume of 
production in agriculture should increase; however, the growth 
in industry should be substantially higher. 
  Last year exports of agricultural products increased by 
approximately a factor of two, and came to 2.1 billion kroons, 
leaving other sectors of industry behind.

<F P=106> [ETA report: "Almost 80,000 Agricultural Workers Lost Their </F>
Jobs"] 
  [Text] As a result of the property reform in 
agriculture, by the end of 1992, 37,000 persons had lost their 
previous place of employment in Estonia; in 1993 this number 
increased by another 37,000, Minister of Agriculture Jaan 
Leetsar reported at a press conference on Monday. 
  "These people have been laid off their former jobs and get 
by 
on occasional jobs, as farm laborers, timber loggers, or 
gathering wild berries," added the minister. Several years ago 
Estonia had 360 large farms, which as a result of the property 
reform have been reorganized into almost 7,000 new agricultural 
production units, among which are 4,300 family farms, more than 
1,200 joint-stock companies, more than 500 shareholding 
partnerships, and others. 
  "The Ministry of Agriculture does not yet have figures on 
how 
many rural residents have income as proprietors and how many are 
living by selling their labor," stated Leetsar. Computers 
purchased by the ministry with the aid of Italy will enable it 
to establish computer links with districts and give the ministry 
a sufficiently clear picture of the processes taking place in 
the countryside, said the minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Olav Kruus: "Minister of Agriculture Jaan </F>
Leetsaar: Industry To Support Agriculture, Rural Reforms To Be 
Stepped Up"] 
  [Text] 
  Agricultural production makes up 33.6 percent of the 
domestic gross product and that puts agriculture clearly in the 
first place in our economy, Jaan Leetsaar, minister of 
agriculture, said at the ministry's press conference. "However, 
such an economic indicator is not normal in a state where only a 
million hectares of land are used for agricultural production. 
Changes in the economic structure must take place in the near 
future, because an economic sector with such a small work force 
and meager monetary resources cannot maintain its leading 
position for long," the minister noted. 
  Leetsaar explained that, in other European countries, 
subsidies to agriculture are made from taxes proceeds on 
industrial profits, and same could be done in Estonia but, 
unfortunately, right now we do not have economic sectors strong 
enough to support agriculture. 
<H5>  Ownership Reform Has Been Carried Out </H5>
  Leetsaar said that reorganization of state farms and 
collectives has been completed successfully. As a result of 
ownership reform, 360 large collectives have been replaced by 
7,000 new agricultural production units. As of last October, 
there are more than 4,300 farms, roughly 1,200 joint stock 
companies, close to 800 associations, and 500 cooperatives in 
Estonia, Leetsaar said. 
  Negative results of ownership reform, according to Leetsaar, 
include unemployment for 75,000 rural residents. In 1992, 37,000 
persons were left unemployed, followed by roughly the same 
number in 1993. A portion of these people make a living off odd 
jobs. There are people in rural areas, who draw an income from 
business ownership and work for wages at the same time. The 
ministry has no overview of how the different ways of making a 
living are distributed in the country, the minister admitted. He 
said that business ventures should be encouraged in rural areas 
to make full use of the under-employed. 
  Employment problems are indeed of primary concern to the 
ministry for the year now starting, Leetsaar remarked. He added 
though that it is the rural residents themselves who are 
reluctant to try out new formats of entrepreneurship. 
<H5>  Land Reform Is Snagged </H5>
  The minister admitted that land reform is stuck pretty much 
at where it was a year ago. Among the main reasons holding up 
reform, the minister cited the lack of laws on land regulation 
and assessment, and the lack of a system for land replacement. 
Developing a system for land regulation and assessment has been 
snagged because of poor performance on the part of the Land 
Office. 
  Leetsar said that his ministry cannot speed up the process 
because Land Office now reports to the environmental ministry, 
instead of the agriculture ministry. 
<H5>  Unfair Competition </H5>
  Unfair competition, the minister claims, comes from the 
unrestricted import of heavily subsidized products to Estonia. 
To stop that, an anti-dumping bill has been submitted to 
Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament]. A bill on assessing customs 
has also been held up in the finance ministry for some time now, 
Leetsaar said. That, too, should be submitted to Riigikogu, and 
implemented as soon as possible, because food items are often 
brought into Estonia that are declared in customs at below 
producers' prices. At the same time, customs statistics do not 
reflect the actual imports of food items, Leetsaar said. 
  For the year now starting, the ministry is planning to pay 
more attention to the regional politics of rural life, speeding 
up agricultural reform and `privatizing economic activity' the 
minister said. He emphasized the last phrase saying that, in the 
country, one can often find enterprises whose assets and 
production facilities cannot match the economic significance of 
well-developed production and trade relations. 
<H3>  Prime Minister Is Sticking to Agreement Made With 
Agricultural Producers </H3>
  The agreement on the pricing of agricultural products that 
was reached between the government and representatives of 
agricultural producers is still waiting, ever since last 
September, to be put on the agenda of a government session by 
the prime minister, Jaan Leetsaar said. 
  The signed agreement resulting from negotiations based on 
the 
income law was concluded at the end of September last year. 
Representing the government at these negotiations were the 
ministries of economics, agriculture and finance, and the head 
and signator of the government delegation was Margus Leivo, 
chancellor of the economics ministry. He also promptly submitted 
the agreement to the prime minister, requesting that it be 
discussed at a session of the government, Leetsaar said. 
  According to that agreement, it would take grants and 
credits 
for up to 748 million kroons just to maintain domestic 
agricultural production at its present level. At that time, more 
than 200 million kroons had been allocated to agriculture in the 
1994 budget bill. To come up with the rest of the money, the 
ministry had promised to start negotiations and take the matter 
up at a government session. 
  "Chancellor Leivo submitted the agreement to the head of 
government at the end of September but, unfortunately, it has 
gotten stuck in one of Laar's drawers," minister Leetsaar said. 
  He added that, by now, these estimated amounts have changed, 
and the ministry is kept busy with calculating actual prices for 
agricultural products. Calculations show that price increases 
are likely for milk and dairy products in the near future. 
Current production expenses, the minister said, exceed even the 
production costs specified in the agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Vaino Sarnet, Executive Director of </F>
Privatization Agency: "Getting Rid of Toothache (lack of 
economic viability in a state enterprise), Calls for a Dental 
Drill (privatization)"] 
  [Text] 
  Vaino Sarnet, executive director of the 
Privatization Agency has been on the job for four months now. In 
the accompanying letter he wrote: "My views on privatization, 
however, go back much longer than that, to the time when I was 
assistant district elder for Western Virumaa and chairman of the 
district's commission on returning illegally expropriated 
property." Have they remained the same or have they changed, the 
author asks. 
  Vaino Sarnet's position is that privatization 
should be accelerated and decentralized. 
<H5>  We Are Still a Long Way From Where We Expected To Be </H5>
  On the positive side one could mention an increase 
in the rate of sales at the end of last year, a decrease in the 
portion of selling off parts of enterprises, and an increase in 
the portion of selling shares. 
  Averting, or at least postponing, the many potential 
privatization scandals is a positive factor in itself, so that 
one could go on working instead of concentrating on scandal 
control. We have faced court debates ever more assertively, 
creating precedents so that the privatization process could not 
be slowed down or stopped on some flimsy pretext. 
  There are enough people around who wish that privatization 
be 
curbed or brought to a stop. The simplest way to do that would 
be to emphasize the confusion and the setbacks that inevitably 
go along with any changes in ownership formats. 
<H5>  Myths About Privatization </H5>
  A privatization notice brings out the Doomsday sayers 
at an enterprise. This is partially true, but only in cases 
of inefficient management and production. The buyer wants to get 
the enterprise operating efficiently, involving all of its good 
employees and specialists. 
  State-owned enterprises are sold to foreigners for 
next-to-nothing. Foreigners would have to buy an enterprise 
in a round of competitive bidding, where Estonian capital would 
have an advantage (a 10-year schedule of payments). It is 
important to have as many foreign investors among the bidders as 
possible. This increases the chances of finding a buyer who has 
the skills, the knowledge and the money to make a go of it on 
the world market. 
  Privatization is happening too soon, Estonia's capital 
is not yet strong enough. The strength of Estonia's capital 
comes from lower wages and more difficult working conditions, 
compared to those of foreign companies. It is not something that 
most people cherish. Russian capital, for one, has been very 
eager to supplement, and to dilute, our capital. The only way to 
minimize that is to attract Western investors. 
  In the course of privatization, someone's interests and 
rights are always being stepped on. Partially, this is 
true, of course. Sudden changes will always violate someone's 
rights but, due to the significance of the process, one must 
proceed without slowing down. These problems, too, will have to 
be solved either on the run, or put off until such damages can 
be assessed, and the state in a position to compensate for them 
out of the earnings stemming from privatization. 
<H5>  Why Is Rapid Privatization an Economic Necessity? </H5>
  Privatization is necesary because: 
  1) Even in principle, the state cannot properly handle the 
business side of an enterprise, not to mention a weak state 
like Estonia; 
  2) The state cannot vouch for the preservation of assets, 
not 
to mention for increasing them; 
  3) The national treasury does not collect enough taxes from 
state enterprises. State enterprises are being subsidized 
from tax liabilities, putting private enterprises at a 
disadvantage; 
  4) Due to lack of supervision, economic crimes are being 
committed; 
  5) Due to lack of supervision, privatization through 
unauthorized acquisitions of property can be attempted with 
the help of the bankruptcy law and bond agreements; 
  6) There is a reluctance to invest in state enterprises and, 
if and when it happens, it is done at a considerable 
disadvantage to that state enterprise; 
  7) State enterprises are many, and that makes it impossible 
for the state and the ministries to deal with the tasks that 
shape the economy of the state (economic policy, tax policy, 
financial policy). Instead, a half-hearted effort is usually 
made to assume the role of the owner. It is difficult, however, 
to maintain both roles, that of being the owner and that of 
prescribing norms to regulate itself. 
<H5>  A Dental Drill Can Scare Off Anyone </H5>
  To the Estonian media, and through it also to the general 
public, privatization has so far been like a dental drill that 
will scare off anyone. Just the sight of a drill can make you 
forget the pain that brought you to the dentist's office. One 
also gets used to the pain. This is why it is important that 
someone assume the thankless task of explaining that toothache 
(lack of economic viability in a state enterprise) can only be 
cured by using the dental drill (privatization). 
  Inevitably, the privatization agency must assume a bigger 
role, here. Without the support of public opinion, however, 
privatization could be severely hampered. 
  Not enough writing is done on topics such as the unfounded 
economic deterioration of state-owned enterprises, the unabashed 
transfer of assets from state enterprises into corporations 
closely linked to its employees, managements' helpful hand in 
the bankruptcies of many state enterprises, unprofitable and/or 
illegal sales or rentals of state enterprise assets, shutting 
off heat to housing units of state enterprises, closing of 
nursery schools, use of municipal assets, and tax liabilities of 
state enterprises. 
<H5>  How To Speed Up Privatization? </H5>
  To speed up the rate of privatization, we are planning to: 
  * continue having international bidding competitions; 
  * start privatization proceedings with a public sale of the 
corporation's shares for money or for privatization securities; 
  * decentralize preparations for privatization (involving 
ministries, district governments, and private companies). To 
widen the scope of decentralization, prior permission should be 
obtained from the government of the republic to make payments 
for privatization activity contingent on the outcome. 
Additional opportunities should be found, even through foreign 
aid programs; 
  * start preparations for the sale of more complex objects 
with the help of foreign experts, and make maximum use of 
opportunities presented by foreign aid programs; 
  * speed up preparations for the sales by extending 
cooperation with banks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janis Lagzdins, chairman of the Saeima </F>
Commission for State Government and Self-Government Affairs, by 
an unidentified interviewer; place and date not given: "What 
Will Our Self-Government Be? Janis Lagzdins, Chairman of the 
Saeima Commission for State Government and Self-Government 
Affairs, Comments on the Law `On Elections of City Dumas, Rayon 
Councils, and Volost Councils'"] 
  [Text] 
  [DIYENA] First, tell us please how this self-government 
election will be different from the previous one. 
  [Lagzdins] Numerically, the membership of dumas and councils 
elected during this election will be much smaller than before. 
In previous elections of councils, between 50 and 120 deputies 
were elected to the councils in large cities (for example, there 
were 117 deputies in Liepaja), whereas now their number will be 
up to 15, and in Riga--60. As a rule, rural councils will have 
seven to nine members. 
  Previously, elections were held on the basis of a majority 
electoral system. In each city, rayon, or volost, there were 
several electoral districts within which a few candidates for 
deputy competed. One deputy was elected from each district. In 
turn, the election expected to be held on 22 May will be 
proportional, whereby each administrative-territorial unit will 
form a single electoral district. The difference also is in the 
fact that a citizen of the Republic of Latvia may be a candidate 
for duma or council deputy, and only the citizens of the 
Republic of Latvia will be able to take part in the election. 
All residents of Latvia could take part in previous elections. 
  The requirements for candidates for deputy are much 
stricter. 
For example, Article 8 envisions that a candidate for deputy 
must have had a residence permit in the self-governing 
administrative territory of the respective for at least 12 
months prior to the election day. Article 9 establishes that 
individuals serving sentences in incarceration facilities, 
individuals who have been found to be legally incompetent 
through procedures established by law, individuals who have 
convictions for premeditated grave crimes, and individuals who 
have served in the USSR or Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic KGB 
[Committee for State Security] or other similar organs 
enumerated in subpoint 4, Article 9, cannot be candidate for 
deputy. The requirement to be fluent in the state language at 
the level of the third (highest) category is significant. 
  Previously, there were no restrictions covering deputies, 
members of the government, procurators, judges, and career 
servicemen (Article 10). Such restrictions have been introduced 
so that these popular individuals will not be used in the 
interest of various political groups. How could this be done? 
These people who are popular in society may consent to run in an 
election, thus boosting the popularity of their political group. 
Once they "drag in" a second echelon of candidates for deputies 
into dumas or councils in this manner, they may give up the 
deputy credentials received, and continue to discharge their 
previous responsibilities. For this reason, Article 10 provides 
that in the event of their election, they lose either the 
credentials of Saeima deputies or the positions they hold. 
  Ballots are an interesting nuance of these elections. 
Article 
29 envisions that a space for voter marks will be available on 
the ballot opposite the name of each list of candidates and the 
last name of each candidate. The voter will have two 
possibilities or alternatives. 
  If he wishes to vote for one list of candidates in its 
entirety, he will place the "+" sign next to the name of the 
relevant list of candidates. This means that the voter supports 
the election of all candidates for deputy appearing on this list. 
  If the voter decides to vote for candidates included on 
various lists of candidates, he will place the relevant "+" sign 
next to the last names of the candidates for whom he has decided 
to vote. However, the voter should remember that the number of 
"+" signs placed in this manner should not exceed the number of 
deputy seats in the duma or council in question. 
  The voter can select only one of these two variants--either 
vote for a list of candidates as a whole (Variant 1) or vote for 
individual candidates for deputy separately (Variant 2). I would 
like to bring to your attention Article 46, which grants the 
filers of candidate lists the right to lodge a complaint with a 
court about the conduct of the election within seven days after 
the decree of the electoral commission is passed. If the court 
rules that violations were allowed to occur in the course of the 
election which influenced the distribution of the seats of duma 
or council deputies among political organizations or their 
associations, or the associations of voters, the Central 
Electoral Commission will declare repeat elections through 
procedures established in the law. 
  Previously, in self-government elections there was no ban 
either on financing the election campaigns of various political 
organizations and associations out of state funds. It is also 
forbidden to finance election campaigns out of anonymous 
donations. Article 51 envisions arrangements for monitoring 
execution. 
  This self-government election will still be financed out of 
state funds, namely: The state will pay for the manufacturing of 
ballots, the publication of candidate lists in the press, and 
the work of the members of electoral commissions. 
  In the future, self-government elections will be paid for 
from self-government budgets. 
  These are the main differences between the new law and the 
law on elections to old self-government bodies or councils. 
  The election will last one day. Servicemen will be able to 
vote for three days before the established date of the general 
election. As usual, one will have to carry a passport of the 
citizen of the Republic of Latvia, or the so-called old passport 
with an entry concerning the citizenship of the Republic of 
Latvia. All citizens of the Republic of Latvia who have reached 
the age of 18 by election day take part in the elections, unless 
restrictions established by Article 6 apply to them. 
  [DIYENA] Tell us, please, in what cases elections may be 
considered to have been held? 
  [Lagzdins] An election will have been held if even one voter 
participates in it. This single voter votes for a list of 
candidates for deputy, and all of these candidates become 
members of the duma or authority. This condition influences the 
activity of all other citizens and their responsibility for the 
future development of their administrative rayon, so that one 
voter will not decide the fate of the composition of the duma or 
council. Western experience shows that a sufficiently large 
number of citizens always participate in elections. 
  [DIYENA] Article 15 ordains that the number of candidates 
included on a list may not exceed the number of deputies elected 
to a duma (council). Does this not restrict my right, the 
voter's right to choose? 
  [Lagzdins] By no means. This is the number of candidates on 
just one list. However, several lists are provided, and you may 
vote either for individual candidates or for one of the lists of 
candidates as a whole. 
  If only one list exists in a specific electoral district, 
then there is indeed no choice. However, who should be blamed 
for this? The political passivity of the residents themselves is 
to blame in this instance. Since it is possible to form several 
lists, this opportunity is, as a rule, taken advantage of. 
  [DIYENA] Only citizens elect, and only citizens can get 
elected. Could a situation emerge in a rayon or volost in which 
elections will be a formality because of a small number of 
citizens? 
  [Lagzdins] There is not a city in Latvia, not a rayon, and 
not a volost, with the exception of Sedskaya Volost (15 
percent), in which the number of citizens does not exceed 50 
percent. For example, in Daugavpils, 62 percent of the residents 
are citizens, in Riga--54 percent, and in Liepaja--50 percent. 
In Latgale, this is no problem. This problem does not exist in 
Latvia at all. 
  [DIYENA] Point 4, Article 9 of the law specifies that 
individuals who have operated within the structures of the USSR 
or Latvian SSR KGB or the intelligence service, and former 
undercover operatives or keepers of the safe houses of these 
establishments, may not be nominated as candidates in elections 
to dumas or councils. How will the electoral commissions be able 
to ensure compliance with this article of the law? 
  [Lagzdins] Unlike the law on elections to the Saeima, the 
law 
in question already envisions a certain control mechanism. 
First, there is Article 17, which provides that all candidates 
for deputy fill out and sign declarations of compliance with 
point 4, Article 9. Otherwise, the deputy credentials shall be 
annulled, and the deputy himself shall be held accountable under 
Article 151-3 of the Criminal Code, which envisions 
incarceration for a period of up to three years. If a member of 
the government, a deputy, or another executive official has 
provided false information, he will be threatened with 
incarceration for a period of two to five years. 
  Article 20 of the law specifies that, within the limits of 
their opportunities, electoral commissions shall verify 
compliance with the requirements of Articles 8 and 9. 
  Besides, let us hope that political organizations will 
intensively monitor one another in the course of the election 
struggle. 
  Our commission intends to approach relevant institutions 
involved in the investigation of the crimes of the totalitarian 
regime with a request to publish in the official newspaper of 
the country a staff list of the employees of the former KGB, so 
that these people will be known and will not be able to be 
nominated as candidates for deputy in a self-government 
election. However, a special decree of the Saeima is necessary 
for this measure to be taken. Besides, it should be passed 
before the nomination of candidates for deputy. 
  [DIYENA] Are there plans to pass any more laws associated 
with self-government elections before the beginning of the 
election campaign? 
  [Lagzdins] The notion of "voter association" was not defined 
in the course of the previous Saeima election. Article 15 now 
states that such associations are formed by individuals who have 
signed lists of candidates plus individuals announced on 
candidate lists. Consequently, voter associations in volosts 
will not be numerically smaller than 20 people, in large 
cities--about 50 people, and in Riga--about 110 people. We are 
planning to endow these voter associations with greater rights 
in the future. At present, I am developing a draft law that 
calls for granting individuals who sign lists of candidates for 
deputy the right to propose a recall of so-called undisciplined 
deputies. For example, a deputy elected to a duma or council 
decides to switch from his faction to another faction. What is 
to be done about him? To date, there has not been a law that 
granted us the right to recall this deputy. The developed draft 
provides that two-thirds of the persons who have signed the 
candidate list are entitled to approach the relevant city, 
rayon, or volost electoral commission with a proposal to recall 
the deputy in question. The electoral commission will consider 
the petition, verify documentation associated with the election, 
and put the issue of recall to a vote within one month through 
procedures envisaged in the law. If no fewer than one-half of 
the voters who previously voted for the list in question in the 
electoral district in question vote in favor of the recall, the 
deputy will be considered recalled. 
  This draft should also become law before the beginning of 
the 
election campaign.

<F P=106> [Article by Valdis Zakis under the rubric "Problem": </F>
"Weapons with a Latvian Trademark. Is It Reality?"] 
  [Text] The defense and security of the country has been 
defined by the government of Latvia as one of the priorities of 
state policy. In any case the incident with the arrest of the 
Russian generals, which threatened to develop into an interstate 
armed conflict, aggravated this problem. This was reflected in 
the draft state budget for 1994 in which additional capital was 
appropriated for defense needs. 
  This money was also supposed to be used to buy weapons. 
DIYENA has information that the representatives of the 
appropriate military structures are holding such negotiations 
with weapons dealers of Israel and the Czech Republic. However, 
the production of weapons, including automatic combat weapons, 
can be set up in our country in a month, but it has become clear 
that such an expert evaluation and the basic financial 
calculation have not been made in the highest echelons of power. 
  The situation is complicated by the fact that as yet there 
is 
no definite plan for arming the military structures in the 
state, although they are receiving weapons. Plans to buy weapons 
abroad apparently arose from the lack of knowledge on our own 
potential or from the incompetence of certain state officials. 
Buying weapons abroad is not simply more expensive, it is much 
more expensive. And it is not only the automatic rifles and 
pistols themselves but the high price of the ammunition for them. 
  There is no sense in proposing Russian weapons to state 
structures now; that requires preliminary negotiations, the 
consent of Russia's government (which is very problematical), 
and so forth. 
  In Russia the price of an AK-74 automatic rifle fluctuates 
from 220 to 190 dollars. While the firm EFA is already operating 
on the Latvian market on a legal basis with a license from the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Latvia (the only 
one so far) and can supply essentially the same rifle (5.45, 
5.56, or 5.65 caliber, for NATO ammunition) at 140 dollars 
apiece. 
  The same can be said for pistols. Even now hunting guns such 
as the Sayga and Tigr carbines are offered to wholesale clients 
at prices lower than Russian ones. 
  According to preliminary evaluations, it is more prestigious 
and profitable to reorient this firm to producing domestic 
weapons stamped "Made in Latvia." 
  It is no problem for the firm to launch production in 
cooperation with Russian weapons makers. Especially since around 
40 percent of the components can be produced locally. The EFA 
firm, according to official information, is already the owner of 
a packet of documents on several types of weapons. So creating a 
Latvian military-industrial complex is completely realistic, 
given the good will of the government and the Sejm. 
  As for the quality of future output, the world renown of the 
Russian weapon can serve as its guarantee. For the fact is well 
known that an absolute majority of special units of the armies 
of NATO member countries were indeed armed with the Russian 
weapon. 
  As for the need to create our own military-industrial 
complex, there can be no two opinions about it--the export of 
weapons has always been a profitable state business. 
  In an interview on this topic, the responsible leaders of 
the 
military structures evaluated the situation which has taken 
shape in contradictory ways. 
  The deputy commander of the Defense Forces of Latvia, 
Yevgeniy Bogdan, on the one hand, is certain that the important 
thing is to obtain a state order for arming the Latvian army, 
but such an order cannot be placed with EFA, in particular, 
since there is no money. It is a vicious circle. 
  The minister of internal affairs, Girt Kristovskis, does not 
reject the possibility of placing a state order. Moreover, he 
assures us that if a private firm's weapon is competitive, 
including the price range, weapons for the Defense Forces and 
the police could be entrusted to it. But even so, from the 
state's standpoint, the minister does not see any savings here. 
  So just who is ultimately able to provide an expert analysis 
of what is beneficial for the state? Should we obtain those 
weapons needed to arm the army and the police at a higher price 
abroad or from Latvian producers--at a lower one? Should we buy 
them, spending millions of dollars, or receive these same 
millions by selling them?

<F P=106> [Article by Agita Berzinya: "UN Specialists on the Fight </F>
Against Narcotics Will Work in Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 30 January. The UN program mission on 
narcotics control arrived in Riga today. Its visit is tied to 
the creation in Riga of the Baltic Regional Bureau on Narcotics 
Control. Thus Latvia becomes the Baltic Region center in the 
struggle against narcotics. It is proposed that during the visit 
the mission's representatives will meet with members of the 
government and visit the Rindzelskiy Hospital in Tukumskiy 
Rayon, where a regional institution for treating drug addicts 
partly financed by the UN is to be created. The mission's 
specialists will also visit Kleysty, where they will visit a 
breeding kennel where dogs are taught to search for narcotics. 
So far in Latvia only two dogs have been taught to do this. 
  The realization of the UN draft program on narcotics control 
in the Baltic countries has already begun, reported the chief 
narcotics expert of the department of health, Janis Strazdins. 
The 1.3 million U.S. dollars allocated for this will make it 
possible to strengthen customs, the police, and the border 
troops and train associates of toxicology laboratories. 
  In early January the coordinator of the UN program on 
narcotics control and the mission's leader in the Baltic 
countries, John Header, gave the National Coordinating 
Commission and Committee on Narcotics Control, the criminal 
science center, the police department, the border brigade, and 
the customs service of the Republic of Latvia 70 portable units 
to detect narcotic substances. They can be used to detect any 
narcotic substance. They will help laboratories technically 
provide narcotics control. 
  The mission will be in Latvia until 3 February, and then it 
will leave for Lithuania.

<F P=106> [Interview of Colonel Dainis Turlais, Defense Forces </F>
Commander, by Guntis Stamers: "A Running Officer Provokes 
Laughter in Peacetime"] 
  [Text] 
  [Stamers] Speaking at the Foreign Policy Institute of Latvia 
you said that potential threats to our country are currently 
greater than the capablity to meet them. The Cabinet of 
Ministers at the last moment changed the draft budget, proposing 
an increase in resources for the defense forces. Please specify 
what steps are anticipated to improve the condition of the 
defense forces. 
  [Turlais] Unfortunately I cannot say anything, because 
Latvia 
is ruled by a unique situation: the commander of the army does 
not participate either in assesssing the needs of the defense 
forces, nor in dviding up the budget, that is, deciding who 
needs the most. In truth the government disinforms the 
taxpayers: The sum alloted for defense also includes financing 
for various state institutions unrelated to defense. People 
conclude that the army is alloted large sums of money, but I 
cannot tell exactly how much. No one has provided an overview of 
how much has gone to the army in the previous two years, nor do 
I know how much there will be. 
  It seems to me that the main problem is that the Finance 
Ministry has a rather murky idea of what the defense budget 
should look like, what it should include, and what its 
organizational structure is. The Finance Ministry ought to have 
a department, or at least a section, which works with the 
military budget. There is no way that a "Soviet" accountant can 
develop a state defense budget! 
  The second problem is that the defense budget, by virtue of 
its very size, becomes political; ideology, rather than 
practical needs, becomes the determining factor. 
  [Stamers] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Saeima 
Foreign Affairs Commission, has expressed the opinion that as 
Latvia's first priority it is essential to secure real control 
over our territory, and he has suggested that defense be offered 
the means to obtain an anti-aircraft defense system: 
ground-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons. Do you believe 
that that is a priority? 
  [Turlais] Yes. We have discussed these questions with Mr. 
Kirsteins. You must understand that a country's borders include 
not only the dry land and the sea, but also air space is 
included in a coutry's territory. That does not mean that we 
must shoot everything down to the ground, but we must know, must 
control who finds their way into this airspace--with or without 
our permission--and we must implement also security operations. 
In turn, about land forces armaments, if there are no anti-tank 
devices, we cannot talk seriously about our defense forces, the 
Home Guard. We will not challenge tanks with clubs, sticks and 
Molotov cocktails alone. 
  [Stamers] Estonia has decided to buy weapons, this same 
kind, 
from Israel. When Latvia decides, will it also be Israel? 
  [Turlais] That's not of primary importance. The question is 
a 
different one: "Why is Latvia do nothing?" We both started at 
the same time, but now the Estonians have both anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft systems and armored transport. The Estonian army 
has the technology; they have mobilized battalions that are able 
to function. The Lithuanians are also armed; they have ships, 
airplanes with missiles. They are capable of doing something. 
Why are we implementing almost nothing? Why have there been no 
final decisions on my initiatives to manufacture cartridges, to 
purchase weapons? 
  [Stamers] Do you no the answer to this question? 
  [Turlais] I think that everyone knows how many shrill 
politicians we have who are able to philosophize and talk about 
anything, but really do nothing, only create a situation in 
which the government does not take practical steps. That is to 
an extent the weakness of the government, that everything is 
done looking backwards: What will be the reaction? Who will 
criticize us? But the country's security interests cannot be 
based only on popularity. The election campaign must be 
forgotten. We must remember that now there is a government and 
it must take responsibilty. It can only be taken by doing. To do 
nothing would be irresponsible. 
  [Stamers] In your opinion are the chief culprits the 
indecisive ministers who prepare the budget? 
  [Turlais] Without a doubt! No one else has state authority 
to 
supply the army, to purchase weapons. We could go down a 
different path, trying to reach an agreement with "Pardaugava," 
to find out if that concern needs an army. If the government 
decides to attach the army to some firm, then this firm could be 
given the authority to buy weapons, to supply the army. Only one 
must ask whether the army would defend the state's interests in 
such a case? 
  [Stamers] Let's discuss the defense forces themselves. 
Everybody remembers that there was a review carried out to 
clarify their readiness for battle. What has been done since 
that time to decrease the length of time necessary for the army 
to be ready for battle after a declaration of emergency or war? 
  [Turlais] I do not know who decided that the length of time 
was too long and who wants to set the criteria. To review battle 
readiness one must know at least the basics of what that means. 
If battle readiness is evaluated based on how quickly and and in 
what direction a soldier runs when someone whistles, then the 
saying comes to mind: "A running officer in peacetime provokes 
laughter, but in wartime he provokes panic." 
  [Stamers] So then, what are the criteria for battle 
readiness? 
  [Turlais] First of all, the extent to which the army's 
material-technical needs are ensured, to execute its 
assignments. Secondly, the human factor, or how high is the 
level of training for any soldier, from army commander to 
infantryman; how well do they understand their assignments, how 
prepared are they to carry them out. Thirdly, the effectiveness 
of the leadership system. There three factors also establish 
battle readiness. If one of them is zero or at only a low level, 
then the level of battle readiness, regardless of how high the 
other indicators are, will not exceed the level of the lowest 
factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, then the rest of 
the conditions for battle readiness will not save them. And 
similarly, if there is no leadership, then an armed army also 
cannot do anything. 
  To perceive battle readiness in such an illiterate way as 
was 
done is shameful and unseemly. It does not reflect on the level 
of the army, but rather on the level of the Saeima commission, 
to examine in such a way and not to draw any conclusions 
regarding what the legislators must do to change the situation. 
  [Stamers] Do you assert that neither the Saeima, nor the 
government is taking into account that battle readiness must be 
resolved with a complex approach? 
  [Turlais] I think that they are practically not working in 
that way. 
  [Stamers] A question related to the 10 Jaunuary [1994] 
incident. The proposed national security policy, which was 
developed by the defense ministry, stated that one possible 
security threat to Latvia is the conflicting lines of authority 
of the Latvian armed services. As was exemplified by the 
aforementioned incident, the fact that the municipal police were 
given an order by a municipal leader could have led to a 
military conflict. What would you suggest and what is being done 
to change the situation? 
  [Turlais] Currently, according to U.N. data, it seems that 
there are 186 countries in the world and Latvia, I think, is the 
only country in which the armed forces are not led by the 
defense ministry, the government. There are no alternative 
solutions: All armed forces must be under the control of the 
defense ministry. Then at least there will be a specific 
responsible official. If a conflict arises, then the defense 
minister alone will be able to resolve the problem, that would 
be his responsibility. But right now, for example, to 
disentangle a conflict, first, one must find the Home Guard, 
persuade their chief that they have not acted properly and then 
the chief tries to recall or influence the Home Guards. Or also 
one must seek out the municipal police chief and try to persuade 
him that the municipality alone does not make policy, but that 
the government, too, has a word. After that there appears a 
third power: the municipality chairman, who has established his 
own guards and armed them himself. 
  [Stamers] But in accordance with the Constitution the 
President is formally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. 
  [Turlais] It is up to him, no doubt, to achieve that in 
reality, as well as formally. 
  [Stamers] Your ministry is developing the state defense 
policy. When will deputies and the press be able to see it? 
  [Turlais] The mass media also does everything possible to 
disinform people and to preclude that to which we aspire. We 
have rejected the former Soviet armed forces and security model. 
We have turned toward Western Europe, to the democratic states 
model, but our consciousness is still hobbling along on both 
legs; we think like Communists. You, speaking to me as the 
commander of the army, are always asking me, "What is the 
defense ministry doing?" I do not know! The defense ministry is 
a government institution, which is above the defense forces as 
civilian political control. It is concerned with planning 
defense policy, with planning and implementing budgets, with 
control of the army. The army is not a component part of the 
ministry. It is time to forget the Soviet model! We have only 
the Home Guard under the "Marshall principle," in which there is 
nothing above the "Marshall." That is not right. Above all 
military forces must be civilian political control. The armed 
forces themselves may not establish policy, influence goverment 
decrees and dictate conditions. 
  [Stamers] Good. I will give the previous question to 
Minister 
Pavlovskis. 
  [Turlais] Of course, defense policy interests me, too. And 
as 
a professional I want to say that it should not be exaggerated 
with an ominous analysis. I say, if we do not have that, then we 
can do almost nothing. In the world everything changes; both our 
domestic and our foreign policies are dynamic. What would happen 
to ominous analyses? In the time it takes to draft them, print 
them, while it goes through the bureaucratic apparatus and comes 
to examination to adopt it a month has gone by and the situation 
is completely different. In place of that we must try to look at 
the future strategically. 
  There must be people responsible for the country's security: 
the Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Saeima, which must pass 
laws so that the government, the Prime Minister and the armed 
forces can operate. But it cannot be that each deputy dictates 
to me to do what he views as the best. Deputies have the right 
to use their votes to develop laws, but not to dictate a stance 
or their fancies. I would like to find another among the 186 
countries in which a deputy arrived at headquarters and sounded 
an alarm.

<F P=106> [Article by Lisbet Lambert and Lars Halskov Ritzau: "The </F>
Move to Riga"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, three Danish firms acquired 56 
percent of the shares in the Latvian firm of Saiva, Inc., in 
Sloka south of Riga. And at machines from the Danish clothing 
manufacturing firm of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg, 80 Latvian 
seamstresses now work for a monthly wage that no Danish 
seamstress can compete with. 
  There are Danish machines, chairs, and lamps set up in the 
room. And it is work clothing for Danish workers at Danish 
companies that is being manufactured in the sewing room. 
  But it is the pale Latvian winter sun shining in through the 
big window panes. And 26-year-old Laila Serritslev, who monitors 
the quality of the ready-made clothing, does not get far if she 
tries to speak Danish to the seamstresses seated at the machines. 
  The conversation, though, proceeds briskly in the sewing 
room. But it is Latvian and Russian chatter flying across the 
room. 
  The seamstresses' flower-patterned smocks stand in sharp 
contrast to the bundles of white fabric that, stitch by stitch 
and machine by machine, end up as finished smocks for Danish 
hospitals. 
  The machines come from the Danish clothing manufacturing 
firm 
of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg. It took just one weekend to 
move them to the Latvian town of Sloka, 25 km south of Riga. 
  Friday, 2 July 1993 was the last day of work for 44 Danish 
seamstresses at the plant in Viborg. The entire sewing operation 
was shut down. The Monday [5 July] after that, 80 Latvian 
seamstresses were sewing work clothing on the same machines for 
the firm of Saiva, Inc., in Sloka. 
  Currently, Nybo Jensen produces only 300 pieces of clothing 
per day in Denmark, and that is done by a subcontractor. There 
are still about 35 employees working for the company in Viborg, 
but they are only involved in administration and the design, 
cutting, and packing of clothing. 
  Danish seamstresses earning a monthly salary of between 
12,000 and 15,000 kroner cannot compete with the Latvian 
seamstresses at Saiva, who earn between 240 and 1,200 
kroner--all dependent on how quickly they can get the clothing 
through the sewing machines. 
  Even if the wages are low, the Latvian seamstresses are 
happy 
just to have work. In just two years, the number of jobs in the 
Latvian textile and clothing manufacturing industry has been 
more than cut in half. In 1991 about 56,000 people worked in the 
industry. Today that number is down to 26,000. 
  And even those seamstresses who still have jobs at one of 
the 
state enterprises do not automatically receive their wages. Many 
of them must now see to it themselves that they get their salary 
because the plants can no longer sell their goods to the former 
Soviet Union. 
  Formerly about 90 percent of Latvia's production of textiles 
and clothing went to the old empire. But that is now over. 
Business partners in the new SNG [Commonwealth of Independent 
States] countries no longer buy goods from Latvian businesses. 
<H5>  With Hat in Hand </H5>
  So many seamstresses stand in the marketplace behind the 
train station in Riga each holding the clothes she has made. 
Even if the winter weather is cold, they stand for many hours 
and display a sweater or a pair of stockings. To get a monthly 
wage, the seamstresses must go to the marketplace themselves to 
sell the clothing they have produced at the state factories. 
  That is why seamstresses stand hat in hand in front of 
textile and clothing manufacturing firms that have foreign 
capital. Because with them they are certain of getting a wage, 
even if that wage is not particularly high. 
  Many seamstresses have also been let go at Saiva in Sloka, 
where the Danish Nybo Jensen clothing factory moved its 
manufacturing. During the Soviet period, there were 3,000 
employees at the firm, but today there are only 300 employees 
working under the new ownership. Factory owner Peder Nybo Jensen 
does not own shares in the plant. 
  The three Danish firms of Spectre, Godske, and Power 
acquired 
56 percent of the shares when the state enterprise was 
privatized almost two years ago. Latvian partners have the 
remainder of the shares. Today the plant is entirely dependent 
on orders from the west. But the firm's Latvian director is 
still the same, however. 
  "I usually call myself the salaries director," said the 
director, Pavel K. Kukel. 
  "The Danish partners are responsible for the orders, the 
technology, the raw goods, sales, and marketing. From our side, 
all we contribute is cheap wages and the organization of the 
labor. Those are the principles. They are based on one fact: We 
have much lower wages than in the west," he said. 
  The only Dane who moved with Nybo Jensen's machines in the 
summer of 1993 was Laila Serritslev. She had been employed as a 
manufacturing assistant in Viborg but was offered the position 
in Latvia. 
  Here she sees to it that the quality of the Danish clothes 
is 
maintained. She is supposed to instruct the Latvian seamstresses 
in the use of the modern machines and is responsible for 
maintaining the contact with Nybo Jensen in Denmark. 
  Her base is a small office with a telephone and a fax 
machine. And squeezed in between the frequent visits to the 
production room, she tries to tie everything together in the 
office. 
<H5>  Slower Pace </H5>
  She discusses the latest patterns with designers and 
builders 
in Denmark and instructs the Latvian seamstresses. They often 
look in with questions for the Danish instructors who follow 
along with the cut out clothing from Denmark. 
  The instruction proceeds with the help of sign language and 
individual words in German or English. If things get more 
complicated, the plant's interpreter interprets into Latvian or 
Russian. 
  Laila Serritslev has not had problems instructing her 
experienced Latvian seamstresses. It has taken more time to deal 
with those without experience, but things are not more different 
here than in Denmark, she says. 
  "The Latvian seamstresses are very quality conscious. The 
clothing here at the plant is of exactly the same quality as the 
clothing manufactured back home," she stated. 
  The only difference is the pace. The Latvian seamstresses 
are 
just not used to the pace that is customary in Danish clothing 
manufacturing plants. 
  Laila Serritslev is responsible for seeing to it that orders 
are ready on time. And when the seamstresses are not that 
quick--then they have to work for longer periods. The finished 
clothing leaves for Denmark by truck each Thursday. That means 
that some of the seamstresses have very long work days. From 
0600 until 1800 hours is not uncommon. But in the future it will 
no longer be Laila Serritslev's job to see to it that the 
clothes are ready on time. After working in Sloka for six 
months, she has found a new job. Back home in Denmark. 
  But the Danish manufacturing will continue at Saiva. 
<H5>  Cheap Labor </H5>
  There are very big differences in the hourly wage in the 
textile industries in East and West Europe. Indicated on the map 
are the average hourly wages for a textile worker including 
bonuses but excluding social benefits. Social benefit costs vary 
greatly from country to country but if they are included, the 
costs are practically the same in West Europe. The figures here 
are given in Danish kroner.
