<F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, ambassador extraordinary and </F>
plenipotentiary, doctor of historical sciences: "We Should Be 
Proud of Our Mission"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation, which is currently 
overloaded to breaking point, will, of course, ultimately 
determine its fate itself, within its own walls. But the 
question also of the international climate in this difficult 
period is far from secondary. 
  The dramatic content of the external problems which Russia 
is 
encountering is obvious. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
it has for the first time in several centuries been deprived 
both of the western and Central Asia-Transcaucasus cordon. 
Beyond its new borders is an encircling focal point of 
conflicts, and 25 million of its colinguals today rank as 
foreigners. 
  To avoid being caught unawares by the further development of 
events, a sober, impartial analysis of trends in the surrounding 
world is required. It is time that Russians tired of the 
incantations about the fact that to each proclaimed course there 
is no alternative recalled the truth that the way to the future 
is always variant. As far as the possible forecasts for the 
future are concerned, four scenarios of the impact of the 
surrounding world on the national interests of the Russian 
Federation may be imagined. 
  First scenario (optimistic or positive). The 
reintegration of the economies of a sizable number of countries 
of the CIS and their political and military interface occur. 
Conflicts on Russia's borders subside. Relations with countries 
of East Europe improve. The West, primarily in the shape of the 
Seven, renders the restoration and modernization of our industry 
appreciable assistance by way of large investments and the 
lifting of trade restrictions. 
  Second scenario (pessimistic or negative). 
Economic and political disintegration of the space around Russia 
occurs. It suffocates without friends or markets. Problems of 
its security as a consequence of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons close by and/or the growth of conflicts along the 
perimeter intensify sharply. The West, denying Russia 
stabilization on its borders, engages in a tug-of-war in respect 
to the former allies and republics of the USSR, and its economic 
interaction with us amounts to shoring up Russia's raw material 
sectors. 
  Third scenario (interim or stagnant). The 
formation of a common market of the CIS comes to a standstill. 
With the East European countries--cool relations. Conflicts 
along Russia's perimeter smolder, although they do not develop 
into a conflagration. The danger of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons nearby hangs in the air. The West dribbles out economic 
assistance and politically and strategically contemplates the 
development of events. 
  Fourth scenario (sudden or spontaneous). An abrupt 
deterioration in Russian-Ukrainian relations arises. In the wake 
of the Transcaucasus, borders are revised in Central Asia 
between former Union republics. Tension is created throughout 
the system of relations with an increasingly assertive West. The 
distant surroundings could bring rolling to Russia seismic waves 
of their own tectonic shifts--the bankruptcies of a number of 
important developing countries, trade wars, and the unleashing 
of "hot wars" in the Third World or against it. 
  It is not known which of these scenarios is possible today. 
There are even more uncertainties with regard to their probable 
combinations. The sole solution for Russia in this situation is 
to be ready to defend its national interests all along the line 
and to assert its statehood. Precise reference points are 
required for this first and foremost. 
  It would seem that the cornerstone of the policy course of 
the Russian Federation should, as in critical times in the past 
also, be its clear understanding of its own significance in 
world geopolitics. A big ship has no need to be constantly 
flashing its lights. It cannot be forgotten that we are a major 
global factor, and in emergency situations, an irreplaceable 
factor. 
  The truth is that the entire history of mankind in the 
second 
millennium would have developed tragically had there not been at 
the intersection of Europe and Asia the Russian state. Three 
times it has saved the European continent, and on the last 
occasion, the world also, from unprecedented aggression. The 
first time, when, in the 13th-15th centuries, Russians shielded 
Europe from the invasion of the hordes of the descendants of 
Genghis Khan. The second, at the start of the 19th century, when 
Russia crushed the armies of Napoleon, invincible to subjugated 
Europe. The third time, in the 1940's, when two-thirds of the 
might of Hitler's fascism was pulverized and its backbone broken 
on the Soviet-German front. Who else could have done all this? 
  Russia has thus traditionally, throughout the millennium, 
acted the part of proven stabilizer of European civilization, 
guarantor of its peace, and dependable shield against history's 
biggest acts of aggression. To maintain anything different is to 
falsify. 
  It is odd under these conditions, if not insulting to 
Russians' national pride, to hear today talk to the effect that, 
for example, Russia generally (both tsarist and Soviet) has 
always been a "constant threat" to Europe. But this imaginary 
threat has simply never materialized. Or that Russia, the times 
of the USSR included, has been an invariable "potential 
aggressor." Finally, that Russia, ideology notwithstanding, is 
organically typified by sinister "imperial ambitions." And once 
again this is merely something ascribed to us, but unconfirmed. 
  Well, lack of scruples, let it pass. Gratitude is a stranger 
to politics. But today's rehashes of unfriendly tunes must not, 
in any event, provoke us into needless and humiliating excuses 
or evoke an inferiority complex. Russians have nothing to make 
excuses for. We should be proud of our noble historical mission 
and continue it. Russia was, is now, and will remain a great 
power vitally necessary to the world. Only such a confident, 
majestic position is the way to its revival. 
  A most important specific task of the Russian Federation, as 
of any other state also, is the assurance of tranquillity for 
internal transformations, primarily by way of the formation of 
friendly surroundings. Today these are primarily the CIS 
countries. Agreeing to their unnatural alienation would mean 
tearing up our own age-old roots, the earth for which cannot be 
imported from overseas. Russians do not, understandably, want 
such a development. At the recent elections, relations within 
the CIS figured as a priority in the programs of the majority of 
election associations. Of course, it can only be a question of a 
process of voluntary unity by political methods. 
  Another large-scale practical goal of the Russian Federation 
on the outside is assurance of a general healthy international 
climate. This signifies a renunciation in principle of 
confrontation with the West and a readiness for mutually 
profitable and long-term cooperation. But this presupposes also 
Russia's firm defense of its inalienable national interests and 
legitimate and equal rights in world politics and economics. In 
any event, attempts to erect either a cordon sanitaire or a wire 
mesh very close to Russia's borders are unnatural, 
discriminatory, and unacceptable. 
  Are any of these reference points a threat to anyone's 
interests? Great, sovereign Russia, with its "exceptional mien," 
is approaching the world of the future in the best possible way.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergei Strokan: "Economic Missionaries From the </F>
USA Coming to Russia"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] An American organization has suggested an original 
form of cooperation to Russian entrepreneurs: it will find 
Western specialists and pay for their work at Russian 
enterprises. 
  "The purpose of our organization is to mobilize the 
knowledge 
and resources of the US private sector for assisting reforms in 
Central Europe," says Maureen Kiser, official representative of 
the Citizens Democracy Corps (CDC) in Moscow. "We are working on 
the assumption that the transition to the market implies not 
only reforms at the macro-level, but also day-to-day work at the 
level of enterprises, public organizations and municipal 
services." 
  The Citizens Democracy Corps is an American noncommercial, 
nongovernmental organization whose Executive Committee includes 
former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former US 
Ambassador in Russia Robert Strauss, many prominent Congressmen, 
industrialists and scientists. It is financed by the state-owned 
US Agency of International Development (USAID) which has 
allotted 2.2 million dollars for the Corps' programmes. These 
programmes envisage the extension of aid by highly skilled 
consultants from the USA. 
  A distinctive feature of the CDC program is that it 
envisages 
the extension of aid in the shape of business advice on a pro 
bono basis. The Corps' staff members identify what specialists 
are needed for a particular enterprise and undertake all 
subsequent work to complete the Russian applications. They find 
specialists in the USA and pay the cost of air tickets. 
Customers must only offer local transportation, provide housing 
and an interpreter. 
  One more feature of the programme is its volunteers. They 
are 
Americans who desire to share their time and knowledge with 
those who could utilize it in Russia. 
  The work of the Citizens Democracy Corps is carried out on 
the basis of two main programmes. The first -- Business 
Entrepreneur -- is geared to small and medium-size businesses. 
"We do not impose our model, but explain things which are the 
abc's of any successful entrepreneurship making it possible to 
bring out competitive products," says Robert C. Jacoby, director 
of the Business Entrepreneur program in Moscow. 
  The second programme -- Citizens Volunteer Program -- 
focuses 
on strengthening the economic basis of public and private 
democratic institutions. This programme is used to render 
assistance to local authorities in areas such as local economic 
development and institution supporting privatization. 
  The selection of Russian customers is highly competitive. 
"For the time being we select a mere 10 percent of the total 
number of applications, counting on promising enterprises which 
seriously desire to reach out to the world market," says Robert 
C. Jacoby about his programme. 
  What requirements must an enterprise meet? The number of its 
employees vary from 50 to 1,500, the enterprise must have been 
privatized or be in the process of privatization, with priority 
being given to producer enterprises. Besides, the leadership of 
the enterprise must be receptive to new ideas. At present and in 
the next few months the Business Entrepreneur program will be 
carried out the most actively in Moscow, the Moscow Region and 
Samara. 
  The Citizens Democracy Corps has been active in Russia since 
July 1992. Here are but a few examples of its cooperation with 
Russian partners. 
  Administration of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region 
  Barbara Chronovski, business consultant with 
international experience, has helped in appraising the 
investment proposals of individual enterprises and in selecting 
the most attractive of them for the CEETEX-94 Exhibition in 
London. 
  Lima joint-stock company -- Obninsk, Kaluga Region 
  Michael Laurence, a businessman with 40 years of 
experience in different countries, has analyzed the company's 
work and suggested a plan of its reorganization. The samples of 
products were sent to the USA. The second consultant, Paul 
Kirschner, carried out a financial analysis of the activities of 
one of Lima's subunits and compiled a business plan. 
  Troika-Dialogue investment company -- Moscow 
  Robert Green, Assistant Vice-President of the RCY 
Information Technology Co., assisted in the development of the 
department's information system. 
  Moscow Public Committee Russian Reforms 
  Wendel Hulcher, a specialist with 30 years of 
experience in the fields of business, state administration and 
higher education, has helped in drafting projects for the 
organization of the Corporation for the Development of Territory 
and the Administration of Small Business. 
  Factory of Theatre Properties -- Moscow 
  Gerald Berstell, who once consulted companies such as 
IBM, Fiat, United Technologies and Nutra-Sweet, has given a 
number of recommendations for the adaptation of the methods of 
American marketing to the conditions of the enterprise's work 
and for the reorganization of the marketing system. 
  Tenzor instrument-making works -- Dubna. Moscow 
Region 
  The work of Gerry Behler, owner of the American 
consulting firm, has been instrumental in reorganizing the 
enterprise. 
  Association of charitable organizations "United Way" -- 
Voronezh 
  Jean Gerding of the American charitable organization 
"United Way" helped in the organizational rise of the 
Association of Six Charitable Funds in Voronezh, held seminars 
on the methods of fund-raising, and helped establish contacts 
with organizations capable of offering financial and other 
support in the USA.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Teslenko: "Lazare Kaplan Project </F>
Discussed in Moscow: The Yankees Want To Fortify Their Position 
in the World Raw Diamond Market"] 
  [Text] This week 
the lively discussion of the proposal by the New York firm, 
Lazare Kaplan International, to grant the Russian government a 
loan of 3.3 billion dollars for 10 years on the security of raw 
diamonds continues (KOMMERSANT wrote about this on 23 February). 
The president of Lazare Kaplan, Leon Tempelsman, made a short 
visit to Moscow from 25 February through 1 March. All his Moscow 
meetings were strictly confidential. But the editorial office of 
KOMMERSANT managed to gather some information regarding the 
position of the interested parties and to determine that final 
negotiations are planned for mid-March. 
  The precedent of large loans secured by diamonds was created 
in 1990: the DeBeers firm loaned the USSR government 1 billion 
dollars for 5 years on the security of 14.6 million carats in 
raw diamonds. Only certain details of the liquidation of the 
loans are known: payments are made under a special schedule four 
times a year and by the end of 1995 will total 1.25 billion 
dollars. After that the Ministry of Finance received a whole 
number of such proposals. Some of them have already been 
rejected and some are still being considered. In accordance with 
existing practice, all negotiations in this field were strictly 
confidential. But in the case of Lazare Kaplan International 
(LKI), there was an information leak and the American firm's 
proposal began to be discussed extensively throughout the 
diamond world. 
  In Western business circles, it is commonly thought that the 
purpose of Lazare Kaplan International's proposal is to prevent 
an excessive flow of jewel-grade diamonds out of Russia by 
transferring the entire federal reserve to the United States. 
  But according to KOMMERSANT experts' opinion, with its 
proposal LKI is demonstrating the serious intention of North 
American capital to launch a power play in the world raw diamond 
market: to drive a wedge in DeBeers' delicate relations with 
Russia, squeeze them out of the market, and free up a niche for 
Canadian diamonds (industrial production of these diamonds 
amounting to 5-7 million carats a year is expected in 3 or 4 
years). The participation of the large firm DuPont de Nemour and 
the American branch of the mining company VNR is possible in 
this project. 
  In any case it is quite unlikely that the Russian Federation 
government will accept LKI's proposal. In mid-March the deputy 
minister of finance, Anatoliy Golovatyy, plans to conduct final 
negotiations with the LKI leadership and make a counter proposal 
which is more modest in parameters, for example, a 5-year loan 
of 1 billion dollars on the security of raw diamonds worth 1.2 
billion dollars, on the condition that the specialists of 
Komdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and Precious Stones] 
make up the specifications and there is a commission of 0.1 
percent; Mr. Tempelsman will most likely reject this proposal. 
But then the Yakut government and the Almazy Rossii-Sakha 
company will apparently continue separate negotiations with LKI 
on a loan of 300 million dollars on the security of 3-4 million 
carats in raw diamonds from their own reserves. If the federal 
authorities do not take a sharply negative stand on this issue, 
an American-Yakut agreement can be expected by the summer (the 
start of the navigation season). 
  As of today, the interested parties upon whom realization of 
LKI's deal with the federal government depends take the 
following stands: 
  The Group of Experts of the Russian Federation 
President 
  "We have no instructions on the LKI proposal," the leader of 
the group, Viktor Krivov, reported yesterday. Most likely if the 
group is hired to analyze this proposal, its experts will take 
the finding prepared by the Ministry of Finance and Komdragmet 
as a basis. 
  Russian Federation Ministry of Finance 
  After Boris Fedorov's resignation, Anatoliy Golovatyy became 
responsible for preparing the text of the decision. He let it be 
known that there are "respectable, well-known banks" behind the 
LKI proposal, but it is a "raw" one. According to information 
from other sources in the Ministry of Finance, two provisions in 
the LKI proposal are absolutely unacceptable: the enormous 
amount of the security and the high commission to Mr. Tempelsman. 
  Mr. Golovatyy emphasized that the possible loan secured by 
diamonds "in no case should violate the agreement with DeBeers." 
"Whatever agreement there may be, it must be fulfilled," he 
stated. 
  Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones 
  "This is an unacceptable proposal," announced the deputy 
chairman of Komdragmet, Leonid Gurevich. It is interesting that 
2 years ago Mr. Gurevich was a supporter of diamond security and 
during his time as a member of the parliamentary committee on 
foreign investments vigorously promulgated Western banks. But 
recently his opinion did an about-face. According to his 
assertion, this happened "as a result of new guidelines in the 
diamond strategy of Russia, which today has more effective means 
of using raw diamonds on international markets in its arsenal." 
  Administration of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) 
  In the accompanying letter to Boris Yeltsin attached to the 
text of the LKI proposal, the president of Yakutia, Mikhail 
Nikolayev, not only showed fundamental interest in this idea but 
even formulated four additional points. Taking into account 
persistent efforts to return some of the diamonds from the 
federal storage facility to the republic or receive part of the 
money from transactions with them, Yakutia's interest in federal 
loans secured by diamonds becomes completely clear. 
  As KOMMERSANT found out from circles close to the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, Yakutia is hoping to receive around 10 
percent of any "diamond" loan which the federal government 
decides to take out. Moreover, Yakutia will be able to insist on 
an increase in the internal Russian quota for exports of raw 
diamonds through the DeBeers channel. 
  The Almazy Rossii-Sakha Company 
  "The company does not have instructions from the federal 
government to provide a conclusion on the LKI proposal," said 
the executive director of the company, Sergey Ulin. It is not 
impossible that such instructions will be given in the near 
future, since the company specialists, in particular advisor 
Valeriy Rudakov, participated directly in preparing the security 
agreement with DeBeers and has valuable experience in ongoing 
diamond security transactions. Obviously, a state loan secured 
by diamonds meets both the company's tactical (increasing the 
internal quota on exports) and strategic interests. 
  DeBeers 
  "LKI informed the DeBeers management of the essence of its 
proposal but does not act on DeBeers' instructions," reported 
the LKI representative, Robert Keshmia. Most likely the 
president of LKI discussed the possibility of hiring DeBeers 
specialists to make up the security specifications with the 
DeBeers executives. But there were no public announcements on 
DeBeers' part. 
  Obviously, the DeBeers management is facing a dilemma: 
either 
free Russian reserves with LKI's help, and if the security 
agreement is violated buy up the diamonds and thereby increase 
its own reserves which are already burdensome (according to 
information of the newspaper BUSINESS DAY, they are estimated at 
3.4 billion dollars), or refrain from any participation in this 
deal and reconcile itself to the "diamond drain from Russia" 
which it believes exists. 
<H5>  Description of Lazare Kaplan International </H5>
  Lazare Kaplan International was founded in 1903. It 
became a public company in 1972, the only diamond firm in the 
United States whose stock is quoted on the stock exchange. 
  LKI is a sightholder of DeBeers, participates in a 
joint advertising campaign for prestigious diamond jewelry, and 
jointly with DeBeers is realizing a project in Ghana on the 
Bayrim River. 
  LKI concluded the fiscal year which ended on 31 March 
1993 with a sales volume of 150 million dollars, which is 4 
percent higher than the result of the preceding year. The sales 
volume in cut and polished diamonds totaled 43 million dollars, 
but in March-May dropped by 30 percent. In the next half year, 
which ended on 30 November, the total volume of sales grew by 32 
percent, although cut and polished diamond sales fell by another 
6 percent. The volume of sales of raw jewel-grade diamonds rose 
by 48 percent in the second half year, which allowed profits of 
1.1 million dollars to be obtained. 
<H3>  Basic Provisions of the LKI Proposal (According to 
Information from the Western Press: Reuters, WALL STREET 
JOURNAL, BUSINESS DAY, and others): </H3>

  -  LKI is undertaking to organize a loan for Russia in the 
amount of 3.3 billion dollars for 10 years at 6 percent annual 
interest; 
  -  raw diamonds worth 4.5 billion dollars function as security 
and 
are removed from the federal storage facility in Moscow by 
representatives of the creditor; 
  -  in the event Russia violates 
the obligations, the diamond security or part of it will be sold 
through the Central Marking Organization (a trade subdivision of 
DeBeers); 
  -  for the deal LKI acts as the foreign advisor of the Russian 
government and receives 1.5 percent of the total amount of the 
loan plus costs and consultation fees (in all about 50 million 
dollars).

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aspin: "Clients of New York Bank Offered </F>
`Taiga Securities'"] 
  [Text] One of the largest American banks--Chemical 
Bank--on Monday began regular operations in the purchase and 
sale of Russian Ministry of Finance state domestic currency loan 
bonds. The emergence on the market of such a professional 
participant, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, will not only 
bring qualitatively new forms of operation with these 
securities, but will also become the source of additional 
liquidity for the still weakly organized market in currency 
bonds. 
  The "Taiga bonds" (in the terminology of the Chemical bank, 
this is what the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] state domestic 
loan bonds issued against the frozen debts of the 
Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank] are called) have 
attracted the attention of banking experts for a number of 
reasons. First of all, Chemical Bank has the reputation of being 
one of the most active dealers on the state loan bonds markets 
of the developing countries. Bank experts have experience in 
working also with Soviet debts. Specifically, the bank conducts 
active operations with the European bonds of Vneshekonombank. 
Secondly, in the opinion of the Chemical Bank, domestic currency 
loan bonds are very important from the standpoint of evolution 
of the Russian securities market. A significant volume of 
emissions, a broad investment base and diversification of 
repayment terms makes these securities one of the basic 
financial instruments in Russia. 
  As our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at Chemical Bank, 
today on the world market there is a small but stable demand for 
Russian Minfin currency bonds. Specialists at the American bank 
believe that the market in these securities is in the stage of 
formulation and a serious quantitative leap may occur only after 
certain steps have been taken in the development of its 
commercial and accounting infrastructure. Nevertheless, the 
Chemical Bank hopes that already in the near future transactions 
on currency bonds may be conducted through the international 
clearing systems Euroclear/CEDEL. In response to our KOMMERSANT 
correspondent's question about what presently hinders the 
performance of bilateral fixed quotation of these bonds (for now 
the bank buys them from its clients, setting the price in the 
process of negotiations), the bank representatives gave the 
reason as being the insufficient liquidity of the market. They 
defined the criterion of liquidity as follows: "When at least 
three large financial institutions begin to announce bilateral 
quotations of bonds for purchase and sale, and also are ready at 
any moment to buy or sell the bonds for a sum of no less than $2 
million, then we too will join in this game." 
<H6>  Commentary </H6>
  KOMMERSANT experts believe that the initiative in the 
organization of a secondary market in currency bonds will 
nevertheless come from the Russian banks. Judging by the 
available information, at the beginning of the second quarter 
the largest banks will be able to assure the bond market that 
level of liquidity which experienced Western financial 
institutions such as Chemical Bank demand. Moreover, the rapid 
rates of development of the commercial networks of the MFD 
[Interbank Financial House] and the Cash Union will already by 
summer make it possible for the banks to conduct trade through 
professionally organized dealing systems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Decline in Import of Basic Food </F>
Products in January Exceeded 50 Percent"] 
  [Text] The foreign trade turnover of Russia in January of 
1994 declined by 7.6 percent as compared with January of 1993, 
and comprised $3.6 billion, according to the operational data of 
Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics]. The positive balance 
reached $1.4 billion, as compared with $1 billion in January of 
last year. 
  The volume of export comprised $2.5 billion, increasing by 
1.3 percent as compared with January of 1993 (we must note that 
the average export prices on a number of goods in January of 
1994 were significantly lower than the January 1993 level). The 
relative share of power sources within the structure of export 
declined by 7 percent, and comprised 50 percent. Export 
deliveries of crude oil declined by 16 percent, to 5 million 
tonnes. On the other hand, deliveries of petroleum products 
increased by 38 percent, to 1.676 million tonnes, and of natural 
by 14 percent, to 10.121 billion cubic meters. 
  Import comprised $1.1 billion, declining by 23 percent as 
compared with January of last year. Import deliveries of basic 
staple food products continued to decline. The import of grain 
declined by 57 percent, of meat--by 64 percent, of butter--by 91 
percent, and of tea--by 63 percent. The main reasons for the 
continued decline in import, explained the deputy chief of the 
MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] Main Economic 
Administration, Vladimir Kiselev, were the introduction of 
increased excise tax rates on certain types of goods at the end 
of 1993, the repeal of subsidy coefficients on centralized 
import for state needs which became effective on 1 January 1994, 
as well as the lack of resolution in the question of exempting 
goods of centralized import from the payment of NDS [value-added 
tax] and import duties. A significant role here was played also 
by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the ruble at the 
beginning of the year, as well as the increase in import tariffs 
which was planned for March of 1994.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Panov, </F>
deputy minister of foreign affairs, by Vladimir Abarinov; place 
and date not given: "The Asian Year of the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs: Aleksandr Panov: Power Politics Is 
Ineffective in the East"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Nikolayevich Panov is a career 
diplomat. His professional biography began with the position of 
reviewer in the Far East Department of the USSR Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in 1968. He then worked for several years as 
part of the permanent mission of the USSR at the United Nations 
in New York. In the period 1983-1988 he was first secretary and 
then counselor at the USSR Embassy in Japan. At the end of the 
1980's he worked at the Pacific and Southeast Asia Desk in the 
USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in the period 1990-1992, 
as chief of the desk. Prior to his appointment as deputy 
minister of foreign affairs, he was ambassador of Russia in the 
Republic of Korea. His diplomatic rank is ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary. He is a candidate of 
historical sciences. 
  This year will be the year of Asia for the Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of the Russian Federation, declared in an interview with 
our SEGODNYA correspondent. Russian diplomacy is setting itself 
the assignment here not only of maintaining good-neighbor 
relations with all Asian countries but also of becoming an 
active part of the economic life of the region and contributing 
to ensuring that Asia become a region of stability, security, 
and cooperation. An extensive program of exchanges of visits is 
planned. The minister of foreign affairs and then the chairman 
of the PRC, the president of the Republic of Korea, and the 
prime minister of India are expected in Moscow this year, and 
visits by the Vietnamese and Mongolian prime ministers are 
possible. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Government of the 
Russian Federation, will head for Beijing in June, and a Russian 
delegation will take part in an ASEAN ministerial session in 
Bangkok in July. The deputy minister observed that greater 
attention to the rapidly developing region has come to be paid 
by Russian private business, Far East business particularly. The 
new commercial structures are accounting for up to 50 percent of 
commodity turnover in trade with certain Asian countries. 
According to Aleksandr Panov, Russia could not export such a 
quantity of finished goods to any other region of the world. 
  The Russo-Japanese consultations at deputy foreign minister 
level which were held in Moscow recently, the diplomat said, 
showed that "quickly arriving at a peace treaty" and, 
consequently, resolving the territorial problem were impossible 
under the current conditions. The parties understand this and 
intend in the immediate future to concentrate on specific 
questions in order to gradually create a "new atmosphere" in 
bilateral relations. In the course of the consultations it was 
arranged, as we all know, that Tsutomo Hata, minister of foreign 
affairs of Japan, would visit Moscow in March. As was to be 
understood from the statements of Mr. Panov, no breakthroughs 
are to be expected from this visit. 
  To the correspondent's question as to how the Japanese side 
is reacting to Moscow's proposals concerning joint economic 
activity in the "Northern territories," the deputy minister 
responded that "the Japanese are giving our position a guarded 
reception": Joint ventures on the South Kurils must observe 
Russian legislation, and this, from Japan's viewpoint, is a 
violation of Japan's sovereignty. Mr. Panov disagreed that the 
numerous violations of Russia's border by Japanese fishermen 
were being perpetrated for political reasons and with the direct 
support of Tokyo officialdom. The border incidents, the diplomat 
declared, are explained primarily by economic factors. Moscow is 
raising the question of fishing in the area of the Kuril chain 
in strict terms, nonetheless, it is obvious that an economic 
solution needs to be found. A version of such a solution is 
already being applied in the area of Signalnyy Island, where the 
Japanese have obtained the right to procure sea kale on a 
compensation basis. 
  Things are comparatively better with respect to observance 
of 
the moratorium on fishing in the central Sea of Okhotsk. This 
area is not part of Russia's economic zone but Russia deemed it 
possible to announce last year a unilateral moratorium in 
connection with the fact that the reduction in the stocks of 
pollock had reached crisis point. At the present time neither 
Japan and nor South Korea are fishing, and China has reduced it 
25 percent and is prepared to examine the question of 
compensation, that is, the exchange of this area for another 
within Russia's economic zone. This leaves Poland, which is 
agreeing to no restrictions. 
  Aleksandr Panov is not disposed to dramatize the fact of 
Russia's nonaccession to the Prevention of Pollution of the Seas 
Convention. Moscow and Tokyo are conducting negotiations on 
assistance in the utilization [utilizatsiya] of Russia's liquid 
radioactive waste, specifically, the financing of the 
construction of a repository for such waste. Until there is a 
repository, there will be no further disposals, which has been 
stated clearly. 
  But the most serious problem of the region is undoubtedly 
the 
DPRK's nuclear program. It is being complicated by Pyongyang's 
hard-line negotiating position, Mr. Panov said. The North Korean 
side is endeavoring to compensate each positive step on its part 
with return concessions by Washington. As a result a specific 
situation has been created, the deputy minister observed. On the 
one hand inspections of nuclear facilities are the prerogative 
of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Authority], on the 
other, the DPRK is preferring to negotiate on this topic with 
the Americans. But there is a "third angle" also: the 
North-South negotiations on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. Untangling this knot is not easy, Mr. Panov said. 
Moscow, he declared, occupies a balanced position. The Sarajevo 
example has shown that a positive result cannot be achieved with 
ultimatums. Power politics will produce nothing in the East: 
History testifies that these countries are capable even in a 
difficult situation of sustaining quite strong political 
pressure. If, despite all the diplomatic efforts, the question 
is put to the UN Security Council for consideration, Russia will 
act circumspectly there also. 
  The Russian-North Korean intergovernmental agreement on the 
basis of which from 15,000 to 20,000 lumberjacks of the DPRK 
have been working at Khabarovsk Kray and Amur Oblast timber 
industry enterprises expired on 1 January. In this connection 
the SEGODNYA correspondent asked about the future of this 
document and, most importantly, about the legal status of the 
Korean timber industry enterprises, which are known for their 
mass violations of human rights. The agreement, the deputy 
minister observed, has expired and is operating now only "within 
a particular framework." But dropping it altogether would not 
seem possible: The local authorities maintain that they have no 
one with whom to replace the Koreans. A new negotiating 
position, with which we will resume negotiations in the very 
near future, is being shaped in the government at this time. In 
any event, whatever the economic agreements, the state within a 
state and the ex-territoriality of the Korean settlements have 
been done away with, was Aleksandr Panov's assurance. 
  The deputy minister commented on the reports of President 
Yeltsin's recent message to Indonesian President Suharto. The 
message, Mr. Panov reported, had been preceded by an appeal to 
Russia on the part of a number of members of the Nonaligned 
Movement proposing that it join the movement as an observer. 
Moscow deemed the proposal flattering and expedient. It is this 
that was the subject of Yeltsin's message sent to Suharto, as 
the present chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. According to 
the movement's charter, a member of the Security Council may not 
be a member, but is entitled to apply for observer status.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Tkachenko: "Preliminary Results: One Year </F>
After Kim Yong-Sam Took Office as South Korean President"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Big hopes were placed on a new 
policy in Seoul regarding North Korea and reducing tensions on 
the peninsula. The president conceived the idea of a gradual 
convergence between North and South resulting from joint efforts 
to overcome animosity and mistrust, broaden cooperation, and 
ensure mutual coexistence and prosperity. The key feature of the 
new ideas was that the convergence was to be voluntary and 
democratic, i.e., the majority of the population in the North 
and South would agree to live together at the same standard of 
living in two parts of a unified country. 
  Nonetheless, in spite of the proclaimed declarations 
relations between North and South have noticeably worsened in 
the last year. The euphoria caused by the sensationalized 
agreements reached in 1991-1992 on reconciliation and reducing 
tensions, was replaced by a deep pessimism. Contacts in 
humanitarian and cultural spheres that had been maintained even 
during sharp confrontation were broken off. 
  The cause for stagnation in inter-Korean relations involved 
a 
nuclear arms problem on the peninsula, MAGATE [IAEA, 
International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of both DPRK 
nuclear sights and military bases in the North and South, and a 
bilateral agreement on a nuclear-free zone. No agreement was 
successfully reached on these issues during inter-Korean 
negotiations, and now a dialog is underway between the U.S. and 
the DPRK. 
  There were no major events that transpired last year in the 
development of Russian-South Korean relations. A feeling of 
dissatisfaction arose in connection with Russia's failure to act 
as a bridge between North and South Korea when a sharp political 
crisis followed the DPRK's decision in March to withdraw from a 
nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement. However, what bearing 
could Russia have had on the situation after relations became 
paralyzed between Russia and the DPRK for ideological reasons? 
The role traditionally belonging to Russia as a peacekeeper and 
guarantor of security in Korea has now gone to China, which is 
now skillfully performing these duties to its obvious benefit. 
  No boom in economic relations has taken place between Russia 
and the Republic of Korea. The exchange of goods between them 
has not even exceeded the 2 billion dollar mark, that is, it has 
remained at the same level as our trade in 1988 with North 
Korea. Not one of the 23 projects for economic and 
scientific-technical cooperation submitted for review to the 
South Korean government by Russia has been realized. The problem 
of Russia repaying 1.5 billion dollars in credit extended to us 
by the Republic of Korea, has also not yet been resolved. 
  This year Kim Yong-Sam will visit our country. Now is the 
time for tallying up results, studying prospects for 
strengthening cooperation between our countries to our mutual 
benefit, and preparing new terms and agreements. The 
Russian-Korean summit meeting, as expected, will allow for 
making our relations more dynamic and purposeful. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Sinologist V.S. Myasnikov by Andrey </F>
Vinogradov; place and date not given: "Chinese Civilization Has 
Proven Its Capacity for Survival"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Stepanovich Myasnikov is a well-known 
Sinologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far 
East Institute, and leader of the Russia-China Center. The 
author of more than 200 scientific works on the history of 
Russo-Chinese and Soviet-Chinese relations and problems of the 
development of countries of Northeast Asia. 
  [Vinogradov] Vladimir Stepanovich, you were a member of the 
delegation that accompanied Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs 
of the Russian Federation, to China. In connection with the fact 
that there was quite scant coverage of Kozyrev's trip in the 
press, could you describe this visit in somewhat more detail? As 
far as I know, the visit is seen in the Foreign Ministry as 
having been exclusively successful. It did not seem so to me.... 
  [Myasnikov] In order to evaluate the success of a visit it 
is 
necessary to compare the purposes that were set for it and the 
results that were obtained. 
  This visit had been planned long since, but its preparation 
was dragged out, and then the elections, formation of the 
cabinet, and so forth were approaching. A decision was 
ultimately made on a visit at government level by the foreign 
minister. The main task consisted of two components. First, 
following the visit of President Yeltsin, it was necessary to 
conduct a stock-taking, as it were, of how the agreements were 
being fulfilled. And, as practice shows, things are not moving 
successfully in all directions. This inspection purpose was 
combined with a desire to make good what had not been done 
during President Yeltsin's visit. You know that he was unable to 
go to Shenzhen, and a purpose of the visit, therefore, was a 
trip to the free economic zones. Specifically, the area of Heihe 
and Blagoveshchensk on the Russo-Chinese border, where it is 
planned to create a joint zone. And, of course, Shenzhen--a zone 
that has been in operation for 15 years now, which is the 
best-known in China, and which has achieved excellent results. 
The Chinese Government has decided, as you know, to make a 
northern Shenzhen of Heihe. 
  [Vinogradov] These matters are more within the jurisdiction 
of Shokhin, it would seem to me, not Kozyrev.... 
  [Myasnikov] You are right. As I said, the visit of another 
member of the government had been planned originally, but in 
connection with various matters (I dislike the term "government 
crisis") the most suitable figure in this case was the minister 
of foreign affairs. But traveling with him were experts, 
administration chiefs, people involved in actual economics.... 
And some of them, what is more, Ivanov, chief of the 
Administration of Chita Oblast, and Volkov, chief of the 
Administration of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, say, had already 
been to Shenzhen as part of the group accompanying the president. 
  The appropriate invitations were made to the Chinese side 
during Yeltsin's visit for a return visit. But changes had 
occurred in this time in the Chinese leadership also, and it was 
necessary to extend an invitation to the new persons. In 
addition, agreement was reached on the visit to China this 
spring of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and problems of bilateral 
relations, border problems primarily, were discussed. You know 
that the transparency of the border and its openness and 
penetrability are a two-edged sword. On the one hand this 
stimulates border trade, on the other, a negative effect is 
manifested also: The potential for crime increases. Quite broad 
masses of representatives of the Chinese and Russian sides are 
coming into direct contact, but these are not, to be blunt, the 
best representatives of the two peoples. Prior to this, the 
"main conduits of relations with China" with us were L. Tolstoy, 
Gorkiy, a whole group of prominent Soviet writers, and so forth. 
Their works and they themselves are known in China and treated 
with great respect. Exhibitions of the Chinese artist Xu Beihong 
were held in our country in the 1930's, and the actor Mei 
Langfang, many theatrical ensembles, and so forth visited us. 
Today this line of cultural relations is somehow dormant, and 
quite a different line of interaction has emerged instead, which 
is causing quite a good deal of negative consequences of a 
purely psychological plane both in China and in Russia. The 
nations' ideas of one another are changing, and not for the 
better, what is more. This could create distorted stereotypes, 
which would influence our countries' relations in the future, in 
the 21st century. You know that, according to information of the 
Chinese side, at the end of the past month there were over 2 
million Chinese on the territory of Russia. This figure is 
growing all the time. How many Russians, I cannot account for.... 
  [Vinogradov] Quite a few also, particularly in Beijing. But 
not millions, of course.... 
  [Myasnikov] If we wish to achieve mutual understanding, 
which 
is very important for good-neighborliness and for the strategic 
development of the relations of the two countries, order needs 
to be brought to bear. This does not mean that we have to ban or 
close down some things--we need elementary order at the state 
level. And the Chinese side is better and more successful here, 
as a rule. For example, they entrusted Heilongjiang Province 
with dealing with Russia and the CIS. Everything is specialized 
there: There is a permanent annual fair in Harbin and there is a 
particular set of companies that pursue commerce. On our side, 
on the other hand, total freedom, but not in the best meaning of 
this word. It was decided as the first order of business, 
therefore, to establish visa conditions. 
  [Vinogradov] As far as I recall, these matters were raised 
in 
the course of Sergey Shakhray's trip to China last July also.... 
  [Myasnikov] Shakhray discussed primarily models of national 
relations within the country. He was beginning his campaign as 
leader of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] at that 
time. China is the same type of multinational country as Russia 
and is typologically very close--the history of the creation of 
the two states is very similar. True, Shakhray had a mandate 
from the Siberian Accord public organization to discuss 
questions of border cooperation also. But I believe that neither 
he nor the Chinese side were prepared for a serious discussion. 
In this case this is within the jurisdiction of the minister of 
foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs, and minister of 
state security. 
  [Vinogradov] As far as I know, the Chinese and Russian 
Ministries of Security have signed an agreement on the mutual 
extradition of criminals.... 
  [Myasnikov] Yes, but besides this, a new agreement has now 
been signed which amounts to the following: Persons who are 
truly engaged in developing trade and economic, scientific and 
technological, and other relations between China and Russia and 
Russia and China have preferential conditions for crossing the 
border. They may be issued multiple visas and one-year, two-year 
passports. Obstacles are put in the way only of people engaging 
in semi-legal and illegal business and making episodic raids on 
the neighboring territory. 
  [Vinogradov] How is the one distinguished from the other? 
  [Myasnikov] I agree that making the distinction is 
difficult. 
Development will, obviously, be along the lines of the 
consolidation of firms. If a firm has given a good account of 
itself, its representatives will be granted preferential 
conditions. I recall that we were visited here in the institute 
by staff of the embassy and the trade mission of the PRC in 
charge of economic problems, and they were severely critical of 
us at that time: "You sign an agreement immediately with the 
first Chinese who gives you his card. But this does not mean 
that he is a person backed by a real business or administrative 
structure. It is not hard to make calling cards in China." 
  [Vinogradov] I also have repeatedly taken part in such 
"negotiations" which subsequently were not continued. More, when 
I would attempt to find in Beijing the office of the "major 
firms" with whom we had been negotiating in Moscow, this proved 
more often than not to be a tiny stall. 
  [Myasnikov] For the entire world practice of the market 
economy, checking out one's partner and his actual possibilities 
is one of the main rules. Aside from the new rules of visa 
conditions, therefore, other agreements will be signed also. But 
not all at once. This needs to be done thoughtfully to avoid 
foolish mistakes. 
  In addition, serious regional problems, the Korean problem 
specifically, were discussed. As we all know, following the 
meeting in Seattle, this has become a controlled problem, and 
China is now performing a principal role in the achievement of a 
balance of interests. The proximity of positions was discussed 
and confirmed. 
  A second important question that was of interest to the 
Russian side was Russia's participation in the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Council (APEC). As we all know, a three-year moratorium 
on the admittance of new members to the council was imposed in 
Seattle. The question of the need to make an exception for 
Russia was raised in the course of the visit. The Chinese side 
took note of our wish. 
  [Vinogradov] But did not express a reciprocal wish to 
actively support the Russian aspiration.... 
  [Myasnikov] It cannot make such declarations immediately. I 
can give you my viewpoint, which I conveyed to representatives 
of the Chinese side before, during, and after the visit. We 
should not be arguing along the lines of the "you help me, I'll 
help you" principle, of course. The Soviet Union formerly did a 
great deal for China's admittance to the United Nations. The 
support was very strong, even in the confrontation years. We 
refused to sign the San Francisco Treaty because the PRC had not 
been invited. But this does not mean that China must today pay 
us back. China should proceed from its own interests. 
  [Vinogradov] How far is it in China's interests to promote 
an 
increase in Russia's economic role in Asia, thereby creating 
competition for itself and depriving itself of a monopoly 
position in the sphere of contacts with the Russian Federation 
to a large extent? 
  [Myasnikov] I will explain it this way. Very important 
economic projects, in which China also has an interest, are 
being advanced at the present time. The idea of the creation of 
a free trade zone in Northeast Asia, say, which would encompass 
China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Russia, has been mooted 
for two years now. Without Russia it would be impossible to link 
this zone with the North American Free Trade Area: Mexico, 
Canada, and the United States, in Alaska. Could such a project 
be realized without Russia's membership of APEC? Or, say, the 
far-reaching "Yakut gas" project--the transfer of Yakut gas to 
China and South Korea. I believe that this would be extremely 
difficult on a bilateral basis. The Tyumenjiang project is also 
part of these integration economic processes, and Russia's 
participation is essential not only, of course, in the United 
Nations, where this project is being stewarded, but in APEC 
also. Of course, quite a tough struggle is under way in 
structures of an economic kind, but common rules of the game for 
this region should be formulated, and formulating such rules 
without Russia would be unrealistic. 
  [Vinogradov] You always emphasize in your articles and 
speeches that Russo-Chinese relations represent a zone of 
contact of two different civilizations. To what extent are 
psychological differences influencing specific bilateral 
relations? 
  [Myasnikov] We are undoubtedly representatives of two 
different civilization complexes. We will not say whose 
civilization is the more ancient, this is not the issue. But for 
an understanding of one's partner, an understanding of the 
motives of his policy, and an understanding of his political 
mentality a knowledge of civilization features is 
extraordinarily important. I have the impression, what is more, 
that the Chinese side has progressed further in this respect 
than us. It is possible that the Sinologists, you and I, are at 
fault here. The Chinese side is making very skillful use of the 
particular features of the Russian mentality and knows history 
well, which is a hallmark of far from all our representatives. 
  China is today laying the foundations of a new state of the 
21st century, and its policy is pursuing long-term goals. The 
main thing here is plan orientation and precise adherence to the 
charted plans. And a particular feature of the Chinese 
mentality, what is more, is the fact that the plans are 
formulated by all the participants in the foreign economic 
process. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs or some other body over 
it may collate a whole number of proposals, but each 
organization necessarily has its own plan of interaction with 
its partners, which, as a rule, is not the case with the Russian 
side. In a word, it is necessary in all situations to take 
account of a whole number of salient features of Chinese custom 
and the Chinese mentality. 
  [Vinogradov] In respect to the human rights problem, for 
example.... 
  [Myasnikov] If we are speaking of human rights, the 
millennial experience of Chinese civilization and Chinese 
philosophical social thought has formulated entirely different 
criteria of the relationship of the individual and society, the 
individual and the state. What are Western human rights today? 
They are Protestant morals in generalized form. At the start of 
the 19th century a number of founders of American democracy 
formulated some basic parameters, in their opinion, of 
democratic institutions for their country. They then embedded 
some messianic character in these notions of theirs and began to 
spread them to other countries. But inter-civilization 
convergence should not even contemplate the imposition of one's 
own historical experience. This is the mistake of the West 
today: demanding that China conform to its ideas or adopt its 
human rights legislation. It is necessary to perceive one's 
partner in international relations as he is, not attempt to 
remake him. Otherwise there will be conflicts. China understands 
Western experience and studies it, but cannot adapt it in a few 
years. There has to be a sufficient amount of time for an 
evaluation of the moral principles of Protestantism also. From 
China's viewpoint, they could seem absurd. After all, a 
beautiful European opera could be perceived by the Chinese as 
some preposterous cacophony. Just as Chinese traditional music 
is not accepted by Europeans. 
  Political music is heterogeneous also. Of course, it is the 
job of diplomacy to level these differences. But diplomatic 
barriers cannot be crossed. The ideas of the Chinese concerning 
human rights are shaped by Confucian precepts, which exist in 
society. These are by no means communist inventions, against 
which the West is struggling. The Chinese communists, 
incidentally, have always made skillful use of their people's 
traditional experience and have adopted it in propaganda and 
ideological work. In the precepts that exist in China today 
there is a very great deal that is purely traditional. Let us 
take a look. A campaign to limit the birthrate is being 
conducted in China at this time. This is the sole rational 
policy possible in this country in this specific historical 
period. And combating it from the standpoints of human rights, 
as the American Congress has done at times, is to become 
ridiculous. 
  [Vinogradov] The events in Tienanmen Square in 1989, for 
example. I personally encountered in China the fact that even 
liberals and intellectuals today justify the actions of the 
authorities in that situation since this helped preserve 
stability in society. Except for the students who took part in 
these events themselves, almost no one in China now sees them as 
some crime on the part of Deng Xiaoping and others. They regard 
them as a tragedy, but historically necessary. 
  [Myasnikov] Yes, I also heard such opinions, and we need to 
try to understand them. Remember the events in Kwangju, in South 
Korea, when the students rebelled against the then Chon Tu-hwan 
regime. After all, liberal thought did not condemn the South 
Korean regime of that time for the shoot-up in Kwangju. Nor 
during their visits did the prime ministers of China and Japan 
condemn the events in Kwangju, but observed: There must be 
stability in Asia. That is, stability at the state level, at the 
level of international relations, was put above democratic 
aspirations. This is the point. So let us leave things Western 
to the West, things Eastern, to the East. 
  The West has been operating in the East for five centuries 
now--since the times of the great geographical discoveries. And 
throughout these centuries the West has continually attempted to 
bring here at times Christian standards, at times, Catholicism, 
but the foundations of the oriental civilizations have proven 
quite strong. In addition, they are today undergoing a 
renaissance, a positive renaissance, I would say, because the 
"dragons" of East Asia have largely grown up in the soil of 
Confucianism and traditional ideology. So we should not be 
fighting inter-civilization differences, we should be adapting 
to them. 
  [Vinogradov] What are the prospects of Russia's relations 
with China? After all, according to some estimates, China has 
today reached the position of the third economic power. China's 
role and influence in the world are increasing, and its overall 
might is growing. Is this not a challenge to Russia, for having 
such a neighbor is far from safe.... 
  [Myasnikov] We have today entered an entirely new historical 
period, and we need to look at this with open eyes. China's rate 
of development is outstripping that of Russia. Although many 
people have yet to recognize this, we will have to build a new 
model of relations with China. A particular feature of this 
model is the fact that China is today the world's third economic 
power, and the decline in production in Russia is continuing. I 
do not believe that Russia will in a year or two in a sudden 
spurt catch up with and overtake China. Russia is not today, 
thank God, confronted with the task of catching up and 
overtaking--its task is that of survival. It is under these 
conditions that the new model of relations will take shape. Full 
consideration of the national interests of Russia and the 
civilization features of both Russia and China are needed here, 
therefore, as are very well considered measures for the economic 
development of our Far East and Siberian oblasts that abut China. 
  The book "21st Century--Age of Chinese Civilization" has 
just 
been published by the Renmin Chubanshe official publishers. A 
very interesting book, which says that Chinese civilization is 
superior to other civilizations in terms of the essential 
characteristics, humanitarian parameters primarily, contained in 
it. And this will ensure China's triumph in the 21st century on 
a world scale. Without bloody clashes and without wars, mankind 
will be forced to acknowledge the superiority of Chinese 
civilization. 
  [Vinogradov] And if it does not so acknowledge it without 
wars and clashes? 
  [Myasnikov] I realize that this could, perhaps, be an 
extreme 
viewpoint. But such viewpoints reflect a growth of national 
self-awareness connected with economic growth, with the growth 
of the might of the country and China's new world role. This is 
the first point. Second, such forecasts usually appear in 
periods of a millennium--a change in the span of 1,000 years. 
Some are filled with eschatological sentiments: The end of the 
world is nigh, others, on the contrary, see new horizons. I 
believe that the horizons of the 21st century are, truly, 
visible and that many of its parameters may be imagined quite 
realistically even today. And China will, of course, perform a 
principal role in the world arena as an economically, 
politically, and, yes, culturally most powerful state.... 
  [Vinogradov] Militarily also, I believe.... 
  [Myasnikov] I proceed from the fact that military factors 
will be on the wane in the 21st century. Nonetheless, 
competition will develop primarily according to economic and 
cultural indicators. In addition, China has one strategic trump 
card, which was planned by Mao Zedong even and, perhaps, by 
earlier rulers also--the size of its population. I do not 
believe that it will diminish appreciably in the 21st century. 
  [Vinogradov] We need to take account also of the upcoming 
unification with Hong Kong and, possibly, with Taiwan. In 
addition, there is Singapore, where ethnic Chinese constitute 70 
percent of the population. 
  [Myasnikov] Yes, the Great China idea. If these countries' 
GNP's are added together, the result will be a supergiant. 
  [Vinogradov] There are, in addition, the huaqiao scattered 
throughout the world.... 
  [Myasnikov] The huaqiao mean relations with the whole world. 
Plus a compact Chinese economic community furnished with all the 
latest achievements of Western civilization and aware, what is 
more, of its messianic role, if you will, in bringing the whole 
of the rest of the world closer not to Protestant morals but to 
Confucian values. Let us look at the Europeans, the Americans. 
After all, many of them are enraptured by East Asian 
civilization and culture. Those who know and perceive it. 
Adaptation is taking place quite easily here also. 
  I believe, therefore, that the talk about the possible 
disintegration of China at the national or economic, provincial, 
administrative level--these are all hopes which are, perhaps, 
desired, but which are unrealistic. Chinese civilization has in 
the four millennia of its existence and written history proven 
its exceptional capacity for survival.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imangali Tasmagambetov, aide to the </F>
president of Kazakhstan, by Sergey Leskovskiy and Turekhan 
Daniyarov; place and date not given: "Defining a Sprint 
Distance"] 
  [Text] How is the president's team formed? What 
problems does the president's inner circle work on? These 
questions are definitely of interest to many citizens of 
Kazakhstan. Therefore we decided to pose these questions to 
Imangali Tasmagambetov. Our choice is not accidental: Imangali 
Nurgaliyevich has daily contacts with the president probably 
more often than anybody else, participates in discussions of 
various problems, and sees him during moments of rest. 
  [Question] Why not start the conversation with the question 
of how you met the president? 
  [Tasmagambetov] It was in 1989, on the eve of the 
organizational plenum of the Central Committee of Kazakhstan 
Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], to which 
Nursultan Abishevich was invited. On the agenda were 
multicandidate elections for first secretary, with six 
contenders on the slate. Before the plenum began, Nursultan 
Abishevich gathered all six and announced over a cup of tea: 
"Consider us acquainted. I completely trust your plenum and am 
ready to work with whoever is elected." 
  FROM OUR FILE. Before becoming the president's aide, 
Imangali Tasmagambetov had worked as a teacher, first secretary 
of the Atyrau Oblast Komsomol Committee, and first secretary of 
the Kazakhstan Komsomol Central Committee, as well as chairman 
of the republic State Committee for Youth Affairs. Candidate of 
philosophy. Married. Father of three. The youngest--a son--just 
turned one month. 
  [Question] Did you study in Atyrau? 
  [Tasmagambetov] No. I graduated from the Department of 
Natural Sciences and Geography of the Urals Pedagogical 
Institute. Its distinction lay in its preservation of the 
traditions established by talented scholars from Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. Many are no longer with us, but the traditions 
remained in Uralsk. I consider myself very lucky to have 
graduated from this school. 
  [Question] Was your candidate thesis in philosophy somehow 
related to pedagogic issues? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Not quite. It was titled "Philosophical 
Aspects of Ecological Problems." The topic, as you may see, is 
on the border of two sciences--geography and biology. The task 
was to attempt to analyze, by comparing the interrelations of 
various social groups, their views on ecological problems. 
  [Question] You see in your line of work how the president's 
team is formed. Our readers will probably be interested to know 
about this process. 
  [Tasmagambetov] Forming a team is a complex process, since 
we 
are talking about putting together a collective of like-minded 
people. This means it is necessary not only to find intelligent, 
competent specialists. It is also necessary for each person who 
comes to work here to be able to see the problem they are facing 
from the viewpoint of the state. And while in the past 
candidates for high-level positions were selected from among 
people with "practical experience," now everyone in the 
president's circle must be first and foremost an ideologue, 
whether we are speaking of banking or a market economy. 
  [Question] How many specialists are there working on the 
president's team? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Three hundred and ninety persons in 
positions 
of responsibility. 
  [Question] That is all?! 
  [Tasmagambetov] Yes. You are surprised, but some people may 
think this is too many. I will tell you for comparison that just 
a few years ago the apparat of the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist 
Communist Youth League] Central Committee, which I knew, had 
more than 1,000 staff in positions of responsibility. Now we are 
talking about the apparat of the president of a large state. You 
cannot economize on talented specialists. We are used to 
economizing, and that is why we live such a life... 
  [Question] But people not only come. To put together a 
perfect team, you have to let some go... 
  [Tasmagambetov] This is very painful. And not only for those 
who have to leave. I have noticed that Nursultan Abishevich 
takes it very hard when he has to part with someone. And the 
main reason is not personal qualities but the loss of the sense 
of the times: For a number of reasons a person cannot work in 
the dynamic rhythm life demands of us, does not perceive the 
logic of change. 
  [Question] By the way, speaking about dynamics. What does 
the 
president's day look like? 
  [Tasmagambetov] His schedule is very busy. As a rule, no 
days 
off. Take, for instance, a recent day--10 March. From 0900 to 
0930 the president prepared for his working day and reviewed 
documents. At 0930 he received the leaders of another state. At 
1030 at an expanded meeting he listened to the report on 
recently held elections. From 1200 to 1600 (with a break for 
lunch) he conducted intensive negotiations with representatives 
of the Chevron company. From 1600 to 1800 listened to a report 
on the progress of privatization in Semipalatinsk Oblast. From 
1800 to 2000 the president looked through business mail, 
conducted telephone conversations with top officials of oblasts 
and the republic. At 2000 he began studying documents related to 
a brief visit by Geydar Aliyev. From 2100 to 0030--meeting with 
Aliyev and a press conference for journalists on the results of 
the visit. 
  [Question] Are you with the president the entire work day? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Yes. I am at work by 0800 in order to 
prepare 
all the necessary information for the president, and go home 
half an hour to an hour after Nursultan Abishevich leaves, after 
"transcribing" his comments and proposals regarding the next 
work day. 
  [Question] What else is included in your duties? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Together with members of other departments, 
I 
study and analyze the sociopolitical situation in the republic. 
  [Question] How do you manage to sustain such a pace? 
  [Tasmagambetov] I have to. You should ask whether the 
president has any chance to rest. 
  [Question] Consider it asked. 
  [Tasmagambetov] Generally, it is practically impossible to 
talk him into taking some rest. But sometimes he does cave in 
and leaves for an hour to shake off the stress on the tennis 
court. I have noticed that tennis is the best way for the 
president to relieve tension. Once a week is an absolute 
necessity. And also--songs. You will be surprised, even 
professional performers are surprised, that Nursultan Abishevich 
knows by heart a tremendous number of songs--both modern and 
folk. Generally, the Nazarbayevs are a very musical family. As a 
example I will tell you an incident that took place in America 
during a reception given by Vice President Gore. Gore told his 
guests what a wonderful singer Nursultan Abishevich is, 
recollecting his visit to Kazakhstan. The guests began to 
applaud and asked him to sing. They came out as a 
trio--Nursultan Abishevich, Sara Alpysovna, and their daughter. 
They sang together, and then Dariga sang a song on Abay's 
lyrics. And finally the Americans were totally elated when they 
heard Dariga sing an Elvis Presley song in English. Nursultan 
Abishevich joked later: "All the things you have to do for your 
country!" 
  [Question] Does Nursultan Abishevich visit his native parts? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Over the seven months that I have been 
working with the president, this has happened only once, when he 
went to a class reunion on the occasion of his school's 
anniversary. 
  [Question] We have been talking to you for an hour now, and 
we have noticed, Imangali Nurgaliyevich, that during this time 
you were twice asked for an appointment. And you did not say 
either "yes" or "no." Is this diplomatic finesse? 
  [Tasmagambetov] This is reality. I understand very well that 
in both instances an appointment is needed on an urgent matter. 
But there is a tight schedule, and it is very difficult to 
squeeze anything in. Therefore, both meetings had to be moved to 
another time, after coordinating with the president. Right now 
the president's schedule is filled by the hour for a month 
ahead. International visits are scheduled and discussed half a 
year in advance. 
  [Question] What particularly concerns the president today? 
  [Tasmagambetov] First and foremost economic issues. The 
president is not satisfied with the progress of reform in the 
republic. Therefore, in the second part of April and in May a 
considerable amount of time will be devoted to the country's 
economic problems, in order to define in detail the strategy and 
tactics of the reform. The second item that concerns the 
president is preservation of stability and interethnic accord in 
our society. You can put it this way: The president's 
unchangeable credo at all times is the idea of a single economic 
and spiritual space. 
  [Question] We are frequently visited by foreign consultants. 
This practice is somewhat disturbing. Sometimes one gets the 
impression that we know more about their life than they about 
ours. But the spiritual and intellectual potential of our people 
is certainly just as high. Can it be that we are short on 
educated people? 
  [Tasmagambetov] I understand that many people now have an 
opportunity to travel. And suddenly everybody began to 
appreciate the advantages of a market economy. But visual 
comparison is not the same as analysis; it is not a scientific 
approach to the problem. Therefore we need to both send our 
specialists there for internship and invite the most 
authoritative specialists of the world here. 
  [Question] The president certainly receives a lot of mail. 
And in that sea of mail surely there are some letters that 
deserve attention from the viewpoint of economic 
transformations. How does the president react to comments and 
proposals from the local level? 
  [Tasmagambetov] You are right. There is a sack of letters 
for 
the president every day. We have a letters department, which 
selects and sorts out correspondence. Nursultan Abishevich is 
indeed interested in letters whose authors contemplate ways of 
getting out of the crisis, problems of state importance, and 
offer competent economic advice. Some of them the president 
answers personally. All in all, however, there are all kinds of 
letters--with words of support, gratitude; there are 
congratulations on some or other occasion; and quite a few 
complaints. 
  [Question] It is hard to imagine Clinton or Mitterrand 
receiving complaints. We, however, have developed a habit over 
decades: If anything happens--write to the newspaper or the 
president. 
  [Tasmagambetov] Unfortunately, this is our reality. I cannot 
reproach people for turning to the president with complaints or 
requests at a time that is difficult in the socioeconomic sense. 
Because this is the way it has been for decades, when we were 
told that everything will be decided for you up there, at the 
top. But the real question as I understand it is whether you 
yourself have done everything possible to solve your own 
problems and whether the letter really should go all the way to 
the level of the president. I am convinced that when we achieve 
economic well-being, the number of letters to the president will 
not diminish. Perhaps only the character of the mail will change. 
  [Question] Do you ever argue with the president? 
  [Tasmagambetov] The president is a man open to a debate and 
polemics. He is willing to listen to his opponent's arguments, 
and if they sound convincing he will agree with the interlocutor. 
  [Question] Do you go on all trips with the president? 
  [Tasmagambetov] Almost all. I can even tell you the 
figure--how many "flight" hours we have accumulated over the 
past five months. It comes to more than 140 hours. 
  [Question] Much has already been written about the 
president's visit to the United States. It was clear from 
television reports that Nazarbayev and Clinton liked each other. 
Did this happen right away? 
  [Tasmagambetov] I think that much depended on the personal 
qualities of the two leaders. As to liking, it is only extended 
to equals. The Americans could not fail to appreciate 
Nazarbayev's sincere desire for democratic and economic reforms 
and his enormous conviction of their necessity; his ability to 
think in world categories, the desire to absorb the best there 
is in world practice, and to build a truly secular state taking 
into account historic traditions and multiethnic nature of his 
people. After all, as the hero of a Marcel Proust novel said: 
"...the world was not created just once; it is being created an 
indefinite number of times."

<F P=106> [Interview with Olzhas Suleymenov by Mikhail Ambartsumyan; </F>
date and place not given: "In International Kazakhstan People 
Have More Things in Common Than They Have Differences...."] 
  [Text] Almaty-- The results of the elections to the 
Supreme Council and the local representative authorities have 
still to be discussed and analyzed. It has still to be learned 
which political parties and public associations have won the 
greater trust of the electorate and why, and which candidates 
did not get elected to parliament and for what reasons. But it 
may be said even today that Kazakhstanis link their hopes for a 
better life with the new parliament. 
  His thoughts on the paths of development of sovereign 
Kazakhstan, the political situation, and the unfolding 
interethnic relations are shared today by People's Writer Olzhas 
Suleymenov, chairman of the People's Congress of Kazakhstan 
party. He was nominated for deputy of the Supreme Council on the 
official slate for Semipalatinsk Oblast and has, according to 
the preliminary data, been elected to the new parliament. 
  [Ambartsumyan] Olzhas Omarovich, the first question is 
connected with the "comrade" form of address. As distinct from 
many other representatives of your party, you have retained it. 
  [Suleymenov] It is what we acquired over many decades of 
dealings with one another. The word "comrade" retains a particle 
of the warmth of the soul of our fathers. And they are not to 
blame for the fact that our Great History of what is now the 
former Soviet Union bore within it the tragic element of the era 
of "victorious socialism." 
  We must see realistically what has happened to us and draw 
certain conclusions for the future, not wasting our acquired 
values, but, on the contrary, multiplying them. Genuine 
innovation does not cancel out all traditions but implies the 
development of the best. 
  We have been accustomed to beginning each new stage of 
history with a castigation of the past. This is why history as 
such has not been preserved in our consciousness. The "accursed 
past" the whole time. But there were in that past both joy and 
great discoveries also. And the main discovery, which has been 
called into question in recent years, unfortunately, is the 
friendship of the peoples. We should not give it away to anyone. 
To no independent orators and ranters, to no new careerist. 
  Internationalism is for this reason the firm foundation of 
our party's political program. The vital need for such a 
foundation is all the more obvious now, when some multinational 
republics are before our eyes becoming tragically mononational. 
In international Kazakhstan, people have more things in common 
than they have differences. 
  When I visit the Kazakh villages and see under what 
conditions people deprived of electricity, water, and telephones 
are dragging out a "survival" existence, it is clear that this 
problem will not be resolved by Kazakhs alone. The 
Russian-speaking population in the overpopulated industrial 
cities has its troubles also. The shortage of drinking water is 
growing in Mangistau Oblast, for example. Were the 
nuclear-powered desalination plant to be halted, the oblast 
would be left without water, heating, and light. And Mangistau 
means hundreds of thousands of people, oilfields, and a powerful 
industry. The main reason for the trouble is the exodus of 
specialists to Russia, to Ukraine. Why? Uncertainty as to the 
future. 
  [Ambartsumyan] The period of formation of the sovereign 
state 
is complex and contradictory. We are now hearing the opinions of 
many people, political scientists included, concerning the 
possibility of the introduction of dual citizenship in the 
republic. 
  [Suleymenov] The demand for second citizenship is the 
effect, 
and the cause is lack of confidence that the rights of certain 
categories of citizens in the republic will not be infringed. 
Language rights, primarily. If a person is persuaded that, on 
account of his ignorance of Kazakh, neither he nor his children 
have a future, he will, of course, look to where knowledge of 
Russian secures for him a normal life. The Constitution 
seemingly guarantees against persecution on a language basis, 
but in reality everything is far more complicated. And if in the 
name of the tranquillity of Kazakhstan and its 17 million 
citizens it is necessary to revise certain articles of the 
Constitution, this should, I believe, be done. The causes of a 
maturing conflict need to be removed. 
  It is impossible to imagine that in Kazakhstan over 50 
percent of the population will have other citizenship. This is 
like being on a passenger airliner. Half the people have 
parachutes and, should an accident occur, could save themselves, 
and the other half? It is rational and logical to have an 
airplane in a state of good repair and to improve its control in 
order that we might feel confident about the success of the 
flight. Then no one would require any parachute. 
  I want the Kazakh land to live in peace, tranquillity, and 
satiety. The Kazakhs to feel dignified. The Russians to have a 
better life here than in Russia, Ukrainians, better than in 
Ukraine, the Germans, better than in Germany, and so forth. And 
then no one would want to leave us. People would be proud of 
their Kazakh citizenship. "We are the people of 
Kazakhstan"--this is the motto of our party. 
  The Russian Kazakhstani has long been distinguished from the 
Russian. A different cast of consciousness. For example, my 
school comrade Aleksey Ugreninov, having married, left for 
Krasnodon. Six months later he wrote me a letter: "Before, when 
I lived in Kazakhstan, if I heard a dombra on the air, I would 
turn off the radio. Now, living in Krasnodon, hearing Kazakh 
music, I turn the volume up full and sit and weep. I greatly 
miss Kazakhstan, my homeland, where I was born and raised." 
  [Ambartsumyan] You have already partially touched on a very 
serious, difficult question--the two official languages. 
  [Suleymenov] We must be realists and recognize that the 
official language was for decades Russian. Kazakh--nominally the 
official language--is only just being pulled up to the level of 
Russian. And we know that there have been far from professional 
attempts to speed up this progress. But they have only 
discredited this mission itself. Thank God, the government has 
put right many zealous administrators, who had "endeavored" to 
translate clerical work into Kazakh immediately. And I saw how 
high-class doctors, totally at a loss, not knowing how to fill 
out the history of a disease in Kazakh, quit. Who suffered from 
this? Patients, the people. 
  The process of the formation of a second official language 
is 
very long, delicate, and complex. It cannot be accomplished by 
some edict of rayon, city, oblast, or republic authorities. Our 
language, like many others also, was sacrificed to the idea of 
the communist society. It was said that in the future there 
would be no national differences. And our fathers and 
grandfathers believed this. And the peoples are not to blame for 
the fact that so pronounced a linguistic disproportion took 
shape over 70 and more years. And it cannot be eliminated in two 
or three years. 
  For this reason we objectively have two official languages. 
One is traditional-official, the other is fledgling-official. If 
necessary, this should, I believe, be documented by the new 
parliament so that there should be no speculation or repressive 
measures and so that people who are the exponents of the Russian 
language should feel themselves to be full-blooded citizens of 
the republic and be at ease over their children's future. So 
that Kazakh should gain strength, ascend, and naturally 
penetrate all spheres. I have made my credo: "To elevate the 
steppe without belittling the mountains," my life's conviction. 
And only such a path of development of the Kazakh nation will be 
fruitful. 
  [Ambartsumyan] You have advanced the slogan: "From age-old 
dependence through independence to a recognition of 
interdependence." Could you, perhaps, decode this? 
  [Suleymenov] Last summer I proposed the incorporation in the 
program of our party, the NKK [People's Congress of Kazakhstan], 
the idea of a future confederation of the states of Eurasia. Its 
initial stage implies confederal relations between Kazakhstan 
and Russia. After this, I was rebuked in certain news media for 
not being a patriot of my country. But I love Kazakhstan, and I 
have no need to prove this, I think. 
  The main token of the difficult period of disintegration of 
the USSR has been the steep fall in production, constituting 50 
percent in some republics. The people are, consequently, 
becoming impoverished. We all feel and understand full well the 
need for the restoration of economic union, primarily with 
Russia, but within the framework of a confederal agreement. 
Sovereignty and independence here by no means imply one state's 
self-isolation from another. This is the same independence as 
that of the vivifying organs in each organism. All the best 
sober-minded forces of our republic, therefore, should be 
aspiring to the creation of an infrastructure of a future 
community of states that preserves the conditions for the full, 
free, and equal coexistence of sovereign countries in the 
example of the European economic confederation, which has 
already been created. 
  There is no escaping the fact that Kazakhstan is 
economically 
dependent on Russia and that Russia depends to a large extent on 
Kazakhstan also. All the Urals foundries without exception are 
unable to cope without Sokolovskaya-Sarbay ore and without our 
nonferrous metals, and 92 percent of native chromium is mined on 
Aktyubinsk land. And without Kazakhstan chromium, there is no 
Russian alloyed steel. We will, therefore, make every effort to 
preserve the common economic space and raise it to the higher 
level of confederal union. 
  [Ambartsumyan] But for this it is necessary to create the 
corresponding legislative base, which would enable the 
government to undertake important economic reforms. 
  [Suleymenov] I hope that the newly elected professional 
parliament will be capable of tackling this problem. 
  It is very important that society not split along national 
lines. The epidemic of national demarcation which has gripped 
certain republics of the former Union is penetrating Kazakhstan 
also. Unless we are able to resist this phenomenon, we will have 
no future. If, however, we recognize this danger in time and 
take the path of good sense and common sense, we can look 
forward to a splendid future. 
  If we avail ourselves in proprietary and solicitous fashion 
of the powerful resource base of Kazakhstan and the strong 
personnel potential (and this means thousands of engineers, 
highly skilled workers, specialists of agriculture, and 
scientists), we can achieve a great deal. And our party, the 
People's Congress of Kazakhstan, offers such a program. 
  [Ambartsumyan] Your party has a strong economic analysis 
group. Can we already speak of specific efforts to its credit? 
  [Suleymenov] Yes, highly skilled economists, historians, 
political scientists, psychologists, entrepreneurs, and 
representatives of religious beliefs are members of this group. 
Our comrades carefully analyze the phenomena occurring in the 
life of the republic, make forecasts, and generate specific 
recommendations, which are subsequently used in various party 
programs. And some of them are being implemented already. Not 
many readers know, for example, that Kazakhstan wool was going 
begging and that thousands of tonnes of it had piled up at the 
warehouses. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, it had been 
used for sewing the greatcoats of men of the Soviet Army. Now 
everyone in any way connected with this production had been left 
without a crust. And here our economists and entrepreneurs drew 
up a special program for use of the wool and set up the Klem 
corporation for the manufacture of carpets and felt. Equipment 
is being purchased in Turkey, and it will be distributed in the 
villages among the seamstresses free of charge. Good-quality and 
inexpensive carpets made from Kazakhstan wool will be made at 
home. We are thinking of increasing their manufacture in the 
future to 1 million items a year. The problems of work for the 
women in the countryside are being resolved in this way to some 
extent. 
  We would like to set up garment production at the home in 
the 
cities also. If the women receive all that they need, from the 
machines through the thread, there will be no need to build 
giant garment factories. But the people would obtain from the 
home workers, on the other hand, a particular quantity of 
high-quality merchandise produced on a competitive basis and 
under the aegis of this firm or the other. 
  In the past year alone, funds of our entrepreneurs purchased 
an Italian baby food plant and four bakeries. One of them, in 
Pavlodar, is already producing fresh bread. The others are 
located in Semipalatinsk and West Kazakhstan oblasts. Medicines 
and 1,000 tonnes of baby food have been purchased for $1 
million. Members of our party are channeling all this to needy 
people free of charge around the oblasts, in targeted fashion, 
down to the rayon component. 
  [Ambartsumyan] The Nevada-Semipalatinsk international 
antinuclear movement, of which you are a founder and the 
permanent president, is five years old now. You write frequently 
in the press and speak on television on this subject. 
Nonetheless, what are your strongest impressions in connection 
with the minor anniversary of this movement? 
  [Suleymenov] The most appalling thing was that the nuclear 
testing at the Semipalatinsk range was carried out in an 
atmosphere of eerie secrecy. Therefore, even the people living 
in this region did not know what was going on there. They were 
frightened when the earth shook beneath them (the force of the 
jolts reached 5) and were subjected to lethal radiation. 
  How many persons departed life for this reason, no one 
knows. 
Two diagnoses--tuberculosis or brucellosis--were made of the 
deceased. And only when our movement appeared were we able to 
make contact with some documents of that time. 
  Many people now know Karipbek Kuyukov of Semipalatinsk 
Oblast. He was born without arms, but became an artist. He draws 
with a brush and pencil clenched between his teeth. We went to 
Japan together and took part in protest demonstrations against 
the nuclear tests carried out in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I 
recall how he went into the square, where several thousand 
people were gathered, and said: "The gesture of our movement is 
an open palm, five continents against five test ranges. But I 
cannot make this gesture." And the whole square raised its hands 
with open palms. An unforgettable, stupendous feeling gripped 
all those present. 
  I am grateful to and have profound respect for the parents 
of 
Karipbek Kuyukov. They raised him, feeling by the hour his and 
their own misfortune. What a great feat of mother and father! He 
is now nearly 30 years old. And he is telling people of the 
world what misfortune nuclear weapons bring. 
  [Ambartsumyan] Concluding the interview, I have to ask you 
about your literary plans. Your numerous admirers want to see 
new poems and works. 
  [Suleymenov] At this time the fate of literature does not 
excite me as much as the fate of my readers. We writers are 
going into politics not because we lack economists or because 
there is none beside us to uphold people's rights, but because 
we feel the need for personal, direct participation in the 
formation of our state. 
  But I am working, nonetheless, and completing in draft form 
my new book, which will be entitled "One Thousand and One 
Words." I hope to be able to present it to my readers this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rust Zholamanov, manager of the Strategic </F>
Economic Development Department of the Strategic Research 
Institute under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, by 
Karlygash Yezhenova; place and date not given: "The Idea of the 
Organization of Free Economic Zones Came to Nothing"] 
  [Text] Among the recent official documents of the president 
of the republic is the edict "On Measures for Regulating the 
Activity of Free Economic Zones," which declared that the 
decisions of the former Supreme Soviet on the establishment of 
the Atyrauskaya, Eastern Kazakhstan, Karaganda, and 
Mangistauskaya free economic zones were invalid. The 
aforementioned document apparently can be viewed as the 
manifestation of a rather traditional trend among the leadership 
of the republic of late to significantly correct, and even to 
reduce entirely to nothing, ideas that were popular a year or 
two back, which were implemented at a declaratory level and as a 
rule not developed either juridically or practically. One of 
these is the idea of creating free economic zones as one of the 
basic factors in the formation of an export orientation for the 
republic. 
  The president's edict is commented on for PANORAMA by Rust 
Zholamanov, manager of the Strategic Economic Development 
Department of the Strategic Research Institute under the 
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  "Our institute recommended that the government adopt this 
measure, based on a number of factors. We will start with the 
fact that free economic zones presuppose a special tax policy, 
customs system, and principles of investment. None of this, as 
we know, was worked out. Moreover, the free economic zones in 
Kazakhstan encompass territories that are too big, and when you 
consider that there were nine of them in the republic and that 
they were formed on the basis of oblasts, as a result, the 
question goes beyond a strictly economic scope, taking on a 
political nuance--the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan could 
be threatened. It will be recalled that in its time the breakup 
of the USSR began precisely with the idea of regional economic 
accountability, which was implemented with great success by the 
Baltic republics. It was so great that they were the first to 
leave the Union system as a result. 
  "The free economic zones not only assume the existence of a 
definite technological infrastructure--international 
communications centers, hotel complexes, and transportation 
support--but they also must have commodity or technological 
potential for access to both foreign and domestic markets. 
  "And, finally, there is no strategy as such in Kazakhstan 
for 
the development of free economic zones. 
  "Our institute is now preparing a concept for a republic 
regional policy that develops a version of the mechanism for 
managing regions in general and an optimal formation of free 
economic zones in particular."

State Committee on Statistics: "Increasingly Fewer Job 
Vacancies"] 
  [Text] According to the assessment of the Ministry of 
Labor's employment department and the republic State Committee 
on Statistics, the situation in the labor market continued to 
deteriorate over the past few months. 
  Beginning last September the number of vacancies reported to 
the employment service by enterprises and organizations 
continued to decline steadily. Over the elapsed year, of 237,000 
persons who have applied to the employment centers, jobs were 
found for only 104,500. 
  The share of nonworking persons among all applicants looking 
for a job has increased. More than half of those who applied to 
the service last year are women; almost one half (49 percent) 
are young people between 16 and 29 years of age. The problem of 
their employment remains especially acute in Atyrau, Kzyl-Orda, 
East Kazakhstan, and Semipalatinsk Oblasts and the city of 
Leninsk. 
  As a result of the continuing decline in demand for labor 
force, the situation deteriorated even further in January: Of 
all persons who applied to the employment service, jobs were 
found for only one in four; in Atyrau Oblast, approximately one 
in 20; in Kzyl-Orda and North Kazakhstan Oblasts--one in nine to 
10; and in Aktyubinsk, Semipalatinsk, and Kustanay Oblasts--one 
in six to seven. Overall in January 7,300 unemployed were 
registered, 45 percent of them rural residents. 
  A new trend in the labor market should be noted: While last 
year the demand for labor systematically exceeded the number of 
unemployed (especially in the summer months), as of 1 February 
almost 43,000 persons had the status of unemployed. At the same 
time the number of job vacancies (those that enterprises and 
organizations reported to the employment service offices) 
amounted to 28,000, that is, one and a half times less. Another 
important point that should be kept in mind is the mismatch 
between the supply of and demand for labor by territories, 
population centers, and professional skill level. 
  Of the total number of unemployed, 16,000 (37.4 percent) 
were 
receiving unemployment benefits; the rest were covered by other 
forms of social protection. 
  The situation with respect to hidden unemployment continues 
to worsen as well. According to the oblast employment centers' 
data, 1,194 enterprises with a combined labor force of more than 
half a million people have halted production partially or fully 
or shifted to a shortened work schedule. More than 154,000 
persons are on compulsory leave.

Naumov: "Agro-Industrial Complex Is Deteriorating, but the Herd 
of Horses and Camels Is Growing"] 
  [Text] The Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] has 
released the preliminary results of financial-economic 
operations of the republic's agro-industrial complex. Over 1993 
the expected losses of sovkhozes, kolkhozes, and agricultural 
combines will amount to 129.6 million tenge, and the loss level 
is 4.8 percent, while a year earlier 119.7 million 
tenge--recalculated into national currency equivalency--was 
earned in profits and the profitability level was 7.4 percent. 
Also, 1,232 entities, or 49 percent of the total, will account 
for 422.4 million tenge in losses. 
  As we can see, almost one-half of public sector agricultural 
enterprises ended up bankrupt. The other half, which have 
survived the trials of a savage market, managed to cover only 
71.7 percent of the losses. 
  It would be useful to look at the financial side from the 
sectoral angle. Plant-growing, for instance, is overall 
profitable--17.5 percent. Moreover, all the main sectors are 
profitable: grain production--19 percent, potatoes--32 percent, 
field-grown vegetables--36 percent, and so on. At the same time, 
losses from sales of animal husbandry products amounted to 323.1 
million tenge; the loss level in milk production is 40 percent, 
wool--39 percent, and horned cattle--34 percent. 
  The costs of agricultural production increased 11-fold as 
compared to last year, which in turn resulted in increased 
production costs in plant-growing by a factor of nine to 25, and 
in animal husbandry by a factor of seven to 11. 
  The Goskomstat provides specific data on how much of what 
products was produced, and the comparison between 1993 and 1992 
figures. Grain and legumes were planted on 22 million hectares, 
or 348,000 hectares less than during the preceding year. The 
area sown decreased with respect to all crops, but an especially 
sharp cutback occurred with respect to millet--almost by half. 
The gross yield of grain in all categories of farms amounted to 
21.6 million tonnes, which is 8.1 million, or 27 percent, less 
compared to last year's yield. 
  Grain yield per hectare amounted on average to 9.7 quintals, 
which is one quarter lower than the levels reached in the past. 
The average yield of millet was only 4.4 quintals per hectare, 
and buckwheat--3.2 quintals. The shortfall in the production of 
these crops amounted to 216,000 and 99,000 tonnes, respectively. 
Production of potatoes and vegetables also declined in 1993--by 
9 percent and 15 percent, respectively. There are two 
reasons--smaller area sown and lower yields. The output of fruit 
and berries, as well as grapes, also declined as compared to 
last year--by 37 percent and 52 percent. The gross yield of 
sugar beet declined by almost one-quarter, and sunflower 
seed--by 12 percent. 
  As Goskomstat reports, the herd of horned cattle decreased 
as 
compared to last year by 5 percent, of swine--by 6 percent, and 
of sheep--by 1 percent. At the same time, the herd of horses 
increased by 4 percent, and of camels--by the same proportion. 
  At first glance, the herd of cattle decreased 
insignificantly. Translated into absolute figures, however, the 
numbers are impressive--hundreds of thousands of head. I will 
add myself that over the past three years the herd of horned 
cattle decreased by 596,200 head, swine--by 783,800 (that is, by 
one-quarter), and of sheep and goats--by 1,460,500. 
  The state of affairs in animal husbandry in different 
regions 
of the republic obviously is far from the same. For instance, 
the most perceptible decline in the size of horned cattle herd 
took place in Pavlodar Oblast--by 28 percent; in North 
Kazakhstan Oblast it decreased by 10 percent, and in Kustanay 
Oblast--by 7 percent. The herd of swine decreased by one-fifth 
in South Kazakhstan Oblast and almost one-third in Zhezkazgan 
Oblast; in a number of northern oblasts an active reduction of 
sheep and goats herd is underway. There are, however, 
encouraging examples as well. In southern and western oblasts, 
for instance, there was an increase in the size of horned cattle 
herd, in Akmolinsk and Karaganda Oblast--in swine, and in 
Atyrau, Mangistau, Kzyl-Orda and some other oblasts--in the 
number of sheep and goats. 
  According to Goskomstat reports, the reduction of herd in 
the 
public sectors, which began several years ago, continues. The 
hope that the private sector will make up for the losses did not 
fully materialize. Yes, there is an increase, but not as 
significant as expected. Take for instance horned cattle. Their 
number at private farms increased by 18,000, bringing the total 
to 87,000. This is less than 1 percent of their total number. 
  They say that under market laws, bankrupt enterprises cease 
to exist and are sold at auction. But there are just too many of 
them--1,232, almost one-half. Let us say some brave people will 
undertake this step. But who would want them, these economically 
insolvent agricultural enterprises? 
  This is the first thing. Second, sovkhozes and kolkhozes 
became bankrupt not by their own volition. There were, of 
course, unprofitable enterprises before--five, 10 years ago--but 
not this many! And the explanation that in the past the state 
subsidized them is not valid, because at the same time it 
underpaid the farms for their products, and rural workers--for 
their labor. 
  Third, over the past three years everything has been done to 
push agro-industrial complex enterprises into bankruptcy. Prices 
for industrial production grew much faster than for agricultural 
output. The cost of borrowing was unsustainable for sovkhozes 
and kolkhozes. On top of that, the state treasury ran out of 
money, delaying payments for grain and other products procured 
from the farms, which devalued the earnings even more. 
  It is clear today that the comprehensive solution for the 
problems of the agro-industrial complex that seemed possible 
turned out to be unacceptable. It is not so simple to disband 
unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and land cannot be 
distributed to farmers overnight. Plus, far from all will take 
it, and it is far from certain that those who will can get 
operate it profitably. Of more than 15,000 private farms, a good 
half, or maybe even more, also are bankrupt. Thousands of 
independent peasants do not know how to make the ends meet. 
  In short, just as the leadership of the Peasant Union and 
the 
Kolkhoz Council had predicted, the republic's agro-industrial 
complex has run aground, and solidly. And it is unlikely that we 
will be able to find a genius (domestic or foreign) capable of 
sorting everything out--when and what step to make, what to do 
today, what--the day after tomorrow. We will have to search for 
a solution together--politicians, economists, scientists, and 
peasants. 
  The number one priority by far should be the introduction of 
price parity on industrial and agricultural production, without 
which economic stabilization is impossible. Agricultural Academy 
scientists have developed a conceptual program of 
agro-industrial complex development, and it would be a waste not 
to use it. Academician M. Suleymenov, director of Imeni A.I. 
Barayeva Scientific-Research Institute of Grain Growing, 
Transportation Academician S. Plokhov, and others offer original 
ideas aimed at stable development of grain growing. All we need 
is to learn how to see and hear them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Morley Dupree, by Viktor Sutyagin; date and </F>
place not given: "We Like Working With the Kazakhstanis"] 
  [Text] As reported in a previous issue of 
KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA, last week Nursultan Nazarbayev, Sergey 
Tereshchenko, and other leaders of the republic met with Kenneth 
Derr, chairman of the board of directors of the Chevron 
Corporation, and discussed questions of cooperation in the 
sphere of the production and shipment of oil, including the 
activity of the Kazakhstani-American Tengizchevroil Enterprise, 
which, as the participants in the negotiations observed, has 
already produced the first positive results. Our correspondent 
met with Morley Dupree, manager of Tengizchevroil, and conducted 
with him the interview that is offered the reader today. 
  [Sutyagin] It is planned initially at the Tengiz deposit to 
produce 60,000 barrels of oil a day and subsequently to raise 
production to 700,000 barrels. The terms of the contract specify 
that Chevron shall in the first three years invest in the 
production of oil $1.5 billion, from which Kazakhstan is to 
receive $805 million net profit. Several vitally important 
facilities, powerful water-purification installations, and a 
boiler house have been and continue to be built, and engineering 
systems are being modernized in the oblast from Chevron's 
resources paid out as a bonus for the right to work on Atyrau 
land, and money has been allocated for the development of 
medicine. Mr. Dupree, negotiations were conducted for quite some 
time between the Soviet Union and, subsequently, sovereign 
Kazakhstan, and Chevron on the right to develop the Tengiz 
deposit. A contract was signed. I would like to know: What did 
you imagine work at Tengiz to be like and what have you 
encountered in practice? 
  [Dupree] I would like to affirm first of all that our 
expectations of finding in the oblast people who could work at 
our enterprise have been borne out. When we came here, two 
integrated production lines (IPL) were already operating, and 
the construction of IPL-3 had begun. But the point is that 
problems of the shipment of the oil to ports with terminals had 
not been resolved. Our primary task was to put IPL-1 on a sound 
footing, fully equip IPL-2 from the safety standpoint, and find 
a market for the oil that could be produced and refined by the 
gas-treatment plant. The construction of IPL-3, say, had from 
our viewpoint, therefore, to be suspended, inasmuch as it would 
at that time have been simply unprofitable to scatter our 
forces. The main problem now is selling the oil that has been 
produced. And we have been unable as yet, unfortunately, to 
solve this question completely. The point being that Kazakhstan 
lacks its own oil line, via which it could ship the oil to the 
international market. All this is giving rise to a whole chain 
of difficulties. 
  [Sutyagin] Would it not be better to refine the oil in situ, 
having engaged the capacity of Kazakhstan's refineries, Atyrau 
primarily? 
  [Dupree] I am forced to remind you that from the very 
outset, 
the contract was based on all the oil recovered at this deposit 
being exported and the entire revenue being obtained from 
exports of crude. It will not be refined in situ. Gas is another 
matter. There could here be various options, which we are 
beginning to study with the government of the republic. 
  [Sutyagin] And how do you view the idea of the construction 
of an oil pipeline from Iran with an outlet at the Red Sea? 
  [Dupree] There are two very important aspects in the 
construction of this pipeline, I believe. The economic aspect 
entailing enormous expenditure and not completely weighed 
benefits. And the political aspect: The oil pipeline would run 
over the territory of Iran. Who could guarantee that Iran would 
not tomorrow say "no" to the oil pipeline or ban the shipment of 
oil for some reason or other? 
  We are, meanwhile, on the other hand, studying more 
acceptable ways, from our viewpoint, of the shipment of the oil. 
These include, primarily, the Caspian Consortium project 
incorporating Kazakhstan, Russia, and Oman. A solution of the 
problem may be found also in the creation of transport routes to 
the Black Sea by Tengizchevroil directly. But I am not a 
utopian, and I realize that this problem will not be fully 
resolved in the coming three to five years. 
  [Sutyagin] But can the joint venture reach design capacity 
in 
this case? 
  [Dupree] This is not currently part of our tasks. The joint 
venture has many other unresolved problems. Everyone knows that 
Tengiz oil is unique in terms of its composition. I refer 
primarily to its very high hydrogen sulfide content. We are 
building a plant to treat the oil, therefore, and we would like 
in the very near future to have achieved a volume of production 
of 6-7 million tonnes a year--this is perfectly sufficient as 
yet. Such a quantity of oil cleansed of hydrogen sulfide and 
other harmful admixtures could be shipped across Russia via the 
Druzhba oil pipeline. 
  After we have laid our own transport line, for which, I 
hope, 
it is planned to produce 12 million tonnes a year, the planned 
production of 30 million tonnes will be achieved only by the 
year 2010. Fewer than 1 million tonnes have been produced and 
shipped thus far. We hope to obtain permission for the 
construction of our own oil pipeline. In this case, we would 
embark immediately on equipping IPL-3, in order that we might 
increase production, raising it to the maximum. 
  [Sutyagin] When the contract was being worked up, Chevron 
fired up the hopes of the inhabitants of the oblast with a 
promise to actively enlist in work at the joint venture the 
local population and to train personnel. How are these promises 
being fulfilled? 
  [Dupree] Training local personnel is a tradition for us. 
This 
may be confirmed in many countries in which Chevron operates. 
Thus, in Indonesia, for example, more than 6,000 employees work 
at the company. Only 100 of them are not local specialists. I 
believe that this was one of the reasons why our company was 
invited to Kazakhstan. Even at the initial stage, we are 
cooperating actively with local contractors, who are offering us 
various services. Of course, they do not in all respects as yet 
conform to the high demands that we make of our specialists and 
workers. But at the same time, we are constantly observing a 
trend toward an improvement in their work indicators. 
  [Sutyagin] I would like to hear about specific examples of 
cooperation with local outfits. 
  [Dupree] I could cite as an example our experience of work 
with the Tengizneftestroy Trust. This was one of the first 
companies with which we concluded an agreement. Very useful 
partner relations have taken shape between us. They provide us 
with various services connected with the buildup and development 
of the shift community of Tengiz and the production complex. The 
main difficulty in relations with local construction workers is 
the fact that they are not properly supplied technically and 
that they lack the technology that we need. But these problems 
are easily soluble via the organization or rather, the creation 
of every conceivable type of joint venture with foreign 
companies. Such ventures could be supplied with various Western 
equipment, and the same services as we usually obtain from 
Western companies could ultimately be expected of them. We 
ourselves are extremely interested in this, inasmuch as our 
contract with Kazakhstan is for 40 years. Seeking partners in 
the West is to our disadvantage. For this reason we are closely 
studying the potential of local enterprises. 
  [Sutyagin] Nonetheless, Turks, Hungarians, Slovaks, and 
representatives of a number of other states are today working on 
contract with Tengizchevroil on the rigging out and development 
of the field. Does it not seem to you that all the work that 
they are doing could be done by local personnel also? 
  [Dupree] The process of involving local organizations in the 
range of tasks being tackled by the joint venture is not 
something that can be accomplished overnight. Although even 
today we give the inhabitants of Zhylyoyskiy Rayon and Atyrau 
Oblast priority when we are looking for a contractor. It is 
among them that we begin the search for the specialists we need. 
And only if we do not find them here do we widen the sphere of 
the search--to the level of the region, all of Kazakhstan, and 
then the CIS. Only having convinced ourselves that the search 
has been unsuccessful do we turn to our old partners in other 
countries. The basis, however, for the conclusion of a contract 
are the good quality of the work performed for us, observance of 
the deadlines specified by the contract, and a reasonable price. 
It is my personal opinion, incidentally, that Kazakhstan has an 
appreciable advantage over other countries in which we have 
worked. There is here a wealth of experience in oil production: 
The first well produced a gusher of oil in Atyrau Oblast in 
1911. You have many high-class specialists, and practically all 
residents of the area where we are located are familiar with the 
process of oil and gas production. Training them is not an 
issue. It is simply necessary to familiarize them with our 
standards of the organization of labor, and with Chevron they 
are at the level of the world's highest. 
  [Sutyagin] Our readers would be interested in learning, I 
believe, how the everyday life of employees of the joint venture 
who have come from America and Europe to the difficult semi-arid 
climatic conditions has been established. What difficulties have 
you encountered, and how are you resolving them? 
  [Dupree] Chevron specialists work in Africa and Indonesia 
and 
other countries with no less difficult a climate and a very 
unstable political atmosphere at times. Everyone who came here, 
therefore, knew that it would not be easy. And all day-to-day 
questions are gradually being solved: The Hungarian construction 
workers have built quite comfortable accommodations, and we have 
resolved transport problems, having purchased automobiles for a 
number of employees, and have ourselves organized flights from 
Atyrau to Europe. 
  The most painful problem is that of food. Although there are 
several pretty good restaurants, we cannot always find 
good-quality food in the oblast. But we are attempting to engage 
local resources as much as possible--we are concluding contracts 
for supplies of agricultural produce, purchasing what we can. We 
are trying to support our suppliers materially here and are 
supplying them with hardware and equipment. On just one 
condition--the quality of the food must be high. Unfortunately, 
we sometimes encounter amazing situations, which could, in my 
view, be avoided. Thus, we concluded a contract with the Atyrau 
poultry factory for the supply of broilers. We looked them 
over--pretty good quality. We started to talk about money, 
offering any form of payment in any currency. But they told us: 
We do not need money; supply us with gas for heating. According 
to the terms of the contract, however, we are not entitled to 
dispose of the gas--it is at the disposal of the government of 
the republic. We tried to explain: Buy the gas for foreign 
currency. The factory management is sticking to its guns. The 
contract is, naturally, in jeopardy, and we will be forced, 
consequently, to purchase the broilers elsewhere. 
  [Sutyagin] It is no secret that many people are trying to 
land jobs at the joint venture, where remuneration is higher 
than at Kazakhstan's enterprises. Especially since earnings are 
in dollars. Will the system of remuneration change? 
  [Dupree] We try to motivate people as much as possible. In 
principle, it is all the same to us in what currency wages are 
paid. We could have a mixed pay in two currencies, we could pay 
merely in tenge. But with the continuing inflationary processes, 
which have intensified as of late, payments merely in tenge 
could only increase the inflation and partially "eat up" the 
wages before they are spent, even. We will continue, therefore, 
to try to protect our employees as much as possible, stimulating 
their good work in every way possible. Especially since there is 
something to pay for. We are observing how the competence of the 
local personnel is increasing and their interest in the affairs 
of the venture is growing literally before our eyes. We like 
working with Kazakhstanis.

<F P=106> [Article by Umar Ongov, city of Tashkent, under the rubric </F>
"The Narcotics Business": "Uzbekistan: A Narcotics Window to 
Europe?"] 
  [Text] The problem of drug addiction has no borders. It has 
gone beyond the confines of individual regions and can no longer 
be considered one of the social problems or forms of crime 
outside the general economic and political context. The 
narcotics business is actively invading the sphere of 
international politics and world economics as a dominant factor. 
That is the opinion of the International Narcotics Control 
Committee expressed in the report of the director of the 
regional representation of the UN program UNDKP [expansion 
unknown], Arkadius Meydzhik. In a most direct way it affects 
Uzbekistan, which at this time is one of the major consumer 
states and transit zones through which narcotic substances are 
transferred from Asia to Europe. 
  Despite the fact that, according to official data, only 
4,400 
drug addicts and 3,700 people potentially willing to use a drug 
are registered in Uzbekistan. But the percentage of narcotic 
substance users is much greater than the state statistics. 
Incidentally, even governmental circles acknowledge this. 
  Unfortunately, UNDKP representatives do not have complete 
information. Thus, according to Mr. Meydzhik, a characteristic 
feature of some law enforcement organizations of Uzbekistan is 
the unjustified top secrecy of the information they have. As a 
result, UNDKP is forced to work with official statistics which, 
alas, too often pass off wishes as fact. 
  At the same time, however, according to a sociological 
survey 
by independent experts and from sources close to law enforcement 
services, 1 out of every 100 of the republic's residents may be 
classified as persons who have tried narcotics at least once. 
The percentage of those who regularly use these drugs is also 
high. Drug use is most widespread among public transport 
drivers, workers, college students, and vocational-technical 
school students. 
  Cannabis is one of the main types of narcotics found in 
Uzbekistan. Moreover, in some corners of the republic the use of 
opium, especially its derivative koknar, is quite widespread. 
Undoubtedly, the government of Uzbekistan is taking concrete 
steps to resolve the problem, in particular regularly conducting 
"Black Poppy" operations to destroy plantings of opium poppies 
and developing programs to preserve industrial fields of hemp. 
But the development and application of new criminal procedure 
laws as well as ones now in operation which do not yet satisfy 
the existing convention are needed. Contemporary information 
systems and many other things must be introduced. And most 
importantly, consolidation of all interested organizations is 
needed rather than secrecy.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of </F>
the mass media (SMI) committee of the State Duma, by Maxim 
Shabalin, Moscow, under the "At First Hand" rubric; date not 
given: "The Audience Should Know"] 
  [Text] [Poltoranin] Today's campaign against the State Duma 
in the mass media is nothing other than an echo of the former 
war between the first and fourth branch of power that was waged 
in the summer and autumn of last year. I think that in order to 
overcome this situation, we have tactical and strategic steps in 
reserve. I would relate to the tactical the fact that we first 
of all need a press center that feeds information to all of our 
newspapers and to our television. 
  As for the strategic directions, they, in my view, are 
these: 
Of course, you cannot take the mass media by assault and frontal 
attacks. The previous Supreme Soviet tried to do this, but this 
attempt was not crowned with success. The powerful structures 
also did not succeed in tearing off their own "Parliamentary 
Hour" piece by piece. This tactic is futile. 
  It is nonsense that the government--one of the branches of 
power--today monopolizes all state mass media as an instrument 
of public control over this very power. Therefore, we must 
correct the condition legislatively and create the kind of 
situation where the mass media works objectively, and no one 
interferes with it. 
  We intend tomorrow to submit the draft of a federal law for 
review by the State Duma concerning the procedure for 
elucidating in the state mass media the activity of the higher 
organs of authority of the Russian Federation. 
  [Shabalin] The problems about which you are talking are 
associated directly with articles of the law adopted by the 
Supreme Soviet, which, however, the president suspended.... 
  [Poltoranin] The president suspended a lot of laws and many 
legislative acts. Committees (including ours also) will conduct 
an inventory of everything that has been suspended and will 
submit the question for Duma review. The mass media is an 
important force, the fourth branch of power, and we must do 
everything so that the press should cooperate with the State 
Duma. As for specific proposals and the adoption of decisions 
about renewing the transmission of "600 Seconds," etc.--these 
are not functions of the Duma. There is a separation of powers 
according to the new Constitution, there is a law on the mass 
media, and there are such structures as, for example, the 
television company "Sankt-Peterburg--Channel 5." There are also 
such substructures as "600 Seconds." This is their business, and 
not that of the State Duma: to produce or not to produce. Our 
business is to create the kind of law so that there would be no 
barriers for one or another television program or for articles 
in newspapers. 
  [Shabalin] But in contrast to the former Supreme Soviet, the 
Federal Assembly, from a political standpoint, is quite 
heterogeneous. In accordance with your draft laws, will access 
to the airwaves be offered to all factions? 
  [Poltoranin] Unquestionably, this will be reflected in the 
draft law on the procedure for elucidating the work of the 
higher organs of authority in the state mass media. I do not 
think that the resumption of the "Parliamentary Hour" will 
aggravate the situation. On the other hand, conducting this 
program in the form in which it came out has no future. I assure 
you: By no means everyone watched this "Parliamentary Hour." 
Therefore, it is necessary for us to acquire air time to 
illuminate the work of the State Duma, both on the first and 
second Ostankino channels, and on the St. Petersburg channel, 
and, it is quite natural, on the channels of the 80 regional 
television companies that today live on the federal budget. This 
is the objective. The entire population of Russia must be 
informed of our work.

<F P=106> [Remarks of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma </F>
committee for CIS matters, and cochairman of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, recorded from a telephone conversation 
by Maxim Shabalin, under the "At First Hand" rubric; date not 
given: "Do Not Play With Matches"] 
  [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], 
together with the Women of Russia faction, was the initiator of 
the adoption of the Memorandum of Accord. I had occasion several 
times at the council of the Duma to defend the principle of pact 
voting. For the first time from the beginning of work of the new 
parliament, I had a reason to tell the voters: Everything 
possible was done not to repeat the nightmare of the recent 
past, and so that the dead do not grasp for the legs of the 
living. Manifestos, memoranda, declarations--these are not 
documents of direct action. But there are quite a few examples 
in the history of many states about what kind of role the 
declaration or nondeclaration of such documents can play. I will 
risk saying that the resolutions adopted by the Duma really 
provide an opportunity for accord. It, of course, can be missed 
due to a misunderstanding or malicious intent. Unfortunately, 
the behavior of some of our natural allies--deputies from 
Russia's Choice and the Yavlinskiy bloc--is a reason to suspect 
at least elements of such intent in their attitude toward the 
Memorandum. 
  Very much depends now on the mass media, inasmuch as it is 
it 
that brings the essence of one or another decision of the 
legislative or executive authority to the people. If all 
commentaries reduce the usefulness of the adopted Memorandum to 
zero, then its value really will prove to be no more than the 
value of the paper it is written on. The search for accord is 
not a very simple matter, but its necessity should be recognized. 
  The fighting fervor of the antagonistic parties, which once 
almost brought Russia to the brink of a civil war, remains. 
There is evidence of attempts by individual deputies to 
undermine the adoption and to dodge it at the last moment. But 
if the president, nonetheless, intends to observe the 
Constitution and not to violate the authority of the Duma, then 
the people who are under investigation in Lefortovo will be 
amnestied. How they behave in the future depends on us. 
Orientation on a continuation of the confrontation and on a 
vendetta will not lead to anything, especially when the 
character of the persons involved in the dispute from both sides 
is taken into account--of the president, of Khasbulatov, and of 
Rutskoy. The characters are not easy to get along with--I would 
say, they are Russians. 
  I am convinced that there are no prisons that hold you 
forever. It is impossible for the trial of the participants in 
the October events not to turn into a political trial. An 
example of such a trial is the GKChP [State Committee for the 
State of the Emergency] affair, to which there is no visible end 
without an amnesty. The more quickly it takes place, the fewer 
reasons there will be for being concerned about the fate of 
future elections--both local and presidential. I am confident 
that many alleged political authorities will waver considerably 
after an amnesty. We, for example, do not intend to fight for 
Rutskoy's electorate, but such a fight is in prospect for 
Vladimir Volfovich. 
  In addition, I do not think that an investigation into the 
October events is really advantageous to the current executive 
authority, inasmuch as any investigation inevitably will get 
stuck on Edict No. 1400, which the author himself recognized as 
unconstitutional. I want to close this page, and not only I. 
Individuals continue to threaten a civil war, but I would ask 
them to calm down and to leave the matches alone.

<F P=106> [ Unattributed article: "Russian President's Life Exposed to </F>
Danger"] 
  [Text] On 7 December of last year, an aircraft carrying 
Boris Yeltsin ended up outside radar control. The life of the 
president was exposed to danger, because the power supply in the 
air traffic control center in Rostov-na-Donu (the "Strela" 
center) was suddenly turned off "for nonpayment of its electric 
bill." 
  The Strela center was turned off at the very moment when, in 
addition to the president's aircraft, there was the largest 
number of Il's, Tu's, and Western Boeings in the air space of 
the Southern region. 
  "This was the first incident in the history of world civil 
aviation when a dangerous situation of such a scale was created 
in fact not as a result of an accident, but by the absolutely 
deliberate actions of a person," notes an observer. "Meanwhile, 
specialists know that even less dangerous disruptions in air 
traffic can lead to a fatal disaster" 
  In revealing the extremely alarming situation in air 
transport, the observer reports that within two days after the 
"presidential" incident, the electricity from the air traffic 
control center in Rostov was cut off once again. This time, 
Sergey Shakhray, a recent deputy prime minister and now a member 
of the Security Council of Russia, was in one of the aircraft 
that ended up in the "dead zone."

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Lifshits: "Right Turn Through the Left </F>
Shoulder"] 
  [Text] It is not enough to say that the process is 
under way--it has begun to tear along. The process, we recall 
Mikhail Sergeyevich once again, of the discovery of consensus. 
Consensus between the radical-right nomenklatura-bourgeois 
groupings victorious in December. For whoever did not understand 
this, even having listened to President Yeltsin's report to 
parliament, all the discoveries will be to come. It will very 
shortly be revealed that the new Kremlin ideology of the 
"national cause" and the anticrisis policy of the government 
will successfully combine the white Bolshevism of Russia's 
Choice and the black Bolshevism of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia], and the upshot will be something suspiciously 
Zyuganovian. 
  The odious super-radicals are cut off here as yet--Gaydar 
has 
quit the government, Zhirinovskiy has not yet arrived, and 
Chernomyrdin is coping by himself. But the conservative projects 
going back to the summer-fall initiatives of Oleg Lobov 
and--horrors!--Khasbulatov's leadership of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Russian Federation: the inflationary financing of "priority" 
state industry, the self-organization of apparatus-bureaucratic 
capital into "financial and industrial groups," the renunciation 
of privatization romanticism, and so forth, have been tacitly 
restored. The political realities of Russia, on the other hand, 
are evoking the specters not only of "Ukrainianization" or the 
"Belarusian option" but of Central Asian dictatorships also. 
  Many people certainly already understand that the LDPR did 
not support the "democratic" constitution fortuitously. It is 
not only a question of the keen political sense of Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy. Today's "strong of this world," having adopted the 
oligarchic precept: "The strong determine progress by exploiting 
the weak," are already quite openly seeking an acceptable leader 
figure. This figure began to show in outline, it would seem, in 
the person of the main favorite on 12 December--in quite 
grotesque fashion as yet, but give it time! Practice makes 
perfect. 
  Even more important is the fact that the LDPR, which was the 
mirror reflection in the election campaign of the anti-Gorbachev 
tactics of Democratic Russia, is oriented toward the 
national-fundamentalist circles of that same nomenklatura 
bourgeoisie whose comprador wing is the social client of 
Russia's Choice. While deliberating a great deal on how Vladimir 
Volfovich managed to attract the votes of 14 million Russians 
(which is not difficult in our times for a man with his 
inclinations), commentators are omitting a far more serious 
question: How did this person attract multimillion financial 
flows, that is, win the support of part of the ruling elite? 
  The other December winner, the Communist Party of the 
Russian 
Federation, is essentially from that same crowd. Having become 
ideologically loosened since 1987, having joined up with 
bureaucratic business, and having lost direct access to the 
managerial function, the Communist Party, as a whole, ceased to 
be a totalitarian structure--this was the undoubted achievement 
of April-85 and August-91. But, having ceased to be 
totalitarian, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has 
moved not to the left but to the right flank of the political 
spectrum. The program reference points of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation are based on the same conservative 
populism and fundamentalist statism as of the LDPR. True, 
Zyuganov's leadership is concerned more for respectability and 
is of a traditionalist frame of mind, furthermore--whence the 
commitment to the Soviet form of authoritarian rule and 
criticism of the constitution. As far, however, as left-wing 
phrase-mongering, of a social-protection motif particularly, is 
concerned, nowhere is state paternalism the prerogative of 
forces of the left, being the alpha and omega of any 
populism--from Le Pen through Turkes (about the NSDAP we will 
say nothing). Today's Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, for example, 
are demanding an end to privatization and the concentration of 
all property in the hands of an independent state, but this does 
not make them people of the left. 
  There is no effective alternative to 
right-wing-authoritarian 
hegemony in the Federal Assembly. Sergey Shakhray's PRES [Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord] has demonstrated the quite lifeless 
launch of Civic Union-2. It is possible that Shakhray's attempt 
to consolidate big national capital, state capital particularly, 
will prove more successful thanks to the chord which is being 
struck between the industrialists and the regional 
administrators, but there is no guarantee that the PRES will not 
be supplanted in its parliamentary niche by that same Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation or by New Regional Policy, which 
has appeared like a bolt from the blue. 
  The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc has created for itself 
the 
image of a constructive democratic alternative to Gaydar, 
Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy put together and has partially 
managed to attract the sympathies of the electorate committed to 
liberalism and social democracy. But YABLoko has not fallen far 
from Russia's Choice, despite the strong intellectual efforts of 
Yavlinskiy, who has been forced to concoct differences. The 
"liberal-legal" concept of essentially that same model of 
capitalization is formulated speculatively, which is partially 
connected with the absence in YABLoko of the criminal resolve 
typical of the leadership of Russia's Choice. In fact, YABLoko 
assigns itself the role of respectable generator of liberal 
ideas, which will someday, "at a new historical stage," be 
claimed in a reformed Russia. The ascent to this stage still has 
to be made, it is true.... 
  So "accursed friends" were the winners in December. A kind 
of 
symbol of this community was the election of the right-wing 
populist Nevzorov in an elite district of Petersburg--"an area 
of hard-currency taverns and privatized apartments." The clashes 
between Russia's Choice and the LDPR and the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation are a prepared version of the conflict of 
the "mafia against the bureaucracy" known since Mussolini's 
times. The political struggle of the Gaydarites and the 
Zyuganovites and Zhirinovskiyites has been brought about by the 
differences in the interests of comprador-speculative capital, 
the administrators of the state economy, and nationalistically 
oriented business. Whence the different ideological 
slogans--liberalism, chauvinism, communism--whence the appeal to 
different social strata in the search for mass support, whence 
the success of the demagogy: "Either us or... (insert as 
required)." The common denominator of the ruling oligarchy 
remains, however, authoritarian elitism and statism and reliance 
on state power as the instrument of compulsory capitalization. 
  By and large, the claret-colored shadow of fascization looms 
over the country for the uncontested struggle of the right 
against the extreme right is being played out in the Russian 
political space. The niche of the forces of the left is empty, 
and wage labor and the independent economy have been cut off 
from actual politics--this is the main result of the menacing 
totalitarian degeneration. 
  To blame for the failure of the left (the real left!) is 
primarily the left itself. In an excruciating search for a path, 
the Social Democratic Party of Russia has split into several 
groupings. Thanks to its leader, Rutskoy's NPSR [Free Russia 
People's Party] has sunk to the bottom. Having concluded a 
"pink-beige" alliance with the moderate nationalists, Cossacks, 
and oil industrialists, the Socialist Workers Party allowed 
itself to be dragged into the plan for a "social-patriotic 
alliance" struck up on the basis of the conservative Federation 
of Commodity Producers and the personal interests of Yuriy 
Skokov. The Socialist Workers Party has thereby excluded itself 
from the movement of the left, virtually, which is not all that 
surprising, considering its genetic kinship with the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation. Running in majority-system 
constituencies, certain representatives of forces of the left 
frequently ended up on the Communist Party slate, which 
complicates the situation even further. 
  In short, the formation of a center left, in which social 
democracy can alone exist, has to be started almost "from 
scratch." This is difficult, but there is the hope that society 
will soon understand how dangerous it is to fly on one wing. And 
the left itself, it has to be thought, will bestir itself. There 
are already some signs of revitalization on this flank, 
incidentally. 
  The defeat of Civic Union and almost all the trade union 
bosses stirred among the leaders of the "traditional" trade 
union movement interest in the plan for a Labor Party, which is 
being proposed to them by the social democrats of the Social 
Democratic Party of Russia, the Free Russia People's Party, and 
the Party of Labor, which has for three years served politically 
the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions. The cornerstone of the 
plan is a strong, typically Laborite coupling of 
left-wing-democratic organizations and social civic 
associations--the "traditional," "free," and "corporate" unions, 
the STK movement, self-managing associations, consumer unions, 
civil rights organizations, and so forth. 
  In the event of realization of this plan, the Russian 
Laborites would be a political force potentially capable of 
defending the formation of the civil society and of 
strengthening and stimulating its structures. This ensues 
naturally from their main function--defense of the socioeconomic 
rights of the citizens against the background of the essentially 
anti-civic position of the principal political subjects of 
contemporary Russia. Economic democracy and self-government, the 
employees' share in profits and ownership, reform of the system 
of social insurance and taxation, the social responsibility of 
enterprise and state administration, stimulation of all forms of 
civic self-organization on a firm material and legal 
foundation--a movement with such a program "package" could 
obviously lay claim to the "pink" niche, which stands empty in 
today's political spectrum, and constitute a real democratic 
alternative to the "claret-colored" Stalinists and the in fact 
perfectly "white" Zyuganovites. 
  The consolidation of the antiauthoritarian and antifascist 
movement along the lines of the National Front in France in the 
1930's--the sole historical example of a mass democratic 
movement stopping fascism--is possible on a Laborite basis. It 
is hard to say what would result from Russian Laborites, but the 
citizens are required to forestall a "chief"--they have no 
worthier option.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergei Skvortsov, secretary-coordinator of </F>
the CPSU Central Committee, by MN correspondent Dmitry Pushkar: 
"The Communist Party Hasn't Fallen to Pieces Yet"; first 
paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The niche which was once occupied by Viktor Anpilov, 
leader of the "Moscow Labour" movement who has been arrested, 
was not empty for long. On February 10 in Moscow, revolutionary 
romantics conducted a protest against the declining standard of 
living. The small crowd was led into battle by the zealous 
promoter of the people's wellbeing, the CPSU. Despite all 
metamorphoses the CPSU retains its former goal, that of building 
communism. Sergei Skvortsov, one of the few legal leaders of the 
party, explained to an MN correspondent, how he would do this. 
  The CPSU, relieved of the heavy burden of power, 
sanatoriums, 
armoured limousines, game reserves and secret laboratories for 
forging documents and deprived of Article 6 of the Constitution, 
has shrunk to the size of an ordinary party. Its leaders 
critically appraise the numerical strength of its Russian 
organization at 20,000 roughly as many as the Russian 
Social-Democratic Labour Party had in 1917. Some time ago the 
central committee even allowed "dual citizenship" so that a CPSU 
member could be also a member of other parties, but now the 
rules have been made stricter. 
  The highest official of the CPSU Central Committee, 
secretary-coordinator Sergei Skvortsov, is a short, balding 
bespectacled man in his early forties. He completed a 
postgraduate course as an economist and served in the army as a 
deputy political instructor in a construction battalion. He 
lives in the Moscow Region. Besides being responsible for the 
party's leadership, he fulfills the role of chairman of the 
movement in defence of Russian history (meaning Lenin). He is 
also editor of the "People's Newspaper". 
  The CPSU is not registered and has no office nor address. 
The 
composition of its secretariat and the central committee is a 
secret. 
<H5>  Action </H5>
  "On February 10 the party conducted a day of protest against 
declining living standards", says Sergei Skvortsov. "Several 
groups set up an interregional strike committee which I also 
joined. We do not plan to organize a general strike which would 
grow into an armed uprising, as was the case in 1905. We advance 
economic and general democratic demands: a price freeze on 
essential goods, the indexation of the minimal earnings to the 
subsistence level, compensation for a delay in paying wages at 
half of one percent a day, and a prohibition on the closing of 
enterprises. We also demand the indexation of deposits in the 
Savings Bank in keeping with the rising prices. Our only 
political demand is for free democratic elections. Our party has 
initiated the boycotting of elections. The action of February 10 
was in fact the first step in building a mass people's movement. 
The way out of an economic crisis is strict regulation by the 
state, in any case, the strengthening of the state's role. There 
is no other fitting model, you see, besides the Marxist one". 
  MN: Why do you laugh when you say "Marxist"? 
  S.: Because the word has been abused too much by 
many, including our activists. 
<H5>  Property </H5>
  MN: What is your party's attitude to ownership of the 
means of production? 
  S.: There is consensus among almost all communist 
parties. We base ourselves on the classic Marxist approach that 
the state should have the commanding positions, while private 
property is eradicated as it gradually becomes socially 
unnecessary. 
  MN: Ownership of land? 
  S.: It should not exist. It is not an absolute 
dogma, but the absence of private property is necessary in our 
country, because in the event of free purchase and sale of land 
it does not get into the hands of those who cultivate it. The 
law on land was built for the area around Moscow in order to 
secure plots of land for country houses. 
  MN: What is your attitude on the property of the CPSU? 
Do you consider yourselves its heirs? 
  S.: The succession is direct. We have elected a 
new leadership of the party that existed. The number of new 
members who joined the CPSU after it was reinstated is a mere 
hundred or two. We practically have the same people. In legal 
terms we are claimants to the property. We may probably raise 
the question of property if a new political situation arises, 
but we shall demand not the return of the entire property but 
only of what is necessary for political activity. 
<H5>  Cornerstones </H5>
  MN: Dictatorship of the proletariat? 
  S.: The concept of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat was considered to be a corner-stone of the Marxist 
theory. Those who speak about it now mean the working class. But 
this part of society is no longer in the majority. The leading 
role in society should be played by the workers of manual and 
mental labour, those who create not only material, but also, to 
use a Marxist term, spiritual benefits. But this must not 
necessarily be a dictatorship as it was understood before. 
  MN: Class struggle? 
  S.: Class struggle remains the way we understand 
it. Today we may be allies, but the situation may change 
tomorrow and we may have neutral relations or become opponents. 
  MN: The attitude to religion? 
  S.: According to our rules we may have believers 
in our ranks. We believe, generally speaking, that Marxist 
philosophy by which we are guided is atheistic, but do not 
intend to force this viewpoint on anyone, including the members 
of our party. This principle is now characteristic of almost all 
communist parties, at least of those which are not in power. 
<H5>  The Soviet Union </H5>
  MN: What is your position on the national question? 
  S.: To reinstitute guberniyas is an entirely 
unrealistic aim connected with doing obvious violence to 
peoples. At the same time we naturally stand for the 
reestablishment of the Soviet Union. We believe that it can be 
done by means of adopting by the legislative body of Russia of a 
decision on the restoration of the operation of the USSR 
Constitution on the territory of the Russian Federation. Several 
republics can practically immediately follow this way. 
<H5>  The Final Goal Is To Work for Idlers </H5>
  MN: It follows from the name of your party that you are 
fighting to build communism. Do you think that "the next 
generation of Soviet people" will live under communism? 
  S.: I cannot make categorical forecasts. I myself 
belong to a rather young generation, but as for the next 
generation... No, there won't be communism in 50 years from now, 
so you are right. 
  MN: What will communism be like? 
  S.: People will be engaged in some kind of 
creative work, though there may be some left who will want to 
till soil because they may find it interesting, or for the sake 
of relaxation. At the initial stage a certain minimum of life's 
benefits will be granted to all. At this stage some additional 
benefits will be offered to people who have made the greatest 
contribution to society's development. Further on, the range of 
these benefits will evidently decrease because the most 
important element is the development of a new man. I consider 
the desire to have two or three Mercedes cars a deviation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities </F>
and regional policy, member of the Government of the Russian 
Federation Presidium, and deputy of the State Duma, and Emil 
Pain, leader of the group for nationality policy of the 
Presidential Council, by Tamara Zamyatina, observer of 
ITAR-TASS, specially for SEGODNYA; place and date not given: 
"Federalism or Disintegration--There Is No Other Way"] 
  [Text] The signing of the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan has spotlighted more clearly in the public 
consciousness the polarization of views on the conversion of the 
country from a unitary into a truly federative state. The paths 
of the formation of federalism in Russia were reflected in the 
president's report which Boris Yeltsin delivered to parliament. 
Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities and regional policy, 
member of the Government of the Russian Federation Presidium, 
and deputy of the State Duma, and Emil Pain, leader of the group 
for nationality policy of the Presidential Council, an interview 
with whom we publish today, took part in the preparation of one 
of its sections. 
  [Zamyatina] The treaty between Russia and Tatarstan has set 
"at odds" two positions on the further formation of the 
Federation. Is it a step forward and a renunciation of unitary 
approaches or is it, as Sergey Baburin declares, a weakening of 
the positions of the center? Your viewpoints, gentlemen? 
  [Pain] My viewpoint is that all regions should in principle 
have equal rights, but they have different conditions for their 
realization. It is for this reason that they will to a 
dissimilar extent delegate authority to the center, and this 
means that treaty relations are in the future inevitable with 
all regions. In this sense I welcome the agreement with Tataria 
as the first swallow of such treaty relations. 
  [Zamyatina] That is, you believe that bilateral treaties are 
needed with each component of the Federation? 
  [Shakhray] There is a legal and economic possibility of the 
conclusion of treaties similar to that with Tataria with each 
component of the Russian Federation. And this is not Shakhray's 
opinion. This is Article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, clause 3 of which says that the terms of reference 
shall be delineated "by this constitution and the Federal and 
other treaties." 
  A government program and state approach are needed on this 
issue. In addition, a federal law on the principles of the 
delineation of terms of reference and authority is needed 
urgently to ensure that the bilateral treaties not look like 
backstage bargaining. 
  As far as Tataria is concerned, its leadership has earned 
the 
title of "locomotive" of federal relations. 
  Whoever is prepared to negotiate this path and to 
scrupulously prepare a similar treaty--certainly, the next in 
line. I believe that a treaty will be signed with Kaliningrad 
Oblast. This, again, is not just my desire, it is the position 
of the president and the Government of the Russian Federation. 
  [Zamyatina] In speaking of treaty relations, you have 
cautiously sidestepped the problem of the Chechen Republic. Is 
it possible to achieve a similar agreement with Chechnya? 
  [Shakhray] The example of Tataria has shown that neither 
unilateral declarations nor one-sided pressure nor rulings of 
the Constitutional Court work in the relations of the center and 
components of the Federation. Only the voluntary delegation of 
authority is acceptable. The treaty with Tataria formulated the 
sole possible procedure of the removal of the contradictions 
between constitutions of the republics and the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation. In respect to the Chechen Republic not 
the same text but the procedure of the treaty with Tataria is 
applicable, I believe. 
  [Pain] We both believe that a million Russian citizens, 
inhabitants of Chechnya, are today hostages to separatist-minded 
politicians, have been deprived of protection on the part of the 
Russian Constitution, and are living under conditions of growing 
crime, and thousands of families have already been forced to 
leave their native parts. This situation is, naturally, 
intolerable. 
  But there is a solution only on a strictly legal basis. 
Russia must strive for democratic elections in Chechnya with the 
participation of all ethnic, social, and political groups of 
society.... 
  [Shakhray] ...opposition included. 
  [Pain] But negotiations between the federal authorities and 
the authorities of Chechnya on a delineation of power are now 
possible and necessary also. 
  [Shakhray] Debate here on the subject of what sovereignty 
and 
competence mean and what is eaten with them is unpromising at 
the start of negotiations, particularly if the political and 
economic situation is exacerbated. You can speak for as long as 
you like about who invests the "sovereignty" concept with what 
meaning. But each party understands by these words a sum total 
of practical rights: in the foreign economic sphere, in the 
management of state property, in budget and tax relations. But 
in the consciousness of a politician these concepts should be 
out of the frame, as it were. It is necessary for a start to 
negotiate on practical matters. Here we have oil industry, for 
example, here we have rail transport, here we have the activity 
of the law enforcement authorities, here we have tax rates. And 
when a specific agreement has been signed on each of these 
questions, the political component of the dispute, it 
transpires, and its seriousness and debatability disappear. And, 
as a result, it transpires that the tasks for the sake of which 
the concepts of sovereignty and independence were invented have 
already been accomplished, and it is possible to reach agreement 
according to other formulas. 
  [Zamyatina] Why are attempts not being made to realize this 
model in relations with the Chechen Republic? 
  [Pain] A common ideology of the approach to a resolution of 
this problem has yet to be formulated at the level of the 
Russian leadership. Attempts were made to approach it from 
positions of strength, as did Rutskoy, and, on the other hand, 
to forget about it altogether, a Bermuda triangle, in which 
everything "cooks" itself, as it were, having been created. But 
in real life the stereotyped patterns do not work, they prove 
unrealistic. In respect to Chechnya, therefore, I find 
absolutely comprehensible today merely the impermissibility of 
an armed solution of the problem, which would be madness. 
  [Zamyatina] The two years of Chechnya's independence have 
revealed a certain threshold of readiness not only of the 
politicians but also of the population of the republic for a 
settlement of the situation. Actual steps and action are needed. 
What do the Russian authorities think in this connection? 
  [Shakhray] The authorities are the president, parliament, 
and 
the government. Any minister or the leader of any department 
feels himself to be in an ambiguous position when on the one 
hand he is told: "give pensions to the population of Chechnya" 
or "allow the transportation of freight," and, on the other, 
there is, seemingly, sovereignty and independence there. By the 
decisions of the former Supreme Soviet the federal authorities 
deemed the elections in Chechnya illegal, and the regime, 
illegal, but have not further identified their position. And for 
this reason any minister, myself included, not having an 
official position, would in embarking upon negotiations be doing 
so at his own risk. 
  [Zamyatina] But you are not "any minister," you are minister 
for nationalities and a member of the government presidium.... 
  [Shakhray] I will hold consultations, I am prepared for the 
start of negotiations, as soon as the appropriate political 
decision is made. 
  [Zamyatina] In a forecast for 1994 you, Sergey Mikhaylovich, 
expressed the fear that the present year could be one of 
interethnic conflicts. Your reasoning? 
  [Shakhray] There are a minimum of three reasons for this. 
First, an unconcealed political struggle among democrats, 
communists, nationalists, and so forth continues at the federal 
level. The regions have been left to their own devices. It is 
easy to take advantage of this situation to raise the national 
banner or the problem of economic independence. 
  The second reason is to be found in the text of the new 
constitution, from which at the final stage of modification many 
provisions that were by nature federative were ejected. This has 
engendered a certain tension in some republics. The treaty with 
Tataria provided a very big release in this connection, 
incidentally, showing that the center is taking the path of the 
country's conversion into a genuine federation. Speak with any 
Tatar in Moscow (and this is Russia's second biggest nation in 
terms of numbers), and it will be confirmed for you that this 
treaty is for the Tatars a grand occasion signifying that 
Russia's relations with their ethnic homeland have at last been 
normalized. 
  The third reason for a possible exacerbation of interethnic 
problems lies in the fact that the Russian population could with 
weapon in hand be a party to interethnic conflicts. Note that 
thus far the conflicts have been Ossetian-Ingush, 
Georgian-Ossetian, Abkhaz-Georgian. But now Cossacks unhappy at 
the problems of the redistribution of land and the purge of 
personnel in the authorities of practically all national regions 
could, for example, be involved in them for the first time. 
  It should be said for fairness' sake that the unconcealed 
supplanting of national personnel, Caucasians primarily, in 
various ministries and departments is taking place in Moscow 
also. If they are not actually being dismissed, they are, in any 
event, being put in a position in which they are being forced to 
leave of their own accord.... 
  [Zamyatina] What paths of an alleviation of these tensions 
did you attempt to put into the president's report? 
  [Shakhray] We have already spoken of one possible method in 
the example of Tataria, making it understood to the national 
republics that there will no longer be a return to voluntarism. 
  In the report, on the other hand, we tried to explain 
convincingly that federation, as a form of state arrangement, 
protects the small peoples and nationalities from the pressure 
of the central and local bureaucracy. 
  Another form of protection of the interests of the populace 
is the transition from debate to the realization of the concept 
of national and cultural autonomy. The time is coming for the 
abandonment of the principle of "for each nation--its own 
state." It is necessary to proceed along the path of recognition 
that Russia is the common form of state self-determination of 
all 15 of our national groups. 
  [Pain] There is an objective contradiction between two types 
of organization of the state: national-territorial and 
territorial-administrative. But national-territorial formations 
cannot be abolished by decree. They are, meanwhile, the sole 
form of preservation of the national culture and demographic 
self-preservation of the nations. 
  But the national republics in their present form, while 
ensuring the possibility of self-preservation of the titular 
nation, far from always create such conditions for a nontitular 
nation. Various forms of cultural autonomies are needed for the 
national minorities also. 
  And, finally, all national processes are to a considerable 
extent grounded in economics. When truly market relations take 
shape, the differences between the national republics and other 
components of the Federation will be supplanted. 
  [Zamyatina] I shall permit myself to quote the classics: "It 
is a pity only that neither I nor you will live in this splendid 
time." And I would like to bring you, my esteemed partners, back 
from the future to the present day--to the search for 
practicable solutions to the interethnic problems of the North 
Caucasus, for example. You, Emil Abramovich, last year received 
the Woodrow Wilson International Center prize for the theory of 
prevention of interethnic conflicts. Is it applicable on native 
soil? 
  [Pain] We propose three basic principles of approach to the 
nationality problem. The first is the main national parity. Its 
essence lies not only in equality between components of the 
Federation and not only between people in relation to the law 
but also in the fact that no ethnic group on the territory of 
the Russian Federation has a monopoly right to resources, to 
institutions of power, and so forth. We put this formula of 
national parity into the text of the president's report. 
  The other two principles represent instruments of 
realization 
of the first, as it were. They concern the self-organization of 
the nations on the basis of local government and state 
paternalism in respect to national groups which are particularly 
in need of care--the small peoples of the North, for example. 
  [Shakhray] And I would mention that in a country in which 
Russians constitute 83 percent of the population, all 
politicians need to constantly bear in mind that the general 
feelings of all the other peoples of Russia depend on the 
general feelings of the Russian nation. 
  [Pain] And the fate of Russians is still determined to the 
greatest extent by how stable society is. I say all this to 
spite some artificial forms of the protection of Russians of the 
Russian Republic type, which are being put forward frequently. 
  [Shakhray] As far as Russians in the near abroad are 
concerned, Russia has legal, including international-legal, 
commitments to them. And the essence of my plan for the 
protection of Russians in the near abroad, which will evoke 
irritation in some people, consists of Russia being the 
successor of the USSR internationally, and of citizens with 
passports of the USSR who have not acquired the citizenship of 
another state, being under the jurisdiction of Russia. 
  I believe also that the Russian Federation cannot be fenced 
off by economic or border barriers from the republics of the 
CIS. This would create an environment for the subsequent 
departure from there of the Russian population. 
  And, the final point: The Russian Federation should not be 
embarrassed at maintaining military bases in these regions on a 
treaty basis. Because, as events in a number of former Union 
republics have shown, other ways of preserving civil peace and 
harmony and of preventing conflicts are insufficient. 
  This argument could be continued, but humanism in quotation 
marks leads to hundreds of thousands of people dying on account 
of it. 
  [Pain] I am disturbed in this argument by the fact that the 
talk about the protection of Russians is partially reminiscent 
of the former Soviet campaigns--like Protection of Children 
Month. Whence all kinds of backing and forthing. 
  [Shakhray] It has reached the point in the State Duma of a 
vote on the formation of a committee for the protection of 
Russians in Russia. Imagine, this proposal had the support of 
140 deputies. 
  [Zamyatina] And how do you see the protection of the rights 
of Russians in the near abroad? 
  [Pain] As I have already said, the need for such protection 
is frequently being discussed today in the spirit of the former 
Soviet campaigns. Much in the way of posturing, distortion, and 
insincerity. After all, no less urgent than the protection of 
rights for the Russian diaspora is the task of self-organization. 
  More than three-fourths of the Russian diaspora of the near 
abroad lives in Ukraine, in Belarus, in Kazakhstan--on land on 
which Russians have lived for centuries--and they have no desire 
to leave their native parts. For this reason the strategic line 
of Russia's policy should be promotion of the full-fledged 
inclusion of the Russian diaspora in the life of the new 
independent states. In some cases such integration is possible 
in the form of cultural autonomy, in others, administrative 
autonomy, like the Crimean Republic, but support for the idea of 
the reunification of the lands with Russia is absolutely 
impermissible. Under the present conditions such demands could 
result merely in most acute conflicts, and the first casualties 
of these are, as experience shows, the national minorities. 
  Another important principle of Russia's policy in relation 
to 
the near abroad should be an extra-ethnic approach to the 
defense of human rights. Democratic Russia is simply duty bound 
by its international status to prevent the infringement of the 
rights both of the Russian diaspora and of all other ethnic 
minorities. As the state which is the successor of the Soviet 
Union, it must display a readiness (for certain transitional 
period) to accept on its territory any citizen of the USSR, 
regardless of his nationality. 
  And, finally, the basis of a civilized policy is always the 
principle of equivalence and parity. If Russia is seeking an 
improvement in the conditions of the cultural life of Russians 
in the near abroad, it should itself do the same for the 
minorities residing on its territory. In Ukraine, for example, 
there are dozens of functioning Russian theaters, but in Russia, 
in which Ukrainians constitute the third group in terms of size, 
there is not a single Ukrainian theater. If Russia is seeking 
the right of dual citizenship for Russians in Kazakhstan, it is 
obliged to grant the almost 1 million Kazakhs on its territory a 
similar right. It is useful to imagine here a situation in which 
citizens of another state constitute the majority in certain 
areas on the border with Kazakhstan. 
  [Zamyatina] How is your idea of Russians' adaptation to the 
conditions of the new independent states to be combined with the 
fact that they are simply being squeezed out of there? 
  [Pain] There are two sides to this coin. There is a 
situation 
in which representatives of the Russian diaspora are not being 
admitted to citizenship, and there are regions where they 
themselves are still choosing and thinking, so to speak. The 
choice is frequently complicated by the idea of restoration of 
the Soviet Union. 
  Many problems could be resolved were it possible within the 
framework of the CIS to agree on cooperation on assurance of the 
rights of the national minorities and to remove the restrictions 
on freedom of the residence and movement of people which ensue 
today from the difference in their citizenship. 
  [Shakhray] I agree that it is essential that the Russians in 
the near abroad display greater assertiveness for 
self-organization. But in the regions where there are political 
and psychological barriers to such adaptation we should 
determine what is meant by protection of the Russian-speaking 
population. It is here that the possibilities need to be 
differentiated. As far as the Baltic is concerned, chiefly 
economic forms of pressure and appeals to international 
standards are applicable there. In Central Asia other solutions 
are needed. On the whole, however, a systemic approach to this 
problem is needed. 
  Summing up our discussion, I would like to mention that 
federalism is for Russia the sole way to preserve the 
territorial integrity of the state. The dilemma here is 
perfectly straightforward: Either the disintegration of the 
country or genuine federalism. There is no other way. 
  [Zamyatina] The final question, Sergey Mikhaylovich. How 
adequately are the ideas for a strengthening of federalism in 
Russia proposed by you and your Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord being received by the president and the government? Do 
you entertain hopes of these ideas being practicable? 
  [Shakhray] I will say this: There has been progress. Neither 
the president nor the prime minister are any longer rejecting 
these problems as incomprehensible, they recognize increasingly 
that real control of the economy and the territories is possible 
only on the principles of federalism. 
  The problem is that a lack of translation of conceptual 
ideas 
into the language of laws and practical organizational forms in 
respect to delineation of authority is perceived as yet. The 
leaders of the regions, seeking independence, are demanding of 
the center, as before, the solution of, say, questions of 
housing and municipal services in their republics, krays, and 
oblasts. They forget that the powers of the components of the 
Russian Federation should be exactly as many as may be realized 
at the regional level without disruption of the unity of the 
Russian state and its constitutional principles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray by Yegor Yakovlev; place and </F>
date not given: "Who Has the Right To Determine Who's To Blame?"] 
  [Text] [Yakovlev] During the referendum and subsequently, 
when the Constitutional Assembly was meeting, we touched 
repeatedly on the subject of choice. I said that the very 
problem of choice, the lesser of two evils, was essentially 
immoral. You, on the other hand, maintained that there are times 
of forced choice, when this is essential in the name of higher 
goals, for the sake, for example, of avoiding civil war. And you 
continued: A new constitution will be adopted, elections will be 
held, and we will have an opportunity to act on the basis of 
moral convictions. All this has happened. Now you and your 
faction in the Duma have voted for a political amnesty for the 
prisoners of Lefortovo. This was a free choice, so its time had 
come? 
  [Shakhray] The choice about which you speak was made by me 
consciously and voluntarily, and I consider it, as before, 
correct. As far, however, as actual preferences are concerned, 
we will still be balancing on the razor's edge for quite some 
time. Take the present situation concerning the constitution. 
The majority of those in the Duma recognize, I believe, neither 
the constitution nor the Duma, but are, nonetheless, using both 
to resolve their problems. This does not afford them any 
delight, of course, and they are looking for sympathy. I made my 
choice on the basis of the fact that as of 3-4 October we have 
been in a state of civil war, although there are no hostilities 
currently. The possibility of their resumption is for me not 
ruled out. And I chose between the just but abstract demand for 
the proceedings to be brought to the point of the rendering of a 
judgment or, on the other hand, the adoption of a decision on 
amnesty as an important step en route to civil reconciliation. 
  Let us look the truth in the eye. On the first day of 
business of the Duma it became obvious that it would adopt a 
decision on a political amnesty. This was borne out by the test 
voting, when on each occasion there was a shortage of two to 
five votes. But if a fact is obvious, it is necessary to think 
through one's actions on the basis of this fact. Otherwise it 
remains merely to throw up one's hands, which is what we are 
today doing: Where were the advisers, analysts, aides? 
  We decided to support the amnesty not for amnesty's sake but 
as a step on the way toward civil reconciliation. And we 
insisted that this be done in a particular sequence, what is 
more. First, a Memorandum of Accord adopted by the Duma, then 
the negotiations of all political sides and branches of power, 
at which the terms of political, socioeconomic, and interethnic 
stabilization for the coming two years would be recorded. 
Finally, the president and parliament would adopt a document on 
legal guarantees of a political truce, the amnesty included. And 
only after this would the people go free. The sequence was 
broken, unfortunately. The communists and the agrarians wanted 
an amnesty without any obligations. And Russia's Choice believed 
that it would prevent this, manifestly overestimating its 
possibilities. 
  [Yakovlev] But if the planned sequence in civil 
reconciliation was unsuccessful, you should not have voted for 
the amnesty, perhaps? 
  [Shakhray] People breathe a sigh of relief when if only some 
opportunity for reconciliation appears. There is currently a 
mass of calls, and I am receiving a heap of telegrams from the 
provinces: Go for the next steps. I confess, this is for me the 
sole outlet in the information blockade in which I have found 
myself in Moscow.... Following the amnesty, there have come to 
be more opportunities for reconciliation, incidentally. We need 
to be able to avail ourselves of them. The time for this is two 
months. 
  Besides, the present political amnesty has a number of 
paradoxical features, which are easily predicted. The amnesty 
corresponds to the interests of the president and the 
government. It is more beneficial having Rutskoy and Khasbulatov 
at liberty than in Lefortovo. In addition, the people who have 
been released have undertaken, as it were, not to call for 
bloodshed, assaults in the future.... 
  [Yakovlev] Permit my disbelief: I heard what Anpilov was 
shouting as he came through the gate, and I know the character 
of Konstantinov. 
  [Shakhray] If Anpilov or Konstantinov once again call for 
violence, the law enforcement authorities should act on the 
basis of the new circumstances.... A second paradox of the 
amnesty: It will be followed, in my view, by quite a lengthy 
period of interaction of the president, the government, and 
parliament. A considerable part of the Duma has discharged its 
election commitments: the release of the above-mentioned 
persons. Now they have no interest in the further elevation of 
either Rutskoy or Khasbulatov, they need other leaders. They 
will not, most likely, move to exacerbate the confrontation with 
the president: The law of self-preservation will operate. 
  [Yakovlev] Today we know that the president did not comment 
on the amnesty directly. But the pressure on the prosecutor 
general led to his resignation. Aleksey Kazannik believed that 
it was more important to be honest than to swear fealty to the 
president. As far, however, as his entourage is concerned, how 
many days is it now that it has been publicly confessing that it 
was unable, did not know, could not think how to get around, as 
it were, what should be done according to the law. 
  [Shakhray] You are to a large extent right, unfortunately. 
In 
addition, we have seen for ourselves that, apparently, we lack a 
mechanism of the interaction of president and parliament. The 
president, parliament, the public prosecutor's office, and the 
judicial system. But if intelligent conclusions are drawn from 
this lesson, what I have said: The need for forced 
reconciliation, will have been confirmed. 
  [Yakovlev] I cannot say that I share your opinion, at the 
same time, on the other hand, I accept what is undoubtedly 
reasonable in your arguments. But how, pray, is it possible to 
be reconciled with the disregard for public opinion that was 
manifested so forcefully at that time? The gate of Lefortovo was 
flung open without people even having been told who were to 
blame--the one who signed the edict, violating the constitution 
and breaking up parliament, or those who, lodged in the White 
House, called for the storming of the Kremlin. Do you believe 
that it is not you and I but merely posterity that should answer 
this? 
  [Shakhray] There is the ancient piece of wisdom, which has 
with time become a legal axiom: You cannot be the judge at your 
own trial. Both parties to the conflict are to blame, and 
neither of them has either the moral or the political right to 
condemn the other. You ask: Why are we leaving this to 
posterity? I shall answer the question with a question: Who 
would determine who was guilty? The victorious presidential 
party wanted to do so today. But if tomorrow there are 
multiple-choice elections, will those who lost the October 
events start to point to the guilty party? As far as public 
opinion is concerned, it has already rendered its verdict, and I 
can merely repeat it: A plague on both your houses. 
  [Yakovlev] When I speak of the need to explain to people 
what 
happened on 3-4 October, I am not thinking merely in categories 
of the judicial investigation. It seems to me that the president 
should get up and tell people: In signing the edict of 21 
September dissolving parliament I was a poor statesman insofar 
as I was unable to weigh the consequences this would have. Both 
Rutskoy and Khasbulatov should make their confessions: Lodged in 
the White House, we were thinking only of ourselves, of our 
power, forgetting about the inevitability of the casualties, 
which we had provoked.... 
  [Shakhray] Were the said people capable of steps such as you 
have mentioned, we would not, possibly, have the present crisis.

<F P=106> [Statements by political figures, from INTERFAX, POSTFAFTUM, </F>
and ITAR-TASS material; places and dates not given: "Man Guilty 
of National Consensus Found: an Honest Jurist Follows in the 
Footsteps of Procurator Pilate"] 
  [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (chairman of the State Duma 
Defense Committee): "Aleksey Kazannik's resignation as 
Russian Federation procurator general is to his credit; it 
shows, however, that the procuracy is poorly prepared for 
practical work. The Constitutional Court also could have 
demanded that the Duma stick to the rules, but there is no law 
on the Constitutional Court. Overall, this speaks of the 
weakness of the president's power. 
  "The government is not against carrying out the amnesty. 
Indirect proof of this is the way the PRES [Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord] and the pro-government New Regional Policy 
faction have voted... The government does not have a concrete 
program and is looking for a scapegoat on whom to dump 
responsibility for what is happening in the country." 
  Viktor Mironov (deputy chairman of the Duma Security 
Committee, member of the Russia's Choice faction): "Having 
accepted the amnesty, the criminals acknowledged their 
responsibility for the hundreds of people killed... I hope that 
the president and the enforcement structures will not allow it 
to come to a civil war... The duty of democratically minded 
people is to unite around the Russia's Choice party." 
  Lev Ponomarev (cochairman of Democratic Russia 
movement): "Kazannik betrayed the president, who had 
appealed to him to hold up the amnesty process." 
  Ivan Fedoseyev (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
Constitutional Committee, Russia faction coordinator, Russian 
All-Peoples Union cochairman): "I hope that Ruslan 
Imranovich will have enough wisdom not to exhort people to mass 
actions today... The legitimacy of both the new Constitution and 
the State Duma is questionable; however, it is unlikely that the 
voters would agree with it, and Ruslan Khasbulatov must take 
this into account. 
  Ivan Shashviashvili (Russia faction): "Ruslan 
Imranovich should enter the political arena in his old capacity 
as Russian Federation Supreme Soviet chairman--the only 
legitimate body of state power despite the October massacre." 
  Vladimir Isakov (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
Constitutional Committee, chairman of the Legislative and 
Judiciary Reform Committee): "I hope that the released 
prisoners will have enough political wisdom not to jump into 
politics in the next few months. This would seriously complicate 
the situation in the country." 
  Mikhail Astafyev (chairman of the Constitutional 
Democratic Party): The key figure today is Aleksandr 
Rutskoy. There are two presidents in Russia today, and only one 
of them--Rutskoy--is the legitimate one. This seriously 
complicates the political situation." 
  Ruslan Khasbulatov: "I do not see real politicians 
in our country, I do not see anyone in the leadership with whom 
you could reach an agreement and who would then keep their word. 
Machiavelli is a child compared to them. For me, on the other 
hand, moral principles in politics are particularly important... 
Had I not been released by the Duma decision, I would still have 
been freed--first, because the investigators were not able to 
find corpus delicti, and second, because of my state of 
health... An attempt to return to Lefortovo those who have been 
released from the investigative detention facility under amnesty 
will only underline the stupidity of the organizers of such 
actions. In the near future I intend to sort out my papers... I 
have felt my heart for the first time, how it hurts; therefore, 
I have to take care of my health right now..." 
  Ilya Konstantinov (National Salvation Front 
leader): "The former Lefortovo prisoners do not want to see 
the political struggle in Russia transcend the boundaries of 
legitimacy, and intend to help stabilize the political 
situation... Attempts to link the political amnesty with the 
beginning of a new round of civil war in Russia are a political 
provocation." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov: "The act of releasing from 
Lefortovo the organizers of and participants in the October 1993 
events is a blasphemous deed... People who were ready to push 
Russia into a bloodbath have been set free without a trial... 
The deputies abused the trust people vested in them and took the 
side of state villains... Aleksey Kazannik's resignation is the 
reaction of an extremely noble and decent man who has been put 
in a difficult legal situation... Until a new general procurator 
is appointed, the situation will be deadlocked." 
  Gavriil Popov, Russian Democratic Reform Movement 
chairman): "The president's staff has displayed amazing 
inaction... The president could have made an anticipatory move 
on the Duma decision by offering it his own version of amnesty, 
which would have precisely and clearly specified the terms on 
which the criminal case is dismissed; one such term could be a 
ban on participation in political activities for a certain 
period of time... The course of investigation in the GKChP 
[State Committee on the State of Emergency] case and the October 
events has demonstrated the complete helplessness of the law 
enforcement system; a top to bottom purge of the procuracy is 
needed." 
  Sergey Shakhray: "The amnesty is in line with the 
strategic interests of the president and the government... The 
president loses more politically by keeping his opponents behind 
bars... At the same time, the result of violating the logic of 
the national reconciliation plan proposed by the PRES, in which 
the amnesty is only one element, bundled together with a 
memorandum of accord and the decision on disbanding the 
commission on investigation of the October events, will be that 
those released will again jump into political struggle. Its 
outcome will depends on random factors... Aleksey Kazannik's 
resignation may plunge the procuracy into the orbit of political 
passions." 
  Shmidt Dzyublyayev (general secretary of the Assembly 
of North Caucasus Democratic Forces): "The economic and 
political situation makes it incumbent on the president of 
Russia to impose a state of emergency... The Duma decision is an 
unprecedented act of absolute disrespect for the law... Sergey 
Shakhray should share responsibility for this with the communist 
obscurantists." 
  Yuriy Baturin (the president's national security 
adviser): "The president of Russian Federation's appeal to 
the State Duma with the proposal to modify the decree on the 
amnesty should have cleared the way for the reconciliation 
process. However, the haste of general procuracy members 
considerably complicated the situation... This haste was 
displayed even contrary to the position of the State Duma 
itself... It is clear that General Procurator Kazannik's own 
position in this case was duplicitous... I can say that he has 
deceived us." 
  Ivan Rybkin: "If some people show that they do not 
have enough brains and compassion not to start a confrontation, 
the State Duma will see to it that such people are severely 
punished... Perhaps in the future a memorandum should be 
adopted, upon concurrence with other branches of authority, on a 
system of criteria and the mechanism of responsibility of state 
institutions and politicians for decisions aimed at reaching 
civic peace, national reconciliation, and consensus." 
  Mikhail Poltoranin: "The president cannot relax 
the reins of power; otherwise, the chariot of Russian statehood 
will overturn."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Petrovich Barkashov, leader of </F>
Russian National Unity, by Sergey Turchenko; place and date not 
given: "A Meeting With Aleksandr Barkashov--the Bricked Up 
Knight's Sword"] 
  [Text] He was released from "Sailor's Rest" at 1815 
on 26 February. Despite a serious bullet wound to the thigh, he 
came out of the prison by himself, adroitly supporting himself 
on crutches that have already become habitual. 
  Supporters had been waiting at the gate since 0900. A 
Russian National Unity honor guard company in full dress uniform 
was in formation. It greeted its leader with the thrice-repeated 
yell: "Glory to Russia!" Barkashov embraced each one of them and 
departed for home, where he has not been since 20 September 1993. 
  The building in which Aleksandr Petrovich lives had two 
exits as recently as five months ago. One to the courtyard, the 
other to Leninskiy Prospekt. When in October of last year the 
sleuths of "democratic" detection were hunting for the leader of 
Russian National Unity, the second exit was walled up with brick 
masonry so they would not have to maintain two posts of 
"operatives" here simultaneously. This wall has remained as a 
modest monument to victorious "democracy." 
  We met with Aleksandr Petrovich several days after his 
release at his apartment, which was left in a more than frugal 
condition. It had neither rugs nor expensive furniture. On the 
wall, next to Orthodox icons, was an ancient Russian knight's 
sword as the symbol of a fighting faith. Wounded, wasted by 
prison, Barkashov appeared the inflexible monk of this 
courageous religion to which Russia is doomed. 
  After congratulating Aleksandr Petrovich on his release, I 
asked him how he felt about the amnesty. 
  [Barkashov] I think it is a compromise step on the part of 
those forces that did not want the investigative activities with 
respect to the "October prisoners" to reach the court, because 
this would reveal the true culprits of the mass murders in 
October of last year. Other forces were able through the act of 
amnesty to resolve their own concerns, for example, to release 
the criminals, because those forces do not have another social 
base. As for me personally, I interpreted the amnesty in a 
positive way, since I know that in our country an investigation 
can drag on for years and not come to anything. But sitting in 
prison is not for me, I have to be active. In addition, I 
understand that this was an act that the authorities were forced 
into, and not some kind of sop. The public conscience had 
reached a level that the authorities could not risk holding us 
under guard anymore. What is more, I do not feel any kind of 
guilt for myself. On the contrary, the Procuracy committed such 
a string of violations in my arrest that I do not know how it 
would extricate itself were it not for the amnesty. 
  [Turchenko] Our newspaper informed the readers about this in 
detail. But we have hardly written about the activities of 
Barkashov supporters in September-October of 1993. 
  [Barkashov] As early as spring, when an attempt was made to 
introduce OPUS [special procedure for governing the country], we 
announced that if the president decided to dissolve parliament 
and usurp power, we were ready with all available resources to 
oppose this. After the publication of Edict No. 1400, a subunit 
consisting of 300 persons arrived at the House of Soviets in an 
organized way. For the first two days, it was on the street. 
Afterwards, we settled ourselves in the reception room of the 
Supreme Soviet. Soon, information began to arrive that forceful 
actions were being planned against the leaders of the Supreme 
Soviet, and even that an assault on the building was being 
prepared. The need arose to reinforce the security of higher 
state officials and the internal premises of the House of 
Soviets. We were asked to take part in this, and we were 
assigned specific places to guard, in particular, the Ministry 
of Defense, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the MB 
[Ministry of Security], and various vital life-support centers 
where, through underground communications, it was possible to 
get through to the inside of buildings. Our people guarded 
Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at their request. 
  On 2 October we heard growing noise, and even shooting, from 
the Smolensk Square side. I sent my scouts to find out what was 
happening there. They went and returned through underground 
communications. They reported that the OMON [special purpose 
militia detachment] had provoked a clash and that people had 
been killed and wounded. That was the first time that weapons 
were employed against unarmed people. We have documentary 
pictures from which it can be seen how individual OMON members 
were firing from pistols at a short distance into the crowd. For 
some reason I did not see a word about this in the press. In 
addition, we also discovered that some foreign inspectors who 
were working under the Red Cross service for some reason were 
directing the activities of the OMON members, special purpose 
elements, and the militia. People were sitting in vehicles with 
foreign infantry weapons, and they were speaking in English. It 
became clear that a tragedy was developing under foreign 
leadership. 
  [Turchenko] Do you have documentary evidence of this? 
  [Barkashov] Yes, sir. When the time comes, I will publish 
it. 
  [Turchenko] But, in your opinion, did the other events of 3 
October not appear to be a tragic play acted out by foreign 
intelligence services in order to eliminate the most active 
patriotically inclined citizens? 
  [Barkashov] I am convinced that 3 October was a real 
people's 
uprising. Almost half a million insurgents. The age group: 
youths from 16 to 25 and older men from 35 to 55, mainly workers 
and the technical intelligentsia. Plus a lot of women. Despite 
the clubs and tear gas, they breached several OMON barricades 
and in an absolutely sincere outburst broke through toward the 
House of Soviets. 
  [Turchenko] I absolutely agree, as a people's uprising the 
October display was spontaneous, if, of course, the fact that 
for a whole week prior to this people were provoked to uprising 
by unjustified harsh beatings is ignored. But does it not seem 
strange to you that it was exactly on 3 October that the militia 
and the OMON left the House of Soviets? 
  [Barkashov] You know, they did not leave. They scattered. 
The 
Dzerzhinskiy division, after receiving information about such a 
mass of people, quickly pulled out and departed in panic to its 
permanent station. Special purpose and OMON subunits also 
scattered in panic. Commanders abandoned their subordinates. We 
brought to the House of Soviets two companies of soldiers of the 
Internal Troops whose commanders had abandoned them. Later, two 
companies from Sofrino simply announced the desire to switch to 
the side of the insurgents. Only those who established 
themselves in the mayor's office fired on citizens. For some 
reason, nothing is being written about this, but I personally 
saw how people were wounded and killed by this fire. When in an 
outburst of indignation the crowd desperately hurled itself at 
the mayor's office, the firing became more intense. In order not 
to permit unnecessary bloodshed, seven of my companions, plus 
four fellows from the Union of Officers, rushed over there. All 
it took was several warning bursts for the mayor's office to 
quiet down. Then we led the half-drunk defenders of "democracy" 
away. 
  [Turchenko] But why was it necessary go after Ostankino? 
  [Barkashov] The leadership of the Supreme Soviet in those 
days undoubtedly displayed high courage. But in addition to 
courage, an ability to organize the popular masses was also 
needed. 
  [Turchenko] In your opinion, to organize what? 
  [Barkashov] This does not at all mean to shoot, to assault. 
It was enough with organized groups to take control of Moscow's 
main facilities. The march on Ostankino was a purely emotional 
outbreak: "The empire, they said, lies, a nest of evil..." I 
agree. But in such situations it is necessary to be guided not 
by emotions, but by sober calculation. If we need the television 
airwaves in order to tell people the truth about the events in 
Moscow, send a group of workers to Shabolovka, which was 
practically unguarded. And go on the air. There were many 
organizational miscalculations. As a result, the authorities 
gained time and the opportunity to organize the shelling of the 
House of Soviets. All that time our subunit was performing the 
duties entrusted to it, and was prepared to stand to the end. 
But when the leadership made the decision about going out, it 
made no sense to remain in the House of Soviets. On the evening 
of 4 October we surrendered our weapons in an organized way, and 
I ordered the boys to go out. I myself remained with Achalov 
when he was arrested, and demanded that I be taken together with 
him. However, an officer of the Ministry of Security answered 
that he had no instructions concerning me, and he advised that I 
leave with the "Alpha." I want to express my great gratitude to 
the officers of this subunit. Had it not been for them, there 
would have been far more victims. In any case, when "Alpha" 
turned the group with which I came out over to the OMON people, 
they took us in the direction of the stadium where, as we 
already knew, massive executions were being conducted. However, 
when officers of "Alpha" noticed this they raised their assault 
rifles and said firmly: Release these people. We were 
released... Unfortunately, not all of our boys remained alive. 
On 4 October, Dmitriy Marchenko, the editor of the letters 
department of our newspaper RUSSKIY PORYADOK, was wounded in the 
leg. He was taken to Sklifosovskiy. But relatives were soon 
informed that he was dead. When they came for him, they saw 
traces of brutal torture on his body. His nose and ears were 
torn off, the tendons in his legs were cut, and the back of his 
head was shot through. The body of Guards Major Anatoliy Surskiy 
was also found with traces of ritual torture. 
  [Turchenko] What did you do after you left the House of 
Soviets? 
  [Barkashov] We received information from our own people in 
the MVD that there was a directive to arrest a group of 
activists from Russian National Unity and, in addition, the 
chiefs would have no objection if anyone was shot while 
resisting arrest. It became necessary to shift to an illegal 
situation. 
  [Turchenko] How did the October events affect Russian 
National Unity, did they not disorganize the movement? 
  [Barkashov] On the contrary, the fighting men became 
stronger 
in spirit. We saw a large influx of new people into the 
organization. Many youths. Workers of many of the Moscow plants 
sympathize with our views, and the first Russian National Unity 
cells have been established there. 
  [Turchenko] Would you be able to name at least the 
approximate numerical strength of your organization? 
  [Barkashov] The fact is that our membership is three-staged. 
The first stage is the most numerous--these are sympathizers. 
Those who are most active and who have shown their worth move to 
the second stage--fellow-fighters. They go through special 
training in our, so to say, training institutions, they perform 
one-time or permanent assignments. Achieving a certain level, a 
fellow-fighter can become a companion-in-arms. This is a direct 
member of our organization with pertinent rights and 
disciplinary duties. I will not name the figure for all of 
Russia. But in Moscow we have about 1,500 companions-in-arms and 
more than 10,000 fellow-fighters, and there are several times 
more sympathizers. 
  [Turchenko] What is the system of training in Russian 
National Unity? 
  [Barkashov] We place the main emphasis on political and 
ideological training, to put it more exactly, on world outlook. 
Our main weapon is propaganda and agitation. Further, there is 
tactics, firing training, and hand-to-hand combat. 
  [Turchenko] What does ideological training mean? Could you 
briefly formulate its basis? 
  [Barkashov] It is very difficult to do so briefly. Its 
essence is awakening the national self-consciousness of the 
Russian people. Because as our statehood was built around the 
Russian people, so it will be revived around a Russian nucleus. 
The main thing is that it is necessary to show the whole truth 
to the people to the end. So that they may see not in words but 
with their own eyes that they are on the brink of extinction, 
and so that the instinct of self-preservation be turned on. It 
is necessary to point out their main enemy. And one exists, for 
a struggle between good and evil is going on in the world. 
  [Turchenko] What capabilities do you have to report this 
truth? 
  [Barkashov] First, a press organ--the newspaper RUSSKIY 
PORYADOK. The circulation is quite high--400,000. But it is also 
necessary to consider that its dissemination is targeted--only 
to the social environment that is of interest to us. In the 
present period, this is most of all workers and servicemen. 
  [Turchenko] What is the base in the military environment? 
  [Barkashov] There are companions-in-arms even in the senior 
generals milieu. There are fellow-fighters. The main mass is 
sympathizers. It is technically very difficult to establish 
primary Russian National Unity cells in the army, for the eyes 
and ears of the special department are everywhere. 
  [Turchenko] How do you work in the units? 
  [Barkashov] We arrive at the main gate checkpoint in the 
evening and disseminate newspapers in which there is always a 
contact telephone. Then you begin to get calls from the military 
unit, and later people walk in. And it is here that individual 
work with them starts. People receive individual instructions, 
they join our studies system, etc. 
  [Turchenko] But are people not repelled by the fact that the 
symbolism of your movement has an emblem that is reminiscent of 
the swastika, which gives some journalists a reason to accuse 
Russian National Unity of fascism? 
  [Barkashov] This is a democratic label. Our sign is the 
eight-pointed Star of Our Lady, who from days of old was 
respected in Rus. You will also find it on ancient icons and in 
the ornamental embroidery of Russian national costumes. We have 
explained all of this, with documents, more than once in our 
newspaper. When people read it, all questions are removed. 
  [Turchenko] But why is this sign not seen in today's 
Orthodox 
Church? 
  [Barkashov] Today's Orthodox Church promised to anathematize 
those who were the first to spill blood in October 1993. Instead 
of this, I see on television how priests kiss the organizers of 
murder. But God is their judge. As for the Star of Our Lady, its 
description is in all canonical literature and in icon 
paintings. All of this was gradually etched out of our memories, 
probably because previously the common people called this 
ancient sign a zhidobor [amulet to protect against Jews]. 
  [Turchenko] Fine, let us drop this subject. Tell us, how did 
you arrive at your present views? 
  [Barkashov] I am from a working family. My father worked all 
of his life in a TETs [thermal electric power center]. Mama was 
a nurse. I also worked at the same TETs for a long time as an 
electrician. As far as I can recall, I was always interested in 
books on Russian history. After 1985 I joined the Pamyat 
movement. I sensed in 1990 that it had become outdated. There 
was a need for a stronger and more united organization. Together 
with like-minded people, I left Pamyat and established Russian 
National Unity. My world outlook is from Russian historical 
science and knowledge of the attitudes of the working 
individual. But it was the development of the situation in the 
country itself that mobilized me to political activity. 
  [Turchenko] Of the parties that exist now, which do you 
cooperate with and which do you like most? 
  [Barkashov] We have a very strict ideology. It is difficult 
for us to find common language with those who paper over the 
cracks first and then join political games. We call things by 
their real names. Therefore, it is difficult to accept something 
like compromising alliances. But we are always ready to support 
tactically any political force that comes out for national 
interests. So the Supreme Soviet made a clear-cut statement 
about betrayal of national interests, and it said that it will 
defend them, and we immediately came to its assistance. 
  [Turchenko] What is your prediction for the near-term 
development of the situation in the country? 
  [Barkashov) Fundamental changes will occur this year. And if 
they are sufficiently fundamental (that is, if an uncompromising 
national policy is implemented), then within three years the 
people will be able to eliminate the consequences of the mess 
the reformers have created. 
  [Turchenko] But do you see such forces? 
  [Barkashov) I see the psychological condition of society, 
because I am not separated from it like Yeltsin, or as 
Khasbulatov was separated from it. Authority must resonate with 
the condition of society. If this does not exist, authority 
declines. Therefore, that is why changes have occurred: There is 
talk of accord, and the Russian question and changes in foreign 
policy are being stirred up. This, of course, is not out of 
goodwill. The present leadership simply understands that in its 
previous capacity it is becoming absolutely unacceptable to an 
overwhelming majority of the people. It will be forced to bring 
ever newer figures onto its staff until there is conformity 
between the will of the people and policy. 
  [Turchenko] The forecast is more than optimistic. Many 
thanks.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kuzina: "Does Russia Need Procurators </F>
and Judges Who Only Obey the Law?"] 
  [Text] There was a time when the representatives of the law 
needed celebrated cases and brilliant articles for fame. 
Everything is much simpler now. One only needs to observe the 
Constitution, and fame along with a position will cover you. 
Aleksey Kazannik, Valeriy Zorkin and, incidentally, even 
Valentin Stepankov proved that brilliantly. 
  Unfortunately, another question has remained opened: In 
today's Russia, can one combine observance of the law with a 
high position? Following the logic of the radical reformers and 
their popularizers, one cannot. During a recent television 
broadcast about A. Kazannik, they literally passed sentence -- a 
political Don Quiote -- with some sympathy for the former 
general procurator. He did not understand that they had brought 
him "upstairs" not for his professional qualities but only 
because he once did the president a good turn -- namely, a 
service. Personal devotion is the priority requirement for an 
official. 
  What does this mean in the judicial system? With the 
departure of people dedicated to the law from its "upper" 
stories, a complete failure awaits the system. Those who keep to 
the letter of the law will help. Already, there are not enough 
judges and people's assessors now. They are on the run under the 
threats of corrupted bureaucrats and legalized criminals. Only, 
where should the main mass of the population, from whom they 
have consistently and step by step taken away all the 
departments for protecting them beginning with our almost 
home-spun local trade union committees and ending with the 
opportunity to achieve justice in a court where one had not come 
with a purse, run? 
  This summer, I had an occasion to ask V. Zorkin how he would 
have acted if something similar to the celebrated OPUS [Osoboye 
Poryadok Upravleniya Stranoy--play on word "opus", meaning 
"work"] appeared again? 
  The answer was: 
  "I would have acted according to the constitution." 
  V. Zorkin proved this in the fall which does not now make 
him 
completely happy. 
  The Constitutional Court is still closed down. An 
individual, 
who is personally devoted but undergoing a libel case, is 
performing the duties of general procurator. The Constitution, 
even if it is a presidential one, leaves too broad a field for 
interpretation.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "For Whom Is Oleg Soskovets </F>
Working?"] 
  [Text] Negotiations of the leading aluminum 
producers--delegations of the United States, Russia, the 
European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway--will be held this 
week in Ottawa. If successful, agreements on the amounts of 
supplies of the product to the world market will be ratified. 
And in Moscow light will be shed, finally, on the fate of 
Anatoliy Dyakov, chairman of the Unified Power System of Russia 
stock company, whose removal is being spoken of in the Council 
of Ministers as a done deal. These two formally unconnected 
events have common roots. The initiator of Mr. Dyakov's 
dismissal and the key figure for presentation in Canada of 
Russia's "aluminum" position is Oleg Soskovets, first deputy 
chairman of the government. 
  The aluminum industry has become the most expressive 
example, 
perhaps, of Russia's "Asiatic" move onto Europe's metal markets. 
From 300,000 tonnes in 1990, our exports have jumped to 1.6 
million tonnes. Prices have collapsed almost twofold, and 
Western producers initially began to toss and turn and then, 
having instituted against Russia an anti-dumping inquiry, forced 
it into a civilized discussion, into consent to hold back its 
aluminum expansion included. 
  Having plucked the "foreign currency primrose," our 
enterprises have now encountered a very unpleasant situation: 
Exports have been compulsorily restricted, and the domestic 
prices of primary aluminum and rolled products have gone beyond 
world prices. In addition, the release price of the aluminum 
combines (2 million rubles [R] per tonne) is almost double the 
price of the independent dealers on the Moscow Metal Exchange. 
It is not surprising that demand for the enterprises' product 
has fallen. But the sector is in a mood neither to cut back on 
production nor to lose its dividends. And the only way it can 
preserve the status quo is to freeze the price of electric 
power, the consumption of which constitutes up to 30 percent of 
the prime costs of the output of the group of enterprises. 
  It has to be said that electric power is a natural monopoly, 
and the cost of a kilowatt-hour is, in any case, regulated, at 
three levels, what is more: The government determines the 
tariffs for the public and agriculture, the Federal Energy 
Commission establishes them for the Unified Power System of 
Russia regional stock company, which supplies the giants of 
industry, and the regional commissions impose tariffs for the 
local industrial enterprises. 
  In accordance with regulations approved last year for the 
Ministry of Economics, the electricity tariffs shall be revised 
"with a change in external conditions." The external conditions, 
that is, the prices of each and every thing, are growing by the 
month, and the electricity tariffs are raised administratively 
not more often than once a quarter. For the Unified Power System 
of Russia regional stock company, they have not been revised 
since September 1993. Rising up on each occasion as a wall has 
been Oleg Soskovets, who stated in February in the Council of 
Ministers Commission for Operational Matters that the power 
engineers had "established communism for one sector." Waves of 
indignation at the price policy of the fuel and energy complex, 
which is allegedly to blame for the endless inflation, have been 
rolling through the press in parallel with this. Clearly 
referring to the regional stock company's Mr. Dyakov, a 
representative of the industrial directors said that "one stock 
company is, in fact, directing the whole country." 
  The reasons for Oleg Soskovets' decisions, which are 
synchronous with the "public indignation," are, generally, there 
on the surface. On the one hand, the state's share of the 
exports of rolled aluminum constitutes 91 percent, and it does 
not, understandably, want such a channel of foreign currency to 
dry up. On the other, the prices of the extensive product list 
of the iron and steel complex have already scaled world heights, 
and the price of a kilowatt-hour is five times lower--and a 
further rise would confront a large sector of the economy with a 
dilemma: either bankruptcy or a difficult rearrangement of the 
groups of enterprises. "Power engineering is literally 
oppressing the entire economy. Prices in the regions are being 
established chaotically, essentially, and managers are not being 
held responsible or to account," Oleg Soskovets declared. 
  This position precisely reflects the group interests of 
market outsiders and has nothing in common with public 
interests. The first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers 
knows full well that it was the wild move "into the light" of 
Russia's metallurgists that knocked down world prices and that 
the energy consumption of aluminum industry considerably exceeds 
Western standards and is a consequence of the technological 
backwardness of the groups of enterprises. The abundance on the 
domestic market of imported commodities in aluminum wrapping 
against the drastic reduction in rolled products of this metal 
in Russia is clear evidence that the country is pumping cheap 
electricity to the West via aluminum. As far as the alleged 
arbitrary price action of the power engineers is concerned, this 
is, perhaps, the sole sector counting tariffs "the old 
way"--strictly according to the formulas from 21 supplements to 
the computation procedure, which can always easily be checked. 
  None of this is any secret for Mr. Soskovets. He could take 
on a task of truly state dimensions--gradually invert the 
pyramid of energy consumption in the country, whereby heavy 
industry bears the main price burden, and agriculture and the 
public get electricity for a pittance, virtually (5-6 percent of 
the cost). He could set about a leveling of the 20-fold price 
spread by region (threefold in the United States), for which he 
would win the industrial consumers' gratitude. But Oleg 
Soskovets, former chairman of the State Committee for 
Metallurgy, has opted for a path more in keeping, evidently, 
with the scale of his personality--he has begun to lobby 
Soviet-style for sectoral interests. When, in February, at a 
meeting of the board of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the 
power engineers presented him with evidence that the 
metallurgists, who were in debt to them, had money in their 
accounts, he told the meeting hall with irritation that "such 
shadowing is impermissible." He, however, beleaguered the power 
engineers who had shown him documents demonstrating how great 
was the prime cost of the product of the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk 
aluminum combines. And then Mr. Soskovets decided radically to 
"investigate" energy prices, instructing Anatoliy Chubays to 
study the question of the "expediency" of Anatoliy Dyakov 
continuing in office as chairman of the Unified Power System of 
Russia regional stock company. 
  Removing Mr. Dyakov as a warning is, generally, 
uncomplicated. As is, in principle, holding back energy prices. 
This would turn out badly for the whole economy, it is true. 
With the 46 percent wear and tear of power engineering 
equipment, a shortage of investments would very quickly result 
in a growth of the breakdown rate and a reduction in scheduled 
maintenance. The sector is, as a whole, inertial. You might not 
build here for a couple of years, and this hits three or four 
years later. At the start of the 1980's the introduction of 
capacity in power engineering constituted 10 million-12 million 
kilowatt-hours, incidentally; now, it is roughly 10 times less. 
  Oleg Soskovets has been "on the political Olympus" just 
under 
a year. Everyone has come in for it in this time--monetarists 
and "moderates"--and the press has hit at Gaydar and 
Chernomyrdin, Fedorov and Zaveryukha, Chubays and Glukhikh. The 
first deputy prime minister has, surprisingly, emerged from the 
battles totally "unscathed." He has remained beyond criticism, 
although industrial policy has failed completely, and the 
concept of financial and industrial groups sponsored by Mr. 
Soskovets is decaying at root. There have been no breakthroughs 
in the field of ideas, except for curatorship of the work of 
academicians Shatalin and Abalkin "on a correction of the course 
of the reforms." 
  Despite the lack of achievements, the first "vice" remains 
under a charm and continues to gain more and more political 
authority. According to a recent order of the prime minister, 
Oleg Soskovets will coordinate key spheres of economic policy 
and direct 14 ministries and departments, and the composition 
and structure of the federal executive authorities and the 
federal civil service are in his hands. He is head of the 
government's Commission for Operational Matters, to which the 
function of distribution of centrally allocated credit to 
industry was recently transferred. And this same commission, 
judging by documents of the Council of Ministers, will shortly 
win distribution of the Western credit received by Russia and 
the centrally allocated foreign exchange resources of the 
government. 
  In a short space of time the 44-year-old Oleg Soskovets has 
made a dizzying career from deputy chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of Kazakhstan to first deputy chairman of the Council 
of Ministers of Russia. He has concentrated an enormous amount 
of power in his hands. Both this surge and his being off limits 
for criticism on the part of the president and the prime 
minister compel doubts as to the authenticity of the original 
version of his elevation: Boris Yeltsin had brought into the 
government "his man" Lobov, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, in 
response, made a move with the little-known Soskovets. It would 
seem, however, that people had gambled on Oleg Soskovets 
somewhat earlier and had pushed him persistently and recommended 
him just as persistently to the prime minister. 
  Indicating who is "pushing" Oleg Soskovets is not that easy. 
One thing is for certain: Among the persons with an interest in 
him are the industrial directors who have not joined in the 
reforms.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Politkovskaya: "Television as a National </F>
Problem, or Is Life Possible Without Knife-Switches?"] 
  [Text] There is not a person in the country who would be 
satisfied with television in our country. However, when the 
danger started to appear on the horizon of finding ourselves in 
a television, and at the same time also in a radio vacuum, 
society united with incredible enthusiasm in the struggle for 
this narcotic accessible to all. 
  But in the meantime Premier Chernomyrdin and the cabinet 
headed by him did not especially want to give to television the 
budget funds earmarked for it. As a minimum, beginning in 
November they stopped the transfer to "Ostankino" and to the 
Russian Television and Radio Company the funds which they, in 
turn, must, without keeping them back in their account, transfer 
into the pocket of the Ministry of Communications. And the 
Ministry of Communications, as is well known, holds the monopoly 
in Russia over the distribution of the SIGNAL. . . . 
<H5>  Let Us Turn the Film Back </H5>
  At the end of October, Yeltsin decorates the television 
workers who have distinguished themselves in the events, 
including those from CNN. He acknowledges in public that they 
have done more for the country than all the democrats taken 
together. However, money for domestic RTV (radio, television) 
was nevertheless not found in the treasury. 
  Further--November. All of the electronic mass media are also 
waiting for money, but can by no means wait for it. Their debt 
is growing with every day. For the time being, the 
communications workers are forgiving [the debt], understanding 
that those who prevent the triumph of the new constitution were 
almost enemies in November. Of all the forces, radio and 
television twist the election campaign, unprecedented for 
Russia. Every day, the citizens hear that one or another figure 
who felt the urge for politics in his blood has rented 
COMMERCIAL hours and minutes on the screen and on the air. Only 
a little time will pass and it will turn out that those who had 
the urge have also not paid radio and television for the 
election campaign. 
  And here it is December. The whole world, in anticipation of 
Christmas, dances around the Christmas tree. We are dancing to 
different music: The government has stormed the parliament. It 
will never understand its debt to society, it is always fixed on 
the future, it promises the television chiefs that as soon as 
December 12 is over, we will assume all power and settle 
accounts, and we will go on, and everything will become 
splendid, and we will begin to live, will flourish, and the 
gardens will break into blossom. Alas, we have not started to 
live, and things turned out to the contrary. Those who promised 
did not seize power. Totally other people seized power. 
  And how do things stand with the money? Where is it? The 
money in the amount of 67 billion in the national Russian 
currency? It should already have been turned over to the 
communications workers without delay. . . . They are also 
people--those who sit in the Russian steppes and hills far away 
from the large cities and service the relay stations, which 
transmit the signal from one region to the other, from one 
antenna to the other. And there are many such people--alone the 
departmental settlements of the Ministry of Communications, 
which arose for the servicing of the relay stations, come to 
16,000 for Russia. And all the people there are without wages, 
and sometimes since the summer.... 
<H5>  Where Is the Money? The Money Is Where? </H5>
  I hope is in Gosbank, because it cannot but be there. But at 
the same time, I am afraid, it is not. And in the meantime 
January has passed. From the government, which was unable to see 
to it that budget money went where, in accordance with the law 
on the budget for 1993, it should go--from this government there 
remain only horns and legs. The guilty, as always, do not 
remain, since all the guilty turn into the aggrieved and, in 
accordance with Russian tradition, are not subject to further 
beating. Boris Fedorov--the former minister of finance, or, as 
it turned out, minister without finances and without rights to 
control these finances--it now appears had nothing to do with 
it. Sixteen thousand settlements continue to sit without money. 
Patience is being exhausted. The Ministry of Communications is 
trying to improve its situation at the expense of the 
weakest--for example, it is announcing price increases for its 
services for newspapers and journals, moreover such an increase 
that, if it takes place, the majority of them would die at once. 
The Ministry has calculated correctly and shrewdly: For 
newspapers the people today will already not go into the square, 
and it is not to be beaten to death, and even for a 
demonstration it cannot be assembled, these are no longer the 
times of Gorbachev. 
  But the journalists were able all the same to consolidate 
corporatively at that moment and some of them saved for 
themselves the old prices for the communications services. 
Although, of course, not for long. Another week passed by after 
the "good" papa-Chernomyrdin met with the indignant 
editors-in-chief of the leading publications and promised them 
to moderate the ardor of the commmunications workers, and peace 
for the newspaper all the same capsized: Quietly, without noise 
and ardor, the Ministry of Communications all the same raised 
the prices, but in a differentiated manner--for some threefold, 
for others fivefold, and still others tenfold. Thus, a mere 
branch ministry, nothing more, through economic methods effected 
a (political?) selection in the state. 
  And here February came flying. The debts for the signal as 
before were not paid. The communications workers are on the 
verge of a strike--they are not being paid their wages. Where 
are they to turn? They demand. They threaten, they remember that 
they have in their hands the very knife-switch which can 
extinguish both sound and light. They engage in blackmail, 
which, of course, is very shameful. But what is to be done? . . 
. A month earlier they were blackmailed. 
<H5>  The Hour `X' Is Announced </H5>
  If you don't settle the accounts, the communications workers 
scream, you will read books in the evening--and nothing else: 
Including prime ministers and janitors. Immediately before the 
discontinuation of television and radio transmissions, Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin urgently convenes a meeting. The architect 
of perestroyka, Aleksandr Yakovlev, recently appointed as chief 
of the Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, 
comes, the Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak comes, for 
some reason pulled hastily out of a polyclinic from tests. We 
are on fire, they say. Although, it is clear, we have been on 
fire for several months running. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin 
speaks his weighty state word at the meeting and promises to 
settle the accounts. He sent for Minister of Finance Dubinin. 
Although he knows very well that there is nothing to pay with at 
the moment. Minister Dubinin declares that he will not 
pay--there is no money, even if your life depends on it. Would 
there not be a question to put to Minister Dubinin, for what, 
they say, do you divide the money? But the prime minister takes 
a different road. 
  The prime minister hammers out a telegram to all the 
communications workers of Russia and in a fatherly manner asks 
them, for the umpteenth time, to put themselves into the 
position of the poverty-stricken state. He asks not to touch the 
knife-switch, to leave to the people simply Mary and all the 
inhabitants of Santa Barbara. The prime minister gets up on his 
knees, as if he is old. . . . This produces an impression: Some 
people feel sorry for him, here and there they do not touch the 
knife-switch, but here and there they nevertheless turn off the 
knife-switch, and there a panic begins. It seized even the 
northern capital--for a whole day St. Petersburg did not see and 
hear anything from Moscow, and many decided that again a social 
cataclysm had occurred. 
  The prime minister enters into a strict agreement with the 
minister of finance that the debts will be paid gradually during 
the first quarter. But this, too, is some kind of improbable 
oddity--for the time being, they are talking only about 
settlement of the accounts for the last year. Up to now they are 
not talking about the debts for January and February, which it 
was time to clear off long ago. 
<H5>  For What Are They Hoping THERE? </H5>
  This, perhaps, is the only question in this story which one 
does not even need to try to answer proceeding from the classic 
laws of logic. Finale. Realm of fantasy [zapredel]. Anarchy. 
There is no money to be had anywhere. However, they will 
nevertheless take it from somewhere. And in very large 
quantities. And not for the poverty-stricken service personnel 
of the relay stations, but for quite different purposes. In the 
evening of the same day when Chernomyrdin hammered out the 
telegram, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets visited Oleg 
Poptsov, head of VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and Radio 
Company], at Yamskoye Pole (Russian Channel). Why? They talk 
about various things. We will refer only to an, in our view, 
very correct opinion, because it belongs to a very interested 
person from among Poptsov's deputies. That evening they brought 
Mr Soskovets to Shabolovka, where the old historical television 
center is located, which the Russian Channel acquired some time 
ago. They showed Soskovets the unfinished building, and an oral 
agreement was reached to the effect that VGTRK, Poptsov's 
fiefdom, above all, falls under the patronage, and this means, 
the financing of the Russian government. But, you see, they 
screamed that there is a financial abyss, and they shed tears. . 
. . However, it is necessary to understand that these will be 
enormous expenditures for the budget, comparable even with the 
dollars which they threatened to throw at the new palace for the 
new deputies. And in order for it to be built in accordance with 
the latest state of technology, as Soskovets and Poptsov agreed! 
And in order for the installations to be like those at CNN! We 
would very much like to know this. Again precisely budget 
matters. 
  Up to now only one of the points of such financing is clear: 
The government apparently decided to stop fattening "Ostankino" 
and to finance only its information service, and to give all the 
remaining time to the [air] waves of private business--in the 
disposition of independent television studios and companies. 
Strictly speaking, this is not a bad thing and remarkable; what 
arouses attention is only the fact that the government for the 
umpteenth time has forgotten to consult with the taxpayers, who 
are directly involved in the formation of budget funds. 
<H5>  Again About Totalitarianism </H5>
  It, the accursed demon, is directly related to this story, 
too. The point is that those very relay stations with which the 
communications workers are blackmailing in order to receive what 
is theirs are the most essential stronghold of totalitarianism. 
  It turned out that the civilized world already for a long 
time watches television and listens to radio without any 
"fools," it has no need for settlements abandoned a little 
farther from human habitation. The world uses satellites. This 
has proved to be more ecological and incomparably cheaper than 
the daily servicing of relay stations. A satellite is only 
expensive to make and to launch, then everything is simpler. But 
in the USSR, as is well known, they did not think about 
cheapness, and even less about ecology, they talked about the 
fact that everything must be listened to that can be listened 
to, and that everything must be suppressed that should be 
suppressed out of ideological considerations. The archaic relay 
stations, which during the time of the Soviets went through more 
for the KGB agency than for any other and which now require such 
financial infusions as not a single modern television company 
would dream of, precisely corresponded to the system of total 
control of the conscience of people. 
  In connection with what has been set forth above, the next 
question arises: Perhaps, all of us will have to pull ourselves 
together, Mr Chernomyrdin, one last time, and launch the 
necessary number of satellites, in order for us to have 
everything like people [elsewhere], in order for 16,000 
settlements, like the repressed, not to complain in the windy 
steppes, and in order for the future to be without relay 
stations? I would very much like to hear an answer.

<F P=106> [Article by Rais Tuzmukhamedov and Vladimir Pustogarov, </F>
doctors of legal sciences, under rubric "Opinion": "Victory, 
Divided Equally: Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Tatarstan as an Act of International Law"] 
  [Text] The date of 15 February 1994 became a landmark in 
the history of relations between Moscow and Kazan, since, for 
the first time since Russia seized the Kazan khanate in the 
middle of the sixteenth century, a treaty was concluded between 
the new RF [Russian Federation] and the new RT [Republic of 
Tatarstan], a treaty that was based, as is stated in its 
preamble, on "the generally recognized right of nations to 
self-determination, on principles of the completely equal and 
voluntary expression of free will." 
  This treaty is a compromise, just as any agreement is, 
whether it be in everyday life, at the domestic state level, or 
in international relations. But it is a compromise that 
preserves the sovereignty of both sides. They have divided, in a 
sovereign manner, the powers in a new unification. Inasmuch as, 
according to Minister Sergey Shakhray, one of the chief 
representatives of the Russian side, as quoted in a ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA interview, "the methodology of the Federative Treaty 
formed the basis of the document," we shall refer to that act 
and compare what was put in whose jurisdiction by that act. 
  A number of areas of behavior, including some extremely 
important ones, that were ascribed in the Federative Treaty to 
the sphere of the joint jurisdiction of the Center and the 
subjects of the Federation have now been firmly established as 
being within the exclusive, that is, sovereign, jurisdiction of 
Tatarstan. They include, for example, "questions of the 
possession, use, and disposal of the land, mineral wealth, the 
water, timber, and other natural resources, as well as the state 
enterprises, organizations, and other movable and immovable 
property situated on the territory of the Republic of 
Tatarstan." We might note, incidentally, an extremely important 
principle that has been established: the topic being discussed 
is the "exclusive property owned by the people of Tatarstan," 
rather than "by the state" (read: the state bureaucracy), as is 
frequently written in RF acts. 
  According to the Treaty, Tatarstan itself has the right to 
resolve questions of the bar and notary practices, and to carry 
out the legal regulation of administrative, family, and housing 
relations, and relations in the area of environmental protection 
and use of natural resources. Tatarstan itself establishes the 
system of the republic's state agencies, and the procedure for 
organizing them and for carrying out their activities. Like any 
other sovereign state, Tatarstan itself resolves questions of 
republic citizenship. The republic itself forms its budget, 
establishes and collects taxes, and independently carries out 
foreign-economic activity; resolves questions of conversion at 
enterprises that are part of the republic's state property; 
creates the National Bank; concludes agreements with foreign 
states; participates in international organizations; etc. These 
and other exclusive powers and sovereign rights correspond to 
the Tatarstan Constitution, which has firmly established the 
state sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  It is fundamentally important that the documents that are 
recognized as the legal basis of the treaty are the 
constitutions of both states. Legally this means not only the 
paramount importance and the priority of the norms and 
principles of the two constitutions and of each of them, but 
also the fact that, when interpreting the treaty, each side 
primarily proceeds from its own Constitution and coordinates its 
point of view with the Constitution of the other participant in 
the Treaty. 
  For those who, in 1991, adopted the Declaration of the State 
Sovereignty of Tatarstan, who, in March 1992, in a referendum 
voted for the republic's sovereignty, and who subsequently, on 
the basis of that referendum, developed and adopted, in November 
1992, the Constitution of the sovereign state of Tatarstan, 
something that must be of substantial importance is the fact 
that the treaty, as is stated in its preamble, is the 
"completely equal unification of two states," and that this 
unification occurred on the basis of the constitutions both of 
Russia and Tatarstan, as well as the principles enumerated in 
the treaty itself. The treaty is an agreement between sovereign 
states and the subjects of international law. This is not stated 
in the text. But that essence of the act is self-evident, 
primarily on the basis of the sense of the name and text of the 
agreement. It is called: "Treaty Between the Russian Federation 
and the Republic of Tatarstan." That means an agreement between 
two sovereign states (Article 1 in both constitutions). This is 
also mentioned in the preamble, where it is directly stated that 
the Republic of Tatarstan unites with the Russian Federation "as 
a state." 
  Furthermore, the treaty was signed at the highest level -- 
by 
chiefs of state. The sovereignty of the contracting parties as 
entities in international law is also attested to by the subject 
of the agreement. It pertains to the delimitation of the 
authoritative powers, that is, the powers that are inherent in 
state sovereignty, since sovereignty is a category of authority. 
  The fact that the treaty is an act in international law, 
that 
is, an agreement between two subjects of international law, also 
evolves completely obviously from the fact the contracting 
parties indicated as their legal basis their own constitutions 
--each of them unambiguously established the quality of a 
sovereign state that is based on the sovereignty of the 
multiethnic people of those countries (Articles 1 and 3 of the 
RF Constitution; preamble and Articles 1, 2, and 61 of the RT 
Constitution). 
  Sergey Shakhray, RF minister of nationalities and regional 
policy, stated in the interview that was previously mentioned 
that "this treaty is not subject to ratification, in order not 
to create the illusion of being a document in international 
law." But ratification is a completely unmandatory attribute of 
the nature of the treaty as a document in international law. 
This depends upon how the contracting parties come to an 
understanding. Another matter is that the treaty distributes the 
sovereign powers within the framework of the unification of the 
two contracting parties that is created by them. 
  Sergey Shakhray said, "From the point of view of 
international law and state law, this (the signing of the treaty 
and Tatarstan's consent to participate in elections to the 
Federal Assembly) means the recognition of the federal electoral 
law and sovereignty of Russia." If the minister, by his use of 
the word "recognition," means not the assertion of the existence 
of Russia's sovereignty, but the subordination of Tatarstan to 
the sovereignty of the RF, then the very preamble of the treaty 
begins with words to the effect that the contracting parties are 
guided not only by the RF Constitution, but also equally by the 
RT Constitution, and that they are proceeding from the 
"generally recognized right of nations to self-determination, on 
principles of the completely equal and voluntary expression of 
free will", etc. Incidentally, the nation of Tatarstan also 
expressed its self-determination unambiguously not only in March 
1992, but also during the April 1993 referendum and during the 
referendum on the new RF Constitution. 
  Gavriil Popov and Fedor Burlatskiy, in a Dialogue broadcast 
on 19 February, did justice to the political wisdom of President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev and the endurance of President Boris Yeltsin, 
who justly divided the victory (it is only in such an instance 
that it is indeed a victory) equally between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  Finally, we would like to direct attention to the fact that 
the Treaty text contains four references to agreements between 
the contracting parties. As is well known, there are more than 
ten of them. It must be assumed that these agreements will also 
become accessible to the public. That would help to make a 
better evaluation of the historical nature of the role and 
limits of the importance of a treaty that is so important for 
Russia and Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Taran: "The Stockholders of Tatpromstroybank </F>
Did Not Miscalculate"] 
  [Text] The news that the joint-stock industrial 
construction bank of development of the Republic of Tatarstan 
(Tatpromstroybank) was among the top 100 banks of Russia for the 
second time in a row (it is the only representative of Tatarstan 
financial institutions on the rating chart) arrived just in 
time--a conference of the stockholders of Tatpromstroybank 
convened yesterday at which the results of last year's operation 
were summarized and reference points for the current year were 
charted. 
  Rafael Mingazov, chairman of the bank's board of directors, 
had no reason to be ashamed in front of the founders and 
stockholders when presenting his report on the work 
accomplished. The bank's balance sheet turnover, total assets, 
and credit deposits increased fivefold. While bank profits grew 
twice as fast as the volume of credit extension, increasing by a 
factor of 11. In the words of R. Mingazov, the bank succeeded in 
achieving this primarily by accelerating monetary turnover, not 
by setting high rates for credit. 
  The reliability and prestige of Tatpromstroybank is 
confirmed 
by the fact that more than 2,000 enterprises and entrepreneurs 
became its clients last year and 17,000 individuals became 
depositors. 
  As we know, it was decided at the previous stockholder 
conference to increase the bank's authorized capital to R1.5 
billion. In July of last year this task was accomplished, and 
towards the end of 1993 the authorized capital of 
Tatpromstroybank had grown to R3 billion. The bank directors 
have proposed to the stockholders that the level of authorized 
capital be raised to R10 billion, especially since the Russian 
Federation Central Bank adopted a resolution establishing the 
minimum amount of capital at R2 billion, to be increased over 
the course of five years to R10 billion. 
  Tatpromstroybank's borrowers are predominantly state 
enterprises. They account for more than 63 percent of the 
credits, mainly short-term credits. Long-term credits increased 
fourfold in terms of absolute amount, but their rate of growth 
decreased. This is explained by virtue of the overall crisis in 
the economy and the striving of bank directors to accelerate the 
turnover rate of resources. The share of long-term credits was 
reduced from 10 to 7 percent. 
  Nonetheless, R. Mingazov states that the bank saddled itself 
with obligations to distribute long-term resources for providing 
credits to the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant and defense 
enterprises amounting to over R12 billion. The bank's income 
from these transactions is entirely minimal, however--3 percent 
annual interest. 
  In order to soften the blow inflicted upon enterprises by 
the 
nonpayments crisis, Tatpromstroybank has established direct 
corresponding accounts with 16 banks of the near abroad and 15 
of the far abroad, which include financial enterprises of the 
United States, Germany, England, Switzerland, Turkey, and Korea. 
In order to regulate the use of ready cash in 1994, it is 
planned to introduce plastic cards for obtaining cash through 
automatic teller machines.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Ganeyeva: "More Millionaires Every Day"] </F>
  [Text] Privatization of housing in Kazan began three months 
ago. Over the elapsed time, this mechanism has been fine-tuned 
and now is working almost without a glitch. The city authorities 
have managed over an extremely short period of time to put 
together a legislative base--the basis for the conduct of 
privatization; to set up a powerful computer network linked to 
the main computer in the city agency for housing privatization, 
which gave the city the necessary information on the process of 
transferring housing to private hands. The agency, created at 
the end of November of last year, practically began its 
operation at the time that housing privatization got its 
start--on 6 December. 
  According to the agency's data, which were provided to us by 
its chief, Yevgeniy Tokarchuk, as of 5 March 4,430 apartments 
had been privatized in Kazan, which comprises 3.5 percent of all 
city housing subject to privatization by law. In Kazan's 
Baumanskiy Rayon, 273 persons received contracts transferring 
housing to private ownership; in Sovetskiy Rayon--1,083, 
Vakhitovskiy--572, Privolzhskiy--956, Moskovskiy--934, 
Leninskiy--1,220, and Kirovskiy--368. 
  More than 9,500 applications for housing privatization 
already have been submitted. Now in the housing maintenance 
organizations, waiting for its owners who apparently had not 
expected to get all [lines missing]. 
  Instead of the period of one month envisaged by the law for 
a 
contract to be issued after the application is submitted, in 
Baumanskiy, Sovetskiy, and Moskovskiy Rayons the processing 
period for housing privatization documents has been reduced to 
10 or at most 16 days. In Leninskiy and Privolzhskiy Rayons, 
however, which are experiencing some computer problems, 
contracts are issued a month after the application is submitted. 
  Time begets new problems: refusal to privatize after the 
contract has already been processed. People had submitted 
applications to housing maintenance offices, and then changed 
their mind. Ye. Tokarchuk's comment on this situation was that 
they explain their change of mind by open threats of extortion. 
For instance, quarrels have already begun in some families, and 
canceling the contract in this situation is the best way out of 
the situation. Quite possibly, some of soon to be property 
owners have run into those who already own it and have realized 
that it is better at this point to keep living in a state-owned 
apartment. 
  The pace of housing privatization in the city has 
stabilized. 
Looking at the December data, at the time more than 1,000 
applications a week were coming in; in January, the number 
dropped to 800, and in February--600 a week. According to the 
latest data from the agency, now about 650-700 applications are 
coming in every week. Ye. Tokarchuk noted that city residents 
are not well informed on the terms, rules, and advantages of 
housing privatization. People ask the most elementary questions. 
The most often asked is whether they may have to pay more for a 
privatized apartment. 
  "We have to explain patiently that payments for a privatized 
apartment remain the same," Ye. Tokarchuk tells us, "while the 
property tax amounts to only 0.1 percent of the book value of 
the cost of the housing as of 1 January 1994; that the tax is 
paid once a year in November-December, and inflation will make 
the amount of the tax rather modest. Besides, some categories of 
citizens are exempt from property taxes altogether." 
  Many questions are asked regarding residence permits as 
applied to privatized housing. People ask about the procedures 
of willing apartments as inheritance, giving them as a gift, and 
buying and selling. 
  Generally, however, the city agency's main tasks are not in 
answering people's questions. The agency represents the main 
link in the chain of housing privatization departments under 
heads of rayon administrations; it has been set up under the 
head of the Kazan administration. [Line missing] of 
privatization is computerized. One of the agency's main 
functions is to monitor compliance with the law. The main 
computer located at the agency checks whether the housing unit 
indicated in the application is subject to privatization. As is 
known, it is against the law to take possession of decrepit 
housing or housing assigned as part of one's official position. 
There are restrictions on apartment privatization in buildings 
that represent historic and architectural landmarks. The 
dispassionate machine also picks up facts of multiple residence 
permits and repeat privatization by the same person. 
  The main computer also assigns a registration number to all 
contracts transferring housing into private ownership. Each 
rayon has its own code, but the city keeps its own integrated 
registration. Therefore, the registration number consists of a 
code and a sequential number. 
  In addition, the agency monitors the work schedule and 
operations of housing maintenance offices and rayon housing 
privatization departments and conducts planned weekly audits. 
  As to the concrete results of the city agency's work, over 
these three months three incidents of multiple residence permits 
have been detected, and several precedents of attempts to 
privatize housing that by law is not subject to privatization. 
The privatization applications of all these persons were 
rejected. 
  According to fresh statistical data received in the agency 
through the computer network, local soviets' housing comprises 
65.9 percent of all privatized housing, and 34.1 
percent--housing previously owned by organizations. The city 
authorities had quite a few unpleasant moments dealing with 
reluctance and open sabotage on the part of enterprises that did 
not want to relinquish their housing to ownership of the people 
living in it. Now the situation has improved perceptibly, and 
enterprises that attempt at all costs to make their housing a 
part of their charter capital are few and far between. They have 
managed, however, to slow down privatization of enterprise-owned 
housing, which accounts for a lower share of such housing as 
compared to one owned by local soviets. 
  The main computer has a full picture of the attributes of 
the 
privatized housing. One-room apartments account for the greatest 
share of privatized housing (44.3 percent), followed closely by 
two-room apartments (37.6 percent), then three-room 
apartments--14.9 percent, and rooms in communal apartments--3.2 
percent. 
  [Lines missing] cases become single or elderly people. Our 
state has deprived our elderly of the opportunity of leaving 
inheritance in a deposit book. Their life savings--3,000-5,000 
rubles--have lost their value completely. Now, however, they 
have the opportunity to leave a million-ruble inheritance--an 
apartment-- and the elderly want to take advantage of this right. 
  According to Ye. Tokarchuk, the results of analysis 
conducted 
by the service show that 3.5 percent of housing has now been 
privatized in Kazan; by the end of the year it will reach 
approximately 20 percent. In Russia during the first year also 
10-12 percent of housing had been transferred to private 
ownership; now it is between 30 and 50 percent, depending on the 
region. 
  So far, housing privatization is proceeding here in the same 
way as in Russia, and only a few of us have had the chance to 
appreciate fully the right to own housing. However, a market in 
apartments is already emerging in the city, where enormous 
prices per square meter will lift the mood of owners of Kazan 
real estate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Z. Nakhushev, by I. Mezova, under rubric </F>
"Politics": "Zaurbi Nakhushev: It's No Easy Life for the 
Speaker...: Interview With the Chairman of the Council of the 
Republic, of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Parliament"] 
  [Text] [Mezova] Well, Zaurbi Akhmedovich, like the Council 
of the Republic, which you head, Parliament has been working for 
one and a half months. That's a short period of time, but 
certainly something has already been done. Precisely what? 
  [Nakhushev] We were elected as deputies on 12 December, but 
have been working less than a month. That is linked basically 
with installing Parliament. Naturally, not much has been done so 
far. We are basically working for ourselves: we adopted 
Provisional Regulations, confirmed the makeup of commissions, 
and elected their chairmen. There is also another important 
document in our assets: KBR Law entitled "The Making of 
Amendments and Additions to the KBR Constitution (Basic Law)." 
The plan for the legislative activity of the Council of the 
Republic for the next two months is almost ready, so the house 
is approaching the finishing line for creating legislation. 
  Within the near future a commission to develop the draft of 
the KBR Constitution will be created. It would be a rather good 
idea to publish the draft in October in the mass media, and 
then, in November-December, to submit it for review by 
parliament. We are also engaged in preparing the republic's 
symbols -- the seal, anthem, and flag. We already have final 
versions of the seal and flag for submittal to the President. 
  [Mezova] As an invited individual, you were present at the 
first session of the Council of the Federation. What were your 
impressions? 
  [Nakhushev] Yes, for two days I was at sessions of the 
Council of the Federation. To tell the truth, it did not seem to 
me that discussions about the fact that the Council of the 
Federation is Boris Yeltsin's agency have sufficient foundation. 
The people who gathered in the house were the administrators of 
major enterprises in the defense industry, administration heads 
of krays and oblasts, Presidents, and well-known academicians -- 
in general, people who can make their own judgments with regard 
to all questions pertaining to the vital activity of the Russian 
state, people who are strong personalities, professionally 
speaking. The fact that Shumeyko headed the Council of the 
Federation has a positive role. The house immediately went to 
work. Also, he has an excellent knowledge of the government's 
kitchen, so to speak, from the inside. It will be easier to 
cooperate with him. 
  [Mezova] Everyone says that the reforms will be rolled up. 
Is 
that correct? 
  [Nakhushev] He (Vladimir Shumeyko) has stated frankly that 
we 
need supporters of the reforms that are being carried out by the 
government. In general, one thing is clear: the interaction 
between the Council of the Federation and the government will be 
good and stable. 
  [Mezova] Since we have touched upon this topic, you 
apparently know that both the RF [Russian Federation] Parliament 
and the KBR are predicting the fate of the pocket parliament. 
What do you think such suppositions are based on? What is your 
attitude toward them? 
  [Nakhushev] I have already said that the Council of the 
Federation produced a favorable impression on me. It seems to me 
that it will scarcely be a pocket parliament. Its makeup 
includes deputies who are rather independent and strong. 
  Nevertheless I agree that they definitely are predicting. 
These discussions are occurring and probably contain a share of 
truth. But still the present Parliament is really not the 
Supreme Soviet, which used to engage in all state matters, and 
sometimes also usurped the functions of the executive power. It 
seems to me that these discussions are based on the fact that 
there has been a fundamental change in the functions and powers 
of the representative authority. Parliament will engage in the 
creation of legislation. It has retained the function of 
monitoring the execution of the laws and the executive power. In 
particular, it possesses powers concerning the expression of 
confidence or lack of confidence in Parliament. The budget is 
also in the joint jurisdiction of the houses. 
  [Mezova] Are you saddened that Parliament's powers have been 
narrowed? 
  [Nakhushev] In the broad sense Parliament actually does not 
possess the previous completeness of power. But that is what the 
division of powers is. Currently it is simply that people have 
not yet become accustomed to this, but in two or three years, I 
am convinced, this situation will not surprise anyone. 
  Yes, we actually have been limited to a definite framework. 
Nevertheless, the Council of the Republic, like Parliament as a 
whole, will not be a pocket organization. I do not think that 
anyone, including the President, has an interest in this. We do 
not intend to cause any frictions in the interrelations with the 
other authorities. Each has its own functions and its own duties. 
  [Mezova] You probably are already rather well acquainted 
with 
the deputies in your house. Are you pleased with the makeup of 
the house? What would you change if that depended on you? What 
kind of specialists (or individuals) would you prefer to have 
more of in the Council of the Republic? 
  [Nakhushev] I cannot say that this acquaintance is as 
profound or complete as I would like, but I am satisfied with 
the deputy corps. People of different ages, with different 
knowledge and work experience, are represented in it. There are 
lawyers, entrepreneurs, three former school directors... I view 
their working ability optimistically. I hope that in a year our 
deputies who are working on a professional basis will actually 
become professionals. If, of course, we work... 
  [Mezova] Do you mean that Parliament might be broken up or 
disbanded?.. 
  [Nakhushev] No, no. If we work on ourselves. 
  [Mezova] In the house there actually are people who evoke 
curiosity. But am I correct in saying that it does not contain, 
for example, any clearly expressed radicals? 
  [Nakhushev] Apparently not. But I am completely happy with 
this makeup, although we do not have any people who are as well 
known in the republic as the Council of Representatives has. 
However, we do have people who are very interesting, and who 
evoke, as you have said, genuine curiosity. 
  [Mezova] In general, how do you imagine the ideal 
parliamentarian? Do you see him in any concrete way -- in the 
present makeup of the Parliament or the former VS [Supreme 
Soviet], the present or former Parliament of the RF, or even the 
USSR? 
  [Nakhushev] I am not confident that I am speaking about the 
finished image of the ideal parliamentarian, but, in my view, he 
is a restrained individual, who is very tactful and highly 
cultivated. It is not mandatory that he have several higher 
degrees. But he must also be consistent, competent, and be able 
to speak laconically and expressively. He must be a democrat in 
the true sense of the word, and an aristocrat at heart. 
Incidentally, in our house I see several persons who promise to 
become this kind of parliamentarian in the future. 
  [Mezova] Could you name them? 
  [Nakhushev] I shall not anticipate events. Nor shall I name 
real ones who have already distinguished themselves. Although, 
to tell the truth, I was not enraptured either by Sobchak or 
Popov, or even Sakharov, even at those times when everyone was 
delighted by them. At first I was irritated even by Yevdokiya 
Gayer. Do you remember that small woman? Then I learned to 
respect her, because it was obvious that she was speaking in a 
meaningful way and was genuinely experiencing what she was 
talking about and what she felt for her people. 
  [Mezova] There have been a lot of discussions about the 
powers assigned to the houses. For example, certain deputies of 
the Council of Representatives assume that it would make sense 
to return to a division of them. What do you think? Which powers 
that are, in your opinion, the prerogative of the Council of the 
Republic have gone to the other house, or vice versa? 
  [Nakhushev] When each deputy was elected, he knew about his 
powers according to the Statute that had been confirmed by the 
President of the republic. Each one know where he would be going 
and what he would engage in. Today people cannot engage in 
pulling the blankets over themselves. God willing, each one will 
be able to cope with his powers. I feel that our house has not 
been insulted by anyone. We have even shared a lot of them with 
the Council of Representatives with regard to confidence or lack 
of confidence in the Government. We also discuss the budget 
jointly. We have the responsibility for its initial review. 
There have been recommendations concerning the creation of joint 
commissions. They are, of course, necessary, but not too many of 
them. Why, then, was it necessary to divide parliament into two 
houses? Especially since that house is operating on an 
unrelieved basis, and it will not be convenient to convoke them 
each time. Everyone, so to speak, has his job to do, so let each 
person pull his own wagon honestly. 
  [Mezova] People say that the parliament is being specially 
evicted from Government House allegedly to emphasize that the 
representative power is currently out of favor and is no match 
for the executive power. How would you comment of that? 
  [Nakhushev] First, no one is evicting us. Second, I do not 
know that it is mandatory anywhere for the powers to be situated 
together. I do not think that it is worse for Parliament to have 
its own accommodations... 
  [Mezova] Rather nice... 
  [Nakhushev] If not fashionable. The building that housed the 
former Nalchik Gorkom of the CPSU, and that is being offered to 
us, is the second building in prestige after Government House. 
True, it will be slightly crowded for Parliament, and therefore 
a plan for expanding the building has been prepared. 
  As for whether or not the representative power is a match 
for 
the executive, I have already said earlier that everyone should 
engage in his own job, and the better he performs it, the more 
everyone wins. 
  [Mezova] The British Parliament, which is the ancestor of 
many parliamentary traditions, also gave birth to the job of 
speaker, which is already more than 600 years old. At first the 
speaker acted there in the role of the mouthpiece of the House 
of Commons. His basic purpose was to regulate order in 
conducting debates and in guaranteeing justice. In our 
conditions the speaker is assigned several other powers. What do 
you think they should consist of? 
  [Nakhushev] I shall answer your question this way: the role 
of the speaker today is identical to the role of Parliament, and 
we have already touched upon that topic. Another important 
factor is the specifics that pertain to our republic. In 
general, at the present time, having worked a certain period of 
time, I can say that it's no easy life for the speaker, just as, 
incidentally, it's no easy life for the deputy. 
  [Mezova] Do you think that the two houses of the KBR 
Parliament will maintain stable, even, professional 
interrelations? 
  [Nakhushev] I feel that we have nothing to divide. Our tasks 
have been defined, and now it's simply a matter of executing 
them. Each house has been given its powers. The two chairmen are 
equal and independent of each other. I repeat that there will 
not be any frictions. We shall not allow them. 
  [Mezova] What kind of house would you like to see in a year 
or two? A professional one? 
  [Nakhushev] A professional one that is self-assured. This 
also pertains to the chairman. I think that we shall grow 
together. 
  [Mezova] Just yesterday, speaking figuratively, you were not 
the last person in the system of the executive power. But today 
that power allows itself to look at you condescendingly. Doesn't 
this offend you? Can you say that you have won by changing your 
place of work? 
  [Nakhushev] It surprises and... yes, it offends me. But, you 
know, I am not the kind of person who allows others to look at 
him condescendingly. I will growl, but if that becomes part of 
the system, I will simply leave... 
  To tell the truth, I do not know whether or not I won as a 
result of the new job. Time will tell...

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Ismelovich Abazov, procurator of </F>
Kabardino-Balkar Republic, by Z. Goplachev; date and place not 
given: "The Vigilance of the Procurator's Eye"] 
  [Text] January and February are the time for summing 
up the results of the previous year, including results in law 
enforcement agencies. The results of 1993 were summed up by the 
republic procuracy. 
  There was a thorough discussion of the procurators' 
performance in overseeing the enforcement of laws and securing 
the primacy of laws, the socioeconomic liberties of citizens, 
and the rights of the republic. Attention was focused on 
shortcomings in the work, unsolved problems, and the means of 
solving them. 
  Procurator R.I. Abazov of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic 
was interviewed a few days ago. 
  [Goplachev] Ruslan Ismelovich, attempts to evaluate the 
performance of law enforcement agencies in quantitative terms 
usually produce comparatively objective results. What can you 
tell us about some of the results of the past year, using these 
evaluations as a basis? 
  [Abazov] I want to start with the following comment. 
Everyone 
still remembers the tragic events of last year. These events, 
which were caused by the confrontation between two branches of 
the federal government, certainly could have moved to the 
regional level. In our republic this was averted by the efforts 
of our leaders and the wisdom of the people living here. Now I 
will answer your question in more specific terms. 
  Procurators discovered 860 violations, challenged 289 
unlawful legal instruments, and filed 251 reports for the 
elimination of these violations. They instituted 535 suits for 
380 million rubles on behalf of state and public organizations 
and institutions. 
  [Goplachev] There is valid public concern about the rising 
crime rate in the economic sphere. I have a question about three 
aspects of this: the protection of state property and the 
violations committed during privatization and in foreign 
economic activity. 
  [Abazov] Equipment, vehicles, and other assets worth tens of 
millions of rubles fell into the hands of private firms and 
small enterprises as a result of the negligence of some 
administrators in maintaining state property and the late 
discovery of these incidents by municipal and rayon procurators. 
Cases of this were discovered at the Kabbalkproyektstroy 
Association, the Baksan Consumer Goods Combine, the Terskiy Meat 
and Dairy Product Combine, and other enterprises. Measures are 
being taken now to recover the illegally acquired state 
property. Procurators conducted 27 inspections of compliance 
with state and private property laws, discovered 118 violations, 
and filed 15 reports. 
  The inspection of compliance in the sphere of privatization 
was extremely productive. Although the republic managed to avoid 
"wholesale" privatization, around 30 violations were found and 
18 reports were filed. 
  Decisions on the sale of state property or other forms of 
traffic in this property were frequently made without going 
through the proper channels. Municipal and rayon procurators did 
not have the necessary information about the state of legality 
in this sphere and could not influence the activities of the 
rayon committee for the management of state property in 
sufficiently effective ways. 
  A comprehensive inspection in an area as new to us as 
foreign 
economic activity produced positive results. We were able to 
draft specific proposals to improve the mechanism of foreign 
economic operations. Many enterprises and organizations engaged 
in this activity are not pursuing the goals that were set when 
they were founded: the attraction of advanced technology to the 
republic economy and the provision of the consumer market with 
adequate supplies of goods. The overwhelming majority of joint 
ventures and private firms are conducting trade and foreign 
economic operations not on a permanent and concrete basis, but 
in sporadic barter transactions, frequently ignoring the 
applicable limits imposed on export and interregional deliveries 
by authorized agencies, including the procuracy. 
  [Goplachev] How would you rate the state of republic 
agriculture? 
  [Abazov] The state of affairs in the republic agroindustrial 
complex is seriously disturbing. The theft and loss of products 
and the harvest are still widespread. Just last year around 
9,000 head of cattle in the republic died or were stolen. Farms 
in Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, Chegemskiy, Urvanskiy, and 
Prokhladnenskiy rayons suffered the most damage. The measures 
procurators took were far from adequate: Only 37 suits for 1.5 
million rubles in compensation were instituted for the dead 
cattle. 
  [Goplachev] How effective has procuracy intervention been in 
preventing violations of social laws? 
  [Abazov] Inspections revealed flagrant violations in the 
distribution of housing and telephones in Nalchik. The municipal 
procuracy knew about these cases but confined its response to 
filed reports. It was not until the republic procuracy 
intervened that suits were instituted to invalidate orders and 
evict citizens from illegally occupied apartments. The republic 
procuracy lodged the necessary protests with the Nalchik 
municipal administration, and dozens of citizens lost their 
illegally installed telephones. 
  [Goplachev] How are things with regard to felonies? 
  [Abazov] Regrettably, I have nothing good to report to the 
readers of KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA. Although the overall 
crime rate was relatively stable (0.6 percent below the 1992 
figure), there has been an increase in felonies in the republic, 
including homicide (+57.4 percent), the intentional infliction 
of serious bodily injury (+18.6 percent), rape and attempted 
rape (+60.5 percent), mugging (+55.6 percent), and vandalism 
(+52.2 percent). The number of these crimes has risen in all 
cities and rayons in the republic. They now account for 17.9 
percent of all crimes. 
  In all, 7,681 crimes were reported in the republic. An 
increase in crime was recorded in Prokhladnenskiy, Terskiy, 
Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, and Sovetskiy rayons. 
  Last year was marked by an unprecedented rise in the 
homicide 
rate (from 61 to 96 cases). Furthermore, one out of every three 
has not been solved. 
  The number of homicides increased most dramatically in 
Nalchik--from 19 to 42 (+121 percent); 17 of these, or 40.4 
percent, have not been solved. There were more homicides in 
Terskiy, Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, Zolskiy, and Sovetskiy 
rayons. 
  The rise (73.1 percent) in the number of crimes committed 
with the use of loaded firearms (one out of every three 
homicides) is particularly disturbing. The weapons generally 
come from outside Kabardino-Balkaria, which still has 
"transparent" borders, despite the presence of checkpoints on 
access roads from adjacent territories. 
  [Goplachev] How vigilant is the procurator's eye in 
discovering wrongful dismissals of criminal cases? 
  [Abazov] Last year procurators discovered 135 crimes which 
were removed from police records by the issuance of unlawful 
decisions to drop criminal charges. Procurators filed 173 
reports on the violations, leading to disciplinary actions 
against 109 officials. The oversight of criminal cases by the 
procuracy, however, was also inadequate. This is attested to by 
the increasing number of dismissed cases. Procuracy personnel 
dismissed 30.4 percent of all cases. This is an impermissible 
luxury. 
  [Goplachev] Children are also involved in crime.... 
  [Abazov] The overall rate of juvenile crime has decreased by 
5 percent. There was an increase in Nalchik and in 
Prokhladnenskiy, Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, and Chegemskiy rayons. 
There are still too many cases in which juveniles are framed for 
crimes. A case in Nalchik is a good example: When the 9-year-old 
Karatsukov was "railroaded" for 10 thefts of personal property, 
including such items as a television set, a rug measuring 3 x 4 
meters, and a crate of champagne, no one even wondered how this 
"miscreant" could have carried these items. 
  [Goplachev] The procuracy presses charges, and the criminal 
is convicted. Then what happens? 
  [Abazov] The punishment is usually left up to the courts, 
but 
the penalty is not always administered in a timely or 
satisfactory manner, and laws are sometimes broken during this 
phase. The group overseeing corrective labor institutions and 
the procurators conducted 87 inspections and filed 33 reports on 
the results. There are still numerous violations of prisoners' 
rights in camps No 1 and No 3, leading to the commission of 
crimes, and the absence of work precludes corrective labor. 
  There was an excessively formal approach to the oversight of 
the activities of the corrective labor institutions department 
of the republic Ministry of Internal Affairs, where standards 
were relaxed and other violations were committed. These led to 
the mass disturbances in March. Then the case of the suspect who 
had been held illegally for eight months came to light in 
December. The procuracy lodged a protest and the guilty parties 
were punished. 
  [Goplachev] Did the economic reform affect your work? 
  [Abazov] The intensification of economic reform and the 
democratic changes in the society transferred the protection of 
the interests of economic entities and the majority of civil 
rights to the jurisdiction of arbitration boards and people's 
courts, increasing their workload and, consequently, the 
possibility of judicial error. 
  This called for intense work by the Division of Civil Suit 
Oversight and by local procurators. The effectiveness of the 
appeals process to protest unlawful rulings was improved 
slightly. 
  [Goplachev] Is the procuracy involved in the exoneration of 
victims of political repression? 
  [Abazov] In accordance with the requirements of the Law "On 
the Exoneration of Victims of Political Repression," the 
republic procuracy has worked with security and internal affairs 
agencies to restore the reputation of innocent victims. The 
files of 422 people were reviewed. Decisions on exoneration were 
made in 289 cases. The majority of exoneration orders have not 
been delivered yet, however, and have not been requested, 
despite the coverage of the review of these cases on radio and 
television and in the press. 
  [Goplachev] What can you tell us about your personnel 
problems? 
  [Abazov] Six of the ten municipal and rayon procurators are 
serving their second constitutional term. Last year three staff 
members of procuracy agencies were elected to the republic 
Constitutional Court and two were elected to the 
Kabardino-Balkar Parliament. We are proud of this. Ten staffers 
were promoted to higher offices after their performance 
evaluations. 
  I would like to discuss two extremely important personnel 
problems we cannot solve without considerable assistance from 
the republic leadership and the Procuracy General. One is the 
urgent need for a new building or new premises for the republic 
procuracy, because our staff is several times the size it was 
when our present building was designed. Besides this, our staff 
was increased by another 23 positions in the new year. The 
distinctive features of our work, particularly our investigative 
work, require each inspector to have an office of his own, but 
our present offices have to be shared by two or three people. 
Meanwhile, the Nalchik municipal procuracy does not even have a 
building of its own and half of its staff has to do its work in 
a residential building. We also have no facility for meetings of 
the whole staff. 
  Problems in securing housing for procuracy personnel have 
not 
been solved either, especially in the city of Nalchik. The Law 
"On the Procuracy in the Russian Federation" says that the local 
administration must supply procuracy personnel requiring better 
living conditions with the appropriate living area as soon as 
possible, or within six months in the case of newly appointed 
personnel. We have not received a single apartment in the city 
of Nalchik in recent years, although one out of every three 
members of our staff needs one. 
  [Goplachev] What would you like to say in conclusion? 
  [Abazov] I want to express satisfaction with the adoption of 
the constitutions of the Russian Federation and Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. 
These exceptionally important documents will serve as a sound 
legal foundation for the stabilization of economic and political 
conditions and reinforce the legal system and the administration 
of justice. The individual has been granted broader rights and 
freedoms. 
  The Constitution reaffirmed the organizational principle of 
the procuracy as a single centralized system. Edicts of the 
Russian Federation president assigned the procuracy the 
functions of coordinating the activities of law enforcement 
agencies in the fight against crime and granted our personnel 
various types of social protection. 
  We will evaluate our own performance from the standpoint of 
the requirements engendered by these changes.

Republic] MVD: "MVD: Year's Results"] 
  [Text] The results of the work performed by the internal 
affairs agencies in 1993 attest to the fact that the crime 
situation in republic as a whole is being monitored. 
  During the past year 7681 crimes were recorded in the 
republic. This is 0.6 percent less than during the preceding 
year. 
  There was a drop in the number of crimes committed on the 
streets and in other public places (decrease by 8 percent); and 
in thefts of state property (decrease by 5 percent) and personal 
property (decrease by 10 percent). A larger number of economic 
crimes (increase by 68.7 percent) were revealed, including an 
increase in heinous crimes by a factor of 3.6. 
  Definite positive shifts were achieved in a very important 
work indicator -- the revealing of crimes. As compared with 
1992, that indicator increased by 6 percent, including an 
increase by 6.4 percent in the rate of revealing of crimes of a 
general nature. 
  For purposes of improving the interaction with the internal 
affairs agencies of the Chechen, Ingush, and North Ossetinian 
republics, a coordination conference was held with 
representatives of the internal affairs agencies of those 
republics, where specific joint measures were worked out for 
combatting interregional criminal groups, and for exposing and 
cutting off the channels for the distribution of firearms in the 
North Caucasus. During 1993, a total of 289 cases involving the 
illegal carrying, storage, purchase, manufacture, and sale of 
weapons, ammunition, or explosives were initiated. This is 73.1 
percent more than in 1992, and the rate of exposing thefts of 
means of transportation increased by 5.3 percent. 
  Efforts were undertaken to intensify the fight against 
organized crime. In the course of implementing the tasks posed 
in the Decree of the KBR President, entitled "Measures to 
Intensify the Fight Against Organized Forms of Crime and 
Corruption," and the corresponding orders of the RF [Russian 
Federation] MVD, agencies in the republic revealed and brought 
to criminal responsibility 34 organized criminal groups, from 
which 49 firearms were confiscated, including 36 with rifled 
barrels. A total of 20 thefts on an especially large scale were 
established, and thefts with a total of approximately 1.5 
billion rubles were prevented. 
  Eighteen persons were brought to criminal responsibility as 
a 
result of their corrupt ties, and two representatives of the 
state authority were removed from their jobs for the same reason. 
  There was an increase in the intensity of combatting the 
illegal turnover of narcotics. Eighty-five areas of wild hemp 
were destroyed; 195 persons were brought to criminal 
responsibility; and 213.5 kilograms of narcotic substances were 
confiscated (as compared with 90 kilograms in 1992). 
  The investigators' work had a higher rate of success. 
  There was a 3.5 percent decrease in the crime level in the 
subdivisions of the corrective affairs and social rehabilitation 
service, and jobs were found for the entire special contingent. 
  The situation improved somewhat on the republic's roads. 
There was a reduction (by 13.7 percent) in the committing of 
road-transportation incidents, and a reduction in the number of 
persons killed or injured. 
  At the same time, in a number of areas the republic's 
internal affairs agencies have not only shortcomings, but also 
unresolved problems. There has been an increase by 23 percent in 
the number of heinous crimes of a general criminal nature. They 
became especially widespread in Sovetskiy, Prokhlanenskiy, 
Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, and Baksanskiy rayons, as well as in 
Promyshlennyy Rayon in the city of Nalchik. The exposure rate 
for this type of crimes remains low. 
  For purposes of reacting appropriately to the negative 
processes that have been occurring in the republic's economy, 
there was a quantitative and qualitative reinforcement of the 
subdivisions involved in fighting economic crimes, and an 
improvement in their interaction with other law-enforcement and 
monitoring agencies. In 1993, a total of 543 crimes of an 
economic nature were revealed. This is 64.5 percent more than 
the similar indicator in 1992; 251 heinous crimes were revealed 
-- this is an increase by a factor of 3.6 as compared with the 
previous year. Attempts to commit thefts with the use of 
falsified letters of advice with a total of 2.34 billion rubles 
were thwarted. Six criminal groups of counterfeiters, consisting 
of a total of 26 persons, were detained. Counterfeit money with 
a total value of 16.2 million rubles was confiscated from them. 
Approximately 13 tons of stolen alcohol and 1400 bottles of 
counterfeit vodka were revealed. A considerable number of crimes 
(62 percent of the total of all crimes revealed) continue to be 
committed at economic institutions with the state form of 
ownership. A number of problems linked with this require 
resolution at the governmental level. In particular, it is 
necessary to raise the question of creating under the government 
or the Ministry of Finance an independent auditing apparatus 
that would guarantee the execution of the instructions issued by 
the law-enforcement agencies. This is linked with the 
elimination of the departmental apparatuses, which creates 
serious complications when carrying out documentary audits of 
the economic and financial activity of enterprises where crimes 
are being committed, and without the existence of an official 
document from which, as a rule, criminal cases are not 
initiated. It is also necessary to enact normative documents 
that regulate the procedure for guaranteeing state monitoring of 
the proper use of the credit appropriations from the budget that 
are allocated to enterprises and organizations from the Russian 
budget, and to develop a statute governing the responsibility 
borne by officials for their illegal use. As a result of the 
large increase in the use of counterfeit banknotes and other 
securities and the removal since 1989 of reproduction equipment 
from projects in the resolution system, it would be desirable to 
develop and enact a document governing the procedure for the 
registration and functioning of print shops, companies involved 
in the manufacture of presses and stamps, and private 
individuals and legal entities having copying and reproduction 
equipment, and to take steps of a technical nature to increase 
the degree of protection of monetary denominations, especially 
with a value of from 5000 to 50,000 rubles. 
  There has been a re-examination of the organizational 
principles and tactics for conducting the patrol-post service 
and a search nature has been given to their operation. 
  Militia precinct inspectors revealed 26,326 administrative 
offenses. At the same time they eased up on the positions in 
such an important matter as the fight against drunkenness and 
alcoholism. 
  Improvement in the effectiveness of the operation of the GAI 
[State Motor Vehicles Inspectorate] was aided by the 
introduction of new informational-search systems. At the present 
time they make it possible to resolve completely the task of 
registering means of motor transportation. But it is necessary 
to raise the level of professional training among the GAI 
employees. 
  Despite the preventive steps being taken, in 1993 there was 
an increase in the number of registered fires (increase by 24.8 
percent), the damages from which came to more than 167 million 
rubles. The main cause is the fact that the State Fire 
Inspectorate employees are insufficiently demanding and are lax 
in questions of reinforcing the fire-prevention methods at 
structures that are various forms of property, and also that 
there is weak monitoring of their work by the administrators of 
the fire and emergency rescue service. 
  There was a sharp decrease in the effectiveness of the work 
performed by the Administration of Nondepartmental Protection. 
And this is despite the fact that in 1993 the administration 
personnel rolls were augmented by 178 militiamen. 
  It must be admitted that the overwhelming majority of the 
personnel have been conscientiously executing their official 
duties, frequently displaying, in their fight against crime, 
high moral and professional qualities. In 1993 incentive awards 
were given to almost two-thirds of the personnel; three 
employees were awarded state decorations; Senior Lieutenant of 
Militia A. B. Bitsuyev was posthumously nominated for the Order 
of Personal Bravery. Nevertheless, the number of violations of 
legality that have been committed by employees remains high, as 
is attested to by instances of illegal detention, red tape 
methods, and other violations that were revealed. 
  In 1993 the number of registered illegal acts that were 
committed by citizens against militia employees increased by a 
factor of 6. For 566 of these incidents, the materials were sent 
to the court so that administrative measures could be applied to 
the violators; 16 criminal cases were initiated, 13 of which 
were linked with an attempt on the life of militia workers. 
During the past year three militia employees died as a result of 
these circumstances. 
  An extremely acute problem is the problem of providing the 
personnel with housing and with apartment telephones. A total of 
933 MVD workers are in need of housing; 1520 employees do not 
have home telephones. A way out of the situation can be seen in 
the creation and implementation of a comprehensive long-range 
program that has been approved by the republic government and 
the RF MVD, for the social development of the republic's 
internal affairs agencies in the next two or three years. 
  The results of the operational service activities were 
analyzed in all the city rayon agencies, services, and 
subdivisions of the MVD, and specific measures to improve their 
operation have been planned. There are grounds for assuming that 
the execution of what has been planned will make it possible to 
achieve a considerable improvement in the public and political 
situation in the republic and to intensify the fight against 
crime. One would like to hope that these goals will be 
maintained by the political parties, public movements and 
associations, and the entire population of the republic.

Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry: "How To Solve the 
Crisis? Activity, Problems, and Prospects of the Agroindustrial 
Complex"] 
  [Text] It has always been this way: at the end of each year 
a man takes a critical look at what he has done. He analyzes his 
successes and failures and ponders measures which he thinks will 
guarantee a better future. Last year was a terrible one for 
Georgia. The political, economic, and social crisis caused by 
the civil war and patriotic war, the grave crime situation, the 
break-up of established economic ties, hyperinflation, the 
drastic decline in production, the grave shortage of energy 
resources, the chronic paralysis of transportation, the 
breakdown of discipline, people's general loss of the sense of 
responsibility, lawlessness, and so on--these are just a few of 
the problems that have brought our country and people to the 
brink of catastrophe. 
  I will briefly analyze the causes of the crisis in Georgia's 
agriculture and food industry and propose ideas which, I am 
convinced, will at least partially bring the sector out of its 
crisis. In this article, of course, I will purposefully ignore 
the few successes which we had last year in spite of everything. 
  Georgia's agriculture and food industry play a crucial role 
in the republic's multi-sectorial economy. Suffice it to say 
that the average yearly amount of its output accounted for 45 
percent of the republic's total volume at last year's prices. 
  Our political and economic independence, which are now a 
reality, has mandated an unprecedented qualitative 
transformation of the sector. It is nonsense to claim that 
Georgia does not have the ability to be economically 
independent. First of all, economic sovereignty does not entail 
isolation or the necessity of living on our own resources alone. 
Second, there are about 90 countries in the world which are 
smaller than Georgia and have far fewer natural resources but 
are at the same time more economically developed and have a much 
higher standard of living. Of course, this does not rule out the 
kinds of difficulties that inevitably arise in the initial 
stages of independence. 
  The first thing to keep in mind is that during the Soviet 
1970s, Georgia's economy took shape not on the basis of its own 
interests but those of the whole USSR. As a result, agriculture 
and the food industry were structured such that priority went to 
the development of tea, citrus, tobacco, grapes, fruit, and 
other subtropical and industrial crops and the processing 
thereof. Meanwhile, the people's supplies of meat and meat 
products, milk and dairy products, vegetable oil, and other food 
items were supplied basically by bringing them into Georgia from 
outside. In that regard, the following statistics are of some 
interest: in the Soviet period, 10 percent of the tea produced 
in Georgia, 25 percent of its citrus, and 20 percent of its wine 
industry output went to meet our own needs; the rest went out of 
the republic. Meanwhile, we were importing 98 percent of the 
grain we needed, 95 percent of the sugar, 70 percent of the 
milk, 50 percent of the meat, and 90 percent of the vegetable 
oil. 
  It needs to be said frankly that last year was the worst one 
in our agroindustrial sector's history. Preliminary statistics 
show that crop yields and livestock productivity fell, not one 
kind of product output forecast [prognozi] was fulfilled, and 
processing and delivery contract obligations were not met. We 
couldn't even make a minimum contribution to the state's food 
resources, although it should be pointed out that goods produced 
in the private sector which, as a result of privatization, has 
been given large amounts of agricultural lands that used to 
belong to collective farms, have not been reported. 
  Here are a number of figures characterizing the main 
sectors. 
  Forecasts called for the procurement of 300,000 tonnes of 
green tea leaf. In actuality, 132,000 tonnes were picked--only 
44 percent of the target. The forecast was fulfilled by only 30 
percent in Mingrelia and 13 percent in Abkhazia. Things were 
made worse by the fact that private tea-processing plants have 
proliferated the last while--so-called family factories, so that 
a great deal of tea leaf disappears, and there is as yet no 
normative act to regulate things. 
  Besides the fact that factories like these grossly violate 
technological parameters and sanitation norms, sales of the 
finished product go on without any accounting and reporting, 
totally ignoring the state's interests. 
  Things are also bad in regard to citrus procurement--the 
snow 
that fell in late November, and early frosts, hurt us badly. 
  It's hard to imagine, but we won't be able to procure more 
than 4,000 or 5,000 tonnes of fruit this year. It has got so bad 
that in Gori Rayon, which used to procure an average of 100,000 
tonnes, only about 600 tonnes have been bought by the state 
sector to date, and in Kaspi and Khashuri rayons no fruit has 
been procured at all. 
  Things are no better in the grape industry. Only 72,600 
tonnes of grapes have been procured--only 20 percent of the 
planned 365,000 tonnes. Kakhetia, famed for its vineyards and 
wine making, has only procured 64,000 tonnes; western Georgia 
has only procured 6,000 tonnes. 
  Of course, we have to take note of the damage caused by 
several hail storms; nevertheless, the situation is practically 
unprecedented in the past 10 years. 
  A total of 380,000 tonnes of grain have been procured on all 
categories of farms--57 percent of the forecast. Cereals account 
for 45 percent of all grain procurements. 
  A total of 25,700 tonnes of vegetables (12 percent of the 
forecast) have been procured and sold in the social sector; the 
figure is 3,000 (10 percent) for early potatoes and 17,000 (20 
percent) for late potatoes. The situation is also very bad in 
livestock farming, especially in the social sector. 
  All types of livestock and poultry populations have 
virtually 
disappeared on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. As of 1 December the 
social-sector farms had produced 14,300 tonnes of meat and 
38,900 tonnes of milk; average annual milk yields per cow stood 
at 555 kilograms. 
  One bright spot in the overall decline of livestock farming 
can be seen in the Prinvelmretsvi [Russian Ptitseprom] system, 
which has also suffered, but the sector does show signs of 
revival. 
  There are now 2.2 million birds in the industrial poultry 
system--about 350,000 more than at the beginning of the year. 
  Agriculture's lag has drastically reduced industrial output, 
where forecasts are also failing to be met. 
  A total of 300 million standard containers of fruit and 
vegetable preserves were supposed to be produced; actually, only 
29.3 million containers were--46.7 percent of the figure for the 
same period last year. Instead of 20 million standard containers 
of baby food, only 2 million containers were produced. 
  A total of 3.25 billion cigarettes were produced--only 46.4 
percent of the year's target. 
  Our once-proud mineral water production has also declined: 
26.7 million bottles were produced in 11 months--27 percent of 
the forecast. 
  The year's forecast was not even half fulfilled by 
enterprises manufacturing wine, brandy, and champagne bottles, 
glass jars, and certain other kinds. 
  We also failed to meet inter-governmental contract 
obligations on deliveries of industrial goods. Still, people 
ought to know that goods worth the following amounts were 
shipped in accordance with inter-governmental contracts (prices 
are in accordance with trade clearing rates stipulated by our 
inter-governmental contract with Turkmenistan): 35.8 million 
dollars to Turkmenistan, 24.4 million to Kazakhstan, 0.6 million 
to Azerbaijan, 1.6 million to Ukraine, 0.5 million to 
Kyrgyzstan, and 0.3 million to Armenia; in exchange, we got 
natural gas, wheat and other foodstuffs. 
  These figures clearly demonstrate the grave situation in the 
agroindustrial complex, and no commentary is needed. It is 
better to explore the causes of this deep crisis and speak 
frankly about measures to solve them--measures which, the 
ministry thinks, should serve to stop the deepening crisis and 
then stabilize and revive the sector. 
  Readers will agree that hasty privatization has brought it 
about that the process of changing forms of property ownership 
has run ahead of the shaping of the right kind of entrepreneur. 
  As entrepreneurs, kolkhozes and sovkhozes have now lost 
their 
own organizational and management character, but a new type of 
farm has yet to take shape. 
  People in the country, unfortunately, have taken free 
enterprise and democracy to mean that anything goes, and this 
has fostered the mass theft of socially-owned property. A huge 
percentage of the vehicles, tractors, farm implements, tools and 
pieces of equipment, livestock, funds, products, and other 
assets have disappeared. In many places, it is the officials of 
kolkhozes and state farms who are the ringleaders in the 
thievery--even acting in broad daylight, in front of local 
authorities and often with their support. The situation is such 
that we no longer have an organized entrepreneur in the 
countryside, we no longer have organized production. 
  So far, privatization of the land has not produced the 
desired results; it has also been accompanied by violence, 
high-handedness, and violation of the law. Even worse, far from 
being used effectively, privatized lands are often left idle. 
Especially heartbreaking is the fact that perennial plantings 
(grapevines, fruit trees) are being uprooted. Land privatization 
has been slowed and people have been set against one another by 
the fact that, from the start, the whole system of management of 
the agroindustrial complex was left out of the process, 
including local authorities and farm officials. Often, this is 
why big plantations of perennial plantings have been broken up, 
and, as a rule, crop yields have declined greatly. 
  Agricultural reform requires a balance of land 
privatization, 
the adoption of various forms of management, the shaping of free 
entrepreneurs, and the establishment of relations with them that 
are characteristic of a market economy. 
  We believe that reforms ought to be carried out in a 
comprehensive manner. One-sidedness is the reason why the 
household-farm sector has been given large amounts of 
agricultural lands which should not have been privatized. It is 
especially annoying that this big mistake was recently made 
legal again by the Cabinet of Ministers, which ignored the 
agricultural organs' role in the matter. The sector's lengthy 
paralysis is also largely due to the war and the grave crime 
situation. In this regard, there have been more than 3,000 cases 
of assault in the agroindustrial complex, resulting in damages 
costing tens of billions of coupons. Yet the republic's law 
enforcement organs don't have time for the woes of the 
countryside. The criminal world senses the fact that the peasant 
is left unprotected and has been robbing him freely in the 
fields, in his home, on the road and in the market. The same 
processes are having a negative impact on efforts to establish 
relations with foreign firms and investors. Foreign businessmen 
are obviously interested in Georgia but they hesitate to 
establish relations because of the risk. 
  We are also being hurt by the fact that we have not yet 
mastered the style and methods of operating in the new 
conditions, either in management or production. In the 
countryside, people think that free enterprise means you are not 
obligated to anybody for anything and nobody can make you 
responsible. Entrepreneurs, local authorities, our own ministry, 
and others are doing the wrong thing by trying to manage the 
sector by the old dictatorial methods. We have yet to create the 
necessary mechanisms for the state's relations with 
agro-entrepreneurs--mechanisms such as tax and financial-credit 
service systems, a free market for material-technical supplies, 
protectionism toward the sector's development, and other things 
which would foster the population's interest in developing 
agriculture. 
  The sector has been badly damaged by the break-up of 
traditional ties and structures, so that agriculture has been 
left without essential items such as toxic chemicals, veterinary 
medicines, mineral fertilizers, fuel, lubricants, equipment, and 
other materials which agricultural production cannot do without. 
  People also need to know that agriculture last year received 
only 3.9 percent of the amount of gasoline allocated in 1990, 
16.8 percent of the diesel fuel, and 0.3 percent of the 
tractors. As for cars and trucks, agricultural machinery and 
implements, and chemicals and veterinary medicines, it has been 
three years since any came into the republic. 
  In order to bring the agroindustrial complex--especially 
agriculture, its main sector--out of the crisis, we have to 
start by eliminating the causes. First, and as quickly as 
possible, we need to lay down the legal foundations for reform 
and make it specific and efficient. We must not forget that 
there are as many different characteristics as there are 
villages, enterprises, and labor collectives. They all have to 
be dealt with, of course, in a legislative framework while 
taking account of particular and specific conditions. 
  Despite all our troubles, I am convinced that what our 
agriculture needs is not revolutionary reforms but systematic 
and well-thought-out evolutionary reforms. They will require the 
support of our legislative and executive branches and help from 
our law enforcement, financial, banking, and other organs. They 
will require stability and measures to revive the sector. 
  As for the future which we must create for Georgia's 
agriculture, I see it this way: 
  Forms of entrepreneurship characteristic of market relations 
will be broadly developed in the countryside, including 
agricultural cooperatives, household and peasant farms, state 
farms, joint-stock companies, firms, production combines, 
associations, and other types of business structures. 
  Unlike Soviet-type kolkhozes and sovkhozes, on which 
everything belonged to everybody but in fact nothing belonged to 
anybody, the new type of entrepreneurs will be full-fledged 
masters of the land that has been turned over to them, the goods 
they produce, and all their property; they will manage things 
and sell their goods as they see fit; 
  --direct horizontal links will develop between entrepreneurs 
and consumers, entrepreneurs and service organizations--without 
interference or dictation from outside; 
  --in the transition period, great importance must be 
accorded 
contract relations designed to regulate the efficient exchange 
of goods and services between the republic and individual 
regions. 
  Because of Georgia's natural conditions, our agriculture 
will 
remain multi-sectorial. Market relations will deploy production 
sectors in such a manner as to gain the most payback from every 
hectare of agricultural land. 
  Traditional forms of management will be replaced by 
economic-management partnership, which will totally eliminate 
coercion and interference in entrepreneurs' internal business 
affairs. 
  The state's relations with enterprises of the agroindustrial 
complex will be conducted on the basis of a tax system which 
should foster the formation of independent and free 
entrepreneurs. 
  In conclusion, let me say this: 
  Last year we failed to alleviate the crisis and achieve the 
things called for in the Cabinet of Ministers' 5 March 1993 
Decree "On Solving the Crisis of the Georgian Republic's 
Agroindustrial Complex in 1993-1995." We failed because we were 
unable even to stop the causes of the crisis, let alone 
eliminate them. 
  I am convinced, nevertheless, that 1994 will be a turnaround 
year, that our free fall will end and real rebuilding will 
begin. It is certain that the past year has made not only the 
republic's leaders but also the people see many things and draw 
the necessary conclusions. 
  As far as the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry is 
concerned, it fully understands its own role and responsibility 
in these processes and will make every effort to bring the 
sector out of its crisis.

<F P=106> [Article by Temur Mirianashvili: "A Good Stone Doesn't Quit </F>
the Wall. Thoughts on Today's Emigration"] 
  [Text] These days we keep repeating Niko 
Lortkipanidze's words, "Georgia is being sold off!" 
  Indeed, Georgia's copper and timber, works of art and 
historical relics, are being sold off--in short, anything that 
can be sold and hauled off. 
  The worst harm, however, is being done by what is 
universally called the "brain drain" and universally considered 
national self-genocide. 
  Obviously, we haven't realized the danger posed by the 
brain drain--despite the fact that our best artists, scientists, 
specialists, businessmen, and athletes are leaving Georgia. Our 
fittest and smartest youth are leaving Georgia. 
  Yet we seem almost proud that our elite are emigrating. Our 
terrible sickness--snobbism--is to blame for this strange pride; 
we rejoice in any contact with the West, even if it is 
destructive. 
  The brain drain is bad enough for the nation, but most of 
the 
"drainees" themselves are not very well off. Only a handful have 
decent lives in the West (to say nothing of a happy life, let 
alone one of luxury). There are more than 25 million unemployed 
persons in the countries of the European Union. They can't find 
jobs for their own qualified cadres, so are they supposed to 
clasp graduates of Soviet colleges (or nongraduates) to their 
bosom? 
  Hence, our emigres have to take the kinds of jobs which the 
natives there won't touch. Some can't even get those jobs and 
have to support themselves by crime and prostitution. Some even 
take the easier route--begging. True, the Western beggar is 
materially better off than a scientist here, but material 
wellbeing alone doesn't make a life! It's sad to have to argue 
these things now in Georgia. 
  So that you won't think that I am against all emigration, 
I'll try to make myself more clear. 
  There are two kinds of emigration, political and economic. 
The political emigre is someone who goes abroad because he is 
being persecuted at home on political grounds, his life and 
liberty are threatened, or he is banned from work in his 
profession. 
  You cannot accuse political emigres of unconcern for their 
country's fate or of shirking their patriotic duty; economic 
emigres, however, do deserve that accusation. 
  The economic emigre is also one who claims that he is going 
abroad in order to have better working conditions, to work more 
fruitfully and eventually benefit his homeland. Our elite should 
not use such things as the economic crisis, the paralysis of 
industry, and material want as excuses to seek the good life 
abroad; rather, they should do everything they can to revive the 
economy, revitalize science, and restore industry here. 
  Otherwise, Georgia will perish. 
  All countries have suffered crises, but the only ones which 
have survived are those whose most gifted and knowledgeable 
citizens have fought and done everything they could to save 
their homeland. No country can get ahead any other way. 
  Many of our fellow countrymen became political emigres both 
under the communists and under the "Rounds" [the Gamsakhurdia 
regime]. Most of them were dedicated to their country, and for 
them it was a tragedy to have to go abroad. Official propaganda 
reviled them, and naturally our people tended to sympathize with 
the emigres. 
  Today, political emigration from Georgia is unnecessary, 
because no one is persecuted on political grounds and no one is 
banned from professional activity. Hence, attitudes toward 
would-be emigres ought to change. 
  In my opinion, Georgian emigration today is of three 
categories. 
  The first category comprises the majority of those 
who have left their homeland. These people are more or less 
essential to Georgia. In the West, however, which has tens of 
millions of unemployed specialists of its own, nobody needs 
Georgian seekers of the good life. Hence, their efforts abroad 
neither bring glory to their homeland nor do them much good 
materially. In fact, many of them--though I wouldn't say this of 
every emigre in this category--bring shame and disgrace to 
Georgia with their begging, crime, prostitution, and other 
unworthy actions. 
  The second category comprises a small minority of 
Georgian emigres. These are people who have a certain amount of 
authority (sometimes high prestige) in the West and are, of 
course, materially well off. 
  There are those who justify these people's living 
abroad--after all, many have brought fame to Georgia and have 
even helped us with hard currency. 
  I personally, however, think that they are much more 
essential in Georgia. Quite aside from the precious value of the 
activities of scientists and specialists, when people are in 
trouble their efforts are magnified a hundredfold by working 
side by side with eminent countrymen. Gifted artists can greatly 
alleviate their countrymen's heavy burden. 
  All else aside, the moral example which the popular 
celebrity 
sets for ordinary people who have remained in their cold and 
hungry homeland is priceless. 
  As for bringing renown to Georgia in the world and 
generating 
hard currency, that can be done without pulling up roots--for 
example, by touring [gastroli]. 
  The third category comprises students, who are 
temporary emigres, so to speak. After completing their studies 
they ought to come back to Georgia--they ought to, 
but I'm certain that many of them do not intend to do so and 
won't, if they can get citizenship abroad. 
  I know many will disagree with me, but I think it is wrong 
to 
go abroad to school--especially on such a mass scale. 
  Someone will, no doubt, remind me of Ilia [Chavchavadze], 
Akaki [Tsereteli], Vazha [Pshavela], and the other Tergdaleulebi 
["Drinkers of the Terek"--19th-century Georgians who went to 
Russia to college and returned to lead Georgia]. Yes, yes, I 
know. But in the time of the Tergdaleulebi it was impossible to 
get a higher education in Georgia; we didn't have universities 
and professors. Our library holdings were extremely small. The 
situation is entirely different today: a diligent youngster can 
get a high-quality education even without leaving Georgia. 
  Second, surely no one imagines that anyone among that 
brilliant constellation of Tergdaleulebi would choose to stay in 
a foreign country, even a foreign country's library, at a time 
when Georgia was in a grave crisis, at war, and the nation was 
fighting for its very life. 
  Also, consider this: there are rumors from the West that 
most 
of our young people there are not studying very hard. These 
reports are coming by the grapevine and also from students who 
have been there. Just read and listen to what Dato Turashvili 
and others have to say. They practically never mention the 
interiors of libraries and university lecture halls. Instead, 
Georgia's "future pride" talks lavishly about drinking, drugs, 
and "getting laid." 
  Some readers may think I'm overly exaggerating and 
categorical, but I must repeat what I firmly believe: Georgia 
can only be saved if its sons and daughters, especially the 
gifted and talented ones, do their civic duty. Georgians 
shouldn't seek haven in other countries just because life in 
Georgia is hard; they should try to make life better here. It 
has never been easy to build a country. 
  We also need to learn that life is more than merely enough 
food, warmth, and entertainment. Life is much deeper and more 
wonderful. It is a misfortune, of course, to live in a 
devastated country. But it is happiness to rebuild a devastated 
country. It is happiness just to try. 
  Remember the Georgian proverb, A Good Stone Doesn't Quit the 
Wall. I quote it not because I think our emigres are "bad 
stones"--not at all. I don't consider them to be "quitters" from 
Georgia's "wall." It's just that most of them have not thought 
their position through. Probably only a very few of our emigres 
are like bad stones, or like rats who are the first to leave a 
ship in trouble (and, incidentally, the first to die). 
  Georgia will certainly survive and win. There will certainly 
be a real Georgian celebration in Georgia. And then all our 
countrymen will yearn to come home. But those who stood by 
Georgia to the end in times of trouble and those who stayed safe 
and warm in a foreign country will never eat and drink at the 
same party. 
  Not because anybody will be locked out of that Georgian 
celebration, but because some will be contented men (in the 
civilized West they attained the standard of living where most 
citizens are content with their lot), while the others will be 
happy men (there is no greater happiness than to take part in 
your homeland's victory). The contented man and the happy man 
have nothing in common, because contentment and happiness are 
mutually exclusive. 
  P.S. A few words about people who are getting rich off 
the brain drain. Someone named Giorgi Bagaturia wrote in 
IVERIA-EKSPRESI last summer that he had created a company which 
helps highly trained Georgian specialists become Australian 
citizens. Bagaturia emphasizes that only top specialists need 
apply. So this man is getting rich by selling his own people, 
his own kind. 
  Unfortunately, the Bagaturias have proliferated among 
us. Some newspapers, for example, publish photos of foreign men 
seeking friendly ladies--but the friendly Georgian ladies, for 
some reason, have to be young and good looking (is friendship 
possible only with a woman, one who is beautiful and young?). 
You can tell from their photos, moreover, that many of these 
friendly men are sex maniacs. 
  What we are seeing in Georgia, then, is the emergence 
of the heirs of those who marketed their own flesh and blood in 
the bazaars of Istanbul and Cairo in past centuries.

Georgia: "Who We Are and What We Want. Meet the Social 
Democrats"] 
  [Text] 
  What is Social Democracy? 
  Social Democracy originated on the basis of a merger of the 
ideas of liberalism and the reformist current of the workers' 
socialist movement. Its ideological roots are Christian ethics, 
enlightenment, humanist philosophy, and the experience of the 
people's and national liberation movement and the struggle for 
women's emancipation. The basic values of Social Democracy are 
freedom, justice, and solidarity. 
  Social Democracy was not immune to mistakes in the past. In 
fact, considerable harm was done to it by failure to appreciate 
the nationality factor and by enthusiasm for Marx's utopia, but 
in time Social Democracy has overcome these mistakes and taken 
firm positions of pragmatism. 
  What is the content of Social Democracy's basic values 
(freedom, justice, solidarity)? 
  The Social Democrats' credo is that every human being is 
born 
free, every human being has the right to be free of political 
dictatorship and violence. Freedom also means freedom for the 
dissident. No one should be oppressed by fear or material want. 
The other person's freedom defines the boundaries that 
constitute the condition for every individual person's freedom. 
  Social Democrats believe that justice means equal rights and 
opportunities and the elimination of any national or social 
oppression of human beings. It means social protection for the 
individual, and equality of men and women. A condition of 
justice is every person's independence from proprietors and 
politicians. 
  Freedom and justice are impossible without solidarity. It is 
the practical reflection of compassion manifested toward the 
victims of injustice. Every human being needs the support of 
other human beings. Every human being who is destitute or in 
trouble must be able to count on society's solidarity. Neither 
submissive collectivism nor selfish individualism can create the 
prerequisites for the individual's self-determination. It is 
possible only through the joint actions of free human beings. 
  What is your attitude toward democracy and 
politics? 
  Democracy is incompatible with totalitarianism and anarchy. 
It means self-government by the people. But it does not mean mob 
rule. Democracy is a reflection of the will of the people based 
on inviolability of the law. It is genuine only when government 
can be changed by peaceful means. Democracy must guarantee the 
rights of the minority. By its nature it can only be pluralistic. 
  The Social Democrats do not believe that politics is the art 
of immorality (although politics and morality are not synonyms). 
What the Social Democrats strive for is to bring more moral 
motives into politics, to make it more humane and just. This 
means, in particular, that the people must be told the truth, 
however bitter it may be. 
  Are the Social Democrats materialists or idealists? 
  The Social Democrats take the position of a pluralism of 
world views. Hence, they include materialists and idealists. 
  Do you believe in God? 
  People of various creeds have rallied around the Social 
Democrats, people whose attitudes toward religion vary. Our 
ranks include believers and atheists. 
  In our view, the state cannot be either atheistic or 
theistic. At the same time, we do deem it possible to have the 
best cadres of religious circles take active part in state and 
social affairs. The leadership of Georgia's Social Democratic 
Party [SDP], for example, includes clergymen. 
  What does your symbol, the rose, mean? 
  The rose is the acknowledged symbol of all Social Democrats. 
It is the symbol of harmony, nobility, beauty, and compassion. 
  What is your attitude toward socialism? 
  While communists view socialism as a social formation, the 
Social Democrats use the word to mean constant, moral movement 
toward an increasingly humane, just, and democratic society. 
  We are not trying to impose some new way of life on people. 
All we are trying to create is the political, legal, and 
economic conditions necessary for people themselves to change 
their way of life. This should take place through reform rather 
than by revolution. 
  How else do you differ from the communists? 
  Communists deny political and world-view pluralism, the 
multi-party system, the market economy, and belief in God. They 
view justice as a state in which everyone is equalized. What we 
believe is that justice is reflected in equality of opportunity. 
The communists fight against wealth; the Social Democrats fight 
against poverty. 
  How do the Social Democrats differ from the right-wing 
parties? 
  The Social Democrats represent a left-of-center people's 
party. We differ from the right-wing parties (liberals, 
conservatives, Christian democrats) in that we try to use state 
regulation of chaotic market conditions to redistribute material 
goods to all members of society, so that every person's freedom 
is materially guaranteed. The Social Democrats strive to broaden 
democracy not only in the political but also the economic and 
social spheres of life. 
  Whom do you categorize as "working people"? 
  Both hired workers and proprietors. Both strata do labor 
that 
is useful to society. Therefore, the Social Democrats try to 
harmonize their interests through social partnership. This is 
accomplished through trilateral contracts of mutual obligations 
between hired workers (the trade unions), proprietors 
(entrepreneurs' associations) and the state (government). 
  What is your attitude toward capitalism? 
  Capitalism in the classical sense does not exist in any 
country today. As a result of structural reforms brought about 
through the efforts of the workers' movement, the trade unions' 
active struggle, and the social democratic parties, corporate 
capitalism has taken shape in the Western countries, which is 
based on group and joint-stock ownership of the means of 
production. This has radically improved the material wellbeing 
of the working man and made his life better, although many 
social problems remain unsolved. 
  What is your attitude toward private property? 
  We favor a variety of forms of property ownership--private, 
state, group, and mixed ownership. However, we do prefer group, 
joint-stock ownership, which makes it possible to realize our 
motto "Every Working Man Should Become a Proprietor, Every 
Proprietor Should Become a Working Man." Experience has shown 
that no one form of property ownership by itself guarantees 
freedom and justice. The important thing is who has the right to 
manage the property. Our main concern, therefore, is to see to 
it that the immediate producer of things is involved in 
exercising that right. 
  What is your attitude toward social insurance? 
  In our opinion, social insurance needs to be personified. 
The 
total amount of insurance contributions accumulated during every 
person's working career should be returned to him in the form of 
a pension. The same thing is true of health care. In the case of 
a worker's untimely death, the remaining insurance ought to be 
turned over to his family. People who do not work (for various 
reasons) should be provided aid and medical assistance by the 
state. 
  How do you see the transition from the post-communist 
society to the market economy? 
  The world has no experience of a transition from a 
post-communist society to a market economy. We cannot accomplish 
the task if we go by the methodology of the transition from 
feudalism to capitalism. There's still no way to make an egg out 
of an omelet. Making the transition from a post-communist 
society to a market economy by way of revolutionary-extremist, 
so-called "shock therapy" has shattered economies and 
impoverished the people. Georgia provides a clear example of 
this. 
  The Social Democrats offer society a conception for 
establishing a socially just and ecologically safe market 
economy. It calls for a phased transition to market relations. 
At the same time, state regulation of the process is vitally 
important. It is the state that must create market institutions 
and legislative foundations, carry out financial-credit reform, 
implement a selective protectionist policy, train a corps of 
managers, harmonize private and social interests, and provide 
for the people's social and ecological protection. 
  How do you view privatization? 
  The Social Democrats make a distinction between the 
privatization of management and property. They believe, at the 
same time, that privatization of state property ought to be 
preceded by the privatization of state management of the economy. 
  Factories and plants now owned by the state ought to be 
transferred to the relevant collectives, to group, joint-stock 
ownership. As for the private production sector, it should 
basically be formed by having individuals pool their money to 
create new private enterprises. 
  Retail and consumer service establishments should be sold to 
individual persons or groups of persons. 
  Individual farm operations should be established in the 
countryside. Kolkhozes should be converted into individual 
farmers' cooperatives; state farms should be turned into 
joint-stock operations. 
  The state sector of the economy, which, as in the Western 
countries, is not subject to privatization, should be converted 
to a commercial footing. 
  What ought to be done about mass unemployment? 
  First, new jobs need to be created. Public works need to be 
organized, professional retraining centers need to be 
established, and work time needs to be reduced through the 
adoption of modern technologies. 
  We Social Democrats believe we ought to adopt a free year: 
once every five years every worker should have the right to take 
up to one year off to take care of personal business while 
retaining minimum salary, his job, and his time in service. 
  What is your attitude toward trade unions? 
  Unfortunately, we do not have genuine free trade unions in 
Georgia. Members of existing trade unions include both 
proprietors and hired workers, which makes the trade unions an 
adjunct to state administration and powerless to fight. Trade 
unions ought to include only hired workers as members; factory 
and plant executives ought to join entrepreneurs' associations. 
It is time for Parliament to pass a law on trade unions which 
will ensure their independence from management. 
  In your opinion, how can we solve the problem of 
interethnic relations? 
  The Georgian SDP denounces chauvinism, national nihilism, 
national arrogance, and isolationism, and calls on all ethnic 
groups to work together for mutual benefit. The party's ranks 
include representatives of various nationalities who live in 
Georgia and respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  It is a matter of the Georgian people's honor to foster the 
free development of national minorities living in Georgia. 
  One of our special concerns is the protection of the 
interests of the Abkhazian people and Georgians living in 
Abkhazia, and ensuring the full autonomy of Abkhazia within 
Georgia. Systematic democracy alone can achieve interethnic 
harmony. 
  Georgian Social Democrats believe that national minorities 
living in Georgia whose ethnic territory lies outside of Georgia 
ought to be given cultural-national autonomy. This means giving 
them the opportunity to create national societies which operate 
on self-governing principles and engage in creating their own 
schools, cultural centers, publishing houses, and so on. 
  What importance do you attribute to the factor of 
Russia in regard to consolidating Georgia's independence? 
  The Georgian SDP has repeatedly stated in public that our 
homeland is of strategic concern to Russia; we must take account 
of this concern and satisfy it, of course, in consideration of 
modern realities. At the same time, Russia must also take 
account of and satisfy the Georgian nation's national interests. 
Only in this way can we create a civilized system of 
Georgian-Russian relations. 
  Trying to talk tough to the Russians and threaten them with 
the UN and NATO is just Quixotic and, naturally, does not bring 
good results. Abkhazia and Samachablo [South Ossetia] are clear 
proof of that. Anyone who tries to make confrontation points 
against Russia is undermining Georgia's independence. 
  What is your assessment of Georgia's joining the 
CIS? 
  The only sad thing is that the decision to do so came so 
late. Isolationism did much harm to Georgia's national 
interests. Our economy was destroyed and ruined, our people were 
impoverished and made destitute, cultural development halted, 
senseless conflicts sacrificed the lives of thousands of young 
people, and the tragedy of Abkhazia turned countless numbers of 
people into refugees. We could have avoided all of this with a 
more conciliatory policy toward Russia. 
  In the form that the CIS has now it does not properly 
reflect 
the level of actual integration of the states that used to be 
part of the Soviet Union. In this regard, Georgia can have its 
own say regarding the gradual transformation of the CIS into a 
Eurasian Home which will have common work-coordination bodies 
and a multi-national secretariat headed by a General Secretary. 
  Some political parties are in favor of a federal system 
for Georgia. How about you? 
  We are categorically against it. Dividing Georgia up into 
Kartli, Guria, Mingrelia, Kakhetia, and other provinces, with 
their own governments, will foment parochialism and split the 
country. Therefore, Georgia must remain a unitary state; at the 
same time, the autonomies should be granted broad rights of 
self-government. 
  Is your party a member of the Socialist 
International? 
  Georgia's SDP is a part of international Social Democracy. 
In 
more than 20 countries today (Austria, Norway, Spain, Holland, 
Greece, Australia, and others) the government is headed by 
Social Democrats. Outstanding leaders of international Social 
Democracy include F. Mitterand (the President of France), F. 
Gonzales (the Prime Minister of Spain), F. Vranitzky (the 
Chancellor of Austria), and others. 
  International Social Democracy is a powerful anti-communist 
movement, and for this reason it has been the target of constant 
pro-communist attacks both here and abroad. 
  International Social Democracy is coordinated by the 
Socialist International, which was revived in 1951. Its members 
include ruling and opposition socialist, social-democratic, and 
labor parties in over 100 countries, parties adhering to the 
same principles. From 1976 to 1992, the Socialist International 
was headed by former German Chancellor Willy Brandt; its 
chairman now is former French Prime Minister Pierre Maurois. 
  Last year, Georgia's SDP became a member of the Socialist 
International with the status of permanent guest. 
  When was Georgia's SDP created? 
  Our party was created in November 1918. It was founded by 
Noe 
Zhordania, Noe Ramishvili, Silibistro Dzhibladze, and others. 
Both then and now, the party's basic program calls for freedom 
of the nation and the individual and material wellbeing as the 
cornerstone of human life. 
  Are you the heirs of the mensheviks? 
  The mensheviks represented the reform wing of Russia's 
Social 
Democratic Workers' Party. They opposed bolshevism, that is, 
Leninism. Under Noe Zhordania's leadership, Georgian Social 
Democrats also opposed Russia's mensheviks. It would be wrong, 
therefore, to call Georgian Social Democrats mensheviks, because 
at the time they were the majority in Georgia while the 
bolsheviks were in the minority. 
  Then and now, Georgian Social Democrats have taken the 
position of Europe's Social Democrats. 
  Who killed Ilia Chavchavadze? 
  The man who actually killed the Great Ilia was Gigola 
Berbichashvili, a representative of the bolshevik wing of 
Russia's Social Democratic Workers' Party who was later a state 
official in Communist Georgia. Blaming this shocking 
assassination on Georgia's SDP is just a treacherous trick of 
the communists. Ilia Chavchavadze was murdered in 1907; our 
party, on the other hand, was formed 11 years afterward, in 
1918. Despite the ideological differences between Ilia 
Chavchavadze and Noe Zhordania, both became victims of 
bolshevism. As Mikhako Tsereteli wrote, "Being sacrificed for 
the nation and oppressed by the same enemy raised both these 
personages to the heights." 
  The SDP led independent Georgia from 1918 to 1921. What 
accomplishments did it achieve? 
  That was Georgia's little Golden Age. The Georgian Social 
Democrats created history's first Social Democratic republic and 
laid the foundation for the kind of model of social development 
that has now come to be known as the Swedish model. 
  Georgia's Social Democrats established a social market 
economy, political pluralism, municipal self-government, the 
institution of trial by jury, a democratic constitution, and 
national armed forces; they restored the autocephaly of the 
Church, opened the first Georgian university, and so on. It is 
no wonder, therefore, that Noe Zhordania's government was 
accorded high praise by England's Prime Minister Ramsey 
MacDonald, who wrote: "I have studied its constitution and its 
social and economic reconstruction, and what I saw there is the 
kind of life I would like to see in our country." 
  The Georgian experience at that time served to enrich 
international Social Democracy. 
  What was the cause of the downfall of the Georgian 
Social Democratic republic in 1921? 
  After Azerbaijan and Armenia were seized by Bolshevik 
Russia, 
the 200,000-man Red Army invaded Georgia and took it over. For a 
month and a half, Georgia's Social Democratic government and the 
Georgian army put up staunch resistance against the aggressor. 
The war cost the lives of 30,000 Georgians, and the Georgian 
government, under Noe Zhordania's leadership, was forced to 
emigrate abroad, where they worked actively to expose the act of 
aggression. The whole world learned the truth that communist 
rule was established in Georgia not by a people's uprising but 
as a result of Bolshevik Russia's intervention. 
  What happened to your party after Georgia was taken 
over? 
  Georgia's SDP went underground. Despite communist 
repressions 
which cost the lives of about 80,000 party members, the Georgian 
Social Democrats never stopped fighting to restore Georgia's 
independence. The SDP led the uprising in 1924. The party held 
its Third (illegal) Congress in 1925 and its Fourth (illegal) 
Congress in 1930. The party had an illegal, functioning Central 
Committee in Georgia until the start of the 1950s. After its 
members were arrested and shot, the Central Committee's 
functions went over to the party's foreign bureau that had been 
operating in France since 1923. 
  How did the Georgian SDP come to be restored, and 
when? 
  An initiative group was formed in the 1980s, in Tbilisi, to 
restore the party. In February 1990, on the instructions and 
with the encouragement of the party's foreign bureau, the 
Georgian SDP's Fifth Congress was held in Tbilisi; the Congress 
adopted the party's new program and charters and restored its 
leadership bodies. Many people probably don't know that the 
rebirth of the Social Democratic movement in Georgia had Merab 
Kostava as one of its leaders. 
  Does the party have its own press organs? 
  The Georgia SDP publishes a journal called CHVENI DROSHA 
[Our 
Banner] abroad, specifically in Paris; in Georgia it publishes 
the newspaper ERTOBA [Unity] and a journal, SOTSIAL-DEMOKRATI. 
  What was your party's attitude toward the "Rounds?" 
  At first, the Roundtable put together a seemingly reasonable 
program which called for achieving Georgian state independence 
by stages. Later on, unfortunately, it renounced the program; as 
the saying goes, temptation got the better of it and it resorted 
to revolutionary-extremist methods, resulting in confrontation 
with Russia, a standoff with the intelligentsia, the 
resurrection of authoritarianism, splitting of the nation, and 
finally the political collapse of the "Rounds" and the 
ex-President. To be totally truthful, however, overthrowing the 
"Rounds" by force of arms was an unconstitutional act, and, as 
in the case of all other armed coups, this one also resulted in 
Georgia's grave predicament that persists to this day. 
  What is your attitude toward the present 
government? 
  Despite our deep respect for Eduard Shevardnadze, we have to 
say that he lacked sufficient principle to resist the pressure 
of extremist and nationalist forces, which has resulted in an 
unrealistic policy toward Russia and fetishization of the 
Western aid factor. This has cost us all dearly, and now we are 
reaping the fruits of those mistakes. 
  Does your party have an armed force? 
  Our principles and ideas are our weapons. We have no other 
arms. Any political organization that has them ought to be 
banned by law. 
  Who is the chairman of your party? 
  Guram Muchaidze is the Chairman of the SDP of Georgia. He 
was 
born in October 1948, in a worker's family. He graduated with 
honors from Tbilisi Secondary School No 3 and from the History 
Faculty of Tbilisi State University. He was awarded the 
candidate of science degree for his diploma work. At the age of 
30 he defended his doctoral dissertation and was given the rank 
of professor. He worked as head of the Political Science 
Department. He has written over 100 scholarly works. He is 
married and has two children. 
  How many deputies do you have in Parliament? 
  Only two, unfortunately. 
  What is the structure of the party's leadership 
bodies? 
  The party's highest leadership body is the Congress; between 
congresses it is the Central Committee, which convenes once 
every six months. Between meetings of the Central Committee the 
party's affairs are handled by its Political Council. The 
party's foreign bureau is accountable to its Political Council. 
  What regions are your party's local organizations 
operating in? 
  Almost all major regions. The party organization's 
activities 
are presently paralyzed in Abkhazia and Samachablo. 
  Do you have permanent staffers? 
  We do. The apparatus of the Political Council numbers twelve 
staffers. 
  How many members does your party have? 
  The Georgian SDP's members number over 5,000. 
  How is your party funded? 
  Our financial sources are: membership dues and registration 
fees, contributions from its foreign bureau and from members and 
sympathizers, and income from publishing activities. 
  Do you have an account where contributions can be 
made? 
  Here are the particulars: Georgian SDP, MPO 520096, Account 
000700302, Aragvi-Biznes Bank, Tbilisi. 
  Where is your headquarters and how can you be 
contacted? 
  The Georgian SDP is located in Tbilisi, at No 2 on 9 April 
Street. Our phones are 99-95-22 and 99-95-50. 
  We're hoping to meet you!

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister of Communications Vakhtang </F>
Todua by Mzia Narmania (Communications Ministry Press Center): 
"Much Has Been Done, Much Remains to Be Done. Protect and 
Safeguard Restored Communications Lines and Facilities"; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] The tragic events that have taken place 
recently in Samegrelo [Mingrelia], quite aside from terrible 
human and moral losses, have greatly damaged many economic 
sectors, including communications. Communications workers 
undertook restoration work as soon as the combat stopped. They 
worked very diligently, and often at the risk of their lives; 
they restored various connections and phone, television, and 
postal facilities. We asked Deputy Communications Minister 
Vakhtang Todua to answer a few questions on what has been done 
and what still has to be done. 
  [Narmania] Batono Vakhtang, you spent quite a long time in 
the Samegrelo region. What was the situation there and how much 
were you able to get done? 
  [Todua] First we went to Samtredia with a brigade of 
specialists; there we were joined by experienced local workers, 
and we immediately started working to restore inter-city 
telephone connections, television relay lines, and postal 
services. As for the situation, we found communications 
facilities so badly wrecked that we hardly knew where to begin. 
If it hadn't been for the Samegrelo regional provisional 
emergency committee's help it would have taken us a lot longer. 
The lack of fuel hurt us the worst. 
  We started in Samtredia and soon went to Abasha, then 
Senaki, 
Khobi, Zugdidi, Tsalendzhikha, Dzhvarzeni, Chkhorotsku, and 
Martvili. The most difficult section was 
Zugdidi-Tsalendzhikha-Dzhvarzeni, where restoration work is 
still going on. Thirty kilometers of cable were completely 
damaged or stolen; to replace it, the Ministry brought its last 
stocks of connecting cable to the site. We worked without let-up 
for almost two months. Let me emphasize once more that we were 
greatly aided by local cadres, especially Vani's communications 
workers. The local population also helped out; they did most of 
the dirty work, in snow, slush, and cold. Our heartfelt thanks 
to them. 
  [Narmania] We have already reported the work you have done 
in 
the Samegrelo region. How much money was spent, and does any 
particular factor stand out? 
  [Todua] The work cost about 150 million Russian rubles. It's 
a lot, but it's justified: any place there are no 
communications, you know, there is no state. So this money has 
been spent for the sake of independent Georgia's better future. 
As for your second question, we need to emphasize that the most 
important thing now is to deal properly with criminals of every 
kind in order to ensure that our country's very vital 
communications facilities are not destroyed again. 
  [Narmania] In your opinion, who does the most damage to our 
communications--the armed gangs who don't care about anything 
except making money by any means, the general population, or 
(forgive me for being so blunt) certain dishonest--to say the 
least--workers in your own system who know what is going on and 
where and therefore have easy access to booty? And, in your 
opinion, what must be done to stop this disgracefulness? 
  [Todua] Communications facilities are extremely vital, which 
is why we have held many meetings with the local population to 
explain the necessity of safeguarding them. The smooth operation 
of our facilities now plays an especially vital role. That's why 
Eduard Shevardnadze, when he was in the conflict zone, went 
first to the post offices and instructed us to restore their 
operation as soon as possible, also communications in the cities 
and villages. "That's the way to restore life to normal," he 
added. 
  That's the absolute truth, which is why we worked so 
tirelessly. That's why enemy forces tried to stop us and 
attacked our communications workers. If it hadn't been for the 
help provided by operations personnel of the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], we couldn't have done much. Still, unless a 
special service is created to provide reliable protection to 
communications, we'll still be in trouble. 
  [Narmania] You mentioned attacks. Were they very frequent? 
  [Todua] Quite frequent. One such attack occurred on the 
Zugdidi-Dzhvarzeni road where we were hauling equipment to 
repair a mast to restore television in Tsalendzhikha. A 20-man 
gang attacked us; they riddled our bus with bullets, disarmed 
our guards and took them prisoner, and forbade us to do the 
work. Despite these difficulties, we managed to complete some 
solid and important work, though not all of it. 
  [Narmania] Do you have much more work to do in Samegrelo? 
  [Todua] There's still a lot to do. We're doing everything we 
can to stock up on necessary materials and components, take them 
to the sites, and complete the rest of the restoration work.

"Russian Aftershock Inflation: How They Explain It and What They 
Plan to Do About It"] 
  [Text] Psychologists have a well-known recommendation: if 
you are tired of a small boy's endless "why's," tell him: 
because the perpendicular. The child will be stymied, and the 
questions will run out. If this doesn't help, distract him with 
a toy, and in the extreme case give him a slap. This 
psychological device is being applied rather successfully now to 
the mass consciousness. 
  Why has our country--a world exporter of energy that has 
freed itself not only from the burden of state orders for the 
military-industrial complex (nearly 20 percent of the GNP) but 
also from its role as donor to contiguous regions (another 20 
percent of the GNP)--fallen into utter impoverishment instead of 
flourishing economically? we ask yet again. Because, my dears, 
reforms have to be paid for, the agitprop warriors among our 
advisers, experts, commentators, and film directors have 
replied. Who must we pay and why isn't everyone paying? we ask 
again, puzzled. 
  The first parts of scenes like this are often played out now 
in the SMI [mass information media] when talk begins about the 
persistent aftershock inflation that has been going on for more 
than two years now, to the incessant music of promises of 
financial stabilization by the end of the quarter, the year, or 
the decade. A whole bouquet of agitprop replies to questions as 
to the causes of inflation has already been gathered. 
  An almost mystical and therefore extremely convincing 
response is contained in the president's message to parliament: 
"When price liberalization was deployed, the inflationary energy 
that had been building up for years burst to the surface." The 
flame of Vesuvius and Hiroshima, the wail and moan of the 
citizens! Right away we see that the Great Reformers had nothing 
to do with it. If someone is guilty, then it is Granddad Lenin 
and Trotskiy the Jew. 
  A very scientific "political-economic" answer is offered by 
M. Delyagin (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 24 February 1994): "The basic 
source of structural inflation is not the tendency of domestic 
prices toward world prices but the sale of inefficient 
monopoly-status enterprises in the processing industry." Also: 
"This is an inevitable process, the natural consequence of 
profound structural disproportions in the economy." From the 
standpoint of psychology, the reply is fairly successful, since 
in the mass consciousness a monopoly is a terrible thing from 
which you have to expect the very worst. He doesn't do as well 
with his proofs, which for some reason are cited in the form of 
two examples that relate to export-import restrictions, not 
inflation. 
  M. Delyagin evidently does not understand that if the export 
of oil is restricted by a special license quota and the export 
of processing industry goods is not restricted by anything, then 
the dynamics of their domestic prices have to be different. In 
exactly the same way, restrictions on the import of sugar 
inevitably lead to domestic prices exceeding the world price. 
The history of foreign trade relations is full of such examples 
of divergences between world and domestic prices, from the 
"bread laws" in England in the first half of the nineteenth 
century, according to which taxes were levied on the import of 
grain in order to support high domestic prices, to the so-called 
trade war between the United States and Japan going on today, 
which consists of the constant review of mutual restrictions on 
export-import operations. 
  If we are talking about so-called inefficient enterprises, 
then ignorance in tax assessment and foreign trade policy could 
bring even the most efficient branch to a halt, as happened 
recently here with the production of vodka. An increase in the 
excise from 0.85 to 0.9 raised the price of vodka by 50 percent 
and made it uncompetitive in comparison with imported vodka. It 
took the loss of hundreds of billions of rubles in excise duties 
for the authorities to realize this and correct their mistake. 
This example brilliantly illustrates the extreme superficiality 
of conducting propaganda discussions about Russia's inefficient 
processing industry in isolation from an analysis of taxation, 
export-import restrictions, wages, and transportation costs. 
  Actually, in agitprop political economy, it is all right to 
disdain not only the realia of life but also statistical facts. 
We are told as if it were an achievement that in the years 
1992-93 the purchasing power of the dollar in the Russian market 
fell by a factor of more than 12. Weekly observations of this 
indicator by the FinIst AO (joint-stock company), which are 
widely published in the business press, and the assessments of 
other independent sources give a figure closer to 5. Not a bad 
difference, is it? 
  This is the question that should be asked: If the 
explanations for inflation cited are nothing but psychological 
devices for working on the mass consciousness, then is it 
impossible to espy the author's intent? The plan set forth below 
has been tested with the help of a model based on real 
statistics. 
  The January price jump of 1992 not only moved the economic 
system to a point of equilibrium between supply and demand but 
destroyed, along with the population's savings, the circulating 
funds of enterprises, without which production is impossible. 
Instantly, money became a bottleneck, as a result of which, at 
the new point of equilibrium, the economic system became less 
productive and, accordingly, the tax base narrowed. 
  Simultaneously, the government transferred part of the 
state-owner's traditional income to private 
structures--commercial banks and export-import firms. This was 
done in order to create a social base to ensure support for the 
government. 
  The loss of state budgetary income and taxes immediately 
created a deficit that had to be covered by the emission of 
"extra" money. That is how aftershock inflation got started. 
Inflation ate into enterprises' already meager circulating 
funds, the volume of nonpayments grew to a quarter of the GNP, 
and it became necessary to carry out a mutual debt cancellation 
and compensate for the inflationary loss of circulating funds 
with credits, which required an additional emission of payment 
means. 
  The nightmare of what was going on was added to by the 
organization of the ruble zone, in which more than ten Central 
Banks were already competing in emission. 
  Therefore Ye.T. Gaydar is formally correct when he says that 
rates of aftershock inflation have been determined by the 
amounts of credit compensation for inflationary losses of 
circulating funds and by the deficit in the state budget for the 
financing of social systems. However, he says nothing about how 
aftershock therapy was started with his direct participation and 
why over the last two years all possible levers for 
stabilization have not been employed. 
  The political intention or mistakes in January are quite 
specific: the carrying out of a total price jump in a poor 
market without land outside the cities, real estate, or the 
means of production; the uncontrolled liberalization of foreign 
trade and foreign currency operations; the transfer of state 
income to private structures; the absence of a set, controllable 
mechanism of behavior for the directors of state enterprises; 
and the organization of the ruble zone. 
  Actually, these mistakes could still have been corrected, 
inasmuch as all reserves and levers of management were still in 
government hands. In order to evaluate these reserves, let us 
use official data, although they sometimes look simply 
anecdotal. For instance, it has been reported (ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA, 8 February 1994) that in 1993 the state budget deficit 
was 7 percent of the GNP and credits were 19 percent of the GNP. 
These figures correspond to an average monthly rate of inflation 
of about 13 percent, therefore they remain wholly on the 
conscience of the Ministry of Finance, if such a concept is 
allowable for a ministry. 
  If we are to believe the data of Goskomstat (State Committee 
for Statistics), then Russia's positive foreign trade balance in 
1992 totaled about 35 percent of the GNP (approximately 20 
percent was attributed to donor assistance to the former 
republics of the Soviet Union and 15 percent to the flight of 
hard currency capital abroad). In 1993, the same balance totaled 
approximately 23 percent of the GNP (12 and 11 percent, 
respectively). In these figures lies the quintessence of 
everything that the government has done. Here is the ruble zone, 
and the "humanitarian" supplies to friendly regimes, and the 
transfers of state income to private structures. The amounts of 
this foreign trade balance are such that it undoubtedly could 
have covered any real deficit in the state budget and, 
accordingly, cut off the road to inflation. Ye.T. Gaydar is 
correct when he writes that the inflationary rivers of the 
Central Bank dump into foreign commercial banks. He merely 
forgets to mention that it is the flight of capital to foreign 
commercial banks that is causing the inflationary flows out of 
the Central Bank, and the government has not only failed to 
fulfill its obligation to construct a dam on the course of these 
flows but has actually taken down what barriers there were. 
  What have the government and the Central Bank done in 1993? 
To the credit of the Central Bank, with the introduction of a 
Russian national currency, the ruble zone was eliminated, but 
the government continued to supply virtually free resources to 
the former republics of the Soviet Union, although it did reduce 
their volume by about 40 percent. Simultaneously, the government 
compensated with the help of loans for some of enterprises' 
inflationary losses, thus attempting to avert a collapse. The 
decline has continued, however, and the corresponding narrowing 
of the tax base has eaten into the economies made on donor 
assistance to the former republics. The government has utilized 
one other reserve: it has simply failed to pay salaries. Now the 
1994 administration has to pay the debts of the 1993 
administration. 
  Today three basic economic scenarios that are still possible 
without freezing prices and incomes are being examined. The 
first, harsh scenario proposes carrying out stabilization by 
liquidating the state budget deficit and compensation credits to 
enterprises at the expense of a final destruction of social 
systems and the processing industry. It is this scenario that 7 
percent of the voters voted for in the elections of 12 December, 
and the Russia's Choice faction represents it honorably in the 
State Duma. 
  The second scenario proposes a continuation of the policy of 
the latter half of 1993, that is, moderate selective 
compensation credits to enterprises and a continuation of the 
financial suffocation of the social systems, accompanied by a 
curtailment of donor assistance to the former Soviet republics. 
According to this scenario, the economic decline must continue 
and, accordingly, the tax base will narrow. The drop of national 
income into the state budget will have to be compensated for 
either by new emission, that is, increased inflation, or at the 
expense of further cuts in donor assistance to the former 
republics. This development, however, cannot continue for more 
than a year, since the sources of its existence (allowable 
amounts of inflation and cuts in donor assistance) will come to 
an end. Real stabilization is not to be seen here. 
  Finally, the third scenario proposes quick stabilization at 
the expense of total utilization of all the above-described 
reserves, that is, a simultaneous halt in the flight of capital 
and in donor assistance. Carrying out this scenario requires not 
only a strong but also a well-qualified government, which Russia 
has not had since the days of Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin. 
  It goes without saying that each of these scenarios risks 
specific social and political consequences (strikes, civil 
disobedience, sabotage, a change of regimes in contiguous 
territories, separatism, requests for reunification, and so on). 
Therefore, each of these scenarios could be cut short or altered 
by sufficiently powerful social groups. 
  In conclusion, I want to emphasize that what has been said 
here, the ideas and assessments, are by no means unique. Various 
experts using various methods have, independently of one 
another, come to the same conclusions at various times. 
Therefore I will conclude with a quotation from an article by an 
economic advisor to the Labor group in the British Parliament, 
John Rossi (DELOVOY MIR, 21-27 February 1994): "Crisis has come 
about only because, in complete contradiction of its national 
interests and economic logic, Russia has allowed an export of 
capital in the amount of approximately $30 billion at the very 
moment when it had a large international indebtedness and a huge 
demand for resources for capital investment into its own economy 
and for financing the budget deficit."

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "The Deindustrialization of </F>
Russia Has Already Become a Reality, but Practically All of the 
Theses of the President's `State of Nation' Message Coincide 
With the Recommendations of Parliamentary Hearings on Economic 
Policy, Believes Sergey Glazyev"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Analysis </H5>
  After such major events as the campaign for amnesty, 
the long-awaited presidential "State of Nation" message for many 
suddenly stopped being perceived as something that was 
unquestionably important and even definitive, having "drowned" 
in political routine business. 
  However, this does not mean that there are no 
politicians who ascribe a paramount role to the content of the 
message. An analysis of the "compatibility" of the positions of 
the president and parliament, conducted by Sergey Glazyev in an 
interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, is an example of this. 
  Glazyev not only comes to interesting conclusions, but 
he also shares some of the optimism of the president's 
message--not in an assessment of the economic situation, but in 
Boris Yeltsin's arrangement of priorities and in the spirit of 
the message, which, in his opinion, makes it possible to hope 
for constructive cooperation (the chairman of a Duma committee 
thinks that the most important priorities are the conduct of an 
active structural policy, the stimulation of the formation of 
financial-industrial groups, a mechanism for real control over 
state property and the creation of institutions of social 
partnership, and reform of the tax system). 
  The president's message on economic policy priorities that 
was presented last week to the Federal Assembly is very close to 
the recommendations that were developed by the economic policy 
committee in parliamentary hearings on 10 February, believes 
Sergey Glazyev. Although, in his words, there are several rather 
serious differences between the position of the president and 
parliament. 
  In particular, there is a serious difference in the 
assessment of the current state of the economy. The president is 
far more optimistic. "One of the main theses of the message 
which relates to the economy states that we have moved away from 
the edge of the abyss. As for our conclusions, which we made on 
the basis of materials of the government and independent 
experts, for us it is evident that we have entered into a state 
of catastrophe. Perhaps the situation in society obliges the 
president to come out with optimistic positions." 
  One other difference, according to Glazyev, is the need to 
depart from stereotypes in explaining the economic difficulties 
as a fight between the supporters and opponents of reform. "The 
hearings in the State Duma have shown that there is no kind of 
`class struggle' around the most important directions of 
economic policy." 
  However, Sergey Glazyev thinks that it is much more fruitful 
to examine the "positive" theses of the report, which propose 
specific measures for the resolution of problems and not only an 
assessment of today's situation. 
  For example, the report sets the near-term task of 
developing 
a law that clearly establishes the rules of functioning of state 
organs, first and foremost of the executive authority. But the 
Duma is also seriously troubled today by the absence of any kind 
of responsibility for the management of state property. "The 
committee for the management of state property is engaged in 
everything but the administration of state property--in fact, 
tasks for the effective administration of state property have 
generally dropped out of the spheres of interest of the 
government. The main task is considered to be the distribution 
of state property, regardless of whether it is effective or not 
and whether it is economically justified. State property does 
not bring incomes, and even its privatization in 1993 and 1994 
gives a figure that is surprisingly close to zero. In addition, 
the state, instead of receiving incomes from its property, 
increases the tax burden, suppressing economic growth and the 
private sector, for the sake of which, by the way, privatization 
is being conducted." 
  It is for these reasons that the Duma is now engaged first 
and foremost in the development of the laws "On Public Property" 
and "On the Administration of State Property." It is important 
in these laws to clearly establish the responsibility of the 
government for the implementation both of functional tasks (such 
as, for example, support of the infrastructure) as well as tasks 
in the income sphere. "The further spontaneous squandering of 
property simply is impermissible under conditions of a sharp 
reduction in the income part of the budget, and we hope that 
order will finally be brought to this sphere in 1944, as well as 
to the sphere of distribution of state credits and export 
quotas." 
  The very same thing concerns the presidential position on 
replacing an authorized right by a notifying right. "There is 
probably not one businessman who would not severely criticize 
bureaucratic arbitrariness in the resolution of entrepreneurial 
activity. State interference has to be justified from a position 
of economic effectiveness." In the law that the Duma is 
preparing, according to Glazyev's words, it is the notifying 
principle that will become the basis of economic activity so 
that the development of small business would be the norm (by 
making penetration of the market easier), and state regulation 
would concern only public interests and the guarantee of 
legality. 
  What is more, this task, in the opinion of the chairman of 
the committee for economic policy, can be evaluated even more 
highly than privatization. There are many enterprises that it 
makes no sense to privatize--they are not efficient, and they 
cannot avoid bankruptcy and readjustment. Nonetheless, the 
government will have to be concerned about them. Far more 
important is the formation of new enterprises that emerge 
straight off according to the laws of the market. In the last 
two years, this sector of work was abandoned--naturally, instead 
of a market system, we acquired an extremely confused system of 
property relations, which is rather reminiscent of the Yugoslav 
model. 
  The Civil Code also has the very same coincidence of 
priorities, Glazyev believes. "The absence of reliable legal 
principles at the micro level today is the main obstacle to 
rationalization of all of economic life: The lack of necessary 
mechanisms of responsibility leads to chaos at the micro level, 
which also gives rise to `macro chaos'--inflation, nonpayments, 
and the like." The Duma is ready even to apply the Civil Code in 
parts. 
  "It should be acknowledged that in many ways the law 
enforcement organs are passive with respect to the fight against 
unfair competition, deception, illegal advertising, and 
corruption--this is associated in part with problems in 
legislation." The fact that this problem was highlighted in the 
president's message speaks not only of the logical coincidence 
of positions, but also of the significance of this problem." 
  In Glazyev's opinion, however, it is not only the 
legislative 
"holes" that are to blame for the passivity of law enforcement 
organs, but also simply the careless fulfillment of 
responsibilities. Such as, for example, the continuous 
advertising of the export of capital, and other violations of 
legislation. "When I was still working for the MVES [Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations], I made inquiries of the MB 
[Ministry of Security] regarding the suppression of 
advertisements of criminal activities in the mass media, but I 
did not receive anything intelligible from there." 
  In the section "On Personal Security," Glazyev sees much 
that 
is similar, especially in the guarantee of health services. 
"Practically all of the parties in the Duma note the need to 
form a rational system of compulsory medical insurance." This 
also concerns the involvement of Russian enterprises in the 
production of modern medicines. "I introduced a proposal to 
prohibit the allocation of state resources for the import of 
equipment that is produced in Russia, but I did not find any 
support," says Glazyev. The expenditure of taxpayers' money 
should be for investment in economic growth in the country. 
When, owing to this money, a stimulation of imports occurs, 
this, in Glazyev's opinion, cannot be justified either from a 
common-sense standpoint or from the standpoint of economic 
theory. "We intend to make amendments to the law `On Supplies of 
Products and Commodities for State Needs,' which will limit 
opportunities for using state budget resources for the purchase 
of foreign goods, thereby bringing our rules into conformity 
with world practice." Although, in Glazyev's opinion, this 
concerns not only the central, but also the regional budgets. An 
example of this are imported luxury cars, whose purchase is made 
by regional organs of authority against a background of slogans 
about support for domestic producers. 
  According to the section "On Federalism," there is also much 
that is in common: In the words of the former minister, the Duma 
will work on the law on demarcating tax payments, legislation on 
local self-government, and the guarantee of territorial 
justice--all of this is in the plan of priority legislative 
work. The sole difference with the president's message is 
here--the harsh attitude toward treaties between the Federation 
and its subjects. According to Glazyev's information, many in 
the State Duma think that such treaties are dangerous. "The 
treaties signed with a number of subjects of the Federation in 
1992-1993 became the basis for disintegration processes and 
demands for privileges and concessions in trade policy and in 
foreign economic activity, which it is impossible to do if, of 
course, we view Russia as a state with a single economic space 
(as the president does in his message). In my opinion, this 
development of internal treaty processes should be avoided." 
  The Duma will unquestionably support the process of review 
of 
privileges of individual territories that infringe on the rights 
of other regions and their populations. "However, the need for 
this, it was stated in the president's message, does not in any 
way attach to the recent edict, for example, concerning 
Kaliningrad Oblast." 
  Yeltsin's proposal on tax reform coincides with the 
positions 
of many Duma deputies. "The president's message talks about the 
fact that rent can become an important source of incomes. This 
is one of the conclusions of the economic conference that was 
considered in the Duma and which consists in the need to 
increase the role of rental payments in the incomes of the 
federal and regional budgets." 
  Many theses and corresponding recommendations on 
parliamentary relations are contained in the section "Toward a 
Social State Through a Market Economy." "This, naturally, is an 
increase in investment activity and the need to conduct a 
structural restructuring. We also intend to adopt the laws `On 
Foreign Economic Activity,' `On State Scientific-Technical 
Policy,' `On Non-Commercial Organizations,' and `On State 
Support of Small Business'--I already spoke earlier about 
several other congruences." 
  In Glazyev's words, the Duma will support the reform of the 
account system in the Central Bank. In particular, an 
examination will be made of the laws "On Banks and Banking 
Activity" and "On the Central Bank of Russia." "The thesis 
contained in the report concerning the FRS [Federal Reserve 
System], of course, needs serious analysis and detailed 
deciphering, because there could be absolutely different models 
of organization behind the words `Federal Reserve System'--both 
in the configuration of the reserve banks and in their mutual 
relations." 
  The thesis on the need to establish financial-industrial 
groups aroused Glazyev's particular attention. In Glazyev's 
opinion, this is the only realistic method today of overcoming 
the break between the industrial and banking sectors. "In 
1992-1993, the banking system developed separately from 
industry, and it financed trade. The further parallel existence 
of capital and industrial enterprises is simply impossible. This 
is first. Second, the privatization program has led to a break 
in many highly technological production chains, both vertically 
and horizontally. The result was an increase in the sources of 
inflation at a micro level. We did not achieve the elimination 
of monopolism in the economy, but then we lost control, because 
we took the path of breaking up the monopolistic enterprises. 
Acceleration in the creation of FPG's [financial industrial 
groups] is not only a necessary condition for achieving 
competitiveness for Russian products on the world market, but 
also for the achievement of macro-economic stabilization. This 
point of view is shared by a majority in industrial and in 
scientific circles--and it finds complete understanding in the 
State Duma." 
  But if this thesis of the presidential message is followed, 
then, as Glazyev thinks, "We will have to make a lot of changes 
in the state privatization program. If the government conducts 
the policy of the president, then it must go along with these 
changes. We await a more considered approach to privatization 
this year, and we hope that this work will move in contact with 
the Federal Assembly (in accordance with the law, privatization 
programs should have the status of federal laws, and not 
presidential edicts)." 
  In Glazyev's opinion, in the part on the redesign of the tax 
system, it is possible to ascertain almost a complete congruence 
both with the position of the economic conference and with the 
recommendations of the parliamentary hearings. The same applies 
to the remarks of the president on the support of 
science-intensive industry. 
  "Those spheres of the scientific-industrial complex that 
could become the support of our economic growth are the ones 
today that are the most exposed to destructive tendencies." In 
this sense, the differences in the evaluation of the situation 
in the country are quite fundamental for Glazyev. He thinks that 
the irreversible "de-industrialization" of the country is 
already moving at full speed: "We will not be able to 
reestablish much of the science-intensive production, and we 
have already lost substantial reserves of future economic 
growth. The reckoning is literally in months--if emergency 
measures to support science-intensive industry are not adopted 
in the near term, then we could lose the prospect of growth or 
even a partial restoration for all time--we will enter the zone 
of a prolonged structural depression with the absence of any 
kind of growth for a decade." Glazyev thinks that the passivity 
of the government is "simply incomprehensible." For example, it 
is not known to this day, however, whether the program for the 
support of science-intensive exports, which was expected since 
the middle of 1993, is included in the budget message for 1994. 
The same applies to the president's initiative on social 
partnership. 
  The Duma, according to Sergey Glazyev's words, is ready for 
constructive work with the government to which a "majority in 
the State Duma can render support in exchange for a clear and 
reasonable program for leading the economy out of the crisis." 
Thus, the memorandum of accord, which the Duma adopted in a 
package with the decree on amnesty, contains a decree on the 
need to conduct "roundtables" on economic and social policy "for 
the purpose of developing a national accord on the main 
directions of economic policy." However, Glazyev thinks that not 
everyone in the apparatus of the executive branch is ready for 
this. 
  The former minister notes the characteristic refusals of the 
president's administration to give a basis for the edicts that 
were submitted for review by the Federal Assembly. "Apparently, 
it is necessary to bring order in the president's administration 
in the sense of implementing the political line of the chief of 
state"--Glazyev hopes that since the president's message came 
out, there will be fewer possibilities for sabotage among the 
workers of the administration. "If, of course, the leaders of 
the administration of the president this time treat the line of 
the president seriously and do not replace it with their own 
interests." 
  Glazyev thinks that for today the main problem is 
implementation of the coordinated priorities of economic policy, 
in which the Duma will assist the government in every possible 
way. However, in his opinion, the monitoring functions of the 
State Duma should also not be forgotten and, based on the task 
of their implementation, the Duma also requires publication of 
the government program--the "Workers' Program" that exists today 
for the implementation of priorities established by the 
president and the State Duma is obviously inadequate. 
  According to Glazyev, the government program should include 
not only a list of decrees that must be adopted without fail, 
but also specific indicators and parameters for the desired 
condition of the economy of the country, and also the planned 
indicators for those departments that are engaged in the 
management of state property. Glazyev also believes that a 
system of monitoring the results of the economic policy being 
conducted should be provided.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "At the Russian Federation </F>
Government" rubric: "A Decree `On the State of the Russian 
Economy and the Prospects for Its Development in 1994' Adopted 
on Results of 4 March 1994 Enlarged Session of Russian 
Government"] 
  [Text] The decree notes that implementation of the 
formulated course of economic transformations continued in 1993. 
The government's efforts were concentrated on pursuing a 
moderately tough monetary-credit policy, continuing the process 
of privatization, implementing a package of measures to provide 
the population with social support, broadening the autonomy of 
the regions, carrying out institutional transformations, 
developing relations with the CIS member states, and further 
liberalizing foreign economic activity. 
  However, a number of important tasks in the socioeconomic 
sphere were not tackled. Last year negative trends persisted, 
manifesting themselves in a decline in industrial and 
agricultural production, stoppages at many enterprises, 
continuing financial crisis, a marked drop in investment 
activity, the preservation of an irrational national economic 
structure, and a drop in the standard of living of certain 
population groups. The situation did not improve in January and 
February 1994. 
  The government is caused particular concern by problems 
linked with the untimely payment of wages, the drastic 
deterioration in enterprises' solvency, the continuing high 
level of inflation, and the increase in crime. 
  The adoption of the Russian Federation [RF] Constitution by 
national ballot 12 December 1993 created the preconditions for 
the continuation and development of economic reform based on 
coordinated interaction between Russian legislative and 
executive bodies. 
  The government sees its main task as being to ensure the 
fulfillment in 1994 of the RF Council of Ministers-Government 
Program for 1993-1995 "Developing Reforms and Stabilizing the 
Russian Economy." 
  With a view to performing this task federal executive bodies 
and executive bodies in RF components, guided by the provisions 
of the RF president's Message to the Federal Assembly "On 
Strengthening the Russian State (Basic Guidelines of Domestic 
and Foreign Policy)," have been tasked with formulating and 
implementing measures designed to raise the population's 
standard of living, ensure the timely payment of wages, reduce 
the rate of inflation, resolve the problem of nonpayment, 
stabilize and increase industrial and agricultural production, 
enhance the effectiveness of foreign economic activity, 
strengthen the CIS, provide incentives for investment activity 
and enlisting foreign investments, develop a competitive 
environment, speed up institutional transformations, and improve 
the structure of the national economy and the system of state 
government. 
  The government has approved a plan for top-priority measures 
to be implemented in accordance with the president's Message to 
the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State (Basic 
Guidelines of Domestic and Foreign Policy)." 
  The plan includes the drafting as soon as possible of 
concrete normative acts -- draft laws, RF presidential edicts, 
and government decrees designed to tackle social and regional 
problems, questions of monetary-credit policy, institutional and 
structural transformations, agrarian policy, foreign economic 
activity, defense of citizens' rights and freedoms, and the 
fight against crime. 
  The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of 
Finance, the Russian Ministry of Science and Technology Policy, 
the Russian State Committee for Industrial Policy, and the 
Russian Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, 
jointly with other interested federal executive bodies and 
executive bodies of RF components, have been asked to finish 
shaping by 1 April 1994 the federal targeted programs adopted 
for funding, allowing for the volume of funds for which the 1994 
Federal Budget makes provision. 
  The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of 
Finance, and the Russian Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and 
Regional Policy have been instructed to submit to the government 
a revised forecast for RF socioeconomic development in 1994 for 
submission to the State Duma at the same time as the 1994 draft 
federal budget. 
  When elaborating the forecasts the Russian Ministry of the 
Economy must take into consideration the possible options for 
the country's socioeconomic development mindful of the 
prevailing situation. 
  In view of the broadening of the rights and powers of RF 
components in line with the RF Constitution and generalizing the 
experience of the change in relations between the federal budget 
and the budgets of RF components based on the principle of 
budgetary federalism, the Russian Ministry of Finance and the 
Russian Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy 
must submit to the government by 1 September 1994 proposals 
regarding the development of the RF budgetary system in 1995 
that envisage the further improvement in the procedure for the 
compilation, examination, ratification, and implementation of 
budgets of all levels, the use of unified budget classification, 
treasury implementation of budgets [kaznacheyskoye ispolneniye 
byudzhetov], and the strengthening of budgetary discipline. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance, the Russian Ministry of the 
Economy, the Russian Ministry of Labor, the Russian Ministry of 
Justice, and the Russian State Tax Service must submit to the 
government within two months proposals regarding the improvement 
of the tax system which will make it possible to boost the 
effectiveness of its regulating effect on the economy, reduce 
the excessive differentiation of the population's incomes, and 
ensure that budgets receive full payment of taxes (levies and 
other payments). 
  In view of the countless cases of tax evasion, the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, the Russian State Tax Service, and the 
Russian Tax Police Department, jointly with the Central Bank of 
Russia, have been instructed to finalize within two weeks 
proposals previously submitted to the government on urgent 
measures to ensure that budgets receive mandatory payments in 
full and on time in 1994 in order that these proposals can be 
submitted to the State Duma for examination. 
  The RF Government has instructed the Russian Ministry of 
Finance to pay in March 1994 the 1993 federal budget arrears 
envisaged in budget spending for the first quarter of 1994. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance, jointly with the Central 
Bank of Russia, is to submit to the government within a month 
proposals on enlisting spare cash from corporate entities, 
including commercial banks, and the population for investment in 
the production of goods (services). 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance has been asked to step up 
supervision to ensure that budget appropriations reach their 
recipients and are used for their designated purpose and submit 
a corresponding monthly report to the government. 
  The Government Commission on Questions of Credit Policy must 
supervise the timely allocation and effective use, as well as 
the repayment of centralized credit resources and regularly 
report to the government. 
  The Central Bank of Russia, jointly with the Russian 
Ministry 
of Finance and the Russian Ministry of the Economy, must examine 
the state of settlements in the national economy and submit 
proposals within two weeks to the government on improving these 
settlements and also on boosting banks' responsibility for the 
timely implementation of payments and completing the work 
connected with the fulfillment of RF Presidential Edict No. 1662 
of 19 October 1993 "On Improving Settlements in the Economy and 
Boosting Responsibility for Their Timely Implementation." 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance and the Russian Ministry of 
the Economy, jointly with the Central Bank of Russia, have been 
instructed to submit to the government within two weeks 
proposals regarding the improvement of the procedure for 
examining and analyzing the state of payment discipline and 
settlements within sectors of the national economy and also with 
CIS member states. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance, the Russian Ministry of 
Labor, the Russian State Tax Service, and the Russian Federal 
Property Fund, jointly with the Central Bank of Russia, must 
establish within two weeks the procedure for transferring into 
enterprises' accounts to ensure that workers are paid regularly. 
  The Russian State Committee for the Management of State 
Property and the Russian State Committee for Labor and Social 
Problems have been tasked with examining questions regarding the 
professional suitability of leaders of state or floated 
enterprises, the controlling package of shares in which is in 
federal ownership, mindful of whether they ensure the timely 
payment of workers' wages. 
  The Russian Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional 
Policy, the Russian Ministry of Justice, the Russian Ministry of 
the Economy, the Russian Ministry of Finance, and the Russian 
State Committee for the Management of State Property, jointly 
with interested federal executive bodies and executive bodies of 
RF components must submit to the government within two months 
proposals regarding the demarcation of powers between federal 
executive bodies and executive bodies of RF components in 
accordance with the RF Constitution. 
  The Russian Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, and the Russian Ministry of the Economy 
with the participation of the Central Bank of Russia must ensure 
the rigorously targeted and effective use of the credit 
resources allocated to the agro-industrial complex in accordance 
with RF Government Decree No. 126 of 23 February 1994 "On the 
Economic Conditions for the Functioning of the RF 
Agro-Industrial Complex in 1994." 
  The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food, and the Russian Ministry of Finance have 
been tasked with submitting to the government by 15 April 1994 
proposals regarding the procedure for state procurements of 
grain from the 1994 harvest for federal and regional stocks. 
  The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of 
Fuel and Energy, the Russian Ministry of Railways, and the 
Russian Ministry of Finance have been instructed to submit to 
the government within two weeks proposals regarding the 
improvement of the system of regulated prices and tariffs for 
electricity and railroad transport services. 
  The RF Government deemed it necessary to create conditions 
for the formation in 1994 of financial-industrial groups with a 
view to stabilizing and boosting industrial production, 
enhancing investment activity, and making more effective use of 
the achievements of scientific and technical progress for which 
the Russian State Committee for Industrial Policy, the Russian 
State Committee for the Management of State Property, the 
Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of 
Finance, the Russian Ministry for Cooperation With CIS Member 
States, and the Russian State Committee for Anti-Monopoly Policy 
and Support of the New Economic Structures must submit to the 
government proposals regarding priority areas for the creation 
of financial-industrial groups. 
  In order to revise the concept for the implementation of 
privatization in the RF in connection with the end of the period 
of validity of privatization checks 1 July 1994 the following 
instructions have been given: 
  --the Russian State Committee for the Management of State 
Property, jointly with interested federal executive bodies, has 
been instructed to prepare a draft government decree which makes 
provision for a series of measures to complete check 
privatization and provide RF citizens with guarantees of the use 
of privatization checks; 
  --create a commission chaired by A.B. Chubays, deputy 
chairman of the RF Government, with the participation of 
representatives of federal executive bodies, executive bodies of 
RF components, scientists, and specialists to formulate a 
mechanism for the implementation of privatization once 
privatization checks are no longer valid. The commission is to 
submit the corresponding proposals to the government by 1 May 
1994. 
  The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian State Tax 
Service, the Russian State Committee for Industrial Policy, the 
Russian Ministry of Finance, and the Russian Federal Property

[kazennyy] enterprises. 
  The Russian State Committee for the Management of State 
Property, the Russian State Committee for Anti-Monopoly Policy 
and Support of the New Economic Structures, the Russian State 
Committee for Industrial Policy, the Russian Ministry of Labor, 
and the Russian Ministry of Justice have been asked to establish 
the procedure for the performance of official duties by 
personnel of executive bodies who take part on behalf of the 
state in the management bodies of joint-stock companies created 
during the privatization of state enterprises. 
  The Russian State Committee for the Management of State 
Property, the Russian Ministry of Justice, the Russian Ministry 
of the Economy, and the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] have been instructed to submit proposals to the 
government within two months regarding amendments and addenda to 
current legislation to provide guarantees and protection for the 
right of ownership. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance, the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, the Russian Ministry of the Economy,

State Tax Service must analyze the validity and effectiveness of 
the use in 1993-1994 of concessions granted to certain RF 
components and enterprises and submit proposals within the month 
to the government on streamlining these concessions. 
  The RF Government approved the draft Basic Guidelines of RF 
Social Policy in 1994 and instructed the Russian Ministry of 
Labor, the Russian Ministry of Social Protection of the 
Population, the Russian Ministry of Finance, the Russian 
Ministry of the Economy, and the Russian Ministry of Agriculture 
and Food, with the participation of other interested federal 
executive bodies, to finalize the above draft with consideration 
for the discussion that took place at the government session and 
submit it to the government within two weeks with the requisite 
calculations and validation. 
  The Russian Federal Employment Service, the Russian Ministry 
of Labor, the Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian 
Ministry of Social Protection of the Population, and the Russian 
Ministry of Finance have been instructed, when preparing the RF 
federal employment aid program for 1994, to make provision for 
the creation of an effective system of public works along with 
incentives to attract private capital into this sphere. 
  The Russian Ministry for Cooperation With CIS Member States, 
the Russian Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Ministry of the 
Economy must submit to the government by 1 June 1994 proposals 
regarding the further development and strengthening of the 
Economic Union of the CIS States.

Stabilizing the Russian Economy" Program and the plan of RF 
Government top-priority measures to be implemented in accordance 
with the RF presidential Message to the Federal Assembly "On 
Strengthening the Russian State (Basic Guidelines of Domestic 
and Foreign Policy)" as well as the generalization and monthly 
submission of this information to the government. 
  Federal executive bodies and executive bodies of RF 
components have been tasked with submitting a report to the

<H3>  I. Determination of the Comparative Attractiveness of 
Regions for Embarking on Banking Operations by the Index Method </H3>
<H5>  1.1. General Approaches </H5>
  In comparing conditions for banking operations in various 
regions, we may distinguish three key factors that determine a 
favorable outlook for embarking on banking operations within 
them. 
  First, we should name a volume of financial flows 
that should be sufficient for it to make sense for a banking 
institution to be established to service them. However, the 
volume of financial flows in and of itself indicates nothing: 
Given an insignificant number of banking institutions, even 
small gross flows may turn out to be sufficient to ensure the 
prosperity of a new bank or branch. 
  This is why it is not the absolute volume but rather the 
concentration of financial flows which is the most 
important factor, i.e., the average volume of such flows per one 
banking institution already existing in the region. The 
significance of this factor is associated with the fact that the 
banking institution being established will be able to operate 
only if it succeeds in attracting a proportion of the clientele 
of already existing banks and branches. 
  At present, a paradoxical situation is observed in Russia as 
a consequence of the insufficient development of the banking 
system and the attendant low level of competition: the larger 
the bank, the greater the indifference with which it treats its 
clients, and the more easily the latter "break away" from it. 
Indeed, a small bank, as a rule, services its founders. It 
hardly has clients besides these. The provision of highly 
specialized services is the only point that may draw the 
founders away from the bank they fully control, but both the 
need for such services and the number of banks capable of 
providing them are relatively small. 
  At the same time, a large bank virtually does not depend on 
its depositors and does not strive to keep them at any price. As 
a rule, relative indifference and comparatively high fees for 
services result (of course, there are exceptions; however, the 
headlong progress of banks that violate this rule goes precisely 
to confirm that it is correct with regard to the banking system 
of Russia as a whole). It would be fitting to recall here that, 
having gained considerable authority, some of the largest 
Russian banks mounted entire campaigns to get rid of small and, 
therefore, less profitable clients by deliberately creating 
unbearable conditions for servicing them. 
  As a result, the greater the concentration of financial 
resources at the banking institutions of a given region, the 
more amenable these resources are to reorientation toward new 
banks and branches. The above rule is a general rule for all 
market economies, although in less rigid form: High 
concentration is inseparably linked to an entire complex of 
phenomena which create prerequisites for the development of 
successful competition. In the absence of this, any market 
economy would be crushed by monopoly practices. 
  Going back to the banking system of Russia, we should stress 
that the described indicators--the volume and concentration of 
financial flows--do not reflect an entire complex of factors, 
some of which, in principle, cannot be quantified. Crucial 
factors, such as the level of development of infrastructure 
(virtually the most significant factor for banking operations!), 
the availability of skilled personnel, and the attitude of local 
authorities can be taken into account only through a resultant 
indicator testifying to their total, combined impact, rather 
than directly. 
  The number of branches that have already been 
created in the territory in question is such an indicator. The 
latter makes no sense in the absence of accounting for the two 
previous factors because it shows solely the propensities that 
prevailed in the past without factoring in the economic 
foundation on which these propensities rested. As a result, the 
mistakes of the past will become self-sustaining: For example, 
the extensive establishment of branches in a territory with 
insignificant financial flows as a result of particular 
subjective mistakes will create an illusion of extraordinary 
attractiveness, despite the fact that these branches eke out a 
pitiful existence. 
  The enumerated factors characterize either the operational 
conditions that are external to the banking system (the volume 
of financial flows and, in part, the number of branches), or the 
quantitative aspect of the system's own development 
(concentration of financial flows and, in part, the number of 
branches). The qualitative aspect of development of the system, 
i.e. the depth of specialization of the banking institutions and 
the complexity of operations performed by them, are actually 
left out of our field of vision. 
  To remedy this shortcoming, it would suffice to recall that, 
as a rule, sophisticated specialized banking operations are not 
associated with the immediate servicing of tangible flows. 
Therefore, the proportion of operations associated with the 
immediate servicing of tangible flows in the overall volume of 
operations of banking establishments will indicate the level of 
qualitative development of the banking system. We will 
conventionally call this indicator "the proportion of 
nonfinancial operations." 
  The above interconnected and interdependent factors which 
determine the conditions for banking activities in various 
regions make it possible to arrive at a generalized indicator of 
attractiveness of a particular territory even on the basis of 
existing imperfect statistics. 
<H3>  1.2. Indexes of the Scale and Concentration of Financial 
Flows, Level of Development of Branches, and Proportion of 
Nonfinancial Operations </H3>
  The greatest difficulties in undertaking the present effort 
are associated with the absence, in principle, of information on 
the strength of financial flows. Information on the size of 
regional bank assets provided by the Central Bank of Russia is 
suitable only with reservations because it applies to the assets 
of banks registered in a given territory, regardless of where 
they engage in operations. 
  Distortions caused by this are most vividly apparent in the 
case of Moscow, to which the assets of former specialized and 
sectoral banks that have kept a considerable chain of branches 
and service territories quite far removed from Moscow are 
attributed. With a view to getting rid of this shortcoming, the 
size of bank assets has to be adjusted by taking into account a 
number of indirect indicators that point up various components 
of financial flows in the process of determining the index 
of financial flows. 
  The index of concentration of financial flows, 
which describes the difference between volume of the average 
financial flows per one banking institution (bank or branch) in 
the region in question and the average Russian level, was 
determined in a similar manner. 
  The indexes of the number of branches and proportion of 
nonfinancial operations were determined directly, by 
comparing the number of branches registered in a given region 
(or, respectively, the proportion of nonfinancial operations in 
the total volume of operations of banking institutions in a 
given region) with the average Russian level. 
  All the described indexes amount to deviations of the 
relevant indicators from the average Russian level, which is 
assumed to be 100 percent. 
<H3>  1.3. Comparative Index of Attractiveness of Conditions for 
Banking Operations </H3>
  In working with the present publication, it is most 
important 
for the user to grasp the fact that, depending on the situation 
of his bank and its development strategy determined by this 
situation, the significance of some of the factors described 
above may vary. 
  After all, the index of attractiveness of conditions for 
banking operations as determined by us is subjective in nature: 
It depends not only on conditions within the region, but also on 
the potential of whoever wants to develop the region. 
  Only the indexes of the volume and concentration of 
financial 
flows amount to unequivocal indicators: A rise in them 
unequivocally indicates easier banking expansion in the region 
in question and, consequently, there is a direct correlation 
between their value and the value of the resultant index. 
  However, we encounter the first exception right there. 
Understandably, the comparatively low number of branches is 
predicated on the effect of various counteracting 
factors--difficult climatic and geographic conditions, 
inadequately developed infrastructure, shortage of cadres, 
paternalistic stance of the local authorities, and so on. 
  It is also understandable that, in principle, the negative 
influence of any of these factors may be overcome by making 
financial outlays. A bank that incurs such outlays and overcomes 
the counteracting factors will gain an exceptionally favorable 
position, virtually that of a monopoly in the region in 
question. This is precisely the kind of situation about which 
they say that "Paris is well worth a mass." 
  For a bank that is prepared to incur the aforementioned 
outlays, it is the relatively small rather than the large number 
of branches registered in the region that is the sign of 
comparative attractiveness of the region (naturally, all other 
conditions being equal). 
  The correlation between the index of the number of branches 
and the comparative index of attractiveness of conditions for 
banking operations is also inverse rather than direct. 
  The index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations, 
which 
describes the depth of specialization in the banking system and 
thus the quality of its development, should also be considered 
an "ambiguous" indicator. 
  On one hand, to most banks a high level of development of 
the 
banking system offers extensive potential for finding their own 
"ecological niche" and enhances the attractiveness of a region. 
For these banks, the correlation between the proportion of 
nonfinancial operations and the resultant index is inverse. 
  On the other hand, banks that are capable of not just taking 
advantage of the results of a high development of the banking 
system but also of acting as locomotives of this development 
will gain the greatest advantage precisely in the course of 
penetrating regions with a low level of specialization of 
banking institutions (of course, all other conditions being 
equal). They have an opportunity to shape the banking system of 
the region "to their specifications" from the very beginning and 
to ensure their leading role in the region for a long time to 
come. 
  In the present work, we proceed from the most typical case 
whereby a bank establishing branches sets the goal of taking 
advantage of already existing conditions for operations rather 
than purposefully transforming them. Given this strategy of 
establishing branches, the correlation between the indexes of 
the volume and concentration of financial flows, as well as the 
index of the number of branches, and the resultant comparative 
index of attractiveness for banking operations is direct, and 
between the index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations 
and the resultant index--inverse. 
  Accordingly, the comparative index of attractiveness of 
conditions for banking operations amounts to a geometric mean of 
the first three indexes and a value inverse to the fourth 
index. 
  However, we do not rule out the possibility that banks 
subscribing to a different approach to the establishment of 
branches will turn to the present work. We are including in 
Table 1 provided below not only the resultant indicator but also 
all the base indicators used to compute it in order to give such 
banks an opportunity to modify the calculations made by us in 
keeping with the needs of their organizations. 
  Therefore, the table in a way amounts to a construction set 
proceeding from which each manager may independently calculate 
various scenarios of policy concerning branches.

Note 1. The higher the index of comparative conditions for banking operations, the more 
favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region under consideration is from 
the point of view of establishing branches. 

Note 2. As the table suggests, worse than average conditions for banking operations have 
developed in most regions. The reason is found in the concentration of banks in Moscow, which 
has caused a gap in the level of development of the banking system and, accordingly, 
conditions for banking operations that have developed in these few areas and those in the 
entire remaining territory of Russia. 


<H5>  II. Regional Dynamics of Development of the Banking System </H5>
<H3>  2.1. Quarterly Dynamics of the Comparative Index of 
Attractiveness of Conditions for Banking Operations in the 
Economic Regions of Russia </H3>
  The assumption that the conditions for economic operations 
in 
various regions would gradually become uniform as market 
relations develop was one of the cornerstones of the economic 
reform. The development of many processes tracked by official 
statistics in 1992 and 1993, in particular in the areas of price 
setting and the incomes of the population, on the whole 
confirmed this hypothesis, which made it possible to voice 
suppositions about the broader extent of its applicability. 
  However, even calculations of the comparative index of 
conditions for banking operations broken down by economic 
regions, which level differences between individual territories 
to a considerable degree, at the very least fail to support this. 
  This is visible to the naked eye in the table given below. 
The use of the most basic statistical methods paints a more 
detailed picture: The standard deviation from the mean value of 
the index, which fell in the second quarter, grew in the first 
and especially the third quarters, and as of 1 October 
considerably exceeded the level at the beginning of the year. 
  At the same time, the attractiveness of conditions for 
banking operations declined steadily, quarter after quarter, in 
the Northern Region and (beginning with the second quarter) the 
Central-Chernozem Region. Moscow and the Urals Region, in which 
the comparative index exceeded the average Russian level, were 
the most attractive from the point of view of embarking on 
banking activities. Despite the overall downward trend, the 
growth of this index was registered in Moscow and the Far East 
during the first three quarters of 1993. 
  At the same time, the growth of differentiation in the 
conditions for banking operations in the various regions 
testifies to the emergence of both "financial centers" and 
hopeless and unpromising "financial boondocks" in Russia. The 
development is so uneven that the territories in question may be 
adjacent within the framework of the same economic region. 
  As far as the government is concerned, this, like any 
strengthening of disparities in the development of various 
regions, testifies to the need to make new efforts aimed at 
providing uniform conditions for economic operations and 
preserving the territorial integrity of Russia. 
  As far as the commercial banks are concerned, an increase in 
the disparity of the development of territories and regional 
differentiation in conditions for banking operations means that 
the need for preliminary estimates and for projecting such 
conditions will increase (at any rate in the foreseeable 
future), as will the "price of a mistake."

the more favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region 
under consideration is from the point of view of establishing branches. 

Note 2. The index of comparative conditions for banking operations as of 1 
October 1993 is different from that given in Table 1 because in Table 2 the 
results of calculations by simplified methods are given (since some of the 
statistical information for previous periods turned out to be inaccessible). 


<H3>  2.2. Quarterly Dynamics of the Assets of the Banking System 
of Russia in Real Terms by Economic Region </H3>
  Both enthusiasts who welcome the rapid development of the 
banking system of Russia and individuals who talk profusely 
about the excessive development of "speculative" capital or the 
need to reduce the money supply in real terms in order to 
restrict the growth of prices would benefit from learning about 
a reduction in the assets of commercial banks in real terms 
(adjusted for the level of inflation) in 1993. 
  As the table given below indicates, the reduction in 
question 
has proceeded in an extremely uneven manner in terms of both 
time and territories. In one-third of the economic regions of 
Russia--Northern, Northwestern, Volga, and North Caucasus--this 
reduction, which is indicative of the retrogression of the local 
banking system, is continuous and systematic in nature (which, 
however, in and of itself does not necessarily rule out the 
opportunity for the emergence of new financial centers in the 
territories of some of these regions). 
  It is notable that, paradoxical as it might be, a 
growth of assets in real terms was registered in 1993 
during periods of high rates of inflation. In the 
second quarter, when the growth of prices slowed down, 
assets in real terms fell by almost one-fourth. The 
dependence in question is an important illustration of the fact 
that with inflation at an average level, business activity (of 
which the value of assets in real terms is an indirect 
indication) grows with a higher level of prices and drops with a 
lower level. Therefore, moderate inflation acts, in a way, as a 
"booster" of business activity under the described conditions. 
  With this in view, it is possible to conjecture that a 
certain hardening of financial policy implemented in the fourth 
quarter of 1993 will bring about yet another reduction in assets 
in real terms. At the same time, an increase in the money supply 
after the New Year, which was virtually unavoidable because of 
the aggravation of the nonpayments problem and the growth of 
social tensions, will most likely cause not only an acceleration 
of the growth of prices but also a rise in business activity in 
the first quarter of 1994. According to available estimates, by 
1 April 1994 this rise may bring about a restoration of the 
level of assets in real terms as of the beginning or even end of 
the first quarter of 1993. 
  A comparison of data in the two provided tables shows that 
the growth of assets in real terms compared to the previous 
period, or the growth of the nominal assets of commercial bank 
outpacing inflation, is accompanied by the reinforcement of 
territorial differentiation in the conditions for banking 
operations. This is due to the fact that financial centers 
accumulate the bulk of the increment of monetary funds in real 
terms or, in other words, business activity grows primarily in 
financial centers that have considerably more developed 
production and, particularly important, financial infrastructure 
than other regions of the country.

<H3>  2.3. Quarterly Dynamics of Assets of the Banking System of 
Russia by Area </H3>
  The indicator of dynamics of bank assets broken down by 
economic region is only significant in forming a general 
picture. A high degree of generalization ensures the clarity 
which is necessary to this end, but also renders the use of this 
indicator to solve specific problems virtually meaningless. 
After all, each economic region includes territories with the 
most varied conditions for banking operations; as has been shown 
above, the development of market relations does not weaken but, 
on the contrary, strengthens existing differentiation (at any 
rate, at the present stage of development). 
  The dynamics of assets in real terms broken down by area are 
of practical significance in working out the policy of banks 
concerning branches. These dynamics complicate the perception of 
the overall picture but make it possible to track changes in the 
situation in each territory taken separately. 
  The assets of banks in real terms increased only in six 
areas 
out of the 77 observed, and in another eight areas the drop in 
assets was smaller than the average Russian level. Therefore, 
only in 14 areas out of 77 did conditions emerge which favored 
the development of the banking system. 
  From among the rest, we should note 40 areas in which a 
systematic fall in bank assets in real terms was registered 
quarter after quarter. The distribution of these stagnant 
territories among economic regions appears significant: 
  --in the Northern Region--four areas out of five (80 
percent); 
  --in the Northwestern Region--two areas out of five (40 
percent); 
  --in the Central Region--eight areas out of 13 (62 percent); 
  --in the Volga-Vyatka Region--three areas out of five (60 
percent); 
  --in the Central-Chernozem Region--two areas out of five (40 
percent); 
  --in the Volga Region--six areas out of eight (75 percent); 
  --in the Northern Caucasus Region--eight areas out of nine 
(89 percent); 
  --in the Urals Region--four areas out of seven (57 percent); 
  --in the West Siberian Region--two areas out of seven (29 
percent); 
  --in the East Siberian Region--one area out of six (17 
percent); 
  --and finally in the Far Eastern Region--not one (out of 
seven). 
  However, Voronezh Oblast, in which a genuine banking 
disaster 
occurred, stands out even against this background of depressed 
development. Assets in real terms, which grew by a factor of 1.5 
in the first quarter, dropped by a factor of more than five in 
the following half of the year. 
<H3>  2.4. Complementing the Comparative Index of Attractiveness 
of Conditions for Banking Operations With the Indicator of the 
Dynamics of Assets in Real Terms </H3>
  The dynamics of bank assets in real terms give us an idea of 
comparative conditions for the development of banking 
institutions in the territories under review; in this capacity, 
such dynamics may be taken into account in determining the 
attractiveness of these territories for embarking on banking 
operations in them. 
  The sharp quarterly fluctuations of bank assets in real 
terms 
which have been registered in many regions while the general 
development trend was pronounced prompt us to use periods of 
time longer than one quarter, looking to changes that occur over 
at least three quarters rather than one. 
  In the table below, the standard comparative index of 
attractiveness of conditions for banking operations is 
complemented with the index of changes in bank assets in real 
terms in the last three quarters. 
  The latter index introduces a dynamic component into the 
analysis and, as a comparison of results shows, virtually makes 
it possible to proceed in the course of analysis without 
calculating the comparative indexes of attractiveness of 
conditions for banking operations in the preceding periods 
(because the inertia of the rest of its components is rather 
high). 
  The index of changes in bank assets in real terms shows how 
strong and dynamic local banks are. As a rule, considerable 
reductions in assets in real terms testify to "outside" 
expansion which is strangling local banks; in this case, a bank 
penetrating the market will no longer have to compete with local 
banks but with more aggressive and compounded [as published] 
banks which are ahead of it. Only a very strong bank may try to 
capture their market. For a majority, entering the "domestic 
market" of local banks is within reach; even if the latter banks 
are strong enough to carry out their own branch programs, their 
attention is, as a rule, riveted to the regions of expansion and 
is weakened with regard to the territories of their location.

<H3>  III. Certain Prospects for Development of the Banking System 
of Russia </H3>
<H3>  1994 Promises to Become the Year of the "Great Repartition" 
of the Russian Market for Banking Services </H3>
  For now, it will be a repartition solely among Russian 
banks. 
  Extensive redistribution of clients among banks will 
apparently become the most conspicuous direction of the 
development of the banking sphere of Russia in 1994. A 
tremendous number of large enterprises are still serviced by 
cumbersome and comparatively inefficient structures such as 
Rosselkhozbank [Russian Agricultural Bank], Promstroybank 
[Industrial Construction Bank], as well as the banks of former 
sectoral ministries which are in an intermediate position. As a 
rule, settlements are slow at banks of this kind, fees for 
services are high, and the scope of services provided is narrow. 
However, the main point is that the "state-affiliated" banks 
have preserved the noncommercial style of operation and 
demonstrate no ability to change it. 
  Undoubtedly, as the market develops, inconveniences 
associated with this situation will become increasingly 
perceptible to clients, and will increasingly outweigh the sole 
advantage of the structures in question--easier access to state 
financing (including in the form of various preferential loans). 
This will cause a considerable number of enterprises possessing 
respectable financial resources to be "pushed" into the embrace 
of genuinely commercial banks in the immediate future, even if 
the banks are completely passive; this "push" is going to be 
protracted and massive. Neither the modernization of the 
present-day state-affiliated monsters nor the creation of their 
own banks by enterprises will be able to restrict this process 
in a major way. 
  For the purposes of a genuine conversion to commercial 
operations, the "state-affiliated" banks are too closely 
involved with the distribution of state resources. The issue of 
attracting clients is not a life or death issue for them; to a 
considerable degree, these banks (for example, Promstroybank) 
associate their prospects with hopeless attempts to restore the 
prereform past. 
  At present, the creation of new banks is increasingly 
difficult. A shortage of skilled personnel with integrity, 
mounting competition, and mainly the absence of guaranteed 
profits will make seeking the services of already successfully 
operating banks increasingly attractive compared to the creation 
of a proprietary bank. Let us recall that the banking "boom" of 
1992 and the first half of 1993 was due to a catastrophic 
decline of the ruble against the dollar, as a result of which it 
sufficed for a bank to acquire "self-growing" foreign exchange 
assets to secure stable high profits. In the second half of 1993 
the process of creation of banks was given a new impetus due to 
quite a number of mostly trading companies reaching a new stage 
of development. This impetus has virtually been depleted by now 
because the number and, most importantly, financial resources of 
large companies are already restricted by the market nearing 
saturation. 
  This is why there are grounds to believe that 1994 will be 
the last year of "explosive" growth in the number of banks. A 
"critical mass" will finally be reached in that year, and the 
further process of development in the banking system will most 
likely take the path of increasing the number of branches. 
Attacks on trust companies, which are beginning to usurp some 
banking functions, as well as the unsuccessful struggle of the 
Central Bank against small banks performing only an 
insignificant proportion of banking operations, may be viewed as 
early symptoms of the forthcoming sharp complication and 
internal stratification of the banking system of Russia. 
  As has been said above, such complexity and stratification 
will be accompanied by a mass repartition of the domestic market 
of banking services. The capture of clients by aggressive 
commercial banks from state-affiliated structures will be the 
main content of this process in 1994. However, it is estimated 
that the feast of Russian commercial "sharks" on the carcass of 
the sickly whale of the state banking system will not last 
long--no longer than 1.5 years. Later, foreign banks will break 
into the Russian market, which are now being contained by the 
absence of "threshold" stability rather than by state measures; 
Russian banks that do not manage to ensure support from large 
foreign structures, as Inkombank has, will experience major 
difficulties.

<F P=106> Article by the Management Board of the People's Bank: "We </F>
Suggest That Yu. M. Luzhkov, Moscow's Mayor, and V. V. 
Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Russian Federation's Central Bank, 
Investigate."] 
  [Text] Moscow's government has adopted a decision to 
transfer the servicing of the city's budget from the People's 
Bank to a group of so-called proxy banks. The question of which 
bank organizes the affairs of the moneyowner best is being 
solved. However, the trouble is that everything is not being 
done in a completely civilized manner. 
  The mass information media are conducting a purposeful 
campaign to discredit the People's Bank, which has serviced 
Moscow's budget for many years. We are officially stating that 
the accusations directed at us are false and are aimed at 
harming the bank's reputation and that we are prepared to prove 
our case with documents. 
  Our bank is competent enough not to fear for its reputation; 
however, the malicious nature of the libelous campaign compels 
us to give an explanation. The bank is not related to a single 
so-called delay of payment. Moreover, they are trying to accuse 
us of delaying wages to on-budget organizations that are, on the 
whole, not clients of the People's Bank. It is a pity that the 
mass information media are not finding time to check the 
reliability of their information. 
  We continuously receive letters from numerous clients who 
express gratitude for the long years of fruitful collaboration 
and who are puzzled about why they are being compelled to leave 
us against their wishes. 
  Our opinion regarding the transfer of budget assets to other 
banks is a simple one: If the government thinks that the other 
banks can service it better, it is advisable and we have no 
complaints. However, this does not mean that the People's Bank 
has serviced the city's budget poorly. On the contrary, it means 
that the People's Bank has serviced the budget normally. 
  If Moscow's government thinks that a group of other banks, 
called proxies, will do it better, it has a right to transfer 
the budget's management to them. In this case, however, all 
responsibility for the consequences rests with those who made 
this decision. 
  However, this normal approach to the matter evidently does 
not suit the authors of the campaign directed against us. They 
must prove that the People's Bank implemented the budget poorly 
and nothing remained for Moscow's government to do except to 
transfer the budget's servicing to others. In our view, the 
false and juggled information and facts about our bank's poor 
work begin here. 
  The procedure for transferring the budget also appears 
extremely strange. Everything was done in secret. They did not 
inform us about the criteria, which guided the government when 
selecting the proxy banks. Despite repeated promises, Moscow's 
mayor did not receive the chairman of the board of the People's 
Bank. Other leaders of the capital's government also did not 
wish to talk with us. 
  We do not want to praise ourselves but our achievements are 
well-known. For many years, we have not received any censures 
from our clients. We are ready to say and show that everything 
was done in the interests of the capital's inhabitants. We will 
do this with the help of the mass information media that has 
maintained its objectivity. 
  We are addressing an urgent request to Moscow's mayor and 
the 
chairman of Russia's Central Bank to investigate carefully what 
has happened, study the documents impartially and meet with the 
chairman of the board of the People's Bank. 
  We are requesting our customers, whom we have never refused 
to support and assist, to express their unbiased opinion about 
the work of the People's Bank. 
  We are turning to our banking colleagues: Today, a libelous 
campaign has been organized against us; tomorrow, it will be 
your turn if we do not give the necessary rebuff through our 
joint efforts to those forces, which are not disdaining any 
means to achieve their advantage.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tsukhlo, Institute of Transition Period </F>
Economic Problems: "Demand for Domestic Products Hits Record 
Low"] 
  [Text] The volume of production declined sharply in 
February. These are the results of a state of the market survey 
of 172 enterprise directors in Moscow and the oblast. While 
earlier only 50 percent of respondents mentioned production 
decline (December 1993), in February 61 percent mentioned it. 
The cause of the general decline in industry in February are 
reports of a substantial reduction in output at machine-building 
and construction material industry enterprises, where the 
balance of "increased"--"decreased" replies measured -60 percent 
and -53 percent, respectively. On the whole, a production 
increase was registered in February only at woodworking industry 
enterprises, where the balance is positive (+9 percent). 
  The absence of practical steps to implement the budget and 
credit policy of the new government has not changed the trend, 
which had materialized by the end of 1993, of the decline in 
producers' normal demand for industrial output. In February 
1994, 87 percent of enterprises saw demand for their products as 
insufficient (84 percent in January). The share assessing demand 
as normal dropped to a record low of all the surveys (8 
percent). Dissatisfaction with demand exceeded 90 percent in the 
machine-building, metallurgy, and petrochemical industries. In 
the woodworking industry even now at least 30 percent of 
enterprises see demand for their output as normal. In the summer 
of 1993 the share of such assessment in the sector was 50 
percent. 
  Low demand forces producers to first and foremost cut back 
on 
production: 47 percent of the respondents in this group are 
willing to cut back on production and only 11 percent are 
willing not to raise prices. Among enterprises that see the 
demand as normal, 22 percent will try to refrain from raising 
prices. 
  When the decline in production slowed down somewhat in 
January, in the environment of shrinking demand it caused a 
build-up of excess inventories of finished products. In February 
enterprises already preferred to cut production rather then fill 
their warehouses with finished products. The balance of 
inventory estimates dropped by five percentage points and 
returned to the level of November-December 1993. Nevertheless, 
an increase in excess inventories was registered at enterprises 
in machine-building (62 percent, in January--55 percent), 
woodworking (55 percent, in January--0 percent), and food 
processing (50 percent, in January--38 percent) industries. 
  The survey results show that enterprises forecast changes in 
their production practically without taking into account the 
volume of inventories of finished products. However, inventory 
estimates do influence producers' price policy--16 percent of 
enterprises with excess inventories will attempt to hold prices 
at the same level, and only 10 percent of those with normal 
inventories will attempt to do so. 
  In February the number of surveyed enterprises expecting 
production decline was no longer increasing. The differential of 
"will increase"--"will decline" answers measured -31 percent 
(-33 percent in January). At the same time, only 36 percent of 
enterprises hoped to maintain production volume. This is the 
worst level in the past 17 months. The highest expectations of 
production cutbacks are steadily registered at very large (54 
percent replied "will decline") and large (45 percent) 
production facilities. During the next few months production 
cutbacks are most likely in machine-building (balance -42 
percent), light industry (-22 percent), and the petrochemical 
industry (-28 percent). At woodworking and food processing 
industry enterprises the prevailing forecast for the new year is 
one of maintaining the current production volume. 
  After the January jump in inflationary expectations, hopes 
for curbing the price race rose again in February: The share of 
"will not change" replies comprised 10 percent (5 percent in 
January and 15 percent in December). Mainly, efforts to keep 
wholesale prices at the same level will be made in light (21 
percent of "will not change" and 5 percent of "will fall" 
replies), machine-building (12 percent "will not change"), and 
woodworking (9 percent "will not change") industries.

goods and services rose by 1.9 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--by 1.6 percent, nonfood items--by 2.4 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--by 1.7 percent. Consumer 
prices for goods and services rose in practically all regions of 
Russia by 1-2.5 percent. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in 
February

  In organized trade over the past week the pace of 
price increases slowed down with respect to practically all 
monitored foodstuffs. At the same time, prices with respect to 
milk products, cereals and macaroni items, vegetables, and fish 
products continued to rise at an anticipatory rate. There was 
practically no change in prices for sugar, vodka, vegetable oil, 
tea, flour, and oranges. 
  Since the beginning of February prices for milk products 
have 
risen by 17.6 percent; for cereals and macaroni items, potatoes, 
and vegetables--by 13 percent; for bread and bakery items--by 10 
percent; and for meat and meat products--by 7.7 percent. 
  In nonorganized trade, prices rose over this week 
on average at a somewhat slower rate than in organized trade (1 
percent). Vegetable prices rose at a higher rate. Those for 
fresh cabbage increased by 8 percent. Since the beginning of the 
month vegetable prices have risen by more than 20 percent. 
  The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs rose over the week by 1.6 percent and amounted 
as of 22 February to 40,800 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. Magadan remains the most expensive city (R97,500) and 
Ulyanovsk--the least expensive (R23,800). Moscow is in 30th 
place of 132 monitored cities (R45,300 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Over the past week prices for the main categories of nonfood 
items rose by 1-3 percent. A higher rate of price increases was 
registered with respect to synthetic detergents and certain 
categories of medical supplies (5-10 percent). 
  Since the beginning of February prices for fabrics, cultural 
and household items, and certain categories of medical supplies 
have increased by 10-20 percent. 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  Fees for services changed insignificantly over the past week 
(1.7 percent). Since the beginning of February the cost of 
municipal housing has increased 1.8-fold, hot water 
fees--1.6-fold, and the cost of basic residential telephone 
service--by almost 30 percent. Suburban train and intercity bus 
fares increased by 20 percent. 
<H3>  Production of the Most Important Varieties of Industrial 
Output </H3>
  Over 20 days of February 1994, of 163 categories of products 
counted in periodic reports, average daily production as 
compared to the corresponding period of February 1993: 
  --increased with respect to 11 items, (including 
polypropylene, polyvinylchloride plastics, cotton fabrics, tea, 
toothpaste), or 7 percent of the total number; 
  --Decreased with respect to 149 positions, or 91 
percent of the total number; 
  and as compared to the corresponding period of January 1994: 
  --increased with respect to 101 items, (including 
coal, iron ore, steel pipe, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizers, 
caustic soda, synthetic dyes, polyvinylchloride tar and 
vinylchloride copolymers, chemical fibers and filaments, large 
electric machinery, metal-cutting machine tools, self-propelled 
cranes, rail freight cars, trolleybuses, friction-free ball 
bearings, wood-chip board, cardboard, cement, construction 
brick, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe and couplers, soft 
roofing and insulation materials, refrigerators and freezers, 
washers, tape recorders, radio receivers, television sets, 
sewing machines, fabrics, knitwear and hosiery, footwear, 
butter, high-fat cheese and feta cheese, whole-milk products, 
bread and bakery items, facial soap), or 62 percent of the total 
number; 
  --decreased with respect to 59 items, or 36 
percent of the total number. 
  Based on the dynamics of the output of most important 
categories of products, the estimated average daily volume of 
industrial production over the elapsed period of February 1994 
amounted to 74 percent of the level of the corresponding period 
of last year's February. 
  The output of main categories of industrial products over 20 
days of February 1994 is characterized by the following data: 


                           Produced over     as % of the corresponding period

<H5>  Rail Transport </H5>
  As of 1 February 1994, 44.4 million tonnes of goods due to 
be 
transported by rail were waiting at enterprises and railroad 
stations, including 36.4 million tonnes at track-adjacent 
loading areas of enterprises and stations, which is 0.8 percent 
more than as of 1 February 1993 and 17 percent less than as of 1 
January 1994. 
  The most significant among unshipped cargo remainders were 
the following:

of bituminous coal awaiting shipping in Russia, Rostov 
Oblast--for 18 percent, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)--8 
percent, and the Republic of Komi--7 percent; 12 percent of the 
timber is awaiting shipping in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 9 percent--in 
Irkutsk Oblast, 8 percent each in Kostroma and Tyumen Oblasts 
and the Republic of Komi; with respect to construction cargo 
remainders, Novosibirsk Oblast accounts for 26 percent,

oil and petroleum products: Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--20 percent, 
Omsk Oblast--18 percent, and Perm Oblast--15 percent. 
<H5>  Privatization in Industry </H5>
  In 1993, 12,000 state and municipal industrial enterprises 
were privatized in Russia. At 3,800 enterprises the 
privatization process has been completed and all payments have 
been made in full (including at 1,900 light industry 
enterprises). 
  The denationalization process has spread to all industrial 
sectors. It is practically complete in light industry (98.6 
percent of the total number of state and municipal enterprises 
in the sector had been privatized as of the beginning of the 
year); the process is actively progressing in ferrous metallurgy 
(54.6 percent), the chemical and petrochemical industry (52.9 
percent), and machine building and metalworking (51.0 percent). 
  At the same time, in the construction material and food 
processing industries, whose enterprises are subject to 
mandatory privatization, denationalization is proceeding at a 
relatively slow pace: 35-43 percent of enterprises have been 
privatized. 
  Data on privatization of state and municipal enterprises by 
industry sector in 1993 are shown below:

  Denationalization in Russian industry in 1993 was 
accomplished mostly through conversion to joint-stock holding. 
This was the preferred method chosen by 6,223 state and 
municipal enterprises, or 52 percent of those privatized (in 
1992--19 percent of enterprises). Under this method, enterprise 
employees select, as a rule, the second option for preferences, 
whereby common stock, which comprises 51 percent of the charter 
capital, is to be sold to enterprise employees, as well as 
employees of enterprises that are linked with it in a single 
technological complex (in 1993, 47 percent of shares were sold 
to employees of privatized enterprises). 
  This method of privatization was used most in 1993 in 
machine-building and metalworking, where 1,870 joint-stock 
companies were set up; in the food processing industry--1,732; 
and the construction materials industry--500. 
  In 1993 more than 577 million shares of stock were issued 
and 
sold, with a nominal value of R1,000 per share on average, for a 
total amount of R416 billion. About 53 percent of all stock 
issued, in the amount of R187 billion, was transferred to the 
property fund (of them, 72 million shares were sold by the fund 
through auctions, 2.4 million shares--through bids, and 7.5 
million shares--at investment auctions). After selling stock at 
auctions, through bids, and through investment auctions, as of 1 
January 1994, 215.5 million shares worth R154.8 billion were 
left in the fund. 
  About 23 percent of all shares were purchased by enterprise 
employees at the selling price set by the State Committee for 
the Administration of State Property, in the amount of R144 
billion. Also purchased were 77.5 million shares of Class A 
preferred stock (13.4 percent) in the amount of R46.8 billion. 
Forty-five million shares of common stock worth R27.3 billion 
were distributed on preferential terms among enterprise 
employees. 
  The Russian economy received R118.5 billion from 
privatization of industrial enterprises, including R15.7 billion 
from fully privatized enterprises. 
<H5>  Account-Clearing Relations with CIS and Baltic Countries </H5>
  By the beginning of 1994 the accounts payable debt at 
enterprises in industry, construction, transportation, and 
agriculture amounted to R47.0 trillion, including R16.4 
trillion, or 35 percent, in past due accounts; enterprise 
accounts receivable amounted to R43.8 trillion, including R18.1 
trillion, or 41 percent, in past due accounts. 
  Russian Federation enterprises accounted for the greatest 
share of past due accounts--R16.0 trillion, or 98 percent; and 
CIS and Baltic countries through direct contracts--for R0.3 
trillion, or 1.5 percent. 
  Enterprise accounts receivable in transactions between 
Russian Federation enterprises amounted to R16.5 trillion, or 91 
percent of the total amount. Past due accounts of enterprises 
located on the territory of CIS and Baltic countries in direct 
contracts with Russian enterprises amounted to R0.6 trillion, or 
3.4 percent. 
  The status of account-clearing relations of enterprises and 
organizations in Russian industry, construction, transportation, 
and agriculture in direct contracts with enterprises located on 
the territory of CIS and Baltic countries was characterized by 
the following data (billions of rubles):

<H5>  Employment in Northern Regions </H5>
  The situation in the labor market in the northern regions is 
developing unevenly. While in Tyumen and Kamchatka Oblasts and 
the Republics of Komi and Sakha (Yakutia) the unemployed 
population figures per vacancy listed with the employment 
service are about the same as the average for Russia, in the 
Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Sakhalin Oblasts it 
reaches 12-24 persons. 
  Statistics organs conducted a simultaneous survey of 500 
enterprises and organizations in industry, construction, 
transportation, and health care, located in the northern regions 
of the country. The respondents were managers and employees of 
these enterprises' personnel department. 
  Over the past 1.5 years the total labor force at surveyed 
enterprises and organizations shrunk on the whole by 9 percent. 
The number of employees who have moved here from other 
territories fell by 18 percent as compared to 6 percent among 
other workers; in construction--by 26 percent and 16 percent, 
respectively. The proportional share of contract workers who 
came to the northern regions on a fixed-term special northern 
region contract in the total labor force fell over this period 
at surveyed enterprises from 22 percent to 20 percent, and in 
construction organizations--from 24 percent to 22 percent. 
  Below are data on changes in the number of workers under 
fixed-term special northern region contract in relation to the 
total labor force at surveyed enterprises, by individual region.

  At surveyed enterprises in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Khabarovsk 
and 
Krasnoyarsk Kray, and the Republic of Buryatia, workers 
attracted from other territories comprise between 2 and 7 
percent. 
  Among workers under fixed-term special northern region labor 
contract, 71 percent came from other regions of Russia, and 29 
percent--from former USSR republics. Among the guest workers, 21 
percent are under 30, and 12 percent are over 50. 
  One out of every two surveyed workers has worked in the 
northern regions for more than 10 years, and 13 percent--for 
more than 20 years. 
  According to the estimates of personnel department managers, 
about half of surveyed enterprises and organizations are 
experiencing a labor shortage. This problem is most acute in 
Murmansk Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), where between 55 and 63 percent of enterprises are 
short of skilled workers. A shortage of specialists was noted by 
26 percent of managers of industrial enterprises, 21 percent of 
construction organizations, and 55 percent of health care 
institutions. In addition, the situation is substantially 
exacerbated by a mismatch in professions and skills on the 
demand and supply sides of the labor force. 
  In the opinion of personnel service managers, in 1994 the 
labor shortage will be exacerbated at one out of five 
enterprises, and at one out of six a shortage may arise. In 
Buryatia, Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and Magadan Oblasts and the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), 45-53 percent of surveyed managers 
expect this situation. 
  At the same time, 31 percent of surveyed enterprises are not 
experiencing labor shortages, and 17 percent of surveyed 
managers indicated a potential labor force surplus. This will 
affect to a greater extent enterprises on the territory of the 
Komi Republic and Krasnoyarsk Kray (28-35 percent). 
  In Tyumen Oblast one-third of personnel department managers 
assume that labor force requirements at their enterprises will 
decrease. 
  The prospects of enterprises in northern regions with 
respect 
to labor force supply depend to a great extent on the intentions 
of individual workers currently working at enterprises regarding 
future work in the northern regions. To determine these 
intentions, a survey of 5,400 guest workers from other regions 
was conducted. More than one-half of respondents (53 percent) 
indicated that they intend to leave their current place of 
residence and employment; two-thirds of them do not have housing 
in the area they intend to move to. 
  Of those workers who intend to leave the northern regions, 
73 
percent are persons with higher and secondary vocational 
education. One out of three is between 30 and 40 years old. 
  Among the respondents who intend to leave the northern 
regions, 3 percent indicated that their labor contract for work 
in the northern regions is about to expire; the rest name other 
reasons prompting them to move. 
  One out of four respondents indicated dissatisfaction with 
the pay level as one of their main reasons for leaving. 
  The survey results showed that the system of preferences and 
allowances for people living and working in the northern regions 
has lost its determinant role in attracting labor resources to 
work in harsh natural and climatic conditions. Despite the 
higher nominal wages of workers in the northern regions, the 
pay's purchasing capacity does not provide substantial 
advantages as compared to other territories in Russia. For 
instance, the average monthly wage in Arkhangelsk, Kamchatka, 
Magadan, and Sakhalin Oblasts and the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia) recalculated as the cost of a comparable consumer food 
basket is on the same level as central and southern regions of 
Russia. 
  Among the reasons for leaving, 13 percent of workers named 
poor food and consumer products supply. This problem is most 
acute in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Tyumen and Irkutsk 
Oblasts. 
  A large group is comprised of workers who intend to leave 
the 
northern regions because of dissatisfaction with housing 
conditions. This reason was named by 10 percent of respondents, 
and in the Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Amur 
Oblasts--by more than 15 percent. 
  Ecological factors have a substantial influence on workers' 
migration mobility. The poor state of the environment was named 
as one of the main reasons for leaving by 24 percent of workers 
in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 19 percent in Irkutsk Oblast, 15 percent 
in Murmansk Oblast, and 11 percent in Khabarovsk Kray and Tyumen 
Oblast. 
  In addition to the aforementioned main reasons prompting 
people to leave northern regions, the respondents indicated that 
they had to leave because of poor health, dissatisfaction with 
social and household services, difficulties in providing summer 
recreation for children, and access to school and other 
education for children. 
  Many of those returning to near abroad countries before 
their 
labor contract expires are not certain that their housing, 
reserved for them for the period of absence, is still there, or 
that the preferential length of service record earned in Russia 
will be taken into account in qualifying for retirement. 
  To the question regarding on what terms the respondents 
would 
agree to continue work in the northern regions, 9 percent 
replied that they would not stay under any circumstances. In the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Khabarovsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, and 
Tyumen Oblast the proportion of such workers was 14-16 percent. 
If material incentives are improved, 25 percent of workers and 
professionals among those who intend to leave would stay. Among 
managers, the share of those who would stay on condition of 
better pay is lower than among specialists and workers. In 
health care, 28 percent will reverse their decision to leave if 
their pay is increased.

<F P=106> [Analysis made by the Center of Economic Market Conditions </F>
under the Russian Federation government: "February: The Month's 
Prices--My Dear Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and Others"; plus 
report on foreign prices with selections made by Lyubov Volkova] 
  [Text] The results for February have been summarized. 
Judging from the operational data of daily monitoring of prices 
by state statistical organs, the past month was not as bleak as 
January. The inflation rate was substantially lower. If you 
remember, at that time the level of inflation was 22 percent, 
growing by 6-7 percent a week at times. But during the first two 
weeks in February, the inflation index was 4 percent, and in the 
second half of the month--no more than 2 percent. 
  The general inflation index was 109.9 percent, and since the 
start of the year--134.1 percent. 
  The prices of paid services rose most markedly for us. Their 
rates rose substantially faster than prices for food and 
industrial goods. This did not occur suddenly and according to 
predictions will not end soon. This February the prices for paid 
personal services rose by 14.3 percent, while they rose by 9.4 
percent for food items and by 10 percent for industrial goods. 
  In the list of cities of Russia being studied, Moscow went 
from 35th to 33rd place in terms of higher prices. Here the cost 
of the group of the 19 most important food items rose by 4,388 
rubles [R] and now totals R45,400. In St. Petersburg the group 
now costs R42,600, which was 13.3 percent higher than in January.

  Inflation was lower but more base, more vile perhaps. The 
simplest food items rose in price at a fast rate this time; 
these are the items our old folks, children, and low-income 
persons live on. During the month the price of vegetables rose 
sharply--by 22 percent; of dairy products--by 19 percent; and of 
groats and macaroni products--by 16 percent. The price of fish 
products and animal fat rose by 13 percent. 
  During the month the prices of the following items rose 
least 
of all: fruit--by 4.1 percent; vegetable oil--by 3.6 percent; 
and sugar--by 1.1 percent. Vodka got 1.4 percent cheaper. 
  In both stores and at markets prices mostly rose for the 
very 
same goods, which attests to the objectivity of the processes. 
But the rise in prices for vegetables at markets was higher and 
totaled 25 percent. But then prices for fish, milk, and eggs 
rose substantially less at markets. 
  In all, prices for foodstuffs have risen as follows since 
the 
start of the year: for dairy products--by a factor of 1.6; for 
vegetables--by a factor of 1.5; and for baked goods, animal fat, 
and salt--by a factor of 1.4. 
  The average cost for the group of 19 for Russia as a whole 
on 
28 February was R41,300. But there are substantial differences. 
For prices of organized trade, the figure is R39,800, but for 
market prices it is R54,100 [unclear]. 
  There has always been only one answer to the eternal 
question, "Where is it best to live": "Somewhere else." But even 
so... 
  Look at the map of Russia. It is divided into parts and 
colored in different tones. Darker--inflation is higher than the 
average Russian level, the brightest part--inflation is lower 
than the average Russian level. The average between them is the 
average Russian level plus or minus 1 percent. The gap between 
the maximum and minimum cost of the group in various cities of 
the country is a factor of 3.4. The Volga Region is one of the 
"cheapest" regions, but within it there are differences in 
prices. Thus, in Ulyanovsk the group of 19 items costs R24,100, 
while next door, in Tolyatti--R54,400. The most expensive cities 
in terms of the cost of the group of most important foodstuffs 
remain the cities of the Far East region, Magadan (R97,000), 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (R83,800), and Vladivostok (R83,300).

<H5>  Where Should You Go for a Suit? </H5>
  The city of Rubtsovsk, of course. There in January a man's 
suit (two-piece) cost ten thirty-ninths the price in Vorkuta. 
And by the end of February the gap had increased even more and 
now equals ten forty-ninths the price. Barely one-fifth. 
  For Russia overall, prices for nonfood goods rose by 10 
percent. Last month the price of fuel rose the most--by 55 
percent, of medicine--by 23 percent, of synthetic laundry 
detergent--by 22 percent, and of wallpaper--by 20 percent. 
Prices for shoes and tobacco products changed the least--by 7 
percent. 
  That is the analysis of the month's prices made by the 
Center 
of Economic Market Conditions under the Russian Federation 
government. 
<H5>  What Things Cost Abroad </H5>
<H6>  Germany </H6>
  Bread is expensive in Germany. One kilogram costs roughly 
2.5 
marks, which in our money equals about R2,000. But if you 
compare it with earnings, bread costs Germans less than it does 
us. 
  Did the price of bread rise after reunification? Yes, many 
times over, roughly 8-fold. And right after the reunification of 
Germany, on 1 July 1990. Common money was introduced and right 
away free prices. The next day, one might say. 
  Did the prices of other goods rise to the same degree? No, 
the price of bread rose most of all. Because in the GDR bread 
used to be almost free, the government subsidized the baking of 
it. 
  Prices for domestic goods are like this. One can buy a 
television for 500 marks. That is 3 days work for an average 
paid specialist. The televisions, it is true, are from Taiwan, 
and small and their service life is 3-4 years. But their quality 
is pretty good. There are, of course, televisions for 10,000 
marks too. That is two and one-half months work for a 
specialist. Different sums, different quality. The difference is 
20-fold. In our country practically all televisions are from 
Taiwan or similar countries. But their cost is not 3 days work 
for a specialist but 2-3 months work. And only if the specialist 
has a pretty good job. The average wage of a specialist in the 
former East Germany is 3,100 marks. That is 75 percent of the 
West's. 
<H6>  Inflation </H6>
  In Finland 1 loaf of white bread costs approximately 8 marks 
and sugar costs just as much. Butter costs an average of 34 
marks for a kilogram. Milk is 4-5 marks. Fresh meat, not frozen, 
is about 80 marks, the worst, about 40 marks. Half a kilogram of 
granulated coffee costs 10-12 marks. 
  Convert prices to the mark's rate and you will be convinced 
that the absolute price levels have not been reached yet. 
  Our earnings are a different matter. They are not yet 
comparable.

  The innovative activity of Russian industrial enterprises on 
the basis of the results of 1993, both as compared with their 
activity in 1990-1992 and with their own expectations expressed 
at the beginning of 1993, was obviously stirred up (two previous 
innovative tests were performed by the "Russian Economic 
Barometer" in November 1992 and in February 1993). Almost 
one-half of the respondents, which at the beginning of 1993 did 
not intend to carry out innovations, by the end of the year 
changed their intentions. At the same time, out of those that at 
the beginning of 1993 intended to carry out innovations only 
one-twelfth of the respondents abandoned their plans. On the 
average, the increase in the innovative quota (that is, the 
innovators' share in the total number of surveyed enterprises), 
as compared with 1990-1992, made up 9 percent points and, as 
compared with the expectations for 1993, 16 percent points. The 
shift occurred mainly owing to the activation of enterprises of 
sector III and, in part, of enterprises of sector I. At the same 
time, the innovative activity of sector II remained at the 
previous level. As the experience of other countries conducting 
innovative surveys (for example, East Germany) shows, a sharp 
increase in innovative activity is a characteristic sign of a 
transitional economy. Although in our case (Russia) further 
research is still needed to confirm the correctness of such a 
conclusion. 
  The distribution of innovations carried out in 1992-1993 
into 
two main types--PRODUCT-INNOVATIONS (innovations or significant 
improvements in produced products) and PROCESS-INNOVATIONS 
(innovations or significant improvements in production 
processes)--on the basis of the results of the fall survey looks 
as follows:

  As compared with the two previous surveys, a marked shift 
toward product-innovations can be noted in sector I of the 
manufacturing industry and, to a lesser degree, in sector III. 
In sector II the ratio of the two types of innovations did not 
change. On the whole, an intensified introduction of innovations 
or improvements in products of sectors producing consumer and 
intermediate goods was the basic motive force in the stirring up 
of the innovative activity of the Russian industry in 1993. 
  The hierarchy of goals pursued during the implementation of 
various types of innovations looks as follows:

environment 



*Respondents could indicate all the goals important from their point of view. 


  According to these parameters of innovative activity, 
Russian 
industrial enterprises have demonstrated quite a marked 
unanimity. Both in industry as a whole and in individual sectors 
enterprises carry out product-innovations primarily in order to 
change over to the output of new products, remaining within 
their basic sector. The output of substitutes for previously 
produced goods is second in importance and the output of 
products exceeding the scope of the basic sector, that is, 
diversification, is third. The diversification rating in sector 
II, which is higher as compared with other sectors, is 
noteworthy. Probably, this is connected with the development of 
the conversion of machine building defense enterprises. 
  The introduction of labor-, materials-, and energy-saving 
technologies is the main priority during the implementation of 
process-innovations for the entire industry and for its 
individual sectors. An increase in production flexibility is in 
the second place, an improvement in working conditions, in the 
third place, and a reduction in the load on the environment, in 
the last place. 
  If the comparison of Russia and Germany in the hierarchy of 
goals in the implementation of innovations is continued, it can 
be noted that in the goals of product-innovations there is an 
approximate correspondence among them, whereas in 
process-innovations there is a marked difference. In Germany 
(both in western and in eastern lands) an increase in production 
flexibility, not a reduction in costs, is the most important 
goal. In Russia, however, this trend is only in the second place. 
  What causes such a difference? In our opinion, the fact that 
the Russian industry is characterized by serious technological 
backwardness, primarily in sectors producing consumer goods. As 
a result, the labor-, materials-, and power-intensiveness of 
production is much higher here than in developed countries. As 
domestic prices of raw and basic materials and energy carriers 
approach world prices, the noncompetitiveness of Russian goods 
is manifested ever more sharply. Increasing the "degree of 
contemporaneity" of applied technologies and bringing them up to 
the level already existing in developed countries are the most 
urgent problems in this situation. Thus, Russian enterprises 
primarily see to it that the opportunities provided for modern 
technologies for the economy of the scale in the mass production 
of standard products be utilized fully. For companies in 
countries with a developed market economy all this is an already 
traversed stage. An increase in efficiency through the diversity 
of products and selection of the optimum variation of the scale 
in the small-series production of differentiated products is the 
main imperative here. That is why they see the basic goal of 
their process-innovations in the introduction of flexible module 
technologies capable of a quick reorientation toward meeting the 
demand placed by the present-day, highly segmented market. 
  The structure of output from the standpoint of the "life 
cycle" of goods, that is, proportions among products in various 
phases of this cycle (entry into the market, growth, stagnation, 
and reduction), is an important characteristic of the efficiency 
of innovations.

  In order to ensure a long-term survival on the market, 
enterprises must form the structure of their products so that 
they can reach two main goals. 
  First, to promptly replace obsolete goods, which must be 
modified or removed from production in the very near future. 
From this point of view the difference between the shares of 
output in phases I and IV is important. This difference should 
be positive--the bigger it is, the better. 
  Second, it is necessary to ensure a stable income for the 
financing of the activity of an enterprise as a whole and of 
innovative activity in particular. From this point of view the 
sum of shares of output in phases II and III, that is, output 
which has already gained recognition on the market, is 
important. As the experience of German companies shows, the 
share of such output should be no less than two-thirds. 
  In most Russian enterprises the first indicator (the balance 
between phases I and IV) is at a minimally favorable level. It 
makes up +1 percent point in the entire industry and the 
manufacturing industry, +9 percent points in sector I, and +8 
percent points in sector II. Sector III, where the balance is 
very unfavorable, that is, -25 percent points, constitutes an 
exception. 
  The second indicator is at an acceptable level only in 
sector 
II (60 percent). In the other sectors (53 percent in I and 37 
percent in III) and throughout the industry (51 percent) it is 
too low. This means that in the current transitional situation 
in Russian enterprises the share of the least promising, 
obsolete goods (in phase IV--the reduction phase) is dangerously 
high and they are forced to maintain, as a minimum, such a high 
share of goods in phase I (entry into the market). Goods 
entering the market can be the most promising. At the same time, 
however, their production is connected with the greatest risk 
(since their profitability has not been demonstrated 
definitively) and with considerable capital investments in 
production and the marketing system. 
  The length of the "cycle of birth" of product-innovations, 
that is, of the period elapsing from the appearance of the idea 
of the output of a new or improved product until the beginning 
of its series output, is another important indicator 
characterizing the intensity of innovative activity in industry.

(months) 


  According to survey data, the "cycle of birth" in the 
Russian 
industry is quite short--from 13 months in sectors producing 
consumer goods to 26 months in sectors producing investment 
goods. By comparison, in Germany's western lands, on the 
average, in the manufacturing industry it is 27 months (similar 
data on Germany's eastern lands are not available). 
  Such high efficiency of Russian enterprises in bringing new 
or improved products to the market can be attributed to the fact 
that in the current situation in their innovative activity they 
adhere primarily to an imitative, overtaking strategy, 
introducing goods that have already attained success on the 
world market. Such goods represent innovations for Russia alone 
and demand from enterprises mainly expenditures on experimental 
and design research and development. However, in developed 
countries an attacking, offensive strategy is the predominant 
direction in the innovative activity of industrial companies. It 
requires substantial expenditures on scientific research--on 
applied, as well as basic, research. For example, almost 
one-half of the innovations carried out by West German companies 
involve patent registration. There are no similar data on the 
degree of the patent protection of product-innovations in 
Russian enterprises. However, data on the degree of 
participation of professional scientific research organizations 
in innovations carried out by enterprises can serve as an 
indirect confirmation of the weak radical nature of innovations.

  The virtually complete confinement of Russian enterprises to 
their own research and development is due not only to the acute 
shortage of financial resources (about which most respondents 
complain). Russia's industry faces the need, primarily, "to 
digest" what is already known: To bring the parameters and 
design of its products closer to the standards of developed 
countries, to master goods elementary for the Western market, 
but absent on the Russian market, and to reorient the production 
of traditional goods to new raw and basic materials (this 
concerns especially products of the consumer sector). During 
this period the decline in the interest of enterprises in 
radical, offensive innovations is quite natural. It is only a 
pity that the collapse of Russian science can come before 
enterprises make the demand for basic and applied scientific 
research. This circumstance should be created by state bodies. 
Weaknesses have the habit of accumulating more rapidly than 
advantages. Therefore, shortcomings of the imitative strategy 
can have a serious effect on the future competitiveness of the 
Russian industry. 
  The shortage of financial resources, which holds back the 
implementation of innovations, is aggravated by the emerging 
distancing of Russian banks from industry (distancing, we will 
note, also quite natural under conditions of our inflationary 
transitional economy). This is expressed in the fact that 
commercial banks primarily credit intermediate trade, not 
industrial, enterprises and are extremely reluctant to give 
long-term credit for industrial investment projects, in 
particular those connected with innovations.

The sum of numbers in individual columns in lines 1.1 and 1.2 is bigger 
than that of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 1 and the sum 
of numbers in individual columns in lines 2.1 and 2.2 is bigger than that 
of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 2, since some enterprises 
noted the receipt or nonreceipt of both types of credit. 


  As can be seen from Table 8, during the solution of the 
problem concerning the financing of innovations almost one-half 
of Russian enterprises did not even try to receive a bank loan 
and out of those that applied for bank services only a little 
more than one-fourth attained success. Naturally, the demand for 
goal-oriented state credits--at favorable rates--was higher than 
for commercial credits at market interest rates. Accordingly, 
enterprises, usually, were denied the first type of credit--the 
ratio between those that received and did not receive a loan 
among those that applied for state credit averaged 1:4 (from 
1:11 in sector I to 1:1.5 in sector II) and among those that 
applied for commercial credit, 1:2 (from 1:3 in sector I to 1:1 
in sector II). Enterprises of sectors producing investment goods 
were the main recipients of innovation credits (they accounted 
for more than one-half of those that received loans of both 
types), while enterprises of sectors producing intermediate and 
consumer goods in the process of the financing of innovations 
were "displaced" to a considerable extent from the credit 
market, which is narrow as it is, and were forced to rely mainly 
on themselves.

"Our Debts Are Heavy: Wages Have Been Cut, but This Is Not the 
Problem"] 
  [Text] After the explosive increase in average wages in 
Russia in December of last year (from 101,000 rubles [R] to 
R141,000), in January, they not only did not rise further, as 
expected, but, on the contrary, they were cut by R7,000. A 
similar scene also occurred in January of last year. The 
reasons, on the whole, are understandable. Each December, 
enterprises and organizations try, by hook or by crook, to make 
maximum payments to their own workers (every possible kind of 
bonus for the quarter and for the year, material assistance, 
wages for a thirteenth month and so on), in order to compensate 
somewhat for having wages lag behind price increases over the 
course of the year. And so, in January, there is no longer any 
money. 
  But, even taking into account the small January "recoil," 
all 
the same, the increase in wages over the 2 months (December and 
January), on the whole, corresponded to the rate of price 
increases over this same period. That is, wages rose to the same 
extent as prices. So that there would have been nothing unusual 
in this temporary January decrease, if all the credited money 
had gone to those for whom it was intended. However, the main 
problem is the fact that, at many enterprises, people are not 
receiving their wages at all for 1, 2 or even 3 months or are 
receiving only part of them. Under these conditions, although 
the wages credited on paper and recorded by the statistics make 
it possible to make a judgment about trends, they do not give an 
accurate idea about actual payments. 
  But in general, in and of themselves, wages still do not 
give 
a clear idea about the standard of living, because it is 
necessary to take not only them, but all monetary incomes 
calculated on a per capita basis and to correlate them with 
prices. So, if a judgment is to be made based on the level of 
actual incomes (adjusted based on the consumer price index), 
then, in 12 territories, life over the past year on the whole 
has deteriorated noticeably. Here, the actual January incomes in 
1994 amounted to less than 70 percent of the incomes in January 
of 1993. These are the republics of Karachayevo-Cherkessia and 
Tuva, Stavropol Kray and Kursk, Samara, Novosibirsk, Omsk, 
Tomsk, Tyumen, Chita, Kamchatka and Magadan oblasts. 
  But where, all the same, have actual incomes increased? They 
are supposed to increase by 10-20 percent (if all debts are 
paid) in Karelia, Khakasia, Pskov Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Tver 
Oblast and a number of other oblasts. The increase is supposed 
to be even larger in Kabardino-Balkaria, St. Petersburg, Moscow 
and Leningrad and Moscow oblasts. 
<H5>  Millionaires and Beggars </H5>
  The statistical data testify to the fact that the 
stratification into the rich and the poor is continuing. It has 
already been reported that the monetary incomes of the 10 
percent of the most well-off Russian citizens are higher than 
the incomes of the 10 percent of the least well-off citizens by 
a factor of 11. In point of fact, the disparity is apparently 
much greater, because our millionaires and billionaires do not 
advertise the lion's share of their incomes and these funds 
"escape" the attention of the statisticians. On the other hand, 
among the indigent, there are, for example, no bums or beggars. 
So the disparity in incomes between the rich and the poor 
possibly amounts to factors of 30, 35 or even 40. Incidentally, 
the officially recorded disparity in the wages of the 10 percent 
of the rich and the poor has already exceeded a factor of 27. 
  However, we can currently also report new indicators which 
characterize the stratification in Russian society. In January 
of 1994, 20 percent of the very well-off section of the populace 
had almost half (42 percent) of all the monetary incomes in the 
country, while 20 percent of the poor had only 7 percent of the 
incomes. The so-called Dzhin factor gives an even clearer 
picture. It shows how the concentration of incomes among the 
populace is proceeding. If all the people's incomes were equal, 
then the Dzhin factor would be equal to zero. But, on the other 
hand, if all the incomes turned out to be (theoretically) in the 
hands of a single superbillionaire, then the factor would be 1. 
Now let us see how this indicator changed in Russia. At the 
end of 1991, the Dzhin factor amounted to 0.256, to 0.327 at the 
end of 1992, to 0.346 at the end of 1993 and to 0.352 in January 
of 1994. That is, the factor is shifting from zero to one. It is 
clear even to a non-specialist that the stratification in 
society is not only continuing, but is even proceeding faster 
and faster. 
  And the disparity in wages is just one more confirmation of 
this. In January, as always, however, the sphere of science and 
scientific services was in last place with respect to the level 
of wages -- R95,000 on average. The level of wages in instrument 
building is much lower --R71,000. In the past an elite 
subsector, determining to a great extent the rate of technical 
progress, it is currently, just like science and many other 
spheres, leading a miserable existence. 
  At the other extreme are the workers of the fuel and raw 
materials sectors. The gas workers of Tyumen, for example, have 
credited wages of more than a million rubles on average. But 
even here there are problems -- the notorious nonpayment of 
wages, which we have already mentioned. 
  Yet, all the same, the most irritating factor are the insane 
wages of many enterprise managers, including those of state 
enterprises. There is no control over them and the managers, 
"intoxicated by freedom," are setting for themselves, without 
advertising it, such sums as are shameful to talk about in our 
impoverished country. For many of them, the wages range from R5 
million to R10 million. At the same time, the incomes of 18.4 
million people amounted in January to from R10,000 to R30,000 
or, less by hundreds of factors.

  Of course, it would be ludicrous and foolish to fight for 
the 
populist wage-leveling which contradicts both common sense and 
economic laws. But the excessive disparity in wages and incomes, 
especially the uncontrolled and intensifying disparity, is 
leading to mounting social tension in the country. This process 
has been aggravated sharply because of the chronic nonpayments 
(including those for which the state is at fault) of already 
credited wages. Whether or not the Ministry of Labor and the 
current government will be able to correct the situation and 
whether or not they have the skills needed to overcome the 
negative trends and to carry out an effective income policy -- 
this is the question. 
<H5>  A Thousandfold Price Increase and This Is Not the Limit </H5>
  The government proudly reported that the rate of price 
increases was reduced sharply in February. Viktor Chernomyrdin 
stated at the expanded meeting of the government in the Kremlin 
on March 4th that prices in February increased by 13-15 percent. 
In actuality, according to the preliminary data of Russia's 
Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the increase in the 
cost of living was even less -- 10 percent. This is a record low 
inflation level for the last year and a half. But, is this 
something to be proud of? Is this not too high a price for 
reducing the increase in prices? 
  What has played a role here, first and foremost, are the 
enormous arrears with respect to the payment of wages. It is 
understandable: the less cash in hand -- the less the demand -- 
and the lower the prices. But such an artificial reduction of 
inflation causes more harm than good. It is often said that it 
is not a matter of the wage arrears, but rather, the fact that 
our prices have almost reached the level of world prices and 
this is why, supposedly, their rise has slowed down. It should 
be stated that this is not so. A simple analysis shows that, at 
the beginning of March, for example, butter was cheaper in our 
country than in Washington by a factor of 1.5 (taking into 
account the official ruble-to-dollar exchange rate), milk was 
cheaper by a factor of 3.5, cheese by a factor of 2, wheat bread 
by a factor of 3, sugar by a factor of 2, potatoes by a factor 
of 4, and so on. 
  So that here, we still have "room," alas, for price 
increases 
(although they have already increased on average a thousandfold 
over the last 3 and a half years). Thus, it is precisely the 
non-payments which have, to a great extent, had an influence on 
the reduction in the inflation rate. But the debts will have to 
be taken care of -- prices will go up again and such "twists and 
turns" will produce nothing but broad public dissatisfaction. Is 
it really worthwhile to proceed further in this fashion? 
  No, there is only one way out of the dead-end -- a real 
structural reorganization, the attracting of private capital, a 
well thought-out social policy (including an income policy), the 
improvement of the tax system, and support of small business. 
The prime minister has talked about all of these things 
repeatedly. This would be a good time to get down to brass tacks. 
  But, for now, the situation is continuing to deteriorate. 
The 
pace of the drop in production in February did not decrease, as 
the government experts expected, but rather, it remained very 
high. Here is the latest report from Russia's State Committee 
for Statistics: the physical volume of production in January and 
February of 1994 decreased in comparison with January and 
February of 1993 by 23.6 percent (including 23.1 percent in 
January and 24.1 percent in February). For example, only half as 
many shoes were produced in February than were produced a year 
ago, a fourth fewer knitted goods and a third less butter.... 
Where are we going?

<F P=106> [Report by Ye. Lobacheva, expert, under the rubric "Light </F>
Industry": "Survival Strategy"] 
  [Text] The shortage of raw materials and the enormous debt 
of customers to textile industry enterprises have brought this 
sector of the economy to the verge of collapse. 
  In the opinion of experts, the existence of domestic light 
industry depends largely on the strategy which the sectors' 
leaders adopt: to focus the main efforts on getting state 
subsidies or on raising the efficiency of their own production 
by mobilizing internal resources. 
  But it is not easy to do this when we consider that on the 
world market domestic output is not very competitive and demand 
within the country has sharply declined. Moreover, the 
indebtedness of textile industry enterprises' on bank credits 
today totals 243.6 billion rubles [R], while customer 
indebtedness to enterprises totals R245.8 billion, which 
includes overdue debts of R101.4 billion. Textile workers, in 
turn, owe their suppliers R146.4 billion. 
  In the best years Russia produced 5.8 billion square meters 
of cotton fabric, 600 million square meters of flax [linen], 522 
million of wool, and more than 1 billion of silk. It is 
estimated that in 1993 2.2 billion square meters of cotton 
fabric, 330 million square meters of flax, 220 million square 
meters of wool, and 650 million square meters of silk were 
produced. In our opinion, the situation will change very little 
in 1994. The problem of marketing finished output and the higher 
prices and shortage of raw material will be the main reasons for 
the crisis in the sector. By the start of the fourth quarter, 
deliveries of raw materials under intergovernmental agreements 
were 60-percent fulfilled, while certain agreements were not 
fulfilled at all, although purchase prices for raw materials are 
approaching the world level: for wool--80 percent and for 
cotton--80-100 percent of the price on the foreign market. 
  In 1993 the export of Russian textiles to the European 
Community [EC] countries was virtually suspended, which was 
explained formally by the expiration of the 1989 agreement on 
textile trade between the USSR and the EC. In fact the reason 
for it was the general economic decline in Western Europe, which 
was reflected to a greater degree in the textile industry, and 
that led to termination of textile exports to the EC from third 
countries. The development of textile exports in 1994 will be 
complicated by the fact that Russia is intending to sign a 
treaty on partnership and cooperation with the EC where a 
special clause stipulates that Russia will commit itself not to 
exceed established quotas for supplying certain types of textile 
goods. We have about 30 such categories: from cotton fabrics to 
output with a higher degree of processing--raincoats and suits. 
In general, export quotas today suit producers, but textile 
capacities may grow and it will become necessary to increase our 
own exports. 
  The tendency of domestic and world prices for output to 
converge continues, although at the present time this sector 
still has the largest gap between the levels of domestic and 
world prices of any sector; on the average prices for Russian 
output are 12-13 percent of the world prices. 
  The most complicated situation has taken shape in the cotton 
subsector, which is completely dependent on imported raw 
materials. Here the decline in production totals 33 percent of 
the 1992 level. The allocation of R95 billion worth of targeted 
credit to buy raw cotton, negotiations with Uzbekistan, and the 
government's decree "On the Purchase of Imported Raw Cotton for 
State Needs" have not changed the situation in the sector. One 
of the ways to develop the sector proposed by the Ministry of 
Economics is technical re-equipping in order to produce 
competitive output and the involvement of defense enterprises 
with their technical and intellectual potential within the 
framework of the conversion program. 
  In October of the fourth quarter, production of cotton yarn 
grew by 10.8 percent and of cotton fabrics--by 1.3 percent; and 
it is estimated that at the end of the year, the level of 
production had reached 82 percent of the 1992 level. In 1994 
production volumes in the cotton cloth industry will depend on 
deliveries and purchases of raw materials, but according to 
specialists' estimates, no sharp drop in production is expected. 
Because of the need to buy imported raw materials, prices are 
expected to rise and approach world prices, while at this time 
domestic prices are 10-30 percent of world prices. Because of 
purchasing raw materials at future world prices, the rate at 
which prices for final output approach world prices will 
increase.

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-029C-51B>             Dynamics of Prices for Wool Yarn </FIG>




    In 1993 the decline in wool production totaled about 1 
percent of the 1992 level. In October 1993, production of virgin 
wool rose by 10.7 percent and of wool yarn--by 10.3 percent 
(relative to the January 1993 level, production volumes almost 
doubled). For wool fabrics, during the year one could trace an 
absolutely clear pattern of seasonal consumption and shaping of 
the production program based on specific consumer orders. From 
January through April, production rose by 11.5 percent, from May 
through August production dropped by 17 percent, and since 
September production growth is again apparent. On the whole 
production in 1993 remained at the 1992 level. 
  Domestic prices for wool, wool yarn, and fabrics on the 
whole 
underwent a general uptrend and the index in October was 118, 
while in November prices rose by 10-20 percent. Domestic prices 
are 75 percent of world prices for wool, 74 percent for wool 
yarn, and 13 percent for wool fabrics. In 1994 a fairly stable 
situation is anticipated in the wool sector's production, since 
it provides most of the profits and a corresponding share of 
revenue for the budget in the textile industry structure. 
  The present situation in the flax sector is complicated by 
the fact that at the end of September 1993, only 42 percent of 
the volume of flax of the 1992 harvest had been gathered, 
despite the targeted credits to flax processing plants, hemp 
mills, and seed growing stations through the overall credit for 
the agroindustrial complex. Twenty percent of the needed raw 
materials were bought as imports at enterprises' expense. On 25 
August 1993, the government decree "On Development of the 
Federal Target Program `Rebirth of Russian Flax'" was adopted. 
In accordance with this program, production of flax-cotton yarn, 
which has the most profitable and promising export potential, is 
supposed to be developed. This program envisions terminating 
import purchases, including imports purchased with state 
resources. In practice this means accelerated growth in 1994 in 
prices for linen fabrics (because of greater demand) and 
production's dependence on world prices for raw materials (short 
and long flax fiber) as well as our own flax harvest. World 
prices for flax fiber are on the average 4 U.S. dollars, 
yarn--up to 18 U.S. dollars, and fabrics--up to 8 U.S. dollars. 
On the average Russia's domestic prices are 10-40 percent of 
world prices depending on the raw materials used. In 1994 prices 
will obviously rise on the average 3- to 3.5-fold, which will 
make them substantially closer to world prices. 
  In 1993, according to the estimates of ITKOR [Institute of 
Commodity Movement and Conditions of the Wholesale Market], the 
level of production of silk fabrics was 88 percent. But 446.011 
million linear meters were produced in the first 11 months of 
1993 (94 percent of the expected volume). Prices for silk 
fabrics rose an average of 10-fold, which is explained by both 
the rise in raw material prices and the sharp rise in prices for 
energy media. 
  Exports of virgin wool fabrics in 1993 totaled 60 percent of 
the 1992 level; this is related to higher export tariffs as well 
as the drop in production volumes. 
  Demand for virgin wool fabrics is largely determined by 
their 
high price, and no change in the structure of demand is foreseen 
in 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Nikolayevich Petrov, acting general </F>
director of the Fund to Support Business and the Development of 
Competition, by I. Sklyarov: "Entrepreneurs Cannot Do Without 
Government Aid"] 
  [Text] Last year, as we know, the Fund to Support Business 
and the Development of Competition was created by an edict of 
the Russian government for the purpose of organizing and 
rendering real aid by the government to small business. Quite 
possibly, the fund has not yet been operating long enough, but 
readers of EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA and entrepreneurs are 
persistently posing questions regarding what the fund has 
already done, why the results of its work are not evident, 
whether there is any reason to count on it, and others. At the 
request of the editors, some of these questions will be answered 
today by N. Petrov, acting general director of the Fund to 
Support Business and the Development of Competition. 
  [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, first of all we would like 
to hear from you about what results the Fund to Support Business 
began the year with. What was it able to accomplish and what did 
it fail to accomplish in 1993? 
  [Petrov] You know that the path leading to the creation of 
the fund was long and tortuous. It was only on 1 April of last 
year that finally a resolution was issued concerning its 
formation, after which much time and effort was spent on purely 
organizational measures -- the search for facilities, 
confirmation of the state schedule and fund budget, hiring of 
specialists, and so forth. Nevertheless, the fund's supervisory 
council began active work immediately, thereby facilitating a 
solution to organizational-methodological questions. It was 
especially important to establish a mechanism for rendering 
credit-financial aid in order to implement regional programs to 
support business and specific entrepreneurial projects. Among 
our achievements of last year we can include the fact that we 
have already put this mechanism into action by providing credit 
for over two dozen business projects. 
  Now, about the things that we failed to accomplish. The main 
difficulties in implementing the fund's goals have to do with 
limited financial resources allocated to the fund from the 
republic budget. It is no secret that in 1993 we were to receive 
25 billion rubles. But then in connection with making the budget 
more precise this sum was decreased to 15.9 billion rubles. In 
real terms as of the end of last year we received only 7.5 
billion rubles. In assessing these resources please keep the 
inflationary process in mind. In other words, we were not able 
to support business in a volume of at least those 25 billion 
that businessmen were counting on. I say "at least" because in 
late 1993 the fund had accumulated select (i.e., deserving of 
state financial support) programs and projects totalling a sum 
of over 400 billion rubles. 
  [Sklyarov] Yes, it is not a happy picture. What are the 
fund's prospects this year with regard to finances? I have in 
mind the needs as well as the possibilities for receiving assets. 
  [Petrov] As concerns last year's debt to the fund from the 
budget, this sum has been established at 7.8 billion rubles. We 
are making attempts to obtain it, but realistically we can hope 
for only 5 billion. Naturally, the fund's need for budget 
allocations are much greater this year. We have added them up, 
and the results have been included in the draft, "Programs of 
Federal Measures for Government Support of Small Business in 
1994-1995," which was submitted to the government for 
examination. 
  What sums figure into this document? The fund is requesting 
19 billion rubles in 1994 in order to implement measures to 
create an infrastructure that will support business (the 
formation of a normative base, a financial infrastructure, 
systems for providing information to small businesses, for 
training and retraining of personnel, and so forth). In other 
words, this sum is needed to create and begin the support 
mechanism on the necessary level. The second part of the 
program, which is related to the direct implementation of 
regional plans and programs to which the fund has decided to 
contribute financing, is assessed at slightly less than 588 
billion rubles. But this is a general total and requires 
clarification. According to the resolution on the Fund to 
Support Business and the Development of Competition, our share 
in financing regional projects and programs cannot exceed 50 
percent of their cost. Thus the 588 billion rubles consist of 
the following according to source of financing: 153.8 billion 
rubles -- the assets of the businessmen themselves; 170.2 
billion -- from local budgets; 65.1 billion -- expected income 
in an amount equalling 5 percent of privatized federal property; 
7.7 billion -- planned income from invested fund assets; 3.5 
billion -- expected clear income from the sale of bonds, which 
we are preparing to issue; and finally, 206.56 billion rubles -- 
planned allocations directly from the republic budget. 
  [Sklyarov] The sum is actually not that large if we compare 
it to those trillions of rubles that the government intends to 
pour into the giant branches. But if we compare it to last 
year's 25 billion, of which the fund received just a trifle, 
then realistically how can you expect to receive a sum that is 
tenfold larger? 
  [Petrov] There is hope. I can tell you that on 3 February 
the 
government examined the draft for the federal program to support 
business, which I have already mentioned. This year that was the 
first program to be fully approved by the government. Of course, 
Minfin [Ministry of Finance] raised considerable objections 
regarding the figures. I want to clearly state that we plan to 
allocate 206.56 billion rubles from the budget for partial 
financing by the fund of regional programs and projects. In 
response to Minfin's objections, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin 
stated, "We must find the assets. Businessmen cannot do without 
government support." 
  [Sklyarov] These are pretty words. The government has not 
been lacking in such words before... 
  [Petrov] How can I answer here? Where money is invested is 
determined, naturally, by the government's politics and not by 
words... 
  [Sklyarov] All right, let us try to be optimistic and let us 
imagine that the fund has received these 200 billion. Now we 
have the question of effectiveness of use. How dependable is the 
mechanism for bringing the assets to specific businessmen? We 
know, for example, that considerable amounts of government money 
allocated to support farmers reached the land in a very thinned 
out form. 
  [Petrov] You see, our fund's goal is much broader than 
simply 
putting money into specific business programs and projects. This 
money must be returned to us, and in a somewhat increased 
quantity. By share participation in financing we are not simply 
giving away assets; we are investing them and providing credit. 
Yes, the fund has a non-commercial structure; our credit is 
issued at a percentage that for the times may seem symbolic to 
some. Sometimes our credit may be percentage-free. But repayment 
conditions are immutable. This is one of the basic principles of 
fund operations. And believe me, we are not at all interested in 
"loosing" the money that is allocated by us, or in having it 
thrown to the wind, especially since the situation involving the 
receipt of budget allocations by the fund are far from what is 
desired. 
  Who specifically controls the allocation and movement of our 
credit and how? It all begins with a careful selection of 
programs and projects submitted to the fund. This is carefully 
overseen by the fund's supervisory council, consisting, as we 
know, of representatives of several ministries and committees. 
At this stage the main task is to select projects that 
correspond to government economic priorities, that are precisely 
worked out and well-justified, that are capable of providing an 
adequately rapid return, that facilitate the production of goods 
and services needed by the market, and that are capable of 
repaying our credit. Further, the fund's general bank agent, 
Mezhekonomsberbank [International Economic Savings Bank] and its 
local bank agents carry out direct operations to credit and 
control the use of these assets. 
  [Sklyarov] And who in the chain of "general bank 
agent--regional bank agents" guarantees credit and is 
responsible for its repayment? 
  [Petrov] This depends on the credit scheme, of which there 
are four. Regional programs and projects are usually financed in 
the following manner. Mezhekonomsberbank, acting at our fund's 
behest, provides interbank credit to its bank agent, and the 
latter concludes a credit contract directly with the credit 
recipient. In this case the bank agent guarantees the issuance 
and repayment of credit with Mezhekonomsberbank as the fund's 
representative. In the second scheme Mezhekonomsberbank itself 
becomes the bank agent for projects selected by the fund. It 
then becomes responsible for credit repayment and we guarantee 
issuance of credit. The third scheme is similar to this but 
differs in that with the fund's guarantee Mezhekonomsberbank 
issues credit from its own assets. The last scheme has to do 
with the fact that the fund can transfer a portion of its assets 
to the general bank agent for trust administration, establishing 
only the direction of financial projects. In this case all 
credit responsibility is placed on the bank. But we are not yet 
utilizing this variant because the fund does not have sufficient 
assets at its disposal. 
  [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, the press has been critical 
of the fact that of last year's 7.5 billion rubles received by 
the fund, you directed 2 billion into Mezhekonomsberbank's 
charter fund instead of crediting these assets to businessmen. 
What can you say about this? 
  [Petrov] Are these expenditures justified? Let us take a 
look. By moving into the bank's charter capital as one of the 
main founders, the fund will thereby considerably expand its 
financial possibilities, since the bank takes upon itself 
obligations that will enable it to do the following: to provide 
bank guarantees to small enterprises for obtaining credit in 
commercial banks, to increase assets for providing credit to 
small business using assets of the general bank agent itself, to 
administer the bank business support system, and finally, to 
receive a dividend from investment capital and in the form of 
income for bank guarantees provided to small business, thus 
increasing the fund's financial resources. I can tell you, for 
example, that according to the average monthly balance in our 
Mezhekonomsberbank current account, the fund receives an income 
that is double that of the bank's regular clients. 
  It is all well and good to provide credit for business 
projects and programs. But world experience proved long ago that 
effective government support of small business and its extensive 
development are impossible without the creation of the 
corresponding infrastructure, an integral part of which is 
credit-financial, insurance and leasing organizations. Since 
there is no one but our fund to deal with this problem on a 
federal level, we will continue to seek and invest assets in 
infrastructure development. 
  [Sklayrov] I think that you yourself have heard criticism 
from businessmen that the fund operates secretly, that it is 
difficult to receive an answer from you regarding why you accept 
or reject a particular project for financing and 
correspondingly, regarding where fund assets go. 
  [Petrov] I have already mentioned the criteria for the 
selection of projects. I should note that most businessmen 
simply submit poor quality materials to the fund. It happens 
that they request considerable sums without explaining how they 
intend to spend them. Naturally, we do not even look at such 
requests. In addition, I think you will agree that regardless of 
the financial possibilities of our fund there will always be 
businessmen who are "insulted" as well as those who "are lucky 
enough" to receive our support. We will always have to make 
choices regarding which projects to give preference to. 
  [Sklyarov] Could you mention some small businesses which 
have 
already been "lucky enough" to receive aid from you? 
  [Petrov] There are no secrets here. This includes Kaluga's 
"Progress" TOO [limited liability partnership], to which we gave 
credit to create a mini-bakery. "Alfa" AO [joint-stock company] 
of Belorechensk, Krasnodar Kray, which has production and 
storage facilities, received credit to procure equipment for 
producing soy milk and other soy products, including livestock 
feed. Penza's "Karteks" AO, which has experience in 
manufacturing equipment for mini-mills and churns, was allocated 
capital to begin manufacturing potato-processing complexes. In 
the city of Zheleznodorozhnyy, Moscow Oblast, "Uchprofprom" TOO 
received our credit to produce furniture for schools and 
children's institutions. We provided capital to "Kredo" AO of 
Zlatoust, Chelyabinsk Oblast, to manufacture bactericidal 
irradiation equipment used in medicine as well as in livestock 
raising. 
  We can spend a great deal of time enumerating recipients of 
fund support. I will say only that as of late January of this 
year we have already provided credit for 24 projects totalling 
approximately 5 billion rubles. 
  [Sklyarov] Nikolay Nikolayevich, how do you feel about 
creating a type of advisory council for the fund, made up of 
representatives of public associations, small businessmen, 
scientific experts and specialists? Perhaps this would diffuse 
mistrust and criticism among businessmen with regard to the fund? 
  [Petrov] The resolution on the Fund to Support Business and 
the Development of Competition that was confirmed by the 
government does not call for this at all. But we are keeping the 
creation of such an organ in mind. How to implement it is 
another matter. This is not as simple as it seems. You know that 
in Russia we have countless numbers of all kinds of unions, 
associations and organizations for small businesses, many of 
which are phony structures that do not represent any MP [small 
business]. But all of them demand government support, especially 
financial. All of them are pulling the blanket up over 
themselves. This is why as of now we do not see how we can 
create a public organ within the fund and keep our joint work 
constructive. 
  I think that right now we must simply more broadly inform 
the 
public and business circles about the fund's operations. I hope 
that EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN will help us in this. 
  [Sklyarov] Don't worry about this, as long as your side 
continues to have an interest in doing this. Thank you for the 
interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Tsukanova, economic expert of the </F>
Russian Privatization Center, State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property, under the rubric "Draft Law," 
with introduction by Olga Samarina, DELOVOY MIR: "Monopolies in 
the Market Will Get a `Record' If the Law `On Natural and State 
Monopolies' Is Passed"] 
  [Text] A market economy in our country is being born 
in torment; as a consequence, appeals by some economists and 
politicians to reinforce direct methods for regulating the 
economy and controlling prices have been voiced with increasing 
frequency. However, it has not been refined what specifically 
they propose to regulate. Is it the entire economy or just 
certain sectors and groups of commodities? Which specific 
methods do they propose to use to this end? 
  As the experience of past years testifies, state 
regulation of the operation of monopoly enterprises has turned 
out to be inefficient. Hopes for privatization have been dashed. 
Sectoral lobbies have again reconstituted monopoly enterprises 
behind the facade of various joint-stock companies. It is 
necessary to influence this process by civilized methods rather 
than by a straightforward fight by the state against such 
enterprises. The developers of the draft Law "On Natural and 
State Monopolies" from the Antimonopoly Committee and the 
Russian Privatization Center of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property are convinced of this. 
  Within several days the federal government of the 
Russian Federation will review the draft of this law. Last week 
it already gained approval at a conference of the Ministry of 
the Economy. In a word, the government has made the first 
attempt to restrict state regulation of enterprises to a legal 
framework. The objective of legal provisions in the draft law is 
to strike a balance between the interests of consumers and 
monopoly producers, as well as to standardize relations between 
sectoral committees and enterprises. The latter may make it 
possible to reduce the influence of subjective factors on 
economic policy as a whole. 
  At the request of a DELOVOY MIR commentator, Natalya 
Tsukanova, economic expert of the Russian Privatization Center, 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property, and one 
of the authors of the draft law, comments on it. 
  In any economy there are spheres in which the setting of 
prices by the market is not optimal. Natural 
monopolies, i.e., sectors in which the development of 
competition is impossible or ineffective, are the foremost of 
such areas. The task of the state with regard to a small number 
of these sectors is not to put an end to monopoly operations but 
rather to provide conditions for the regulation of their 
operation on a permanent basis. What are natural 
monopolies? These are sectors or spheres of operation of which 
two main features are characteristic. 
  First, the manufacturing of products in such sectors is more 
effective in an environment of absence of competition. This is 
associated with the fact that, due to certain technological 
peculiarities, production in these sectors exhibits a 
substantial reduction in specific cost as the volume of 
production grows. This is, as a rule, a result of considerable 
economies on the scale of production and high fixed costs which 
makes monopoly production more effective. Pipeline 
transportation, water supply systems, and railroads are among 
such sectors. Indeed, it does not occur to anyone to build two 
sets of water mains or two sewer systems. Fixed costs entailed 
by building such structures are so high that a parallel system 
which performs the same functions would hardly pay for itself. 
The more people who use one and the same water supply system, 
the lower the outlays are for serving each one of them. In the 
same way, the more people travel by railway, the lower the 
outlays on carrying one passenger by rail. 
  Second, the demand for products or services generated by 
natural monopoly entities is less dependent on changes in prices 
than the demand for other types of products (services), because 
products (services) generated by natural monopoly entities 
cannot be replaced with other goods to be consumed. The products 
in question meet the most significant needs of the population or 
are irreplaceable for other industries. Such products include, 
for example, electricity, telephone communication services, and 
railway transportation. Let us assume that an increase in car 
prices forces many consumers to give up the purchase of their 
own cars and to use public transit or, at least, postpone the 
purchase, whereas even a significant increase in the price of 
electricity will hardly bring about discontinuation of its 
use--we are not used to living without light; besides, 
refrigerators, TV sets, and washing machines are operated in 
many apartments. It is quite difficult to substitute for the 
consumption of electricity. 
  Under the circumstances, an enterprise generating such 
products (services), that is, a "natural monopoly," gets an 
opportunity to set prices well above the actual cost of 
production. This is precisely why in all countries "natural 
monopoly" enterprises are either owned by the state or regulated 
by the state on a permanent basis. As a rule, "natural 
monopolies" are regulated by special independent agencies whose 
operation is governed by relevant legislative acts. For example, 
telephone communications enterprises are regulated by the 
Federal Communications Commission in the United States, by the 
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL) in Great Britain, and by 
the Canadian Television and Telecommunications Commission in 
Canada. 
  What methods are used to regulate natural monopolies? Since 
natural monopoly entities have an opportunity to dictate their 
prices to customers, as well as to deny services to them, the 
regulatory organs obligate the natural monopoly entities to 
supply the goods produced by them to certain groups of consumers 
and resort to price regulation methods, i.e., they specify the 
level and structure of prices for groups of consumers or the 
profit margin, and control the structure and composition of 
costs. Since natural monopoly entities may try to overstate 
their actual costs by allocating too much funding to develop 
their main line of production, as well as to develop the 
manufacturing of products for which prices are not regulated, 
the regulatory organs approve investment plans with a view to 
developing the production of natural monopoly goods, authorize 
the natural monopoly entities to issue stock and bonds and to 
attract borrowed funds, and also authorize investment to develop 
the production of goods on which there is no monopoly. Finally, 
effective regulation is only possible on the condition that 
complete and authentic information is available to the 
regulatory organs. For this reason, the natural monopoly 
entities have the obligation to provide information on financial 
and production operations in a format developed by the 
regulatory organ and inform consumers about changes in prices 
for products. The regulatory organs approve rules for accounting 
and statistical reporting. 
  Such careful control over natural monopolies is due to the 
fact that a conflict is unavoidable in this area between the 
interests of "natural monopoly" producers and consumers, with 
the market mechanism being "inadequate" to resolve it. This is 
precisely why the need emerges for an "arbiter," or an 
independent regulatory organ which, having taken into account 
the interests and information provided by both parties, makes 
decisions on the basis of a professional expert review. 
Therefore, the natural monopolies amount to the areas of 
operation in which the attention of the state should indeed be 
focused on the development of a regulatory system using methods 
that are unacceptable in other sectors, in particular, the 
regulation of prices. As we see it, it is precisely the 
direction on which to concentrate the efforts to create a system 
of active state regulation that is adequate in a market 
environment. 
  In the process of the application of specific regulatory 
methods (the setting of maximum profit margins or prices, the 
consideration of the issue of a merger between a natural 
monopoly entity and another enterprise, and so on), the organs 
which it is proposed to charge with regulating the natural 
monopolies must take into account information and views of all 
interested parties, that is, the natural monopoly entities, the 
Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and 
Support of New Economic Structures and its territorial 
administrations, consumers, sectoral ministries, and other 
organs of power and government. The regulatory organs must 
inform the public through the mass media about their decisions 
with regard to the methods used to regulate the operation of 
natural monopoly entities, as well as about specific indicators 
and requirements for the natural monopoly entities. 
  At the same time, the law grants considerable independence 
and freedom to the regulatory organs. They do not report to any 
state structure and make their decisions on the basis of a 
professional expert review of the situation in a sector. If a 
regulatory organ exceeds its authority or fails to perform the 
functions assigned to it, the natural monopoly entities, 
consumers (personally or through a public organization of 
consumers), as well as the Committee for Antimonopoly Policy, 
may appeal to the Court of Arbitration, which may cancel the 
unlawful decision.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Shiryayev, deputy director of the Moscow </F>
Government's Department of Finances, by Igor Ostrovskiy; date 
and place not given: "A War of the Banks or a Victory of Market 
Thinking?"] 
  [Text] During the past week, the mass information 
media have actively discussed the decision of Yu. Luzhkov, 
Moscow's mayor, to transfer the city's budget account to six 
proxy banks: Menatop, Most-Bank, National Credit, Capital, 
Tekhnobank, and Orbita. The commercial People's Bank managed the 
budget money up until now. Some commentators consider the city 
government's decision a victory for the lobbyists for a (group) 
of banks that have decided to divide the budget pie. Others see 
in it a manifestation of market relations in a delicate area 
like the implementation of the city's budget. V. Shiryayev, 
deputy director of the Moscow government's Department of 
Finance, talks about the motives of the Moscow government's 
financiers. 
  [Shiryayev] We did not start thinking yesterday about the 
need to improve the settlement system with the city's on-budget 
organizations. The unpleasant situation with the Bank for 
Foreign Economic Relations, which delayed a multi-billion 
payment to the Department of Construction for four days in 
September, accelerated the decision. Three similar cases are on 
the accounts of the People's Bank. These were not premeditated 
delays but breakdowns in the electronic systems of the Central 
Bank's Inter-Regional Information Center. However, you will 
agree that this did not make it easier for those who did not 
receive their wages on time. Based on common sense, we 
understood that there is no and cannot be any modern bank 
capable of coping by itself with such a bulky and cumbersome 
thing as Moscow's budget. I will say for informational purposes 
that it exceeded three trillion rubles last year. 
  We are not the only ones thinking about how to organize the 
management of local budgets. Russia's Ministry of Finance, for 
example, considers it necessary to establish a network of 
regional treasuries which would assume these functions. The idea 
of municipal banks is also being heard. Neither the first nor 
the second suggestion is acceptable to us. Where would we get 
the billions to support the treasuries? Where would we get the 
money to form the charter funding of a municipal bank? That is 
why we selected our own, a Moscow, variant -- to work with six 
proxy banks. We will receive results without expending a single 
budget kopek. 
  [Ostrovskiy] Some specialists are saying that you will 
receive six bank monopolies instead of one and that nothing will 
really be changed? 
  [Shiryayev] I want to call the specialist's attention to the 
document adopted by Moscow's government on 22 February. It is 
called "On Improving the Conditions for Bank Clearing Operations 
for Accounts Using the City of Moscow's Budget and the On-Budget 
and Off-Budget Accounts of Municipal Institutions and 
Organizations." Our vision for the interaction of the city's 
government with commercial banks is formulated there. We are 
talking about establishing a powerful information system and 
common standard documents. We want to achieve the "transparency" 
of accounts, that is, to obtain access to them at any second and 
receive complete information about what is being done with 
budget money. With the help of the proxy banks, we want to 
construct a settlement vertical line, that is, a system thanks 
to which each on-budget city organization would receive its 
upkeep on the precisely defined day. 
  [Ostrovskiy] Are you confident that the banks selected by 
you 
will cope with this task? 
  [Shiryayev] We hope so. The experience from our cooperation 
with Most-Bank, which manages the health accounts, strengthens 
our hopes. The vertical line, about which I spoke, has worked in 
two municipal okrugs. There, questions concerning financing do 
not arise among health care workers. The proxy banks, for 
example, have suggested adding interest to the daily remainder 
in the accounts. The money will probably not be very much but we 
are happy for any additional kopek because of the very acute 
budgetary shortage. 
  [Ostrovskiy] The People's Bank did not provide you these 
services? 
  [Shiryayev] At any rate, it did not propose them to us. You 
will agree that a bank should devise conditions beneficial to 
such a sizable customer as Moscow's government under market 
conditions. Concerning the monopoly of six proxy banks over the 
jurisdiction of the budget accounts, I assure you that the list 
is not closed. We are prepared to discuss suggestions, including 
with the People's Bank.

<F P=106> [Article by Pentti Laitinen: "Soviet Trade Guaranties Forced </F>
Guaranty Agency Into the Red"] 
  [Excerpts] The total loss experienced by the Foreign Trade 
Credit Guaranty Agency amounted to 572 million markkas [FMk], of 
which the largest portion can be attributed to credit guaranties 
issued for trade deals with the former USSR, for which payments 
are now overdue. Another single item that strongly affects the 
bottom line of the Credit Guaranty Agency is the annual payment 
pertaining to the settlement of Wartsila Meriteollisuus. 
  The export recovery increased the demand for the agency's 
services by more than 25 percent. The agency's total guaranty 
commitment for last year was FMk53 billion, of which the export 
guaranties' share was 86 percent. 
  The objective of the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency 
has 
been defined as the promotion of exports and strengthening the 
operating conditions of small and medium-size industry. The 
tools available to the agency to further these goals are export 
guaranties and state guaranties, which can be granted to 
businesses and financiers. 
<H5>  Credit Guaranty Payments -- 145 Million </H5>
  Compensation received from state guaranties and export 
guaranties amounted to FMk145 million. Based on these, the 
Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency paid FMk206 million in 
compensation. This was FMk72 million less than in 1992. The 
guaranties issued for trade with the former USSR resulted in 
compensation payments of FMk536 million. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  3 Billion Total Liabilities </H5>
  At the beginning of last year, the total liability for trade 
with the USSR was less than FMk3 billion, which had accrued 
during the 1980's as a result of long-term financing. The Credit 
Guaranty Agency submits payments for interest and principal to 
the banks as they become due . 
  The loans will later be collected from Russia, in a manner 
which will be determined by the international conference of 
creditors or the so-called Paris Club. 
  The Paris Club is planning to extend long-term credit and 
low 
interest rates for trade with the east. Due to the fact that the 
procedures for collecting these debts have still not been set in 
place, it has not been possible to carry them forward. 
  According to Matti Vuorian, section head and chair of the 
board of directors for the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency, 
there is also great demand for new guaranties for trade with 
Russia, "but the decisions must wait until the creditor 
countries have made their final decision regarding debt 
consolidation." 
  According to CEO Ilkka Niemi, the Credit Guaranty Agency's 
opportunities to conduct business are not dependent upon the 
methods of collecting outstanding debts, which are accrued from 
trade with the east. At the beginning of the current year, the 
book risk ceiling of export guarantees was increased to FMk45 
billion. According to Niemi, this allows for FMk70 billion in 
trade guarantees. Also, according to Niemi, disregarding the 
credits issued for the trade with the former USSR and the 
commitments to Wartsila Meriteollisuus' incidental traffic, the 
profits generated by the Credit Guaranty Agency are on a good 
international level. Balancing the approximately FMk200 million 
in other compensation are FMk145 million of guaranty payments. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Slight Decrease in Estonia's Risk Level </H5>
  So far, guaranties have not been issued to Baltic states, 
which were formerly part of the USSR. However, the agency's 
board of directors decided last Thursday [10 February] to adjust 
Estonia's risk rating to the extent that short-term letters of 
credit could be guaranteed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Viktor Zorin, Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service chief, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "A New Old Boss"] 
  [Text] In an edict dated 4 February, the president 
appointed 23 candidates to the most important positions in the 
FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service]. Almost all the 
highest-ranking officials of the former MB [Ministry of 
Security] have undergone recertification. 
  One of the key departments in the new service's 
structure is the counterintelligence operations directorate. The 
official appointed as this directorate's chief is Lieutenant 
General Viktor Mikhaylovich Zorin, who held an analogous 
position in the MB. We asked Viktor Mikhaylovich to comment on 
the current changes in the security organs. 
  [Zorin] Speaking of reforming the special services in 
general, our foreign colleagues, including the Americans, are 
continuously in a process of reform, albeit perhaps not as 
cardinal as ours. The process of reform is underway in the 
intelligence directorate of the U.S. Department of Defense; a 
number of CIA services are being reoriented. 
  As to our reform, it is a logical extension of what began in 
1991. Or, if we dismiss all ideological coatings, we can 
probably even speak of 1989, when the Fifth (ideological) 
Department of the USSR KGB was disbanded. 
  The current reform is aimed at transforming us into a 
special 
service. This means first and foremost removing from the FSK 
system punitive, repressive functions. We no longer have an 
investigative department. Inquiry remains--this is a necessary 
procedure. Neither do we have places of incarceration 
anymore--the investigative detention facility in Lefortovo has 
been transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. 
  [Question] As applied to your directorate--how was the old 
structure different from the one being formed now? 
  [Zorin] The name of our directorate has changed--it is now 
closer to what we actually do. Instead of a counterintelligence 
directorate it became the counterintelligence operations 
directorate. Because our main function is working against 
foreign special services on the territory of Russia and their 
stations, the conduct of operations to frustrate intelligence 
actions. For instance, the directorate of counterintelligence 
support for strategic objects is to a great extent "object-based 
counterintelligence," whose main function is protection of the 
latter. 
  In line with the changes in main tasks, corresponding 
structural changes took place. A number of departments and lines 
have been reduced; some have been strengthened. 
  [Question] American reforms probably also are associated 
with 
our new conditions in Russia? 
  [Zorin] We have information that Russia remains a priority 
target for American special services. They demonstrate that they 
have reduced their activities on the territory of Russia and are 
not conducting agent operations--sort of keeping their 
gentlemen's promise. But this does not at all mean that their 
work has been curtailed. 
  Nontraditional methods and sources are being widely used, in 
the form of various kind of firms, commissions, foundations, 
including informational. If you read the questionnaires that are 
being published you can see that with skillful processing you 
can get excellent intelligence information that sometimes cannot 
be obtained through agents. 
  Western special services use the territories of contiguous 
states, including former Soviet republics and socialist 
countries. Cooperation with the special services of the latter 
has helped us lately to keep an eye on foreign intelligence 
services. And they are today, to use military language, a 
beachhead. 
  The direct contacts we have with representatives of foreign 
intelligence services permit us to remove some issues in a 
civilized manner. Although in this respect we also have 
problems. For instance, a foreign state officially declares a 
representative of its intelligence service on the territory of 
Russia. Protecting him to an even greater extent by refusing 
similar status for our representative. 
  [Question] You no longer have an investigations department. 
Have you not lost the main tool of your work? 
  [Zorin] Our main work is operations. Investigation is the 
concluding part of our efforts; now the procuracy will do this. 
  [Question] Who is now directly involved in exposing spies? 
  [Zorin] Operations services. They are also, as a rule, the 
ones who detain them. With the procurator's sanction, of course. 
And then we help him, if the investigation requires it. 
  [Question] How did your certification go? 
  [Zorin] There was a goodwill atmosphere in the commission. 
The questions covered a person's professional qualities, his 
work experience, and a certain part of political views. I think, 
though, that for counterintelligence the latter did not play a 
major role. Especially keeping in mind that this was less 
relevant for our directorate's staff: We were not involved in 
political surveillance. 
  [Question] Did the interview resemble an exam? 
  [Zorin] To a certain extent, yes. I was told to come at a 
certain time, so I came. The personnel department chief came out 
and invited me in. I entered and saw that in the center was Oleg 
Lobov. We exchanged greetings; I was offered a seat: How are you 
doing? How is work? What problems are there in the directorate? 
Sergey Adamovich Kovalev (the president's adviser on human 
rights--D.Kh.) asked: "I see you have worked in many places, 
have you not?" I said: "Sergey Adamovich, I understand your 
question. You want to know whether I have worked in the fifth 
line? No, I have not. I began in Checheno-Ingushetia; then Orel 
Oblast, graduate study, the former Committee. Always in 
counterintelligence, including at secret plants. But sometimes I 
happened to run into political issues." Then Vladimir 
Arsenyevich Rubanov (Lobov's deputy--D.Kh.) asked about the 
problem of diplomatic security, whether there is a law. One of 
our directorate's functions is to ensure the security of our 
citizens abroad. I say: "There is no law, but we have submitted 
a proposal on how to solve this problem." All in all, the 
conversation lasted about half an hour. 
  [Question] Was the decision made on the spot? 
  [Zorin] No, the decision was announced later and affirmed by 
presidential edict. 
  [Question] Now you have to conduct recertification of your 
directorate's staff. How are you going to go about it? 
  [Zorin] We have organized a commission and included in it 
the 
most authoritative people, mainly top officials, as well as 
personnel department staff. The commission will work according 
to a statute that has been drafted in keeping with the 
president's edict. The subjects of evaluation will be 
professional qualities, work results, and moral qualities. 
  [Question] So you will be evaluating "how many spies a 
person 
has caught"? 
  [Zorin] Not just that. In counterintelligence, arresting a 
spy is far from the only, and not always the best, result. We 
know from history that on the threshold of the war with Germany 
the British did not arrest a single German agent. When the war 
started, they took them all at the same time, leaving only one 
or two. And German intelligence basically did not score any 
serious successes in England during the entire war. 
  [Question] Is the possibility of getting rid of undesirable 
staff members during certification ruled out? 
  [Zorin] There is a law on military service. It regulates the 
procedures for discharge from service. All actions of the 
commission fall clearly within the boundaries of the law. 
Otherwise these days you will face endless litigation. 
  [Question] Can a discharged person turn to the court? 
  [Zorin] This is his right as a citizen. 
  [Question] Do you believe that in the future, decades from 
now, the functions of counterintelligence will die out? 
  [Zorin] Way back in the institute we all memorized that this 
could possibly happen when the function of the state dies out. 
Then probably there will be no counterintelligence. 
Historically, as soon as a conflict situation arises, there is 
immediately a need for countering intelligence. 
Counterintelligence existed under Ivan the Terrible, and Peter 
the Great--the famous Romodanovskiy. In principle, the system of 
questioning at the border, travel documents, already had a 
counterintelligence function. 
  In tsarist Russia, by the way, counterintelligence was quite 
sophisticated. And the Germans' failures in the beginning of the 
first world war, especially at sea, to a certain extent could be 
traced to the fact that Russian counterintelligence outplayed 
them. 
  I believe that today counterintelligence emerges and is 
present wherever there is threat to Russia's security, wherever 
intelligence activities are conducted. 
  The same correspondent may ask openly: "How many ballistic 
missiles do you have in such and such oblast?" We probably 
should not condemn him for this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Nikolay Mikheyev, chief of the </F>
Federal Counterintelligence Service Military-Medical 
Administration, by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondents Dmitriy 
Kholodov and Vladimir Murashkin; place and DATe not given: "The 
One and Indivisible Property of Special Services: KGB Leadership 
Liked To Vacation in Yalta"] 
  [Text] It is forbidden to take photos at the KGB 
resort. Our MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondents learned this 
as soon as they pulled out their cameras. Among those who 
vacation here are not only staff officers of state security but 
also members of the covert staff and illegal agents who, quite 
obviously, do not want their photos taken even for such a widely 
read newspaper as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. For the same reason, 
the resort is located in a quiet corner of Moscow Oblast and is 
surrounded by a good fence--no strangers are permitted on its 
territory. 
  "Moskvich" is one of MB's [Ministry of Security] recreation 
facilities, which are now under the jurisdiction of the 
Military-Medical Administration of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FSK]. It was built quite recently, 
in 1989. It can accommodate 810 guests and serves the FSK, the 
SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service], the GUO [Main Protection 
Directorate], the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information], and the border troops--every 
agency that has emerged in Russia in place of the KGB since the 
reforms of 1991-1993. 
  "Why did the agencies that emerged during the reform of the 
special services decide not to divide the KGB sanitariums and 
resorts but instead left everything under the FSK umbrella?" our 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent asked Major General Nikolay 
Mikheyev, chief of the FSK Military-Medical Administration. 
  [Mikheyev] Take the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium in 
Sochi--how do you divide it? And the only hospital? All the 
services--the FAPSI, the main directorate for protection of 
president, intelligence, the border troops, and so on--supported 
the idea of keeping the medical services together as a whole. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Is there a lot to divide? 
  [Mikheyev] Four and a half thousand accommodations. There 
are 
seven sanitariums and eight resorts--in the North Caucasus, at 
Caucasus mineral waters (Kislovodsk, Mineralnyye Vody), and the 
central belt of the European part of Russia. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Did you lose a lot after the 
disintegration of the USSR? 
  [Mikheyev] About 50 percent of available capacity. Since 
1991, 15 health facilities--eight sanitariums, four resorts, and 
three pioneer camps--have been transferred to the jurisdiction 
of independent states. In Ukraine--in Crimea, near Kiev, and in 
Odessa. Three health facilities were left in Georgia and one in 
the Baltics. Our children mainly spent their vacations in 
Ukraine. Since the disintegration of the USSR we do not have any 
children's camps on the Black Sea shore. By presidential edict a 
pioneer camp in Anapa, which previously belonged to Ukrainian 
enterprises, has been transferred to us. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How did the nationalization of KGB 
property proceed in the republics? 
  [Mikheyev] We were simply informed. That is all. For 
instance, in Georgia: the Samshitovaya Roshcha sanitarium in 
Pitsunda for 850 accommodations, absolutely new--built just two 
years ago. Now the property of the information and intelligence 
service of Georgia. The future of the sanitarium is unknown. We 
have to enter into agreements with the independent states: With 
Ukraine, we swap vouchers. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How much does it cost to vacation 
in 
a security organ sanitarium? 
  [Mikheyev] Because of inflation, prices keep going up. In 
1991 a voucher cost 400 rubles [R]. Now it is on average 
R140,000-160,000. For 21-24 days, room and board included. By 
law, members of special services, as military personnel, have 
allowances. The wife gets the voucher at 50 percent of the cost, 
the officer--25 percent. That is, he pays R40,000. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Do all officers vacation in equal 
accommodations? Are there not some privileged sanitariums for 
higher-ranking personnel or state-owned dacha complexes? 
  [Mikheyev] The Military-Medical Administration does not have 
dacha complexes. Everybody vacations in the same manner, eats in 
the same cafeteria. There are resorts that have been built 
recently. They are better--they have rooms for two. Those built 
before the war as a rule have four persons per room. There are 
upgraded accommodations--two-room suites, but for an extra cost. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Where do the top people in your 
agency like to vacation? 
  [Mikheyev] In the summer many of those who had vacations 
went 
to Sochi, to the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium. In the past, 
they liked Yalta very much. Kislovodsk is popular--for some 
reason, they prefer the old building there, built in the park 
zone in 1932, although there is now also a new one, with more 
conveniences. 
  [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] And the last question. How are 
vouchers divided between the agencies? 
  [Mikheyev] In proportion to personnel numbers. Everybody has 
equal conditions. We regularly exchange opinions on this 
subject. There is no problem with this. There is a different 
kind of a problem. For instance, we do not have any sanitariums 
or resorts in the Asian part. One is only now under construction 
in Vladivostok. Meanwhile, people from those regions do not come 
here--travel costs are too high. We have to make arrangements 
with the Ministry of Defense and the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs]. They accommodate our requests. In exchange, we give 
them vouchers here, in the European part. [end Mikheyev] 
  Small buildings hide among pine trees. Cozy 
rooms--"three-star"--are furnished with custom-made furniture. 
The sports complex has a large year-round swimming pool (still 
functions). 
  Among recent guests here were Americans who came from 
the International Sports Association to award belts to our 
officers--karate specialists: special services staff train and 
take exams here, at the resort. 
  There are two ways to vacation in "Moskvich." To apply 
to the FSK and pay the full cost--about R14,000 a day. Or get 
recruited as, for instance, a covert agent and vacation for 25 
percent of the cost. Your choice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Intelligence Service officer </F>
Boris Petrovich K., by Vladimir Sedykh; date and place not 
given: "Intelligence Officer at the Service of Science and 
Technology"] 
  [Text] We met with Boris Petrovich K. in the mansion 
on a twisting Moscow street known to everyone writing on 
espionage topics. It houses the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [FSK] press service. As to our interlocutor, his service 
record in intelligence goes back as far as 1952. Behind him are 
four extended foreign tours of duty and a couple of dozen short 
trips. Not every experienced professional intelligence officer 
can boast such a service record. All Boris Petrovich himself 
said, however, was that for 40 years he had been an intelligence 
officer at the service of science and technology. 
  [Sedykh] Please explain what you mean by this. 
  [K.] All my career has been associated with scientific and 
technological [S&amp;T] intelligence, whose main task is to track 
advanced foreign technologies and obtain the appropriate 
information, as well as samples, for the purpose of improving 
the scientific and industrial potential of our country. The 
needs of the military-industrial complex [VPK], weapons of mass 
destruction, and developments in the area of critical 
technologies were given priority, of course. That is, those 
areas that represented a direct threat to our national security. 
In the greater scheme of things, I made my own small 
contribution to the acceleration of scientific-technical 
progress. 
  [Sedykh] This sounds sort of academic. Why do you not give 
some concrete examples of useful returns from S&amp;T 
intelligence, 
or to put it plainly, industrial espionage. 
  [K.] Whichever name you call this line of foreign 
intelligence work, compared to other lines of work--political 
intelligence, foreign counterintelligence, illegal 
intelligence--S&amp;T is the most profitable. Let me start with 
the 
fact that information obtained by our staff on the problems of 
nuclear energy enabled Soviet science, with considerable savings 
in material resources and time, to create atomic weapons and 
deprive our main enemy of the time--the United States--of the 
ability to use nuclear blackmail. We seriously helped our 
scientists in industrial applications of powder metallurgy. Not 
too many people know that S&amp;T provided anticipatory 
information 
on the spread abroad of a dangerous illness--AIDS, and its 
medical and biological parameters. S&amp;T also provided 
important 
information for the work on eliminating the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster. 
  As you can see, S&amp;T is aimed not only at perfecting 
technical 
ideas, but also protecting the interests of humanity. And there 
is probably no need to prove the cost-effectiveness of S&amp;T 
intelligence. It has never had government handouts and never 
cost our taxpayers a penny. 
  [Sedykh] If you do not mind, let us move from the general to 
particular. For instance, what was your work day like in 
intelligence? 
  [K.] First I would like to point out that intelligence work 
assumes maximum levels of strength, will power, and nerves. 
Naturally, I, just like my colleagues, tried not to set myself 
apart in any way from the bulk of our diplomats, specialists, 
and other "clean" personnel abroad. I will not reveal a great 
secret, however, in telling you that within half a year the 
special services of the country of assignment learned who is who 
in our colony. While the "clean" staff of foreign 
representations consider themselves off duty after 1700, we 
continue working. Therefore it is very important to mask your 
activism--explain it, for instance, by a character trait: I am 
such a restless person that I even work in the evenings. 
  [Sedykh] Did you succeed? 
  [K.] In principle, you can fool the special services. With 
me, for instance, as we found out later, they assumed for a long 
time that I was a KGB co-optee but not that I was a career 
officer. Still, the most important part for us is to not expose 
our sources. 
  [Sedykh] How do you do that? 
  [K.] To mask specific interest in particular persons you 
have 
to surround yourself with numerous acquaintances and business 
connections, that is, official contacts. This is particularly 
important at the stage of assessing foreigners who potentially 
could be of interest from an intelligence standpoint. With 
agents, you have different problems. The most vulnerable area in 
the system of special relations is the personal meeting. That is 
why intelligence frequently resorts to impersonal forms of 
contacts with agents--through dead drops or radioelectronic 
exchange of information. It also goes without saying that you 
have to be able to skillfully dodge physical surveillance. 
  [Sedykh] Speaking of the latter. Boris Petrovich, tell us 
some methods of foiling this greatest evil for an intelligence 
officer. 
  [K.] In West European countries, where I worked most, the 
embassy and our other representations were usually under 
constant surveillance. However, the resources of the opponent's 
special service are not limitless. We took advantage of this; 
for instance, we simulated conferences or mass events at the 
embassy and then fanned out in the city. They would pick up one 
or two of ours, but the rest would have a chance to break off. 
Or, two or three intelligence officers get in a car, with the 
operational driver behind the wheel. At a certain point on the 
route--safe from the viewpoint of surveillance--the colleague 
who has to conduct an operation jumps out of the car and escapes 
surveillance. When a meeting is planned with an especially 
valuable agent, or an important operation, the rezidentura as a 
rule also conducts countersurveillance, to make sure that the 
intelligence officer is not "tailed" by the opponent. I 
personally accustomed the surveillance to my habit of drinking 
coffee every day at 1100 in the same restaurant. For a day, a 
week, a month they dutifully followed me there. Then I noticed 
that they had stopped. Once in a while they would check that I 
still indulged in my coffee habit, and then lay off. This is 
when I went into action. 
  [Sedykh] Let us say you have your coffee at 1100. Nobody 
follows you. You can have a meeting with your source. Where, and 
how? 
  [K.] Usually in restaurants--naturally, those that are not 
anywhere close to state and government buildings, police or 
gendarmerie, or military facilities. I should note that the 
meeting place must be recorded in the rezidentura, so that none 
of our other people would show up there and, God forbid, bring a 
tail. So we eat and drink. I take the documents, give him the 
next assignment (I am generalizing, of course), the source gets 
the money, and we each go our own way. Sometimes the materials 
have to be returned to the agent in a matter of hours. Then you 
have to work with a partner who copies the documents right in 
the car while you are having your meal. 
  [Sedykh] Tell me please about an unexpected episode in your 
professional practice. 
  [K.] There was an incident--quite recent, by the way. 
Therefore I will avoid details and specific descriptions. One 
category of our clients are the so-called walk-ins, those who on 
their own want to establish contact with intelligence. There was 
a major specialist in electronics who got into debt and decided 
to fix his problem by selling secrets. He came to the county 
where I worked. I met him several blocks away from our embassy 
when he asked me "Could you give me directions to the Soviet 
Embassy?" My mental antennae went up and I tried to engage him 
in conversation. Leaving aside some details, I will only tell 
you that we ended the day in a restaurant; in my pocket was a 
microfiche of a top secret document on antimissile defense, but 
something was bothering me--the amount the foreigner was asking 
for the microcircuits exceeded all permissible standards. The 
Center, however, authorized the deal. We decided not to wait for 
money from Moscow and scraped up this amount by sweeping all our 
foreign representations. 
  [Sedykh] And then what? Did he become a source? 
  [K.] He absolutely refused to cooperate. We approached him 
several times, tried to work with him on the territory of a 
neighboring country--no success. 
  [Sedykh] What about compromising materials? 
  [K.] Which? We are strictly forbidden to use blackmail. 
  [Sedykh] How is your life in retirement now? Are you tempted 
to get into battles again? 
  [K.] I would love to if my health permitted. I ended up with 
a category II disability, however, and cannot work in 
intelligence. So I devote my time to the collection of beer mugs 
I started while abroad. 
  [Sedykh] Then, Boris Petrovich, the way to go for you is to 
join the Beer Lovers Party. 
  "True," the youthful-looking retired spy chuckled.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kiselev: "You Will Learn of Their Fate </F>
from the Order"] 
  [Text] ITAR-TASS has sent a report: reorganization of 
the Armed Forces' mass media has begun. Which is not entirely 
correct. They have simply begun speaking about this at last. But 
the reformers had a different intent. To prepare a draft order 
by the minister of defense without unnecessary fanfare. He would 
sign it hastily without considering it carefully. And the deed 
was done, the reorganization took place. 
  Who needs this? One viewpoint. "We have three 
central organs for the Ministry of Defense--KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the 
weekly SYN OTECHESTVA, the semimonthly journal ARMIYA, and 13 
travel and other magazines. Altogether, 102 editions. At the 
same time, for example, the Pentagon publishes about 400 
magazines and 1,000 newspapers. In the FRG they publish about 
100 military newspapers and magazines, and Britain publishes 
more than 110. A subsidy of 1,241,462,000 rubles [R] is 
required. As a comparison, it costs the state budget roughly 
R1.5 billion to publish just the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA alone." 
(From an interview last year with Vladimir Kosarev, chief of the 
Information and Press Administration of the Ministry of Defense.) 
  The following episode took place last year in one of the MO 
[Ministry of Defense] collegium meetings. "Is a large amount of 
money required to support our press?" the minister asked. They 
answered him. "And how many houses can be built with this?" 
Pavel Grachev asked. "Three or four," the general in charge of 
finances reported. "Well, we should build them," the minister 
sighed. "The housing for officers is really a catastrophe." As 
we know, any sigh by the chief is interpreted as a directive in 
the Army. 
  An arithmetic lesson. Speaking of the need for 
reform, all the military officials say the primary cause is the 
shortage of money (at the same time, though, they prefer to call 
it "optimizing" the press or "putting it in order"), stating 
more specifically that most of the funds go toward the wages of 
editorial staff collectives. The conclusion is obvious--to be 
squeezed. Some of the large-edition publications will really 
disappear soon. This amounts to kopecks, however. You cannot 
shut down the district newspapers. They decided to fill up the 
Ministry of Defense's empty purse at the cost of the Moscow 
editions. Asking that his name not be given, an officer from the 
Information and Press Administration said the finance people 
simply ordered straight out at first: leave only one newspaper 
and one journal. But their ardor was restrained. It looks as if 
only the SYN OTECHESTVA and six magazines are being sent for the 
slaughter in the end. But two new ones are being established (we 
have to pay to order them, by the way). 
  No one could tell me if there is a substantial economic gain 
from such deviations. There are probably no such assessments at 
all. But according to my estimates, it is very questionable. The 
most profitable military publications which are issued regularly 
and are not losing subscribers are on the list of the ones 
curtailed. At the same time, CHEST IMEYU (formerly SOVETSKIY 
VOIN), a literary and artistic journal with excessively inflated 
staffs (55 officers and 63 employees, with 12 correspondents 
stationed in the districts), turned out only six issues last 
year and is up to its ears in debt. The supplement to CHEST 
IMEYU--BOYEVOY TOVARISHCH--has not been issued for a year. 
Aleksey Petrenko, who heads the supplement, implores: "Dismiss 
us in the staff reduction." "No, stay," they respond. 
  Altogether, about 100 officer-journalists are being released 
in the publications being abolished. A few more than the number 
left in the Information and Press Administration. But not many 
more. Even during the times of the unforgettable GlavPUR [Main 
Political Directorate], the octopus which squeezed the Armed 
Forces, the entire military press was headed by a department 
with under 10 soldiers. But now the official category of chief 
of the administration is a lieutenant general, his deputy is a 
major general, and the heads of departments are colonels, who 
are in charge of more colonels. According to my information, the 
administration is staffed by 62 persons. There are 40, according 
to its chief. Although this does not change the point. 
  The prime mover of the reform. When I expressed my 
doubts to one of the administration's employees, he just smiled: 
"Everything runs smoothly as long as our lady is with us." The 
boss of the military press today is Yelena Agapova. The new 
administration--information and press--was established in the 
Ministry of Defense precisely because she asked for it. 
According to Grachev's order, "The chief of the administration 
is subordinate to the Russian Federation minister of defense's 
assistant for public and press relations," that is, to Yelena 
Aleksandrovna. She was formerly the deputy editor in chief of 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Her subordinate, Vladimir Kosarev, who has 
headed the administration and received his general's shoulder 
boards with the speed of lightning, also comes from KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA. 
  And there are no mysteries for military readers with respect 
to CHEST IMEYU. When Nikolay Ivanov no longer wished to head the 
journal after the tragic October, and Aleksandr Tkachev, who 
headed the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA cultural department, took his place, 
Agapova was still a reporter for it. 
  So the encirclement is being reinforced, step by step, "with 
her own people." As General Kosarev explained it to me, his 
administration will decide which publications to shut down and 
whom to appoint as editors of the new ones. They do not even 
intend to consult with the Ministry of Defense collegium about 
the publications being abolished (they include two central 
organs of the Ministry of Defense: SYN OTECHESTVA and ARMIYA, 
the only military-political journal in the Armed Forces). "This 
matter is too minor to divert the collegium's attention." 
  But I know not all the minister's deputies and commanders in 
chief of the service branches are prepared to be content with 
the role of extras.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Novosti-Minus"] </F>
  [Text] The reputation and degree of influence of one 
television company or another are determined by the level and 
quality of its news service. Everything else is added to the 
main dish like an appetizer, a garnish, or a dessert--without 
this the dinner will seem incomplete, but without the main dish 
there will not be any dinner at all. 
  As we know, the quality of news services themselves becomes 
apparent in the difficult and extreme situations--in the ability 
to respond quickly and to provide viewers with full information 
on what is taking place at a given place, at a given hour. 
  During the October events last year, it became clear that 
our 
news is far from being on a par with generally accepted world 
standards. This is not so noticeable in everyday life: well, are 
you sometimes amazed why they begin a program with this event 
and not that one, why they call something amorphous and 
indistinct, and why the anchors who make their appearance in a 
picture are either frivolous and flippant or display an air of 
messianism and importance? Why do they permit themselves to 
engage in lyrical digressions and unconvincing personal 
assessments? 
  The event which took place last week--the release of the 
"Octobrists" from Lefortovo Prison and its airing on various 
channels--once again graphically revealed all the flaws of the 
news services of both the state television companies and the 
clear advantage of the nonstate NTV company by comparison. 
  I cannot help but acknowledge that both "Vesti" and 
"Novosti" 
tried very hard to meet the requirements of the moment and the 
event--they made their own predictions and assessed what had 
taken place themselves. However, one thing was required from the 
news reporters from the beginning: that they show the 
event promptly and reliably, with the details. 
  The NTV "Segodnya" program at 1900 hours on Saturday evening 
began with such coverage. Viewers were able to see the crowd, 
photographed from different points, attending a meeting at the 
walls of the investigation isolation room, the limousines 
arriving for those given amnesty, the departure from the 
casemates of the principal persons concerned in chronological 
order, and Khasbulatov's arrival at his own house. Two groups of 
cameramen stood watch at the prison, which made it possible to 
provide for their maneuverability. We also heard the first 
remarks from those who had been freed. NTV correspondents 
clearly, without emotions and personal assessments, showed and 
reported "What happened? Where? When?" 
  After an hour, "Vesti" rushed on the air. Anchor Tatyana 
Khudobina appeared on the screen, showing by her attitude that 
she was personally outraged by what had taken place. She uttered 
pompous banalities on the subject for several minutes: "We are 
at a loss to understand Russia." The code of the American 
corporation NBC News contains the following rule: "We permit 
those whose experience and sense of responsibility warrants this 
to go beyond the reports on immediate events of the day and to 
evaluate them not in the sense of exhorting or imposing their 
personal opinion, but so that the viewers can receive something 
more than an official statement of facts. If the desire to 
engage in dogmatic expatiation arises, it should be suppressed." 
  Alas, all the so-called commentary by T. Khudobina, as well 
as the commentary by S. Medvedeva in Ostankino's "Novosti," 
consisted of just such expatiations and exhortations, which were 
not "suppressed" by anyone in time. But they were very 
inarticulate on the key event of the day. As an example, "Vesti" 
showed what was taking place at Lefortovo after 15 minutes, and 
at the same time, a correspondent not in the picture was 
duplicating the text of what we saw for ourselves on the screen. 
It is amusing that "Novosti" on the first channel has added the 
word "plus" to its name for the news at 2100 hours on Saturday 
evening. Apparently something similar to "Itogi" had been 
planned. But it turned out to be "Novosti-Minus"--the program 
had everything except a normal account of the news. 
  The next day, which required skillful comprehension of what 
had taken place, one more problem arose: the absence of 
professional commentator-analysts on state television (Nikolay 
Svanidze came out with his "Podrobnosti" [Details] on Monday). 
And once again, only "Itogi" provided a competent analysis of 
the event, the underlying reason for it and the details, and it 
named and presented its well-informed sources to the audience. 
  But "Vesti" and "Novosti" only dropped hints with a 
thoughtful air about certain informed sources--as a rule, those 
whose simple formulation attests to the lack of informants who 
are really well-informed and close to the ruling circles. If the 
reporters for state television cannot obtain information 
firsthand, this means either that the reporters themselves are 
lazy and lack prestige or the ruling structures could not care 
less about them. So they have to make do with hints, innuendos, 
and personal assumptions. So it turns out to be neither news nor 
analysis, but some kind of impossible concoction which makes our 
Western colleagues horrified. Puzzled, they ask: "What are your 
television reporters doing? Is this really possible?" Everything 
is possible here. Continuous "Novosti-Minus." 
  At parliamentary sessions devoted to mass media problems, 
Mikhail Poltoranin, the current head of the Committee on the SMI 
[Mass Media], once again started speaking about "certain 
commercial structures" which are trying with all their might to 
take possession of state television to the detriment of the 
state and the state system. A week earlier, the custodian of the 
dying center of television in St. Petersburg, Bella Kurkova, 
prophesied the same terrible danger. "Is it possible to have 
independent television, bought by the banks?" she asked, with 
her distinctive passion. And she answered herself with the same 
passion: "Never in our lives." 
  Attempts to prove what cannot be proved could be successful 
when we knew no other television but state television. But now, 
when viewers have a choice and the opportunity to compare, 
statements about the mythical threat from commercial television 
seem strange, at least. The appearance on the air of NTV news 
programs, which have won a high rating right away, convince us 
of just the opposite: it is precisely the nonstate news programs 
which are demonstrating a national approach, a high degree of 
social responsibility, competence, and professionalism. All 
arguments such as this are unfounded: "Of course, we can try 
this ourselves for such money, and buy the news sources." The 
viewer does not care at all who bought it, from whom, or for how 
much--just give him the facts, the details. The NTV news 
programs are providing them--and firsthand.

<F P=106> [Open letter "to A.N. Yakovlev and V.V. Lazutkin, Heads of </F>
the Russian Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service" 
from Aleksey Simonov, former cochairman of the former Licensing 
Commission] 
  [Text] 
  Dear Aleksandr Nikolayevich and Valentin Valentinovich! 
  This concerns the licensing of television and radio 
broadcasting, which has been charged to the federal service 
which you head under the president's Edict No. 2255 of 22 
December. 
  The Edict speaks about the preparation of a Statute where 
all 
the questions about licensing are to be explained and published. 
Permit me to ask: Where is this Statute? Why has it not been 
made public? Evidently by force of habit, because these matters 
have always been resolved by the bureaucratic method here. And 
with all my respect and sympathy for you, I have trouble 
believing that it will be your lot to break this "perpetual 
course of heavenly bodies." But the fact that the Statute should 
deal with licensing infringes upon the interests of hundreds of 
nonstate broadcasters (and how it affects them!), and the 
"bureaucratic nature" of decisions in this area may lead all 
these broadcasters who have come into being, those who are 
growing, and those who are becoming independent to the brink of 
ruin. But after all, it is precisely their existence, and only 
it, which actually makes it possible to form an opinion about 
the presence or absence of freedom of information in the 
country; by no means is this a procedure for appointing chiefs 
or a method of editing news reports on state channels. 
  So forgive my persistence, but this concerns implementation 
of the most important article in the Constitution--and nothing 
less. For this reason, I ask that you consider this letter as a 
modest contribution to its protection. 
  For nearly two years I was the cochairman of the Licensing 
Commission (formally, the Interim Broadcasting Commission), and 
my considerations are based on experience which is quite unique, 
for prior to this commission no one was concerned with the 
licensing of radio frequencies in our country. And the only 
available document which you could be guided by in your 
postulates was Council of Ministers Decree No. 500 of 26 
September 1991, in accordance with which the commission was 
formed. 
  So I would like to protect your Statute from this first 
mistake: do not repeat the decree's principal miscalculation and 
reject what is unprecedented in world licensing practice: the 
issuance of two licenses for one frequency--a broadcasting 
license (naturally, the one who broadcasts controls the 
frequency) and a technical license--which ties this frequency to 
a specific transmitter and its owner, which turns out to be an 
enterprise of the Ministry of Communications in 95 out of 100 
cases. Well, what can we compare this with? Imagine that a 
deputy and the technician who provides him with a microphone 
have the same right to address the audience. Meanwhile, it is 
this very provision which has enabled the Ministry of 
Communications to retain its monopoly over the means of 
communication, which in the final analysis led to the shutdown 
of transmitters in dozens of regions in Russia. 
  Secondly, in defining state policy in the field of licensing 
(and this is precisely the purpose of the Statute, obviously), 
you will have to overcome a natural bias toward concern for 
state television and radio to the detriment of nonstate, 
independent, and spontaneous broadcasting. After all, there are 
only two state channels, but there are already hundreds of 
independent broadcasters and, as never before, they need a fair 
law which protects them. Incidentally, from the viewpoint of 
licensing, broadcasting by "Ostankino" and RTV, as paradoxical 
as it may seem, is illegal at present: it has not been legalized 
by a license, unlike many nonstate companies. 
  Thirdly. In its two years of existence, the Licensing 
Commission issued over 250 licenses. In most cases, for five 
years. Will your future Statute confirm them? Or will the new 
broom begin sweeping all over again, increasing the line of 500 
or 600 broadcasters waiting their turn by another 250 because of 
the awkwardness of Decree No. 500 and because of the numerous 
spokes thrust into the wheels of the Licensing Commission by the 
Ministry of Communications? And after all, these 500 are 
broadcasting, but timidly, fearing an administrative outcry or 
arbitrariness, and not only because they are "making 
knucklebones" by any means. Among these "unbridled merchants" 
there are quite a few persons who consider broadcasting their 
duty to the people, to their audience which they have won and 
who have become accustomed to them. And who do not want to learn 
about their city, oblast, republic, and regional news from the 
infrequent mentions in the central channels' reporting. Now, 
when administrative arbitrariness in the regions has intensified 
to such an extent that a license is insufficient protection 
against it, the support of independent radio and television is 
so essential that universal preoccupation exclusively with the 
fate of the two state channels seems to me to be arrogant 
and--excuse me--shortsighted. The unified information space 
which everyone is so concerned about, by the way, does not mean 
that all programs everywhere are tied to the two state 
octopuses, accompanied by state protectionism with respect to 
the 89 small regional octopuses. The unity of this space lies in 
the diversity of choices accessible to the viewer in any part of 
Russia, a diversity supported by a wise law that applies to 
everyone, and a license is the guarantee of adherence to it. 
  The commission in which I worked ordered back in July that 
they remain for a long time. 
  I hope that all the licenses issued since 1 August, and 
quite 
a few have been issued since then, especially by the Ministry of 
Communications, will be nullified by your Statute, for someone 
should put an end to the squandering of state resources. During 
this time the last available ultrahigh frequency [detsimetrovyy] 
television channel in Moscow was pocketed, as well as 
frequencies for which competitions were conducted and there was 
a waiting line, and numerous channels in the regions where the 
Moscow "merchants," waving their new licenses, come looking for 
broadcasters on frequencies they have already obtained by 
circumventing the law. 
  I realize that not everything is within your power, and you 
are unlikely to persuade the president that it is not good to 
give up a state channel with one's own hand, even to such a 
strong team as NTV, without competition and practically without 
serious discussion of the concept of broadcasting. But will the 
Statute contain articles which will help it refrain from such 
actions later on? The Statute, however you write it, is doomed 
to be temporary, for like any limited natural resource, radio 
frequencies need a unified law for their protection. And as I 
recall, there have been no less than five drafts of a law on 
television and radio broadcasting. The last one was prepared in 
those days when the next wave, the Bragin washout, once again 
mixed everything up in the turbulent sea of radio and 
television. Perhaps it should be adopted finally, and the 
Statute on state radio and television should be made one of the 
chapters in this Law, unified for everyone? 
  And finally: will your Statute be able to prevent new 
attempts at blackmail by the Ministry of Communications? When 
the state monopoly sets conditions for the state, is only the 
economy behind this? Incidentally, the wages of ministry's 
employees come not only from payment of the state order to 
transmit the Ostankino or Russian signal. After all, they are 
flaying three independents, or commercial broadcasters, as it is 
more convenient for public consolation to call them, at the same 
time that state authorization is given. The prices are a little 
better than American prices in absolute figures, without any 
references to the exchange rate of hard currency. And there are 
no ministry employees who would not have these extra earnings 
"on the side." It is no coincidence that our commission was 
"dissolved" precisely at the point where it was butted by the 
horns of the ministry's desire not to give the opportunity to 
broadcasters to have their own transmitters and retransmitters. 
Only a strict antimonopoly policy with respect to communications 
enterprises can bring democracy to the situation in radio and 
television broadcasting. Otherwise, everything stays the same: a 
common state knife switch, which the unbridled fanatics at 
Ostankino repeatedly struggle to seize. 
  It has now been two months that I have been trying to 
express 
these and other considerations to you, but in the meantime, for 
old times' sake, people who urgently need the legal right to 
conduct their broadcasting have been arriving from all over 
Russia. And they are telephoning. And they are asking: What 
shall we do? Where do we go? And while previously I was able and 
obliged to respond to this, it is your turn now. And I am 
addressing their questions to you with this letter.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pozdnyakov: "The `Fifth Channel' Has </F>
Received the Right to Control City Radio Broadcasts"] 
  [Text] In her address on one of the broadcasts by St. 
Petersburg Radio, Bella Kurkova, manager of the RGTRK 
[All-Russian State Television and Radio Company] "St. Petersburg 
Fifth Channel," considered the accusations of financial 
violations made against the radio and television company 
management as intrigues by the political opposition and 
announced her intention "to fight them as a journalist is 
supposed to." In her opinion, it is advantageous for the 
national-communist opposition to undermine the authority of a 
major radio and television company on the threshold of elections 
to the City Assembly in order to "damage" the reputation of 
political organizations close to the company's management. 
  According to some reports, after the statement by the 
manager 
of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" the deputy mayor of 
St. Petersburg, Valeriy Malyshev, sent a directive to all rayon 
administrations in the city to eliminate unauthorized 
pre-election broadcasts by rayon radio stations and to 
henceforth coordinate the content of pre-election broadcasts 
with the management of the RGTRK "St. Petersburg Fifth Channel." 
In Mr. Malyshev's opinion, the RGTRK is the only competent 
broadcaster in the entire city, and all the other broadcasters 
(even those registered as mass media) which use the city's radio 
relay network should ask for the consent of its management in 
order to prepare their broadcasts. 
  However, it is possible that the scandals involving the 
RGTRK 
"St. Petersburg Fifth Channel" stem not so much from political 
reasons as commercial reasons. According to certain information, 
the RGTRK management is studying the establishment of of a 
joint-stock company (with the transfer to it of all buildings, 
structures, and equipment of the RGTRK) with the participation 
of the American company "TV and Radio St. Petersburg," which is 
to receive 49 percent of the charter capital of the future AO 
[joint-stock company], and one more TOO [limited liability 
partnership], whose founders are not known at present. The 
documents on establishment of the joint-stock company have been 
passed by the head of the Press and Mass Media Committee of the 
municipal administration, Dmitriy Mezentsev, and they have had 
time to remain on the desk of Vladimir Sumeyko, the press 
minister. Meanwhile, the radio and television company's 
financial activity is attracting more and more interest from law 
enforcement organs. The public prosecutor's office has asked for 
the documents on its transactions with the "TV and Radio St. 
Petersburg Commercial Center" Joint-Stock Company and the 
"Nevskiy Glashatay" AO.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kukanov, St Petersburg: "`Fifth Column' on </F>
Channel Five"] 
  [Text] The hullabaloo raised in connection with corruption 
allegations against the administration of the government 
television and radio company, Peterburg-5y Kanal [Channel 5], 
smacks of a rehearsed performance. At a precisely designated 
hour on 4 March deputies of the state duma -- communist 
Krasnitskiy and liberal democrat Yegorov, who had completed the 
ceremonious act of submitting sensational documents to legal 
protection organs, appeared before television cameras at the 
entrance to the city office of the public prosecutor. The 
essence of the compromising materials was as follows: the 
chairman of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK [State Television and 
Radio Company], Bella Kurkova, gave a large discount to the 
closed joint-stock company, "Kommercheskiy Tsentr TV i Radio 
Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial Center for St Petersburg TV and 
Radio] in exchange for financial aid rendered by the 
aforementioned firm to Kurkova's husband, Vadim Tareyev, 
publisher of the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. He was allegedly 
given 12 million rubles in cash. The general director of the 
firm, V. Mikhaylov, informed the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia] deputy to the state duma, V. Marychev, of this two 
days prior to the aforementioned ceremony. 
  Events occurred in the following manner. Some time ago, 
Mikhail Syroyezhin, deputy chairman for commercial questions of 
Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK, did make a proposal regarding 
sponsorship to the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. The 
corresponding contract was signed on 16 February by Mikhaylov 
and Tareyev. Incidentally, the document cites 15 February 1994 
as its expiration date. The document was obviously prepared in 
such haste that not a single signatory found time to read the 
typed text with the typographical error. 
  The one-year agreement concerning joint advertising 
operations with Mikhaylov's firm was signed on 23 February by 
Siroyezhin. While having the right to decide such questions 
unilaterally, he nevertheless brought the document to Kurkova, 
who also signed it the following day. The contract concerned 120 
minutes per month of advertising on St Petersburg television and 
a 35-percent discount on the total cost of materials placed. 
  On 22 February Mikhaylov gave Tareyev 12 million rubles -- 
the first sponsor contribution. He explained that he borrowed 
this money from his friend Nikita Arkhipov, who not long before 
the events being described was invited by Syroyezhin to be 
director of the joint commercial center of St Petersburg TV. 
Thus, he said, accept the cash. This is how Mikhaylov portrays 
events in his report of Mr. Marychev. Actually things went a 
little differently. Syroyezhin gave the money to Tareyev, and 
not on 22 February but on 25 February, Friday. Few people paid 
attention to this discrepancy in dates, and as we will see 
further, that was a mistake. 
  One must be a very naive person and not understand anything 
about commerce to take 12 million rubles in a plastic bag 
without witnesses, without even looking at the bills (what if 
they were counterfeit), carry them through town to the editorial 
offices and lock them in a safe because the work day was over 
and all banks were already closed. The editor of NEVSKIY 
GLASHATAY is precisely this kind of person. This was confirmed 
unanimously by people who have known him for a while. 
  Bella Kurkova insists that she learned about the sponsorship 
contract with NEVSKIY GLASHATAY only when the scandal broke. But 
these are words which, as we know, do not correspond to the 
facts. The financial and commercial affairs of Peterburg-5y 
Kanal GTRK are being examined by a management control commission 
of the president's administration, sent from Moscow today. 
Incidentally, this type of examination had been planned, but the 
fuss surrounding St Petersburg's TV accelerated the 
disembarkation on the banks of the Neva of a landing party of 
inspectors from the capital. They should have at the same time 
questioned some participants in this story in order to receive 
first-hand information. But here some curious circumstances 
arise. 
  Mikhaylov has disappeared. Moreover, his firm is nowhere to 
be found. The Petrograd District administration cannot confirm 
that his commercial structure was registered -- there is no data 
about it in the computer. It is unknown where, by whom and when 
Mr. Mikhaylov's enterprise was registered. 
  There is more. Three days before the transfer of the 12 
million to the NEVSKIY GLASHATAY, Arkhipov, the director of the 
OKTs [Joint Commercial Center] of St Petersburg TV was fired 
unexpectedly. Telephone calls to his home reveal that he is 
somewhere abroad and it is not clear when he will return. 
  Finally, Kurkova's deputy, Syroyezhin, who handed her 
husband 
the money on Friday, 25 February, went to Moscow on business on 
28 February and has also disappeared. Several days prior to his 
departure he attempted to obtain a visa to the U.S. through the 
international division of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK for his 
wife, who worked for him at the television station. He was 
unsuccessful in obtaining the visa, but Siroyezhin's wife 
disappeared from the city, and from that time no one in St 
Petersburg has seen him either. It is true that two people at 
least heard from him. 
  Bella Kurkova, who categorically refuses to comment to SMI 
[mass media], nevertheless submitted a number of documents to 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. A business note by V. Nechayev, director of 
the joint information service of Peterburg-5y Kanal, states: 
  "On 2 March at about 8 p.m. I received a call from M. 
Syroyezhin, who told me that he was calling from Moscow, that he 
had been involved in an incident, that he had been attacked, 
that it had been said he was in `shock' and was in the hospital 
to recover. `If anyone organized this, it was someone from Most 
Bank,' said M. Syroyezhin. It's too bad B. Kurkova is quarreling 
with Most Bank (let me remind you that in one of the broadcasts, 
entitled `On the Political Olympus,' which aired on RTV [Russian 
TV] following the well-known October events, eyewitnesses told 
Kurkova that the thugs bypassed the floors occupied by this 
commercial structure). Nevzorov was also discussed, and M. 
Syroyezhin said that Nevzorov also has his sights on St 
Petersburg television." 
  From the work notes of S. Karatayev, director of the 
international service of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK: 
  "On the evening of 10 March M. I. Syroyezhin called me and 
said that he was in Austria and in the hospital because of liver 
damage. In Moscow a gang of people unknown to him had attacked 
and beaten him, taking the documents that he carried. After 
this, being in shock from his injuries, he travelled to Austria, 
where he learned that an abnormal situation had developed 
surrounding his name. He told me that he would like to return to 
work at the TV station but that first he would have to know 
exactly what he was being blamed for. He asked me to talk to B. 
Kurkova so that she would explain everything about the guilt of 
M. Syroyezhin. He reported that very high authorities about whom 
we do not know are interested in firing Kurkova, and that he is 
a `small' person who wants a normal and quiet life." 
  Mr. Syroyezhin has not yet appeared on the banks of the 
Neva. 
The company's management has turned to the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service and the St Petersburg and oblast 
GUVD [Main Administration for Internal Affairs] with a request 
to take measures to find him. All of this is like a bad dream. 
We have the feeling we have already seen it before. Yes, of 
course, the "white house," the vice president with compromising 
briefcases, the secret disappearance of Yakubovskiy...It looks 
like an old scenario was suitable for this time too. It is true 
that it is a play on a different scale and on a different stage. 
This point of view is shared by Aleksandr Semikolennyy, the 
director of the group of inspectors from the president's 
administration. In a conversation with me, without anticipating 
the results of the investigation, which in all likelihood will 
not conclude earlier than next week, he called the Channel 5 
scandal a preplanned political provocation. In his opinion, no 
criminality regarding advertising discounts will be upheld, 
because this is practiced on domestic TV right and left. The 
television company should just have been more selective in 
choosing partners for cooperation in the commercial arena. 
  B. Kurkova says that Mikhail Syroyezhin's appearance on 
television did not arouse the slightest bit of suspicion in the 
company's administration, since he had a fair reputation in 
business circles. In additio,n he is the son of the deceased 
Ivan Syroyezhin, well-known in our country and abroad as a 
scientist-economist who participated actively in Leningrad TV 
programs. 
  These are the main participants and perpetrators of the 
scandal, which naturally has an underlying political basis. 
There was no point to Mr. Marychev's assurances at a recent 
Moscow press conference on the Channel 5 situation that the 
actions of the duma deputies have the completely beneficial 
purpose of fighting corruption. To a person who knows the habits 
of the representative of St Petersburg's liberal democrats in 
the state duma it is very difficult to believe in the sincerity 
of such pronouncements. Recently, for example, he wished to 
appear on television in order to campaign for the LDPR before 
elections to the city assembly. Having received a negative reply 
for the reason that not a single one of the 16 election blocks 
will have this opportunity during the pre-election campaign, 
Marychev declared that Kurkova should not forget about the empty 
rooms in Lefortovo prison. 
  Simultaneously with the heated scandal, Nevzorov restated 
his 
demand to put "600 Seconds" back on the air. On the initiative 
of the city office of the public prosecutor, his work was 
subject to expert analysis in the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
where Nevzorov himself is an honorary member. The academicians 
found no evidence in his program of calls toward violent action, 
of fascist propaganda or of other illegalities. On this basis 
Nevzorov demanded to be put on the air and people carrying red 
flags and portraits of Stalin moved toward the television 
station. 
  However, all of this is just surface scandal. There are 
other 
facts that are hardly known to most people. On 25 February (the 
day of the transfer of money to Kurkova's husband and the eve of 
the mysterious disappearance of Syroyezhin) a fax arrived at 
Chapygina 6 from the director of the Arkhangelsk Joint Radio and 
Television Transmission Center with a request to give 
communications workers the right to broadcast in exchange for 
canceling all debts of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK. After this, 
similar dispatches arrived from Kaluga, Ulyanovsk, 
Yekaterinburg, Yaroslavl, Zlatoust, Belgorod, Rybinsk and Tula. 
All of them stated the same thing, as if they were xeroxed 
copies of each other. B. Kurkova feels that the scandalously 
blank television screens in Russia this winter were not the 
result of a strike by communications workers, but a 
demonstration of the power of big money, of the intentions of 
powerful commercial structures to buy government television. 
  If Ostankino and RTV are not accessible to some today, they 
can try to get the third largest state television company, that 
of St Petersburg, the programs of which are transmitted by 300 
transmitters to 80 million people. Considering the fact that 
presidential elections are not far off, someone is already 
examining the situation and pulling the strings. 
  Who? I do not have the answer to this question. B. Kurkova 
says that she knows the names of people who will attest that 
Mikhail Syroyezhin has certain ties with many representatives of 
the party's "armed detachment," which is very displeased with 
the changes in the country. 
  Mikhail Molostvov, deputy of the state duma from Saint 
Petersburg, and writers Daniil Granin, Aleksandr Volodin, Yakov 
Gordin, Nina Katerli and Boris Strugatrskiy have sent an open 
letter to the RF president, in which they ask him to turn his 
attention to the Channel 5 situation and to have the Russian 
General Office of the Public Prosecutor take this matter under 
strictest control. I feel there is an urgent need to do this.

sciences: "The Authorities Themselves are Interested in the 
Existence of Organized Crime: State-Mafiosi Relationships Have 
Become a Way of Life in Russia"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Opinion </H5>
  Organized crime and corruption as a principally new social 
phenomenon (in contrast to the elementary or traditional crime 
and the numerous abuses of officialdom since time immemorial) 
appeared in the country approximately in the mid 1960's-early 
1970's in the form of a powerful alliance that set in between 
criminals in the economic sphere, leaders of the criminal world, 
and representatives of the bureaucratic apparatus at all levels. 
Which also guaranteed criminals protection from any form of 
social control, including on the part of law enforcement organs. 
Individual major scandalous trials of that period (for example, 
trade, fishing, Sochi) only created the illusion of an 
uncompromising attitude on the part of the authorities in the 
protection of legality. But in fact this was a reaction to a 
violation of the rules of the game established in the higher 
strata of society, and had nothing in common with the law and 
the morality that was being propagandized. 
  Gathering strength, organized crime began to monopolize all 
spheres of unlawful and asocial activity that secure material 
profit. Like any social, managerial structure, it developed in 
the form of a pyramid, including lower levels of "unskilled 
labor" and "bureaucratic" strata that ensured the efficiency of 
the system and its security, and also its ideologically ruling 
elite. 
  An economic analysis of the financial-economic activity of 
some Soviet republics conducted at the end of the 1980's by 
specialists indicated that the volume of shadow turnover in them 
increased their budgets. Actually, this indicated the full 
criminalization of social relations in them. Risking being 
accused of inciting national discord and offending national 
feelings, I will not name specific regions, although in some of 
them the present rulers have already become hostage to the 
interests of mafiosi clans. 
  What has been said is quite sufficient to answer the 
question 
that was raised. The authorities themselves turned out to be 
interested in the existence of organized crime and in the 
corruption that was imminently inherent in it. 
  One of the main reasons for the offensive development of 
organized crime is that it was the only truly market structure 
in the state under any conditions, which also enabled it in all 
periods to quickly (in a mobile way) adapt itself to changes. 
And not simply adapt itself, but at the same time derive the 
maximum material and political advantages. The country's entry 
into market relations opened up unprecedented prospects for our 
mafia. In contrast to other countries, where organized crime 
developed in an underground market of commodity and service 
shortages, our mafia, protected together with its highly placed 
official patrons from any forms of control (including the law 
enforcement system), in recent years unpardonably, with forceful 
methods, also took legal forms of entrepreneurship under its 
control. 
  State-mafiosi relations are becoming a way of life of 
today's 
authorities, who, together with the leaders of the criminal 
world, determine economic and political realities. Although why 
today's? After all, we see in the offices of power the very same 
persons we saw 10 years ago. But the new "lucky ones," who made 
their way through to the distribution of the property and 
authority pie regardless of their political attachment, in a 
majority of cases accepted the standing rules of the game which 
assure them numerous personal benefits. 
  At the present time the mafia is already monopolizing 
virtually all directions of legal business that bring in 
super-profits, not counting the traditional underground 
directions. 
  Therefore: 
  --it is not accidental that it is by no means the producers 
of goods who receive quota, license, customs, tax, and other 
privileges, but those who are accustomed to living in the 
corridors of power; 
  --it is not surprising that the militia is being equipped 
with technical means with the active participation of the mafia 
and through the mediation of the authorities (naturally, not 
without profit for the latter); 
  --it is quite natural that the law enforcement organs are 
now 
already guarding not only the representatives of authority but 
also the mafiosi structures against all accusations; 
  --it is natural that the popularity and social rating of the 
leaders of organized crime is growing, and they continuously 
appear on television as "patrons" and "philanthropists." 
  Under similar conditions, the creation of numerous new 
controlling organs (in the fight against corruption and 
organized crime, for control over the issuance of licenses and 
granting privileges to entrepreneurial structures, and in the 
fight against abuses in the division of property, etc.)--is 
nothing more than a valve for an apparatus that is unfit for use 
to let off the steam of civil dissatisfaction. This is only the 
emergence of new stillborn bureaucratic structures, whose 
burdensome maintenance is laid on the taxpayer. 
  Can there be any serious talk about branches of authority 
that will be able to oppose organized crime and corruption? 
  As a rule, the mafia does not give a damn about the numerous 
exposures in the mass media--is this authority? 
  The court, which remains hostage to local and higher 
authorities, is intimidated and being bought by the mafia--is 
this authority? 
  The legislator, who out of poverty begins work to resolve 
his 
own material interests and wonders whether he will be shot in 
the event of a dispute with another "branch"--is this authority? 
  It is simply stupid to rely on the law enforcement organs. 
In 
addition to the fact that these organs themselves are corroding 
more and more from contact with the enemy, they cannot 
objectively--no matter how much they wish to--get into the game 
outside the boundaries of the established rules. It is 
characteristic that their leaders reduce the task of confronting 
a dangerous phenomenon in a majority of cases to a fight against 
trivial bandit groups that constitute, undoubtedly, an extremely 
important element, but only the lower executive element of the 
global structure of organized crime. The key is simple: Today 
this is the limit of the capabilities of the law enforcement 
organs. At the same time, an overwhelming majority of registered 
murders are not solved, inasmuch as in a number of cases this 
would lead to scandals at a rather high level. 
  An alarming symptom: To effectively fight the mafia, some 
people are demanding extreme measures and the assignment of 
additional powers to special subunits. This is the wrong path, 
which is, in fact, the recidivist psychology of communist 
lawlessness and terrorism and which has shameful examples in the 
form of "extraordinary commissions." New lawlessness is capable 
of giving rise only to lawlessness with numerous abuses and a 
protective reaction that is difficult to predict. 
  Also absurd are the numerous hopes for toughening the 
criminal sector in legislation. This is just another myth. And 
the existing criminal law makes it possible more effectively to 
oppose organized crime and corruption. Therefore, the problem 
today lies not in its toughening (although undoubtedly a whole 
series of categories of crimes resulting from specific market 
relations should be introduced immediately), but in the 
capability to employ it without being afraid of invading the 
sphere of interests of the powers that be. 
  Is the mafia longing to gain power? Undoubtedly. But it 
would 
be naive to think that the "godfathers themselves" are burning 
with desire to occupy key posts in the power structures, thereby 
assuming responsibility for the political, economic, and social 
situation in the country, and are staking their well-being on 
this. The modest role of stage manager is quite enough for them. 
And they are handling this role successfully. 
  Our Russian mafia can really do everything. Apparently, 
someone still remembers that in 1988 the USSR officially put 
forth its candidacy to conduct the Olympic Games in the year 
2000...in the Black Sea city resort of Sochi. Organized crime 
was behind this. Just the fact of the promotion was quite enough 
for the conduct of large-scale machinations in real estate. 
  A whole series of events that occurred in Russia in the last 
year characterize for me occurrences of this order: 
  For example: 
  --the exchange of money, as a result of which only poor 
people suffered. On the other hand, thousands of commercial 
structures appeared in the sphere of control of organized crime 
which to this day exchange tens and hundreds of billions of 
Soviet bills for rubles of the new type with unquestionable 
profit for the mafia; 
  --the decision to allocate $500 million for the construction 
of a new parliamentary center in Moscow, as a result of which 
not only does the new parliament compromise itself immediately 
(in any case), but a substantial amount of hard currency that is 
released for nontraditional construction will be stolen; 
  --the collapse of the ruble in January of this year, on 
which 
quite a few persons multiplied their fortunes in several days. 
  There they are--real signs of the activity of organized 
crime, quite remote from banal bandit formations. 
  But who will fight against this?

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Panarin, candidate of historical </F>
sciences: "Our People Among Strangers. Russians in the Near 
Abroad"] 
  [Text] Much has already been said about the fate of 
Russians living in the near abroad. At the same time a certain 
one-sidedness has been characteristic of the reasoning on this 
subject: the overseas Russians themselves and the peoples 
surrounding them are not usually seen as the characters of 
history on whose behavior this solution of the "Russian 
question" or the other will depend. There is not, accordingly, 
all that much interest in the capacity of either for independent 
action, and their mutual relations and aspirations are touched 
on only in passing. 
<H5>  Weakness of the Strong </H5>
  In 1989 Central Asia had a population of 49 million persons. 
Russians accounted for almost 20 percent, or 9.5 million of 
them. In terms of absolute numbers, Russians were spread within 
the region as follows: 6.2 million of them in Kazakhstan, over 
1.6 million in Uzbekistan, 900,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 380,000 in 
Tajikistan, and 330,000 in Turkmenistan. In terms of the 
proportion of Russians in the population, the order is somewhat 
different: Kazakhstan 38 percent, Kyrgyzstan, 21 percent, 
Turkmenistan, over 9, and Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, 
approximately 8 percent. 
  Proceeding from these figures, Russians represent quite a 
sizable force. Especially since they are employed mainly in 
industry, construction, and transport. There are among them many 
first-class specialists, and their labor creates a proportion of 
the national income notably in excess of their proportion of the 
population. But the Russians' political importance far from 
corresponds to their numbers, educational level, and economic 
role. It is possible to speak confidently even about their 
political weakness. 
  To understand the point at issue here, it is necessary to 
once again resort to figures. In 1989 from 52 to 57 percent of 
Russians in the republics of the region, or approximately 5 
million persons, were first-generation immigrants. Of these, 
only 1.5 million had lived in Central Asia for over 10 years. 
The proportion of persons fluent in the language of the titular 
nation was among Russians negligible: from 1 percent in 
Kazakhstan to 4.5 percent in Uzbekistan. 
  Central Asia's Russians are weak for the added reason that 
they do not form communities which are really cohesive on the 
inside. All too often were they shaken up and shuffled about by 
the Soviet authorities. They are socially disconnected, they 
have not generated their own traditions, and they have no 
experience of joint struggle for their rights and interests. 
  Russians' adaptation to the new situation is complicated by 
their milieu also. It is oppressing the Russians and pushing 
them out. There is much in this pressure that is 
unpremeditatedly transient. But people usually judge the future 
by what the present is like. And it is not inspiring. It is not 
even a question of economic difficulties and the slump in the 
industries in which Russians are employed or the everyday 
manifestations of nationalism. Russians are prepared to put up 
with all this. When they leave the region, it is other factors 
that are of decisive significance. 
  First factor. A new role appeared for Russians 
with the proclamation of independence. Inasmuch as a whole 
number of support structures of the new statehood may be 
supported only by them as yet (the energy complex, defense 
industry, the borders, technological continuity), the viability 
of the states of the region and, with it, the stability of 
national power, essentially depend on the Russians. The 
politicized groups of the indigenous population understand this 
full well. But they see the stabilizing role of the Russians 
both as a good thing and as an evil--a threat to their plans for 
the building of strong states of the titular nations. And they 
calculate: Lest we in time come up against the Russians' 
organized resistance to state nationalism, it is not enough 
preventing them from creating their own parties. It is necessary 
in addition by way of preemption to close all potential schools 
of solidarity. Consequently, no "Russian communities," "Russian 
universities," and so forth. 
  Second factor. Actual policy in the region is not 
European, and not even Russian. Underlying it is the struggle 
between local-cultural communities (journalists have christened 
them "clans") for power and resources. It is not aimed 
especially against Russians; nonetheless, it excludes them from 
unofficial policy simply automatically, on account of their 
being "nontitular." And at this time the power structures are 
quietly being "purged" of Russians within the framework of 
official policy. There is just one outcome: In the face of 
rivals, Russians are left without connections, allies, or 
sponsors, in the face of the authorities, without the means to 
block unacceptable decisions. This is engendering in the 
Russians a sense of a lack of political protection and 
discrimination, and it cannot be dispelled either by formal 
legislative guarantees of equality or by reassuring statements 
of presidents. 
  Third factor. Each new state of the region and the 
region as whole have not achieved genuine political stability. A 
modern political culture is far from developed here. Titular 
nations have not been formed completely, and they have 
long-standing claims on one another. Despite the ostensible 
splendor, not all is operating smoothly in interstate relations, 
either. Together with the growth of the political nationalism of 
the titular nations, an increase in the attraction of the 
indigenous population to Islam--a religion disposed toward 
active interference in policy--has also emerged in recent years. 
The influx into the cities of rural youth with a low educational 
level has increased. It is seeking for itself a place in the 
sun--but the place has been taken by Russians! As the experience 
of the Third World has shown, it is among the socially 
unsuccessful young migrants that xenophobia rapidly develops and 
the propaganda of "simple" solutions to complex problems finds a 
response. All this is making Central Asia a place of the 
dangerous concentration of possible conflicts. And recollections 
of what these conflicts might be like are still fresh: the 
conflagrations in Fergana, the Osh beatings, the blood, plunder, 
and devastation in Tajikistan.... When stability is real, 
representatives of the minority, thinking of the future, may be 
guided by sober calculation. When it is only apparent, rational 
considerations frequently give way in the face of a fit of 
emotion and an endeavor to save oneself, not counting personal 
cost, from the oppressive threat of violence. 
<H5>  Security Is Not Guaranteed </H5>
  It is obvious from what has been said that Russians are 
making their continued stay in the region dependent on how the 
problem of their security is resolved. Three aspects of security 
are for them most important of all here: cultural security, 
political security, and physical security. If they are 
guaranteed, the majority of Russians will remain where they are. 
Russians are united as yet mainly by objective similarity of 
situation, and they are seeking not so much joint (group) 
security as personal (individual) security. The best evidence of 
this is their behavior: they are acting like people deprived of 
collective support, and each is relying on himself. And the 
Russians are primarily walking away from conflict situations. 
This, incidentally, is one of the main reasons why there have as 
yet been no bloody clashes between Russians and representatives 
of the titular nations in Central Asia. 
  But the Russians are leaving. And no difficulties are 
stopping them. Even though the prices of Russians' apartments 
have fallen and hosts of bribe-takers are swarming all over the 
emigrants, even though things are difficult in Russia with 
regard to accommodations and jobs, Russians keep on coming. It 
has to be acknowledged that the masses of Russians have decided 
that they have no way of achieving personal security other than 
by making their way to Russia. 
  Is the assertion of a mass departure justified, however? 
Here 
are figures for Tajikistan: Since the start of 1989 through the 
end of 1993, the Russian population declined fourfold. Some 
85,000-100,000, the majority of whom are simply not in a 
position to leave--they have no money--have remained. Of course, 
the flight of Russians from Tajikistan was provoked to a large 
extent by the civil war. But let us take neighboring Kyrgyzstan, 
where political stability has been maintained thus far and 
where, incidentally, the sole Slav university throughout the 
region has been inaugurated. In 1989 the net migration exodus of 
Russians was 2,200 persons, in 1990, 16,300, in 1991, 17,400, in 
1992, 48,500, and in nine months of 1993, almost 60,000. In five 
years the Russian minority has "thinned" by 20 percent, and the 
average annual growth of the migration wave in 1990-1993 (after 
it had suddenly soared, that is) was 170 percent! If this trend 
continues even in a modified form, there will by the end of the 
century be no Russians left in Kyrgyzstan at all. 
  So, according to the most guarded calculations, there are no 
longer 9.5 million Russians in Central Asia but 8-8.5 million. 
The rate of their departure is accelerating. Russians can still 
adapt, their exodus may yet be halted. But support from outside 
and a policy of protection on the part of Russia are needed for 
this. Will such a policy be pursued? 
  High officials declared recently that Russia would 
henceforward take advantage of its position of donor for the 
protection of Russians in Central Asia. The question of dual 
citizenship was raised also (and has with Turkmenistan already 
been settled). In short, Russia has openly proclaimed a policy 
of the protection of "compatriots" and indicated that it will 
pursue it economically and by legal means. 
  The adoption of this policy signifies a partial 
identification of Russia's national interests with the ethnic 
interests of the minority which lives outside it and which, in 
accordance with all international rules of law, comes under the 
all-embracing (albeit not unconditional) jurisdiction of other 
states. A real danger of Russia's infringement of its neighbors' 
sovereignty arises. And the main grounds for this is the archaic 
"common blood" principle, which is rejected by civilized policy. 
  Such an approach will hardly win the support of the 
international community. It is risky from the viewpoint of 
regional security also. The Moscow-Kiev-Almaty triangle contains 
the main potential for stability or instability for the entire 
former USSR and the geopolitical space adjoining the CIS. 
Relations with Ukraine have long left much to be desired. But 
the Kazakhstan leg has not, it would seem, been cause for 
concern. But Russia's insertion on the political agenda of 
"compatriots" as a central problem has already shown that this 
is fraught with complications in relations with Kazakhstan. 
  Nonetheless, the policy of the protection of Russians cannot 
be rejected out of hand merely on the grounds that it is not 
defended by legal precedent or that it threatens to harm 
Russia's relations with its southern neighbors. The problems 
bequeathed Russia by the unique state of the USSR are frequently 
without precedent also. So they need to be resolved by us 
conforming to their essence, to the Soviet historical legacy 
embodied in them, not merely to fine world standards. Further, 
since the millions of citizens of Russia who voted for 
Zhirinovskiy are making of paramount importance the security of 
"their," Russian, community (rather the security of national 
prestige, even), it is impossible to continue to pursue as 
though nothing has happened a policy with the emphasis only on 
the security of the individual. The main thing is that the 
problem of the Central Asian Russians really does confront 
Russia and that the latter must resolve it. 
<H5>  The Fourth Path </H5>
  Four paths are theoretically open to the Central Asian 
Russians: dissolution in the majority (assimilation), return to 
Russia (repatriation), separation or the acquisition of 
territorial autonomy (sovereignization), and organic inclusion 
in the local society with preservation of their ethno-cultural 
distinctiveness (incorporation). With assimilation, the need for 
protection evaporates. With repatriation, protection is 
necessary, but only for the period of immigration. It is far 
more important to create for the immigrants human conditions in 
Russia. But it is in this sphere that concern for the 
"compatriots" is being displayed most niggardly. An emphasis on 
sovereignization could lead to open and acute conflicts. 
Considering what has already been said about the Russian 
minority, it is doubtful that it would anywhere achieve 
sovereignization with the purely political support of Russia. 
The sovereignization of the Russians is entirely unacceptable to 
the local political elites, and for the majority of the 
indigenous population also, evidently. Resistance to such 
attempts would be bitter. But then the main role in the 
protection of Russians would revert to military means, and there 
would no longer be either personal or group or regional security. 
  There remains only the fourth path, whereby economic and 
legal means of protection are expedient and paramount--the path 
of incorporation. Judging by everything, Russia intends on the 
one hand to push onto it those being protected and, on the 
other, to constrain its CIS partners to clear this path of 
various obstacles. But here is the problem: economic and legal 
protection are painfully different in terms of anticipated 
effect. 
  The positive effect of economic protection could be 
considerable. In the event of Russia's skillful use of this 
lever, the governments of the countries of the region would 
agree to grant Russians real guarantees of cultural autonomy. 
There would be a great probability also of an easing of the 
hidden discrimination against Russians. It would all depend here 
on whether the Russians themselves could forgo the habits of a 
client and the ways of an "elder brother," and whether there 
would be the disappearance in the titular nations of the 
suspicions that the Russians want not so much incorporation as 
isolation and that they are pining for their former, exclusive 
status and could for this reason be a fifth column, the conduits 
of imperial designs, and so forth. 
  A few words about legal protection. Dual-citizenship 
agreements would make it a legitimate component of interstate 
relations, which is very important for Russia. But they are, 
strictly speaking, important for Russians only inasmuch as they 
facilitate departure for Russia. Legal protection would do 
little to help consolidate the Russian minority and its 
cohesion, however, and could even hinder it. 
  As a whole, whatever accents Russian policy adopts, its 
results will depend, all the same, on the behavioral responses 
of Russians and the indigenous population, which is relatively 
impervious to its influence. This does not mean that a policy of 
protection is not needed at all. It is simply that it is not 
possible to expect much. It would most likely stimulate not 
incorporation, but a gradual exodus to Russia. It would at best 
postpone the leave-taking of Central Asia of the majority of 
Russians who live there (this would be its dubious, albeit 
modest, success), but would under no circumstances put it off 
far into the 21st century.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Juridical Sciences Nikolay </F>
Postovoy: "Not a Defendant Before the Voter"] 
  [Text] The Institute of Legislation and Comparative 
Jurisprudence discussed a scientific research plan, which 
defines the concept of development of Russia's legislation, and 
the new problems arising with the refinement of the status of a 
deputy of the Federal Assembly. 
  A very sharp debate was held during the discussion of the 
question concerning the status of a deputy. It brought to light 
the problematic nature of the previously existing imperative 
mandate of a deputy in connection with the adoption of the new 
Constitution. Whereas previously the content of the imperative 
mandate included such elements as the report of a deputy to 
voters, instructions from voters, and the recall of a deputy, 
the Constitution adopted at the referendum rejected all this. 
  Some scientists and deputies believe that the resolution of 
this task can be found in the adoption of laws regulating the 
activity of deputies, while others assume that it is impossible 
to do this, because it is a matter of questions, which are the 
subject of regulation of the Constitution alone. Very likely, 
any of these points of view has the right to existence. 
  The novelty of the suffrage lies in the fact that part of 
the 
deputies of the State Duma are elected in the all-federal 
district from parties and public associations. Who should give 
instructions to deputies and to whom should they report? Should 
all Russia be included in this process, or should such measures 
be implemented in individual territories? How should innovations 
be viewed from the standpoint of citizens' equal rights and 
political stability? The same concerns the problem of the recall 
of deputies elected from the all-federal district. 
  Thus, the imperative mandate affirmed by the laws of past 
years has disappeared together with the old structure of the 
legislative body. It was replaced by the free mandate, which 
denies the legal and other responsibility of a deputy to voters. 
In the opinion of Prof. V.I. Vasilyev, this means that a deputy 
is not bound by instructions from voters and acts in the 
parliament in accordance with his ideas of what is proper and 
his own conscience. 
  However, even with this the possibilities of a certain 
influence on deputies remain. It is easier to accomplish this 
task with regard to deputies elected on the basis of party 
lists. The party, being interested in enhancing its prestige, 
can exert an influence on its deputies through fractions in the 
parliament by making demands in accordance with party 
discipline. Furthermore, it can warn a deputy about not 
including him in the lists of candidates for the next elections. 
  Concerning contacts between deputies and voters it was 
stated 
unequivocally: We must have such a norm in the law. Its 
importance is due to the fact that deputies, communicating with 
voters, will know real life processes to a greater extent and 
will be able to take into account the entire spectrum of public 
opinion during the drafting and adoption of legislative acts. 
Moreover, this will make it possible to overcome the gap among 
various social strata and central authorities. 
  The question of deputies' control functions is no less 
problematic. The Constitution does not provide for such powers 
for deputies. Now they do not have the right to independently 
check enterprises, institutions, and organizations, as was the 
case earlier. Long-term experience has shown the uselessness of 
such an activity. 
  In connection with this the following question arises: Does 
the parliament itself have such a function? Yes, it follows from 
a number of articles of the Constitution. This is expressed in 
the following: 
  --in the right of the chambers to establish bodies for 
control over the fulfillment of the budget and a special 
commission for the preparation of a conclusion on the removal of 
the president from office; 
  --in the right of control over the implementation of 
personnel policy by the president. Both the Council of the 
Federation and the State Duma have levers of effect on personnel 
policy; 
  --in the right of control over the president's activity in 
the area of foreign policy through the adoption of the law on 
the ratification or denunciation of international treaties; 
  --in the right of the Council of the Federation to approve 
or 
not to approve the president's edicts on the imposition of 
martial law and a state of emergency. 
  The parliament's control functions could also find their 
expression in the form of systematic meetings by government 
members with parliament members. During questions and answers, 
which occur naturally in this process, it is always possible to 
isolate the basic tendencies in the government course and to 
give them the appropriate evaluation. 
  It is impossible not to touch upon the course of discussion 
of the question concerning citizens' responsibility for the 
violation of the rights of deputies and their family members. 
The final opinion was reduced to the fact that legal norms 
should be applied to an equal degree and in the same manner to 
all citizens when they commit wrongful acts against whomever it 
may be. They cannot be toughened or softened on the basis of the 
post or the position held. 
  Otherwise, elements of discrimination against citizens' 
rights will arise inevitably.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Iosifovich Resin, first deputy </F>
chairman of the Moscow Government, by TRUD correspondent Yuriy 
Ursov: "Vladimir Resin: `We Are Not Building for the Nouveau 
Riche'"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] The first deputy chairman of the Moscow 
Government, Vladimir Iosifovich Resin, is well known not just in 
the capital; in addition to Russia's builders, he is also known 
by people, most likely, in many governments -- in the former 
republics of the USSR. The reason for this is worth seeking in 
Vladimir Resin's work history, which is associated with work in 
Ukraine, Armenia, the Arctic and Siberia. And in the fact that 
Moscow's builders have always been in the public eye, using the 
most advanced technologies of civil construction. 
  Some consider Resin, who has spent nearly 30 years on 
erecting new buildings, to be a person who is one of Russia's 10 
most influential people, while others try to discern in him the 
features of a "moss-covered" conservative party member. But, 
both critics and well-wishers agree on one thing -- the chief 
Moscow builder possesses a high level of professionalism. How is 
a professional supposed to work under the conditions of economic 
instability? How are Moscow builders living today? Vladimir 
Resin reflects on this in a conversation with a TRUD 
correspondent. 
  [Ursov] Vladimir Iosifovich, in my opinion, you could easily 
be retrained as a specialist on the history of domestic 
construction. 
  [Resin] I think is is a bit early to make me into a 
chronical-writing patriarch. If only because I firmly believe 
that the history and the best traditions of Russian and Moscow 
builders are far from finished, even though we are experiencing 
times which are not the best. I began as a mining foreman in 
Ukraine and worked at large industrial construction projects in 
the Arctic and in many other regions, until I was transferred in 
1965 to Moscow, my native city. So I had plenty of opportunities 
to study construction under the administrative-command system. 
  Then builders were always the last in line. Considered 
valuable were the skill to "dislodge" resources from Gosplan 
[State Planning Committee], a loud voice and the ability to 
"berate" subordinates at a work-progress meeting. But there was 
also another thing: participation in the construction of the 
most complicated technological complexes forged the highest 
level of professionalism, while working under the most difficult 
conditions taught them to find a common language with people and 
to organize them, managing collectives which were extremely 
complex in their composition. It is likely that this is why we, 
figuratively speaking, the "directors of the sixties," easily 
converse with one another, understanding our conversation 
partner's meaning at once. And conversely: I stumble on some 
misunderstanding while communicating with undoubtedly gifted 
economists-theoreticians. 
  But it is correct to say that construction is an industry 
which is geared to the maximum extent to the market and, after 
all, we "produce" an end product -- industrial projects and 
housing, which is one of the most important components of human 
existence. This is why I can say that it has become both harder 
and easier for the builders to work under the market. Harder 
because, previously, the customers courted the builders as one 
would a fastidious fiancee. We had a specific selection -- those 
for whom we would build and those who would have to wait. But 
now it is we who "seduce" the customer -- provided he pays cash. 
  But, after all, the opportunities to earn a living have 
emerged! Here is an example: in Moscow, the turnover of 
personnel in contracting organizations has been reduced to 
almost zero. Very first-rate specialists, 75,000 people, who 
were divided into cooperatives at first and who have now 
returned to the normal construction subdivisions. People have 
begun to value a job and, consequently, construction quality has 
risen and labor productivity is increasing. Incidentally, the 
so-called problem of "limiters," thanks to whom Moscow was 
built, disappeared. I am, after all, also a unique kind of 
"limiter," just like many of the highest leaders. 
  We managed to retain in Moscow skilled contract collectives. 
Thanks to this, it was possible to avoid a calamitous drop in 
production volumes, as happened, for example, in machine 
building. 
  [Ursov] These words should be heard by the hundreds of 
thousands of ordinary Muscovites who are not burdened by 
surpluses of money. I have repeatedly encountered opinions which 
go something like this: "so, under the communists, construction 
and development flourished, but these democrats are building 
nothing and just speculating with finished buildings." And, in 
point of fact, nothing like large-scale construction projects 
has been noted in Moscow. 
  [Resin] Perhaps the mass media are at fault in this matter? 
After all, this is how it was previously: when a housing area 
was built, there were reports in the central and Moscow 
newspapers. Now, however, journalists very frequently, in my 
opinion, prefer to write about chopped-off heads. Or about 
financial frauds. The themes, of course, are also not without 
interest. But I follow the rule: it is better to be a 
conservative in one's youth than a radical in one's old age. And 
it is more interesting to me to read about a working person, 
about how, all the same, the country is growing richer and how, 
for example, the market is helping to increase the exchanges of 
new housing. 
  [Ursov] And just what do you mean? 
  [Resin] Of course, if a comparison is made with 1984, the 
scope of construction in Moscow has been curtailed somewhat. 
But, in the period of the last 3 years, we have been steadily 
delivering to the city's inhabitants 3 million square meters of 
housing each year. This, take note, is a record in Russia. 
Everywhere, the pace of social and housing construction has 
fallen sharply. In St. Petersburg, in particular, it has been 
curtailed by a factor of 2 or 3. But Moscow is building. Look, 
the entire center is being renovated. Gertsen, Ogarev and 
Myasnitskaya streets are covered with scaffolding. Here are the 
figures: the overall volume of contract work in 1993 amounted to 
910 billion rubles. This is 100.2 percent of the 1992 amount in 
comparable prices and labor productivity has increased by 5 
percent. We have built 26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12 
polyclinics, 4 hospitals and 25 police stations -- all the 
figures exceed the 1992 level. Among the unique "piecework" 
construction projects are Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Gora, 
the Palace of Justice, the "Palace Hotel," the theater on 
Pokrovka and a museum for private collections. But a new ZIL 
cardan-shaft plant? And a dozen other large industrial 
construction projects? All these are here. The skepticism of the 
people can be understood: still fresh in their memories are the 
promises of the numerous radical democrats who were elected to 
the Moscow council on slogans which were bolshevistic-utopian, 
so to speak: for everyone -- free housing, which we will take 
away from the party members, etc. The worst sort of 
unprofessionalism is when it is in power. Currently, we must 
"shovel out" the promises of that first "Gorbachevian" wave of 
"democrats," which, as I see it, gave the impetus to the 
processes of the unjustified destruction of the administrative 
[management] system. 
  [Ursov] The figures you have cited are unquestionably 
gratifying. Especially with respect to housing construction. I 
am just afraid that they will gladden only those few people who 
are capable of laying out more than 10,000 dollars for an 
apartment. 
  [Resin] We will try to investigate. Previously, the state 
budget in one form or another basically paid for housing 
construction. How many, where and what apartments were to be 
built was decided on a centralized basis, although Moscow had a 
lot of freedom in the selection of priorities. Now, a 
redistribution of funds has occurred: the federal and local 
budgets are no longer so all-encompassing and powerful and an 
enormous amount of financial and credit resources is 
concentrated in non-state banks and commercial structures. It is 
clear that they are inclined to use these funds at their own 
discretion and it will not be possible to "dislodge" them with a 
stick for the construction of municipal housing. What 
possibilities does the Moscow government have, however slim, for 
moving ahead, so that the people who have entrusted their 
futures to the Moscow leaders to a great extent do not become 
disappointed in them? We are selling at auction 1.5 million 
"squares" of housing and the obtained funds are going for free 
apartments. We are transferring the long-term leasing rights to 
private residences in the center on the condition that they be 
renovated based on the principle: half of the housing goes to 
home-building businessmen and half goes into the municipal fund. 
Based on the same criteria, we are granting the right to 
construct new housing. In my opinion, if some entrepreneurs 
manage to accumulate enough money, then they can look after the 
remaining, larger part of society, ordinary workers, engineers 
and pensioners, thanks to whose labor the main portion of public 
wealth has been and is being created. Especially since the smart 
entrepreneurs understand this and are doing it willingly. 
  The people waiting on the lists are receiving a million 
square meters of housing annually as a consequence of this 
policy of the Moscow authorities. And this is approximately 
12,000-15,000 apartments. This is not socialist leveling; 
rather, this is a normal approach for our country, where 
collectivist principles, compassion for one's neighbor and the 
feeling of a human community are traditionally strong.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Guskov, general director of the </F>
Krasnoyarskugol Coal Company, by Vitaliy Pyrkh, RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA correspondent: "We Are Not Heroes: Who Will Keep Russia 
Warm, When It Loses Its Coal Industry?"; Krasnoyarsk, date not 
given] 
  [Text] At one time, KATEK [Kansk-Achinsk Fuel-Energy 
Complex] was included among the five most prestigious new 
construction projects in the era of developed socialism. In the 
bulky monograph, "Energeticheskiye resursy SSSR" [USSR Energy 
Resources], published in 1968, a group of the country's eminent 
coal specialists state, for example, that at the mighty coal 
beds of the Kansk-Achinsk basin in Krasnoyarsk Kray and Kemerovo 
Oblast (Itagskiy Rayon), from the facilities of the first 
section alone, one could build eight to ten unique open-pit coal 
mines, with a total yearly fuel extraction of 330-350 million 
tonnes. 
  Alas, the future became the present, and KATEK, which 
had staggered the imagination with its scale, is today a 
disaster area. The miners of the Borodino Open Pit Coal Mine, 
reduced to despair, have stopped shipping fuel to consumers 
located outside the boundaries of Krasnoyarsk Kray who cannot 
settle with them for the supplies already made, although they 
are so far restraining from the strikes to which all their 
neighbors -- the miners of the Kuzbass -- are persistently 
urging them. 
  Our correspondent interviews Viktor Guskov, general 
director of the Krasnoyarskugol Coal Company, about the problems 
that have formed in KATEK's work collectives. 
  [Pyrkh] Viktor Aleksandrovich, our newspaper reported the 
results of the recent meeting of the minister of the Coal 
Industry and Russian power engineer, Yuriy Shefranik, with the 
Kuzbass coal miners in Kemerovo. Did the talk that took place 
satisfy you? 
  [Guskov] Yes and no. It is a good thing that we are 
beginning 
to realize that, as they say, there is no longer anywhere to go, 
that the next thing is a final, complete breakdown. Practical 
experience shows, though: another month or two, and they will 
forget about the miners. Until next fall. What is put off until 
tomorrow, however, will cost much more. 
  [Pyrkh] Including at KATEK? 
  [Guskov] Well, in general, there is special talk about 
KATEK. 
For several years, we have been trying to convince the 
government of the need to pass a special decree on it. Does 
Russia need it or not? If only Krasnoyarsk Kray needs KATEK, 
then just the coal mine in Borodino will be enough for all our 
power engineers, together with the rank-and-file consumers. If 
not.... They tell us: we do not know how to sort things out with 
the budget workers, and you and your KATEK.... After all, 
though, industry has not yet started an upswing, and one cannot 
"sort things out" with any budget workers. This is an axiom. 
  [Pyrkh] But perhaps this is not really the time, Viktor 
Aleksandrovich? There is this situation in the country, and here 
-- a whole decree, just as in the old days.... Where will the 
money and the material resources come from? 
  [Guskov] We are not insisting on the decree which might have 
been discussed three or four years ago. Let us "dig out" of it 
the urgent problems which must be solved this year, or at the 
most, next year, for our very minimum needs. So that we can buy 
the necessary equipment and spare parts. Otherwise, a terrible 
sobering up awaits us tomorrow: whisk away the "sneakers" from 
today's shop shelves -- and what remains on them? We must, 
finally, solve the main problem: how much and what kind of coal 
must be extracted in the country? That is, we need an 
all-Russian fuel-energy program. 
  [Pyrkh] To put it another way -- Gosplan [State Planning 
Committee]? Is this what you have in mind? 
  [Guskov] Give me the name of just one country in the world 
where the state would give up solving its energy problems? Last 
year, for example, we reduced the volumes of fuel extracted in 
the region by one-third, and they are dropping in Russia too. Is 
this good or bad? 
  Only recently, 420 million tonnes were extracted in Russia, 
and now they are saying that 315 million is enough. According to 
these calculations, the gradual closure of unprofitable mines 
and those operating at a loss is planned. The country's 
production volumes are falling, however, and this means that the 
need for coal is lessening as well. Some people have already 
begun to say that 240 million tonnes of fuel is quite enough for 
Russia! Whether this is so or not, I don't know, but I do know 
something else. If it is so, then that means that the number of 
mines being closed (which ones?) should be much greater. Can we 
stand such social shocks? Where will we get fuel when Russian 
industry calls for it? 
  [Pyrkh] After all, though, the reformers have left the 
solutions to these problems to those watching the market. They 
say, it will arrange everything by locations.... 
  [Guskov] If only it were like that. A coal mine is not a 
bicycle: if you feel like going faster -- you work the pedals 
faster.... Our reformers did the stupidest thing when they 
"froze" prices for coal and other power resources. The prices 
for everything jumped sky-high, and as far back as last summer 
we sold our coal at 350 rubles [R] per tonne. Only now is this 
money coming back to us, but what can you buy for it? A loaf of 
bread, or the poorest sort of flour.... 
  The question is, who needed to wreck the sector on which the 
well-being of any economy is based? Today KATEK is like a fairy 
tale prince sitting on the richest coal deposit in the world 
with his hand outstretched. We are owed R110 billion, and of 
them, R70 billion for the Borodino coal mine alone. But while 
the Borodino workers have R50 billion -- these are the debts of 
the power engineers -- the rest of KATEK will have less than R2 
billion for their share. They tell us: you cannot pay for fuel, 
draw up a promissory note and take the property as security. 
Whose property? The settlement school's? The rayon hospital's? 
  [Pyrkh] Really, it is a closed circle -- coal mining drops, 
and there is nothing with which to pay for it.... 
  [Guskov] In general, the government has created conditions 
for us in which the one who does the best work finds itself with 
the biggest hitch. Having divided the enterprises of the coal 
industry up into four groups -- those who do not need state 
support, those who need it to a negligible degree, etc., it has 
designed a peculiar mortar shell, particularly for those who 
just recently looked at tomorrow with confidence. 
  Well, for instance, the basin near Moscow, the Tulaugol 
Association -- the production cost of fuel there is R10,000. Our 
cost is of a lower order.... This is understandable. KATEK is a 
highly productive mine, equipped with the most modern equipment, 
the old mines are far below it.... Look how things turn out, 
though: you sell the Tulaks your coal, at the production cost 
that has formed -- their basin would be paralyzed tomorrow. They 
sell it for R4,000, or R3,200 a tonne. The question is: whose 
coal will the consumer buy? 
  [Pyrkh] Surely from us? 
  [Guskov] Of course not! By using the railroad tariffs as a 
slip knot, you can drive any competitor into a corner. Already, 
foreign fuel --from Poland, from Germany -- is cheaper than ours 
in the central regions of the country. Be it KATEK's or coal 
from the Kuzbass. The railroad tariffs reach 90 percent of the 
price, and a 10-percent share is left for the coal. It will soon 
be cheaper to transport coal to eastern Russia from Australia or 
Indonesia.... 
  [Pyrkh] As far as I know, it is already close to this in the 
Maritime area, although just recently they were using Siberian 
coal.... 
  [Guskov] Market estimates came up with this: it is a little 
cheaper to buy. Until just recently, the miners of the Maritime 
area sold their fuel at R500 a tonne, a ridiculous price, and 
the consumer, even if he did not have the physical possibility 
of buying it, sat and waited for his turn. Why should he overpay 
for our coal, bearing in mind the fantastic expense of railroad 
transport, when his own was so cheap? We said: you raise the 
prices, you'll get nothing for your pains.... That's what 
happened. 
  The market in general is a cruel instrument, you have to use 
it, like a scalpel, with great care. Here is just one example: 
If you "throw away" one million tonnes of fuel at the mines, you 
have to find jobs for a minimum of 2,000 persons. A complicated 
and expensive pursuit, isn't it? A million tonnes of extraction 
at an open pit coal mine -- that is "only" a few dozen workers. 
Tempting? 
  There is also a temptation here to shift coal extraction 
where it is most profitable for the state. I said as much to the 
minister at a recent conference: it is more profitable for us to 
pay the Tulaks a wage, if only to keep them from extracting 
coal. Who needs anything this expansive? Indeed, the best thing 
is to stop now -- why "drive off" KATEK? We are now spending 
R3,500 for every tonne of coal, and these rubles won't come 
back. Can one work like this? 
  [Pyrkh] After all, though, closing the mines causes a 
tremendous social problem, and conflicts, shocks and storms are 
inevitable. Remember Margaret Thatcher, when, one-and-a-half 
decades ago, she thought up the idea of closing 20 unprofitable 
mines in the British Isles -- what a fuss was made over that! I 
myself transferred over some money in support of the striking 
miners.... 
  [Guskov] And how did it end? The mines were shut down all 
the 
same, although the people, of course were not made to "walk the 
plank." This is what state support, its help constitutes -- not 
chasing into a corner enterprises that do good work, chasing 
them for the sake of having everyone identically good or 
identically bad. 
  How is it, for example, in America? An enterprise was 
closed, 
people were out of work, moved from their areas and went to a 
different state, to a different region of the country. In our 
country? People will die from hunger, but are afraid to make a 
move, even to a neighboring area, 20 or 30 kilometers from their 
own home. Why? Probably because no one is waiting for them 
there. Not because they will have a falling-down, even a 
thatched roof over their head. 
  This is what has to be dealt with, what funds have to 
directed to, not supporting production facilities that are 
operating at a loss or unprofitable! Let the market decide: who 
is "closer" to it -- Vorkuta or KATEK.... 
  [Pyrkh] It is difficult to agree with this, Viktor 
Aleksandrovich. Of course, Vorkuta is not KATEK, but after all, 
the coal there is not like ours -- true black gold, with no 
quotation marks at all. One can mix up with earth, for example, 
the fuel extracted at the northernmost mine of the Vorkutaugol 
Association, Khalmer-Yu, and excellent coke will still be 
obtained. But then a report appeared that the mine is also 
getting ready to close.... It is a pity. Is Russia not leaving 
the North, the Far East? Who will go there? 
  [Guskov] Those same Vorkuta workers calculated: the state 
would have to spend much more capital to find work for the 
Khalmer-Yu miners than is needed to support the mines.... 
  I agree with you, though: The North is a special matter, 
there is no need to hurry with it. Moreover, Vorkuta has already 
spoken its weighty piece once, when the Germans occupied the 
Donbass. Leningrad could not have held out without Arctic fuel. 
  The problem lies in something else: the drop in fuel 
extraction during the year must not be renewed. I know from 
experience: when troubles arise at the mine, what is given up 
first of all? Preparatory work. Then it takes five to seven 
years to "gather our breath," and arrive at the position we had 
already achieved. Hence, the tremendous importance of our KATEK 
for the Russian economy. 
  Right now KATEK has production capacities for a yearly 
extraction of 60 million tonnes of coal, and indeed we can 
extract 70 million in all, and moreover, we don't ask the state 
for a single excavator. Just don't hinder our work! 
  This unique basin must be kept for Russia if we, of course, 
plan to live and not die. Well, this muddle lasts for another 
year, and then another, and then, when the plants start 
operating, where does the state count on getting coal? In about 
five years there will be no place to get it, except at KATEK, 
and the Kuzbass. 
  [Pyrkh] Even considering the geographic situation? 
  [Guskov] What situation? It is worth it for the railroad 
workers, without changing their income, to establish 
differentiated charges for transport -- one, let us say, for 
coal miners, another -- for alcohol producers, various 
manufactured goods, etc. -- and all of industry will breathe a 
sigh of relief. It will start working to the extent of the 
forces it has left. 
  For how could we not relate to our past, how could we not 
curse it, and to use a classic expression, there is nowhere to 
go. It is fuel, it is coal, that is the "bread of industry," 
without which the entire economy of the country will be on 
starvation rations. Without KATEK, Russia is no longer in a 
position to support itself.

<F P=106> [Speech by Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet </F>
of the Republic of Armenia, in Strasbourg: "Armenia Is a 
Democratic State"] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen! 
  I am glad to be here today among you. During my previous 
visits to the Europarliament, when in the West hardly anyone 
talked about the collapse of the last totalitarian empire of the 
20th century, it was this high assembly that realized what 
changes occurred in my country and with its resolutions gave the 
support that Armenia's democracy expected from Europe--the 
defender of human rights and liberties. 
  The movement of the Republic of Armenia toward independence 
and democracy can be characterized by the enumeration of a 
number of key moments. 
  In May 1990, still under the communist order, the strong 
democratic movement succeeded in forming a parliament, which as 
early as August published a manifesto of tasks predetermining 
the establishment of an independent democratic state and freedom 
of political and economic systems. 
<H5>  Political Sphere </H5>
  The Republic of Armenia became a party to international 
pacts 
concerning human rights and adopted the law on the freedom of 
parties. 
  The parliament carried out political reform aimed at 
transforming the system of former soviets based on the principle 
of division of power, which made it possible to retain stability 
in the course of political and economic reforms under foreign 
conditions most difficult for the republic and under the 
blockade. 
  The Republic of Armenia did not accept Gorbachev's 
referendum 
on the preservation of the Union of 17 March 1991 and on 21 
September 1991 through a democratic referendum (with the 
fulfillment of all the requirements of USSR laws) the Republic 
of Armenia became an independent state. 
  Complete freedom of speech and the press, in fact, exists in 
the republic. Numerous independent publications, newspapers, and 
journals and those belonging to various parties appear. In the 
Republic of Armenia today there are more than 30 parties, which 
are represented in the parliament. 
<H5>  Economic Sphere </H5>
  As is well known, for several years Armenia has been under 
an 
economic and energy blockade, which dramatically affects our 
people's life and suffocates the economy. Despite all these 
difficulties reforms are being carried out in our country. 
  Land privatization was carried out everywhere at the 
beginning of 1991, as a result of which as of now the 
agriculture of the Republic of Armenia is almost completely 
private. Housing was privatized, legislative acts were prepared 
for a large-scale program for privatization in production and 
service spheres, and 1994 was planned as the year of 
privatization and reform of the financial and banking system. 
The implemented transformations created the basis, on which the 
draft of the new Constitution of the Republic of Armenia was 
prepared. It has already undergone large-scale discussions. The 
adoption of the Constitution is also envisaged in 1994. 
<H5>  On Nagorno-Karabakh </H5>
  The leadership of the Republic of Azerbaijan continues to 
reject the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem by 
political methods, as a result of which hostilities between the 
Republic of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh become even more 
violent. 
  Not having accepted the CSCE [Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe] timetable, the Republic of Azerbaijan not 
only reduced to naught the efforts of the Minsk CSCE group on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, but also officially announced its 
nonacceptance of UN Security Council resolutions, in which the 
UN Security Council called upon the parties participating in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to accept the CSCE timetable and to 
put an end to the bloodshed. As is well known, the Republic of 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh officially accepted the timetable 
of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh and expressed their 
readiness to carry out UN Security Council resolutions. 
  On the question of the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict the Republic of Azerbaijan to this day rejects both the 
peace-making mediation of the Russian Federation and all the 
initiatives directed toward a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict. The facts of the participation against this background 
of Afghan mujahidin, Turkish military specialists, and Russian 
soldiers in military operations as part of the Azerbaijani Army 
demonstrate that Azerbaijan relies only on the solution of the 
problem by force and the policy of its leadership is aimed at 
expanding the conflict. 
  Having rejected all peace-making efforts, on 18 December 
1993 
Azerbaijan began and to this day continues an 
offensive--unprecedented throughout the history of the Karabakh 
conflict--along the entire front. 
  A full blockade against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh on the 
part of Azerbaijan has continued for more than 4 years. At the 
same time, provocative attempts to draw the Republic of Armenia 
into a major military conflict do not cease. 
  Under such conditions organized self-defense was and remains 
the only guarantee for the life and security of the people of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, because the people of Nagorno-Karabakh do not 
have guarantees on the part of the world community. 
  The world community should give its assessment of the 
aggressive policy of Azerbaijan's leadership, which stubbornly 
strives for an exclusive military resolution of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh confrontation, while in the meantime some 
states continue to give military assistance to Azerbaijan. 
  My visit to Strasbourg takes places within the framework of 
the political dialogue established between the European Union 
and Armenia. 
  I am glad to note that we have succeeded in establishing 
this 
constant communication, which enables us to be better 
understood. I realize that we will have to traverse a long path 
in order to establish closer relations between our two 
institutions. 
  With regard to changes in the European Union and Armenia, 
you 
know that after the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the European Union and Armenia in June 1992 Armenia 
participated in technical assistance programs envisaged for CIS 
countries. Armenia also received humanitarian assistance in the 
European Commission (in 1993 about 18 million ECU). In 
particular, the latest deliveries of mazut must be noted. 
  Armenia also received credits twice (38 and 20 million ECU), 
most of which went for the purchase of grain. 
  There is another sphere, in which the European Union can 
help 
Armenia--this is the sphere of nuclear power. 
  The serious energy crisis led to the fact that the 
government 
of Armenia adopted a decision on the restart of one unit of the 
Metsamor Nuclear Station. In connection with this Armenia asked 
the Union for technical assistance, as well as for the financing 
necessary for the implementation of this program. 
  It goes without saying that the implementation of this 
program, the goal of which is to meet most of the energy needs, 
is of vital importance for the economy of my country. 
  Such is the considerable assistance granted us by the 
European Union. 
  Despite all this the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has a certain 
effect on mutual relations between the European Union and 
Armenia. Thus, despite the mandate issued to the European 
Commission by the European Union on the beginning of 
negotiations for the purpose of signing partnership agreements 
among all former USSR countries and the European Union, such 
negotiations did not begin with Armenia. The conduct of such 
negotiations with the Transcaucasian republics is connected with 
the establishment of stability in the region, in particular with 
the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. At the same 
time, Armenia--the only state in the Transcaucasus that has 
internal stability, has carried out serious economic reforms, 
has laid down the foundations for a democratic society, and 
respects human rights and liberties--is the object of a parity 
attitude on the part of the European Union: the principle of a 
differentiated approach to Transcaucasian countries is reduced 
to naught. 
  It is difficult to understand such an attitude on Europe's 
part if we take into account that Armenia's attitude toward 
peaceful negotiations held within the framework of the Minsk 
CSCE group was constructive, whereas Azerbaijan's nonacceptance 
of the program of nine members of the Minsk group, which sets 
the task of implementation of UN resolutions, places on it the 
responsibility for the intensification of the violence in the 
region. 
  In this context the European Union's breaking away from 
conducting any negotiations with Armenia for the purpose of 
concluding partnership agreements can prove to be predetermining 
for the process of transformations begun in Armenia. 
  We also believe that the European Union has the opportunity 
to hold a more serious position in the cause of the search for 
the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through 
negotiations--by means of three participant countries, which are 
members of the Minsk CSCE group, and the appointment of 
observers of the European Union there. 
  I hope that the Europarliament will raise before the 
European 
Union and the commission matters important from its point of 
view and will take advantage of its opportunities to inform the 
Union's legal institutions of all these factors and to submit 
proposals to them for rendering technical, financial, and 
humanitarian assistance to Armenia.

<F P=106> [Article by Vaga Amirkhanyan: "Dram... and Only Dram"] </F>
  [Text] The information debut of the new management of the 
Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, finally, took place 
yesterday. 
  Bagrat Asatryan, manager of the Central Bank, in his first 
words expressed his intention and hope for a more constructive 
dialogue with the press. Because, according to him, previous 
dialogues were of a critical rather than a realistic nature. 
  Not considering concrete matters more expedient today, Mr. 
Asatryan dwelled on the global programs of the Central Bank. 
They represent the transformation of the old banking system into 
a modern independent structure answering the requirements of an 
independent state. This is a complex task--with due regard for 
the difficult legacy of the past. 
  Next Mr. Asatryan reported that meetings of the management 
of 
the Central Bank with the prime minister and the president of 
the Republic of Armenia had already been held. The latter are 
well informed about the problems of the Central Bank and intend 
to give it proper assistance. With regard to the press coverage 
of Central Bank activity Mr. Asatryan asked that patience and 
restraint be shown--at least at first. However, he promised to 
let the press into the "dark alleys" of the banking system at a 
later date, of course, within the limits of what is permissible. 
  Then Bagrat Asatryan and deputy manager Armen Darbinyan 
answered journalists' questions. The questions were most 
diverse: the very first programs and financial policy of the 
Central Bank, the problem of transfers and pensions, the 
prospects of the dram, the possibility of entering the ruble 
zone, assistance on the part of international organizations, 
inflation of the dram, the problem of the currency rate, and so 
forth. 
  The transformation of the Central Bank into an independent 
organism and the development of the money and credit program 
and, in general, of the financial policy were mentioned as the 
principal and paramount goal of the Central Bank. 
  Regarding the transfers of pension allowances: Although they 
are made in the course of work, a global solution of the problem 
is a long-term task. With regard to the prospects of the 
national currency, according to Mr. Asatryan, the last month 
demonstrates a certain stabilization of currency. At least a 
free rate of the dram already exists. 
  The report that as yet not a single state has recognized the 
dram as Armenia's official currency was very depressing. 
Nevertheless, in Asatryan's opinion, there is no way back, that 
is, to the ruble zone. The manager of the Central Bank even 
expressed surprise about this matter: Armenia as an independent 
state should have and has a national currency. The fact that 
this currency is secured to one extent or another--depending on 
the present level of economic development--is another matter. Be 
that as it may, the idea of the strengthening and stabilization 
of the dram as the primary goal of the Central Bank was 
expressed very unequivocally. At the same time, the intention to 
establish a single--instead of the present three--rate of 
currency units was expressed. Hope was also expressed concerning 
support on the part of international organizations. At least, 
according to the management of the Central Bank, the matter is 
not closed. And besides, can it be closed if nonpolitical 
(according to their representatives) organizations, in fact, 
advance arguments of a political nature? 
  With regard to clearing transactions with CIS states, 
according to Mr. Darbinyan, negotiations on this point with the 
central banks of these states lie ahead. The matter of the 
establishment of a single clearing center is touched upon. An 
interstate bank for settlements with CIS states will function in 
Moscow soon. This will not solve problems on a global scale, but 
will greatly improve the situation. 
  Well, we shall see what we shall see. Especially as, apart 
from the forthcoming de-facto glasnost and openness, Messrs. 
Asatryan and Darbinyan promised journalists and, consequently, 
the republic's entire public, glasnost and openness in Central 
Bank activity.

<F P=106> [Article by A.Kh.: "Attempt on Me Is Technically Unfeasible"] </F>
  [Text] A regular press conference by V. Siradegyan, 
minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Armenia, was 
held yesterday. The minister reported that a tendency toward a 
decline in criminal activity appeared in the republic: As 
compared with the corresponding period of last year, the number 
of registered crimes was reduced by almost 20 percent. The 
number of nonregistered offenses also decreased. This is due to 
the fact that, in contrast to past years, the "nonclear-up rate" 
[of crimes] no longer hangs like a sword of Damocles over the 
head of the militia. There are fewer premeditated murders and 
cases of malicious hooliganism and the fight against the drug 
mafia has been activated (today 47 so-called hustlers are 
imprisoned, whereas previously the fight was waged almost 
exclusively against drug users). The number of road-transport 
accidents decreased by 40 percent. However, the minister noted 
realistically that, probably, this is not so much to the credit 
of the traffic police--rather the cost of gasoline is to be 
"blamed" for this: Not everyone can afford to drive around in 
his own car. Along with this, a certain increase in offenses 
among adolescents has been noted. Second offenses remain at the 
previous level. The prosecution of counterfeiters has 
intensified. Fifty-three attempts to disseminate counterfeit 
dollars and Russian rubles have been stopped. However, the 
"center" of this activity still remains unknown and it is not 
ruled out that it is outside the republic. Fortunately, attempts 
to counterfeit drams (amateurish work is counted out) have not 
yet been registered. 
  On the whole, the clear-up rate of crimes remains at the 
level of 50 percent. The lack of coordination among 
corresponding services of CIS countries greatly hampers a rise 
in this indicator, which enables offenders to escape punishment 
by leaving Armenia. V. Siradegyan expressed the hope that a 
coordinating council of six administrations of ministries of 
internal affairs of all the commonwealth states will soon be 
established and begin to operate. Appropriate government 
agreements have already been signed and this will help an 
efficient coordination of the efforts of law enforcement bodies. 
Unfortunately, we have not yet succeeded in establishing 
constructive cooperation with our Georgian colleagues--and not 
through the fault of the Armenian side. Therefore, the question 
of the joint protection of transport and power infrastructures 
on the territory of this country continues to remain open. 
  According to the minister, the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
continues to fight against criminals in its own ranks as well. 
On the ministry's recommendation the procuracy instituted 18 
criminal proceedings against militiamen who broke the law. More 
than 700 people were dismissed from "agencies" owing to 
distrust. At the same time, there are cuts in the central 
apparatus, whose workers are sent to reinforce lower links. "The 
process of merging of the militia with the mafia is weakening," 
V. Siradegyan said. "This is largely due to the fact that most 
criminal elements capable of establishing relations with 
dishonorable workers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are in 
places of detention today." The minister believes that, even if 
the last circumstance does not fully remove the danger of an 
emergence of a so-called mafioso state from the agenda, it 
reduces such a possibility markedly. 
  Many rumors and conjectures about Honda cars, which have 
entered the system of the traffic police, have arisen today. 
Discussing this, the director of the internal department noted 
that this purchase was much cheaper than the purchase of Russian 
Zhiguli would be. Furthermore, the efficiency of Japanese cars 
is incomparably higher, as is the speed. "In no way should the 
militia be inferior to criminals in operational efficiency," V. 
Siradegyan noted. "In Armenia today up to 2,000 Mercedes, BMW, 
and other most modern cars are under private ownership. It is 
known that many of their owners are potential criminals. We must 
have technical capabilities in order to at least not be inferior 
to them in speed." 
  To the question how V. Siradegyan assessed the fact of the 
liquidation of the Main Administration of National Security and 
reorganization of special services, the minister answered that 
this was a positive phenomenon. Possibly, he stressed, this will 
finally make it possible to seriously engage in the 
investigation of the murder of former KGB chairman M. Yuzbashyan 
and a number of crimes similar in the manner of execution and 
public response. V. Siradegyan did not rule out that specialists 
of the former USSR KGB "liquidated" Yuzbashyan. This attempt was 
organized very professionally. In particular, only one shot was 
fired, but several cartridge cases were planted at the site of 
the crime in order to "blur" the real picture of what had 
happened. "Yuzbashyan knew a great deal about the period when 
the processes around Nagorno-Karabakh originated and who did 
this and how and that is why he could have become completely 
`superfluous' for certain forces in Moscow," the minister 
stressed. 
  Speaking about the accusations leveled at him by Moscow 
businessman S. Dzhilavyan, the head of Armenia's Ministry of 
Internal Affairs stated that he would not want to react to such 
things, because this would mean the "formation of a certain 
political figure out of a complete nonentity." At the same time, 
he noted that, making these kinds of accusations (we would like 
to recall that S. Dzhilavyan declared that Siradegyan, 
allegedly, wanted to organize an attempt on him), the Moscow 
businessman made a very big mistake. "He himself will be killed 
sooner or later--either by creditors or by other mafiosos. 
However, no one will search for them and investigate this case 
in Russia. After all, Dzhilavyan himself pointed to the 
`Armenian trace.' After this it will hardly occur to anyone to 
seriously take up his case," V. Siradegyan noted. 
  Concerning rumors about an attempt on him himself, about his 
aspiration to hold the post of prime minister, and about his 
expected departure for residence in another country the minister 
said that an attempt on him was unfeasible from the technical 
point of view, he could not become prime minister, because he 
did not consider himself capable of executing this post, and, in 
general, similar jokes within the walls of the Council of 
Ministers were not particularly ethical. He did not intend to 
leave Armenia for anywhere: "There is no other country in the 
world where I would like to live."

<F P=106> [Article by Gamarshakh Dzhavadov and Rauf Guseynov: "Is </F>
There To Be Any State Concept of an Ethnic Policy?"] 
  [Text] The representatives of 115 ethnic groups reside in 
Azerbaijan, along with the Azerbaijani, who are the most 
numerous people, both in their historic homeland and throughout 
the Caucasus, and the second in the world with respect to the 
number of Turkish-speaking people. The referendum of 29 December 
1991 has the force of a legal act, legally securing the cohesion 
and equality of all citizens of the Azerbaijani State, as a 
unified nation. Azerbaijani citizens and Turko-Akhyskhi 
(Meskheten citizens), Russians and Udi, Ukrainians and 
Assyrians, Belarusians and Talyshi, Budukhi and Tati, Khinalugi 
and Kurds, Krizi and Lezgini, Avari and Jews, Ingili and 
Tsakhuri and others -- all have equal rights in the land of 
Azerbaijan and of their own will have shown the world that they 
regard this country, with which their past, present and future, 
and all their thoughts are related, as their own common native 
land. 
  History and the present day, however, attest to the fact 
that 
such harmonious agreement in the life of the multi-ethnic people 
of Azerbaijan is not to everyone's liking. Over the past few 
decades, destructive forces, both within and from without, have 
repeatedly tried and continue to try to sow dissension among 
Azerbaijan's ethnic groups, particularly to incite them against 
the Azerbaijani. They have partially succeeded in their 
attempts: one of the terrible consequences was the Karabakh 
problem and the never-ending chain of military-political, 
ethno-confessional and socio-economic collisions of domestic and 
foreign order connected with it. The most monstrous result is 
the genocide of Azerbaijani citizens and the many years of 
undeclared war between Armenia and the people of Azerbaijan. The 
main goal is to annihilate the Azerbaijani ethnic group and 
seize its lands, and to provoke small ethnic groups into leaving 
the structure of the Azerbaijani Republic. That is why we 
qualify the Karabakh problem thrust on Azerbaijan as part of an 
international conspiracy, aimed against the Islam and Turkish 
world and at escalation of ethnic conflicts and regional wars. 
The point is that Azerbaijan occupies a convenient strategic 
region in the Caucasus, rich in natural resources and raw 
material, and has a modern industrial and transport 
infrastructure. Realization of the plans is therefore related to 
the intention of creating in Azerbaijan other "Karabakhs," in 
which anti-Azerbaijan forces have also succeeded: some of the 
leaders of certain ethnic groups in Azerbaijan, heated up 
because of the military cordon, are demanding "independence" and 
"reunification" with their fellow countrymen. 
  One of the effective responses to these attempts was the 
presidential edict of 16 September 1992 "On Protecting the 
Rights and Freedoms and on State Support of the Development of 
the Language and Culture of Ethnic Minorities, Small Numbers of 
People and Ethnic Groups Residing in the Azerbaijani Republic." 
An important help in putting it into effect is, in addition to 
the activity of official structures, the activity of cultural 
societies of Slavs and Udi, Russian and Tati, Lezgini and 
Talyshi, Kurds and Jews, and also of the National Academy of 
Sciences of the multi-specialty Institute of Ethnic Relations. 
Within the framework of the institute, a special department is 
at work to study small ethnic groups, and is designed to help 
solve the group of problems, in conjunction with analogous 
departments in the institutes of Literature, Linguistics, 
Pedagogy and Teacher Improvement, and with cultural centers and 
societies. At the same time, success in the sphere of an ethnic 
policy in many ways depends on how fully we succeed in getting 
the indisputable truth to each representative of the small 
ethnic groups: if there is discrimination against any of them, 
this means a similar fate, in no lesser degree, has been readied 
for the Azerbaijani themselves. 
  Let us recall the years of Stalinist repressions and the 
totalitarian system, when Azerbaijani citizens and other 
Turkish-speaking peoples of the USSR were subjected to 
persecution on the widest scale. It was these people who were 
deprived of their alphabets and the better part of the 
intelligentsia, their territory and cultural monuments. Even in 
our times one can mention definite discrimination against 
Azerbaijani citizens, but now it is within the limits of their 
own state. These are the attempts of certain Azerbaijanophiles, 
together with the state officials from the ruling NFA [People's 
Front of Azerbaijan], to link the history and culture of 
Azerbaijan with the Turkish world from the beginning. Among 
these can be included the striving of others to see the sources 
of everything Azerbaijani stemming from the time that Islam 
appeared. Still others tried to link Azerbaijani citizens to 
everything Iranian. Directly connected to these false ideas, it 
seems to us, is the renaming of the Azerbaijani language in 
Turkish (a law of December 1992), even though not one of the 
peoples speaking the languages of the Turkic family hit upon 
this. The Uzbek speak Uzbek, Khakassia -- Khakassian, Yakut -- 
Yakut, Chuvashia -- Chuvashian. The list can go on. As a result, 
there is an imminent threat of ethnic and linguistic conflicts, 
leading to open confrontation on the part of the small ethnic 
groups. The linguistic policy is one of the most important 
aspects of ethnic relations, and language can become a catalyst 
and detonator of an interethnic collision, which is being 
observed even now in the Azerbaijani Republic. This is one of 
the reasons why the small ethnic groups of Azerbaijan 
"remembered" that each of them also speak in their own language, 
about their own "historical past." 
  In a word, the situation has grown complicated, and is 
fraught with the danger that the Azerbaijani Republic will 
explode from within. There is, however, a possibility of 
avoiding cataclysms in the ethnic sphere. For this we must use 
the existing world experience and historical past, and draw 
specialists in various fields and an intelligent part of the 
leaders of the cultural societies of small ethnic groups into 
creating a state conceptual program of ethnic policy.

  [Text] Nazim Imanov, deputy chairman of a major opposition 
movement in our republic, the Azerbaijan National Independence 
Party [ANIP], said in an interview with a Kheber-Servis [News 
Service] correspondent: "Systematic persecution of party members 
in a number of Azerbaijan's rayons has begun. This is especially 
notable in Ujar Rayon. One of the candidates for membership in 
the party's Central Council of this rayon was threatened, 
another ANIP member was arrested and beaten by officials of the 
law enforcement organs." As N. Imanov stated, local government 
organs ordered court medical experts not to take note of the 
bodily wounds on these persons. He said further that Shahin 
Hummeteliyev, chief of the local police department, gave the 
orders for this work. Sh. Hummeteliyev, committing these evil 
deeds in the name of high officials in the republic, is acting 
arbitrarily in Ujar Rayon. The deputy chairman of ANIP explained 
that if this kind of arbitrary action continues, he would 
publish the names of the above-mentioned high officials.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major-General Iskender Allahverdiyev, deputy </F>
minister of National Security of the Azerbaijan Republic and 
commander of the border troops, by Sohbet Seferli: "There Is No 
Foundation To Rumors That Border Troops From Another State Will 
Be Stationed On Our Borders"] 
  [Text] Recently a meeting of border troops' commanders of 
CIS states was held in Ashgabat. At this meeting, attended also 
by a delegation from the Azerbaijan Republic, documents prepared 
on the smuggling of narcotic substances across borders, 
additional changes to the staff structure of liaison services of 
the Council of Border Troops Commanders, mutual principles of 
the material-technical equipment of border troops, the 
submission of an accounting of the 1993 costs of liaison 
services and a draft of costs for the first quarter of 1994, 
plans of the Commanders' Council and and their liaison services 
for the first half of this year, the time and places of regular 
meetings of the Commanders' Council, and other important 
questions were discussed. In connection with this, our 
correspondent met with Major General Iskender Allahverdiyev, 
deputy minister of National Security and commander of the border 
troops, and interviewed him. He said: 
  "The Council of Border Troops Commanders will meet once a 
quarter and discuss questions pertaining to borders. Since the 
Azerbaijan Republic has also joined the CIS, it is natural that 
we participate in the planning of this organization. At present, 
Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Azerbaijan have established 
their own border troops, and other states of the former USSR are 
in the process of doing so. The need for our participation at 
this meeting also stems from the fact that borders between the 
CIS states are porous, and the organization of the defense of 
borders with non-foreign states cannot but disturb each of us. 
Certainly this disturbance also pertains to us, and one of the 
issues discussed at the Council's Ashgabat meeting was on the 
protection of state borders under conditions of mutual 
cooperation." 
  The establishment of material-technical equipment on the 
borders was also widely discussed. As is known, the basic 
equipment used in protecting the borders is produced in Russia 
and other states. From this point of view, for the best 
organization of our borders, we have to cooperate on reaching 
compatibility with the CIS states. 
  Finally, the passage of narcotic substances, weapons and 
other contraband products across borders was an important 
question of interest to all the states. Discussion of this 
question, which is not within the power of any one state to 
solve on its own, also aroused great interest among meeting 
participants. It remains to say that there is no foundation for 
the rumors being spread on the stationing of troops from another 
state on the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic. As for the 
recent quick visit to Baku of Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander in chief of Russian border troops, this had nothing to 
do with the issue. His journey was in connection with our 
borders with Russia. In general, Russia believes that we can 
protect our own border. 
  [Seferli] General. Quite some time has passed since the 
border troops in our republic were established. What is the 
situation today? 
  [Allahverdiyev] Certainly, in spite of all the difficulties, 
we are making progress and the border troops have been created. 
It goes without question that had there been no war, we would 
have been able to do this job much faster. Our zealous and brave 
specialist officers in the national army are fighting the enemy. 
Hopefully, after the war is ended the majority of them will 
return to the border troops. Our young officers are also 
maturing. There is a special faculty at the Bak All Forces 
Commanders' School which is training border officers. We are 
participating closely in its operations. From next year, more 
young officers will be sent to border detachments and take part 
in the creation of border troops. 
  [Seferli] Our borders in the occupied territories have been 
destroyed by the enemy. As the result of brave attacks by our 
soldiers, a significant portion of our borders with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran have been liberated. How will the repair work 
in these territories be conducted? What kind of help will the 
CIS states offer? 
  [Allahverdiyev] In fact, some of our borders are in very bad 
shape, but this is not to say that our borders cannot be 
protected. There has to be the technical means, meaning 
technical equipment, channels of communication, etc., for border 
protection. In the opinion of most of the participants at the 
meeting, barbed wire should not be strung across the borders 
again. Borders have to be protected in a civilized manner, as in 
the European countries. There is no doubt that there has to be 
political and economic stability in our countries for this; the 
appropriate laws have to be prepared and normal conditions for 
the protection of borders have to be created. 
  In the border zone liberated from the enemy, engineering and 
technical equipment and buildings have been considerably 
damaged, and in some places buildings have been burned to the 
ground. Our border troops, in conjunction with our national 
army, have been restoring our borders as soon as they have been 
liberated. I would like to make use of this opportunity to say 
to your readers that the protection of borders is a matter for 
the state and all its people. If we do not believe in each 
other, on the contrary, if we hurl inappropriate accusations at 
each other, if we make our work more difficult, we will be 
unable to achieve the desired result. All of us, whether at the 
state level or at the level of the normal citizen, must help in 
the protection of our borders and help our border troops. All of 
us are obligated to give this help.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustem Kamal: "Strong Customs Control Can Impede </F>
Smuggling And Narcobusiness"] 
  [Text] A meeting was held between the Republic Customs 
Committee and the Chief Administration for the Struggle Against 
Smuggling and the Violation of Customs Regulations. The meeting 
was devoted to summing up work done last year and defining the 
duties standing before them. Shahin Jahangirov, head of the 
Chief Administration, in his analysis of work done in 1993, 
stated that last year serious shortcomings were allowed in this 
sector. He mentioned the names of workers who were lax in this 
job. The speaker also said that in the sector of the struggle 
against smuggling and customs violations the work of the customs 
houses in Bilesuvar, Sumgait, Khachmaz, Aghstafa, Imishli, 
Khudaferin, Balaken and Yevlakh were especially deficient. In 
some cases instances of smuggling and customs violations were 
not accepted by the court because they were incompetently 
prepared from the legal standpoint. Along with this, he noted 
that following just criticism leveled at customs workers by 
Heydar Eliyev, a serious turning point had been reached in the 
committee's work. 
  In the last two months alone, 23,700 US dollars, 6,300 
Iranian Riyals, 40 truckloads of iron pipe, 1,633 tons of metal, 
3,129 aluminum plates, 620 grams of mercury, and various types 
of night vision and other optical equipment in the process of 
being smuggled out of the country were seized and held by 
workers of the Chief Administration. 
  There was also serious conversation about a question which 
created excitement at the meeting. This was the search for 
effective ways to conduct the struggle against the 
narcobusiness, which is a world problem. Last year seven 
kilograms of narcotic substances were seized and confiscated by 
customs workers.. On the basis of investigations conducted and 
facts obtained they were able to come to the conclusion that 
those engaged in narcobusiness consider Azerbaijan to be a 
critical place, since it is the shortest route from the Orient 
to Europe and they want to use it as a transit point. From the 
speeches it became clear that the use of specially trained dogs 
from Russia has led to good progress in this sector. It was also 
stressed that the cooperation of all law enforcement agencies of 
the republic in the fight against narcobusiness is essential. 
  One of the speakers at the meeting, Huseyn Memmedov, a 
responsible worker at the Ministry of National Security, also 
emphasized the importance of such cooperation. Participants at 
the meeting considered Azerbaijan's membership in the 
International Association against Narcomania and the 
Narcobusiness to be a positive event.. It is considered 
important that cooperation with it in this sector continue in 
the future. 
  There was also discussion of the customs workers being 
subjected to the use of weapons in some places. Thus, issuing 
customs workers engaged in the struggle against smugglers 
weapons was noted as a demand of the day. 
  In addition, committee workers expressed their disturbance 
on 
the inappropriate interference by law enforcement organs 
exceeding their authority in regions where customs houses are 
operating. 
  Speakers noted that Azerbaijan as an independent state 
maintains free economic relations with the countries of the 
world, and a number of foreign states transport goods out of our 
republic. As a result of this, customs workers come across new 
illegal types of international trade. Some of these involve 
extremely expensive goods. These open up new possibilities for 
potential smugglers. There are also many who wish to smuggle 
valuable national and historically important art works and 
strategic goods abroad. Speakers noted the important of 
establishing customs intelligence in order to conduct an 
effective fight against those wishing to do our country material 
or spiritual harm. 
  In the course of the meeting one reached the conclusion that 
workers of the Customs Committee understand well how much damage 
can be done to our country by criminals smuggling valuable goods 
abroad. Now the basic question is the transition from the word 
to the deed in this difficult time for our country because the 
economic power of a country which has been drawn into war and 
part of which is occupied depends on the activity of its customs 
workers.

<F P=106> [AzerTAJ report: "Meetings in Tehran"] </F>
  [Text] The 4th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers 
of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) in Iran's capital 
ended. A delegation from Azerbaijan headed by our Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Hesen Hesenov, also took part in the session. 
The heads of foreign policy administrations of Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, 
Turkmenistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan attended. Hamid el-Gabil, 
ECO's general secretary, leaders of a number of UN organizations 
and commissions, Ahmed Muhammed Ali, president of the Islamic 
Development Bank, and representatives of the World Health 
Organization were invited as guests. This information is 
provided by the press center of the Azerbaijan Republic Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. 
  Akber Hashimi-Rafsanjani, President of Iran, opening the 
session, said the importance of expanding cooperation in the 
region was pressing. He also expressed his disappointment in the 
continuation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. 
  Ali Akber Vilayeti, Iran's Foreign Minister, Serdar Asif 
Ali, 
Pakistan's Foreign Minister, and Hikmet Chetin, Turkey's Foreign 
Minister, spoke sharply condemning Armenia's aggression against 
Azerbaijan and demanded the rapid withdrawal of occupation 
forces and their speedy departure from the territory they occupy 
in Azerbaijan. 
  Hesen Hesenov spoke at the session on behalf of Azerbaijan's 
delegation. He informed the conference participants about 
changes which had occurred in the life of the republic in the 
period since the time that Azerbaijan became a member of the 
organization at the last session of the ECO Ministers' Council. 
The minister, dwelling on Armenia's continuing aggression 
against Azerbaijan, appealed to the ECO members to show 
solidarity with the people of Azerbaijan, and to take concrete 
steps and impose economic and political sanctions against the 
aggressor. H. Hesenov discussed questions of economic 
cooperation and noted the need to broaden cooperation primarily 
in the transport and communications sectors. Concrete proposals 
by the head of the Azerbaijan delegation have been included in 
ECO's action program for 1994. 
  The session confirmed the plan of measures for the current 
year. ECO members planned to hold meetings of Red Crescent 
societies, and cooperation committees in the energy sector and 
especially in the transport and communications sectors in Baku. 
  Within the framework of the session, Hesen Hesenov mentioned 
meetings with heads of political administrations whose countries 
are ECO members and a number of bilateral meetings with heads of 
international organizations. In the course of meetings with E. 
Omuraliyev, B. Shykhmyradov, T. Suleymanov, P. Alymov and S. 
Seidgasymov, the heads of delegations from Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, H. Hesenov 
passed on to leaders of the Central Asian countries personal 
letters from H. Eliyev, president of Azerbaijan. 
  E. Omuraliyev, T. Suleymanov and R. Alimov stopped off in 
Baku on their return from Tehran at the invitation of H. 
Hesenov. They spoke on the telephone with Heydar Eliyev, the 
republic's president. He expressed the hope that the Central 
Asian states would support Azerbaijan in the just struggle 
conducted by its people to restore the country's sovereignty and 
its territorial integrity. The head of state also noted the need 
to strengthen profitable mutual cooperation with countries in 
the Central Asian region, and wished to peoples of these states 
peace and security.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article by Georgian Republic Procuracy Press </F>
Service: "Defective Work Style and Its Deplorable Results. In 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry They Don't Care 
About the Legality of Juridical Acts, Which Seriously Hurts the 
Common Cause"] 
  [Text] It is a fact that there are many problems and 
shortcomings in Georgia's agriculture now, and the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Industry has contributed its "share" to 
this, but right now we will only discuss one defective aspect of 
its activity--the legality of juridical acts issued this year 
and last by the Ministry's officials. 
  The Procuracy's General Oversight Administration 
recently examined the question, and it appears that the legality 
of such acts is of no concern to the Ministry's officials. The 
chronological sequence of orders is grossly violated, and 
revisions, additions, erasures, and wrong numberings are made to 
them regularly, on the basis of somebody's wishes or 
highhandedness, and so on. Most surprising is the fact that 
orders signed by Ministry officials have had changes made to 
them by lower-ranking officials. No one knows why this is. 
  Often, orders signed by Ministry officials have comments 
written by other persons. Sometimes, in addition, separate 
documents are written which cancel juridical acts, although the 
reason is not given, nor are they signed. The rule is that a 
given act can only be cancelled by issuing a new order. Examples 
of such highhanded action include the cancellation of the former 
Agriculture Ministry's order of 27 August 1992 and the former 
Food and Processing Industry Ministry's orders of 5 and 7 
October 1992, and so on. 
  People in the Ministry also resort to what is known as 
stopping orders. And it's done in funny ways. In particular, a 
hand-written note is inserted in the orders book in place of the 
juridical act that has been removed. Unfortunately, these notes 
are written by technical personnel or even secretaries and 
typists. 
  Officials of both the Ministry and its subsidiary 
enterprises 
and organizations often cancel previous orders with the terse 
note "cancelled" instead of issuing a new order. It is left 
vague just what the grounds were and why it all happened; just 
try to guess. 
  Especially deplorable is the fact that the Ministry does 
issue orders, but the stipulations are not fulfilled, as a 
result of poor follow-through discipline. For example, a 
Ministry executive order cancelled the Gori Outfitting Depot 
Director's order and directed him to return to the proper 
quarters 421,000 rubles' worth of fixed assets, vehicles, and 
implements that had been turned over to another organization 
without the Ministry's permission, and to show the value on the 
balance sheet. According to the balance sheet it submitted, the 
enterprise had done everything, but in fact it had not. To this 
day, neither the fixed assets nor their value have been returned. 
  The same route has also been taken by organizations under 
the 
Ministry. The Sakkonservi [Russian Gruzkonserv] Association 
issued an order transferring the uninstalled and unused 
machinery and equipment of the now-abolished Tkviavi Canning 
Plant from its own books to be distributed to other enterprises, 
but it never followed up on its order. All that fine equipment 
has been left out in the open; it is rusting and being stripped 
and wrecked. 
  Juridical acts that are taken arbitrarily are hurting the 
country materially. The Ministry's executives most generously, 
and illegally, provided assistance to apparatus personnel. In 
the course of several months, they spent 9 million rubles on 
this. They often issued unlawful juridical acts giving lump-sum 
assistance by way of exception. Money was given in this way to 
outside persons as well. Meanwhile, the orders do not specify 
the type of incentive or the reasons for it. 
  There have been many cases of using disciplinary punishment 
not provided for in the labor law against Ministry workers and 
employees. These constitute gross violations of the Code of 
Labor Laws of the Georgian Republic. For example, the Ministry 
issued an order by which the head of the Republic Association of 
Specialized Livestock Complexes was given a stern reprimand and 
a final warning--yet the law does not call for a final warning 
as a disciplinary punishment. Unfortunately, there have been 
many such cases. 
  Ministry officials (Minister Otar Kvesitadze) and certain 
association executives sometimes fail to carry out court 
decisions. For example, the Tbilisi Mtatsminda Rayon Court's 
rulings calling for the immediate reinstatement of G. 
Burdzhanadze, the director of the Kvemo Chala Prepared Food 
Plant (Kaspi Rayon), to his post, were never complied with. Even 
though the rulings were sustained by the City Court. 
  There are also instances of illegal orders in the case of 
transferring workers and employees to other jobs. Unprecedented 
in this regard is the use of transfer procedures to appoint 
Juridical Administration Head I. Lomtatidze to the post of head 
of the Disputes, Methodology, and Codification Department and, 
simultaneously, the deputy head of the Juridical Administration. 
This was without his consent, which is impermissible. There are 
too many such cases. 
  Other violations and improprieties have also been found in 
the Ministry. Many orders are issued to abolish enterprises and 
installations without even indicating which law or normative act 
serves as the basis for the liquidation, whether a liquidation 
commission has been created, what specific measures must be 
taken to dismiss workers and employees legally, find jobs for 
them, and so on. That's what happened, for example, to the 
Vivariumi Scientific-Control Center for Veterinary Drugs. The 
land it occupied, and its buildings, were turned over to the 
Gldani State Farm, but the relevant documents say nothing about 
laying off its workers and employees or finding other jobs for 
them. The same thing happened in the case of the transfer of a 
training-methods office to the Institute for the Training and 
Upgrading of Qualifications of Food Industry Leadership 
Personnel. 
  The disrespect which Ministry officials have for the law can 
be seen clearly by looking at cases in which depreciated cars 
have been sold to certain officials. This improper practice is 
rooted in the past and still persists. In July of 1992, an order 
was written with an enclosure by which retired and depreciated 
GAZ-24 vehicles were sold to certain officials. This constituted 
an evasion of the law, in that the vehicles were sold to persons 
who had been using them, whereas according to a decree of the 
Georgian government the right to buy such vehicles was to be 
given to personnel recommended by the labor collective and, as a 
rule, a general assembly had to decide whom the car could be 
sold to. Especially surprising is a recent Ministry order by 
which a vehicle was given as a gift to one enterprise official 
(?!). 
  Some juridical acts have to do with cases of damage to the 
state, on the basis of which officials and materially 
responsible persons have been dismissed, except the question of 
recovery of the damages has been "left out" and no measures have 
been taken. 
  There is no end to unlawfulness in the Ministry. This is due 
to the fact that some bureaus in the Ministry often conduct 
inspections and document audits in a superficial and low-quality 
manner and issue orders that are equally meaningless and fail to 
properly evaluate and react to serious legal violations. 
  One graphic example of this is an order of 2 August which 
has 
to do with the findings of an audit of the economic-financial 
activities of the Ministry's Administration of Management and 
Service Organizations. Along with numerous legal violations it 
points out that four years ago the Administration (which was 
then the Saksopkvebservisi [Russian Gruzselpishcheservis] 
Association), sold the Vazi Hotel for 40,000 dollars. Of that 
sum, 16,700 dollars went for charity work and other activities, 
while the bank has blocked the remaining 22,000 dollars in its 
account to this day. 
  For some reason, this order--and the audit document that was 
written prior to it--"failed" to observe legality of the sale of 
the hotel, the proper use of the money, why the bank has blocked 
the 22,000 dollars, and so on. In fact, other republic control 
departments have deemed the sale of the Vazi illegal, and the 
currency realized from the sale is subject to be deposited to 
the budget, because the building was not depreciated and was not 
to be sold; moreover, the government had not given its 
permission. As for the charity, 8.8 [as printed] pounds sterling 
were given, totally wrongly, to send a few students from the 
Foreign Language Institute to attend a London college for a 
month; the students have nothing to do with the Ministry. 
  Pursuant to the duties of the republic Procuracy, a number 
of 
rayon procurators made a selective inspection of the juridical 
acts of certain enterprises and organizations and agricultural 
and agroindustrial administrations subordinate to the Ministry. 
On the basis of the inspections, 114 juridical acts were 
protested as being illegal, 21 representations were submitted, 
and three reports were sent to local boards. 
  These and many other cases we have material on show clearly 
that in terms of ensuring the legality of juridical acts, the 
Ministry's work style and methods are unacceptable, and its 
practices are faulty and intolerable. 
  The practice of issuing illegal juridical acts is also 
fostered by the fact that most orders throughout the system are 
prepared without the participation of a juridical service. 
Orders are written by various officials and even by ordinary 
workers. They are not stamped by officials of these bureaus or 
even by ordinary legal staffers. Often, in fact, they are not 
even aware of the issuance of particular juridical acts. 
  The republic Procuracy has stated that the deplorable 
situation in the Ministry is giving rise to grave consequences 
and having a very destructive effect on the country's 
agroindustrial complex and the safeguarding of the legitimate 
interests of the state, society, and the citizen. In this 
connection, a representation has been submitted to the Ministry 
and the appropriate report has been sent to the Cabinet of 
Ministers.

  In accordance with intergovernmental agreements concluded by 
Russia with states which are former Union republics, a definite 
mechanism of trade-economic relations between them took shape 
and operated in 1993. The trade regimes, the volumes and 
conditions of mutual deliveries, and methods of tariff and 
nontariff regulation were defined. The creation of Russian trade 
representations in a number of states of the Commonwealth was 
envisioned. 
  Agreement was reached with virtually all the CIS states on 
employing a free trade regime. At the same time, however, an 
export tariff on certain goods, as an exception to the free 
trade regime, acted as a regulator of Russian export. Export 
duties are imposed on the export from Russia of food, mineral 
raw materials and fuel, ferrous and nonferrous metals, 
chemicals, timber and pulp and paper goods, leather and textile 
raw materials, aviation equipment, and weapons. Motor vehicles, 
equipment, and other output are exported duty free. On the 
whole, for most goods of Russian export on which export tariffs 
were imposed, duties were from 10 to 30 percent of the level of 
world prices for these goods. 
  The need to satisfy Russia's economic interests accounts for 
the existence of duties on goods exported from Russia to the CIS 
countries, since prices for many hard currency types of output 
on Russia's domestic market are lower than world prices. 
However, the decision was made to supply energy media from 
Russia at prices oriented to world prices. 
  Tariff and nontariff regulation of Russia's trade relations 
with the Commonwealth countries enabled trade exchange to be 
normalized and balanced. But the crisis situation in the 
economy, the drop in production, and the reorientation of 
enterprises' economic ties to the distant abroad caused Russia's 
trade turnover with the CIS states to continue to drop. The 
trade volume in 1993 totaled only 50 percent of the 1991 level. 
  The mechanism used to supply state needs for the major types 
of output and ensure mutual benefit in trade is a mechanism of 
equivalent deliveries on a balanced basis, which is figured on 
the basis of the price levels of the world market. In 1993, 
using this mechanism the overall trade turnover with the CIS 
countries totaled about 7 billion dollars. 
  In 1993 Russia had to regulate payment relations with the 
CIS 
states by instituting correspondent accounts of central 
(national) banks in the Central Bank of Russia. This prevented 
the uncontrolled release of circulating rubles into the Russian 
market, which was a powerful source of inflation in Russia. 
Payment-credit relations were also put in order and sums of 
technical credits granted by Russia were converted to state 
credits with liquidation conditions close to world conditions. 
  The debts of the CIS states owed to Russia which were 
converted to a state debt totaled R2.3 trillion (roughly 5 
billion U.S. dollars). And the possibility of paying off some of 
the debt by transferring property rights (stock, securities, and 
the like) to enterprises and objects which were of interest to 
Russia was envisioned at the same time. 
  Questions related to allowing payment-accounts relations 
between the states' enterprises is of definite significance in 
Russia's economic ties with the CIS countries. 
  At the end of 1993, the overall debt of enterprises and 
organizations of the CIS countries for goods supplied under 
direct ties from Russia totaled about R3.5 trillion, and of that 
roughly R1.5 trillion made up the debt to enterprises of 
Russia's fuel and energy complex. 
  (Above based on Goskomstat [Committee for State 
Statistics] of Russia data). 
  When the Issue Was Being Composed 
  The large debt of Ukraine and Belarus to Russia caused 
a number of serious problems with deliveries of natural gas to 
these republics. If the debts are not repaid in a very short 
amount of time, a substantial reduction in these deliveries is 
possible.

<H3>  Nonpayments Have Gone Beyond the Borders of Countries and

  By the start of 1994, overall creditor debts at enterprises 
of industry, construction, transport, and agriculture totaled 
R47.0 trillion. That included R16.4 trillion or 35 percent 
overdue. Debtor debts totaled R43.8 trillion, which included 
R18.1 trillion or 41 percent overdue. 
  Accounts with enterprises of the Russian Federation 
accounted 
for the largest part of the overdue creditor debts, R16.0 
trillion or 98 percent. Accounts with enterprises of the CIS and 
the Baltic Region under direct ties accounted for R0.3 trillion 
or 1.5 percent. 
  Overdue debtor debts under accounts between enterprises of 
the Russian Federation came out at R16.5 trillion, or 91 percent 
of its total amount. Overdue debts of enterprises located on the 
territory of the CIS countries and the Baltic Region under 
direct ties with enterprises of Russia totaled R0.6 trillion, or 
3.4 percent. 
  The following data characterize the condition of

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rogov, president of the National Security </F>
and International Relations Center: "The Near Abroad Is 
Interested in the Far Abroad: What Were the Reasons Behind 
Kravchuk's and Shevardnadze's Visits to Clinton"] 
  [Text] The recent visits to Washington by leaders of 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Georgia show that Washington's attitude 
toward the former Soviet republics is beginning to undergo a 
serious change. On the one hand, this stems from the fact that 
the conduits of American foreign policy have found out that a 
number of new independent states can play a visible role in the 
international arena. This comes first and foremost from these 
states' claims on entire components of the Soviet nuclear 
legacy. 
  Ukraine and Kazakhstan have demonstrated that they are in no 
hurry to fulfill their commitments to turn into non-nuclear 
states. The Lisbon protocol on nuclear arms, in keeping with 
which Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus were supposed to become 
non-nuclear states, remained unimplemented. A real prospect 
emerged of the former Soviet republics nationalizing not only 
conventional arms and armed forces, but also strategic nuclear 
arms. These arms would enable Ukraine and Kazakhstan to become 
major nuclear powers and to a certain extent (since 
intercontinental ballistic missiles on their territory were 
intended during the Soviet period for the conduct of war against 
the United States) to present a threat to the United States as 
well. 
  It was the realization of a possible development of events 
along this scenario that prompted the Clinton administration to 
develop a more active policy in this direction, using mostly 
"the carrot method." 
  One has to say that the leaders of Kazakhstan and Ukraine 
have been quite successful in using the United States' interest 
in resolving this issue to obtain the economic and political 
support they need and raise their status in the international 
arena. 
  In the case of Kazakhstan, President Nazarbayev's 
willingness 
to sign a nuclear nonproliferation treaty opened him the door to 
the White House. The Ukrainian position turned out more 
controversial. At the trilateral meeting of Presidents Clinton, 
Yeltsin, and Kravchuk in Moscow in January of this year, Ukraine 
reaffirmed its commitment to give up nuclear weapons, but has 
managed to successfully avoid precise formulae that would 
specify the time frame for making good on this commitment. It 
took additional efforts on the part of American diplomacy, 
including doubling the volume of economic aid that will be 
provided to Ukraine--to $700 million--to get President Kravchuk 
to give more precise assurances regarding keeping his old 
promises during his visit to Washington. 
  The second factor that compelled Washington to invite the 
leaders of several new independent states is the emergence of a 
sort of an instability belt on the territory of some former 
Soviet republics. Acute political conflicts and civil wars in a 
number of them are beginning to affect the international 
situation as a whole. These conflicts are taking place along 
with the bloody war in Yugoslavia and show that with the end of 
the Cold War a greater part of the former socialist countries 
may become seats of tension, undermining the stability of the 
entire system of international relations. 
  At the same time, Washington is very suspicious of Russia's 
attempts to take upon itself the functions of a guarantor of 
peace and stability in the CIS countries, including the use of 
military means. The participation of the Russian Armed Forces in 
peacekeeping operations in the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia, 
South Ossetia, and Tajikistan raises fears in Washington that 
our country may be trying to restore the empire. 
  Many American politicians demand of the Clinton 
administration to make it clear to Russia that restoration of 
the empire by force is impermissible. 
  Shevardnadze's visit to Washington is a testimony to the 
United States' willingness to take a more active position with 
respect to conflicts on the CIS territory, and in particular in 
the Transcaucasus. Such an approach may eventually produce 
considerable problems in Russian-American relations. After all, 
Russia today claims at an official level a "special role" in the 
CIS, proclaiming practically all the former Soviet republics a 
zone of its vitally important interests. Naturally, the entry of 
a third country into Russia's bilateral relations with Georgia 
or any other republic will be perceived in Moscow with great 
dismay, even if that third country is the United States, with 
which Russia is, as was announced at the latest summit, in a 
"mature strategic partnership." 
  Judging by all signs, there has emerged a considerable gap 
between the declarations of strategic partnership between Russia 
and the United States and the real mechanism of interaction 
between the two states, a mechanism for reaching agreement on 
their interests. It appears that this gap not only is not 
diminishing, but keeps growing, making relations between two 
former Cold War adversaries extremely fragile. As the scandal in 
connection with the arrest of the Ames family on the charges of 
espionage in Washington showed, despite assurances of strategic 
partnership, Russian-American relations may be turned back and 
enter a period of cooling and alienation. And the recent visits 
to Washington of the presidents of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and 
Georgia may present a cause for further complications in the 
relations between Moscow and Washington.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Russia and Uzbekistan Have Guaranteed </F>
Each Other to Observe the Rights of National Minorities"] 
  [Text] Yesterday in the Kremlin, Presidents Boris Yeltsin 
and Islam Karimov signed a declaration on the development and 
extension of all-encompassing cooperation between Russia and 
Uzbekistan. 
  In the document it is said, that "The Russian Federation and 
the Republic of Uzbekistan affirm their resolution unflinchingly 
to develop and extend all-encompassing cooperation in the 
interests of the peoples of both states, and to follow the 
course of reforming the economy and of democratic 
transformations." It is also affirmed in the declaration, that 
both states are striving to observe guarantees and the rights of 
national minorities, living both in Russia and in Uzbekistan. 
  Besides this, it is noted in the declaration, Russia and 
Uzbekistan are stiving to strengthen "the coordination of their 
external political activity for the consolidation of world peace 
and security, paying special attention in this to cooperation in 
the regulation of regional conflicts and other questions, 
touching on the interests of both states." Russia and Uzbekistan 
will establish, in particular, "a mechanism for consultations in 
the interests of insuring the security of the foreign borders of 
participating states of the CIS." 
  In the agreement signed by the heads of state about military 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Uzbekistan, the parties affirmed the important of agreement 
concluded on 15 May 1992 in Tashkent about collective security, 
and noted that "efforts to extend and perfect cooperation in the 
military sphere, and the development of the necessary legal 
basis for these goals," are continuing.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Fadin: "Argument of Pragmatists and </F>
Restorers: About Who Would Best Reintegrate the Former Union"] 
  [Text] Whereas for Gorbachev domestic policy was to a 
certain extent merely a part of his foreign policy, for Yeltsin 
it has of a particular moment been to some extent the reverse: 
Foreign policy has become a most important object of domestic 
political struggle. 
  The treaty with Georgia, the policy of restoration of the 
presence in the Balkans in the Bosnian crisis, the agreements 
with Belarus and Moldova--these are merely recent events that 
have been at the center of the political skirmishing. The harsh 
criticism of the government's steps on the part of a certain 
section of public opinion and the deputies might appear somewhat 
inappropriate, possibly, but only outside of the context of the 
actual struggle for power. After all, from the viewpoint of 
basic values and orientations the foreign policy of the 
"collective Yeltsin," in the "near abroad," at least, is hardly 
much different from the growing imperial mood of the Russian 
political class. 
  It needs to be clearly specified that we employ in this case 
the term "imperialism" and all that derives from it in a 
nonevaluative, "technical" sense--as a description of some 
complex reality of the hierarchical coexistence of ethno-state 
formations. In the particular sense (our short post-Soviet 
history affords ponderable grounds for this) that "empire means 
peace," and the "imperial" principle is objectively opposed to 
nationalism and signifies, at least, the preponderance of 
"nationalism of the soil" over "nationalism of blood." On the 
other hand, any pursuit of "national" (that is, state) interests 
by a great power inevitably incorporates such elements of the 
imperial principle as sphere of influence, sphere of special 
interests, and so forth. The great contemporary democracy, the 
United States, demonstrates a rational imperial policy in this 
sense. 
  In this sense the statement of service of neoimperial 
achievements of the regime is relatively impressive. Real 
military control over practically the entire territory of the 
former USSR has been preserved--in the sense that in no republic 
(the Baltic republics included) are there any foreign forces or 
military facilities other than Russian. The war in Tajikistan, 
the indefinite billeting of the 14th Army in the Dniester 
region, the presence of military bases in the Caucasus enshrined 
by agreements, the retention of the Black Sea Fleet, 
preservation of the nuclear monopoly on one-sixth of terra firma 
and military facilities and forces in the Baltic, real military 
control of the situation along the CIS perimeter, and pressure 
on its post-Soviet neighbors, increasingly effective on the 
whole, in favor of the introduction of dual citizenship--"what 
more do you want?" 
  The list could be continued, but even without this the story 
that Yeltsin is an agent inserted by the Politburo into the 
democratic movement for restoration of the USSR, which even 
recently seemed paradoxical, is becoming increasingly 
understandable. 
  The difference here between the positions of the "collective 
Yeltsin" and the opposition (if the Duma majority may be so 
called) remains fundamental. Whereas the opposition is oriented, 
in fact, toward the simple retention of the territories of the 
former empire (and in the unrealizable maximum, toward its 
restoration), the policy of the Yeltsin leadership is perfectly 
manifestly aimed at the neoimperial modernization of Russia's 
sphere of influence in the former USSR and contiguous countries, 
within the bounds of the objectively constricted possibilities 
of the present Russia, what is more. 
  If we are truly now observing the birth of Russian 
neoimperialism, a modernization of the sphere of Russia's 
interests in this logic would not signify either a restoration 
of the Soviet Union or an assembly of lands in the spirit of 
Ivan III. The "neo" suffix could mean primarily that influence 
should extend merely to the sphere of Russia's actual 
interests--military-political control, maintenance of the 
stability of interethnic relations, control over the main 
mineral resources, guardianship of local Russians, and so forth. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, this control would not 
entail the restoration either of the unity of the legal space or 
control over the extent of the powers of the local ruling elites 
or Moscow's former responsibility for maintaining a living 
standard in Uzbekistan, an infant-mortality rate in Azerbaijan 
or an educational level in Tajikistan somehow on a par with 
Russia. 
  Reality, however, is immeasurably more complex than our 
plans. The neoimperial trends in the policy of the Russian 
leadership are being manifested as a dotted line, residing 
alongside perfectly traditional approaches, which is strictly 
conditioned both by the pressure of the current crisis and the 
actual composition of the governing coalition. 
  The victory of the traditional industrial establishment in 
the government has afforded its leader, Oleg Soskovets, an 
opportunity to busy himself with restoration of the production 
engineering chains of Soviet industry currently severed among 
different states. The latter will be possible only with the 
restoration of the chains of the series of payments for orders, 
which have been severed today even more hopelessly than the 
production engineering chains, which, of course, is not so much 
an economic as a political matter--the main grounds for 
reconstitution of the ruble zone. 
  On the other hand, certain steps of the regime which seemed 
purely political (and even ideologically conditioned) have upon 
closer inspection an entirely material motivation. Participation 
in the civil war in Tajikistan is not simply a war for control 
over territory of the former USSR but also an aspiration to plug 
a hole on the border, the existence of which would require far 
greater outlays on the reconstitution of a nontransparent 
Russian border proper, and Tajikistan's admittance to the ruble 
space is the actual charge for this. And so forth. 
  Let us not forget either the interests of Russian big 
business, the "sharks" of which have learned to defend their 
interests with the cudgel of the Russian Government. The 
Azerbaijani Government had only to attempt to organize a 
consortium for the development of oil deposits without the 
participation of Russian corporations for the Karabakh army to 
tear toward the Iranian border, occupying a further two areas of 
the country. The Lukoyl concern had to be urgently included in 
the consortium, after which the Azerbaijani Army was able to 
restore the lost territories in the course of a 
counteroffensive.... 
  On the other hand, the motives of the regime's active policy 
in the near abroad are partially, truly, of the nature of a 
reaction to intra-Russian circumstances. The ideological vacuum 
in which the regime has found itself following the exhaustion of 
the potential of the liberal-market utopia is forcing it to seek 
ideological support in the deep-lying seams of the mass 
consciousness, which is in Russia imperial by nature. 
Essentially, under the conditions of the continuing unfolding of 
the economic crisis, only opposition to some external enemy can 
secure for Yeltsin powerful mass support within the country on 
the eve of presidential elections. 
  In turn, it is just as necessary for the opposition to 
portray Yeltsin's foreign policy as insufficiently imperial, 
capitulationist, ideally. In the political struggle the 
arguments are directed not toward the opposite side but toward 
the public--and are not, therefore, required to be just. A 
deplorable illustration of this trivial observation were the 
closed hearings in the Duma CIS Committee devoted to the treaty 
with Georgia which had been signed not long before this. 
  B. Pastukhov, deputy minister of foreign affairs, and 
representatives of other government departments, who presented 
the treaty in the committee, attempted to show that the treaty 
was in Russia's strategic interests, that Russia's departure 
from Georgia would signify the filling of the vacated niche by 
other powers, and that support for Shevardnadze was the best 
decision for Russia at this time. 
  But the deputies' criticism of the treaty was of a clearly 
anti-Yeltsin and, consequently, anti-Georgian nature. 
Accusations against the Georgian (!) side that it had violated 
the Sochi agreements and had endeavored to obtain Russian 
weapons to threaten its neighbors were heard. It was proposed 
that Russia not guarantee Georgia's integrity but act as an 
arbiter, as it were, between Tbilisi and the autonomies, that 
is, de facto constantly keep its hand on the throat of the 
Georgian state. The proposal for the drawing of a permanent line 
of demarcation in South Ossetia along the line of the actual 
control of the Russian forces (that is, de facto annexation of 
part of the territory) was heard also. 
  It is not important who personally gave voice to these 
sentiments--they are manifestly dominant in the political class 
and in society. A sociological survey of the Public Opinion 
Foundation on the attitude toward Belarus's affiliation to the 
ruble zone showed that a substantial portion of the Russian 
population is prepared to forgo to some extent its own living 
standard even for the sake of preserving a unified post-Soviet 
space. 
  Criticism of the policy of the regime in the "near abroad" 
remains, in fact, within the framework of values common to both 
those doing the criticizing and the criticized. It is more a 
struggle between those nostalgic for the irrevocable Soviet 
times of Moscow's full control over the republics and those 
who--intuitively, perhaps--are attempting to operate within the 
framework of the new sociopolitical and geopolitical realities.

<F P=106> [Article by Maryana Oliynyk: "Things are fine with the </F>
Finns, but what about us?"] 
  [Text]The sensational news about Zhirinovsky's 
triumph in Russia overshadowed, as some political pundits noted, 
the equally sensational victories of the `Women of Russia' bloc. 
Contrary to skeptical predictions, the bloc received almost nine 
percent of the votes, coming close to the performance of LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], Russian Choice and the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Will Ukrainian women 
do as well? 
  Let us begin by examining the relationship of women to 
politics. First, consider some numbers in the report `Women in 
Ukraine: A Political Portrait', prepared by Lyudmyla Aza and 
Lidiya Kononko. This report summarized the results of a national 
poll conducted last May and June by the Center for Democratic 
Initiatives; the center polled 1799 persons, 54% of them 
women. 
  The poll showed that, contrary to popularly held views, the 
gentle sex is just as interested in politics as men. True, only 
7.3% of the women attend political meetings; twice as 
many men 
go to such meetings and three times as many men go to political 
conventions. However, women have been shown to be more 
influential and are much better at communication and public 
relations. 
  The poll further revealed that 83% of the women 
participate 
in political discussions and 78% claim an abiding 
interest in 
political issues 
  Finally, the poll indicated that 46.6% of the women 
do not 
trust the current parliament and 41.9% mistrust the 
government. 
The corresponding figures for men were 55.2 and 46.4% but, 
after all, we women are more trusting. This may be interpreted 
to mean that women want a change. This poll was quite 
selective--1677 of the respondents came from Kiev and 102 from 
other cities--but revealed that equal numbers of men and 
women--52%--have decided to vote. Other revelations were 
that 
35% of the women and 29% of the men will not vote, 
and 13% of 
the women and 19% of the men remain undecided. 
  In selecting candidates for office 49.8% of the 
women felt 
that they should be proposed by workers' collectives, 
26.3% 
think that they should come from the electoral districts where 
they live, and 10.5% feel they should be nominated by 
political 
parties, although they are mistrusted by 64.4% of the 
women 
polled (and 63.2% of the men). Nevertheless, women are 
prepared 
to support those parties and social groups that support women's 
issues. Evidence for this can be gleaned from the results in 
Russia where the `Women of Russia" bloc brought together the 
Union of Russian Women, Union of Women Entrepreneurs, and Union 
of Army and Navy Women. The `Women of Russia' bloc is not a 
political party as such and has no political ambitions. Alevtina 
Fedulova, the leader of `Women of Russia', has never portrayed 
herself as a president of Russia. Nevertheless, `women of 
Russia" attracted women with an understanding of women's issues 
and problems. As noted by one journalist, the liberal-democratic 
party "Men of Russia" attracted support from young men 
terrorized by the need to earn a living with promises to 
eliminate this evil threat. The purpose of `Women of Russia" was 
simply to give hope to women that someone was concerned about 
them in that male-dominated world. 
  The poll also demonstrated that political and legal 
awareness 
is generally low in both men and women: 60.2% of the 
women in 
the poll could not differentiate between majority, proportional 
or mixed electoral systems. Nevertheless, interest in politics 
is growing despite these obstacles. 
  The study also put to rest the impression that only lonely 
women without a full life are interested in politics. Marital 
status did not influence interest in politics, and the latter 
was not a substitute for a family life. Family responsibilities 
and concerns for the future of their children actually provided 
a stimulus for political activity, an observation confirmed by 
the conference of women's organizations held in Kiev at the 
beginning of February. 
  The fact that such a conference took place--the first of its 
kind--speaks volumes. Participants in the conference included 
The Women's Union, Union of the Ukrainian Women, All-Ukrainian 
Committee for Child Care, the League of Mothers and Sisters of 
Soldiers, Ukrainian Women's Christian Party, Union of Soldiers' 
Mothers, Ukrainian Center for Women's Studies, Union of 
Multiparous Mothers, the Kremenchuk organization Our Home, and 
so forth. They discussed such critical issues as low pay, high 
prices, child health, life experiences, and the hopelesness of 
waiting for help from the `strong sex'. President Kravchuk's 
message to the conference contained the following sentiments: 
"Today, as we are engaged in state-building, Ukraine's future 
rests--without doubt--on the willpower, wisdom, and committment 
of our women!" As the consummate gentlemen, President Kravchuk 
wanted to please the ladies. But his words found fertile ground, 
the stage was set, and the women decided to present a unified 
political front in the upcoming elections. 
  A special seminar was held on selecting a slate of 
candidates 
for parliament. Current laws preclude social organizations from 
proposing candidates, but they were proposed with support from 
workers' collectives and groups of voters. For example, the 
Union of Ukrainian Women fielded more than 60 candidates, 
including its leader Maria Orlyk. Although the final figures are 
not in, out of some 5833 candidates the number of women is 
small. The female contingent includes deputy Larysa Skoryk, the 
authoress Rayisa Ivanchenko, the lawyer Lyudmyla Vansovska, and 
a number of scientists, entrepreneurs, politicians and so on. 
  In the historical sense, the Ukrainian woman has always been 
enjoyed a place of importance. When did she lose her leading 
role and how? 
  It seems the problem begins early in life. Initially girls 
assume leadership roles and do better in school than boys, but 
in time they are relegated to the back burners as they grow 
older and the social structures become more complex. Women are 
deprived of the experience and skills to advance and are limited 
to participation in the `women's movement', which elicits ironic 
complaints about `emancipation'. Still, women are allowed to 
engage in heavy physical work by the `stronger sex', its just 
that the rarefied atmosphere of high-level politics is out of 
bounds. 
  In the final analysis, women are faced with a struggle to 
regain what they lost. 
  Moreover, the concept of a `women's movement' seems somehow 
demeaning. Why is there no need for a `men's movement'? 
  The concept of quotas for women in elective offices is also 
denigrating. I agree 100% with Levko Lukyanenko who 
categorically rejected parliamentary quotas for women in favor 
of fair competition. Men have to learn to accept women who are 
politicians, directors, experts and not treat them as rare 
exceptions for whom special allowances must be made. During 
Soviet rule quotas were set for women and women simply copied 
and reflected male norms in politics. This paternalistic 
attitude must change and room made for the more caring and 
nurturing `maternal' milieu. 
  As one speaker at the conference noted, women must not 
simply 
fill positions allocated to them, but actively seek the highest 
reaches of leadership. Women and men need to combine their 
forces, energies and talents for the common good. One can 
understand why our present parliament--with only 13 women--often 
finds itself in a dead end. In Russia the creation of the `Women 
of Russia bloc has been called--by women, of course--the most 
important and positive development in recent times. Countries in 
which women hold a high political profile, such as the United 
States, Canada and the Scandinavian countries, enjoy stability 
and have better economies, health care, and social services. In 
Finland even the minister of defense is a woman, a thing hard to 
imagine happening here. She--Elisabeth Rehn--ran for the 
presidency of Finland and almost won against Martti Ahtisaari. 
Nevertheless, her defeat is still interpreted as a great moral 
victory for the Finnish people since it demonstrated that 
politicians are judged on their abilities and not sex or 
nationality (Ren is a member of Swedish National Part of 
Finland). A day after the presidential elections the Finnish 
parliament elected a 51 year old woman as its speaker, Riitta 
Uosukainen, a representative of the Conservative Coalition Party 
and minister of education, while Saara-Marja Paakkinen, a social 
democrat, was elected the first deputy speaker. There is a large 
number of women in the 200 member Finnish parliament and about a 
third of the government posts are occupied by women. 
  That is the way things are in Finland. Unfortunately, not 
too 
much can be expected from our elections on March 27. Our women 
lack the organization that the Russian women have created and 
our people lack the open-mindedness of Finns. Still, we can look 
toward the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Larisa Skorik, candidate for deputy of the </F>
Supreme Council of Ukraine, by NOVOYE VREMYA correspondent 
Georgiy Osipov, special for NOVOYE VREMYA; place and date not 
given: "Larisa Skorik: `I Wish Kravchuk Would Be Firmer'"] 
  [Text] Our correspondent Georgiy Osipov has discussed 
problems of Ukrainian statehood with the "Iron Lady" of 
Kiev. 
  Doctor of Architecture Larisa Skorik came to politics five 
years ago with the "perestroyka" wave, and has been one of the 
10 leading politicians of Ukraine ever since. She, the only 
woman in the political establishment of Kiev, has once again 
joined the election race: Parliamentary elections will be held 
in Ukraine on 27 March. 
  [Osipov] Larisa Pavlovna, as far as I know, you now have a 
lot of much more "eternal" business than current politics--the 
construction of several churches you have designed, students at 
the Art Institute, and, finally, three grandchildren.... 
Nonetheless, you are once again in the whirlwind of the 
political fight. What drives you? 
  [Skorik] We recall 100 times a day a dictum by Ivan Franko, 
who said that if something is to be done for the people, after 
all, then it should be out of a feeling of duty rather than out 
of love, because apparently there is nothing for which to love 
the people in their entire postcommunist variety. I feel that I 
must engage in politics and can do something genuine in the 
corridors of power, which few people are determined enough to 
walk to the end. During these four years I have completely lost 
all fear; my political rating is of absolutely no interest to 
me, and I allow myself to say things that may affect my 
political image quite adversely. 
  However, there is also such a thing as love for the lofty 
spiritual concept which is the driving force of all of my 
actions, which is called the statehood of the Ukrainian nation. 
  [Osipov] To your mind, what must be done for this abstract 
notion to acquire visible, specific features? 
  [Skorik] What is happening now in politics almost does not 
reflect what is happening "within." Look at Russia: A bitter 
power struggle is underway there, but there are no political 
forces that would have an unfavorable attitude toward the very 
notion of Russia as an independent state, whereas in Ukraine a 
majority in the parliament is almost hostile to the fact of the 
existence of Ukrainian statehood. 
  For many years the thirst for Ukrainian statehood was 
thoroughly suppressed in our society. This thirst is merely 
beginning to come back to one segment of the population, whereas 
the other is at best indifferent to the national idea. I am 
referring to the almost 10 million population in Ukraine whom 
Moscow has branded "the Russian-speaking population," and whose 
rights Russia, in keeping with its military doctrine, intends to 
defend at any point on the globe. It is not surprising that they 
gravitate somewhat toward Russia. 
  I often recall General Yermolov's words to the effect that 
fortresses are not taken by assault but rather by intrigue and 
bribery within. I see Ukraine as a fortress that they wish to 
re-annex to the empire in precisely such ways--certainly, 
peaceful ways! I think that this will not benefit either the 
"elder brother" or the "younger brother." 
  [Osipov] In Kiev I have already repeatedly heard from all 
kinds of people who sincerely feel for an independent Ukraine 
that the current "party of power" has managed to compromise the 
very idea of Ukrainian statehood for many years to come.... 
  [Skorik] These people are naive, although sincere. Many of 
those whom they mention unfavorably, including the speaker of 
the current Supreme Council Ivan Plyushch, are possessed solely 
by the instincts of their own lust for power, and are by no 
means bound by the idea of Ukrainian statehood. As far as the 
idea of Ukrainian statehood is concerned, it is impossible to 
compromise it for the simple reason that we have barely begun to 
implement it. 
  [Osipov] What would you like the Ukrainian state to be? 
  [Skorik] Europeans see the state as a protector of their own 
originality rather than a transgressor against it. This is 
precisely what I would like an independent Ukraine to be, 
because by all indicators it gravitates toward Europe rather 
than toward Asia, despite the fact that this feeling of 
belonging in Europe was thoroughly suppressed for many years. 
  In purely political terms, I see Ukraine as a presidential 
republic, not a presidential-parliamentary republic, because all 
our woes are rooted in this mix, but precisely presidential. The 
president should appoint the prime minister and form an 
effective government, rather than the Supreme Council with its 
comical notions of its powers. Separation of power should exist 
only at the highest, statewide level, whereas all other levels 
should be permeated by strong presidential power. 
  [Osipov] To your mind, on what does the greatness of a 
particular state hinge at present? 
  [Skorik] As I see it, on the percentage ratio of the entire 
mass of society and its elite; the higher the percentage of the 
elite, the greater the state may believe itself to be. To me, 
the elite is not just the intelligentsia; it is the people who 
have a highly developed feeling of their own dignity, they 
excel, they are virtuosos, if you will, in all endeavors, no 
matter what social stratum they belong to. However, the 
Ukrainian elitist tradition is not continuous. For many years 
the Ukrainian elite, like, say, the Georgian, Lithuanian, or 
Latvian, worked to create the Russian elite. 
  [Osipov] You were born in Galicia, which has always played 
an 
absolutely special role in the political and cultural life of 
Ukraine. How do you see this role at present? 
  [Skorik] About 40, and perhaps even 20 years ago, Galicia 
was 
a Ukrainian Piemonte of sorts. It held a particular position in 
terms of the level of national awareness and weight of the elite 
which I have already mentioned in its society. Galicia was 
considered to be the guardian of the Ukrainian spirit. This was 
due to the relative proximity of Europe and the almost 100 years 
of contacts with the cultured, developed, and, by the standards 
of its time, even relatively democratic state which was the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
  However, the last useless decades have left an imprint on 
Galicia, too. I, a native Galician who has by now lived half of 
my life in Kiev, feel it particularly keenly. I am alarmed about 
people who have come to power there during the time of the 
latest changes, who call themselves democrats and who, not being 
such at all, have quite successfully compromised the idea of 
democracy rather than the idea of Ukrainian statehood. Galicians 
have been disappointed in the local authorities, but at the same 
time, they say deliberately: We are prepared to endure a great 
many things as long as we are certain that our state will not be 
betrayed, will not be lost, and will not be reduced to slavery 
again. 
  On the whole, I believe that Ukraine is one and indivisible, 
and I think that the division into Eastern and Western Ukraine, 
into Novorossiya, will disappear soon. 
  [Osipov] At one time you proceeded hand in hand with many 
politicians of a democratic orientation--your fellow Galicians. 
Please recall the case of Stepan Khmara, who was seized in 
November 1990 in an underground crossing at Independence Square 
(at the time, it was still the Square of the October Revolution) 
for allegedly attacking a militia functionary. You defended 
Khmara even when the OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] 
stormed his hotel room. Khmara now says that he has two 
opponents in the elections--the communists and Larisa Skorik.... 
  [Skorik] I have long known that Stepan Khmara is a person 
very different from myself; however, that feeling of duty, which 
stands above everything in my life, except for love of 
architecture and art, prompted me to defend him as "our" man. At 
the time, Khmara played the role of an innocently victimized 
national hero, which was very flattering to him and suited him 
very much. However, at the same time, the "Khmara affair" gave 
the authorities of the time a pretext to mount an attack against 
our entire democratic camp, by then quite extensive and 
relatively steadfast. I continued to fight when everybody had 
grown tired of manifestations and court proceedings and 
abandoned the struggle for Khmara's liberation. It was just that 
I needed to win this case for the overall democratic bloc. The 
personality of Stepan himself has never been a mystery to me, 
but at the time, he was one of our people. 
  [Osipov] One can also frequently hear it said about you that 
you have betrayed the overall democratic cause, gone over to the 
side of Leonid Kravchuk, and generally changed very much as a 
politician during the last two years.... 
  [Skorik] I have not changed one iota during these years. It 
is just that I am an advocate of statehood, and the building of 
a Ukrainian state is the objective and foundation for my 
political activities. Everything was very clear and precise when 
things that were preventing the budding statehood from gaining 
strength had to be swept out of the way. 
  When revolutions end, it is necessary to act in a different 
way. My relationship with Leonid Kravchuk did not get anywhere 
as long as he belonged to the Communist Party and headed the 
Supreme Council of a state belonging to the USSR. However, after 
the famous State Committee for the State of Emergency, he sensed 
that the [Ukrainian] state could become a reality. Kravchuk is 
not one to rattle his saber in vain. When I ascertained that of 
his actions were aimed at preservation of an independent 
Ukrainian state, I supported him. Moreover, no matter what my 
relationship with someone is, I am prepared to support everyone 
who acts to the benefit of the Ukrainian state. 
  I just laugh when our ultrapatriots or communists say that 
Kravchuk betrays the interests of the Ukrainian state. If so, 
why did he have to introduce the national currency, begin the 
building of the Ukrainian army, and refrain from signing the CIS 
Charter? Was it in order to bring Ukraine into a new Soviet 
Union on a new, Susanin-like path? 
  Incidentally, Mr. Zhirinovskiy has also acknowledged the 
credit due our president by saying that Kravchuk, who broke 
apart the USSR, is the very first person who should be destroyed 
in Ukraine. 
  If his activities begin to proceed in a different direction, 
I will undoubtedly join the ranks of his most categorical and 
intransigent opponents. Building a state is not like playing 
games; this calls for political maturity, a cool mind, and 
substantial training. It is a great pity that such politicians 
are extremely few among those who habitually call themselves 
democrats. 
  [Osipov] Will the situation in Ukraine change for the better 
after the elections of the parliament and the president? 
  [Skorik] I do not have any doubt that the new Supreme 
Council 
will be better than the present one, because it is impossible to 
conceive of it being worse. It will most likely be quite 
different, it will have a quite different sentiment--to not 
interfere with absolutely everything, from the dismissal of 
ministers to the appointment of joint-stock company directors, 
but instead to form firm executive structures. 
  To my mind, presidential elections are absolutely not needed 
at present: I do not see a single worthy candidate among those 
who crave the presidency. Being the president of Ukraine is an 
unenviable lot, and I would wish that Leonid Kravchuk would be a 
bit more decisive and firm in building a new system of power.

GAZETA: "Ukraine: `A Savior of the Fatherland' Is Needed"] 
  [Text] Leonid Kravchuk's announcement of his 
unwillingness to put forth his candidacy in the July 
presidential elections has evoked numerous interpretations and 
absolutely contradictory accusations on the part of political 
opponents. 
  The current situation is really not too clear and definite. 
The Supreme Council is awaiting its own reelection. Perhaps 
those 194 deputies who proposed their own candidacies for a new 
term are exactly the ones who constitute its capable nucleus. 
Because those who want to be reelected have the best chances of 
this today: It is not so much that people are yearning for 
changes for the better as that they are afraid that things might 
get worse. In the event the elections are not held, the old 
staff will hardly be able to work for several reasons: as 
morally antiquated, the continuous lack of a quorum, and in 
connection with inadequate representative political forces. 
  There should be no place for illusions regarding its 
participation and the current composition of the government that 
is headed by a temporarily acting premier. Finally, after Leonid 
Kravchuk's announcement, serious doubts have surfaced about the 
reliability of and prospects for the president's vertical chain 
of command. State authority in its full structure attested to 
its temporariness, which is analogous to an acknowledgment of 
its ineffectiveness already today. 
  The impression is being created that all the participants of 
the long and exhaustive struggle for the real levers of control 
that was waged from the day of acquisition of independence have 
simultaneously become deathly sick of each other and of 
themselves and, therefore, have said in typical Ukrainian 
philosophical manner: "Go to hell!" 
  As a matter of fact, moral fatigue is truly a dominating 
factor at all stages of Ukrainian post-Soviet society. But 
according to physical and metaphysical laws, the obvious 
cessation of the struggle and movement denotes only their 
transition to new forms. Thus, the present political entropy 
which, it seems, even the political campaign is not in a 
condition to stop, may, in our opinion, have two explanations. 
  It is possible we are observing the last stage in the 
building of a national state in the style of the well-known 
anecdote about how it was recommended that a Ukrainian be a 
tsar: He ate one goody after another, loaded up on goodies, 
stole 100 rubles [R], and ran away. That this happens with an 
inexperienced and dispirited elite was shown to me not only by 
our historical experience, but also by a parade of objections to 
sovereignty that started in Minsk, the capital of the CIS. It is 
difficult to judge how much the Ukrainian nomenklatura and 
directorate matured before returning under the influence of the 
Moscow boss, but the program provisions of the Kuchma-Grinev 
bloc talk of a readiness to go the Belarusian way. Under these 
conditions, Kravchuk should take the lessons of Shushkevich into 
account and be concerned that catapulting from a doomed aircraft 
should occur with the necessary solemnity and caution. 
  The second version of that which prompted Kravchuk to make a 
"move with the knight" lies in the recognition that the domestic 
political factor and not the foreign factor is decisive. The 
struggle for the Ukrainian mace is not ending, but it is 
undergoing a certain transformation. New rules in this case are 
being written for new players. 
  The popularity rating of Ukrainian politicians "tolls" the 
collapse of the political system. When not one of them is able 
to count on the trust of at least a fifth of the population, it 
becomes understandable why there is no elementary order in the 
country. The existing situation is a consequence, first of all, 
of the defeat of the old nomenklatura, which in the person of 
the president received exceptionally authoritative powers two 
years ago. The fact that Leonid Kravchuk in the matter of trust 
actually was the equivalent of his primary competitor, 
Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the people's Rukh [Ukrainian 
People's Movement for Perestroyka], and former Prime Minister 
Leonid Kuchma is a very alarming symptom for the "party in 
power" that he heads. This means that the categories of national 
intelligentsia and economic managers of the middle echelon that 
are traditionally under control are coming out from under the 
heel of the nomenklatura and, very likely, will seek an 
alternative source of power. 
  It is interesting that the one and same nomenklatura in an 
almost unchanged personnel structure has already suffered defeat 
twice before our eyes--first under the guise of the communists, 
and later also under the sign of the national-democrats. 
  In addition, the righteous anger of the "fathers of the 
nation," who in both cases consecrated the ruling structure with 
their lyrical-epic talent, looks rather comical. The 
participants of the so-called Assembly of the Intelligentsia of 
the City of Kiev held on 26 February frequently drew an analogy 
with the first Rukh congress, which occurred in the very same 
House of the Cinema four years ago. The former passion returned 
to the leaders of national-democracy (chairmen were Ivan Drach, 
Les Tanyuk, and Levko Lukyanenko), and once again one could hear 
summons for a decisive struggle with the "occupying 
administration," but the populist audience did not bring this 
out of a state of deep inertness. 
  There are other attitudes and other problems in the 
corridors 
of power. President Leonid Kravchuk and Chairman of the Supreme 
Council Ivan Plyushch cannot cope with their competitors in a 
direct sense. They only represent different administrative 
models. Kravchuk tried to conduct a strict executive vertical 
chain of command that would possess the public levers of 
influence and rely on the authority of the nationally elected 
president. However, it is difficult to impart the norms of an 
open society to our society, and especially to the officialdom 
of the lower and middle echelons. 
  But this is exactly the sphere of Ivan Plyushch's 
competence, 
the master of the apparatus game and concealed control levers. 
The amorphous system of the representative organs is the best 
ground for the nomenklatura coverup, with which the idea of 
state power is traditionally identified in our country. 
  However, this is by no means a reason for quarrels between 
Leonid Makarovych and Ivan Stepanovych. They have common 
corporate interests and different spheres of realization of 
personal ambitions. This means that common decisions are not 
only possible, but also natural. It is precisely this that the 
statement of the president should indicate. It is difficult to 
guess what his true intentions are now. 
  In the logic of events, both the new membership of 
parliament 
and the new president, who could be elected in the current 
situation, should win authority with a sharp negation of the 
existing regime. Therefore, both these and other elections for 
the "party in power," let us put it this way, are not opportune. 
At the same time, it is impossible to disrupt them openly, as 
this puts the cards in the hands of the opposition. It is better 
to "let it drop." 
  All of this evoked a new wave of emotions and a new stream 
of 
reproaches. This time Kravchuk is accused by all sides of a lack 
of political will and betrayal of national interests. But at the 
same time public opinion, imperceptibly to itself, is already 
beginning to perceive the far from indisputable claims of the 
president as an objective reality, and the problem of elections 
falls by itself... 
  Kravchuk's statement literally has forced everyone to look 
into the abyss: By it the chaos and fragility of the political 
situation have been brought to a culmination. And this is an 
ideal condition for the appearance of a savior of the fatherland.

<F P=106> [Article by Yaroslav Falko, Zaporizhzhya: "The Motor-Sich </F>
Aircraft Engine Plant Has Converted To Producing Ukrainian 
People's Deputies"] 
  [Text] Adhering to a long-time Zaporyzhzhyan 
conviction--The more atamans [chiefs] there are, the better it 
is for the Cossacks--the voters in this oblast put up more than 
200 candidates for the office of people's deputy; that is almost 
15 candidates for each of the 18 election districts. And in the 
Sich, at the very heart of European-type democracy--the 
Leninskyy Rayon of Zaporizhzhya--the electoral commission 
registered as many as 30 candidates. More than 100 persons had 
originally been put up there. One contender has already died.... 
The activists in election matters complain that most of the 
candidates cannot even write up their own biographical sketches 
without making mistakes. They need to work on their A,B,C's.... 
  An analysis of the pre-election lists leads us inevitably to 
the following conclusion, which may seem paradoxical at first 
glance: The nomenklatura of the local power structure has, in 
effect, withdrawn itself from contention for the deputies' 
seats. Not a single presidential representative is on the 
ballot, nor are any chairmen of local or rayon councils. Not 
even those bureaucratic officials of the state administration, 
who have not withstood the temptation to scamper off to Kiev, 
have any desire to beat their own bosses soundly. In a country 
where elections are won by the group that organizes them such 
behavior in Zaporizhzhya by the "party of Kravchuk" and the 
"party of Plyushch" must seem surprising at the least. However, 
their tactics may be easily explained: The nomenklatura here 
does not wish to win the elections; it intends instead to lose 
them. And that certainly does not require much effort. Inasmuch 
as an outright victory by any one candidate on the ballot in 
Zaporizhzhya seems highly doubtful in the first round, the 
second round could indeed put an end to these elections with all 
the hustle and bustle around them. The people in Zaporizhzhya 
might very well ignore their obligation to go somewhere and vote 
for someone for a second week in a row. And unless two-thirds of 
the body of deputies has been elected after these two rounds, 
the elections may be deemed a political nullity. In that case 
the present-day Supreme Council would automatically continue its 
powers of office--an eventuality which would fully suit the 
nomenklatura of Plyushch and Kravchuk. At present they are more 
concerned with the elections to the local councils--elections 
for which they must, indeed, prepare. And in order to prepare, 
they need a time-out.... 
  Under such conditions the deputies' seats will be divided up 
amongst themselves virtually without a struggle by the agrarians 
and the clan of industrialists (if, indeed, the elections take 
place at all). Judging from how very carefully the card game of 
solitaire for the election districts has been laid out from the 
"left-wingers," it has become understood that these elections 
are being directed from a single center. This center is, without 
a doubt, the headquarters staff of the "party of 
industrialists"--the gigantic Motor-Sich Aircraft Engine Plant, 
which is headed up by General Director V'yacheslav Bohuslayev, 
who is also president of the Inter-Regional Association of 
Industrialists. This association combines the industrial 
structures of seven oblasts in the southern and eastern portions 
of Ukraine. It claims the status of an independent organization, 
although--at the same time--it is contriving to join up with the 
Ukrainian Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. 
  It is interesting that the largest party organization in 
Zaporizhzhya--the Labor Party--which was created, incidentally, 
by the above-mentioned Inter-Regional Association of 
Industrialists--put up only four persons as candidates. This 
party's leaders have taken a different path. Taking note of the 
fact that Zaporyzhzhyans have traditionally leaned toward 
communists and socialists and that the Labor Party is little 
known by the "work collective," they have recruited a large 
number of recent party organizers from various enterprises. 
  Zaporizhzhya is probably the weakest link in the 
Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. Leonid Kuchma is regarded quite 
coolly here, especially because he chose Volodymyr Hrynyov as an 
ally. Furthermore, the Zaporizhzhyan industrialists have their 
own influential leader--the above-mentioned director of 
Motor-Sich, Bohuslayev, who has laid claim to primacy throughout 
the entire southern region of Ukraine. As we have learned from 
the corridors of political power, after Fokin's resignation, 
Bohuslayev's name--along with that of Kuchma--was prominent in 
the lists of contenders for the position of prime minister. 
  With regard to Volodymyr Hrynyov, he is an extremely 
unpopular person in Zaporizhzhya--regardless of the fact that 
this oblast is a Russian-speaking one, i.e., with quite a high 
percentage of ethnic Russians. It is noteworthy that, when he 
ran for the office of president, Hrynyov garnered less than 1.5 
percent of the votes. He is not supported either by the 
Zaporizhzhyan entrepreneurs or by the industrialists. Volodymyr 
Hrynyov intends to rely on the president of the Zaporizhzhyan 
Commodity Exchange, Kalika, although it seems the he does not 
have very much support from that quarter either. 
  The national-democratic parties have virtually no chances in 
Zaporizhzhya. They lack any dazzling, charismatic leaders. The 
overwhelming majority of them live by old slogans, which are 
quaint and ridiculous in the environment where the average 
Zaporizhzhyan citizen lives. If in the Kam'yansko-Dniprovskyy 
Rayon victory is gained by the candidate from Energodar--the 
site of the Zaporyzhzhyan nuclear specialists, in the 
Komunarskyy Rayon of the oblast center--by the Zaporizhzhyan 
capitalist, Petro Saboshuk, and in the Leninskyy Rayon of 
Zaporizhzhya--by the leader of the parliamentary faction of the 
PDVU [Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], Ukrainian 
People's Deputy Serhiy Sobolev, then it can be considered that 
the national-democrats will have succeeded in gaining 3 out of 
the 18 seats involved here. The remainder of the "travel passes" 
to the Supreme Council will be divided up approximately equally 
among the "party of the state directors" and the agrarians. By 
the way, that is also the present-day composition of the 
Zaporizhzhyan body of deputies.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Oliynyk: "The Ukrainian Emigrant. Who </F>
Is He?"] 
  [Text] "A conservative mentality and the fact that 
they are unaccustomed to travelling far from home will probably 
keep Ukrainians from leaving the country en masse as long as 
they are not forced to do so by extraordinary circumstances. 
This does not, however, exclude the possibility of a rise in 
mass migration in the future, if Ukraine's living standard 
remains lower than that of other countries." "The Emigration of 
the Population of Ukraine: Socioeconomic Aspects and Possible 
Consequences," scientific report by the National Institute for 
Strategic Studies, December 1993. 
<H3>  WHY ARE PEOPLE PACKING THEIR SUITCASES? BLAME THE CRISIS... 
AND JOURNALISTS </H3>
  The economic crisis is responsible for the fact that lately 
more and more Ukrainians are packing their suitcases in order to 
make a break for the West. Sociologists, however, also explain 
this as a reaction to the earlier ban on travel, as well as the 
effect of propaganda in the mass media, which has replaced the 
harsh criticism of "their way of life" with something 
approximating idealization, thereby creating new ideals in the 
consciousness of Ukrainians. 
  Yet the underlying reason for emigration is the fact that 
the 
living standard of our countrymen is significantly lower than of 
people in neighboring countries. Given that the average wage 
here is no more than 10 dollars per month, that the social 
guarantee of housing that existed in the period of "developed 
socialism" no longer exists, and that hyperinflation reigns, 
most potential emigrants are now giving thought not only to 
their prosperity but also to the prospects of having a job a 
year or two from now. 
  Last year, the number of unemployed people in Ukraine 
increased tenfold, and this takes into account only those who 
have registered officially. Both Ukrainian and foreign experts 
predict that there may be rom two to three million jobless in 
Ukraine by 1995. 
  Ecological problems also stimulate emigration; the Chernobyl 
catastrophe encompassed a territory populated by three million 
inhabitants. People who were forced to abandon their homes are 
quick to decide to leave the country forever. 
  When we compare the results of sociological studies 
conducted 
in 1990 with those conducted in 1992-93, we find that, 
unfortunately, the desire to emigrate is growing among the 
population of Ukraine. According to a survey conducted by the 
International Migration Organization, 83 percent of respondents 
in Ukraine cited worsening living conditions during the last 
three years (67 percent in Russia), and nearly the same 
proportion of respondents do not believe that the situation will 
improve in the near future. The most troubling aspect of these 
statistics is that one-third of those surveyed who are planning 
to emigrate is comprised of young people, who give as their 
reason for leaving their inability to realize their potential in 
Ukraine. This attitude is especially widespread among people 
under 20 years of age (41 percent), the intelligentsia (42 
percent), and students (40 percent). 
  As part of a wider study, researchers conducted short 
interviews with people who were leaving the country at railroad 
and airline ticket counters and outside the embassies of the 
United States, Germany, Israel, and Russia. Nearly 90 percent of 
those surveyed said they were prompted to emigrate or leave the 
country for a temporary period of time by dissatisfaction with 
the material conditions of their life. Sixty percent cited 
concern for their children's future. The conclusion is not a 
happy one. The results of the survey indicate that of the 29 
million working-age inhabitants of Ukraine, nearly half may 
become migrants and three million may permanently resettle. Add 
to this other members of their families... 
<H3>  NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY HAVE ALREADY LEFT. PERHAPS IT IS 
BETTER THAT WAY... </H3>
  You will not find the number of emigrants at either the 
Ministry of Labor or the Ministry of Nationalities and 
Migration. The statistics kept by the offices of visas and 
registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are seriously 
flawed. To begin with, there is no information regarding how 
many citizens who received permission have actually left, and no 
data has been kept as of January 1993 on temporary travel abroad 
for personal reasons. The state has virtually stopped all forms 
of registration of those leaving the country -- a policy that 
can hardly be called far-sighted. After all, it is essential 
that information on how many citizens have left or are leaving 
and to what destinations be taken into account both in domestic 
socioeconomic policy and in international affairs. 
  At first glance, this does not seem to be a very serious 
problem. In reality, these things are much more complicated. If 
Ukraine is an European state, as our politicians are fond of 
stressing, then why is it not concerned about the image that is 
projected by the thousands of its people receiving assistance 
"over there" who ask for help when they find themselves in dire 
straits. According to data provided by the Polish press alone, 
close to 200,000 former residents of the USSR are working in 
Poland illegally, the majority of them Ukrainians. 
<H5>  LABOR MIGRATION, OR IN SEARCH OF EARNINGS </H5>
  Experts predict that the rate of temporary migration in 
search of work will rise rapidly and will attain a level of 
nearly two million annually. The breakdown of this process will 
look as follows: For the most part, those who leave will be 
highly qualified specialists, scientists, artists, sportsmen -- 
predominantly people with a higher education, who are 
established professionals, ranging in age from 30 to 40 years. 
In other words, the nation's scientific and production elite. 
  Most of the people who will remain abroad for several years 
will work there on the basis of legal contracts. The second 
group will consist of young people, mostly single men without 
sufficient education and professional training. They are now 
working and will continue to work abroad without the necessary 
permits at seasonal, temporary, low-prestige jobs. Even when 
qualified, they often settle for the most physically demanding 
labor. Unprepared, lacking professional and language training, 
lacking information about living conditions abroad, our 
countrymen most often find themselves on the lowest rung of the 
social and professional scale. Western employees do not see a 
big difference between exploiting a semiliterate Asian and a 
qualified but impoverished Ukrainian. So far, Ukraine has not 
joined the multilateral international legal instruments 
governing migrants that would improve her citizens' living 
conditions in the countries that have taken them in.

<F P=106> [Appeal from Peasant Party of Ukraine and Party Candidates </F>
for Supreme Council Deputy Seats to Citizens of Ukraine] 
  [Text] Esteemed Citizens of Ukraine! 
  The nomination phase of the Supreme Council election has 
come 
to an end. The campaign has entered a new stage--meetings of 
candidates for deputy seats with the voters. This communication 
should result in a common acknowledgement of the need for the 
most resolute steps in the renovation of the supreme bodies of 
governmental authority, so that they will be capable of making 
genuinely national policy, returning security, hope, and 
abundance to each family, protecting low-income strata, and 
defining the conclusive strategic guidelines of Ukraine's 
development. 
  This is the time when you, dear Voters, will be asked to 
support the platforms of different political parties and 
movements and will decide the future of our state and our life! 
Each and every party is promising improvement, prosperity, and 
progress. In view of the total collapse of the economy, 
galloping inflation, flourishing corruption and crime, and the 
indigent state of much of the population, the platforms of all 
parties and movements seem appealing, and this will complicate 
your choice. 
  It will be important to make the right choice and to express 
support for the campaign platform defending the vital interests 
of the people, a platform accessible, agreeable, and 
comprehensible to the people who create the state's national 
wealth with their labor. This is the kind of platform we 
propose--the candidates for deputy seats in the Supreme Council 
from the Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU). 
  Our main goal is the establishment of the necessary 
political 
conditions and constitutional guarantees for the revitalization 
of the national economy through the development and 
stabilization of agriculture. At this time, only the vigorous 
development of agricultural production and related branches of 
industry can prevent the absolute disintegration of the economy, 
put an end to poverty and the degradation of society, and lay a 
strong foundation for the accumulation of capital and for 
emergence from the state of crisis. The economic and social 
reforms our party proposes are dictated by our daily life. They 
reflect the ideas and wishes of the peasants, workers, 
employees, and members of the intelligentsia who are still 
sowing and reaping, building homes and schools, and teaching and 
training our children in spite of incredible difficulties. 
  The Peasant Party of Ukraine advocates the further 
democratization of society. The equality of all citizens, 
irrespective of nationality and of social and educational 
status, should guarantee the construction of a modern civilized 
state. This should also be the goal of the present campaign. We 
feel that actions capable of causing ethnic discord and 
confrontations should not be part of this campaign. Instead of 
looking for enemies, we must work together to unite all of the 
people who love Ukraine. 
  Esteemed Voters! The consequences of your choice will be so 
pivotal! By supporting the platform of the Peasant Party, you 
will create new opportunities for the economic revitalization of 
the rural community and, consequently, of all Ukraine! We hope 
that our nomination of members of the laboring public, people 
who know the value of labor and who can and will work for the 
good of society, as candidates for the deputy seats in the 
Supreme Council, will evoke the appropriate feelings of approval 
and support in your hearts! 
  You have done us a great honor, and now we are ready 
and willing to take responsibility for the future of Ukraine. We 
are relying on your support in the election on 27 March 
1994!

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vasilyevich Dovgan, chairman of </F>
Peasant Party of Ukraine and candidate for people's deputy of 
Ukraine from Velikoaleksandrovskiy (Kherson Oblast) Electoral 
District No 400, by G. Dymov; date and place not given: "Sergey 
Dovgan: 'We Will Assume the Responsibility'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, it probably would be best to 
begin by presenting your "calling card".... 
  [Dovgan] It is the same as for any country boy. I have had 
blisters on my hands since I was small. I went to school and 
then to the VUZ, and then I came back to the country, back to 
the land. Anyone who wants to know the details of my biography, 
or simply wants to talk, can contact me any time at the Kosmos 
Sovkhoz in Berislavskiy Rayon. The telephone number is 2-28-93. 
That is where I am on display, so to speak. Besides this, I feel 
that each of us should be judged by his actions, and not by 
academic degrees and professional titles. That is the only way 
to climb out of the present crisis. 
  [Dymov] All right. The farm you head is quite strong, in 
spite of the present economic devastation. You deserve your good 
reputation. What made you want to climb to the heights of 
government? 
  [Dovgan] Everyone defends the peasants during a campaign, 
displaying great pity for them, and then all of this concern 
disappears without a trace when the campaign is over. That is 
why we know this to be true: Anyone who works on the land is our 
candidate. All the rest, the ones who make such lavish promises, 
are just trying to "garner votes," occupy a comfortable 
position, torment us for 2-5 years, and ultimately evade 
responsibility. This was impossible in the past. At that time 
the Supreme Soviet was controlled by the Communist Party, which 
sent the candidates there and then kept them in line. Today, on 
the other hand, if we have independent deputies, policy will be 
made in this way: Whoever pays the piper will call the tune. The 
Peasant Party promises that if our representative becomes a 
deputy, we will be able to put him on the spot, so to speak, at 
any time. We will summon him to the district, where he will have 
to answer to the people for all of his actions. Furthermore, we 
will see to it that other members of the Supreme Council do not 
change their minds as easily as a fancy gentleman changes his 
gloves. The Peasant Party will assume the responsibility for 
this. It will block the efforts of the shape-shifters, the poor 
excuses for politicians whose bid for power is motivated by 
greed. These convictions are the reason I decided to run for 
office. 
  [Dymov] What is the difference, in your opinion, between the 
administrator of a farm and a politician? Have you decided on 
the main issues you would put on the new parliamentary agenda? 
  [Dovgan] We agree with the forces for only one kind of 
independence, the kind in which people will live well, the 
forces capable of establishing beneficial economic relations 
with the rest of the world. I see no difference between 
"secluded" autonomy and self-isolation. That is why we have to 
begin by establishing friendly and mutually beneficial contacts 
with all willing parties. 
  Our foreign policy is a good example. We have no foreign 
policy per se. It has led to one failure after another. We saw 
the treatment we got from the American President. He came to 
Kiev and summoned our president...as if he were issuing an 
order.... This is how we can expect to be treated until we have 
strong partners and friends. I think that Russia and Belarus 
should be the main ones. We have to form military and political 
blocs. After all, the Warsaw bloc broke up, but NATO still 
exists, is dictating its own terms, and feels superior to 
everyone else. In our solitary state, they will drive us to our 
knees. This is my opinion, and I am certain that it is the 
opinion of the majority of our people. At this time, however, I 
am only the administrator of a farm and cannot expect anyone to 
consider my point of view. From the deputy's rostrum, however, I 
will have an opportunity to state my views in the most emphatic 
terms. 
  [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, do you want our state to be a 
presidency or a parliamentary state? 
  [Dovgan] A parliamentary state is the only correct choice. 
There would be less confusion. We elected a president, and he 
does not know what to do.... He let the whole economy collapse. 
Furthermore, there is always the danger of dictatorship. 
  [Dymov] What about the Navy? 
  [Dovgan] Keeping a navy is as inconvenient from the economic 
standpoint as keeping missiles. We have to find a common 
language with the Russians right away. Uniting with them in a 
single state will not work anymore. Today Russia has as many 
problems as we do. The economy there is even more distressed, 
and the crisis is even more severe.... There is not even enough 
money to pay wages. Nevertheless, we have to work together to 
forge a new type of relationship. We have to recover the sales 
markets we lost as soon as possible. Furthermore, we lost huge 
markets "without a battle"--the Russian, Caucasian, Central 
Asian, and Baltic markets. What was the result? All production 
stopped. 
  [Dymov] Sergey Vasilyevich, major policy objectives are 
important over the long term. Today people are worried about 
vital aspects of life. The main one is land reform. What kind of 
advantages will it produce? What kind of adjustments does it 
need to work? 
  [Dovgan] The reform the present members of parliament 
dreamed 
up will not make the state rich. On the contrary, it will hurt 
agriculture. It was forced on us by outside influences. I am 
basing this conclusion partly on data cited by the Belarusian 
Academy of Sciences back in the beginning of the 1990s. 
According to these data, the normal operation of a farm required 
50 million karbovantsy for every 50 hectares. This was a 
considerable sum of money at that time. It was equivalent to the 
gross profits of a farm for five years. In other words, if this 
amount had been issued to each kolkhoz--but where would this 
money have come from even then?--it would have been possible to 
build communism in a single year even without the family farm 
movement. For this reason, what they are doing with the land 
today is a shaky endeavor. 
  What kind of solution does our party propose? We feel that 
the land being worked by kolkhozes and sovkhozes, along with the 
10 percent allocated for family farms, should be divided equally 
among all of the inhabitants of each rural community. Title to 
this land should be transferred to the people by government 
decree. As a rule, the land should be worked collectively. After 
all, the tendency toward consolidation even exists abroad. 
Leasing or selling the land makes no sense, because 20 percent 
of it would have to be used just for boundaries. If our plan is 
carried out, each person will be a property owner--not in the 
abstract or hypothetical sense, but in the real sense of the 
term. In other words, I will earn dividends on my land. If I 
should have to move, I will receive proper compensation for my 
share of the land and then use it to acquire new land when I 
move to another oblast. If there is no available share, I can 
get a job and wait for my turn. In any case, a person should 
have the right to this kind of "exchange." It should be secured 
and protected by law. A parcel would be allocated to each person 
only once, to prevent attempts to corner the market and other 
abuses. Incidents of this kind have already been reported. For 
example, one zealous farmer acquired land simultaneously in 
three neighboring oblasts.... 
  [Dymov] Will this violate the principle of private 
ownership? 
  [Dovgan] That is the least of my worries. I am in favor of 
collective ownership, which is the basis of private ownership. 
This engenders a kind of hybrid of "mine" and "ours," and this 
is normal. After all, neither capitalism nor socialism exists in 
its pure form. 
  [Dymov] Each administrator in our country has rights and 
obligations, but is it not time to institute personal 
responsibility as well? 
  [Dovgan] Yes, a great deal depends on the personality of the 
individual. There is an art to the hiring and placement of 
personnel, but now everything is left to run its own course. I 
recent visited a farm where the administrator--who is even 
younger than I am--had already managed to build a road, 
processing shops, and a school. The local malcontents, however, 
had made life so miserable for this man that he resigned. We 
have to learn to take good care of our personnel. Furthermore, 
we have to draft a set of criteria and precise standards of 
professional advancement. There is good reason that a person who 
wants to run a farm abroad has to have the necessary skills and 
a college degree. 
  As far as responsibility is concerned, I think it should be 
required at every level. Today, in my opinion, top-level 
officials are the most likely to abuse their power. As long as 
they are "inviolable," it will be impossible to restore order. 
  [Dymov] How do you feel, Sergey Vasilyevich, about the 
refusal to let party leaders participate in televised campaign 
debates? 
  [Dovgan] We have no problem with this. I am even happy that 
the young men who were monopolizing the screen have now been 
pushed out of the way. That is their problem. They are afraid to 
talk to the people directly. No one in the labor collectives 
hears them or sees them. Incidentally, when I address the 
peasants of our district and tell them about our party platform, 
they applaud and say they will not vote for the gentlemen who 
come here from Kiev. We will give them our bread, meat, and 
milk--just let them mind their own business and not keep us, the 
people of the land, from being our own masters. Our party was 
founded expressly to defend the peasants. The country is our way 
of life and our cradle. 
  [Dymov] Excuse me, Sergey Vasilyevich, but if you become a 
deputy, you will have to leave your home and move to the 
"asphalt jungle," to an apartment in the capital, and say 
goodbye to your collective. 
  [Dovgan] That does not scare me. After all, I will not be 
leaving forever. If everyone stayed home, who would defend our 
interests on the highest level? As for the apartment, a law 
should be passed right away to give deputies the use of only 
official housing. At the end of the deputy's term, he should 
return the key, get on the train, and go back home. 
  [Dymov] What are the immediate concerns of your 
constituents? 
  [Dovgan] The state has not paid the peasants for delivered 
products, there is no money in the state accounts, and there is 
no money to pay wages. The local buses are not running because 
there is no fuel. There is no fuel for the sowing season either. 
The whole social sphere in the countryside has been "stifled." 
People cannot ride to the hospital, and even if they can get 
there, there is no medicine. You can see big problems wherever 
you look. Nevertheless, I am certain that the people will come 
out to vote, to support us, the representatives of the Peasant 
Party, because they believe that we will not lead them astray, 
that we are the only ones who can make changes for the better.

<F P=106> [Excerpt from article by V. Egorov and V. Zhukovskyy: "What </F>
Is Vladimir Hrynyov, the Man and Politician, Striving For?"] 
  [Excerpt] 
  [Question] The Inter-Regional Reform Bloc mentioned above, 
one should assume, is that pre-election pony, saddling which, 
you want to win the election? 
  [Hrynyov] Not only win, but, what is most important, strive 
for its implementation in life. The people are tired of promises 
which have been coming for many years from state offices. Today, 
however, it is quite clear that current state power structures 
have proven to be profoundly alien to the Ukrainian people and 
can no longer bring them anything but poverty and crises. 
  [Question] Now, six months after your departure, the causes 
of the socioeconomic collapse in Ukraine can probably be seen 
with greater clarity. 
  [Hrynyov] I saw them even then and spoke about them quite 
frankly. Whether they were seen at the summit is another matter. 
Things have gone too far, but I dare assure my countrymen that 
it is still not too late to take control of destiny and halt the 
descent into an abyss. After all we foresaw what happened--empty 
shelves in stores, cold temperatures in the apartments, swift 
devaluation of currency, and impoverishment of low-income 
citizens. Without losing a single day, a single hour, it is 
necessary to halt the disintegration of society and overcome the 
degradation of the state and authority. Through our own 
experience we became convinced that there is a lack of concern 
for man at the highest levels where narrow agency and clannish 
interests predominate killing all rational individual 
initiative. Only a group of skilled and responsible individuals, 
working in a coordinated manner in parliament, in the 
government, and in local administrations will be capable of 
moving Ukraine away from the precipice, from the brink on which 
it stands. 
  [Question] Reports have appeared in the mass media on a 
merger of efforts in that direction by two political 
leaders--Hrynyov and Kuchma, or Kuchma and Hrynyov. 
  [Hrynyov] The order of the names is of no significance 
whatsoever. What is important is that we turned out to be 
thinking along the same lines. I left a high post being 
dissatisfied with it and the same was done somewhat later by 
Leonid Danilovich, seeing how legislative and executive 
structures were nullifying his sincere efforts. In that critical 
situation we pooled our knowledge and experience with the full 
potential of the centrist bloc for the purpose of education and 
the exertion of an active influence on the course of events. Why 
centrist? Both New Ukraine and the PDVU [Party of the Democratic 
Revival of Ukraine] as well as today's reform bloc are based on 
liberal-democratic centrist positions which means that we will 
not accept either the bankrupt pro-communist structures nor some 
adventure-prone, in a number of cases national-radical, 
aspirations. Our concepts are shared by the union of 
industrialists and entrepreneurs which is headed by former Prime 
Minister L. D. Kuchma. 
  Hrynyov believes that the principle that the state exists 
for 
the people and not vice versa is the bulwark of a civilized 
society. The state and its sovereignty are created by citizens 
"from the bottom to the top" for the development and protection 
of their rights and opportunities and not for their restriction, 
which is still far from being eliminated in sovereign Ukraine. 
Therefore the scheme: individual--district--(city)--country must 
be systematically realized. It is specifically with the aid of 
such a scheme that it is possible to utilize skilled 
intellectual forces from the regions and adopt decisions in the 
interests of the individual. 
  Having announced creation of the MBR [Inter-Regional Reform 
Bloc] Hrynyov and Kuchma are not planning on utilizing it only 
for the conduct of the election campaign. By their conviction it 
must be a permanently functioning political force capable of 
influencing the course of events in Ukraine, including 
influence, if you will, through its own faction in parliament, 
which is prepared to assume responsibility before society for 
the management of regions and the country. 
  To that end they are engaging in the formation of 
pre-election coalitions, working with candidates from among the 
regional leaders, elaborating legislative initiatives of the 
bloc, and, of course, earnestly preparing suggestions of the 
bloc regarding personnel selection. The logic behind activity of 
the bloc during the presidential campaign as well, is being 
worked out. Both of the leading candidates will perhaps attempt 
to enter into an honest competition in this area as well. 
  Meantime Vladimir Borisovich is working on his candidacy: in 
his own district he held more than 40 meetings with voters. 
  The first MBR conference took place in Kharkov. Its 
participants adopted a declaration on the formation of the bloc 
and studied the path of Ukraine toward an economic revival, a 
civil society and a civilized state. The confederation cited the 
disastrous consequences which were brought about by destruction 
of the economic space, the fabricated confrontation primarily 
with Russia, the isolationist course of the ruling circles of 
Ukraine, the "great power" cult, and the expensive military and 
political ambitions accompanied by national-patriotic jingoism 
of a portion of the society. 
  Getting better acquainted with the bloc program adopted at 
the conference, we become convinced that much in it has been 
tried and tested. In studying the problem of transformation of 
the state sector of the economy, for instance, the MBR quite 
justifiably gives it a role of the principal producer of goods 
and a source of revenue for the population. As the inevitable 
generator of inflation and an instrument of the destruction of 
the economic potential, however, in the opinion of the author of 
the programs, the state sector must first of all be subjected to 
some well thought-out reforms, without which it is impossible to 
create a full-fledged market environment. That is why Hrynyov 
favors privatization of state enterprises, and their transition 
to various, including corporate, forms of private ownership. 
But, he stresses, inevitably with observance of social justice. 
  Take any point in MBR programs and you will be convinced 
that 
concern for the individual is of paramount importance here. The 
bloc, and naturally, its leaders justly consider that 
suppression of inflation cannot be carried out through 
limitation of the income of the population or by confiscatory 
monetary reforms. The inclusion of land, real estate, and means 
of production in the market turnover is a decisive factor in 
strengthening the monetary system. One more thing: the personal 
funds of citizens in their privatization accounts may amount to 
a substantive share of the growth in credit resources. That 
would suit the main strategy of the reforms proposed by the 
bloc--stabilization not at the expense of the population, but 
against a background and on the condition of a rise in its 
welfare. 
  What can one say? It has been a long time since we have seen 
such concrete, clear, and farsighted proposals for economic 
recovery and resolution of the prolonged crisis. 
  At the same time pragmatic Hrynyov repeatedly pointed out 
the 
factor which is capable of nullifying all of the reforms. It is 
the psychology of the increasingly impoverished population. 
"Just try to conclude that in order to balance the budget and 
lower inflation it is necessary to freeze social subsidies," he 
said. "Our people, particularly young people, are not used to 
living according to their means. They refuse to understand that 
the state redistributes only what is produced by the economy. 
Therefore it appears necessary to earn the daily bread not 
through speculation from vending stands, but in the shops, the 
fields, and on the farms." Creation of new jobs and retraining 
centers is proposed in case of unemployment. 
  Vladimir Borisovich is likewise convinced that the conduct 
of 
social reorientation of the state and the shifting of priorities 
in the direction of the population is possible with its regular 
briefing on expenditures--state and local--of taxpayers money 
with a well-adjusted mechanism of social evaluation of the 
quality of work by organs of power at all levels. 
  The intention of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to eliminate 
political censorship along with social and national prejudice, 
and grant citizens the right for recognition of their native 
languages and everyday languages, are among the priorities aimed 
at the individual, at the protection of his honor and dignity. 
  Speaking at the first MBR conference V. B. Hrynyov also 
presented the main organizational principles underlying the 
activity of the bloc. They include such positions as the 
creation of an electoral coalition, and a data system for the 
communication of central MBR organs with the coalition at the 
local levels, work with candidates from the block, elaboration 
of a detailed program of economic action, and formation of a 
package of priority laws (before entering parliament Brazauskas' 
party in Lithuania published 20 drafts and the MBR plans to 
utilize that experience). 
  Hrynyov attaches considerable significance to the decisions 
of the second MBR conference which ended yesterday at 
Dnepropetrovsk. It was preceded by a sociological monitoring of 
the situation in more than 20 districts in eastern and southern 
Ukraine. In general participants of the conference coordinated a 
platform for the candidates. 
  Two more points, which allow an understanding of the 
prospects should also be noted. It concerns the formation of a 
faction at the third bloc conference, but only after the 
election, and elaboration of parliamentary tactics. That, 
however, will depend on the number of deputies in the bloc. "We 
must realize," Hrynyov stressed, "that the influence of 
representatives from the regions will be like it is in a 
joint-stock company: the number of shares in this faction will 
equal the number of deputies elected." And finally, the 
structure of the future party. "But more about that later," 
Hrynyov noted, after the faction is formed. Without a party 
structure it is impossible to manage the economy and policy. The 
bloc understands that very well. 
  No one is casting doubt on the fact that the activity of the 
Inter-Regional Reform Bloc to a large extent has been initiated 
by Vladimir Borisovich Hrynyov. Taking into account his personal 
qualities--such as constant search for answers to complicated 
questions of political and economic life, strict realism, the 
desire to work and absence of fear of responsibility, one can 
hope that Hrynyov, the man and politician, is preparing to play 
his principal role in life in the nearest future.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Khmelko, doctor of philosophical </F>
sciences, chairman of the department of sociology at the 
University of the Kiev Mohyla Academy [Universytet 
"Kyyevo-Mohylyanska Akademiya"], under the rubric "Politics": 
"Who Supports Which Parties?"] 
  [Text] This question was answered to some degree by the 
representative survey of the adult urban population of Ukraine 
conducted in December by the Kiev International Institute of 
Sociology (KMIS) and the department of sociology of the 
University of the Kiev Mohyla Academy. A total of 1,677 persons 
aged 18 and older were polled y means of interviews in Kiev and 
102 other cities and towns [selyshcha miskoho typu] in all 24 
oblasts and the Republic of Crimea. 
  The first thing that the survey showed is that the 
percentage 
of urban voters who prefer to cast their votes for candidates 
who do not belong to any party is not all that large -- they 
make up 18% of those polled. Twice as many voters are 
inclined 
to vote for candidates put forward by one party or another. Of 
these respondents, 21% have already decided on their 
choice and 
named the party for whose candidates they would vote. Of the 
voters who expressed no preference regarding whether a candidate 
represented a party or not (they number 46%), only 
one-quarter 
is planning to vote in the elections. The attitude to voting in 
the elections is quite different among those supporting parties: 
nearly nine-tenths of them (89%) plan to vote. Among 
supporters 
of candidates that do not belong to any party, the number that 
plans to cast a vote is significantly lower -- 71%. 
  There is more support for party candidates among men 
(39%) 
than women (34%); among members of older generations 
(over 60 
-- 42%, between 46 and 60 -- 38%) than among 
younger voters 
(under 30 --32%, between 31 and 45 -- 33%); among 
those with a 
higher education (41%) than those with a secondary 
education 
(35%) or lower (34%). The proportion of supporters 
of party 
candidates is especially high among managers at various levels 
(48%) and significantly lower among white-collar workers 
(38%), and particularly among specialists (21%). 
  Support for party candidates decreases geographically as one 
moves from west to east and from north to south. Supporters of 
party candidates make up 41% of the electorate in the 
Western 
region, 37% in the Central region, 35% in the 
Eastern region, 
and 34% in the Southern region. In part, this stems from 
the 
fact that there are fewer supporters of party candidates among 
Russians (34%) than among Ukrainians (38%), 
especially among 
Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (40%). 
  The second question to which we sought an answer in our 
study 
was which parties have most supporters and among which 
categories of urban voters. 
  As far as the urban electorate of Ukraine as a whole is 
concerned, at the beginning of the year only three parties had 
voters ready to vote for them in numbers exceeding the 10% 
mark: 16% for the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU), 
13% for 
Rukh, and 11% for the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU). At 
present, these three parties are the largest components of the 
multiparty political system that is forming in Ukraine. They are 
its "first rank," so to speak. 
  he "second rank" in this system, numbering fewer than 
10% 
supporters but no less than 5%, is currently "vacant." No 
party 
has the support of this percentage of voters. 
  The "third rank" of political parties among the urban 
electorate consists of five parties, each of which is supported 
by less than 5% but more than 2.5% of the 
electorate. These 
are the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine (PDVU), the Green 
Party of Ukraine (PZU), the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine 
(SDPU), the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SocPU), and the 
Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS) -- each with 3% 
supporters. 
  The last, "fourth rank" is comprised of nine parties, each 
of 
which has the support of at least 1% of the electorate. 
(We 
should point out that 1% of the urban electorate of 
Ukraine 
amounts to more than 250,000 persons.) The Peasant Party of 
Ukraine has the support of 2% of the urban voters, while 
the 
Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Liberal Party, the 
People's Party, the Party of Labor, the Labor Congress of 
Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Ukrainian Peasant 
Democratic Party, and the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine 
each have 1%. 
  An analysis of the data makes it possible to determine the 
breakdown of support enjoyed by the named parties among various 
categories of the urban electorate. Thus, the number of 
supporters of the DemPU among men is 1.5 times greater than 
among women (18% as against 12%). The ratio 
between the 
supporters of Rukh is the same (14% as against 
9%). In 
contrast, the KPU has almost twice as many supporters among 
women than among men (14% as compared to 8%). In 
addition, the 
5% "hurdle" is cleared by men in the case of the SocPU 
and by 
women in the case of the UPS. 
  The leading position of the DemPU is particularly marked 
among young voters. It is supported by 18% of those under 
30 
years of age as against 7% for Rukh, 6% for the 
KPU and the 
UPS, and 5% for the PDVU and the PZU. Most appealing to 
voters 
between the ages of 31 and 45 are Rukh (16%) and the DemPU 
(14%), while the "second rank" of parties includes the KPU 
(6%) and the SDPU (5%). The highest degree of 
support among 
voters between 45 and 60 goes to Rukh (17%) and the KPU 
(15%), 
somewhat less to the DemPU (12%), and 6% of these 
voters and 
voters over 60 prefer the SocPU. Among the latter group, only 
5% support Rukh, and the leaders are the KPU (17%) 
and the 
DemPU (16%). 
  Among voters with a lower than secondary education, support 
is highest for the KPU (16%). The DemPU has only 
11% and Rukh 
7% in this category. The DemPU has more supporters among 
those 
with a secondary education (17%) than Rukh (13%) 
and the KPU 
(11%). Whereas voters with a higher education are more 
inclined 
to prefer Rukh (14%) and the DemPU (13%) than the 
KPU (9%), 
and 6% of voters in this category are ready to support 
the PZU 
and the SocPU. 
  Among blue-collar workers, support runs highest for Rukh 
(18%) and the DemPU (14%), and no other party 
reaches the 5% 
mark. The Communist Party has the support of only 3% of 
blue-collar workers, and the Socialist Party of only 1%. 
Among 
white-collar workers there is more support for the KPU and Rukh 
(14% each) than for the DemPU (10%). In addition, 
7% of the 
white-collar workers are inclined to support the PZU and 
6% the 
PDVU. Among specialists and the technical and humanitarian 
intelligentsia, support also runs highest for the KPU and Rukh 
(14%), but third and fourth place in this group is shared 
by 
the PDVU and the SocPU (9% each), while the DemPU has 
only 5% 
of supporters -- the same number as the SDPU and the Labor 
Congress of Ukraine. 
  In the Western region, only two parties have the support of 
more than 5% of the polled urban voters, but Rukh has 
more than 
1.5 times as many supporters as the DemPU with a ratio of 29:18. 
Only these two parties are supported by more than 10% of 
the 
urban population of the Central region: Rukh -- 18% and 
the 
DemPU -- 15%. Three parties fall into the "second rank" 
here: 
the KPU with 9%, the SocPU with 7%, and the UPS 
with 5%. 
Among the urban electorate in the Southern region, first and 
second place are shared by the DemPU and the KPU (16% 
each). 
Rukh has the support of only 7% of the electorate here, 
and the 
PDVU and the Peasants' Party, of 5% each. In the Eastern 
region, support among urban voters runs highest for the KPU 
(14%) and the DemPU (12%). The SDPU is in third 
place here 
(5%), while Rukh is supported by only 2%. 
  This breakdown of support for the different parties in the 
regions is rather closely linked with the breakdown of 
supporters in the principal ethnic and linguistic-ethnic groups. 
Among urban Russian voters, the KPU has markedly more supporters 
(16%) than the DemPU (12%), and many more than 
Rukh (3%). 
Conversely, the KPU has markedly fewer supporters among urban 
Ukrainian voters (10%) than the DemPU (15%) and 
Rukh (15%). 
While there are significantly more supporters of the KPU among 
Russian-speaking Ukrainians than among Ukrainian-speaking 
Ukrainians (14% as compared to 4%), and, 
conversely, Rukh has 
many more supporters among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians than 
among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (24% as against 
9%), DemPU 
has almost an equal number of supporters among all Ukrainians -- 
16% among Russian-speaking Ukrainians and 15% among 
Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians. 
  In examining the above data, it is important to keep in mind 
that our elections will be held in accordance with a majority 
electoral system rather than a proportional one, and therefore 
the final distribution of deputy mandates among the 
representatives of the various parties and candidates with no 
party affiliation may differ considerably from the proportions 
described above.

<H6>  1. </H6>
  Two years have gone by since our government, without giving 
the matter much thought, followed in the footsteps of "older 
brother" Russia and liberated the prices of consumer goods and 
services. These prices are now skyrocketing madly. The output of 
goods is falling. This is happening at such an accelerated pace 
that by the fall of 1993 Ukraine's economy fell into the grip of 
hyperinflation bearing all the signs of economic collapse. 
  Those who choose not to see the principal reason for this 
terrible situation in the economy are trying to attribute it to 
the rupture of economic ties with the sovereign states that made 
up the former USSR and, above all, with Russia. Others, who 
lament the decline of the command-distributive system of 
management, believe that the sole cause of our economic disaster 
is the disruption of the state's management of the economy. 
  But as life is showing us, neither the creation of the 
commonwealth of independent states, which was to have restored 
interstate ties, nor even the launching of an economic union 
conceived for the purpose of ultimately reviving the political 
union (read: transforming the USSR), nor the attempt by former 
Prime Minister Kuchma to restore the centralized system of state 
management are capable of halting the economic collapse. 
  The principal reason for our unremitting descent into an 
economic abyss is the complete inaction on the part of the 
Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine in the sphere of economic and sociopolitical change 
while in unanimous agreement only on the liberalization of 
prices. 
  Unfortunately, in contrast to Russia, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, and Poland, for example, Ukraine has produced no state 
leaders with sufficient will, ability, and, above all, desire to 
firmly and fundamentally implement radical economic and 
sociopolitical change. A struggle for power, political and 
ideological strife between the former party-nomenklatura group 
and today's democratic groupings, multiplied by wariness, 
self-satisfaction, and complete professional ignorance, and an 
unprecedented flowering of the mafia and shadow elements have 
all resulted in the formation of an ineffective ruling center, 
whose ambiguous and insufficiently founded actions make it very 
similar to the former Union center. 
  As in the days when the USSR still existed, there is a 
growing body of opinion within the borders of independent 
Ukraine that the fate of economic rebirth, and thus the fate of 
millions of ordinary citizens of Ukraine, should not be decided 
by the center, but at the local level, for a given region. Even 
Leonid Kuchma in his farewell address at the eighth session of 
the Supreme Council last September said that the center is no 
longer able to decide socioeconomic issues and that more and 
more often these matters are being handled in the regions. This 
is indeed the case. Moreover, the inaction at the top with 
respect to economic changes is stirring up separatist 
sentiments, particularly in regions where the Russian-speaking 
population constitutes a majority. In voting for the 
independence of Ukraine, these people cherished the hope that 
they would enjoy a better life than they had had before, 
especially compared with neighboring Russia. When this did not 
happen, a significant number of the people came to regard 
independence, especially Ukrainian independence, as fate's 
bitter irony. For these people (their place of residence is the 
Soviet Union), a "sausage prosperity" is far more important than 
Ukrainian statehood, let alone Ukrainian patriotism. The most 
important evidence supporting their argument is the condition of 
the economy, whose improvement is awaited by virtually the whole 
population of Ukraine. 
<H6>  2. </H6>
  The disparity between the declarations of the government and 
the president and the actions that actually accompany these 
declarations on economic reforms (take, for example, the 
decisions on privatization that were passed by the Supreme 
Council in the form of two programs, one for 1992 and the second 
for 1993, but not implemented) is leading to a situation in 
which under pressure from enterprising individuals, local 
government organs (usually city organs) in some regions are 
beginning to reform their economies on their own. Without 
waiting for directives from above, they are carrying out 
so-called small privatization, which, unfortunately, even in 
these regions is progressing at a very slack pace (estimates 
show that only some 1,500 objects have been privatized). To 
defend their actions, more than 100 local communal property 
privatization organs have joined together in their own 
association. 
  But as long as power remains in the hands of people who wait 
for instructions from above, we cannot expect to see any 
significant changes in the conduct of economic reforms in 
Ukraine. Together, the local nomenklatura and the center have 
already made their "contribution" to what is widely known in 
international economic circles as the "Ukrainization of the 
economy" -- in other words, a knack for destroying the economy. 
  Even in an ideal situation (something we can only imagine), 
if the onservative officials are successfully replaced by 
reformers (but where are we to find them?), the necessary 
changes will not be made for two reasons: first, because all 
changes will be implemented only on the initiative of the 
center, whose directives will not always suit the specific 
conditions of a given territory's development, and, second, 
because without the opportunity to show initiative, local 
government organs will not always be interested in executing the 
directives issuing from the top. It is therefore essential to 
reach agreement regarding national as opposed to regional 
interests in effecting economic changes and to use this as a 
basis for implementing an active territorial policy of economic 
reforms. This would relax the tension in relations between the 
center and the regions and transfer the burden of economic and 
social problems to the local level. All strata of the population 
would then be directing questions about their life to their 
local government organs and themselves instead of the president 
or government of Ukraine. Moreover, the separatist flames that 
flare up from time to time in various regions of Ukraine would 
die away. And if someone were to fan them, there would be 
grounds on which to extinguish them. Whereas, quite frankly, no 
such grounds exist today, because the regions have virtually no 
economic independence. 
<H6>  3. </H6>
  What does the economic independence of regions mean? In the 
transition to a market economy, and even more so once market 
relations are in effect, every economic entity, every structure 
within the economic system, and especially every region, must be 
economically independent. Unfortunately, some leaders, who have 
no understanding of real politics and even less of economics, 
define economic independence as economic autonomy, which, for 
the most part, is intertwined with political independence and 
ultimately leads to state separatism. 
  The theory and practice of market relations prove that 
economic independence means, above all, a region's right to 
choose its own paths and methods of economic and social 
development and to manage at its own discretion within the 
framework of state laws but relying on local initiative and the 
region's resource, production, and scientific potential. Thus 
all economic and social gains become the attainment of the 
region, whose fate is decided without interference from the 
center but with national interests taken into account. 
  Today, Ukraine's various regions are attaining different 
degrees and forms of economic independence by methods that are 
for the most part uncivilized. The regions use different ways to 
win this independence. ome, like the Republic of Crimea, do so 
by way of social destabilization and threatening to join Russia, 
ultimately succeeding in getting the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
to pass legislation granting it limited economic autonomy. 
Others -- Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk 
oblasts -- also playing the Russian card, force the president to 
issue an edict permitting them to conduct an experiment in which 
the oblast state administrations manage all objects, including 
those owned by the state. The third category -- Odessa Oblast -- 
passes a decision in the oblast council of people's deputies and 
then requests the Supreme Council, the president, and the 
Cabinet of Ministers to grant it permission to also conduct an 
experiment in full-fledged economic independence. The fourth 
category -- Zakarpattya Oblast -- has elected a legitimate 
course towards economic autonomy through the creation of a free 
economic zone on the territory of the entire oblast. 
  An analysis of the situation shows that the center, fearing 
separatist sentiments, limits the powers of regions in the 
sphere of economic independence. For example, having won 
autonomy, the Crimean Republic nevertheless has limited economic 
rights, under which the principles of self-sufficiency and 
self-financing do not function. The fact of the matter is that 
the republic's economy is subordinated to the national 
centralized system of financing, taxation, and, to a certain 
extent, with respect to the supply of materials and equipment. 
Even its socioeconomic growth indices are coordinated with the 
central ministries and departments. That the Crimean Republic's 
economy is dependent on the state cauldron is also confirmed by 
the fact that last year more than 60 percent of the republic's 
budget expenditures were covered by the state. It should be 
noted, however, that to some extent these funds were linked with 
the center's desire to reduce the social tensions that were 
constantly present in this region and which were giving rise to 
separatist sentiments. 
  To avoid this diversity of ways and negative results of 
attaining economic independence by various regions, the center 
should view this independence as an objective factor essential 
to the effective development of Ukraine as market relations are 
established. The state should make provision for this 
independence in its territorial policy and pass appropriate 
legislation to secure it. On the basis of this legislation, as 
well as a mechanism for implementing economic independence 
developed in advance, all regions, regardless of their level of 
development, should be granted economic freedom and allowed to 
exercise it in accordance with their self-governing powers. It 
is undesirable, however, for some regions to be granted more and 
others fewer economic powers, which, unfortunately, is something 
that we are witnessing in regions that are successfully wresting 
economic power for themselves. Economic inequality will lead to 
a social stratification of the regions, and this will provoke 
sociopolitical tensions.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. Kornev, head of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I </F>
ZHIZN's information center in Ukraine: "Ukraine: The Real Estate 
Market as a Barometer of Government Reforms"] 
  [Text] The situation on the real estate market is one 
of the most sensitive barometers of the progress of countries of 
the former USSR along the path of economic reforms. Here it is 
clear to see how the real mechanisms of property are formed. 
  To facilitate analysis of this problem, we will divide 
all real estate into two parts: that which belongs to 
enterprises (state as well as private), which we will call 
production real estate, and that which is owned by citizens as 
private property, which we will call citizens' property. 
<H5>  Unfinished Projects and Others (Production Real Estate) </H5>
  The processes of destatization of property in Ukraine are 
determined by the laws on large and small privatization that 
were adopted by parliament a year and a half ago. But for all 
practical purposes, they have not begun to function: The 1992 
and 1993 state privatization plans have come to naught, although 
official figures also cite such a statistic as the fact that 
1,570 enterprises have been privatized. The main form of 
privatization today is leasing to buy. In 1993, 1,306 
enterprises were privatized, and 978 enterprises were in the 
process. Why is property taking such a long time to find real 
owners? What is going on here? Who is at fault? Some see a 
population that does not wish to become owners; others, a state 
that is in no hurry when it comes to a real transition to the 
market. In fact, preparations are being made for wide-scale 
privatization. In a very distinctive way. 
  Here is the point of view of an expert--the influential 
Ukrainian people's deputy V. Filenko: "The corporatization and 
breaking up of large enterprises, readjustment, 
commercialization, and other unavoidable preliminary measures 
are proceeding too slowly, and to some extent are only being 
mimicked. But then, the fussy changing around of signboards and 
the formation in the state sector of pseudo-market structures 
and small enterprises parasitizing state property is forging 
ahead at full speed. On the one hand, these are means for 
pumping public funds, or property, too, into private pockets; on 
the other hand, it is the seizure of convenient starting 
positions, which after the proclamation of mass privatization 
should automatically lead to the preferential transition of the 
best enterprises into the hands of privileged claimants. 
  According to a scenario that may be carried out, mass 
privatization will formally be begun at such time as the actual 
privatization of highly profitable enterprises is concluded. 
There are not a few tasty morsels, and one cannot put one's 
hands on them all simultaneously. So they are dallying with the 
privatization in order to gain time: "The lion is getting ready 
to spring." 
  But what is happening at the surface of this process? All of 
the laws and decrees on privatization remain only a declaration. 
At auctions where municipally owned enterprises are sold, which 
have taken place in Lvov, Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev, Zaporozhye, 
Odessa, and other cities, and were held, as also in the 
beginning in Russia (Nizhniy Novgorod, St. Petersburg) under the 
patronage of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), in 
fact what was sold was not the objects of immovable property, 
but the right to their lease. 
  The auctions themselves, especially in Kiev, proceeded in 
not 
very organized fashion--there were protests of the participants 
and of the procurators about the fact that a number of 
enterprises under dual authority were incorrectly presented for 
bidding. For example, a store on the first story of a 
departmental building has two owners--the organization that 
constructed the building and the municipal authorities. A whole 
range of enterprises was withdrawn from the trading for this 
reason. 
  The edict of the president of Ukraine on corporatization 
placed the beginning of privatization of medium-sized and large 
state enterprises on the basis of the creation of joint-stock 
companies. The process has really been in progress since October 
and November of last year. Only 78 such companies have been 
created. 
  In the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, great hopes were 
placed on the privatization of unfinished construction projects. 
In October of last year, the president of Ukraine signed the 
relevant edict. It seemed that the matter would quickly be 
"wound up." After all, in the republic, as we were informed by 
R. Kuzmin, a leading specialist of the Property Fund's 
administration of state enterprise privatization, there are 
53,000 unfinished projects of state or municipal ownership, 
including 22,000 at which no construction was conducted in 1993, 
and 9,200 that are 50 percent ready and whose construction was 
taking twice as long as the norm. 
  In the middle of January throughout Ukraine, about 100 
privatization projects were "put to work." And every month 
during the course of this year the same number should be added 
to those. Here it is determined that clients who have financed 
the construction through centralized capital investments will at 
sale receive 30 percent of the cost of the unfinished project, 
and those who built using their own funds will receive all 100 
percent. The privatization of plots of land is resolved 
simultaneously with the unfinished project itself. 
  It appeared that the process would "move ahead." However, by 
February throughout Ukraine, only 50 sellers of dragged-out 
construction projects had been scraped together. The role of 
"dog in the manger" turned out to be played by the local organs 
of executive authority. In oblasts like Donetsk, Lugansk, and 
Sumy there turned out to be only 10 overdue construction 
projects apiece, and in Khmelnitskiy, not a single one. One can 
understand the managers' desire to hold back "their" 
construction until better times, to justify as state motives the 
necessity of its continuation. But they, as was stressed at a 
recent meeting at the Cabinet of Ministers, will be heard 
sympathetically by the privatization commission under one set of 
circumstances: when there are on hand or planned for the near 
term real funds for the completion of construction. Otherwise, 
the auction will judge who has the greatest opportunity and 
desire to bring the overdue construction project "to reason" and 
become its owner. 
  For the time being, even out of 9,200 50-percent completed 
projects, only three overdue construction projects have been 
completed. Although the number of their bypassed "brothers" 
promises to increase. According to data of the Cabinet of 
Ministers economics administration, of 343 projects planned to 
be put into operation by state contract, only 16 have been put 
into operation. 
  Ukraine is living through difficult times. This is the third 
year that the fall in production has continued, which has 
reached catastrophic bounds. The control levers over the money 
supply have been lost. The average monthly inflation rate 
reached 80 percent in December, that is, the stage of 
hyperinflation began. The population's standard of living was 
reduced to such an extent that one segment of the citizenry is 
forced to worry about physical survival. This is an 
unprecedented situation for a country not in a state of war. It 
would probably not be an exaggeration to say that Ukraine's path 
to a new democratic society and a market economy has turned out 
to be more difficult than that of other European countries that 
have escaped from totalitarianism. It is difficult to expect 
that the private sector will begin to invest its capital on a 
massive scale in industrial immovable property in conditions of 
economic instability and a lack of clear legal guarantees.

Property) </H3>
  The housing market, essentially, has always existed. It is 
just that in different times, its affiliation with such of its 
forms as legal, semilegal, and "black" has changed. After all, 
10 years ago everyone also knew perfectly well that an exchange 
of apartments was a veiled form of trade in them, and that the 
office dealing with apartment exchanges and the placement of 
advertisements simply screened a ramified network of apartment 
brokers, who clearly knew the price of a square meter of living 
space. 
  The housing market began to take on clearer outlines in the 
past four years. This is connected most of all with the 
appearance of more liberal legislative acts and with buyers and 
sellers having more precise information on prices for real 
estate, thanks to numerous advertisements and announcements in 
the press and the emergence of exchanges and real estate 
agencies, specialized brokers' offices, and a ramified network 
of middlemen. 
  "Three years ago," says L. Gruskene, president of the 
Kristina Ukrainian real estate exchange, "we were selling 
apartments for R30,000, R50,000, R70,000, whereas now the tally 
is kept in the hundreds of millions of karbovantsy. At the end 
of 1990, one could buy a good two-room apartment in downtown 
Kiev for $2,000-$3,000. And when we cited such prices to buyers, 
they perceived them as absolutely improbably high. Whereas now 
such an apartment is evaluated at seven or eight times higher." 
  In 1991-1992, the high cost of housing in Kiev was 
determined 
by the projected interest in Ukraine on the part of foreign 
investors, who were attracted by the new markets, the highly 
optimistic statements by the Ukrainian leadership on the 
building of a market economy, and the liberal law on foreign 
investments. They actively acquired apartments for offices and 
agencies. This also applied to Ukrainian commercial structures, 
the entrepreneurial elite, who purchased prestigious housing in 
the central part of the city. 
  Now purchasing power is falling. The interest of foreigners 
in Ukraine, as a result of economic instability and the absence 
of legal guarantees, has declined sharply. Our own nouveaux 
riches have basically satisfied their own requirements. 
  There is now on the market a large quantity of mid-level 
apartments, which are not finding buyers. Their potential takers 
are people of fairly decent means, but they do not have the 
necessary funds at their disposal. Therefore, demand for real 
estate is falling. Over the year, prices for an apartment in 
Kiev have fallen by 15-25 percent. 
  Here is the analysis presented by the analytical service of 
the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, which is a leader in the 
sale of apartments, dachas, and garages. The volume of deals 
involving real estate in 1993 comprised 178.5 billion 
karbovantsy. The number of contracts concluded was 3,470. At the 
end of December 1993, the proportional share of apartments 
according to location in the total volume of those available 
constituted: apartments located on the outskirts of town--29 
percent; downtown--27 percent; near metro stations--26 percent; 
in regions adjoining downtown districts--19 percent. The 
greatest proportional share in the total volume of those 
available was made up of three-room apartments--38 percent--and 
two-room apartments--37 percent. One-room apartments make up 14 
percent of the total. The average price of a single square meter 
of housing space amounted to: for apartments located in the 
center of town--$940; in regions adjoining the center--$795; 
near metro stations--$572; and on the outskirts of town--$502. 
The offered cost of one square meter of living space at the end 
of December 1993, as compared with the beginning of the month, 
decreased by 3 percent, on average. Prices for apartments of 
various classes in the city of Kiev are given in the table. 
  It is necessary to keep in mind here that an analysis of 
concluded deals pertaining to real estate in Ukraine is made 
more complicated. The government decree adopted at the beginning 
of the year on currency regulation prohibits settlements on the 
exchanges from being conducted in foreign currency. And 
hyperinflation renders senseless the calculation of real estate 
values in Ukrainian karbovantsy. Therefore, the reality is such: 
The contract, for the record, is concluded in karbovantsy, but 
is in practice settled in dollars or marks. Here their own 
collisions could arise, but the brokers have learned to get 
around them. 
  In the opinion of S. Babich, general director of the 
Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, 30 percent of those who now 
sell apartments effect their resale at a profit to themselves. 
  "In order sharply to decrease the price of apartments 
offered 
for sale and to find an additional source of replenishment for 
the city budget," he notes, "We proposed to the Kiev 
administration to sell at auction 100-200 newly constructed 
apartments quarterly. But they did not do this. But really, at 
that time there was the possibility of creating a full-blooded 
real estate market and to regulate it in the interests of 
various strata of the population." 
  Aside from Kiev, the sale and purchase of citizens' real 
estate is fairly well developed in Kharkov, Lvov, Odessa, and 
Crimea. In these cities, the cost of housing amounts to on the 
order of 60 percent of that in the capital. In contrast to the 
Baltic countries, Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and Moldova, in 
Ukraine the migration of the Russian-speaking population to 
Russia has practically not been felt in the housing market. A 
portion of the well-off citizens of Ukraine has displayed a 
desire to acquire real estate in Moscow and in other cities of 
Russia. But the share of buyers from the CIS among those wishing 
to become owners of real estate in Ukraine is negligible. 
  Among the most famous firms involved in the purchase and 
sale 
of apartments, dachas, and garages, in Ukraine the most famous 
are the Ukrainian exchange Desyatinnaya, the Ukrainian real 
estate exchange Kristina (which is a component of the Praveks 
concern), the Kiev Universal Exchange, the Yanus real estate 
agency, and Kommersant-D in Odessa. These and other firms at the 
end of 1993 signed a founding agreement on the creation of the 
Association of Realtors of Ukraine, whose president is to be N. 
Detochka, head of the Kiev Universal Exchange. The task of the 
association is to create consultative information services and 
to facilitate collaboration with its colleagues in different 
countries. 
  The law adopted in Ukraine last year on mortgages gives an 
opportunity to develop mortgage lending. And the unquestioned 
leader here is the Praveks concern. Two of its component 
members, the Ukrainian real estate exchange Kristina and the 
Praveks-bank, are engaged in the apportionment of currency 
credit to physical persons under security of immovable property, 
especially apartments. Here, you will not get a loan greater 
than half the value of your apartment in dollars, and if you 
fail to return the amount, the apartment will be sold at a 
profit. Besides the Praveks-bank, the banks IKAB (Kiev) and Land 
Union (the city of Chernovtsy) are getting involved in mortgages. 
  Since the Ukrainian International Currency Exchange was 
closed, the real estate market has remained just about the only 
barometer allowing for a determination of real benefit from the 
government reforms. Therefore, when asked for a prognosis of 
real estate prices in 1994, Ukraine's realtors give roughly the 
following answer: "Let us wait until 27 March." That is the date 
of the elections to the republican parliament. 
  So then--the market really is eternal and has existed 
always. 
Only in three guises: legal, semilegal, and "black." The 
Ukrainian market will be kept from "blackening" further simply 
by social pressure of the population, which has reached its 
limit. There is only one way out: to become legal. And this will 
probably be the main task of the party in power.
